The former residence of the Anhalt-Bernburg princes is known for its Renaissance castle. Geography The town centre is situated in the fertile Magdeburg B√∂rde lowland on the Saale river, approx. downstream from Halle and up stream from Magdeburg. It is dominated by the huge Bernburg Castle featuring a museum as well as a popular, recently updated bear pit in its moat. The municipal area comprises the villages of Baalberge, Biendorf, Gr√∂na, Pei√üen, Poley, Preu√ülitz, and Wohlsdorf, all incorporated on 1 January 2010. Bernburg is a stop on the scenic Romanesque Road (Strasse der Romanik). History Several archaeological sites in the area refer to the Walternienburg-Bernburg Culture, a mid-neolithic funnelbeaker culture from about 3200 to 2800 BC. Agriculture on the fertile Loess soil was already common in prehistoric times. Around 150 AD, a local settlement named Luppia was mentioned in the Geography by Ptolemy. In the Early Middle Ages, the Saale river marked the border between the German stem duchies in the west and the lands of the Polabian Slavs in the east. The present-day borough of Waldau (which became part of Bernburg in 1871) was first mentioned in a 782 deed and again in 806 as Waladala in the chronicles of Moissac Abbey; the village church dedicated to St Stephen first appeared in 964, the nowadays building dates from around 1150. Bernburg itself was first mentioned as civitas Brandanburg in a 961 deed issued by King Otto I of Germany. According to the Annalista Saxo, Berneburch Castle, then a possession of the Ascanian prince Albert the Bear, was set on fire by his enemies in 1138. In 1252 the rebuilt castle became the residence of Albert's great-grandson Prince Bernhard I of Anhalt-Bernburg. Bernburg memorial In the Nazi era during World War II, a wing of the town's mental hospital was used for the so-called T-4 Euthanasia Programme. The site today houses a memorial to commemorate the suffering of more than 14,000 victims.

History and operations Established in 1941, the BMGR is primarily used for air-to-ground bombing practice by United States Air Force pilots flying A-10s from Davis‚ÄìMonthan Air Force Base, F-16s and F-35 Lightning IIs from Luke Air Force Base and Tucson Air National Guard Base, and United States Marine Corps pilots and naval flight officers in F/A-18 Hornets, AV-8B Harriers and F-35Bs flying from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. It is also used by other U.S. and NATO/Allied/Coalition flight crews while deployed to any of the aforementioned bases for training. According to a U.S. Air Force spokesman, \\"The Barry M.

As you take that geography and look at the military in those three cities you have roughly 20 squadrons that use the range day in, day out as their backyard range.

There are three tactical ranges available spanning several hundred square miles each, and containing and two full-size airfield mockups. The area includes the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field which serves as an emergency landing location for pilots and flight crews training on the ranges. The U.S. Air Force operates the eastern portion of the BMGR while the U.S. Marine Corps operates the western portion. The range was named after five-term U.S. Senator, Barry M. Goldwater from Arizona. Goldwater received a reserve commission in the U.S. Army Air Forces when America entered World War II. Following World War II, Goldwater was a leading proponent of creating the U.S. Air Force Academy. As a Colonel, he also founded the Arizona Air National Guard and eventually retired as a command pilot with the rank of Major General. By the end of his career, he had flown 165 different types of aircraft. Illegal immigrants crossing the BMGR Crews install 30-foot (9.1 m) barrier along the Barry M. Goldwater Range's U.S.-Mexico border Despite warning signs along its southern perimeter in English and Spanish stating that the BMGR is U.S. Government property, that it is an active military bombing range and that unauthorized entry is prohibited, the BMGR remains among the treacherous access areas southwest of Tucson for Mexican, Salvadoran, and other Central and South American migrants illegally crossing into the United States, where many have perished. Aid workers trying to save people from dying have signed up for annual passes to access the BMGR, including a waiver of liability for live bombing, but some workers have been banned and threatened with trespassing charges, citing property policy that requires everything packed in to also be brought out. In August 2018, The Marshall Project reported in an interview on the progressive news program Democracy Now! about deaths on this dangerous and off-limits bombing area, where humanitarian aid - like food or even water - is impossible to deliver. Freelance Mexican-American investigative reporter John Carlos Frey said that a team from the volunteer search-and-rescue group, Aguilas del Desierto - ‚ÄúEagles of the Desert,‚Äù discovered a dozen bodies in a small area they were allowed to search for two weekends, but fear at least hundreds more have died there, referencing the mass graves discovered in a Texas cemetery along a migrant travel corridor in 2014, but the government isn't allowing any further property search.

It implements the SPARC V9 instruction set architecture (ISA), the first microprocessor to do so. SPARC64 was HAL's first microprocessor and was the first in the SPARC64 brand. It operates at 101 and 118 MHz. The SPARC64 was used exclusively by Fujitsu in their systems; the first systems, the Fujitsu HALstation Model 330 and Model 350 workstations, were formally announced in September 1995 and were introduced in October 1995, two years late.\\"HAL Finally Comes To Market With 64-Bit HALstation Line\\" It was succeeded by the SPARC64 II (previously known as the SPARC64+) in 1996.  Description  The SPARC64 is a superscalar microprocessor that issues four instructions per cycle and executes them out of order. It is a multichip design, consisting of seven dies: a CPU die, MMU die, four CACHE dies and a CLOCK die.  CPU die  The CPU die contains the majority of logic, all of the execution units and a level 0 (L0) instruction cache. The execution units consist of two integer units, address units, floating-point units (FPUs), memory units. The FPU hardware consists of a fused multiply add (FMA) unit and a divide unit. But the FMA instructions are really fused (that is, with a single rounding) only as of SPARC64 VI.\\"SPARC64 VI Extensions\\" page 56, Fujitsu Limited, Release 1.3, 27 March 2007 The FMA unit is pipelined and has a four-cycle latency and a one-cycle-throughput. The divide unit is not pipelined and has significantly longer latencies. The L0 instruction cache has a capacity of 4 KB, is direct-mapped and has a one-cycle latency. The CPU die is connected to the CACHE and MMU dies by ten 64-bit buses. Four address buses carrying virtual addresses lead out to each cache die. Two data buses write data from the register file to the two CACHE dies that implement the data cache. Four buses, one from each CACHE die, deliver data or instructions to the CPU. The CPU die contained 2.7 million transistors, has dimensions of 17.53 mm by 16.92 mm for an area of 297 mm2 and has 817 signal bumps and 1,695 power bumps.  MMU die  The MMU die contains the memory management unit, cache controller and the external interfaces. The SPARC64 has separate interfaces for memory and input/output (I/O). The bus used to access the memory is 128 bits wide. The system interface is the HAL I/O (HIO) bus, a 64-bit asynchronous bus. The MMU has a die area of 163 mm2.  Cache dies  Four dies implement the level 1 (L1) instruction and data caches, which require two dies each. Both caches have a capacity of 128 KB. The latency for both caches is three cycles, and the caches are four-way set associative. The data cache is protected by error correcting code (ECC) and parity. It uses a 128-byte line size. Each CACHE die implements 64 KB of the cache and a portion of the cache tags. The cache die contains 4.3 million transistors, has dimensions of 14.0 mm by 10.11 mm for a die area of 142 mm2. It has 1,854 solder bumps, of which 446 are signals and 1408 are power.  Physical  The SPARC64 consisted of 21.9 million transistors. It was fabricated by Fujitsu in their CS-55 process, a 0.40 Œºm, four-layer metal complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. The seven dies are packaged in a rectangular ceramic multi-chip module (MCM), connected to the underside of the MCM with solder bumps. The MCM has 565 pins, of which 286 are signal pins and 218 are power pins, organized as a pin grid array (PGA). The MCM has wide buses which connect the seven dies.  SPARC64 II  The SPARC64 II (SPARC64+) was a further development of the SPARC64. It is a second-generation SPARC64 microprocessor. It operated at 141 and 161 MHz. It was used by Fujitsu in their HALstation Model 375 (141 MHz) and Model 385 (161 MHz) workstations, which were introduced in November 1996 and December 1996, respectively. The SPARC64 II was succeeded by the SPARC64 III in 1998. The SPARC64 II has higher performance due to higher clock frequencies enabled by the new process and circuit tweaks; and a higher instructions per cycle (IPC) count due to the following microarchitecture improvements: * The capacity of the level 0 (L0) instruction cache was doubled to 8 KB. * The number of physical registers was increased to 128 from 116 and the number of register files to five from four. * The number of branch history table entries was doubled to 2,048. It was fabricated by Fujitsu in their CS-60 process, a 0.35 Œºm, five-layer metal CMOS process.SPARC II Product Overview The new process reduced the area of the dies, with the CPU die measuring 202 mm2, the MMU die 103 mm2, and the CACHE die 84 mm2.  SPARC64 GP  The SPARC64 GP is a series of related microprocessors developed by HAL and Fujitsu used in the Fujitsu GP7000F and PrimePower servers. The first SPARC64 GP was a further development of the SPARC64 II.Song, \\"HAL Packs SPARC64; onto Single Chip\\". It was a third- generation SPARC64 microprocessor and was known as the SPARC64 III before it was introduced. The SPARC64 GP operated at clock frequencies of 225, 250 and 275 MHz . It was the first microprocessor from HAL to support multiprocessing. The main competitors were the HP PA-8500, IBM POWER3 and Sun UltraSPARC II. The SPARC64 GP was taped out in July 1997. It was announced on 11 April 1998, with 225 and 250 MHz versions were introduced in December 1998. A 275 MHz version was introduced in March 1999. It was a single-die implementation of the SPARC64 II that integrated, with modifications, the CPU die and two of the four CACHE dies. Numerous modifications and improvements were made to the microarchitecture, such as the replacement of the MMU and a new system interface using the Ultra Port Architecture. It had improved branch prediction, an extra pipeline stage to improve clock frequencies and a second FPU which could execute add and subtract instructions. A FPU of less functionality was added instead of a duplicate of the first to save die area; the second FPU is half the size of the first. It has a three-cycle latency for all instructions. The complex SPARC64 II memory management unit (MMU) was replaced with a simpler one that is compatible with the Solaris operating system. Previously, SPARC64 systems ran SPARC64/OS, a derivative of Solaris developed by HAL that supported the SPARC64. The L1 caches were halved in capacity to 64 KB from 128 KB to reduce die area (the reason why only two of the four CACHE dies were integrated from the SPARC64 II). The associated performance loss was mitigated by the provision of a large external L2 cache with a capacity of 1 to 16 MB. The L2 cache is accessed with a dedicated 128-bit data bus that operates at the same or half clock frequency of the microprocessor. The L2 cache is inclusive, that is it is a super-set of the L1 caches. Both L1 and L2 cache have their data protected by ECC and their tags by parity. The SPARC64 II's proprietary system interface was replaced by one compatible with the Ultra Port Architecture. This enabled the SPARC64 III to use chipsets from Sun Microelectronics. The system bus operates at half, a third, quarter or fifth the frequency of the microprocessor, up to a maximum of 150 MHz. It contained 17.6 million transistors, of which 6 million are for logic and 11.6 million are contained in the caches and TLBs. The die has an area of 210 mm2. It was fabricated by Fujitsu in their CS-70 process, a 0.24 Œºm, five-layer metal, CMOS process. It is packaged in a 957-pad flip-chip land grid array (LGA) package with dimensions of 42.5 mm by 42.5 mm. Of the 957 pads, 552 are for signals and 405 are for power and ground. Internal voltage is 2.5 V, I/O voltage is 3.3 V. Peak power consumption of 60 W at 275 MHz. The Ultra Port Architecture (UPA) signals are compatible with 3.3 V Low Voltage Transistor Transistor Logic (LVTTL) levels with the exception of differential clock signals which are compatible with 3.3 V pseudo emitter coupled logic (PECL) levels.  Later versions  The second and third SPARC64 GPs are fourth generation SPARC64 microprocessors. The second SPARC64 GP was a further development of the first and it operated at 400 to 563 MHz. The first versions, operating at 400 and 450 MHz were introduced on 1 August 2000. It had larger L1 instruction and data caches, doubled in capacity to 128 KB each; better branch prediction as the result of a larger BHT consisting of 16,384 entries; support for the Visual Instruction Set (VIS); and a L2 cache built from double data rate (DDR) SRAM. It contained 30 million transistors and was fabricated by Fujitsu in their CS80 process, a 0.18 Œºm CMOS process with six levels of copper interconnect. It used a 1.8 V internal power supply and a 2.5 or 3.3 V power supply for I/O. It was packaged in a 1,206-contact ball grid array (BGA) measuring 37.5 mm by 37.5 mm. of the 1,206 contacts, 552 are signals and 405 are power or ground. The third SPARC64 GP was identical to the second in terms of microarchitecture. It operated at 600 to 810 MHz. First versions were introduced in 2001. 700, 788 and 810 MHz versions introduced on 17 July 2002.Fujitsu's PRIMEPOWER Servers Get Another Big Performance Boost It was fabricated by Fujitsu in their 0.15 Œºm CS85 process with six levels of copper interconnect.

This is usually expressed as a capital adequacy ratio of equity as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. These requirements are put into place to ensure that these institutions do not take on excess leverage and risk becoming insolvent. Capital requirements govern the ratio of equity to debt, recorded on the liabilities and equity side of a firm's balance sheet. They should not be confused with reserve requirements, which govern the assets side of a bank's balance sheet‚Äîin particular, the proportion of its assets it must hold in cash or highly-liquid assets. Capital is a source of funds not a use of funds. Regulations A key part of bank regulation is to make sure that firms operating in the industry are prudently managed. The aim is to protect the firms themselves, their customers, the government (which is liable for the cost of deposit insurance in the event of a bank failure) and the economy, by establishing rules to make sure that these institutions hold enough capital to ensure continuation of a safe and efficient market and are able to withstand any foreseeable problems. The main international effort to establish rules around capital requirements has been the Basel Accords, published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision housed at the Bank for International Settlements. This sets a framework on how banks and depository institutions must calculate their capital. After obtaining the capital ratios, the bank capital adequacy can be assessed and regulated. In 1988, the Committee decided to introduce a capital measurement system commonly referred to as Basel I. In June 2004 this framework was replaced by a significantly more complex capital adequacy framework commonly known as Basel II. Following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, Basel II was replaced by Basel III,Page 27, Basel III:A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems which will be gradually phased in between 2013 and 2019.Basel III phase-in arrangements Another term commonly used in the context of the frameworks is economic capital, which can be thought of as the capital level bank shareholders would choose in the absence of capital regulation. For a detailed study on the differences between these two definitions of capital, refer to Economic and Regulatory Capital in Banking: What is the Difference. The capital ratio is the percentage of a bank's capital to its risk-weighted assets. Weights are defined by risk-sensitivity ratios whose calculation is dictated under the relevant Accord. Basel II requires that the total capital ratio must be no lower than 8%. Each national regulator normally has a very slightly different way of calculating bank capital, designed to meet the common requirements within their individual national legal framework. Most developed countries implement Basel I and II, stipulate lending limits as a multiple of a bank's capital eroded by the yearly inflation rate. The 5 Cs of Credit - Character, Cash Flow, Collateral, Conditions and Covenants- have been replaced by one single criterion. While the international standards of bank capital were established in the 1988 Basel I accord, Basel II makes significant alterations to the interpretation, if not the calculation, of the capital requirement. Examples of national regulators implementing Basel include the FSA in the UK, BaFin in Germany, OSFI in Canada, Banca d'Italia in Italy. In the United States the primary regulators implementing Basel include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve. In the European Union member states have enacted capital requirements based on the Capital Adequacy Directive CAD1 issued in 1993 and CAD2 issued in 1998. In the United States, depository institutions are subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB).FDIC:Capital measures and capital category definition These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy based primarily on the perceived credit risk associated with balance sheet assets, as well as certain off-balance sheet exposures such as unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit, and derivatives and foreign exchange contracts. The risk-based capital guidelines are supplemented by a leverage ratio requirement. To be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio of at least 8%, and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, and not be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. To be well-capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio of at least 10%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. These capital ratios are reported quarterly on the Call Report or Thrift Financial Report. Although Tier 1 capital has traditionally been emphasized, in the Late-2000s recession regulators and investors began to focus on tangible common equity, which is different from Tier 1 capital in that it excludes preferred equity.Stress Test for Banks Exposes Rift on Wall St.. NYTimes. Regulatory capital requirements typically (although not always) are imposed at both an individual bank entity level and at a group (or sub-group) level. This may therefore mean that several different regulatory capital regimes apply throughout a bank group at different levels, each under the supervision of a different regulator. Regulatory capital In the Basel II accord bank capital has been divided into two \\"tiers\\" , each with some subdivisions. Tier 1 capital Tier 1 capital, the more important of the two, consists largely of shareholders' equity and disclosed reserves. This is the amount paid up to originally purchase the stock (or shares) of the Bank (not the amount those shares are currently trading for on the stock exchange), retained profits subtracting accumulated losses, and other qualifiable Tier 1 capital securities (see below). In simple terms, if the original stockholders contributed $100 to buy their stock and the Bank has made $20 in retained earnings each year since, paid out no dividends, had no other forms of capital and made no losses, after 10 years the Bank's tier one capital would be $300. Shareholders equity and retained earnings are now commonly referred to as \\"Core\\" Tier 1 capital, whereas Tier 1 is core Tier 1 together with other qualifying Tier 1 capital securities. In India, the Tier 1 capital is defined as \\"'Tier I Capital' means \\"owned fund\\" as reduced by investment in shares of other non-banking financial companies and in shares, debentures, bonds, outstanding loans and advances including hire purchase and lease finance made to and deposits with subsidiaries and companies in the same group exceeding, in aggregate, ten per cent of the owned fund; and perpetual debt instruments issued by a systemically important non-deposit taking non-banking financial company in each year to the extent it does not exceed 15% of the aggregate Tier I Capital of such company as on March 31 of the previous accounting year;\\" (as per Non-Banking Financial (Non-Deposit Accepting or Holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2007) In the context of NBFCs in India, the Tier I capital is nothing but net owned funds. Owned funds stand for paid up equity capital, preference shares which are compulsorily convertible into equity, free reserves, balance in share premium account and capital reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of asset, excluding reserves created by revaluation of asset, as reduced by accumulated loss balance, book value of intangible assets and deferred revenue expenditure, if any. Tier 2 (supplementary) capital Tier 2 capital, supplementary capital, comprises undisclosed reserves, revaluation reserves, general provisions, hybrid instruments and subordinated term debt. =Undisclosed reserves= Undisclosed reserves are where a bank has made a profit but this has not appeared in normal retained profits or in general reserves. =Revaluation reserves= A revaluation reserve is a reserve created when a company has an asset revalued and an increase in value is brought to account. A simple example may be where a bank owns the land and building of its headquarters and bought them for $100 a century ago. A current revaluation is very likely to show a large increase in value. The increase would be added to a revaluation reserve. =General provisions= A general provision is created when a company is aware that a loss has occurred, but is not certain of the exact nature of that loss. Under pre-IFRS accounting standards, general provisions were commonly created to provide for losses that were expected in the future. As these did not represent incurred losses, regulators tended to allow them to be counted as capital. =Hybrid debt capital instruments= They consist of instruments which combine certain characteristics of equity as well as debt. They can be included in supplementary capital if they are able to support losses on an ongoing basis without triggering liquidation. Sometimes, it includes instruments which are initially issued with interest obligation (e.g. debentures) but the same can later be converted into capital. =Subordinated-term debt= Subordinated debt is classed as Lower Tier 2 debt, usually has a maturity of a minimum of 10 years and ranks senior to Tier 1 capital, but subordinate to senior debt in terms of claims on liquidation proceeds. To ensure that the amount of capital outstanding doesn't fall sharply once a Lower Tier 2 issue matures and, for example, not be replaced, the regulator demands that the amount that is qualifiable as Tier 2 capital amortises (i.e. reduces) on a straight line basis from maturity minus 5 years (e.g. a 1bn issue would only count as worth 800m in calculating capital 4 years before maturity). The remainder qualifies as senior issuance. For this reason many Lower Tier 2 instruments were issued as 10 year non-call 5 year issues (i.e. final maturity after 10 years but callable after 5 years). If not called, issue has a large step - similar to Tier 1 - thereby making the call more likely. Different international implementations Regulators in each country have some discretion on how they implement capital requirements in their jurisdiction. For example, it has been reportedBoyd, Tony, \\"A Capital Idea\\", 21 October 2008 that Australia's Commonwealth Bank is measured as having 7.6% Tier 1 capital under the rules of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, but this would be measured as 10.1% if the bank was under the jurisdiction of the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority. This demonstrates that international differences in implementation of the rule can vary considerably in their level of strictness. European Union In the EU countries the capital requirements as set out by Basel III agreement have been implemented by the so-called CRD IV package which commonly refers to both the EU Directive 2013/36/EU and the EU Regulation 575/2013.

Shafer at Neshaminy High School, Langhorne, PA, May 1967. Raymond Philip \\"Ray\\" Shafer (March 5, 1917 ‚Äì December 12, 2006) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 39th Governor of Pennsylvania from 1967 to 1971. Prior to that, he served as the 23rd Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania from 1963 to 1967 and a Pennsylvania State Senator from 1959 to 1962. He was a national leader of the moderate wing of the Republican Party in the late 1960s. Early life and career Shafer was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, the youngest of the five children of the Rev. David Philip Shafer and his wife Mina Belle (Miller). In 1933, Shafer's father moved the family to Meadville, Pennsylvania to accept a position as pastor of the First Christian Church. Shafer became an Eagle Scout and as an adult was presented the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the Boy Scouts of America. He graduated from high school in Meadville in 1934 as valedictorian of his class. After finishing high school, Shafer attended Allegheny College from 1934 to 1938, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and served as class president. He graduated, Phi Beta Kappa, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and political science and was a candidate for a Rhodes Scholarship. At Allegheny, Shafer was an accomplished athlete, achieving all- Pennsylvania honors in basketball and all-American honors in soccer. In 1938, Shafer enrolled at Yale Law School and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1941. Several Yale classmates, such as William Scranton and Gerald Ford, would help shape his future political career. The summer after graduating law school, on July 5, 1941, Shafer married Jane Harris Davies, whom he had met at Allegheny. The couple had three children together. In 1942, Shafer entered the United States Navy as a naval intelligence officer and later served on PT boats. He participated in over 80 combat missions during World War II on PT boats as commanding officer of PT-359 and later as executive officer of Squadron 27. As Squadron XO, Shafer sailed aboard PT-375, one of the first PT boats to penetrate the defenses of Manila Bay, Philippines, during the Battle of Manila. Shafer earned the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, as well as the rank of lieutenant during his tour in the Pacific theater. Shafer returned to Meadville after the war and entered private law practice. His political career began in 1948 when he was elected district attorney of Crawford County, a position in which Shafer would serve two terms. In 1958, he was elected to the State Senate to represent the 50th District, consisting of portions of Crawford and Mercer counties, and while in that office began to amass a liberal-tending voting record in support of such initiatives as anti-housing discrimination. Governor of Pennsylvania=1966 campaign In 1962, Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Scranton tapped Shafer as his running mate. Scranton had been Shafer's classmate at Yale, and both were considered moderate Republicans. The Scranton/Shafer ticket won the election over the Democratic ticket led by Philadelphia Mayor Richardson Dilworth and State Representative Stephen McCann, the House Majority Leader. Scranton was limited to one term under then-existing state law and Shafer was considered the most likely choice to succeed him as the Republican nominee. In the general election, he faced wealthy Philadelphia businessman Milton Shapp. The 1966 election was marked by tragedies. Pennsylvania Attorney General Walter Alessandroni, Shafer's running mate, was killed in an aviation accident during the campaign and won the nomination for Lieutenant Governor posthumously; Ray Broderick was named to replace him on the ticket. Former governor David L. Lawrence collapsed and fell into a coma during a campaign appearance for Shapp, and died later that November. On election day, Shafer was victorious by a margin of nearly a quarter of a million votes. Tenure (1967‚Äì71) Shafer was inaugurated in January 1967 and became the first governor to reside in the modern Governor's Mansion in Harrisburg. As governor, Shafer was best known for championing reforms to the state constitution. In 1963, Lieutenant Governor Shafer had chaired a bipartisan committee to explore constitutional reforms and had made reforms a part of his campaign platform in 1966. By the end of Shafer's first year as governor, in December 1967, a constitutional convention was meeting to overhaul state government. Reforms approved by the electorate following this convention, in April 1968, included revisions to home rule, audit of state finances, and a new unified judiciary under the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Shafer emerged as a national figure in the moderate wing of the Republican Party during the 1968 election, giving the nominating speech for New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller at the 1968 Republican National Convention, although the delegates instead chose former Vice President Richard Nixon as the party's presidential candidate. Shafer himself had received votes in Pennsylvania's presidential primary and initially received support from a majority of Pennsylvania's 64-member convention delegation as a favorite son candidate; he used this leverage in a partially successful attempt to move the Pennsylvania delegation into Rockefeller's column. After Shafer's death, his surviving children told The New York Times that Nixon had offered Shafer the vice presidential spot to balance the ticket with an Eastern moderate, though there is no surviving record to that effect. Nixon ultimately chose Maryland governor Spiro Agnew. Shafer oversaw an expansion of Pennsylvania's highway system, dedicated several portions of the Interstate Highway System in the state, and authorized a merger of four agencies to form the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). Large expenditures for education and health programs Shafer authorized caused budget deficits by the 1969‚Äì70 fiscal year. To balance the budget, Shafer sought Pennsylvania's first state income tax, a move that made him unpopular with many voters, though later settled for an increase in the state sales tax. Ultimately, Shafer's successor as governor, Milton Shapp, would sign into law a state income tax. Shafer also dealt with the 1969 York Race Riot in which Shafer declared a state of emergency and sent 200 National Guard troops into the city. In 1969, Shafer ascended to the vice- chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association and succeeded California governor Ronald Reagan as chair in 1970. Although the new 1968 constitution allowed incumbent governors to run for reelection, Shafer was bound by the previous rules and was limited to one term. He campaigned for Ray Broderick, his lieutenant governor, as his successor. Although Broderick publicly opposed a state income tax, he was unable to escape the shadow of Shafer, who had proposed it. The 1970 election saw a Democratic sweep, with Milton Shapp elected governor and Democrats gaining control of both houses of the General Assembly for the first time in over 30 years. Shafer left office following the expiration of his term and inauguration of governor-elect Shapp in January 1971. Post-gubernatorial career=Shafer Commission After leaving state government, Shafer had initially hoped to be appointed to a federal judgeship on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, though he ultimately did not receive an appointment and withdrew his candidacy for the bench in 1972. In the meantime, President Nixon appointed Shafer as chairman of the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse, also known as the Shafer Commission. He was criticized in this role by many conservatives after the panel recommended the decriminalization of marijuana use. The commission's recommendation was ultimately not followed by the Nixon administration, though some, such as Eric Sterling of HuffPost, argue that the proposal was \\"ahead of its time.\\" Later life and legacy Later, Shafer served a brief stint as CEO of financially troubled TelePrompter company. Following Watergate, he returned to public service after being named special counsel to new Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, a position he held from 1974 to 1977. From 1977 to 1988 he was a partner and senior counselor with the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand and also maintained a law practice in Meadville. He served briefly as president of his alma mater, Allegheny College, from 1985 to 1986, and on the Council on Foreign Relations. Shafer died at the age of 89 in Meadville, Pennsylvania, on December 12, 2006. He was buried with military honors at St. John's Cemetery in Union Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania. Shafer was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Drexel University in 1968. In addition, a section of Interstate 79 in Pennsylvania is named \\"The Raymond P. Shafer Highway\\" after him, as are residence halls at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania and Indiana University of Pennsylvania and the auditorium at Allegheny College.

It is generally recommended for use with other antiretroviral medication. It may be used to prevent mother to child spread during birth but is not recommended following other exposures. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include rash, headache, nausea, feeling tired, and liver problems. The liver problems and skin rash may be severe and should be checked for during the first few months of treatment. It appears to be safe for use during pregnancy. It is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and works by blocking the function of reverse transcriptase. Nevirapine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. Medical uses Nevirapine is used in adults and in children 6 years of age infected with HIV-1 as part of combination antiretroviral treatment (ART or cART). Monotherapy with nevirapine is not indicated due to rapid emergence of resistance. Nevirapine in triple combination therapy has been shown to suppress viral load effectively when used as initial antiretroviral therapy (i.e., in antiretroviral-naive patients). Some clinical trials have demonstrated comparable HIV suppression with nevirapine-based regimens to that achieved with regimens based on a protease inhibitor (PI) or efavirenz. This drug is generally only to be considered for use if the CD4 cell count is very low. Although concerns have been raised about nevirapine-based regimens in those starting therapy with high viral load or low CD4 count, some analyses suggest that nevirapine may be effective in this group of people. Nevirapine may also form a useful component of salvage regimens after virological failure, usually in combination with one or more PIs as well as nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs), especially in those who have not previously taken an NNRTI. Dosing in children is based on body surface area (BSA), however, weight-based dosing algorithms have been released. These guidelines include dosing algorithms for as young as newborn babies. Preventing mother-to-child transmission A single dose of nevirapine given to both mother and child reduced the rate of HIV transmission by almost 50% compared with a very short course of zidovudine (AZT) prophylaxis, in a clinical trial in Uganda. A subsequent study in Thailand showed that prophylaxis with single-dose nevirapine in addition to zidovudine is more effective than zidovudine alone.Lallemant M, Gonzague Jourdain G, Sophie Le Coeur S, et al. (2004) Single-Dose Perinatal Nevirapine plus Standard Zidovudine to Prevent Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV-1 in Thailand. N Engl J Med 351: 217-28 These and other trials have led the World Health Organization to endorse the use of single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis in many developing world settings as a cost-effective way of reducing mother-to-child transmission. However, in the United States the Ugandan study was deemed flawed The HIVNET 012 Study and the Safety and Effectiveness of Nevirapine in Preventing Mother-to-Infant Transmission of HIV, and as of 2006 the FDA has not approved of such nevirapine prophylaxis.Celia Farber, \\"Out of Control: AIDS and the Corruption of Science\\" However, supporters of HIVNET 012 experiment argued that the flaws in this experiment were largely due to bureaucratic incompetence, while the findings regarding the safety and efficacy of single-dose nevirapine from this study were scientifically solid and too important to discard.Crane, J 2010, 'Adverse events and placebo effects: African scientists, HIV, and ethics in the 'global health sciences, Social Studies Of Science, 40, 6, pp. 843-870 http://sss.sagepub.com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au/content/40/6/843.full.pdf+html Moreover, it was argued that holding African researchers who operated under resource-poor situations to the same moral and procedural standards to their Western counterparts was unrealistic, and would further marginalize African researchers' role in the science community and impede the progress of African science.Lock, M. & Nguyen, V 2010, an Anthropology of Biomedicine, Malden, Wiley-Blackwell. Another clinical trial, Using Nevirapine to Prevent Mother- to-Child HIV Transmission During Breastfeeding, was completed in September 2013. A major concern with this approach is that NNRTI resistance mutations are commonly observed in both mothers and infants after single-dose nevirapine, and may compromise the response to future NNRTI-containing regimens. A short course of maternal zidovudine/lamivudine is recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service Task Force to reduce this risk. Adverse effects The most common adverse effect of nevirapine is the development of mild or moderate rash (13%). Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been observed in 1.5% of patients, including Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity. Nevirapine may cause severe or life-threatening liver toxicity, usually emerging in the first six weeks of treatment.DHHS panel.

(Available for download from AIDSInfo ) In 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning on nevirapine, warning that it could cause life-threatening liver toxicity and skin reactions.Viramune XR (nevirapine) FDA Prescribing Information Unacceptably high risk of serious liver symptoms in certain patient groups (women with CD4 count >250 and men >400) has led the U.S. DHHS to recommend the restriction of nevirapine use to those at lower risk, unless the benefit to the patient clearly outweighs the risk; although in the 2NN study which found these CD4 limits, the effect was seen only in patients recruited from Thailand. More recent studies on the use of Nevirapine in people with higher CD4 cell counts have come to the following conclusion: Treatment-experienced patients who start NVP-based combination therapy with low pre‚ÄìART and high current CD4 cell counts and an undetectable VL have a similar likelihood for discontinuing NVP therapy because of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), compared with treatment-naive patients with low CD4 cell counts. This suggests that NVP-based combination therapy may be safely initiated in such patients. However, in similar patients with a detectable VL, it is prudent to continue to adhere to current CD4 cell count thresholds. The U.S. Public Health Service Task Force advocates caution in the use of nevirapine in pregnancy due to toxicity issues, which may be exacerbated during pregnancy.Panel on Treatment of HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission. Recommendations for use of antiretroviral drugs in pregnant HIV-1-infected women for maternal health and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States. . Accessed 16 November 2016. Cases of immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution have also been observed with this drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends stopping nevirapine if a person experiences: * sign and symptoms of liver issues such as hepatitis * increased transaminases in addition to rash or systemic symptoms * formation of rash with systemic symptoms * severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions Additionally, the U.S. FDA recommends close monitoring during the first 6 weeks of therapy for the above symptoms as there is high risk during this time. Continued monitoring is recommended for up to the first 18 weeks of treatment. If a patient experiences hepatitis plus rash or other systemic symptoms, or severe hypersensitivity or skin rash, nevirapine should not be restarted. Drug interactions Nevirapine is a substrate for liver CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes. Concomitant administration of drugs that are inhibitors of these enzymes may increase serum nevirapine levels significantly. Some examples of these drugs include ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fluconazole. On the other hand, drugs that are inducers of these enzymes such as rifampicin may lower serum nevirapine levels.[18] In addition, concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum, which has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP1A2) or St. John's wort containing products may significantly lower nevirapine levels. Nevirapine is an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. It may reduce levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals efavirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, as well as clarithromycin, ketoconazole, forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone. Mechanism of action Nevirapine shown in ball and stick structure. Nevirapine falls in the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class of antiretrovirals. Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RTIs inhibit the same target, the reverse transcriptase enzyme, an essential viral enzyme which transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Unlike nucleoside RTIs, which bind at the polymerase active site, NNRTIs bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the subdomain of p66 which is about 10 angstrom away from the active site (known as the NNRTI pocket). Therefore, this NNRTI-binding pocket will inhibit reverse transcription in a way that is distinct to the NRTIs. Nevirapine is not effective against HIV-2, as the pocket of the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase has a different structure, which confers intrinsic resistance to the NNRTI class. Resistance to nevirapine develops rapidly if viral replication is not completely suppressed. The most common mutations observed after nevirapine treatment are Y181C and K103N, which are also observed with other NNRTIs.Viramune (nevirapine) tablets; Viramune (nevirapine) oral suspension prescribing information As all NNRTIs bind within the same pocket, viral strains which are resistant to nevirapine are usually also resistant to the other NNRTIs, efavirenz and delavirdine. However, second generation NNRTIs like rilpivirine and etravirine are effective in treatment for HIV strains resistant to nevirapine and other first generation drugs in that same class. History Nevirapine was discovered by Karl D. Hargrave and colleagues at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the Boehringer Ingelheim group of companies. It is covered by U.S. Patent 5,366,972 and corresponding foreign patents. Nevirapine was the first NNRTI approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was approved June 21, 1996 for adults and September 11, 1998 for children. It was also approved in Europe in 1997. Society and culture Former U.S. President George W. Bush's PEPFAR funding of $500 million to help combat the African AIDS epidemic included nevirapine, among other medications and programs.

It originally aired on February 9, 1962 on CBS. Opening narrationPlot Charles Whitley (Ernest Truex), a retiree at Sunnyvale Rest Home, thinks he has discovered the secret of youth. He is convinced that if he acts young, he will become young. His oldest and best friend Ben Conroy (Russell Collins), whom he has known since childhood, thinks he is going crazy, and is able to persuade the home's superintendent, Mr. Cox (John Marley) that this is the case. Mr. Cox decides to put Charles in isolation and under observation. Ben tries to convince Charles to act as sedate as the other residents in order to avoid this fate, to no avail. While Ben sees aging as an inescapable fact of life, Charles is convinced that Ben's thinking of himself as old is what made him old. That night, Charles convinces a number of residents to play a game of kick the can with him. He tries to talk Ben into joining them, but Ben refuses. The residents light a firecracker and throw it out a window, the noise drawing the nurse's attention so they can sneak out the door. Meanwhile, Ben alerts Mr. Cox to what the other residents are up to. They run outside to find a group of children playing kick the can instead. Ben recognizes one of the children as Charles, who has become young again. He begs young Charley for a chance to go with him, but the boy seems not to know him, and dashes away into the darkness. Mr. Cox searches elsewhere for the elderly residents, while Ben walks slowly to the front steps of Sunnyvale and sits there with the can, alone, knowing that Mr. Cox can look all he wants for the residents... and that he will never find them.

In this version, an old man named Mr. Bloom has just moved into Sunnyvale Retirement Home. He listens to the other elders reminisce about the joys they experienced in their youth. Mr. Bloom says just because they are old does not mean they cannot enjoy life anymore. He tells them that later that night, he will wake them and that they can join him in a game of kick the can. Leo Conroy objects, saying that now that they are all old they cannot engage in physical activity. While Mr. Conroy sleeps, Mr. Bloom gathers the rest of the residents outside and plays the game, during which they are transformed into childhood versions of themselves. They are ecstatic to be young again and engage in activities they enjoyed long ago, but their thoughts soon turn to practical matters such as where they will spend the night, since they will no longer be welcomed in the retirement home and their families won't recognize them. They ask to be old again. Mr. Bloom grants their wish. Leo Conroy wakes up and witnesses one resident, Mr. Agee, who still remains young, and asks for Agee to take him along. Agee tells Conroy that he cannot go with him. The segment ends with Conroy kicking a can around the yard, hoping to recreate the spell that made Agee young again, while Mr. Bloom leaves Sunnyvale and moves into another retirement home, to spread his good-natured magical skills to other senior citizens.

Curtis, 1903 Apache wickiup A wigwam, wickiup, wetu,\\"Wigwams, also called wetus, were houses used by the Algonquian Indians who lived in the woodland regions. Wigwam means \\"house\\" in the Abenaki tribe and wetu means \\"house\\" in the Wampanoag tribe.\\" A Historical Look at American Indians. [books.google.com/books?id=iavZMkdjp0MC] or wiigiiwaam in the Ojibwe language, is a semi-permanent domed dwelling formerly used by certain Native American tribes and First Nations people. They are still used for ceremonial events. The term wickiup is generally used to label these kinds of dwellings in the Southwestern United States and Western United States, while wigwam is usually applied to these structures in the Northeastern United States as well as eastern Canada (Ontario and Quebec). Wetu is the Wampanoag term for a wigwam dwelling. These terms can refer to many distinct types of Native American structures regardless of location or cultural group. The wigwam is not to be confused with the Native Plains teepee, which has a very different construction, structure, and use. Structure Paiute wickiup The domed, round shelter was used by numerous northeastern Native American tribes. The curved surfaces make it an ideal shelter for all kinds of conditions. Aboriginal Canadians in eastern Ontario and Quebec would reside in either wigwams or longhouses. These structures are formed with a frame of arched poles, most often wooden, which are covered with some sort of bark roofing material. Details of construction vary with the culture and local availability of materials. Some of the roofing materials used include grass, brush, bark, rushes, mats, reeds, hides or cloth. Dakota-style tipis and Ojibwe wigwam, White Earth, Minnesota, 1928 Ojibwe wigwam, from an 1846 painting by Paul Kane Wigwams were most often seasonal structures although the term is applied to rounded and conical structures built by Native Americans/First Nations people that were more permanent. Wigwams usually take longer to put up than tipis. Their frames are usually not portable like a tipi. A typical wigwam in the Northeast had a curved surface which can hold up against the worst weather. Young green tree saplings of just about any type of wood, ten to fifteen feet long, were cut down and bent. While the saplings were being bent, a circle was drawn on the ground. The diameter of the circle varied from ten to sixteen feet. The bent saplings were then placed over the drawn circle, using the tallest saplings in the middle and the shorter ones on the outside. The saplings formed arches all in one direction on the circle. The next set of saplings were used to wrap around the wigwam to give the shelter support. When the two sets of saplings were finally tied together, the sides and roof were placed on it. The sides of the wigwam were usually bark stripped from trees. The male of the family was responsible for the framing of the wigwam. Mary Rowlandson uses the term Wigwam in reference to the dwelling places of the Native Americans that she stayed with while in their captivity during King Philip's War in 1675. The term wigwam has remained in common English usage as a synonym for any \\"Indian house\\"; however this usage is incorrect as there are known differences between the wigwam and the tipi within the Native American community. During the American revolution the term wigwam was used by British soldiers to describe a wide variety of makeshift structures.For a complete description, see \\"We are now ... properly ... enwigwamed.\\" British Soldiers and Brush Huts, 1776‚Äì1781, John U. Rees, 2003 (originally published in the Military Collector & Historian, volume 55, number 2 (Summer 2003), 89-96. Wickiups of the west Wickiups were used by different indigenous peoples of the Great Basin, Southwest, and Pacific Coast. They were single room, dome- shaped dwellings, with a great deal of variation in size, shape, and materials. The Acjachemen, an indigenous people of California, built cone- shaped huts made of willow branches covered with brush or mats made of tule leaves. Known as Kiichas, the temporary shelters were utilized for sleeping or as refuge in cases of inclement weather. When a dwelling reached the end of its practical life it was simply burned, and a replacement erected in its place in about a day's time. Below is a description of Chiricahua wickiups recorded by anthropologist Morris Opler: The home in which the family lives is made by the men and is ordinarily a circular, dome-shaped brush dwelling, with the floor at ground level. It is eight feet high at the center and approximately seven feet in diameter. To build it, long fresh poles of oak or willow are driven into the ground or placed in holes made with a digging stick. These poles, which form the framework, are arranged at one-foot intervals and are bound together at the top with yucca-leaf strands. Over them a thatching of bundles of big bluestem grass or bear grass is tied, shingle style, with yucca strings. A smoke hole opens above a central fireplace. A hide, suspended at the entrance, is fixed on a cross-beam so that it may be swung forward or backward. The doorway may face in any direction. For waterproofing, pieces of hide are thrown over the outer hatching, and in rainy weather, if a fire is not needed, even the smoke hole is covered. In warm, dry weather much of the outer roofing is stripped off. It takes approximately three days to erect a sturdy dwelling of this type. These houses are \\"warm and comfortable even though there is a big snow.\\" The interior is lined with brush and grass beds over which robes are spread....Opler: 22‚Äì23 Image:Wikiup.jpgIllustration of an Acjachemen wickiup, California File:Ribs of Apache wickiup.jpgFrame of Apache wickiup File:Chiricahua medicine man.jpgChiricahua medicine man and family in wickiup File:Ute wickiup.jpgUte wickiup File:Snow pic of old frame wickiup.jpgFrame of Crow sweat lodge in snow \\"Wigwam\\" in different Algonquian languages The English word wigwam derives from Eastern Abenaki wigw√¥m, from Proto-Algonquian *wi¬∑kiwa¬∑ îmi.

Early life Born in Colchester, Fairfax County, Virginia, Henderson was one of six sons of successful merchant Alexander Henderson and Sarah (Sally) Moore. He was raised at the Henderson House in Dumfries, Virginia until he joined the Marine Corps at the age of 18.Marine Corps Museums, \\"Henderson House: The Home of Alexander Henderson\\" (Quantico, Virginia, 1968), p. 2. Career The Henderson family monument in the Congressional cemetery, Washington DC Archibald Henderson was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on 4 June 1806 and served aboard USS Constitution during her famous victories in the War of 1812. He participated in several shipboard engagements and was decorated for bravery. He was brevetted a major in 1814. From 16 September 1818 to 2 March 1819, Henderson was the acting Commandant. On 17 October 1820, at age 37, Lt. Colonel Henderson was appointed the Commandant of the Marine Corps. He served for a little over 38 years, the longest of any officer to hold that position. Henderson is credited with thwarting attempts by President Andrew Jackson to combine the Marine Corps with the Army in 1829. Instead, Congress passed the Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps in 1834, ensuring the Marines would remain part of the United States Department of the Navy. He was promoted to colonel the same year. He went into the field as Commandant during the Indian campaigns in Florida and Georgia during 1836 and 1837, and was promoted brevet brigadier general in 1843 for his actions in these campaigns. Tradition says that he pinned a note to his door: \\"Gone to Florida to fight the Indians. Will be back when the war is over.\\" Marines also served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War during Henderson's tenure as Commandant. The sword presented to him at the war's end was inscribed, \\"From the Halls of Montezuma, to the Shores of Tripoli\\", giving the opening words to the Marines' hymn. Archibald Henderson died suddenly on 6 January 1859. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery. According to Marine lore, the Colonel Commandant had attempted to will his home ‚Äî actually government-provided quarters in which he had lived for 38 years ‚Äî to his heirs, having forgotten that they were government owned.

He later worked at KFI from 1987 to 1989 but he ultimately resigned, as a protest against fellow KFI personality Tom Leykis, destroying Cat Stevens' (Yusuf Islam) records following Stevens' call for a fatwa on Salman Rushdie. Most recently, Edwards was a morning DJ with KSUR (now KKGO) in Los Angeles. One of the features of his radio show was \\"Radio's Answer Lady,\\" in which listeners could call in with questions ‚Äî some serious, some not so serious ‚Äî and he would answer on the air, sometimes with serious answers, sometimes with quips. During that time, Edwards tried his hand at acting, appearing on I Dream of Jeannie and That Girl. In 1968 he was seen in several episodes of Petticoat Junction, as Bobbie Jo Bradley's boyfriend Jeff. From his time on the show, he met ‚Äî and maintained a very close friendship with ‚Äî Meredith MacRae, (who played Billie Jo Bradley). He also guest starred on Police Woman, Diff'rent Strokes and Small Wonder. In the early 1970s, Edwards appeared on The Bobby Darin Show as the straight man to singer Bobby Darin. After that series ended, Edwards pursued a game show career, starting with Says Who? in 1971, followed by Cop-Out! in February 1972‚Äîhowever, both shows eventually turned out to be unsold pilots. Game shows Edwards' first full-time game show hosting stint took place from March through June 1973 on Jack Barry's Hollywood's Talking, a remake of a late 1960s ABC game Everybody's Talking and the Canadian hit Eye Bet. The program featured contestants watching video clips of celebrities talking about a subject; their job was to guess the subject in question. The series, which aired afternoons on CBS television, did not fare well and the network cancelled it in favor of the phenomenally popular Match Game remake. Edwards also said he did not like Barry and he had no intention of continuing with the series if it made it past CBS' initial commitment. Edwards was not unemployed long, as Chuck Barris hired him to host The New Treasure Hunt that launched in weekly syndication in fall 1973. In January 1974, Edwards returned to daytime with the NBC show Jackpot. For the next nineteen months, ending in September 1975, Edwards would commute back and forth between California and New York as Jackpot taped at NBC's Rockefeller Center studios. He would briefly do this again in 1977 during the run of NBC's Shoot for the Stars (both it and Jackpot were produced by Bob Stewart). The New Treasure Hunt would also come to an end in 1977. In January 1980, Edwards debuted as the host of the new Barry & Enright show Play the Percentages, which he hosted until the end of the television season when it was cancelled. He also hosted his last daytime network show when he substituted for Bill Cullen (then filling in on Password Plus for an ill Allen Ludden) on two weeks of NBC's Chain Reaction, another Bob Stewart show. Edwards also briefly tried his hand at producing when he teamed with Mark Maxwell-Smith to form Smith- Edwards Productions in 1980. The duo signed a deal with Warner Brothers to produce the game show pilot Pot of Gold for NBC, but the series never sold. They also worked on a talk show based on the magazine Ladies Home Journal, but that series also failed to sell and Smith-Edwards Productions folded in 1981. Later that year, Edwards returned to television to host a daily revival of Treasure Hunt for syndication that was cancelled at the end of the 1981‚Äì82 season. In 1983 Edwards began hosting Starcade, a new show centered on video games. He took over the show from previous host Mark Richards, who hosted from December 1982 until the summer of 1983. The show initially aired on Superstation WTBS and went into national syndication from September 1983 to September 1984. Richards was fired for the reasoning that he did not know much or was very enthusiastic about video games; determined not to repeat what his predecessor did, Edwards studied the video games utilized on the show and the industry in general and consequently became so fascinated with video games that he became an avid player. Edwards kept up the hobby until his death. Except for a week of substituting for an ill Monty Hall on Let's Make a Deal in early 1985 and an unsold Bob Stewart pilot for ABC called $50,000 a Minute, Edwards remained largely inactive on the national television scene. This changed with his next two hosting gigs, which were his longest. In November 1985, Edwards replaced Chuck Woolery as the host of the California Lottery's weekly game show The Big Spin, which he would host for ten years, mostly from the lottery's Sacramento headquarters. Then, in 1986, Edwards was called on by Stewart yet again, this time to replace Blake Emmons as host of its Montreal- based revival of Chain Reaction (which aired in the US on the USA Network). He would do this until the series was cancelled in 1991 and would commute between the United States and Canada during this time. During this time, Edwards would also take the job as host of a revival of Jackpot for syndication in 1989. Edwards was also one of four game show hosts to have emceed a game show in the United States and another in Canada concurrently (the other three were Howie Mandel, Alex Trebek and Jim Perry). Edwards, like Perry, commuted back and forth between and Canada between 1986 and 1991, hosting The Big Spin and the 1989 revival of Jackpot! in Sacramento, California and Glendale and the USA Network version of Chain Reaction in Montreal, Quebec. However, Edwards was required to have a Canadian co-host on Chain Reaction, due to the fact that he had no ties to the country, unlike Trebek, Mandel and Perry (Trebek and Mandel are native Canadians; Perry had blood ties to Canada and lived in Toronto, Ontario during the first several years of Definition). His commuting days ended after Chain Reaction left the air in 1991. Edwards was famous for his catch phrase ‚Äî \\"Right you are!\\" ‚Äî which he frequently exclaimed after a correct answer. Other television work Edwards was also co-host of the Los Angeles news program Mid Morning L.A. on KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV), replacing Bob Hilton in the early 1980s and paired with co-host Meredith MacRae. Edwards and MacRae won Emmy Awards for best host and best hostess respectively for a news magazine series. The two also emceed an unsold Bob Stewart-produced game show pilot, $50,000 a Minute, in 1985 for ABC. In 1985, Edwards became host of The Big Spin, the game show of the California Lottery, and would remain host of that program until his retirement from television in 1995. In an interview with Blog Talk Radio, Edwards said he helmed the pilot of Fun & Fortune, the lottery game show in Missouri (before Rick Tamblyn became the permanent host). In another interview, he said he was offered the host role for Family Feud but had to turn it down because he was already committed to Shoot for the Stars. In 1995, Edwards appeared on Sliders, episode \\"Luck of The Draw.\\" Family Edwards and his first wife, Suzanne, co-hosted a talk show, The His and Her of It. The program was broadcast on television stations owned and operated by ABC. In 1970, the couple also served as honorary co-chairmen of the organization California Association of Parents of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children. Later years In his later years, Edwards traveled extensively, hosting traveling programs on both radio and television, and writing about travel. His travel book, Going All The Way humorously chronicles his around the world cruise adventures. He appeared as a guest on GSN Live on May 16, 2008. During his tenure on Starcade, as a result of his extensive studying about video games to avoid what his predecessor did, he became a video game fan; he would often give his own hints to help contestants on the show when they selected a particular game to play, and one \\"Starcade Hotline\\" segment showed him beating the notoriously-difficult arcade game Sinistar (he and other crew members would often play the arcade games between tapings). Death Edwards died of complications from pneumonia at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, on March 5, 2014, less than a month after his 83rd birthday.

Lee-Chin was appointed to the Order of Ontario in 2017. In 2016, Lee-Chin was appointed chairman of the government of Jamaica's Economic Growth Council (EGC) Lee-Chin has made several large pledges and/or donations in Canada to the Royal Ontario Museum in 2003, the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, McMaster University and the Joseph Brant Hospital Foundation. Lee-Chin served as chancellor of Wilfrid Laurier University. Background Lee-Chin was born in Port Antonio, Jamaica, in 1951 to Aston Lee and Hyacinth Gloria Chen. Both his parents were biracial African and Chinese-Jamaican. When Lee-Chin was aged seven, his mother married Vincent Chen. Chen had a son from a previous relationship and the couple had a further seven children together, six boys and one girl. Lee-Chin's mother sold Avon products and worked as a bookkeeper for various local firms, while his stepfather ran a local grocery store. He attended the local high school, Titchfield High, between 1962 and 1969. Career In 1965, Lee-Chin's first job came working as part of the landscaping team at the Frenchman's Cove Hotel. The next year, he got a summer job working on the Jamaica Queen cruise ship, cleaning the engine room. In 1970, he went to Canada on a scholarship program sponsored by the Jamaican government to study Civil Engineering at McMaster University, and graduated in 1974. He financed his first year at university on his own but after that was able to attend on scholarship. After graduating from McMaster, Lee-Chin worked briefly as a road engineer for the Jamaican government, but unable to find work in his qualified field (and allegedly, because his Canadian wife did not like living in Jamaica), he returned to Canada where he began graduate studies in business. At first he worked as a bouncer, but later found employment as a financial advisor for Investors Group. Lee-Chin spent two years at the Investors Group, in the Hamilton, Ontario office and in 1979, moved to Regal Capital Planners and became regional manager. While at the company, in 1983, he secured a loan from the Continental Bank of Canada for C$500,000 to purchase a stake in Mackenzie Financial Group and formed Kicks Athletics with Andrew Gayle. By 1987, the investment was worth C$3.5 million. In 1987, Lee- Chin took the proceeds from his Mackenzie investment to buy a Kitchener-based company called the Advantage Investment Council (a division of AIC Limited) for $200,000. At the time, the company had holdings of around C$800,000. He renamed the company AIC, and developed it to a fund that today controls around C$6 Billion, with hundreds of thousands of investors. Following the acquisition of AIC Limited, Lee-Chin set up the Berkshire group of companies ‚Äì comprising an investment planning arm, a securities dealership and an insurance operation. By 2007, Berkshire amassed more than C$12 billion of assets under administration. In 2007, Manulife acquired Berkshire from Portland Holdings in exchange for shares, making Portland one of the largest shareholders of Manulife. In 2009, Lee-Chin sold AIC Limited to Manulife for an undisclosed amount. The following year, Manulife rebranded the heritage AIC funds and eliminated the AIC name from the mutual fund line-up. In addition to being the founder and Chairman of Portland Holdings Inc., Mr. Lee-Chin is Chairman and Director of Mandeville Holdings Inc. and Executive Chairman, CEO, and Portfolio Manager of Portland Investment Counsel Inc. Investments 1990‚Äì2005 In the late 1980s, AIC suffered from a collapse in the real estate market, in which it had invested. It recovered throughout the early 1990s by maintaining investments in large groups, such as Merrill Lynch and TD bank (formerly Toronto Dominion). This caused investments to grow from US$8 million in 1990 to nearly US$8 billion by 1998. Lee-Chin was reluctant to invest in the dotcom boom, and saw AIC investments lose 8 per cent in value, even as the S&P; gained 56 per cent. Investors moved US$224 million out of AIC's flagship \\"Advantage Mutual Fund\\". The Globe and Mail ran an article predicting even more investors to leave the fund, meaning that they would run out of cash and be forced to sell its core holdings. Lee-Chin's response was to sell stock in Coca-Cola, and invest US$65 million into Mackenzie Holdings (the same firm in which he had invested US$400,000 16 years previously). Letters were sent to all 350,000 investors, explaining the strategy. The investors were calmed by the purchase, and the stock was later sold to Investor Group (the same company Lee-Chin had worked for in the 1980s) at more than twice the price AIC had paid for it. In 2000 and 2001, following the dotcom crash, AIC outperformed the market with 26 per cent growth and 4 per cent decline respectively. In November 2003, AIC was part of a regulatory investigation involving 105 Canadian mutual funds companies. In its review of AIC, investigators found no evidence of late trading and market timing activity by AIC staff. However, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) did find that over the 1999‚Äì2003 period, AIC permitted specific third party investors to engage in market timing trades in AIC Funds that generated profits of $127 million. In the Settlement Agreement between AIC and the OSC, the OSC stated that \\"Accordingly, the conduct of AIC in failing to protect fully the best interests of the Relevant Funds in respect of the frequent trading market timing was contrary to the public interest.\\" As a result, in December 2004, AIC Limited was forced to return CAD $58.8 million to affected investors, which was the largest penalty imposed on any of the fund companies in the OSC investigation. On 5 October 2006, Lee-Chin announced his resignation as CEO of AIC, to be replaced by Jonathan Wellum, AIC's chief investment officer. In 2005, two investment product managers offering structured products joined the Portland Holdings portfolio, Copernican Capital Corporation has offered retail investment products, primarily sold by brokers, and has raised more than C$800 million, in 10 closed end funds since its launch. Markland Street Asset Management, which launched the Oil Sands Sector Fund, raised C$430 million in one of Canada's largest closed-end IPOs. Private life In 1974, he married Vera Lee-Chin, a Ukrainian Canadian whom he had met at university. They parted in 1991, and officially separated (though did not divorce) in 1997. Ms. Lee-Chin has since contested the terms of the separation agreement, claiming that Lee-Chin did not disclose his actual wealth at the time of the separation. The couple had three children, Michael Jr., Paul, and Adrian. Lee-Chin now lives with Sonya Hamilton, with whom he has fraternal-twin daughters, Elizabeth and Maria, near Hamilton, Ontario. Philanthropy In 2003, he made headlines when he pledged to donate $30 million to the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) of which a third had been paid as of 2015. He also provided a $10 million gift to the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. The gift established the Michael Lee- Chin Family Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. The Lee-Chin Institute's purpose is to help current and future business leaders integrate corporate citizenship into business strategy and practices. In September 2014, Lee-Chin and his family donated $10 million to the Joseph Brant Hospital Foundation. Michael Lee-Chin and family received the 2015 Association of Fundraising Professionals' (Golden Horseshoe Chapter) National Philanthropy Award in the category of Outstanding Philanthropist Current fund growth and difficulties=Investment in Caribbean In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Jamaica went through a period of financial crisis. Lee-Chin saw potential in his native country, and Portland purchased 75 per cent of the National Commercial Bank of Jamaica for 6 billion Jamaican dollars (US$127 million) from the Jamaican Government. In 2003, Senvia Money Services Inc., a global money transfer company, was established. This was followed in 2004, by the acquisition of AIC Financial Group Limited, headquartered in Trinidad. In 2004, he announced plans to set up the AIC Caribbean Fund with the intention of investing in the entire Caribbean region. The stated aim of the fund is to raise US$1 billion in order to \\"make investments in businesses located in countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), with an emphasis on Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago\\". So far, it has made a number of large-scale investments. In 2006, Portland acquired an 85 per cent controlling stake in the United General Insurance Company, the largest auto insurer in Jamaica, and renamed the firm Advantage General Insurance Company. A controlling interest in CVM Communications Group (consisting of radio and television stations and newspapers) was purchased at the same time. Portland partnered with the Canadian Risley Group to form Columbus Communications Ltd ‚Äì a Barbadian corporation that holds controlling interest in a number of telecommunications providers in the Caribbean including Cable Bahamas Ltd, Caribbean Crossings Ltd, Merit Communications Ltd, and FibralLink Jamaica Ltd. In the tourism sector, Lee-Chin guided Portland through a number of acquisitions in the Caribbean. Among them were the hospitality operations of the Trident Villas and Spa in Jamaica, Reggae Beach, and Blue Lagoon. Portland's first acquisition in the health care industry sector was announced in July 2006, when Medical Associates Ltd., a privately held hospital in Kingston, Jamaica, joined the Portland Group. Commodities boom Similar to the experience of the late 1990s, Lee-Chin again has shied away from investing in commodities and the energy market boom. He has specifically stated that \\"We [AIC] do not like commodities-type businesses nor most high-tech companies simply because they are implicitly poor enterprises which we would not want to hold for the long term\\". Again, this strategy has meant that AIC has significantly underperformed the S&P; index, but Lee-Chin stated in 2006 that he believed that the current boom is just another bubble. Lee-Chin describes the market since 1990 as \\"a series of rolling speculations\\", and now \\"we see a commodities bubble\\". Business strategy While at Investors Group, he studied the strategies of successful investors, such as Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham and Kenneth Thomson. Their buy and hold strategy is easily recognizable in the motto of AIC ‚Äì Buy, hold and prosper. He also invested in public investment management businesses which benefit from a rising market in two ways. In a rising market stock in portfolios go up and more people become investors and increase existing investment.

In the case of Admiral Gorshkov, this accurately reflects the ship's mission and weapons fit. of the Soviet Navy and the Russian Navy from 1987 to 1996. The ship's original name was Baku when she was commissioned in 1987. Sometimes Admiral Gorshkov is considered a separate class due to her improvements including a phased array radar, extensive electronic warfare installations, and an enlarged command and control suite. She was launched in 1982, and was in service from 1987 to 1991 in the Soviet Navy as Baku, and from 1991 to 1996 in the Russian Navy as Admiral Gorshkov. In 2004, she was sold to India and converted into a STOBAR carrier now named INS Vikramaditya. History The ship was laid down in 1978 at Nikolayev South (Shipyard No.444) in Ukraine, launched in 1982, and commissioned in December 1987. The delay in commissioning was largely caused by software bugs in the new command and control system. The ship was renamed Admiral Gorshkov after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, as the city of Baku was now in independent Azerbaijan. Sergey Gorshkov was responsible for the expansion of the Soviet Navy during the Cold War. In 1994, following a boiler room explosion, the ship was docked for a year of repairs. Although she returned to service in 1995, she was finally withdrawn in 1996 and offered for sale. Bakus deck after it was converted into a STOBAR carrier by the Indian Navy as INS Vikramaditya. On 20 January 2004, Russia agreed to sell Admiral Gorshkov to India after an extensive upgrade at Sevmash Enterprise. In December 2009, it was reported that India had agreed to pay a price of US$2.3 billion. The carrier, now christened INS Vikramaditya, was commissioned into the Indian Navy on 16 November 2013.

The most obvious is the massive passive electronically scanned array above the bridge. This was the phased array antenna for the Mars-Passat (\\"Sky Watch\\") 3D air search radar, comparable to the US SCANFAR radar. Like SCANFAR, Sky Watch proved troublesome and was probably never operational. The biggest change to the weapon systems was the replacement of the SA-N-3 'Goblet' and SA-N-4 'Gecko' SAM launchers with four SA-N-9 'Gauntlet' VLS launchers. This allowed room for another two SS-N-12 'Sandbox' launchers. The two AA guns of the Kievs were replaced with 100 mm guns, and the SUW-N-1 launcher was removed. The air wing was the same as the other Kievs, consisting of a squadron of twelve Yak-38 'Forger' V/STOL aircraft (until they were retired in 1992), twelve Ka-27 'Helix-A' ASW/SAR helicopters and two Ka-31 'Helix' AEW helicopters. Flight operations were assisted by the distinctive new Cake Stand TACAN. Baku was used for trials of the Yak-141 Freestyle supersonic VTOL fighter.

He was the original drummer of the British rock band Feeder. He died by suicide in 2002.  Feeder and early career  Feeder were formed whilst Grant Nicholas was a producer, before moving to London to gain more experience. He had already met Lee in Newport who moved to London afterwards. They formed a band named Raindancer, who despite winning a TV slot on ITV Central never gained a record deal. Shortly before this, Lee was a member of Newport band The Darling Buds, although only appearing on a couple of b-sides of the \\"Sure Thing\\" single. Raindancer's split saw bassist John Canham part ways with the band, before Simon Blight followed soon after when they reformed as Hum, which was changed to Reel, before then changing their name once again to Real when Taka Hirose took over bass duties in 1995. The band signed to The Echo Label in November 1994 before changing their name to Feeder, with their debut single proper \\"Stereoworld\\" reaching number 128 in the UK charts in October 1996, while the second single \\"Tangerine\\" reached number 60. The first full-length album, Polythene, was released in May 1997. Produced by Chris Sheldon, it charted at number 65 in the UK and was certified Silver for sales over 60,000 copies in 2003 when the band had already broken through. Metal Hammer magazine included it in its Top 20 Albums of 1997 list at number 1. It would later in mid 2017, upgrade to Gold status for 100,000 units. The follow-up album, Yesterday Went Too Soon, was produced by Nicholas. Released in August 1999, the album was a much quicker commercial success than its predecessor (entering the UK album chart at number 8 and certified Silver in 2001, with this being upgraded to Gold in 2003). The title track was the band's first UK Top 20 hit. Two years later, the band released their third and also breakthrough album, Echo Park. Produced by Gil Norton (Foo Fighters, The Pixies, Echo & the Bunnymen and James), the album peaked at number 5 in the UK and was also certified Gold, but in its release year, before going Platinum in 2003. It contained their debut Top 10 single \\"Buck Rogers\\". In 2002, when Lee took his own life, the band kept out of the public eye, until the album was nearing its completion. The first play of its lead single \\"Come Back Around\\", was the first time since Lee's death that the band made any public appearances and released new material. The single charted at #14, while the follow-up \\"Just the Way I'm Feeling\\" made the Top 10, both singles appeared on their fourth album Comfort in Sound, also produced by Norton, which although charting one place lower than Echo Park, became their first Platinum seller. The album featured Mark Richardson of Skunk Anansie on drums; he parted company with Feeder in 2009, to return to a reformed Skunk Anansie. An instrumental demo of \\"Come Back Around\\" was recorded before Lee's death, with lyrics written later on by Nicholas. After his death, they were rewritten for the final version which Mark Richardson played on, keeping close to the original instrumental demo recording Lee made with the band.  Death and aftermath  Lee committed suicide by hanging himself with a metal dog chain on 7 January 2002 at his home in Miami, Florida. His death was reported two days later on BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat programme. It was later reported that four suicide notes were found. Lee's funeral took place at St. Mary's Church in Newport on 18 January 2002, where thousands of fans showed up alongside family and friends to pay their own respects. Matt Page, Feeder's manager, read \\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\\", as requested by Lee's father. Feeder's 1997 single \\"High\\" was also played during the ceremony, during which Grant Nicholas gave the following statement: Feeder decided to continue, with Nicholas saying, \\"Jon would have wanted us to carry on.\\" Former Skunk Anansie drummer Mark Richardson helped the band out on drum duties for their album Comfort in Sound and subsequent live performances. The band's first official live appearances after Lee's death was at the Reading/Leeds Festivals, which saw Grant dedicate \\"Quick Fade\\" to \\"absent friends\\". Thousands of fans turned up, with many being forced to watch outside as the tent went over capacity. The South Wales Argus noted the gig as an opportunity for fans to collectively pay their final respects to Lee, while giving their performance a positive review. Kerrang! would later give the band a perfect 5/5 score (KKKKK), for the same performance. Earlier in the year, the band were invited by Melvin Benn, the owner of the festival to headline the first day of the main stage, before turning down the offer as they did not want to play such a high-placed slot so soon after Lee's death, so requested to play a much more low-key slot headlining the second stage. In 2003, frontman Grant Nicholas dedicated the band's win for \\"Best British Band\\" at the Kerrang! Awards to Lee, calling it the award he always wanted the band to win. In 2006, the band released a singles album, entitled The Singles in which Lee features on many of the album's tracks. The album quickly became a platinum seller. Richardson was made the band's permanent member for their fifth studio album Pushing the Senses in 2005. In 2006, an unreleased and incomplete 1998 recording named \\"Uptight\\" was released as a B-side on the \\"Lost and Found\\" single, with Grant Nicholas recording the track's final vocals eight years after the initial 1998 recording. The song features Lee on drums and is to date the last released recording involving him. Richardson left Feeder in 2009 to return to a reformed Skunk Anansie, before Karl Brazil took over the drums. Nicholas later claimed that the chemistry he feels between himself and Brazil is very much the same way that he felt with Lee. Feeder's 2012 album Generation Freakshow features the track \\"Hey Johnny\\" which is written in dedication to Lee. In 2017, Lee would make a posthumous return to the top 10 of the UK Albums Chart, when The Best of Feeder charted at number 10 in October of that year. As a past member of Feeder, Lee was posthumously inducted into the Kerrang! Radio Hall of Fame on the 9 August 2019, for \\"Distinguished Services to Rock\\".

The song has English language verses and an Irish language chorus, a style known as macaronic. The title () translates to \\"go, my love\\" (or variants): si√∫il is an imperative, literally translating to \\"walk!\\", a r√∫n is a term of endearment. History The history of the song is unclear. It has been suggested that the song refers to the \\"Wild Geese\\" of the Glorious Revolution. If it does, however, the original version has probably been lost. It is not uncommon that Irish songs were translated into English, with their chorus surviving in Irish, or being transformed into nonsense words (see Caleno custure me), but in most of these cases, some of the Irish version still survives. It is possible that the song was composed in the 1800s with the conscious intention of styling it after older songs. As is common in folk music, many lyrical variants of the song exist. Robert Louis Stevenson refers to the song twice in his novel The Master of Ballantrae (1889). Referred to as \\"the pathetic air of 'Shule Aroon'\\", it is whistled by the Irish Jacobite exile Francis Burke and later sung by the Master of Ballantrae himself to impress his younger brother's wife. The Master describes it as \\"very moving\\" and describes it being sung by Jacobite exiles in France: \\"it is a pathetic sight when a score of rough Irish ... get to this song; and you may see, by their falling tears, how it strikes home to them\\". Stevenson, Robert Louis, The Master of Ballantrae (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), pp. 73, 95. In Ulysses, James Joyce had Stephen Dedalus sing the song to Leopold Bloom in Bloom's kitchen (as part of the Ithaca episode). The song can be seen to signal or echo many of the grand themes of the book, referencing loss of language, usurpation, betrayal, loss of leadership and women selling themselves. Bloom responds by singing a song in Hebrew.Joyce, James, Ulysses (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1968), p. 608 \\"Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier\\"/\\"Buttermilk Hill\\" is a well-known American variant dating to the Revolutionary War, sharing a common melody and similar lyrics. Modern performance Legendary folklorist and ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax recorded Elizabeth Cronin singing Si√∫il a R√∫n (\\"Shule Agra\\") in the early 1950s, and both the lyrics and the tune of her version are seemingly the foundation of most subsequent recordings, including those of Clannad and Celtic Women. \\"Si√∫il a R√∫n\\" is one of the most widely sung songs in the Irish repertoire. Well-known performances are by Clannad from their album D√∫lam√°n and Mary Black on different occasions, e.g. on the BBC's \\"The Highland Sessions\\" or with Altan on \\"Altan Beo ‚Äì 21 Bliain ag Ceol\\". Recordings include Nita Conley Korn and Eileen Estes on their album \\"The Apple Tree Project,\\" Scantily Plaid on their album, \\"Just Checking In\\", √âdain on \\"JOYceFUL\\", √âil√≠s Kennedy on \\"One Sweet Kiss\\", Tr√≠ona N√≠ Dhomhnaill on Donal Lunny's Coolfin, Allison Barber on \\"Traveling Home\\", √ìrla Fallon from Celtic Woman on the album of the same name, Lisa Kelly (who was also with Celtic Woman) on \\"Lisa\\", Ci√∫nas on \\"Celtic Tiger\\", Aoife N√≠ Fhearraigh on \\"If I Told You\\", Maighr√©ad N√≠ Dhomhnaill & Iarla √ì Lion√°ird on \\"Sult\\", An√∫na on \\"Invocation\\" with Lucy Champion, Connie Dover on \\"The Wishing Well\\", Akelarre Agrocelta on \\"La Amenaza Celta\\", Nora Butler on Geantra√≠ and Siobhan Owen on \\"Purely Celtic\\". The song has also been recorded by Kate Price, Lintie, Acabella, Anam, The Irish Group, Caoilte √ì S√∫illeabh√°in, Nollaig Casey, Kate Crossan, Carmel Gunning, Rosheen, Sissel Kyrkjebo with the Chieftains, Sarah English, Janette Geri, and Bruadar. \\"Si√∫il a R√∫in\\" is one of the songs in Flatley's Lord of the Dance. Versions of \\"Buttermilk Hill\\" have been performed by The Black Country Three, Dan Gibson, Alisa Jones, Julie Felix, Judy Collins, Noah Saterstrom and The Weavers. A recognisable version of this song was recorded by Peter, Paul, and Mary entitled Gone The Rainbow. It was on the B-side of The Hammer Song (If I had a hammer). The song is sung by Aisling Franciosi's character Clare, in the movie \\"The Nightingale\\" by Jennifer Kent.

He then went on, as Tom Angelripper, to be the founding members of the German thrash metal band Sodom. He originally started off as just the bassist, but ended up becoming the vocalist and has done both on every studio release.

Angelripper also founded a band called Onkel Tom Angelripper which plays metal versions of schlagers, drinking songs and Christmas carols. In addition, he worked with a side project of Sodom's touring guitarist Alex Kraft, called Desperados, which played spaghetti Western-themed heavy metal. The band later evolved independently under the name of Dezperadoz, but Angelripper still occasionally contributes.

The plants are found throughout neotropical and subtropical Africa. It was named after John Ansell, an English assistant botanist. who found the first specimens in 1841 on the Fernando Po Island in West Africa. This genus is sometimes abbreviated as Ansel or Aslla in horticultural trade. It is referred to along with Grammatophyllum as a \\"trash basket\\" orchid due to its habit of creating a makeshift container of aerial roots to catch falling leaf litter for nutrients.The Orchids, Natural History and Classification, Robert L. Dressler.  Distribution and habitat  This orchid is native to tropical and southern Africa,Ansellia africana in World Checklist of Orchidaceae. Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew found alongside coasts and rivers in the canopy of trees, usually at elevations lower than 700 m (occasionally up to 2,200 m).  Description  This is a large, perennial, and epiphyte, or at times a terrestrial plant, growing in sometimes spectacular clumps, attached to the branches of tall trees. The white, needle-like, aerial roots are characteristic for this orchid. They point upwards, taking the form of a basket around the tall, many- noded, fusiform, canelike, yellow pseudobulbs, catching the decaying leaves and detritus upon which the plant feeds. These pseudobulbs can develop a gigantic size, up to 60 cm long. This robust orchid can grow very large, sometimes with an estimated weight over a tonne. Even eagle owls (Bubo bubo) have been seen to make their nest in such a clump. The roots which penetrate the substrate can become very thick and cord-like to support the weight of the plants, and are typically very different in form than the roots which comprise the trash basket as the aerial roots are non-absorbing. Breakdown and absorption of nutrients by the plant from the trash basket is performed by its fungal symbionts and the active absorbing roots. These pseudobulbs carry on their top 6 to 7, narrowly ligulate-lanceolate, acute, plicate, leathery leaves. They give rise to a paniculate inflorescence, up to 85 cm long, with many (10 to 100), delicately scented flowers, 6 cm across. The three-lobed lip grows into three yellow projections. The tepals are yellow or greenish yellow, lightly or heavily marked with brown spots. The flowers are short-lived, seldom lasting longer than 10 days, but are produced in abundance provided the plants have received high light levels throughout the year.  Cultivation  An easy species to grow, in cultivation the plants usually bloom with a terminal inflorescence from the older pseudobulbs, some plants however, will produce flowers from newer pseudobulbs in odd years. These plants are shy to flower in cultivation unless they receive very bright light of around 2000 foot candles and given a dry rest for about 6 weeks in the fall. In habitat, the plants can go periods of several months without water, and are very drought tolerant, but the plants tend to perform better if kept evenly moist throughout the year. Plants which are receiving enough light will take on a yellowish coloration in the leaves. This is normal as these plants use CAM photosynthesis. Plants with very green leaves are not receiving enough light. The plants are fungal magnets in habitat and in cultivation and tend to culture mychorrhizal fungi they pick up from their environment since this species is a trash basket orchid that in nature creates a network of interlocked airborne roots to collect leaf litter, they have a tendency to rapidly break down their growing medium more so than other species of orchids. Unlike most epiphytic orchids, the roots of this species are not appreciably photosynthetic, are white and pale, and resemble the roots of terrestrial and mycoheterotrophic orchids. When the plants are not getting enough nitrogen, they will start growing a trash basket with numerous non-absorbing roots growing upwards. These plants do not produce a trash basket if they are receiving sufficient nitrogen regularly. These plants in habitat usually bloom at the end of dry spells, however, this species has a unique habit of blooming at any time of the year and several times a year if the plants have been grown in high light levels and are subjected to short dry spells of 4‚Äì6 weeks every 6 months. There is wide variability of flower shape, color, and markings, and this species is widespread across Africa.  Gallery  File:Ansellia africana.jpgIllustration of Ansellia africana from B.S.

It first aired on October 16, 2002 on the UPN network within the United States. The episode was written by executive producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, and directed by David Straiton. Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, after visiting the planet Kreetassa, Captain Archer's (Scott Bakula) dog Porthos falls ill with an unknown pathogen. Archer stays overnight in sickbay to look after his dog with Doctor Phlox (John Billingsley) knowing that afterwards he must take part in an elaborate apology display to the Kreetassans. The episode featured Vaughn Armstrong, who reprised his role of the Kreetassan Captain from the episode \\"Vox Sola\\". Several scenes also proved challenging for the main dog actor who portrayed Porthos, who was named Breezy. She was required to lie still for long periods, jump into Bakula's arms on command and also act on her own whilst her trainer was not on set. Berman compared the relationship between Archer and Phlox to The Odd Couple, saying that the episode was \\"a lot of fun\\". The episode was nominated for the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (short form) and received the highest Nielsen ratings for any episode of Enterprise during season two at that point. However, the critical reception was mixed. Plot After a five-day away mission spent apologising on the planet Kreetassa, the away team consisting of Captain Archer, Sub- Commander T'Pol, Ensign Sato, and Archer's dog, Porthos, return to the ship to decontaminate. Porthos has acquired a pathogen on the planet surface and must be quarantined. Archer learns from Commander Tucker of the ship's need for an extra plasma injector from the Kreetassans, but negotiations break down after it is discovered that Porthos had urinated on a sacred tree, insulting the Kreetassans. Archer reacts poorly to the news and is given a list of requirements he must meet in order to apologise. He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer spends the night in Sickbay to be with his pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer experiences Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, and how he was the last in a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol. T'Pol, working out in the gym, also keeps urging Archer to apologize to the Kreetassans for Porthos' behavior, but Archer resists because he blames them for Porthos' illness. In the end, Porthos recovers following a pituitary transplant from an alien chameleon. Finally swallowing his pride, Archer then goes down to the Kreetassan capital and delivers an intricate ritual apology which involves slicing a tree trunk with a chainsaw, arranging the pieces of wood in a complex pattern on the ground, and chanting phrases in the Kreetassan language. Having successfully apologised to the Kreetassans, the crew finally manage to procure three plasma injectors prior to their departure. Production Executive producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga had worked together to write a series of episodes for Star Trek: Enterprise, with \\"A Night in Sickbay\\" amongst them. Berman originally described the episode at a press junket when talking about season two at an event held by UPN for the Television Critics Association. He said it was a \\"very humorous episode that has our good captain going and spending some time in sickbay, because his dog gets sick. He moves into sickbay the same way a mother will move into the hospital when her child gets sick, and it ends up being an 'Odd Couple' kind of an episode between the captain and Dr. Phlox. It's a lot of fun.\\" Bakula also explained in an interview with the website TrekWeb that the episode featured Archer's dog Porthos as a background character and that it was also about Archer spending a night in sickbay with Phlox. He said that this meant that the viewer will \\"find out a lot of stuff about [Phlox] that we may not have wanted to know; like what he does when he's in his off hours... he has things to cut and trim!\\" Billingsley said later that he enjoyed working with Bakula on this episode and called \\"A Night in Sickbay\\" one of his favourites. The episode was directed by David Straiton, who had previously directed \\"Desert Crossing\\". The shoot took six and a half days, which concluded on August 8, 2002. \\"A Night in Sickbay\\" was intended to be a low- cost episode as the majority of scenes required only the use of the standing sets for the series. The only credited guest star in \\"A Night in Sickbay\\" was Vaughn Armstrong, who played the Kreetassan Captain once again. Armstrong is better known for his recurring role in Enterprise as Admiral Maxwell Forrest, but had previously played the Kreetassan Captain in the first season episode \\"Vox Sola\\". In order to appear as the Captain, some three and a half hours of make-up time was required, with the actor needed to arrive to have his make-up applied at 5:30am for his one day of shooting. Armstrong appeared in a variety of different roles in several different Star Trek programs, dating back to the Star Trek: The Next Generation season one episode \\"Heart of Glory\\". Other make-up effects during this instalment of Enterprise included a pair of prosthetic feet for Dr. Phlox, although other effects for the character were added in post-production. Porthos Porthos was played by more than one Beagle (example of a Beagle pictured), and was also represented by a prop dog for some scenes. There were two Beagles portraying Porthos, who were supplied by Performing Animal Troupe, an animal supply company for film and television. These dogs included a female Beagle called Breezy, who was the main dog actor who played Porthos during season two. Breezy was the original double for male dog actor Prada who appeared in the first-season episodes of Enterprise up until \\"Two Days and Two Nights\\", when Breezy became the main dog. She had also previously appeared as Lou in the 2001 film Cats & Dogs. More than one scene proved problematic for Breezy during the filming of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally he would have been behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that \\"By the time we went into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms.\\" In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face. A further challenge for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times a stunt dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A Beagle prop was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series Carniv√†le and the film The Chronicles of Riddick. Reception and home media release \\"A Night in Sickbay\\" was first aired in the United States on the UPN network on October 16, 2002. It received Nielsen ratings of a 3.9/6 percentage share among all adults, including 6 percent of all adults watching television at the time of the broadcast. Although overnight figures had shown a slight decrease from the previous episode, the final numbers showed that the ratings were the highest seen so far during season two and the third week of increased ratings for Enterprise in succession. This meant that 6.26 million viewers watched the episode, an increase of 860,000 viewers from the previous week's episode, making it the highest viewed episode since season one's \\"Sleeping Dogs\\". Alexander Chase at USA Today said the numbers \\"confirm a ratings turnaround for the newest Trek series\\". The episode placed Enterprise fourth in a list of the most highly rated science fiction/fantasy shows on television for that week, behind Alias, Smallville, and John Doe. The review by \\"Herc\\" for the website Ain't It Cool News, praised the story about how Porthos was named and the elements of sexual tension between Archer and T'Pol. However, he didn't think the Odd Couple type relationship between Archer and Phlox worked all the time with some misfires amongst the comedic elements. He gave the episode a rating of three out of five, describing it as \\"actually worth your valuable time\\". Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for TrekNation, saying that she enjoyed the episode on the whole and enjoyed the characterisation. However, she criticised the non-moving Beagle prop as it made her son think the dog was dead, which was then followed by \\"what looks like a drowned dog in formaldehyde\\". Jamahl Epsicokhan reviewed the episode for his website \\"Jammer's Reviews\\", giving it a score of one out of four. He called it \\"easily the dumbest concept for an episode of Star Trek since Voyager holodeck was hijacked by the residents of Fair Haven\\". He felt that the episode made a mockery out of the characters and that some of the situations they were placed in were just ridiculous. The episode was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (short form) at the 2003 awards alongside \\"Carbon Creek\\" and episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly. The award went to the Buffy episode \\"Conversations with Dead People\\". In 2016, SyFy included this episode in a group of Star Trek franchise episodes they felt were commonly disliked but \\"deserved a second chance\\". In 2017, Screen Rant ranked \\"A Night in Sickbay\\" the 14th worst Star Trek episode highlighting what they felt were poor character development choices and a weak plot that revolved around a sick dog (Porthos) that peed on a tree. WhatCulture ranked this episode the 17th worst episode of Star Trek. The first home media release of \\"A Night in Sickbay\\" was part of the season two DVD box set, released in the United States on August 7, 2005. The release featured deleted scenes from the episode as well as a special feature on the episode entitled \\"Inside A Night in Sickbay\\". A release on Blu-ray Disc for season two occurred on August 20, 2013.

Final assembly for all F-units was at the GM-EMD plant at La Grange, Illinois, and the GMDD plant in London, Ontario, Canada. They were sold to railroads throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and a few were exported to Saudi Arabia. The term F-unit refers to the model numbers given to each successive type (i.e. F3, F7, etc.), all of which began with the letter F. The \\"F\\" originally meant Fourteen, as in 1,400 horsepower, not F as in Freight. Longer EMD E-units for passenger service had twin 900 horsepower diesel engines (called \\"prime movers\\" in this type of application). The \\"E\\" meant Eighteen as in 1,800 horsepower. Similarly, for early model EMD switchers \\"S\\" meant Six hundred and \\"N\\" meant Nine hundred horsepower. F-units were originally designed for freight service ‚Äì although many without steam generators (for steam-heating passenger cars) pulled short-distance, mainly daytime passenger trains. Some carriers even equipped small numbers of their Fs with steam generators for long-haul passenger service. On the other hand, Santa Fe maintained a large fleet of fully equipped, high-speed F3s and F7s in \\"warbonnet\\" paint schemes built exclusively for top-tier passenger trains, such as the \\"Chief\\", \\"Super Chief\\", and \\"El Capitan\\". Almost all F-units were B-B locomotives, meaning that they ran on two Blomberg B two-axle trucks with all axles powered. The prime mover in F-units was a sixteen-cylinder EMD 567 series mechanically aspirated two-stroke diesel engine, progressing from model 16-567 through 16-567D. Structurally, the locomotive was a carbody unit, with the body as the main load-bearing structure, designed like a bridge truss and covered with cosmetic panels. The so-called bulldog nose was a distinguishing feature of the locomotive's appearance, and made a lasting impression in the mind of the traveling public. The F-units were the most successful \\"first generation\\" road (main line) diesel locomotives in North America, and were largely responsible for superseding steam locomotives in road freight service. Before this, diesel units were mostly only built as switcher locomotives, and only used in rail yards. F-units were sometimes known as \\"covered wagons\\",See, e. g., Young, William S. \\"Covered Wagons: The Early Road Diesels of the Erie Lackawanna\\" (1976, Starrucca Valley Publications). due to the similarity in appearance of the roof of an F-unit to the canvas roof of a Conestoga wagon, an animal-drawn wagon used in the westward expansion of the United States during the late 18th and 19th centuries. When a train's locomotive included only F-units, the train would then be called a wagon train. These two usages are still popular with the railfan community.

The F3 (1946) had a different roof arrangement that included the replacement of the FT's boxy dynamic brake structure with two under-roof grids, two exhaust stacks instead of four, and four cooling fans grouped together instead of separated pairs of cooling fans. The F3 was also two feet longer than the FT to allow a standard draft gear to be installed at the rear of the unit. The 567B engine was uprated to . Some F3s were nicknamed \\"chickenwire\\" for the type of engine room air-intake structure along the sides. The F7 (1949) and F9 (1954) were evolutionary: the F7 had improved traction motors, the F9 a 567C engine. A louver arrangement over the vents changed their appearance from the F3. There were also 4 foot longer versions, the FP7 and FP9, with the extra length to house a tank for extra water capacity. Only one F model did not have Blomberg B trucks: the FL9 had a lightweight Flexicoil B in front and a standard passenger A-1-A at the rear. Model descriptions are as built; EMC/EMD locomotives are often rebuilt to newer standards. In the May 2014 issue of Trains Magazine at page 10 is an article by Chris Guss concerning freight and current use of the EMD F Unit. Engine and powertrain The F series used a 16-cylinder version of the 567 series diesel engine, introduced in 1939. The 567 was designed specifically for railroad locomotives, a mechanically aspirated 2 stroke 45 degree V type with displacement per cylinder, for a total of . An ongoing engine improvement program saw the FT‚Äôs original up-rated to in the FL9 by the end of F unit production. A DC generator powered four traction motors, two on each truck. The Blomberg B truck first used in the FT became the EMD production standard, being used through 1995. EMC/EMD has built all of its major components since 1939 Passenger service Amtrak #113, an EMD FP7, leading two EMD SDP40Fs with the San Francisco Zephyr at the Yuba Gap, 1975. While the F-unit series was originally conceived for freight service, many were used to haul passenger trains. The original EMC FT demonstrator was equipped with a steam generator in the B units for train heating. Several railroads took advantage of the large space in the rear of their B units to add steam generators. The first FTs built strictly as a passenger unit was the Santa Fe 167 four unit set in February 1945. Learning from this, EMD offered an optional steam generator on all later F unit models. This was mounted at the rear of the carbody; steam- generator equipped locomotives can be recognised by the exhaust stack and safety valves protruding at the rear of the roof. The F units were popular passenger locomotives on mountain grades (where they were recommended by EMD), because a four-unit set had more motored axles than a trio of E-units of equivalent power (sixteen versus twelve) and thus had less chance of overloading the traction motors. Additionally, that 4-unit F set had all its weight on driven wheels and was thereby capable of greater tractive effort. The AT&SF; Super Chief, CB&Q;/D&RGW;/WP California Zephyr, and GN Empire Builder all used F units on their Chicago-West Coast routes in the 1950s. The F7 was also popular for commuter lines and other passenger service where the trains were short. Options There were several options that could be specified by customers, such as type and mounting location of horns, bells, and the like. Dynamic brakes Dynamic brakes were an option on F units ordered by railroads with mountainous terrain and steep grades. Passenger or freight pilot Either a passenger or freight style pilot could be ordered. The passenger pilot, similar to that standard on EMD E units, sloped smoothly down from the bottom of the nose, making a single slope all the way down from the headlight. The coupler was retractable with concealing doors. The result was a very attractive appearance that enhanced the impression of a powerful and speedy machine. The freight pilot curved inward a little way below the bottom of the nose before sloping out again, to give more clearance to the coupler and hoses. The coupler was fixed and protruded through a rectangular opening in the pilot. See also * CF7 - A rebuild of an EMD F unit by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.

She was created by series producer Russell T Davies and portrayed by Billie Piper. With the revival of Doctor Who in 2005, Rose was introduced as a new travelling companion of the series protagonist, the Doctor, in his ninth and tenth incarnations. The companion character, intended to act as an audience surrogate, was key in the first series to introduce new viewers to the mythos of Doctor Who, which had not aired regularly since 1989. Rose became the viewers' eyes into the new world of Doctor Who, from the companion's perspective. Piper received top billing alongside Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant for the duration of her time as a regular cast member. A regular for all of series one (2005) and series two (2006), Piper later returned for three episodes of the programme's fourth series (2008) and appeared in feature-length specials in both 2010 and 2013. In 2013, Piper played a different character for the 50th anniversary known as 'The Moment', projecting Rose's image in her 'Bad Wolf' form. In the series' narrative, Rose is introduced in the eponymous series one premiere as a teenage working class shop assistant from London, alongside her own supporting cast in the form of her mother Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri) and her boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke). Over the course of the first series Rose's human actions and responses contrast with the Doctor's alien perspectives. Rose grows increasingly trusting of the Doctor and comes to realise she has fallen in love with him. He comes to value and depend on her and sacrifices his Ninth incarnation for her. Rose forms a similar bond with the new Doctor, but the two appear to be forever separated in the series two finale, although Rose's temporary return in the fourth series gives her relationship with the Doctor a resolution. In promoting the series, both Piper and Eccleston stressed Rose's heroic characteristics whilst Davies highlighted her down-to-earth qualities and quintessential \\"British-ness\\". Critical reaction noted that the character was more developed, independent and equal to the Doctor than previous companions had been, whilst the character's overall role in the narrative of the first two series was praised. However, reaction to the character's 2008 return was more mixed. Piper won numerous awards for her portrayal of Rose ‚Äîincluding two National Television Awards ‚Äîand since her initial role in the series, the character has ranked highly in numerous 'best companion' polls. After leaving as a series regular, Piper experienced success in other high- profile roles as an actress which has been partly attributed to her performances in Doctor Who. Appearances=Television Rose is introduced in the eponymous premiere episode, \\"Rose\\", of the 2005 series. She is saved from an Auton attack by the mysterious Time Lord the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), and assists him in preventing an invasion of Earth. Subsequently, the Doctor invites Rose to be his travelling companion, taking her to the end of the world and tampering her mobile so she can remain in contact with her mother Jackie (Camille Coduri), and boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) while time-travelling in \\"The End of the World\\". In their travels through time and space, Rose learns the importance of not tampering with history, when in \\"Father's Day\\", she attempts to save the life of her father Pete Tyler (Shaun Dingwall), who had died when she was a baby. Throughout their journeys, she and the Doctor are haunted by two mysterious recurring words: \\"Bad Wolf\\". Rose, the Doctor, and new companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) come to understand the meaning of this phrase in \\"Bad Wolf\\", when they encounter an unstoppable army of Daleks on the space station Satellite 5, which first appeared in \\"The Long Game\\". To return to the Doctor after he sends her home to Earth in series finale \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", Rose tears open the console of the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, and becomes suffused with the power of the time vortex. Returning, she uses her power over the infinity of time and space to spread the words \\"Bad Wolf\\" over its entirety, then saving the universe from the Dalek invasion. Rose resurrects Jack, who died from Dalek fire, and destroys the Dalek fleet before the Doctor drains the energy out of her to save her life from its harmful effects. Rose is horrified as the Doctor appears to die and regenerates into a new man (David Tennant), who proceeds to take the TARDIS and a terrified Rose to Earth, abandoning Jack on Satellite 5. The new Doctor and Rose arrive on Earth on Christmas Day, where he passes out from the strain of regeneration in the midst of a Sycorax invasion in the 2005 Christmas special \\"The Christmas Invasion\\". Having woken up and saved Earth, the Doctor enjoys Christmas dinner with Rose before they travel to parts unknown. Over the second series (2006), Rose and the Doctor grow increasingly close to one another. After defeating a werewolf in \\"Tooth and Claw\\", they are knighted by Queen Victoria (Pauline Collins), who banishes them as potential threats to the Empire whilst setting up the Torchwood Institute, which aims to track alien activity on Earth, including the Doctor's. Their relationship proves a source of tension once Mickey joins the pair in their travels, at the suggestion of the Doctor's former companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) in \\"School Reunion\\". Whilst stranded in a parallel universe in \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\", Rose meets a rich, entrepreneur version of her father Pete who never died. Mickey decides to stay behind on this world to battle Cybermen as he no longer wants to feel like a spare part at the end of \\"The Age of Steel\\". Alone with the Doctor again, Rose faces the Beast (Gabriel Woolf) in the two-part story \\"The Impossible Planet\\" and \\"The Satan Pit\\", who prophesies that Rose will soon die in battle. This day comes when, in \\"Army of Ghosts\\", the Torchwood Institute's director Yvonne Hartman (Tracy-Ann Oberman) unintentionally allows the Cybermen army and Dalek Cult of Skaro into Rose's reality, where they begin a war. In the series finale \\"Doomsday\\", when sealing the Cybermen and Daleks back into the void through which they came, Rose is transported to the parallel universe by Pete, to save her from also being pulled into the void. Rose becomes trapped in the parallel universe with Jackie and the alternate universe Pete as the walls between universes seal; she is later declared dead in her own universe. Months later, the Doctor is able to transmit Rose a goodbye message. She reveals she now works for that universe's Torchwood, and confesses her love for him. Before he can reply, their connection is lost. In spin-off series Torchwood (2006‚Äì2011), the audience learns that Rose's act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with being unable to die. Her absence and the Doctor's pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor's series 3 (2007) companion Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show's fourth series (2008) during \\"Partners in Crime\\", Rose mysteriously begins to appear in the Doctor's life‚Äîfirst seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor is oblivious to. In \\"Turn Left\\", when a \\"Time Beetle\\" creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna's younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to the Doctor; \\"Bad Wolf\\". The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the universe, and reality itself is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie, and his part-human counterpart. Rose challenges the Doctor to say the words he did not say to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but his part-human counterpart whispers in her ear and Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind with his part-human counterpart. In the closing scenes of \\"The End of Time\\" (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose's housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. He speaks to her from the shadows, asking her what year it is. She tells him it is January 1, 2005. The Doctor promises her that she will have a really great year. Piper returned for the show's 50th anniversary episode \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013) as the interface of a sentient weapon of mass destruction known as 'the Moment'. The War Doctor (John Hurt) intends to end the raging Time War by using the Moment to destroy both the Daleks and the Time Lords. Using Rose's image, chosen for her future significance to the Doctor, the Moment attempts to persuade him to seek an alternative course of action by showing him how the decision will affect his future. Literature Rose is featured in the first twelve Doctor Who New Series Adventures novels, which expand on her characterisation. The first three of these novels‚ÄîThe Clockwise Man, The Monsters Inside and Winner Takes All‚Äîwere published in May 2005 and feature solely the Ninth Doctor and Rose. The Monsters Inside depicts Rose's first visit to an alien planet, her travels previously having been confined to earth and orbiting space stations. Rose mentions this visit to the planet Justicia in the first series television episode \\"Boom Town\\" which aired 4 June 2005. The second batch of Ninth Doctor novels ‚Äîcomprising The Deviant Strain, Only Human and The Stealers of Dreams‚Äîwere released in September 2005 and expand on the Doctor and Rose's travels with Jack Harkness. The novel Only Human mentions that Rose was engaged to a previous love interest before becoming involved with Mickey. The events of \\"Boom Town\\" are addressed in The Stealers of Dreams in which Jackie complains that Rose did not alert her to her recent visit to modern day Cardiff. The first three novels to feature Rose and the Tenth Doctor‚ÄîThe Stone Rose, The Feast of the Drowned and The Resurrection Casket‚Äîwere released in April 2006 to coincide with the broadcast of the second television series. The Feast of the Drowned explores the context of Rose's shifting relationship with Jackie and Mickey in light of her frequent absences from earth. Her relationship with a school friend, Keisha, is also explored; Rose is irritated to find out she and Mickey have become involved in her absence. The last three New Series Adventures novels to feature Rose ‚ÄîThe Nightmare of Black Island, The Art of Destruction and The Price of Paradise‚Äîwere published in September 2006. In addition to the regular range of novels, Rose is featured in the first Doctor Who Quick Reads Initiative novella, I am a Dalek in which she and the Doctor must deal with a human-Dalek hybrid. The Doctor Who Annual 2006, published in August 2005, gives further biographical information on Rose in an article written by the programme's chief writer and executive producer Russell T Davies, including the middle name \\"Marion\\", and information about her mother, school life and ex- boyfriends. The character also appears in short stories featured in the Doctor Who annuals for 2006 and 2007, in addition to an issue of the series' sanctioned companion magazine, Doctor Who Magazine. She has additionally been featured in comic book sequences which feature in the annuals, Doctor Who Magazine, and children's magazines Doctor Who Adventures and Doctor Who ‚Äì Battles in Time. In one Doctor Who Magazine comic strip, \\"The Green-Eyed Monster\\", Rose is possessed by a creature that feeds on jealousy. In order to arouse enough jealousy to defeat this creature the Tenth Doctor feigns a romance with Rose's mother and sets up Mickey with a group of actors who pose as beautiful amazonian girlfriends. The character also appears in a panel of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight's second story, \\"No Future for You\\". Audio drama Following the folding of AudioGO and Big Finish's acquisition of the new series license, Piper reprised her role as Rose in Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Adventures released in November 2017, with David Tennant reprising his role as the Tenth Doctor. The stories include Infamy of the Zaross, Sword of the Chevalier and Cold Vengeance. Piper returned again for Rose Tyler: The Dimension Cannon, a series featuring Rose as the main character travelling through parallel worlds in search of the Doctor. Development=Casting 2005‚Äì10 executive producer Russell T Davies (pictured) deliberately recycled the names \\"Rose\\" and \\"Tyler\\" from names he had used in previous works. Lead writer and executive producer Russell T Davies chose the name Rose because he considered it a \\"good luck charm\\" after he used it for Lesley Sharp's character in Bob & Rose. His desire to make the show \\"essentially British\\" was another justification: he considered Rose to be \\"the most British name in the world\\" and feminine enough to subvert a recent trend of female companions having \\"boyish\\" names, such as Peri, Benny, Charley, and Ace. Davies also frequently uses the surname \\"Tyler\\" in his work ‚Äîprevious characters he created with the surname include Ruth Tyler in Revelations (1994), Vince Tyler in Queer as Folk (1999), and Johnny Tyler in The Second Coming (2003) ‚Äîdue to his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced. Davies also used the surname \\"Tyler\\" in his Doctor Who New Adventures book \\"Damaged Goods\\". The casting of Piper as Rose was announced on by the BBC on 24 May 2004. Head of Drama for BBC Wales Julie Gardner commented that the former pop star \\"fits the bill perfectly\\" as a \\"unique, dynamic partner for Christopher Eccleston\\". Whilst some fans ‚Äîincluding a representative of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society ‚Äîwere enthusiastic about the announcement, others felt it was \\"publicity stunt\\" casting and questioned Piper's acting credentials. One of the factors that influenced Piper's acceptance of the role was that she was able to relate the character of Rose to her own experiences as a teenager. The British media had regularly released conflicting reports about how long Piper would be staying with the programme. In March 2006, she claimed that she would continue on Doctor Who into its third series in 2007. The BBC announced on 15 June 2006 that Piper was to depart in the final episode of the second series, \\"Doomsday\\". Piper's decision to leave had been taken a year previously but remained a secret until news of her departure became public. Following \\"Doomsday\\", Piper as Rose was greenlit to be the star of the spin-off series Rose Tyler: Earth Defence, set in her parallel universe and to air as a bank holiday special, but Davies deemed the concept \\"a spin-off too far\\" after Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures. Piper's eventual return during series four was planned during filming of the second series; in January 2006, she made a pact promising to return to film several more episodes. Davies and Piper cited her commitment to other projects‚Äîspecifically, her roles as Belle de Jour in Secret Diary of a Call Girl, the lead character in the BBC adaptations of Philip Pullman's Sally Lockhart quartet, and Fanny Price in the ITV adaptation of Mansfield Park‚Äîas explanations behind her departure appearing permanent. Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat praised the creation and casting of the character in advance of the series' 50th anniversary in 2013. He stated that the character of Rose helped secure the return of the show by allowing \\"an audience who would not naturally have watched Doctor Who\\" to become invested in the show. Moffat suggested that during the first two years of the revival Doctor Who \\"was Billie Piper‚Äôs show\\" and that this has given her an \\"iconic status\\" above other Doctor Who companions. Characterisation Rose is used by Davies as an introduction to the shows mythos and fantasy elements. He later underlined similarities between Rose and Gwen Cooper ‚Äîthe lead for Torchwood ‚Äî describing both as \\"the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal.\\" Like her successor Martha, Rose is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia makes the assumption that this is because characters from the capital of the country are \\"relatable to all British people\\" because they are seen as \\"neutral\\". Rose is introduced alongside a supporting cast in the form of her boyfriend Mickey and mother Jackie which James Chapman cites as \\"evidence of Davies' attempt to create a social context for the companion\\". Davies states that the inclusion of these two characters was part of his desire to \\"make her real\\" and to \\"give her a life\\". He later stated that in giving Rose a mother, a boyfriend and a \\"sad story with her father\\" the character has \\"her own mythology, to match the Doctor.\\" Lindy A. Orthia observes that Rose, like the other companions in Davies' era of Doctor Who, is \\"drawn from a cosmopolitan vision\\" in her case because of her class background. Orthia contends that whilst working-class companions had featured previously in the show \\"none were unskilled workers nor chronically under- or unemployed like Rose, Jackie and Donna\\". Looking back at the two characters, Davies felt Jackie to be someone who is \\"holding Rose back\\" right from the first episode due to her suggestions her daughter be content with menial employment.Davies and Cook, pp.136 Piper states that this causes Rose to resent her mum somewhat, although she loves her. Christopher Eccleston felt that Rose was the Ninth Doctor's equal in the first series. Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times felt Rose to resemble \\"the Bridget Jones type of Englishwoman, albeit a few pegs down the socioeconomic scale\\" waiting to be awakened \\"not by some Mark Darcy ... but by adventure incarnate.\\" Piper stated that at the start of the series Rose is \\"looking for something to happen\\" and that once the Doctor arrives she becomes \\"ruthless\\" in her decision to \\"completely drop her life as she knows it.\\" At a media preview of the series she characterised Rose as being \\"positive, ambitious and full of conviction and confidence.\\" She felt additionally that Rose is \\"a good character to relate to or aspire to.\\" In a 2013 retrospective on her time on Doctor Who Piper stated Rose's feminine characteristics contributed to her being a balanced representation of a female character. She felt that Rose as a character could be both \\"strong-willed and vulnerable\\" and ventured that her emotional response made her more interesting than \\"a female character endlessly striving towards perfection\\". Eccleston, who played the Ninth Doctor described the character as a \\"heroine\\" who \\"teaches [the Doctor] huge emotional lessons\\". In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential he expanded on this, describing her as \\"the Doctor's equal in every way\\" except for the fact she lacks his scientific knowledge. He felt that the relationship between the two characters was \\"love at first sight\\" although in a more mysterious fashion than a conventional love affair. Davies summarised the relationship between the two characters as \\"soul mates\\" who \\"understand and complement each other\\". Lynette Porter, in her book Tarnished Heroes, Charming Villains and Modern Monsters: Science Fiction in Shades of Gray on 21st Century Television observed that Rose's role \\"humanizes the Doctor and makes him less alien, not only to other characters, but to the audience\\".Porter pp. 99‚Äì100 In the first series finale, Rose takes on deadly energies to save the Doctor and planet Earth. Script editor Helen Raynor felt the episode gave Rose a chance to \\"again be the Doctor‚Äôs equal\\" and \\"to finally match him with a gesture that is so noble, and strong, and heroic, and clever\\". Davies describes Rose in the context of this scene, and the whole of the first series, as being \\"braver than brave and more loyal than anyone else in the universe\\". The Doctor repays her loyalty by sacrificing his ninth incarnation in turn to save her; Davies states unequivocally that \\"he gives his life for her\\". Elements of Rose's characterisation in the first series were originally different. Paul Abbott was scheduled to write an episode which would have revealed that Rose's entire life had been manipulated by the Doctor in order to mould her into an ideal companion. Davies wrote the episode \\"Boom Town\\" to replace it when Abbott realised he was too busy to work on the script. With the Tenth Doctor The second series explored new elements of the relationship between Rose and David Tennant's Doctor. In an interview with SFX producer Phil Collinson stated that after the Doctor regenerates the \\"initial dynamic changes because [Rose] has to learn to trust him again\\". Piper added that as the Doctor is incapacitated Rose consequently feels \\"unloved\\", \\"isolated\\" and \\"like she's lost her best friend\\". In the Doctor's absence Rose relies on her observations of him and tries to mimic his actions. Collinson felt it was important to resolve any mistrust between the pair by the end of the Christmas Special, as the public had responded well to Rose and the Doctor's friendship previously. Davies had scripted dialogue in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" explaining the newly regenerated Doctor's estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her way of speaking. However, due to time constraints this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having \\"come on in leaps and bounds\\" and stated she is now \\"a lot more proactive.\\" She felt that there is a \\"different kind of energy\\" between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would get to see the Doctor-companion relationship \\"developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn't before.\\" Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is \\"more tetchy and more possessive\\" over him as \\"she feels like she's lost him once and doesn't want to lose him again\\". She cited Rose's \\"catfight\\" with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in \\"School Reunion\\" as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated \\"You want it to happen, but at the same time you don't want it to happen\\". Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in The X-Files. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is more exciting than having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. \\"It's deliberate when that happens [the Doctor and Rose's arrogance]\\", said Davies, \\"and they do pay the price. In \\"Tooth and Claw\\", they set up the very thing ‚Äî Torchwood ‚Äî that separates them in the end. It's sort of their own fault.\\" Though Davies left the Doctor's response to Rose's declaration of love in \\"Doomsday\\" unstated, Gardner felt strongly that the character reciprocated her feelings. On the commentary for the episode she stated that she would \\"confirm to the world\\" that he was going to \\"say it back.\\" Davies created the expectation of Rose's return in the fourth series by mentioning her in dialogue and featuring Piper in cameo appearances in \\"Partners in Crime\\", \\"The Poison Sky\\", and \\"Midnight\\". Speaking on how Rose's character had changed between her appearances, Davies described the fourth series Rose as \\"tougher, more independent, and [she] might, at times, seem a little harder\\". Piper stated she rewatched her earlier episodes to remember how the character spoke and acted as she felt she had \\"been playing posh birds\\" since she left the programme and by contrast \\"Rose is a bit of a chav\\". Rose is re-united with the Doctor near the climax of \\"The Stolen Earth\\". Director Graeme Harper insisted that the scene appear \\"mystical\\" because the characters' reunion was \\"the most magical moment\\" in the entire episode and Ernie Vincze, the Director of Photography for the show, compared the scene's feeling to the 1980s science-fiction film Blade Runner. Davies characterised the reunion between Rose and the Doctor as \\"the biggest romance [the viewer] has ever seen\\" and joked that seminal films such as Gone with the Wind should have ended with a Dalek shooting the male lead. He had difficulty splitting up the characters for a second time for the necessity of the plot. He felt that \\"Rose has to be stupid to fall in love with Doctor #2\\" because \\"she's doing what the plot demands, not what she'd demand\\".Davies and Cook, p.326 At one stage he considered giving an explanation that Rose's dimension hopping and the Dalek's meddling with reality had contaminated her with \\"voidstuff\\" and that she would die if she stayed in her original universe.Davies and Cook, p.328 In the final episode it is enough for her to stay that the human Doctor needs her and is able to reciprocate her love. Porter felt that the climax of \\"Journey's End\\" indicated that \\"Rose's role as a sidekick has been completed\\" as she has a second Doctor to humanise, one who she can be equals with.Porter p. 100 Reprisals Davies' successor Steven Moffat did not wish to add to Rose's character arc when including Piper in a 2013 special, re-introducing her godlike, \\"Bad Wolf\\" persona instead. Though Davies had intended the serial to end with the Tenth Doctor visiting his former companions, he struggled with how to include Rose. An initial idea was for Rose to appear with her part- human Doctor in the parallel universe, where both would sense the original Tenth Doctor regenerating. However, Davies felt this would raise too many questions about their lives in the parallel universe.Davies and Cook, p.502 Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat, felt that Davies ended Rose's story in the perfect way by choosing to take it back to the beginning of her acquaintance with the Doctor. Piper's return for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary episode was confirmed in March 2013. Moffat wished to include Piper in the episode because he felt that she symbolised the rebirth of Doctor Who. As he did not feel comfortable adding to Davies' story arc, he chose instead to re-introduce her Bad Wolf persona. During the episode Piper's character has dialogue solely with John Hurt's War Doctor, and is unseen by the other characters, including the Tenth Doctor. Reviewers noted similarities between the characterisation of Bad Wolf Rose and that of a plot device used by Charles Dickens in his 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. Ted B. Kissell, a journalist for The Atlantic likened the War Doctor to Ebenezer Scrooge and dubbed Rose the \\"Ghost of Doctors Yet to Come\\". Reception Billie Piper received praise for her role as Rose. After a preview of the first series, The Guardians Owen Gibson described Rose as \\"newly empowered\\" and a \\"go-getting teen in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer mould.\\" Ahead of the series premiere on Australian Network ABC the Sydney Morning Heralds Robin Oliver described Rose's role in the series as being \\"more the Doctor's equal than previous companions\\" and that this was \\"no mean achievement against Eccleston's acting skills.\\" Seventh Doctor actor Sylvester McCoy opined that Piper was \\"wonderful in the role\\" and the relationship between her and the Doctor was \\"quite extraordinary\\". Porter suggests in her analysis of Rose that the romance between her and the Doctor widened the demographic appeal of the series. She claims that the love story \\"simmers enough below the surface that adults, especially women who find Time-Lords sexy, watched the series for Rose's interplay with the Doctor\\".Porter p. 97 In their book Who is the Doctor?, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith described the climactic kiss between the Ninth Doctor and Rose in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" as being something \\"we all secretly wanted, even though it ultimately killed him\\".Burk and Smith? p. 58 Peter Davison, who portrayed the Fifth Doctor, also felt that allowing the Doctor and his companion to have sexual tension ultimately allowed for more rounded characterization. He believed that Rose was the first example of the production team creating a well written companion. Burk and Smith found the pairing of the Doctor and Rose to be unlikable in the episode \\"Tooth and Claw\\" because they were \\"acting like smug idiots\\".Burk and Smith? p. 78 However they noted that \\"fortunately there are consequences: the season arc gets kicked off as a direct result of the Doctor and Rose being so irritating\\". Harry Venning of The Stage commented that the eventual parting scene between Rose and the Doctor in \\"Doomsday\\" was \\"beautifully written and movingly played,\\" with \\"not a dry eye in the universe\\". Burk and Smith singled out Piper's performance in the episode for special praise stating she \\"is astonishing at capturing the reality of someone whose world suddenly, finally collapses.\\"Burk and Smith? p. 119 Remarking on Piper's departure, Dek Hogan of Digital Spy stated that \\"Billie Piper‚Äôs energy has undoubtedly been one of the reasons that this revival has been so successful and the difficult third series will be so much more so without her.\\" Stephen Brook of The Guardian commented that \\"the departure of the much-loved Rose ... was brilliantly handled and completely unexpected.\\" Stephen James Walker, a writer of reference works on Doctor Who, gave an unfavourable review to Rose's return in \\"Turn Left\\" in his \\"unauthorised guide to Doctor Who's fourth series,\\" Monsters Within. He thought that Billie Piper was \\"distinctly below par\\", citing her gaunt and malnourished appearance, new hairstyle, and slight lisp as reasons why her acting was not her finest. He criticised her role in the episode, stating it had been \\"far less well worked out\\" than Donna's. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy also noted a change in Piper's enunciation; he compared her accent to \\"[having] her mouth numbed with local anaesthetic\\". In Rawson-Jones' review of the series finale he notes that whilst having the Doctor and Rose 'cop off' would be divisive with the shows audience, \\"Davies wisely managed to please both parties\\" by pairing her off with a human Doctor instead. However, IGN's Travis Fickett reacted unfavourably towards Rose's return and her pairing with the part human Doctor. He thought that it undermined her \\"perfect send off\\" in \\"Doomsday\\" as she was on the sidelines for much of \\"Journey's End\\", and her ending up with the part human, part Time Lord Doctor \\"feels like an insult to the character\\". Io9's Charlie Jane Anders also reacted unfavorably to Rose returning and wrote \\"it was pretty clear that she was only there so she could get her pet faux-Doctor at the end.\\" Reviewers generally reacted positively to Piper's 2013 appearance in 50th anniversary episode \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph called her performance as the \\"Bad Wolf\\" Rose \\"transfixing\\". Neela Debnath of The Independent praised the chemistry between Hurt and Piper and compared Piper's performance to Suranne Jones' portrayal of the TARDIS in \\"The Doctor's Wife\\" describing it as \\"slightly eccentric\\", \\"oddball\\" and \\"off-the-wall\\". Daniel Martin of the Guardian praised Steven Moffat's decision not to extend Rose Tyler's story or re-unite her with the Tenth Doctor. He called Piper \\"a true and unending legend of Doctor Who\\" and stated that \\"her wise rendition of the Bad Wolf avatar made a passable stab at the stealing of the show\\". Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times named Rose the ninth best sidekick of all time, referring to her as \\"the saucy and smart character who was key to the success of the Russell T Davies relaunch of Doctor Who in 2005\\". She was named the best Doctor Who companion by Digital Spy in 2011, who opined that she worked best alongside the Ninth Doctor. In 2006 she was voted best companion by readers of Doctor Who Magazine. In an online poll in late 2010 conducted by the Radio Times, with over 3,000 participants, Rose was again voted the most popular companion. She retained this position in a 2013 poll conducted ahead of Doctor Who's 50th anniversary, which had over 21,000 respondents, with 25.09% of the vote. In a 2012 poll conducted by BBC America with over 200,000 participants, Rose was voted \\"The Greatest Woman of Doctor Who.\\" Both The Daily Telegraph Gavin Fuller and Daniel Martin of The Guardian rated her as the second-best female companion behind Sarah Jane Smith. In 2012 Will Salmon of SFX magazine listed Rose's original exit as the greatest companion departure in the history of Doctor Who as he felt it \\"impossible not to be moved by the sudden severance of their relationship\\". In 2014 Radio Times organized the most massive online (over 2 million respondents) poll which featured every companion since 1963, beating the main —Åompetitors Jack Harkness and River Song, Rose was crowned \\"Companion Champion\\". At the 2005 National Television Awards, Billie Piper won the \\"Most Popular Actress\\" award for her role as Rose. In the BBC Online \\"Best of Drama\\" poll in 2005 Piper won the Best Actress category with 59.76% of the vote. She was also voted the Most Desirable Star with 26.47%. In January 2006 she was awarded the Breakthrough Award for Rising British Talent at The South Bank Show Awards. Piper again won the Most Popular Actress category at the 2006 National Television Awards for her work on the second series of Doctor Who. In September 2006, Piper was named Best Actress at the TV Quick and TV Choice Awards. Radio Timess Tom Cole discussed the importance of Doctor Who in boosting Piper's career in an article on how former Doctor Who actors can now expect more than \\"a life of signing autographs at provincial sci-fi conventions.\\" He notes that Piper's portrayal of Rose \\"firmly cemented her credentials as an actress\\" and cited the variety of roles she had taken on since leaving the show as proof that \\"as far as post-Who careers go, they don't get much healthier than Billie's.\\" References=Bibliography External links * Rose Tyler on the BBC's Doctor Who website Television characters introduced in 2005 Doctor Who companions Female characters in television Recurring characters in Doctor Who Fictional people from London ","title":"Rose Tyler"},{"id":"1341154","text":"Coat of arms of the counts of Alen√ßon of the House of Belleme. Coat of arms of the counts and dukes of Alen√ßon of the House of Valois. Several counts and then royal dukes of Alen√ßon have figured in French history. The title has been awarded to a younger brother of the French sovereign. History Two lines of Counts of Alen√ßon became extinct before the title of Alen√ßon was attached to the House of Valois that ruled France. Alen√ßon was granted as an appanage to Pierre, son of Louis IX of France (1268) and then to Charles, count of Valois, brother of Philip IV (1293). A third house of Alen√ßon counts descended from Charles, second son of the Count of Valois, who was killed at the Battle of Cr√©cy in 1346. The county of Alen√ßon was raised to a dukedom in 1414. Jean, 1st Duc d'Alen√ßon, was killed at Agincourt, 1415, after having with his own hand slain the Duke of York. His son, Jean, 2nd Duc d'Alen√ßon (who features in Shakespeare's Henry VI), was dispossessed of his duchy in the Battle of Verneuil on 17 August 1424: the Duke was defeated and taken prisoner by English forces led by John, Duke of Bedford. Jean reconquered his domain in 1449. In 1524 the dukedom of Alen√ßon reverted to the crown, in consequence of the death of the childless Duke Charles IV, who was married to Marguerite, sister of Francis I; Marguerite appears to have kept the title for life, as her second husband, Henry II of Navarre, used it in 1540. The title was given as a jointure to Catherine de' Medici in 1559, and as an appanage to her youngest son Francis in 1566. The title was pawned by Henry IV to the duke of W≈´rttemberg, and subsequently it passed to Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans, by grant of Louis XIII; to Elizabeth of Orl√©ans, duchess of Guise; to Charles, duke of Berry, grandson of Louis XIV (1710); and to Monsieur (later Louis XVIII), brother of Louis XVI.

He never matriculated and remained in Uppsala only one semester, before switching to a military career in accordance with the wishes and traditions of the family, enrolling in the Adelsfanan (\\"Banner of Nobles\\") cavalry regiment, and a few years later transferring to the drabantk√•ren (Garde du Corps). Gyllenhaal, however, remained in contact with Linnaeus through an extensive correspondence and continued to work as an amateur naturalist. He remained in military service until 1799, when he retired with the rank of major. As this did not take all of his time - different detachments of the Garde du Corps served at the royal court for only brief periods each year - he worked on his father's estate H√∂berg in Norra V√•nga parish in V√§sterg√∂tland, which he managed on his own from 1784. He developed the estate, experimenting with new crops such as the American maize. His main interest ever since youth was entomology, and already in 1775 he had collected some 1300 largely unidentified beetle species from the western part of G√∂taland. He built a private entomological museum, library and study on H√∂berg which he called the \\"Fly house\\". At his death, he had a collection of 400 boxes of prepared and identified insects, which he left to the Royal Swedish Society of Sciences in Uppsala (later deposited at the Uppsala University Museum of Zoology). His main publication was the Insecta Suecica, describing the insects of Sweden, which took him 30 years to complete and was awarded the gold medal of the Academy of Sciences. Another claim to fame for Gyllenhaal is the fact that he named the common beetle family of Histeridae. He was also elected an honorary member of the French Soci√©t√© entomologique. He was appointed a Knight of the Royal Order of Vasa. Curculio elephas, a beetle described by Gyllenhaal Leonard Gyllenhaal was a leading Swedenborgian who supported the printing and spreading of Swedenborg's writings. His grandson, the Swedish-American journalist Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal, retained the faith of his grandfather and was a member of the Swedenborgian New Church. His descendants in the American branch of the family include the actor siblings Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

This process turns the promise of payment (for example, in the form of a cheque or electronic payment request) into the actual movement of money from one account to another. Clearing houses were formed to facilitate such transactions among banks. Description In trading, clearing is necessary because the speed of trades is much faster than the cycle time for completing the underlying transaction. It involves the management of post-trading, pre-settlement credit exposures to ensure that trades are settled in accordance with market rules, even if a buyer or seller should become insolvent prior to settlement. Processes included in clearing are reporting/monitoring, risk margining, netting of trades to single positions, tax handling, and failure handling. Systemically important payment systems (SIPS) are payment systems which have the characteristic that a failure of these systems could potentially endanger the operation of the whole economy. In general, these are the major payment clearing or real-time gross settlement systems of individual countries, but in the case of Europe, there are certain pan-European payment systems. TARGET2 is a pan-European SIPS dealing with major inter-bank payments. STEP2, operated by the Euro Banking Association is a major pan-European clearing system for retail payments which has the potential to become a SIPS. In the United States, the Federal Reserve System is a SIPS. History=Cheque clearing The first payment method that required clearing was cheques, as cheques would have to be returned to the issuing bank for payment. Though many debit cards are drawn against chequing accounts, direct deposit and point-of- purchase electronic payments are cleared through networks separate from the cheque clearing system (in the United States, the Federal Reserve's Automated Clearing House and the private Electronic Payments Network.) Securities and derivatives clearing Securities clearing was required to ensure payment had been received and the physical stock certificate delivered. This caused a few days‚Äô delay between the trade date and final settlement. To reduce the risk associated with failure to deliver on the trade on settlement date, a clearing agent or clearing house often sat between the trading parties. The trading parties would deliver the physical stock certificate and the payment to the clearing house, who would then ensure the certificate was handed over and the payment complete. This process is known as delivery versus payment. During the 1700s the Amsterdam Stock Exchange had close links with the London Stock Exchange, and the two would often list each other's stocks. To clear the trades, time was required for the physical stock certificate or cash to move from Amsterdam to London and back. This led to a standard settlement period of 14 days, which was the time it usually took for a courier to make the journey between the two cities. Most exchanges copied the model, which was used for the next few hundred years. With the advent of the computer in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a move to reduce settlement times in most exchanges, leading by stages to a current standard of two days, known as T+2. With the advent of electronic settlement, and a move to dematerialisation of securities, standardised clearing systems were required, as well as standardised securities depositories, custodians and registrars. Until this point, many exchanges would act as their own clearing house, however the additional computer systems required to handle large volumes of trades, and the opening of new financial markets in the 1980s, such as the 1986 big bang in the UK, led to a number of exchanges separating or contracting the clearing and settlement functions to dedicated organisations. In some specialist financial markets, clearing had already been separate from trading. One example was the London Clearing House (later renamed LCH.Clearnet), which, since the 1950s, cleared derivatives and commodities for a number of London exchanges. Clearing houses who clear financial instruments, such as LCH, are generally called central counterparties (CCPs). In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 the G20 leaders agreed at the 2009 Pittsburgh Summit that all standardised derivatives contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms and cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). Although some derivatives were already traded on exchange and cleared, many over-the-counter derivatives that met the criteria needed to be novated to CCPs as a result.  United States clearing system  The United States clearing system is the largest clearing system in the world. Millions of transactions, valued in the trillions of dollars, are conducted between sellers and purchasers of goods, services, or financial assets daily. Most of the payments making up the transactions flow between several banks, most of which maintain accounts with the Federal Reserve banks. The Federal Reserve therefore performs an intermediary role, clearing and settling international bank payments. Prior to the completion of the clearing, the banks settle payment transactions by debiting the accounts of the depository institutions, while crediting the accounts of depository institutions receiving the payments. The Fedwire Funds Service provides a real-time gross settlement system in which more than 9,500 participants are able to initiate electronic funds transfers that are immediate, final, and irrevocable. Depository institutions that maintain an account with a Reserve Bank are eligible to use the service to send payments directly to, or receive payments from, other participants. Depository institutions can also use a correspondent relationship with a Fedwire participant to make or receive transfers indirectly through the system. Participants generally use Fedwire to handle large-value, time-critical payments, such as payments to settle interbank purchases and sales of federal funds; to purchase, sell, or finance securities transactions; to disburse or repay large loans; and to settle real estate transactions. The Department of the Treasury, other federal agencies, and government-sponsored enterprises also use the Fedwire Funds Service to disburse and collect funds. In 2003, the Reserve Banks processed 123 million Fed-wire payments having a total value of $436.7 trillion. The Fedwire Securities Service provides safekeeping, transfer, and settlement services for securities issued by the Treasury, federal agencies, government-sponsored enterprises, and certain international organizations. The Reserve Banks perform these services as fiscal agents for these entities. Securities are safekept in the form of electronic records of securities held in custody accounts. Securities are transferred according to instructions provided by parties with access to the system. Access to the Fed- wire Securities Service is limited to depository institutions that maintain accounts with a Reserve Bank, and a few other organizations, such as federal agencies, government-sponsored enterprises, and state government treasurer‚Äôs offices (which are designated by the U.S. Treasury to hold securities accounts). Other parties, specifically brokers and dealers, typically hold and transfer securities through depository institutions that are Fedwire participants and that provide specialized government securities clearing services. In 2003, the Fedwire Securities Service processed 20.4 million securities transfers with a value of $267.6 trillion. The ACH Network is an electronic payment system, developed jointly by the private sector and the Federal Reserve in the early 1970s as a more efficient alternative to checks. Since then, the ACH has evolved into a nationwide mechanism that processes credit and debit transfers electronically. ACH credit transfers are used to make direct deposit payroll payments and corporate payments to vendors. ACH debit transfers are used by consumers to authorize the payment of insurance premiums, mortgages, loans, and other bills from their account. The ACH is also used by businesses to concentrate funds at a primary bank and to make payments to other businesses. In 2003, the Reserve Banks processed 6.5 billion ACH payments with a value of $16.8 trillion.

New Panvel was developed on marshy land and was previously a Mango cultivated area. New Panvel is divided into two parts: New Panvel (E), on the eastern side of Panvel railway station and Khanda Colony or New Panvel (W) on the western side of it. Both parts of New Panvel are connected by a flyover bridge also known as Khanda Colony Flyover. New Panvel (W) is also popularly called Khanda Colony by the local villagers, as the city is adjacent to two small villages Dhakta Khanda and Motha Khanda (Greater Khanda). Khanda and Khandeshwar Railway stations derive their names from a very old Shiva Temple known as Khandeshwar Mahadev along the sides of the lake of Khandeshwar. The locals are host the Mahashivratri festival on the banks of the Khandeshwar lake every year. Takka Naka is a new node of New Panvel being developed by CIDCO. Major commercial activities are present in sectors 15 to 19 just outside the railway station on the eastern side. K Mall is a shopping center in New Panvel's, Takka Naka node while Orion Mall along the Mumbai-Pune highway beside the Panvel Bus depot is emerging as a shopping destination in town. The planned Navi Mumbai International Airport is expected to affect real estate prices in the surrounding area of New Panvel which are under development. Sector 17 of New Panvel West bound by JNPT bypass and NH-4 alongside Motha Khanda is located near the railway station. A few residential buildings in New Panvel West come under the \\"A Type\\" CIDCO settlements, offer budget housing for lower income groups. Geography Almost the whole of New Panvel (W) has been planned and developed. New Panvel (E) is under constant, rapid and organised development. New Panvel (E) also boasts of some good countryside view with the Prabalgad Fort and Prabalmachi Mountain located to the east. New Panvel also has a river locally known as river 'Kalundre' situated on the banks of Panvel Creek. Kauva Galli is a road near Khandeshwar temple known for its enormous crow population, large amount of crows & cranes use this place for breeding as it is near the water source of Khandeshwar lake. Demographics The development and maintenance authority of New Panvel is City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO). New Panvel is located on the eastern side of the Mumbai-Bangalore National Highway and the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. New Panvel is divided in two parts ‚Äì New Panvel East and New Panvel West, later called as Khanda Colony. They have 23 and 19 sectors respectively. New Panvel is just adjacent to the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport. A Reliance SEZ is also coming up in the vicinity. It has a number of schools, colleges and hospitals to meet the needs of its residents. Industries Panvel is surrounded by some major Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) managed regions like Patalganga, Taloja, Nagothane, Roha, Bhiwandi and Khopoli. Some of the Indian industry majors like Larsen & Toubro, Reliance, Hindustan Organic Chemicals Limited, ONGC, IPCL are based around Panvel providing mass employment. The JNPT port is also located near Panvel. New SEZ declared by government are coming around Panvel. Mega City Project Mumbai's satellite mega city, Navi Mumbai, which has gained prominence with the recent Cabinet approval for a green-field world-class airport, is witnessing hectic construction activity with India's biggest developers launching their showpiece projects in and around the city. The State Government approved Panvel Mega City Project would be implemented by the MMRDA. The city will have three parts viz. Energy City, Information Technology and Telecom City, and Entertainment City. The project is expected to create employment for 7.5 lakh people . The first phase is expected to be ready by 2014 while the entire project will be completed by 2020. Tourism in Panvel A number of tourism spots are located near Panvel. Khandeshwar park around the Khandeshwar Mahadev mandir and the Khandeshwar lake. The Karnala fort and Karnala Bird Sanctuary. Karnala is located around 65 km away from Mumbai, 120 km away from Pune and 13 km away from Panvel. The sanctuary is 25m above sea level while the fort itself is 370m above sea level. The Bet El Synagogue. The only one in Panvel which is one of the most well known religious place around where both Jews and Non-Jews can visit. Two of the eight Ashtavinayak temples of Lord Ganesha are located near Panvel, Ballaleshwar at (Pali) and Varadvinayak at Mahad near Khopoli.  Transport  Panvel is an important junction point as many major highways meet and pass through the city. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway, Sion-Panvel Expressway, NH 4B and NH 17 start from here while NH 4 passes through Panvel. The proposed SH 54 from Panvel to Bhimashankar will boost connectivity till Chakan. Roads inside New Panvel are maintained by CIDCO while those in old Panvel by PMC. New Panvel, being developed by CIDCO, has well planned and wide lane major roads and even the arterial roads are of two lanes. Old Panvel has relatively less maintained roads which are very congested due to lack of planning on part of the PMC.  Proposed airport  The new Navi Mumbai International Airport, which is to come up around the Panvel-Kopra area, would be built through public-private partnership (PPP) ‚Äî with private sector partner getting 74% equity while Airport Authority of India (AAI) and Maharashtra government through CIDCO holding 13% each. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has already given techno-feasibility clearance to the Navi Mumbai airport and central cabinet has cleared it. The airport site is located in an area of 1160 hectares accommodating two parallel runways for simultaneous & independent operations with provision of full length taxi ways on either side of the runways. The airfield has been designed to accommodate the new large aircraft compatible with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Aerodrome Code 4F. NMIA will support the rapidly growing air travel needs of Mumbai Metropolitan Region. It is expected to absorb annually 10 million passengers in its first operational year 2017, 25 million by 2020 followed by 45 million passengers in 2025 and ultimately 60 million by 2030.  Railway  Panvel railway station is one of the most important junctions on the Konkan Railway. Harbour line from Mumbai CST, central line from Diva/Karjat, western freight corridor from JNPT and the Konkan railway line from Mangalore meet at Panvel. The Panvel railway station comes under the Mumbai division of central railway. Panvel is a terminating station of Mumbai railway's harbour line. Platforms 1, 2, 3 & 4 are for suburban trains while platforms 5, 6 & 7 are for main line trains. Panvel is the busiest railway station in Navi Mumbai. 9 pairs of daily express trains, 13 pairs of non-daily express trains and 12 daily commuter (passenger) trains stop here.

The flotilla leader provided space, equipment and staff for the flotilla commodore (who typically held the rank of captain), including a wireless room, senior engineering and gunnery officers, and administrative staff to support the officers. Originally, older light or scout cruisers were often used, but in the early 1900s, the rapidly increasing speed of new destroyer designs meant that such vessels could no longer keep pace with their charges. Accordingly, large destroyer designs were produced for use as leaders. As destroyers changed from specialized anti-torpedo boat vessels that operated in squadrons to larger multi-purpose ships that operated alone or as leaders of groups of smaller vessels, and as command and control techniques improved (and the technology became more readily available), the need for specialized flotilla leaders decreased and their functions were adopted by all destroyers. The last specialized flotilla leader to be built for the Royal Navy was HMS Inglefield, launched in 1936. Subsequent leaders used the same design as the private ships of the class, with minor detailed changes to suit them to their role. In the Royal Navy, the flotilla leader and commanding officer were known as Captain (D). In the Royal Navy, flotilla leaders and divisional leaders could be identified by particular coloured bands painted on their funnels.

Haal comes from the name of the farm estate \\"Hahleg√•rden\\". In the Knighthood Letter, signed by Queen Christina, the family name was written in two different ways -- first \\"Gyllenhahl\\" and then \\"Gyllenhaal\\". On the copperplate with his coat of arms now hanging in the House of Nobility (Riddarhuset) in Stockholm, it is spelled \\"Gyllenhahl\\". Such ambiguities are typical of the time; it would be several generations before Swedish spelling was more strictly regulated. The prefix Gyllen (\\"Golden\\") was the one most used when ennobling someone since the 16th century.Similarly for the naming of the former head of car manufacturer Volvo Pehr Gustaf Gyllenhammar and Sofia Johansdotter Gyllenhielm De la Gardie.

In older Swedish, however, it was pronounced with a long \\"a\\" as in the English word \\"far\\"; the double \\"aa\\", as with the \\"ah\\" in the alternative \\"Gyllenhahl\\" (see above) only indicates a long vowel \\"a\\". The \\"o\\" sound corresponding to Danish \\"aa\\" was normally rendered by \\"√•\\" (\\"√•√•\\", \\"√•h\\").The second problem for English-speakers is how to pronounce the prefix \\"Gyllen\\", i.e. Golden. The USA branch of the family's solution is to pronounce it \\"Jill-EN-hall\\", but in Sweden \\"Gy\\" is pronounced as \\"Y\\" followed by a near-close near-front rounded vowel, comparable to the short German vowel \\"√º\\".  Family history  Escutcheon of the Gyllenhaal family hanging in the House of Nobility Nils Gunnarsson Gyllenhaal's descendants today stem from two of his sons: Lars Gyllenhaal (1645‚Äì1710), Lieutenant of the Vestgotha cavalry regiment; and his younger brother Hans Gyllenhaal (1655‚Äì1710). Hans was killed in action at the Battle of Helsingborg as a cavalry captain. The members of the older branch descending from Lars still live in Sweden. The most notable member of that branch was the Minister for Justice Lars Herman Gyllenhaal. In 1851, he was created Knight and Commander of the Royal Order of the Seraphim. His great- great grandson, Baron Herman Gyllenhaal of H√§rlingstorp (born 1934), is now the head of both branches of the noble family Gyllenhaal. He has a son Lars. All the members of the family in the United States are descended from Hans Gyllenhaal through his great great-great grandson Anders Leonard (1842‚Äì1905) and his wife Amanda (n√©e Nelson, 1859‚Äì1948). Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal immigrated to the United States in 1865. The most memorable member of this younger branch hitherto was Leonard Gyllenhaal (1752‚Äì1840). In 1807, he was created a Knight of the Royal Order of Vasa for his scientific work as an entomologist, including his monograph on Swedish insects, Insecta Suecia descripta.

According to imperial records, approximately 830,000 people lost their lives. It occurred on the morning of 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, during the Ming dynasty. More than 97 counties in the provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu and Anhui were affected. Buildings were damaged slightly in the cities of Beijing, Chengdu and Shanghai.Science Museums of China Museum of Earthquakes, Ruins of Hua County Earthquake (1556) An area was destroyed, and in some counties as much as 60% of the population was killed. Most of the population in the area at the time lived in yaodongs, artificial caves in loess cliffs; these collapsed in great numbers, causing many casualties. Geography The Shaanxi earthquake's epicenter was in the Wei River Valley in Shaanxi Province, near Huaxian (now Huazhou District of Weinan), Weinan and Huayin. In Huaxian, every single building and home was demolished, killing more than half the residents of the city, with a death toll estimated in the hundreds of thousands. The situation in Weinan and Huayin was similar. In certain areas, crevices opened in the earth. Destruction and death were everywhere, affecting places as far as from the epicenter. The earthquake also triggered landslides, which contributed to the massive death toll.History.com , History Channel's Record of the earthquake. The rupture occurred during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Therefore, in the Chinese historical record, this earthquake is often referred to as the Jiajing Great earthquake. Modern estimates, based on geological data, give the earthquake a magnitude of approximately 8 on the moment magnitude scale or XI on the Mercalli scale, though more recent discoveries have shown that it was 7.9. While it was the deadliest earthquake and the third-deadliest natural disaster in history, there have been earthquakes with considerably higher magnitudes. Following the earthquake, aftershocks continued several times a month for half a year.Kepu.ac.cn, China virtual museums quake In the annals of China it was described in this manner: The earthquake damaged many of the Forest of Stone steles badly. Of the 114 Kaicheng Stone Classics, 40 were broken in the earthquake. The scholar Qin Keda lived through the earthquake and recorded details. One conclusion he drew was that \\"at the very beginning of an earthquake, people indoors should not go out immediately. Just crouch down and wait. Even if the nest has collapsed, some eggs may remain intact.\\"Kisti.re.kr, China virtual museums quake The shaking reduced the height of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi'an by three levels. Loess caves Millions of people at the time lived in artificial loess caves on high cliffs in the area of the Loess Plateau. Loess is the silty soil that windstorms have deposited on the plateau over the ages. The soft loess clay formed over thousands of years due to wind blowing silt into the area from the Gobi Desert. Loess is a highly erosion-prone soil that is susceptible to the forces of wind and water. The Loess Plateau and its dusty soil cover almost all of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces and parts of others. Much of the population lived in dwellings called yaodongs in these cliffs. This was the major contributing factor to the very high death toll. The earthquake collapsed many caves and caused landslides, which destroyed many more. Cost The cost of damage done by the earthquake is almost impossible to measure in modern terms. The death toll, however, has been traditionally given as 820,000 to 830,000. The accompanying property damage would have been incalculable‚Äîan entire region of inner China had been destroyed and an estimated 60% of the region's population died. Foreign reaction The Portuguese Dominican friar Gaspar da Cruz, who visited Guangzhou later in 1556, heard about the earthquake, and later reported about it in the last chapter of his book A Treatise of China (1569). He viewed the earthquake as a possible punishment for people's sins, and the Great Comet of 1556 as, possibly, the sign of this calamity (as well as perhaps the sign of the birth of the Antichrist).

He also studied at the North Texas State and University of California at Los Angeles. From 1961, Carter was based mainly on the West Coast. There he met Bobby Bradford in 1965, with whom he subsequently worked on a number of projects, notably the New Jazz Art Ensemble. He also played with Hampton Hawes and Harold Land. In the 1970s Carter became well known on the basis of his extraordinary solo concerts. At New Jazz Festival Moers 1979 he and the German clarinet player Theo J√∂rgensmann performed on three days. Afterwards Carter received complimentary reviews and wide recognition from around the world. He and J√∂rgensmann met again in 1984. The program of the Berlin JazzFest was built around the clarinet. After Carter's solo performance, he and J√∂rgensmann also played together. Between 1982 and 1990 Carter composed and recorded Roots and Folklore: Episodes in the Development of American Folk Music, five albums focused on African Americans and their history. The complete set was acclaimed by jazz critics as containing some of the best releases of the 1980s. A clarinet quartet with Perry Robinson, J√∂rgensmann and Eckard Koltermann was planned for 1991, but Carter did not recover from a nonmalignant tumor.

He installed the railway telegraph lines between Edinburgh and Glasgow. Early life Bain was born in Houstry, near Watten, Caithness, Scotland. He was baptised in the local kirk on 22 November 1810. His father was a crofter. He had a twin sister, Margaret, and, in total, he had six sisters and six brothers. Bain did not excel in school and was apprenticed to a clockmaker in Wick. Career Electric clock, Alexander Bain, London, ca. 1845 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2004-162) Having learned the art of clockmaking, he went to Edinburgh, and in 1837 to London, where he obtained work as a journeyman in Clerkenwell. Bain frequented the lectures at the Polytechnic Institution and the Adelaide Gallery and later constructed his own workshop in Hanover Street. Electric clocks In 1840, desperate for money to develop his inventions, Bain mentioned his financial problems to the editor of the Mechanics Magazine, who introduced him to Sir Charles Wheatstone. Bain demonstrated his models to Wheatstone, who, when asked for his opinion, said \\"Oh, I shouldn't bother to develop these things any further! There's no future in them.\\"Lord Robert Winston, Bad Ideas?: An arresting history of our inventions, London 2010, p. 221 Three months later Wheatstone demonstrated an electric clock to the Royal Society, claiming it was his own invention. However, Bain had already applied for a patent for it. Wheatstone tried to block Bain's patents, but failed. When Wheatstone organised an Act of Parliament to set up the Electric Telegraph Company, the House of Lords summoned Bain to give evidence, and eventually compelled the company to pay Bain ¬£10,000 and give him a job as manager, causing Wheatstone to resign. Bain's first patent was dated 11 January 1841, and was in the names of John Barwise, chronometer maker, and Alexander Bain, mechanist. It describes his electric clock which uses a pendulum kept moving by electromagnetic impulses. He improved on this in later patents, including a proposal to derive the required electricity from an \\"earth battery\\", which consisted of plates of zinc and copper buried in the ground. In December 1841, Bain in conjunction with Lieutenant Thomas Wright RN, patented a method for using electricity to control railway engines by turning off steam, marking time, giving signals, and printing information at different locations. The most significant idea incorporated in the patent was his plan for inverting the needle telegraph earlier developed by Ampere, Wheatstone and others: instead of making signals by a pivoted magnetic needle under the influence of an electromagnet, he made them by suspending a movable coil between the poles of a fixed magnet. A similar concept appears in Sir William Thomson's siphon recorder. Bain also proposed to make the coil record messages by printing them, an idea he developed further in a subsequent patent. His telegraph was also successful abroad: \\"The initial Austrian Bain instruments were made by Johann Michael Ekling in Vienna, and later by the k.k. Telegraphenwerkst√§tte Wein, the Imperial Royal Telegraph Workshops Vienna.\\"http://distantwriting.co.uk/bain.html > \\"For many years I have devoted myself to rendering electricity practically > useful, and have been extensively engaged, not only in this country, but in > America and on the Continent, in the construction and working of the > Electric Telegraph; while at the same time, the employment of electricity in > the measurement of time has also engaged my attention.\\" Alexander Bain, A > Short History of the Electric ClocksAlexander Bain, A Short History of the > Electric Clocks, London 1852, p. 3 =Surviving examples= Bain's extant electric clocks come from two stages of development between the 1840s and the 1860s. Examples can be seen in Watten's Village Hall, the National Museum of Scotland, the National Maritime Museum of London, the London Science Museum and the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum. The most rare and interesting mantel clocks are in private hands. One featured in the \\"Electrifying Time\\" exhibition in 1977 at the London Science Museum. Bain sometimes found complex and ornate solutions to relatively simple, although not easy to solve problems. The most complex, his mantel clock, worked on an electro-magnetic pull push, pull push for each complete period of swing employing a pendulum with opposing magnetic fields. At a very similar time, Matth√§us Hipp constructed a more simple and reliable system which used a simple toggle switch to impulse the pendulum every so often. Facsimile machine Bain's improved facsimile 1850 Bain worked on an experimental fax machine from 1843 to 1846. He used a clock to synchronise the movement of two pendulums for line-by-line scanning of a message. For transmission, Bain applied metal pins arranged on a cylinder made of insulating material. An electric probe that transmitted on-off pulses then scanned the pins. The message was reproduced at the receiving station on electrochemically sensitive paper impregnated with a chemical solution similar to that developed for his chemical telegraph. In his patent description dated 27 May 1843 for \\"improvements in producing and regulating electric currents and improvements in timepieces, and in electric printing, and signal telegraphs,\\" he claimed that \\"a copy of any other surface composed of conducting and non-conducting materials can be taken by these means\\".J. Polhemus, The Leading Telegraph Patents, Including Original and Reissued Patents, of S. F. B. Morse, 1878, p.154 The transmitter and receiver were connected by five wires. In 1850 he applied for an improved version but was too late, as Frederick Bakewell had obtained a patent for his superior \\"image telegraph\\" two years earlier in 1848. Bain's and Bakewell's laboratory mechanisms reproduced poor quality images and were not viable systems because the transmitter and receiver were never truly synchronized. In 1861, the first practical operating electro- mechanical commercially exploited telefax machine, the Pantelegraph, was invented by the Italian physicist Giovanni Caselli. He introduced the first commercial telefax service between Paris and Lyon at least 11 years before the invention of workable telephones.Istituto Tecnico Industriale, Rome, Italy. Italian biography of Giovanni CaselliThe Hebrew University of Jerusalem - Giovanni Caselli biography Chemical telegraph On 12 December 1846, Bain, who was then living in Edinburgh, patented a chemical telegraph. He had seen that the Morse and other telegraphs then in use were comparatively slow, due to the mechanical inertia of their moving parts, and realized that the signal current could be used to make a readable mark on a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, which gave a blue mark when a current was passed through it. The speed at which marks could be made on the paper was so high that hand signalling could not keep up with it, and so Bain devised a method of automatic signalling using punched paper tape. The concept was later used by Wheatstone in his automatic sender. Bain's chemical telegraph was tried between Paris and Lille, and attained a speed of 282 words in 52 seconds, a great advance on Morse's telegraph which could only give about 40 words per minute. In England Bain's telegraph was used on the wires of the Electric Telegraph Company to a limited extent, and in 1850 it was used in America by Henry O'Reilly. However, it incurred the hostility of Samuel Morse, who obtained an injunction against it on the grounds that the paper tape and alphabet used fell under his patent. Consequently, by 1859 Bain's telegraph was in use on only one line and never really entered general usage. Later life Initially Bain made a considerable sum from his inventions but lost his wealth in poor investments. In 1873, Sir William Thomson, Sir William Siemens, Latimer Clark and others obtained a Civil List pension for Bain from Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone of ¬£80 per year. Death and legacy A commemorative plaque to Bain at his former workshop on Hanover Street in Edinburgh. Bain was buried in the Auld Aisle Cemetery, Kirkintilloch. It was restored in 1959. The headstone had a fallacious date of death (1876) which was later corrected to 1877. JD Wetherspoons pub in Wick, close to where Alexander Bain served his apprenticeship, is now named 'The Alexander Bain' after the inventor. Also, as a tribute to his inventions, the main BT building in Glasgow is named Alexander Bain House. One of the earliest examples of an electrically impulsed pendulum clock is on display at the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum. In 2016, he was posthumously awarded the Technology & Engineering Emmy Award \\"for his pioneering work in the transmission of images\\". The statuette is on display in Kirkintilloch Town Hall.

From the 1860s Hunter was interested in conservation of public open spaces, and worked with other pioneers in this field, including Octavia Hill and Hardwicke Rawnsley. After acting as adviser to Hill in her campaigns to save Hampstead Heath and other open spaces, he worked with Rawnsley to save land in the English Lake District from industrial development. In 1893 the three campaigners agreed to set up a national body to acquire vulnerable properties and preserve them for the nation. At Hunter's suggestion it was entitled \\"the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty\\", generally known simply as \\"the National Trust\\". Hunter was the founding chairman of the trust's executive board. From 1882 until the year of his death Hunter was solicitor to the General Post Office. His negotiations in that capacity were estimated to have saved the British taxpayer many millions of pounds. Life and career=Early years Hunter was born in the south London suburb of Camberwell, the elder child and only son of Robert Lachlan Hunter, a master mariner and shipowner, and his wife, Anne, n√©e Lachlan. He was educated privately until 1861 when he was admitted to University College, London. In the same year his family left London for Dorking, which was his first contact with the commons and hills of Surrey which he would come to love in later life. Hunter was awarded a first-class degree in logic and moral philosophy in 1863.\\"University Intelligence\\", The Times, 15 December 1863, p. 6 At his father's suggestion he took up a post as an articled clerk in a firm of solicitors in London. Finding the work uninteresting he read for a master's degree in his spare time.Smith, John Oliver. \\"Sir Robert Hunter\\", accessed 4 June 2012 In 1866 the philanthropist and politician Henry Peek ran a contest offering prizes of ¬£400 for essays on the best means of preserving common land for the public. Hunter's entry, \\"The Preservation of Commons in the Neighbourbood of the Metropolis\\", was one of six winning essays. He traced the history and legal standing of the rights of common: \\"substantial privileges which were maintainable at law. Though a person claiming common of pasture in another's soil had no interest in that soil, yet he had a certain right over it, and could prevent by legal process any dealings with it which would prejudice this right.\\"Hunter, p. 328 This principle, Hunter maintained, had been extended from old grazing rights to a modern requirement that common land should not be enclosed without due regard for \\"the health, comfort and convenience of the inhabitants\\" of nearby urban areas.Hunter, p. 345 The six essays were published in one volume in 1867.\\"On the Preservation of Commons\\", The Times, 4 September 1867, p. 10 In the same year Hunter was admitted solicitor. He became a partner in Fawcett, Horne, and Hunter, solicitors to the recently established Commons Preservation Society.Chubb, L W. \\"Hunter, Sir Robert (1844‚Äì1913)\\", rev. Graham Murphy, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, October 2007, accessed 3 June 2012 Commons Preservation Society Octavia Hill Hunter worked with the society to save common land from enclosure. He instituted legal actions that ensured protection of Hampstead Heath, and Berkhamsted, Plumstead, Wimbledon and Tooting commons and other open spaces threatened with enclosure.\\"Mr. Shaw-Lefevre on the Preservation of Commons\\", The Times, 11 December 1886, p. 10 Most of the principles of public interest expounded in his 1866 essay were incorporated into English law in 1875. From the latter year onwards, Hunter was Octavia Hill's adviser on the protection of open spaces in London. One of Hunter's most celebrated successes was the rescue from enclosure of 3,000 acres of Epping Forest, with the support of the corporation of the City of London. The case was bitterly contested across three years. Hunter acted with the corporation's solicitor, Sir Thomas Nelson, in the conduct of the legal proceedings.\\"Epping Forest\\", The Times, 4 May 1882, p. 10 In 1882 Queen Victoria went to the forest and formally declared it \\"available for her people's enjoyment\\". Post Office A leading member of the Commons Preservation Society during this period was the Liberal politician Henry Fawcett. He was appointed Postmaster General by Gladstone in 1880. When the post of solicitor to the General Post Office (GPO) became vacant in 1881 Fawcett decided that Hunter would be the best choice for the position. Hunter's fitness for the post was confirmed by independent advisers and he was appointed on 1 February 1882. Fawcett later said that nothing in his official career had given him more satisfaction than securing a man of Hunter's character and ability for the service of the nation. Hunter remained as solicitor to the GPO until the year of his death. Much of his work was in preparing draft legislation on Post Office matters to be put before Parliament. There were more than fifty such drafts during Hunter's tenure. His biographer L W Chubb singles out the Conveyance of Mails Act, 1893, which established an arbitration procedure for disputes between the railway companies and the GPO about charges for transporting mail by train. Chubb calculates that this one measure saved the taxpayer more than ¬£10m. Hunter's other most important contribution, in Chubb's view, was the negotiation of the terms for acquiring the National Telephone Company's system, which saved another ¬£8.5m. National Trust In 1883 Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley was engaged in a campaign to stop the construction of railways from quarries in the fells overlooking Buttermere, in the English Lake District, with damaging effect on the unspoilt scenery. He secured the support of John Ruskin, Octavia Hill and Hunter, and was successful in stopping the development.Murphy, Graham. \\"Rawnsley, Hardwicke Drummond (1851‚Äì1920)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 4 June 2012 Both Hunter and Rawnsley, building on an idea put forward by Ruskin, advocated a trust that could buy and preserve places of natural beauty and historic interest for the nation. The need for such a body was emphasised in 1886, when the owner of Sayes Court, a manor house in Deptford, wished to give it to the nation, but could not because no national organisation existed to accept the gift. He established a permanent trust under the chairmanship of the vicar of the parish, and presented the house and gardens with a substantial financial endowment to maintain them.\\"Sayes Court, Deptford\\", The Times, 20 July 1886, p. 5 Hardwicke Rawnsley In November 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley met at the offices of the Commons Preservation Society. They agreed to set up a national body, to propagate the formation of a \\"National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty\\". In July 1894 the trust was formally inaugurated under the presidency of the Duke of Westminster.\\"A Proposed National Trust\\", The Times, 17 July 1894, p. 12 At the inaugural meeting Rawnsley declared, to cheering, that the aim was to establish \\"a great National Gallery of natural pictures\\". Hunter was appointed chairman of the executive committee. In the same year he was knighted for his services to conservation. Hunter had warned the inaugural meeting that the trust would be on a truly secure footing only if it obtained the permanent status granted by either a royal charter or an Act of Parliament. He drafted the 1907 National Trust Bill, which was put before Parliament, giving the trust the status of a statutory corporation. He gave formal evidence to the parliamentary committee that scrutinised the bill,\\"Parliamentary Committees\\", The Times, 26 July 1907. p. 4 and the bill was passed in August 1907.\\"An Act to incorporate and confer powers upon the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty\\" , The National Trust, accessed 4 June 2012 By the time of the 1907 Act, the trust had acquired 25 properties in England, Wales and Ireland, ranging from 850 acres of open country in the Lake District, to common land in Surrey to castles in County Cork and Derbyshire to coastal land in Cornwall and Cambridgeshire. Hunter was appointed CB in 1909 and promoted to KCB in 1911 for his services to the Post Office. He retired at the end of July 1913, and died at the age of 69 of toxaemia less than four months later at his house at Meadfields Hanger, Haslemere, Surrey. Fourteen acres of water and woodland at Waggoners Wells were bought by public subscription and given to the National Trust to honour his memory. Personal life In 1869 Hunter married Emily Browning; she died in childbirth on 2 January 1872. He did not remarry until May 1877. His second wife, Ellen n√©e Cann (1851‚Äì1932) was the daughter of a land surveyor, Samuel Cann. There were three daughters of the second marriage. In politics, The Times said, \\"Sir Robert was a robust thoughtful Liberal of the older type. As a speaker he was admirably clear and direct, articulate but not rhetorical, relying far more on the persuasive forced of exact statement than on appeals to emotion.\\"The Times Obituary:Sir Robert Hunter, 7 November 1913.

The book tells the story of a novelist, struggling to finish a novel, who travels to Lebanon to assist a writer being held hostage. The title is derived from a series of Andy Warhol silkscreen prints depicting Mao Zedong. DeLillo dedicated the book to his friend Gordon Lish. Major themes of the book include crowds and the effects of political terrorism. Mao II received positive reviews from critics and won the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1992. Plot summary A reclusive novelist named Bill Gray works endlessly on a novel which he chooses not to finish. He has chosen a lifestyle secluded from the outside world in order to try to keep his writing pure. He, along with his assistant Scott, believes that something is lost once a mass audience reads the work. Scott would prefer Bill didn't publish the book for fear that the mass-production of the work will destroy the \\"real\\" Bill. Bill has a dalliance with Scott's partner Karen Janney, a former member of the Unification Church who is married to Kim Jo Pak in a Unification Church Blessing ceremony in the prologue of the book. Bill, who lives as a complete recluse, accedes to be photographed by a New York photographer named Brita who is documenting writers. In dialogue with Brita and others, Bill laments that novelists are quickly becoming obsolete in an age where terrorism has supplanted art as the \\"raids on consciousness\\" that jolt and transform culture at large. Bill disappears without a word and secretly decides to accept an opportunity from his former editor Charles to travel to London to publicly speak on the behalf of a Swiss writer held hostage in war-torn Beirut. Meanwhile, Karen ends up living in Brita's New York apartment and spends most of her time in the homeless slums of Tompkins Square Park. In London, Bill is introduced to George Haddad, a representative of the Maoist group responsible for kidnapping the writer. Bill decides to go to Lebanon himself and negotiate the release of the writer. Cutting himself off from Charles, he flees to Cyprus where he awaits a ship that will take him to Lebanon. In Cyprus, Bill is hit by a car and suffers a lacerated liver which, exacerbated by his heavy drinking, kills him in his sleep while en route to Beirut. In the epilogue, Brita goes to Beirut to photograph Abu Rashid, the terrorist responsible for the kidnapping. The fate of the hostage is never revealed, though the implication is grim. The plot unfolds with DeLillo's customary shifts of time, setting, and character. Themes The last sentence of the prologue reveals an important and major theme in Mao II: \\"The future belongs to crowds.\\" Crowds feature heavily in the book, from the opening crowds of thousands at the mass wedding at Yankee Stadium, to the crowds living in Tompkins Square Park, to the thousands of mourners at the Ayatollah's funeral as observed on television by Karen. The nature of crowds and their relation to personal and collective identity are explored. In predicting an age of terror in which \\"the major work involves midair explosions and crumbled buildings,\\" DeLillo was eerily ahead of his time in contemplating the profound effect that political terror was soon to have on American society. The question of the efficacy of art in the context of dogmatism and violence of a massive scale is central to the narrative. In preparing the novel, DeLillo's editor at Viking, Nan Graham, said, \\"Long before he had written anything Don told me he had two folders -- one marked 'art' and the other marked 'terror.'\\"\\"Dangerous Don DeLillo\\", May 19, 1991 New York Times Just two years before the novel was published Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the death of Salman Rushdie after his publication of The Satanic Verses and New York Post photographers had ambushed J. D. Salinger in New Hampshire. DeLillo cited the published Salinger photograph and a photograph of a Unification Church Blessing ceremony he came across as inspiration for the book, telling Vince Passaro: Reception In The Washington Post, Sven Birkerts referred to Mao II as one of DeLillo's best novels. While arguing that \\"the tension that gathers around Gray dissipates towards the end and the final pages feel unfocused\\", Birkerts praised the ways in which the crowd motif is threaded throughout the novel and also praised the secondary characters, writing, \\"There is always a new angle, a new window onto a world in its paroxysms of transformation.\\" Birkerts lauded the work as \\"DeLillo's strongest statement yet about the crisis of crises. Namely: that we are living in the last violet twilight of the individual\\". Lorrie Moore of The New York Times stated that \\"no one's prose is better than Mr. DeLillo's\\", and noted the author's \\"way of capturing a representative slice of a city, his ability to reproduce ineffable urban rhythms, his startling evocations of sights and smells.\\" While writing that she was more \\"engaged and impressed\\" than moved by Mao II and that the novel has less emotional depth than White Noise and Libra, Moore still praised DeLillo's ability to convey multiple points of view and argued that \\"within its own defined parameters [...] Mr. DeLillo's new book succeeds as brilliantly as any of his others.\\" A reviewer for Publishers Weekly deemed the novel a \\"remarkable achievement\\" and stated, \\"The beauty of DeLillo's prose enlivens such seemingly dry questions. Mao II reconfirms DeLillo's status as a modern master and literary provocateur.\\" It also received praise in Kirkus Reviews, where the reviewer wrote that the author's \\"talking heads murmur the mysteries of our age. For all its 'cool gloom,' his latest novel stands in denial of Gray's doom-drenched semiotics: it's a luminous book, full of anger deflected into irony, with moments of hard-earned transcendence.\\" Conversely, John Lanchester argued in the London Review of Books that Mao II had a \\"rather over-schematic central theme and plot-strand‚Äù and criticized the novel as \\"[trying] to force home Gray‚Äôs arguments that ‚Äòwhat terrorists gain, novelists lose‚Äô. This, oddly enough, is to do those ideas a disservice, as, in Keats's famous words, ‚Äòwe hate poetry that has a palpable design on us.‚Äô I don‚Äôt think I will be the only reader of Mao II to miss DeLillo in his comic vein, the comic vein which hasn‚Äôt at all precluded seriousness in his other work; its absence in Mao II is, I‚Äôm afraid, likely to have something to do with a vocational self-importance.\\" In The New York Review of Books, Robert Towers wrote, \\"Mao II is a more somber work, less concentrated as a narrative; and it is shorter than either of its predecessors. The cast of characters is relatively small, and the characters themselves, while sharply delineated, are perhaps less interesting in the long run than the images and themes that cluster around them.\\" Mao II was placed in the second tier (\\"Recommended\\") in a 2007 New York guide to DeLillo's oeuvre, where the novel was described as \\"DeLillo at his most aphoristic [...] Less a novel than a series of crowd-scene set pieces linked by a reclusive novelist‚Äôs attempt to free a poet hostage, it contains his most extended thoughts on the relationship between fiction and terrorism.\\" In 2011, Martin Amis listed Mao II among his favorite novels in DeLillo‚Äôs output. In a 2016 retrospective write-up for Granta, Colin Barrett lauded Mao II as a \\"mordantly funny, casually prescient, hypnotically condensed novel about art, about terror [...] short, loosely plotted but simultaneously tight as a drum\\". Jeff Somers ranked it sixth among 17 DeLillo books, arguing that \\"it doesn‚Äôt have much of a plot and can be perceived as DeLillo disappearing into himself‚Äîbut when you‚Äôre as strong a writer as DeLillo, you can get away with that. Its seemingly prophetic vision of terrorist acts to come (it was published in 1991) grant the book gravitas\\".

Early life and education Born to a Jewish family,Silbiger, Steve The Jewish Phenomenon: Seven Keys to the Enduring Wealth of a People p. 91 Levy attended Townsend Harris High School and studied psychology at City College of New York. After serving in the U.S. Army, he began working as a research analyst. He was strongly influenced in his business approach by his father, Jerome Levy, an economist and business executive who emphasized the role corporate profits play in charting the economy's direction.  Investment career  In 1956 he became a partner of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc, then in 1959 Levy co-founded the Oppenheimer mutual funds. There he started dozens of mutual funds that, at his death, had grown to manage more than $120 billion. In 1982, he sold both companies to the U.K.'s Mercantile House for $162 million and co-founded Odyssey Partners, a private investment partnership. It grew to be a $3 billion hedge fund before it was dissolved in 1997. Wealth and philanthropy In 1986, to honor his father, he founded the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, now the Levy Institute, at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.About the Levy Economics Institute. The Levy Institute has established itself as a sponsor of extensive work in Keynesian and post-Keynesian economics. In the last year of his life, Levy commuted up the Hudson River from New York City to teach a class at the Levy Institute, \\"Contemporary Developments in Finance\\", in which he focused on his belief that investing is as much a psychological as it is an economic act. When he died in his late seventies, Levy was estimated to be worth a billion dollars, though his personal wealth might have been substantially higher were it not for his philanthropic interests. Levy's philanthropy began in the 1950s, when he established the Jerome Levy Foundation, which still exists, giving grants to human rights and land preservation organizations. His donations grew steadily, and during his lifetime, Levy and his wife, Shelby White, gave away more than $200 million, becoming well known for their philanthropic efforts. They donated $20 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the construction of the Leon Levy and Shelby White Court,Hugh Eakin and Randy Kennedy, \\"Doubts on Donors' Collection Cloud Met Antiquities Project\\", The New York Times, December 10, 2005. a gallery hosting the largest selection of Hellenistic and Roman artwork ever exhibited at that museum. The gallery included a number of pieces from Levy and White's substantial art collection, which also includes art from the Near East. Between 1997 and 2003, Levy and White donated nearly $5 million to 107 scholars for the publication of archaeological excavations that had been completed but never published. The projects funded by their program, the Shelby White-Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications, include excavations at some of the highest profile archaeological sites throughout Greece and the Middle East, including Knossos, Aphrodisias, Kition, Ras Shamra, Sarepta, Mt. Gerizim, Ekron, Lachish, Megiddo, Jerusalem, Pella, Jerash, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Assur, Nineveh, Nuzi, and Tepe Hissar.Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications.

Levy also served as President of the Board of the Institute for Advanced Study, Vice Chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, and was a director of Bard College, and many other not-for-profit boards. The Leon Levy Foundation and Shelby White, as Chairman of the Friends of the Israel Antiquities Authority, provided the funds for conserving the extraordinarily well-preserved Lod Mosaic and established the Shelby White and Leon Levy Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center, which will house the mosaic once it returns from its 2010-2016 international exhibition tour. After his death in 2003, Levy's philanthropy was continued through the Leon Levy Foundation, and one of its earliest initiatives was the fulfillment of that plan. In spring, 2006, the Leon Levy Foundation pledged $200 million to New York University for the creation of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, a center for advanced scholarly research and graduate education, intended to cultivate cross-cultural study of the ancient world, from the western Mediterranean to China. Antiquities controversy The donation created controversy among some academics who believe that collectors of antiquities encourage the looting of ancient sites. In their 2006 book The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities - From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums, Peter Watson and Cecelia Todeschini lay out the dynamics of the illegal trade in antiquities and use Leon Levy and Shelby White as an example of collectors whose purchases may have led to unethical dealing in artifacts. One NYU professor, Randall White, resigned from NYU's existing Center for Ancient Studies - which is independent of the new Institute for the Study of the Ancient World - saying that he opposed the acceptance of a donation from a foundation whose benefactor had sometimes been associated with such questionable practices and trafficking. Several scholars outside NYU, notably from Bryn Mawr College, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cincinnati, also commented negatively on NYU's acceptance of the gift. Many other scholars, however, supported the institute and the gift. Professor James McCredie, of the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU's graduate teaching and advanced research center for art history, wrote a letter to Provost David McLaughlin endorsing the project. It was signed by IFA's seven professors of ancient art and architecture, and the controversy soon died out.Pogrebin, Robin (April 1, 2002) \\"$200 Million Gift Prompts a Debate Over Antiquities\\" The New York Times  Legacy and awards  In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, George Soros, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman and Steven A.

She worked with four leaders of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada - John Diefenbaker, Robert Stanfield, Joe Clark and Brian Mulroney - from 1962 to 1993 before being appointed to the Senate on the advice of Mulroney. She sat as a Progressive Conservative Senator from her appointment until moving with most of her caucus colleagues to the new Conservative Party of Canada in 2004, of which she was soon elected to Chief Whip. She served as an advisor to then opposition leader Stephen Harper during the 2006 election, which the Conservative Party won. After the election, she was named to the cabinet position Leader of the Government in the Senate. On July 4, 2013, LeBreton announced she would not continue in the position as of the next cabinet shuffle, which occurred later that summer. She retired from the Senate upon reaching her 75th birthday on July 4, 2015.  Early and personal life  Marjory LeBreton was born in and completed her elementary and secondary school education in the neighbourhood of City View, in the city of Nepean, Ontario which is today part of Ottawa. She is married to Douglas LeBreton, with whom she had two children: Linda and Michael. Linda was killed in an accident involving a drunk driver which led to LeBreton's active involvement in the Mothers Against Drunk Driving organization.  Progressive Conservative staffer  LeBreton began working at Progressive Conservative party headquarters in 1962, moving from there to the office of leader John Diefenbaker when he became opposition leader following the 1963 election. During her time in the leader's office, she accompanied him on a national whistlestop tour during the 1965 election. Following Diefenbaker's resignation as leader, she continued in the leader's office under Robert Stanfield through his three election campaigns - 1968, 1972 and 1974. When Stanfield announced his resignation in 1975, she went to work in the PC Party office helping to coordinate the 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. Joe Clark won the 1976 convention and hired LeBreton as his office's tour coordinator, a position she held until Clark won the 1979 federal election. LeBreton later worked in the office of Brian Mulroney while he was prime minister, rising to position of Deputy Chief of Staff and Government Appointments Director. She was appointed by Mulroney to the Senate on June 18, 1993, shortly before his retirement from politics.  Senator  LeBreton is generally considered to be a Red Tory and is progressive on social issues such as abortion rights. She was also one of the few politicians in the Parliament of Canada to oppose Bill C-36, Canada's anti-terrorism legislation in 2001. She was a long-time foe of proposals to merge the Progressive Conservatives with the Canadian Alliance but reluctantly supported the late 2003 proposal to unite the parties and subsequently became a Conservative Party of Canada senator once the merger was completed. Over time, she warmed to the new party, and later served as one of Stephen Harper's top advisors in the 2006 federal election. Senator LeBreton was appointed Leader of the Government in the Senate by Prime Minister Stephen Harper In February 2006 and also acquired the role of Secretary of State for Seniors during a cabinet shuffle on January 4, 2007.

It is owned by American University, and its studios are located near the campus in northwest Washington. WAMU has been the primary National Public Radio member station for Washington since 2007. History WAMU began as an AM carrier-current student radio station, signing on July 28, 1951 on , before shifting to in March 1952 and in November 1952.. The station was heralded as a rebirth of the university's prior radio station, WAMC, which operated on for two years starting in January 1947. Although carrier-current stations are not granted a license or call sign by the FCC, it used \\"WAMU\\" as a familiar form of identification. The station aired a wide range of student-produced programming including music, news, sports, radio dramas, and debates. Throughout the late 1950s, students and faculty pushed to create an FM station that could reach beyond campus and serve Washington, D.C., as a whole. In late 1960, the university received a non-commercial FM broadcasting license, and WAMU made its first FM broadcast on October 23, 1961, on using a 4,000 watt second-hand transmitter acquired from WGBH in Boston. Although it was not strictly necessary as the AM carrier-current station's call sign was not official, the FM station took the suffixed call sign \\"WAMU-FM\\" to differentiate itself. It dropped the -FM suffix in 1981. WAMU-FM station was established as an \\"education station\\" operated by the university, not as a student-run station. Despite this, about 75 AU students, many of whom also worked carrier-current station produced local programming for WAMU-FM. In its first year of operation, WAMU simulcast the same programming, which included educational programs, dramas, and classical music, on AM and FM for three hours each evening. From its inception as a student-run station, WAMU provided public affairs and educational programming. With the launch of its FM service in 1961, WAMU joined the nascent National Educational Radio Network, a predecessor to NPR. In 1971, the station was a founding member of National Public Radio. In 1967, WAMU-FM began programming bluegrass music which, in its heyday on the main channel, included the Lee Michael Demsey Show and the Ray Davis Show and weekends included Stained Glass Bluegrass and West Virginia Public Radio's Mountain Stage. The station hosted an annual bluegrass concert at Fairfax High School, as well as the yearly \\"Pickin' in the Glen\\" concert, featuring performers such as Alison Krauss, Tony Rice, the Gibson Brothers, the Lewis Family, Hot Rize, and Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers. However, starting in the late 1990s, the station began paring back its on-air bluegrass programming in favor of news/talk programming. In summer 2001, the station fully transitioned its weekday programming to all news and public affairs from various providers including NPR, PRI, APM and the BBC World Service, and in September 2007 the station removed the last of its bluegrass programming from its main channel, shifting it all to the HD2 subchannel. On May 7, 2004, WAMU-FM began digital broadcasting using the HD Radio standard and launched the Americana-music station Bluegrass Country on its HD2 subchannel. The station also operated for several years an HD3 service, WAMU-3, broadcasting a mix of talk and music programming, including simulcast programming from Towson University's WTMD. Also in 2004, the prominent Washington journalist Ellen Wadley Roper left WAMU a $250,000 bequest, the largest gift in the station's history. When fellow public radio station WETA returned to an all-classical music format in 2007, WAMU became Washington, D.C.'s only full-time public news station, ending two years of competition between the stations for D.C.'s NPR news audience. In summer 2010, WAMU launched an Eastern Shore relay service on WRAU in Ocean City, Maryland. WRAU includes local content, such as news, traffic, and weather, along with simulcasts of WAUM's main channel programming. In December 2015, WAMU executives announced that long-time program host Diane Rehm, who began working at WAMU in 1973, would be stepping down from her show following the 2016 Presidential election, representing a major shake-up in WAMU's programming lineup. Rehm, then 79, stated that she wanted a younger voice to take her place at WAMU. Also, Kojo Nnamdi lost his local public affairs show's second hour of broadcasting in 2015, showing a trend for easier-to-access media for younger consumers. In February 2018, it was announced that WAMU, KPCC and WNYC had bought the archives of Gothamist, and WAMU would resume the publication of local Washington news site DCist in Spring 2018. WAMU relaunched DCist on June 11, 2018. WVAU The student-run WAMU carrier- current station continued operating on AM and in 1979 attempted to convert to a licensed FM station. To prepare for the move, the station rebranded as WVAU, \\"The Voice of American University.\\" WVAU did operate briefly on , using a series of experimental FM amplifiers designed to limit reception to the AU campus. It transitioned from carrier-current to cable FM in 1988 and shutdown in 1997, later resurfacing as an internet-only station in 2001. In 2014, WVAU was named best student-run, internet-only station by CMJ. Programming WAMU's main channel carries content from NPR, American Public Media, Public Radio International, and Public Radio Exchange. The station's weekday schedule is largely made up of NPR staples Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Here and Now, and Fresh Air. Locally-produced daily programs include The Kojo Nnamdi Show and 1A, the latter of which NPR also distributes nationally. The station also airs This American Life. A relay of the BBC World Service is heard overnight and in the 9 a.m. slot on weekdays. WAMU breaks from its general all-news and talk schedule only on weekend nights, which it devotes to entertainment programming; Sunday nights are given to The Big Broadcast, which originated in 1964 as Recollections. This program, which airs for four hours, features rebroadcasts of drama, comedy, and variety shows from the \\"golden age of radio\\", including The Jack Benny Show, Dragnet, Gunsmoke, The Great Gildersleeve, Lux Radio Theater, and Philco Radio Time with Bing Crosby. Ed Walker, himself a storied Washington broadcaster, served as the program's host from 1990 to 2015. On Saturdays, the station broadcasts Hot Jazz Saturday Night, which features popular music from the swing era and debuted in 1980. The show, which became a Saturday night staple with a loyal audience over the years, was first cancelled in 2018. Amid listener protests, WAMU management stated at that time that music was increasingly becoming out of place on the station's schedule, and cited listener surveys showing a desire for more news programming on weekends; after this change, a delayed broadcast of Live from Here was the only remaining music program on WAMU's schedule. After the cancellation of Live From Here returned two open hours in the Saturday night schedule, WAMU returned Hot Jazz Saturday Night in September 2020. Bluegrass Country WAMU's HD2 subchannel broadcasts bluegrass music under the branding Bluegrass Country. Bluegrass has a long history on WAMU, which included regular bluegrass programming on its main channel from 1967 to 2007. In 2001, WAMU launched Bluegrass Country as an internet stream, and in 2007 it launched Bluegrass Country on WAMU-HD2 as an all-bluegrass HD Radio digital subchannel. In July 2016, WAMU announced it would shut down Bluegrass Country for financial reasons that December 31, unless it could find a buyer for the station and access to its HD2 channel. At the time, WAMU was losing $250,000 per year on the station. Listeners created the nonprofit Bluegrass Country Foundation, and after an extension of negotiations, the foundation took over operations in January 2017 at no cost. WAMU included access to its HD2 subchannel for at least two years. Bluegrass Country also aired on independently-owned translator W288BS (105.5 FM) from Reston, Virginia until June 2017, when the owner elected not to renew his contract with the channel and replaced it with Radio Sputnik. Programming on Bluegrass Country includes The Katy Daley Show, The Lee Michael Demsey Show, Stained Glass Bluegrass and The Ray Davis Show. Technical facilities In 2013, WAMU moved to a new studio facilty at 4401 Connecticut Ave. NW in the Forest Hills/Van Ness neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The facility was constructed with three broadcast studios, two news studios with dedicated control rooms, multiple editing suites, and a 90-seat black box theater capable of supporting broadcasts before a live studio audience. In total the five-floor WAMU media ceneter supports 21 brodcast and production studios and control rooms and a technical core, as well as 12 conference rooms and community spaces. The IP- based studio infrastrucure at the facility helped ensure WAMU staff could work remotely throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2019, the station launched a major tower renovation and antenna replacement project for its tower on the American University campus. The improvents were designed to improve reception in Northern Virginia and parts of Maryland. During the project, WAMU broadcast from an auxiliary site in Arlington, Virginia. The WAMU antenna also serves WTOP, WPFW, and WETA; the tower also hosts antennas for WPGC and WMMJ. Prior to the station's move to Connecticut Avenue, WAMU operated for about two decades from two floors of an office building in Tenleytown near the AU campus that at one point housed the East German embassy. Before that, the station was housed on the AU campus next to its tower.

The Augsburg Eiskanal is an artificial whitewater river in Augsburg, Germany, constructed as the canoe slalom venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics in nearby Munich. The first artificial whitewater course of its kind, it introduced the sport of canoe slalom (using decked canoes and kayaks) to the Olympic Games. However, because of the expense of building artificial rivers and supplying them with water, canoe slalom was missing from the next four Summer Olympics. It returned with the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, and has been featured in every Summer Olympics since then. The Eiskanal has thus served as the prototype for six Olympic whitewater venues, from 1992 through 2012, and for more than fifty training and competition facilities in eighteen countries (see list). Despite being the oldest, it is still one of the most widely used, hosting two World Championships and numerous World Cup races. It was a World Cup venue for all but four of the years 1990 through 2010, and it was so again in 2013 and 2014. The facility and its website are jointly managed by two clubs with headquarters in the boat house, Augsburger Kayak Club eV and Canoe Schwaben Augsburg. History The Eiskanal complex, showing the river, dam, power house, and whitewater course. The Hochablass (High Drain) dam on the north- flowing Lech river south of Augsburg dates back to 1647. It was most recently rebuilt in 1911-1912. The dam diverts river water into the Hauptstadtbach (Capital Creek) which branches into the many canals of the Augsburg Lech district as it flows through the town. In Medieval times, the canals were used for drinking water, water wheel operation, and sewage disposal. In 1875, in order to collect drinking water from the upstream end of the system, a water collection and filtration plant was built straddling a new bypass branch of Capital Creek, near the dam. (In 2007 it was decommissioned and converted into a waterworks museum and a small hydro power station.) The original channel became known as the Eiskanal (ice channel), since it was used to deflect floating ice away from the waterworks facility, protecting its equipment. By the 1950s, the Eiskanal was already in use as a canoe slalom venue, but its slope was much less than that of the mountain streams commonly used in the sport. When the 1972 Olympic Games were awarded to Munich, a plan was devised to create a much steeper artificial whitewater rapid by constructing a 300-meter-long channel connecting the Eiskanal section of Capital Creek directly back to the Lech river. The 1971 construction cost was 14.9 million Deutsche Marks, equivalent to $24.5 million US (2013). For the 1972 Olympics, this new channel was only the bottom half of a 660-meter race course; the top half was in the old Eiskanal, starting above the boat house near the dam. Since the standard length of a canoe slalom course was later reduced to 250 to 300 meters, major races are now held entirely within the 1971 channel. Nonetheless, the entire sports complex goes by the name Eiskanal.1 2 3 The term \\"Eiskanal\\" may also refer to a bobsled track made of ice. To prepare for the 1972 Olympics, East Germany's team constructed a secret copy of the Eiskanal on the Zwickau Mulde river in the Cainsdorf district of Zwickau. The training there, on the world's only other artificial rapid, was so successful that East German paddlers won all four Olympic gold medals in canoe slalom, the only time that has ever happened. The ruins of the long-abandoned, overgrown canal can still be seen in satellite photographs at . Design Using a technique which has never been duplicated, the streambed of the Eiskanal canoe slalom channel was made of sculpted concrete, with simulated boulders being an integral part of the uneven channel floor. This feature is easily seen in photographs of the channel without water. The shapes were planned using water flowing through a 25-meter-long scale model made of sheet metal. Most of the simulated boulders are attached to the channel walls, but two stand alone in the middle of the channel. Five barn-door water deflectors, hinged to the channel sides, can be swung in or out to change the water flow at those locations. An underwater weir at the top can be raised to block most or all of the flow into the slalom channel from Capital Creek. At the bottom, a stationary weir creates a take-out pool. A pedestrian bridge on top of the weir supports a strainer that keeps people and boats from washing over. The strainer is slanted toward the river so anything that washes against it is pushed up rather than down. Six names have been given to sections of the channel. Sections are named in these videos. The turbulent water between the first drop and the first rock island is called Waschmaschine, or Washing Machine. Where the channel narrows and drops at the pedestrian bridge is Bogenbr√ºcke, or Arch Bridge. It has a pair of hinged water deflectors to further narrow the channel, if desired. The rock island below the bridge is called Moby Dick, after the fictional whale. At the last of the hinged deflectors, on the left wall, the right half of the channel is a pour-over. The wave at the pour-over is called Korkenzieher, or Corkscrew. The turbulent right bend in the channel between there and the road bridge is Karussell, or Carousel. Another pour-over wave under the bridge, on the left side, is called Torpedowalze, or Torpedo Hole. After the road bridge, the course flattens out, and racers sprint to the finish line.

Louis-Lucien Klotz (11 January 1868 ‚Äì 15 June 1930) was a French journalist and politician. He was the French Minister of Finance during World War I. Early life Klotz was born in Paris to Alsatian Jewish parents. He was the nephew of Victor Klotz (1836‚Äì1906), a wealthy silk dealer. After completing his legal education, he enrolled as an advocate at the Cour d'Appel in Paris. In 1888, at the age of twenty, he founded Vie Franco-Russe, an illustrated paper intended to increase popular support for the Franco- Russian Alliance. In 1892 he became editor of Voltaire, and campaigned against the reactionary policy of Jules Ferry. In 1895, he founded Fran√ßais Quotidien, a patriotic daily paper devoted to national defense, into which Voltaire was later merged. Political career Klotz was an unsuccessful candidate for the National Assembly from his Paris district in the 1893 election. He ran for office and lost again a few years later. Then in the 1898 election, he ran for the Assembly from Montdidier as a Radical Socialist. This time, he was elected by an overwhelming majority. He retained this seat until 1925. He was noted for his industry as a deputy and in government posts. He served as president of the Customs Commission, then as Rapporteur General of the budget. He held the following prominent ministerial posts: * Minister of Finance, 3 November 1910 ‚Äì 2 March 1911, in the second government of Aristide Briand. * Minister of Finance, 27 June 1911 ‚Äì 22 March 1913, in Briand's third government. * Minister of the Interior, 22 March-8 December 1913, in the government of Louis Barthou. At this time, there were large protests and demonstrations against the \\"Three Years Law\\" for military conscription. * Minister of Finance, 12 September 1917 ‚Äì 20 January 1920, in the second government of Georges Clemenceau. He was responsible for negotiating reparations from Germany. His policy was characterised by his famous formula: \\"The Boche will pay!\\" Personal life In 1924, Klotz published his memoirs of this period, De La Guerre √† La Paix (From the War to the Peace). Klotz was a member of several civic and charitable societies, including the Society for the Defense of Children, the Prison Society and the Central Committee for Labour.Isidore Singer and Victor Rousseau Emanuel.

In 1929, he was convicted of passing bad checks and sentenced to imprisonment for two years. He died less than a year later. With no further hope of settlement, his creditors seized his Paris residence at 9 Rue de Tilsitt, which he had inherited from his brother.

Luck served with the 7th Panzer Division and 21st Panzer Division. Luck is author of the book Panzer Commander. Early life and interwar period Luck was born in Flensburg, into a Prussian family with old military roots. Luck's father, Otto von Luck, served in the Imperial German Navy and died during July 1918 of an influenza virus. His mother remarried a Reichsmarine Chaplain. In 1929, Luck joined the Reichswehr (army). Through the winter of 1931‚àí1932, Luck attended a nine-month course for officer cadets, led by then Captain Erwin Rommel, at the infantry school in Dresden. On 30 June 1934 Luck's unit took part in the Night of the Long Knives, arresting several Sturmabteilung (SA) members in Stettin. In 1939 Luck was posted to the 2nd Light Division, serving in its armoured reconnaissance battalion. World War II=Invasions of Poland and France Motorcycle reconnaissance forces in Poland, September, 1939 On 1 September 1939 the 2nd Light Division, under General Georg Stumme, participated in the invasion of Poland. Luck served as a company commander in the division's reconnaissance battalion. The division was reorganized and reequipped to form the 7th Panzer Division, with Rommel assuming command on 6 February 1940. Luck served as a company commander in an armoured reconnaissance battalion. The 7th Panzer Division was a part of the XV Army Corps under General Hermann Hoth in Army Group A. On 10 May 1940 the division participated in the invasion of France. Luck's reconnaissance battalion led the division's advance into Belgium, reaching the Meuse river in three days. In his memoir Luck describes the division's crossing of the Meuse and Rommel's active role in gaining the crossing. On 28 May, Luck was appointed commander of the reconnaissance battalion. Luck's unit advanced through Rouen, Fecamp, and Cherbourg. In February 1941 Rommel was replaced by General Freiherr von Funk, and in June Luck moved with his division to East Prussia in preparation for the invasion of the Soviet Union. Invasion of the Soviet Union Moscow-Volga Canal, just north of Moscow Luck was made Hauptmann and attached to 7th Panzer Division's headquarters staff. His division was a part of the 3rd Panzer Group of Army Group Center. In this capacity he participated in the Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. The 7th Panzer Division spearheaded the 3rd Panzer Group as it drove east and the capture of Vilnius in Lithuania, before driving on Minsk to form the northern inner encirclement arm of the Bialystok-Minsk pocket. Following the capture of Minsk the armored group continued east towards Vitebsk. At Vitebsk, Luck was assigned as commander of the division's reconnaissance battalion. The division participated in creating the large pocket around Smolensk, cutting the Smolensk‚ÄìMoscow road. Luck and his unit continued on towards Moscow. In his memoirs he describes the stiffening Soviet resistance and problems the German forces faced relating to weather and road conditions. Since November Rommel had requested Luck be transferred to Africa to take over command of one of his reconnaissance battalions. The transfer was approved in late January once the crisis of the Soviet winter offensive had passed. North Africa Luck was promoted to major, spending February and March 1942 on leave. Reporting back for duty on 1 April 1942, he reached Africa on 8 April and assumed command over the 3rd Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion of the 21st Panzer Division. Luck spent June to mid-September in Germany, recuperating from a combat wound. Returning to Africa, he resumed command of the 3rd reconnaissance battalion. On 23 October 1942 the British launched the attack of the Second Battle of El Alamein. The Axis position deteriorated leading to a retreat. Luck was one of Rommel's most experienced commanders, and he called upon Luck's reconnaissance battalion to screen his withdrawal. By December the Axis forces had retreated to Tripoli. On 6 May the forces in Africa surrendered, with more than 130,000 Germans taken prisoner. By that time Luck was in Germany. The Normandy invasion Map showing territory gained in Operations Atlantic and Goodwood After North Africa and leave in Berlin Luck was assigned in August 1943 as instructor at a panzer reconnaissance school in Paris, where his health and his love life improved. In March 1944 he was to be appointed as commander of a panzer regiment in the new Panzer Lehr Division in France under Fritz Bayerlein. However in mid-April he was told by Bayerlein that as Feuchtinger apparently had more influence at Headquarters he was to serve under Feuchtinger. Luck was assigned to the 21st Panzer Division, stationed in Brittany and commanded by Edgar Feuchtinger. In early May, Luck was placed in command of the 125th Panzer Grenadier Regiment. Luck's regiment was stationed at Vimont, southeast of Caen, with two companies of assault guns in support. On 6 June 1944 the invasion of Normandy started. During the night Luck was startled by the reports of paratroopers landing in his area, and establishing a bridgehead on the east side of the Orne River. Luck requested permission to attack, but Feuchtinger, the 21st Panzer Division's commander, refused to allow him to do so, citing strict orders not to engage in major operations unless cleared to do so by high command. Apart from an order at 4:30 a.m. directing other elements of the division to move against the paratroopers of the British 6th Airborne Division, the 21 Panzer Division remained mostly motionless. As the morning wore on, the defenders on the coast were smashed and the British beachheads secured. Around 10:30 a.m. General Erich Marcks, commander of the German LXXXIV Corps to which 21st Panzer Division was attached, ordered the entire 21st to leave a single company from the division's 22nd Panzer Regiment to deal with the paratroopers and move the rest of the division to attack the British forces advancing from the beachhead toward Caen. Feuchtinger finally ordered his division forward, leaving a company of panzers as ordered, but also leaving Luck's 125 Panzergrenadier Regiment. This order was later countermanded, this time from 7th Army, and only Luck's detachment was left to attack the paratroopers east of Orne. The confusion and inflexibility of the German command situation markedly delayed the German response. Nevertheless, at 1700 p.m. Luck attempted to break through to the Orne river bridges at B√©nouville with his armoured personnel carriers, but heavy fire from the warships supporting the British paratroopers, under Major John Howard, holding the bridges drove his forces back.Ambrose, D-Day Added to this, more British paratroopers landed in the rear area of the regiment, causing some of Luck's forces to fall back. On the morning of 9 June Luck's command was designated Kampfgruppe von Luck, and in addition to the elements of 125th Panzer Grenadier Regiment already under Luck's command it consisted of a battalion, three assault-gun batteries and one antitank company with 88mm guns. With this force Luck was tasked with assaulting the Orne bridges, and recapturing them from the British paratroopers. Starting one hour before dawn to avoid the worst of the British naval and aerial support, the Kampfgruppe advanced on the village of Ranville, dislodging the enemy there, but it could not penetrate the British lines to reach the bridges. The British paratroopers, reinforced by the British 51st (Highland) Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade, then attempted to advance around the eastern edge of Caen as the left side of an envelopment attack, but their efforts were thwarted by Luck's unit. Over the next several days Luck's group initiated what amounted to a spoiling attack, and tying up the British units. On 12 June Kampfgruppe von Luck engaged in the fighting for the village of Sainte-Honorine, lying on a hill overlooking the invasion beaches. The British forces east of the Orne were unable to move forward until 16 June. =Operation Goodwood= In the beginning of July, the area defended by Luck's Kampfgruppe came under the control of I SS Panzer Corps under the command of Obergruppenf√ºhrer Sepp Dietrich. Nearby was the Heavy Tank Battalion 503 equipped with one company of Tiger II tanks and two companies of Tiger I tanks. On 18 July, Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery launched Operation Goodwood; an operation aimed to wear down the German armoured forces in Normandy in addition to seizing territory, on the eastern flank of Caen, to the extent of the Bourgu√©bus‚ÄìVimont‚ÄìBretteville area. If successful, the British hoped to follow this limited attack by pushing reconnaissance forces south towards Falaise.Trew, p. 66Ellis, pp. 330‚Äì331 The offensive opened with a massive aerial bombardment, followed by artillery and naval gun fire, intended to suppress or destroy all defences in the path of the attack. During the morning, Luck had just returned from a three-day leave in Paris. Informed of the air raids, he moved forward to determine the exact situation and soon realized that a major offensive was underway. The air raid had neutralized the remnants of the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division, which held the front line, as well as elements of the 21st Panzer Division (in particular, elements of the 22nd Panzer Battalion and the 1st battery of Assault Gun Battalion 200) leaving a hole in the German defensive line. While elements of the advancing British 11th Armoured Division were held up in an engagement with self- propelled guns of the 200th Assault Gun Battalion, the 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry advanced past Cagny. As the regiment did, they came under heavy anti- tank fire resulting in the loss of four tanks.Dunphie, p. 74Trew, p. 80Napier, p. 249 After the war, Luck wrote that he was responsible for this barrage of anti-tank fire, saying that he used his sidearm to threaten a Luftwaffe officer into action, to fire upon the advancing tanks with 88 mm flak guns.Buckley (2013), p. 105 Luck's account has been widely repeated,D'Este, p. 375 although competing theories have also been suggested: The British 8 Corps history states that German anti-tank guns based in Soliers, which had escaped the aerial bombardment, were responsible.Jackson, p. 98 Ian Daglish, critical of Luck's account, stated \\"there turns out to be surprisingly little\\" evidence to support Luck's version of events, and that all accounts of 88 mm flak guns in Cagny being used in an anti-tank capacity \\"can be traced directly to Luck and no one else.\\" He further wrote that neither the commander of the 200th Assault Gun Battalion or the commander of Luftwaffe flak guns made any comment in regards to this action and that based on locations of flak positions, it was illogical for a heavy flak battery to have been located there.Daglish, pp. 255, 258‚Äì261 Daglish also wrote that Luck's account of the placement of the guns \\"is imprecise\\" and \\"expert analysis of aerial photographs of the area taken at midday ... reveals no trace of [the battery] nor of any towing vehicles or their distinctive tracks\\". Such weapons and vehicles \\"could not be hidden within a mere couple of hours of relocation\\".Daglish, p. 256 Daglish argued that Luck embellished his role during post-war official British tours of the battlefield, with his version of events eventually coming into question (off the record).Daglish, p. 258 Daglish wrote that elements of the 200th Assault Gun Battalion were in the area and that any number of German anti-tank guns could have fired on the 2nd Fife and Forfar and that 88 mm anti-tank guns were deployed to the Cagny area throughout the day.Daglish, pp. 260 186 John Buckley is also critical of Luck's account, and called it \\"colourful and enthralling\\". He argued that despite there being \\"no doubt that heavy anti- tank gunfire from in and around Cagny began to account for British tanks\\", no evidence that the Luftwaffe had guns in Cagny at the time given the dispositions of other Luftwaffe batteries. Buckley wrote that Luck had embroidered his role. Stephen Napier reassessed these criticisms of Luck's account. He wrote that \\"heavy anti-aircraft guns were located in the outlying villages of Caen\\" and \\"photographic evidence of the Luftwaffe batteries in the area exists\\", in addition the wreckage of three 88mm guns were found by the Guards division that afternoon in Cagny, which would corroborate Luck's claim to have ordered the destruction of the guns upon abandoning Cagny.Napier (2015), p. 250 Napier wrote that Luck's account of threatening a Luftwaffe officer is plausible given that \\"88mm anti-aircraft crews did not expect to become embroiled in fighting as per III Flak Korps policy, and their direct involvement occasionally took some persuasion.\\" Napier also asserts that the timeline of Luck's stated confrontation with the Luftwaffe battery commander, just after 09:00 hours, correlates with the losses the 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry at 09:30 hours since a \\"88mm flak battery would only need about 15 minutes to relocate a short distance\\".Napier (2015), p. 249 Napier further writes that the fact that two Tiger tanks were destroyed by German friendly fire \\"suggests the actions of an inexperienced Luftwaffe crew\\" unable to identify retreating German tanks. According to Napier the 75mm Pak 40 anti- tank guns were incapable of the clean armour penetrations found on the Tigers at that range and the only other alternative unit that could have engaged the British tanks was Becker's 4th Battery located in Le Mensnil Frementel. Napier notes \\"if this company did not move before 0930 hours, it would have been cut off when the leading tanks of the 29th brigade crossed the railway\\" and reasoned \\"since the battery \\"Was able to relocate successfully to just south of Four where it was in action for the rest of the day and so must have moved well before 0930 hours.\\" Napier stated that an officer of the 2nd Fife and Forfar wrote in his memoirs \\"of his surprise at seeing a German officer in dress uniform surveying the battlefield from Cagny\\". Napier concluded that Luck \\"correctly attributed credit where it was due and his only sin is the assumption of a mantle previously worn by Rommel who stopped the British tank attack at Arras in 1940 by ordering the 88mm flak guns to engage the ground targets of the British tank forces.\\"Napier (2015), p. 248-251 Luck spent the rest of the day using the resources he had to check the gaps in the line. In the afternoon, the first elements of the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler had moved up in support and the situation was somewhat stabilized. The following day, Luck's Kampfgruppe, supported by the armour of 1st SS, held the British in check, and launched counterattacks on the British flanks. The British attack ended on 20 July. In the evening, the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend relieved Luck's men. For his service during Operation Goodwood, Luck was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, and on 8 August, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. =The Falaise Pocket and Retreat to Germany= A week later, after a brief rest and refit, the 21st Panzer Division was sent to the Villers Bocage area south of Bayeux. On 26 July Panzer Lehr's lines were broken, and 21st Panzer Division reoriented themselves on this new threat. On 31 July General Patton's forces broke through at Avranches into open country. The German motorized forces were brought west to counterattack in an effort to cut the supply and communication lines of the advancing American forces, but the counterattack was known due to Ultra decrypts and the attacking formations were heavily shelled and bombarded, stopping the attack before it could jump off. Unable to check the advancing American armour, all the German divisions in Normandy were in danger of being encircled. Luck reached Falaise after two weeks of delaying action. On 17 August a British attack split the 21st Panzer Division, leaving half inside the now emerging Falaise Pocket, while Luck's command found itself on the outside. Kampfgruppe von Luck was now tasked with holding the Western end of the gap open, which it did until 21 August. About half of the 100,000 trapped troops managed to escape, though most of the heavy materiel and vehicles were destroyed in the pocket. A new threat was already emerging, with Patton threatening to create yet another pocket, south of the Seine River. Luck was put in command of the remains of 21st Panzer Division. =The Defense of Germany= On 9 September Luck's command reached Strasbourg, where it was attached to General Hasso von Manteuffel's Fifth Panzer Army. In January 1945, when the division was moved to the Oder front, the division took part in fighting along the Reitwein Spur. Luck surrendered to the Soviet forces while attempting a breakout from the Halbe pocket on April 27th 1945. After the war After the war Luck was interned at GUPVI forced labor camp 518/I in Tkibuli Georgia, a camp for POWs and internees, similar to a GULAG camp.Karner, Stefan, Im Archipel GUPVI.

Normative sentences imply \\"ought-to\\" types of statements and assertions, in distinction to sentences that provide \\"is\\" types of statements and assertions. Common normative sentences include commands, permissions, and prohibitions; common normative abstract concepts include sincerity, justification, and honesty. A popular account of norms describes them as reasons to take action, to believe, and to feel. Types of norms Orders and permissions express norms. Such norm sentences do not describe how the world is, they rather prescribe how the world should be. Imperative sentences are the most obvious way to express norms, but declarative sentences also may be norms, as is the case with laws or 'principles'. Generally, whether an expression is a norm depends on what the sentence intends to assert. For instance, a sentence of the form \\"All Ravens are Black\\" could on one account be taken as descriptive, in which case an instance of a white raven would contradict it, or alternatively \\"All Ravens are Black\\" could be interpreted as a norm, in which case it stands as a principle and definition, so 'a white raven' would then not be a raven. Those norms purporting to create obligations (or duties) and permissions are called deontic norms (see also deontic logic). The concept of deontic norm is already an extension of a previous concept of norm, which would only include imperatives, that is, norms purporting to create duties. The understanding that permissions are norms in the same way was an important step in ethics and philosophy of law. 339x339px In addition to deontic norms, many other varieties have been identified. For instance, some constitutions establish the national anthem. These norms do not directly create any duty or permission. They create a \\"national symbol\\". Other norms create nations themselves or political and administrative regions within a nation. The action orientation of such norms is less obvious than in the case of a command or permission, but is essential for understanding the relevance of issuing such norms: When a folk song becomes a \\"national anthem\\" the meaning of singing one and the same song changes; likewise, when a piece of land becomes an administrative region, this has legal consequences for many activities taking place on that territory; and without these consequences concerning action, the norms would be irrelevant. A more obviously action- oriented variety of such constitutive norms (as opposed to deontic or regulatory norms) establishes social institutions which give rise to new, previously inexistent types of actions or activities (a standard example is the institution of marriage without which \\"getting married\\" would not be a feasible action; another is the rules constituting a game: without the norms of soccer, there would not exist such an action as executing an indirect free kick). Any convention can create a norm, although the relation between both is not settled. There is a significant discussion about (legal) norms that give someone the power to create other norms. They are called power-conferring norms or norms of competence. Some authors argue that they are still deontic norms, while others argue for a close connection between them and institutional facts (see Raz 1975, Ruiter 1993). Linguistic conventions, for example, the convention in English that \\"cat\\" means cat or the convention in Portuguese that \\"gato\\" means cat, are among the most important norms. Games completely depend on norms. The fundamental norm of many games is the norm establishing who wins and loses. In other games, it is the norm establishing how to score points. Major characteristics One major characteristic of norms is that, unlike propositions, they are not descriptively true or false, since norms do not purport to describe anything, but to prescribe, create or change something. Some people say they are \\"prescriptively true\\" or false. Whereas the truth of a descriptive statement is purportedly based on its correspondence to reality, some philosophers, beginning with Aristotle, assert that the (prescriptive) truth of a prescriptive statement is based on its correspondence to right desire. Other philosophers maintain that norms are ultimately neither true or false, but only successful or unsuccessful (valid or invalid), as their propositional content obtains or not (see also John Searle and speech act). There is an important difference between norms and normative propositions, although they are often expressed by identical sentences. \\"You may go out\\" usually expresses a norm if it is uttered by the teacher to one of the students, but it usually expresses a normative proposition if it is uttered to one of the students by one of his or her classmates. Some ethical theories reject that there can be normative propositions, but these are accepted by cognitivism. One can also think of propositional norms; assertions and questions arguably express propositional norms (they set a proposition as asserted or questioned). Another purported feature of norms, it is often argued, is that they never regard only natural properties or entities. Norms always bring something artificial, conventional, institutional or \\"unworldly\\". This might be related to Hume's assertion that it is not possible to derive ought from is and to G.E. Moore's claim that there is a naturalistic fallacy when one tries to analyse \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" in terms of a natural concept. In aesthetics, it has also been argued that it is impossible to derive an aesthetical predicate from a non-aesthetical one. The acceptability of non-natural properties, however, is strongly debated in present-day philosophy. Some authors deny their existence, some others try to reduce them to natural ones, on which the former supervene. Other thinkers (Adler, 1986) assert that norms can be natural in a different sense than that of \\"corresponding to something proceeding from the object of the prescription as a strictly internal source of action\\". Rather, those who assert the existence of natural prescriptions say norms can suit a natural need on the part of the prescribed entity. More to the point, however, is the putting forward of the notion that just as descriptive statements being considered true are conditioned upon certain self-evident descriptive truths suiting the nature of reality (such as: it is impossible for the same thing to be and not be at the same time and in the same manner), a prescriptive truth can suit the nature of the will through the authority of it being based upon self-evident prescriptive truths (such as: one ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else). Recent works maintain that normativity has an important role in several different philosophical subjects, not only in ethics and philosophy of law (see Dancy, 2000).

He is married and lives in Florida, where he had worked as a court reporter. Writing career Palmer's first novel, Emergence, won the Compton Crook Award in 1985. It arose from a novella by the same title featured in the January 1981, issue of Analog. This was followed by the February 1983, Analog publication of the Seeking novella, which ultimately became part two of the novel. Thereafter the Emergence novella appeared in an anthology called Analog's Children of the Future. Both novellas also won reader's choice awards from Analog. Both were nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novella in their respective years, and the novel for Best Novel in 1985. A sequel to Emergence, Tracking, was serialized in three parts, beginning in the July/August 2008 issue of Analog. Tracking was continued in the September issue and concluded in the October issue of the magazine. His second novel, Threshold (), was published as the first book in the To Halt Armageddon trilogy in 1985. The \\"About the Author\\" section of Threshold states that David is \\"currently working on the sequel to Threshold, also to be published by Bantam\\", to be called Spƒìcial Education, which was eventually published in 2019 by Eric Flint's Ring of Fire Press. He stated in the afterword to the 1990 edition of Emergence that any future writing would depend upon his finances. Palmer has another completed but unpublished novel, Schr√∂dinger's Frisbee, which is not related to either of his first two novels. Wormhole Press had been indicated as a possible publisher for the new novels and for a reprinting of both Emergence and Threshold.

The station pronounces its call letters as \\"K-Dawn.\\" The station's studios are located in the unincorporated Clark County area of Spring Valley, while it transmits from a three-tower facility on Galleria Drive in Henderson. Programming is simulcast on 250-watt FM translator station K268CS at 101.5 MHz.Radio-Locator.com/K268CS KDWN airs a talk radio format. It runs several nationally syndicated conservative talk hosts, along with local shows, most of which are brokered programming. National hosts include Sean Hannity and Mark Levin. Other hours are devoted to money, health, real estate and sports. In most cases, the local hosts pay for their time on the air, and are permitted to run their own advertising. Most hours on weekdays begin with world and national news from Westwood One News. A local staff provides Nevada news, weather and traffic. KDWN also has a local news alliance with Channel 8 KLAS-TV, the CBS-TV Network affiliate in Las Vegas. KDWN broadcasts full-time with 50,000 watts, the highest power permitted for commercial AM stations in the U.S. A single tower is used during the day, beaming a non-directional signal that covers large slices of Nevada, California, Arizona and Utah. But because AM 720 is a clear-channel frequency reserved for Class A WGN in Chicago, KDWN must adjust its coverage at night. During this time, power is fed to all three towers in a directional pattern, nulled away from the East. Even with this restriction, its nighttime signal can be heard throughout most of the Western United States, north into Canada and south into Mexico.Radio-Locator.com/KDWN-AM KDWN broadcasts in the HD radio format. HD Radio Guide for Las Vegas KDWN is southern Nevada's primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System. History=From music station to talk radio KDWN first came on the air on April 7, 1975.Broadcasting Yearbook 1976 page C-122 It was founded by A.J. Williams and Jack Reeder. Williams owned KTYM-AM-FM in Inglewood, California and also owned KAIL TV in Fresno. Reeder was the chief engineer of AM 1110 KRLA. Reeder died, leaving his half of the station to Williams, who owned the station until his death in 2005.http://www.nevadabroadcasters.org/news/index.php?news=38 The station began by broadcasting a full service format of middle of the road music, news, sports and talk. The music format lasted longer on KDWN than on most AM radio stations of the day. In the 1970s, many AM stations were leaving music formats to FM, and switching over to talk programming. KDWN's transition from music to talk began slowly. In the late 1970s, KDWN aired a mix of music and some talk during the day. In January 1980, KDWN began broadcasting talk around the clock. KDWN was the top news/talk outlet in the Las Vegas radio market and won an award for its coverage of the 1980 MGM Grand Fire. Unlike most Las Vegas-area stations, KDWN remained locally owned even as most of its competitors were bought out by large radio corporations such as Clear Channel Communications and Infinity Broadcasting. The continuity of ownership kept a consistent style of station sound. The station continued to rely on experienced, yet older, hosts who may have had been with the station since it began broadcasting in the talk-radio format. The station did well in the ratings as one of the first generation of talk radio stations. Call screening was not used until recently. Art Bell and Rush Limbaugh Noted radio talk host Art Bell, after minor jobs at several California radio and TV stations, began hosting an all-night show on KDWN in 1983. KDWN had just been granted Federal Communications Commission permission to increase its nighttime power from 10,000 watts to 50,000 watts.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1984 page B-161 KDWN was now audible with a good radio between nighttime and dawn in Los Angeles, San Francisco and around the West Coast. So Bell called the show \\"West Coast AM\\" because it aired between 1 and 6 a.m. Pacific Time. Bell began by discussing mostly politics. But he increasingly added discussions of the paranormal and conspiracy theories to the program, resulting in increased ratings and national attention. The show got nationwide syndication in 1993, when it was renamed \\"Coast to Coast AM.\\" Bell did the show from the Plaza Hotel, where KDWN had studios. Later it moved to a studio in his home in nearby Pahrump, Nevada, in Nye County. Eventually KDWN, no longer in control of the program, decided not to continue carrying it in syndication and it was picked up by rival Las Vegas talk station AM 840 KXNT. KDWN was one of the first radio stations to carry Rush Limbaugh's nationally syndicated show in 1988. Limbaugh helped boost KDWN's midday ratings. But in 1996, with the rates to carry it increasing, KDWN decided not to renew the show. Like Coast to Coast AM, the Rush Limbaugh Show moved to 840 KXNT. KDWN produced and broadcast a local morning show, The Snoozebusters, from the early 1980s until 2006. It was hosted by Ken Stahl and Hart Kirsch. Beasley Broadcasting acquisition In March 2006, Beasley Broadcast Group announced plans to buy the station for $17 million. A Las Vegas newspaper reported a rumor that KDWN would change to an all-sports format, effective July 1, 2006, although the switch did not happen. Host Jim Dallas reported on Wake Up, America on July 21, 2006, that audience backlash against the change forced Beasley to retain the talk radio format. In the fall of 2006, Beasley introduced a morning drive time news and information show hosted by Heidi Harris, with the remainder of its weekday talk format consisting of nationally syndicated shows and local brokered programming. Harris' show was discontinued in the mid-2010s, with the nationally syndicated Laura Ingraham Show moved into the morning time slot. Harris had also been heard on KDWN from 1988 to 1998. In June, 2017, the Oakland Raiders, in preparation for their relocation to Las Vegas, announced that a two-year deal had been reached with the Beasley Broadcast Group to carry Raiders games on KDWN and FM sister station 102.7 KCYE, starting with the 2017 NFL season.https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/raiders-nfl/raiders- announce-las-vegas-tv-radio-partnerships/ In 2019, the team moved their broadcasts to KYMT.

Cyclogenesis is the development or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere (a low-pressure area). Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for at least three different processes, all of which result in the development of some sort of cyclone, and at any size from the microscale to the synoptic scale. * Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, developing a warm core. * Extratropical cyclones form as waves along weather fronts before occluding later in their life cycle as cold core cyclones. * Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. The process in which an extratropical cyclone undergoes a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure (24 millibars or more) in a 24-hour period is referred to as explosive cyclogenesis, and is usually present during the formation of a nor'easter. The anticyclonic equivalent, the process of formation of high pressure areas, is anticyclogenesis. The opposite of cyclogenesis is cyclolysis.  Meteorological scales  There are four main scales, or sizes of systems, dealt with in meteorology: the macroscale, the synoptic scale, the mesoscale, and the microscale. The macroscale deals with systems with global size, such as the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation. Synoptic scale systems cover a portion of a continent, such as extratropical cyclones, with dimensions of across. The mesoscale is the next smaller scale, and often is divided into two ranges: meso-alpha phenomena range from across (the realm of the tropical cyclone), while meso-beta phenomena range from across (the scale of the mesocyclone). The microscale is the smallest of the meteorological scales, with a size under (the scale of tornadoes and waterspouts).University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. Definition of Mesoscale. Retrieved on 2006-10-25. These horizontal dimensions are not rigid divisions but instead reflect typical sizes of phenomena having certain dynamic characteristics. For example, a system does not necessarily transition from meso-alpha to synoptic scale when its horizontal extent grows from .  Extratropical cyclones  The initial frontal wave (or low pressure area) forms at the location of the red dot on the image. It is usually perpendicular (at a right angle) to the leaf-like cloud formation (baroclinic leaf) seen on satellite during the early stage of cyclogenesis. The location of the axis of the upper level jet stream is in light blue.  Norwegian cyclone model  An upper level jet streak. DIV areas are regions of divergence aloft, which will lead to surface convergence and aid cyclogenesis. The Norwegian cyclone model is an idealized formation model of cold-core cyclonic storms developed by Norwegian meteorologists during the First World War. The main concept behind this model, relating to cyclogenesis, is that cyclones progress through a predictable evolution as they move up a frontal boundary, with the most mature cyclone near the northeast end of the front and the least mature near the tail end of the front.  Precursors for development  A preexisting frontal boundary, as defined in surface weather analysis, is required for the development of a mid-latitude cyclone. The cyclonic flow begins around a disturbed section of the stationary front due to an upper level disturbance, such as a short wave or an upper-level trough, near a favorable quadrant of the upper level jet.Carlyle H. Wash, Stacey H. Heikkinen, Chi-Sann Liou, and Wendell A. Nuss. A Rapid Cyclogenesis Event during GALE IOP 9. Retrieved on 2008-06-28. However, enhanced along-frontal stretching rates in the lower troposphere can suppress the growth of extratropical cyclones.  Vertical motion affecting development  Cyclogenesis can only occur when temperature decreases polewards (to the north, in the northern hemisphere), and pressure perturbation lines tilt westward with height. Cyclogenesis is most likely to occur in regions of cyclonic vorticity advection, downstream of a strong westerly jet. The combination of vorticity advection and thermal advection created by the temperature gradient and a low pressure center cause upward motion around the low. If the temperature gradient is strong enough, temperature advection will increase, driving more vertical motion. This increases the overall strength of the system. Shearwise updrafts are the most important factor in determining cyclonic growth and strength.  Modes of development  A surface low can have a variety of causes for forming. Topography can force a surface low to form when an existing baroclinic wave moves over a mountain barrier; this is known as \\"lee cyclogenesis\\" since the low forms on the leeward side of the mountains. Mesoscale convective systems can spawn surface lows which are initially warm core.Raymond D. Menard1, and J.M. Fritsch A Mesoscale Convective Complex-Generated Inertially Stable Warm Core Vortex The disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the front and the low will be positioned at the crest. Around the low, flow will become cyclonic, by definition. This rotational flow will push polar air equator-ward west of the low via its trailing cold front, and warmer air will push poleward low via the warm front. Usually the cold front will move at a quicker pace than the warm front and ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù with it due to the slow erosion of higher density airmass located out ahead of the cyclone and the higher density airmass sweeping in behind the cyclone, usually resulting in a narrowing warm sector. At this point an occluded front forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft, which is also known as a trowal (a trough of warm air aloft).St. Louis University What is a trowal? All developing low pressure areas share one important aspect, that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere. Such upward motions decrease the mass of local atmospheric columns of air, which lower surface pressure.  Maturity  Maturity is after the time of occlusion when the storm has completed strengthening and the cyclonic flow is at its most intense. Thereafter, the strength of the storm diminishes as the cyclone couples with the upper level trough or upper level low, becoming increasingly cold core. The spin-down of cyclones, also known as cyclolysis, can be understood from an energetics perspective. As occlusion occurs and the warm air mass is pushed upwards over a cold air airmass, the atmosphere becomes increasingly stable and the centre of gravity of the system lowers. As the occlusion process extends further down the warm front and away from the central low, more and more of the available potential energy of the system is exhausted. This potential energy sink creates a kinetic energy source which injects a final burst of energy into the storm's motions. After this process occurs, the growth period of the cyclone, or cyclogenesis, ends, and the low begins to spin down (fill) as more air is converging into the bottom of the cyclone than is being removed out the top since upper-level divergence has decreased. Occasionally, cyclogenesis will re-occur with occluded cyclones. When this happens a new low center will form on the triple-point (the point where the cold front, warm front, and occluded front meet). During triple-point cyclogenesis, the occluded parent low will fill as the secondary low deepens into the main weathermaker.

Image:Two Low Pressure Systems, Northeastern Pacific.jpgThis image illustrates the relative positions of two storm systems over the North-eastern Pacific.  Tropical cyclones  Tropical cyclones exist within a mesoscale alpha domain. As opposed to mid-latitude cyclogenesis, tropical cyclogenesis is driven by strong convection organised into a central core with no baroclinic zones, or fronts, extending through their center. Although the formation of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood, there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis: sea surface temperatures that are warm enough, atmospheric instability, high humidity in lower to middle levels of the troposphere, enough Coriolis force to develop a low pressure center, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. These warm core cyclones tend to form over the oceans between 10 and 30 degrees of the equator.  Mesocyclones  Mesocyclones range in size from mesoscale beta to microscale. The term mesocyclone is usually reserved for mid-level rotations within severe thunderstorms, and are warm core cyclones driven by latent heat of its associated thunderstorm activity. Tornadoes form in the warm sector of extratropical cyclones where a strong upper level jet stream exists. Mesocyclones are believed to form when strong changes of wind speed and/or direction with height (\\"wind shear\\") sets parts of the lower part of the atmosphere spinning in invisible tube-like rolls. The convective updraft of a thunderstorm is then thought to draw up this spinning air, tilting the rolls' orientation upward (from parallel to the ground to perpendicular) and causing the entire updraft to rotate as a vertical column. As the updraft rotates, it may form what is known as a wall cloud. The wall cloud is a spinning layer of clouds descending from the mesocyclone. The wall cloud tends to form closer to the center of the mesocyclone. The wall clouds do not necessarily need a mesocyclone to form and do not always rotate. As the wall cloud descends, a funnel-shaped cloud may form at its center. This is the first stage of tornado formation. The presence of a mesocyclone is believed to be a key factor in the formation of the strong tornadoes associated with severe thunderstorms. Image:Meso-1.svgVertical wind shear (red) sets air spinning (green). Image:Meso-2.svgThe updraft (blue) 'tips' the spinning air upright. Image:Meso-3.svgThe updraft then starts rotating.  Tornadoes  Tornadoes exist on the microscale or low end of the mesoscale gamma domain. The cycle begins when a strong thunderstorm develops a rotating mesocyclone a few miles up in the atmosphere, becoming a supercell. As rainfall in the storm increases, it drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it. As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating wall cloud. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.Storm Prediction Center. The Online Tornado FAQ. Retrieved on 2006-10-25.  Waterspouts  Waterspouts exist on the microscale. While some waterspouts are strong (tornadic) like their land-based counterparts, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments with little vertical wind shear along lines of convergence, such as land breezes, lines of frictional convergence from nearby landmasses, or surface troughs.Barry K. Choy and Scott M. Spratt. A WSR-88D Approach to Waterspout Forecasting. Retrieved on 2006-12-04. Their parent cloud can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as significant as a thunderstorm. Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal wind shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm. Weak tornadoes, known as landspouts, across eastern Colorado have been witnessed to develop in a similar manner.Barry K. Choy and Scott M. Spratt. Using the WSR-88D to Predict East Central Florida Waterspouts. Retrieved on 2006-10-25. An outbreak occurred in the Great Lakes in late September and early October 2003 along a lake effect band. September is the peak month of landspout and waterspout occurrence around Florida and for waterspout occurrence around the Great Lakes.

Old scrap vehicles are raced against one another, with the winner being the first to the checkered flag after a set number of laps. Contact to damage an opponent's car is permitted and encouraged within the formula, with cars progressively becoming more damaged throughout the meeting. Races are usually held at an oval or tri-oval circuits that are usually up to long, however on some occasions, races are held in a figure of eight configuration. Bangers are often confused with stock car racing, however there are big differences between the two, despite often racing at the same tracks. Vehicles Banger racing vehicles are normally scrap cars in varying states of disrepair. In modern bangers, there are different events held for different vehicle types. The most common type are 'Unlimited' bangers, where cars racing have no set engine size limit. Despite the high running costs, this is usually one of the most competitive classes and is favoured by most drivers because of the high speeds and car strengths. Fans often regard the unlimited class as the sport's pinnacle, with many big championship races being raced to unlimited class specs.Chris Burns' third generation Cadillac de Ville prior to a meeting at Wimbledon Stadium.The 'Under 2000cc' class is where cars have to have an engine under two litres in size, a formula that proves to be particularly popular with Ford variant cars such as the Mondeo and the Cougar. As these types of cars are used so often, some promotions have taken to limiting the 'Under 2000cc' class even more, by running races with additional car constraints that force drivers to use alternative vehicles to the favoured Fords. 'Under 1800cc-1300cc', also known as 'Domestic bangers', are another regular class of bangers seen in the UK, with the engine displacement cap varying on the track or promotion that is holding the event. The domestic class is most common in the 'Rookie' and 'Back to Basic' formats. 'Micros' are the smallest vehicle class used in the banger racing and usually feature cars such as the Ford Ka and the Nissan Micra, that are generally considered to be too small or uncompetitive to compete in the other classes. Micros have quickly become one of the most popular forms of banger racing, due to the cheap running and repair costs of the cars compared with the bigger machinery. Four-wheel drive cars cannot be raced in any of the above categories. The 'Unlimited' class has the main stipulation of the car being rear-wheel drive, unless the vehicle is of American origin. This ruling makes it quite flexible for drivers to choose an appropriate car to race in, however there are some car models which have been banned outright for their increased strength compared to other vehicles. This is mainly to keep competition fair and not to endanger drivers who may be racing in weaker cars. The SsangYong Rodius and the Chrysler Imperial are two of the most prominent to have been banned for these reasons. Many other banger classes exist, but many are only applied for special event meetings. Big or small van, HGV/coach/bus, 4X4/SUV, siamese/double-decker and classic car ('Pre' meeting) bangers are all classes that would incorporate vehicles one may not normally be allowed to race in the regular disciplines listed above. History and turnouts This Russian GAZ-12 ZIM was raced by Terry 'Zorba' Tsakistras at the Southern Banger Open, held at the Iwade oval in 1992. Banger racing is said to have started in the early 1960s after it was observed by a race promoter that crashes were among the most popular features of a race meeting. Drivers began turning out vehicles with very basic preparation - cars would have the windows removed but often whole interiors would be left inside. Safety regulations began to improve in the 1980s with bangers being prepared with compulsory 'H frame' roll cages, driver's door plates, and fuel tanks moved inside the car. The sport has become a leading formula in short oval racing in the UK and Ireland, regularly drawing large numbers of both competitors and spectators. As the sport's popularity exploded during the 1970s and 1980s, many venues began to host banger events, building a strong driver and fan base in the process. These tracks and promotions began to host championship events to find out their fastest and most talented drivers. PRI was the first promotion to do so, holding their first World Final in 1971 at Harringay Stadium. The Spedeworth Unlimited Banger World Final was another of these big championship events and is now the oldest championship event still running. The first title race was held in October 1974 at Wimbledon Stadium. Plough Lane was the venue for this annual event until 2007 when changes to London traffic laws meant it had to be relocated. From 2008 the meeting was relocated to Ipswich and has continued to thrive, attracting more drivers than the Wimbledon World Finals were able to facilitate. Simon Reed's Jaguar XJ6 racing at Wimbledon Stadium.Around the late 1980s and early 1990s, promoters began hosting 'open' meetings with significant prize funds and very little regarding car limitations; the first of these being held was Ringwood Raceway's 'British Open' and the Arena Essex 'Firecracker 500'. Meetings like these continued to grow over the coming years, producing more cars and attracting drivers from all over the UK and often overseas. The 'Firecracker' event held at Arena Essex was so popular that it became the venue's biggest meeting for fans and drivers alike, and was subsequently held every year until the stadium's closure in 2018. The peak number of cars to compete in one season was around 13,000 in 2003, of which around 9,500 were 'fresh' and had not been raced at any previous meetings. As for individual meetings, the largest turnouts vary depending on the banger class racing. Meetings with 200+ bangers in attendance would be considered some of the biggest in the sport's history.Rover' meeting at Ringwood Raceway. The largest accurate meeting turnout on record was the Spedeworth Unlimited National Banger World Final of 2017 in which 269 cars were in attendance. The 'Heavy Metal Classic' meetings hosted at Standlake, are the only ones to come close to this figure with a turnout of 266 at the 2005 running and 265 cars the following year, however both of these meetings consisted of 'Unlimited' and Under '1800cc' bangers.https://www.ovalbangerchat.co.uk/topic/212787-list-of-meetings-with- most-cars-attented/?tab=comments#comment-1906971 Banger team meetings have also become popular in recent times, producing turnouts of over 200 cars on some occasions. The Unlimited 'Icebreaker' meeting, held at Swaffham Raceway on 8 February 1998 drew 209 competitors. Not only was this event the first of its kind to break this barrier, but at the point of running, it was the largest accurate turnout on record. Since then, there have been many other team meetings that have produced 200+ turnouts. The biggest team meeting on record was the Unlimited teams event held at Oval Emmem in 2016, which produced a turnout of 240 cars, also making it the biggest turnout at any Dutch venue. Another turnout of significance in the sport is the 2013 Olly Moran Memorial weekend held at Arena Essex in 2013. This meeting holds the record for being the biggest 'one-make' turnout in the sport's history, as every driver in attendance had to race either a 'Mark I' or 'Mark II' variant of the Ford Granada. This meeting achieved a turnout of 232 over the two days, with the Sunday running of the event becoming one of the community's most highly regarded meetings. The final landmark meeting worth mention is the 2018 Stan Woods Memorial meeting which turned out a total of 192 cars. This meeting was special for the reason that the event consisted only of cars which started production before 1975, making it the largest ever classic car meeting turnout. What makes this meeting all the more special, is that the turnout grew each year from the creation of this event in 2012. The final running of this meeting in 2019 proved to be the exception, as it was the first time the meeting was held in wet weather, with the boggy conditions on and around the circuit turning many drivers and fans away. Racing Reliant Robins at Mendips Raceway Banger racing within the UK is usually held to one of three rule presets that consist of varying degrees of contact during races. 'National' banger racing is the only one which is full-contact. Drivers are allowed to pull off aggressive hits like 't-bones', 'head ons', 'follow ins' and 'jack ups' that are not allowed in other types of banger racing. Meetings held to National rulings are very popular and usually more destructive than any other. 'Rookie' banger racing is a format designed to prolong the life of driver's cars with limited contact between drivers. The idea was brought about in the mid-1990s for those wishing to race bangers across the course of a season on a small budget. The reduced costs and crashes mean it is a safer and less aggressive environment for drivers, but not as popular with fans. The 'Rookie' banger format is commonly seen as a stepping stone for drivers who are looking to step up to the 'National' banger scene, with many drivers stepping up or partaking in both throughout their careers. 'Back to Basic' banger racing is an emerging part of the banger world, that is growing in success and popularity by acting as an entry level way for fans to break into the sport. Racing is often held in the same style as the 'Rookie' banger division, but car preparation is scaled back, with drivers being able to leave in dashboards and on-key ignition, that would normally have to be removed. Drivers are also not allowed to protect their vehicles as much, with cars usually being stripped-down versions of how they appeared on the road. This is currently seen as the cheapest and easiest way to race bangers and harks back to the sport's roots of simple preparation and large grid sizes. A banger race is distinct from a demolition derby as the objective of the latter is not to turn laps, but to smash, destroy and ultimately immobilise all of the opposition, until only one vehicle is left. On occasions, though, the final event at a 'National' or 'Back to basic' Banger meeting may be a demolition derby where the cars that have raced compete to be the last one standing. At special events, caravans or small boats may be towed by racers during the demolition derby for added destruction during the event.Caravan racing at Mendips Raceway. At regular banger events, cars are gridded across the track, sometimes in a graded order of driver success, and then sent away to give a rolling start for the beginning of a race. Despite the racing element of the sport, the community often categorise drivers into two different groups. There are those who are regarded as 'rodders', a term derived from the Hot Rod formulas that also commonly race on short ovals. These drivers aim to win races by any means possible. There are also those who are known as 'wreckers' and compete with the intention of destroying their own and other racer's cars. Wreckers are often more popular with the crowd, although drivers who win races and qualify for the world final are also respected. Along with trophies for race winners and podium finishers, there are often trophies presented to the 'Best wrecker', 'Best entertainer' and 'Demolition derby winner', in order to attract drivers of both persuasions. Another trophy often given is a 'best car' award which is usually either given to the best-presented vehicle or the rarest car; with the latter being the subject of much controversy with classic car enthusiasts. In a banger race, yellow flags are used during the race to warn drivers that caution is required. Cars which stall or are stopped by opposing drivers are usually left on the course while the race continues. In recent times, drivers have been encouraged to remain inside a disabled car while the race continues, as this is adjudged to be the safest option. The largest association of European promoters has indeed mandated this, it is now a punishable offence to leave a car during 'green flags' unless deemed an emergency situation. If it is deemed necessary to move them or if a driver is in particular danger (including fire), a red flag may be used to stop the race. Races are then usually restarted when the situation has been cleared. Critics Some vehicle enthusiasts object to banger racing, claiming it is responsible for the destruction of classic cars and the reason why many models, such as the Austin Westminster, have become rare. The banger community maintain that a large percentage of vehicles raced are beyond restoration.

It is owned by Entercom, which took over after its merger with CBS Radio. KCBS shares its Battery Street studios with CBS owned-and-operated television station KPIX-TV 5. The transmitter site is located in Novato. Its programming is simulcast on co-owned 106.9 KFRC-FM plus that station's HD1 digital sub-channel.\\"HD Radio Guide: San Francisco, California\\" (hdradio.com) It is Northern California's primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System. KCBS operates with a transmitter output of 50,000 watts, and during the daytime can be regularly received as far north as Sacramento and Hopland and south as far as San Luis Obispo. In good conditions it is also heard as far north as Redding and south to Santa Maria. At night, the station employs a directional antenna, primarily sending its signal to the southeast, in order to protect CFZM in Toronto, the dominant Class A station on the 740 kHz clear-channel frequency. KCBS's nighttime signal is heard throughout California, including Los Angeles and San Diego, in addition to several western states, including Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Utah. On rare occasions \\"DXers\\" (hobbyists who listen for distant stations) have reported receiving KCBS across the Pacific Ocean, and in Hawaii and Alaska.Mariners have also reported hearing KCBS on Marine VHF radio channel 22 on incorrectly configured receivers: \\"Getting AM radio stations on VHF Radio\\" (forum thread), June 25, 2010 (sailnet.com) In addition to over-the-air broadcasts, KCBS audio is webcast with live streaming audio around the clock. The station's live stream was also available through TuneIn and most streaming audio apps until August 1, 2018, when it was pulled from all streaming media sources except the Radio.com mobile app where it is now available exclusively; in October 2019, it was one of the test stations for the app's new \\"Radio.com Rewind\\" feature, where the last 24 hours of KCBS programming can be accessed on-demand. History=Experimental years KCBS is considered to be among the first radio stations. It received its first broadcasting station license, as KQW in San Jose, in early December 1921. However, the original licensee, Charles Herrold, had begun making audio radio transmissions in 1909, as part of an experimental radio-telephone system, and KCBS has traditionally dated its founding to that year. Herrold's earliest radio work had been largely forgotten until 1959, when Gordon R. Greb's \\"The Golden Anniversary of Broadcasting\\" was published in the Journal of Broadcasting.\\"The Golden Anniversary of Broadcasting\\" by Gordon R. Greb, Journal of Broadcasting, Winter 1958-1959, pages 3-13. On January 1, 1909, Herrold opened the Herrold College of Wireless and Engineering, located in the Garden City Bank Building at 50 West San Fernando Street in San Jose. In order to promote the college, as well as provide practical experience for his students, a radio transmitter (then commonly known as \\"wireless telegraphy\\") with a large antenna was constructed atop the building. The earliest transmissions used spark-gap transmitters which could only transmit the dots-and-dashes of Morse code. Herrold was among the first to develop a radio transmitter that could also be used for audio transmissions. After limited success with an approach that used \\"high-frequency\\" sparks, he later began using a version of an \\"arc- transmitter\\" originally developed by Valdemar Poulsen.Charles Herrold, Inventor of Radio Broadcasting by Gordon Greb and Mike Adams, 2003, pages 82-84. Although his primary objective was to create a wireless telephone that could be commercialized for point-to-point use, beginning in July 1912 Herrold also began making regular weekly entertainment broadcasts, with the debut program featuring phonograph records supplied by the Wiley B. Allen company.\\"Will Give Concert by Wireless Telephone\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, July 21, 1912, page 27.\\"Musical Concert by Wireless Telephone\\", San Diego Union, July 23, 1912, page 19. Radio communication was initially unregulated in the United States, and at first Herrold used a variety of self-assigned identifiers for his station, including FN\\"FN\\" was the inverted initials of \\"National Fone\\". and SJN, plus, for audio transmissions, \\"San Jose calling\\". The Radio Act of 1912 established the licensing of stations through the U.S. Commerce Department, and in late 1915 Herrold was issued an Experimental Station License with the call sign 6XF.\\"Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, December 1915, page 2. The \\"6\\" in 6XF's call sign indicated that the station was located in the 6th Radio Inspection district, while the \\"X\\" specified that the station held an Experimental License. Although Herrold reported success in developing his system, his arc-transmitters were low- powered and would only work at wavelengths above 600 meters (frequencies below 500 kHz).Wireless Communications in the United States by Thorn L. Mayes, 1989, page 206. The concurrent development of vacuum-tube technology, which did not have the same limitations, started making arc technology obsolete. World War I In April 1917, with the entrance of the United States into World War I, the U.S. government took control of the entire radio industry, and it became illegal for private citizens to possess a working radio receiver. In addition, all civilian radio stations were ordered to be dismantled, so for the duration of the conflict Herrold left the airwaves. This wartime government ban on civilian stations was lifted effective October 1, 1919, and in early 1921 Herrold was reissued an Experimental license, again with the call sign 6XF.\\"Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 1, 1921, page 4. (He had previously been issued a license for a portable transmitter, with the call sign 6XE.)\\"Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1920, page 5. During the war impressive strides had been made in vacuum-tube transmitter and receiver design, and Herrold's arc-transmitters were no longer commercially competitive. In 1920 a number of radio stations in the San Francisco Bay area, employing vacuum-tube transmitters, began making regular entertainment broadcasts, most prominently the \\"California Theater\\" station, 6XC, set up by Lee de Forest, which began daily service around April 1920.\\"Radio Telephone Development in the West\\" by Harry Lubcke, Radio News, February 1922, page 702. After the war Herrold needed to become familiar with vacuum-tube equipment before he could return to the air. Although some of his co-workers later reported that he resumed regular broadcasts as early as 1919, the oldest documented report of his resumption of broadcasting, presumably over 6XF, dates to early May 1921, with the announcement that the school was inaugurating a Monday and Thursday night schedule consisting of records supplied by \\"J. A. Kerwin of 84 East Santa Clara street, dealer in phonographs\\".\\"Radio School Sends Jazz Music via Air\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, May 3, 1921, page 4. KQW (1921‚Äì1949) Effective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce issued a regulation that stations making broadcasts intended for the general public now had to hold a Limited Commercial license specifying operation on a wavelength of 360 or 485 meters,\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. and, on December 9, 1921, a broadcasting station authorization with the randomly assigned call letters of KQW was issued in Herrold's name.Limited Commercial license, serial #255, issued on December 8, 1921 for one year. This license specified operation on the common \\"entertainment\\" wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz), so KQW initially broadcast only during the hours assigned to it under a time-sharing agreement made with the other local broadcasting stations. Classifying stations according to when they first received a broadcasting authorization under the provisions of the December 1, 1921 regulations, KQW was tied for 6th in the state of California and 16th in the United States. It is the eighth oldest surviving radio station in the United States and tied for 2nd oldest in California, one day behind KWG in Stockton,Limited Commercial license, serial #245, issued on December 7, 1921 for one year to the Portable Wireless Telephone Company. and tied with KNX in Los Angeles.Limited Commercial license, serial #248, issued on December 8, 1921 for one year (as KGC) to the Electric Lighting Supply Company. It is also the oldest in the Bay Area; the next-oldest, KMKY in Oakland, was licensed as KLS on March 10, 1922. Operation of KQW was financed by the sale of radio equipment by the Herrold Radio Laboratory, but by 1925 the costs had grown. The station was transferred to the First Baptist Church of San Jose, with Herrold kept on as program director. In 1926, station manager James Hart bought KQW's license and facilities, eventually buying the station itself in 1930. From 1937 to 1941, KQW served as the San Jose network affiliate of the Don Lee Broadcasting System. During this time its owner was Julius Brunton & Sons, and the station's operations were co-located with KJBS at 1470 Pine Street in San Francisco. Until 1942, it operated as a service of the Pacific Agricultural Foundation to farmers in the Central Valley. In 1927, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was created to take over the regulation of U.S. radio stations, and it began a series of frequency shifts to coordinate station assignments. Effective November 11, 1928, the FRC divided the AM band transmitting frequencies into three classification: Local, Regional, and Clear Channel. KQW's assignment, 1010 kHz, which it had been using since the previous year, was designated a regional frequency.\\"Broadcasting Stations Alphabetically by States and Cities: Effective June 15, 1927\\", Radio Service Bulletin, May 31, 1927, page 5. By 1940, KQW had increased its daytime power to the maximum permitted for regional stations, 5,000 watts. In March, 1941, under the provisions of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), most U.S. radio stations were shifted to new dial positions, so KQW moved to 740.\\"Your Radio Stations Have New Homes\\", San Francisco Chronicle, March 29, 1941, page 7. Under the NARBA provisions, 740 was a Canadian Clear channel, with CBL (740 AM) (since transferred to FM; the frequency now is utilized by CFZM using the same technical perimeters) as the frequency's Class I-A primary station. KQW was classified as a Class II secondary station. However, the great distance between the two stations meant that, with the use of a directional antenna, KQW could apply for permission to increase its power to 50,000 watts. In the early 1940s, the San Francisco Bay area affiliate for the CBS radio network was KSFO, which, because it operated on a regional frequency, was limited to a power of 5,000 watts. CBS wanted to have a station operating at a full 50,000 watts, and an agreement was initially made for KQW and KSFO to swap frequencies ‚Äî KSFO to 740 and KQW to 560 ‚Äî after which KSFO would upgrade to 50,000 watts. However, this plan fell through because CBS also wanted to own the Bay Area affiliate, and the owners of KSFO were not willing to sell. Due to this rebuff, in 1942 CBS transferred its affiliation from KSFO to KQW, with an option to eventually purchase KQW.KSFO's owner, Associated Broadcasters, had decided to concentrate on plans for its new television station, KPIX-TV. As compensation for allowing KQW to remain on 740, KPIX received the Bay Area's CBS television affiliation. The station staff moved to a CBS-owned studio located at the Palace Hotel. For all intents and purposes, it was now a San Francisco station. However, it was still licensed to San Jose, so an announcer was posted at the transmitter site to provide the required \\"KQW, San Jose\\" legal IDs. The beginning of KCBS (1949‚Äì1995) CBS exercised its option to buy KQW in 1949, changing the station's call letters to KCBS.This use of the KCBS callsign predates its use in Los Angeles by KCBS-TV (formerly KTSL and KNXT) and KCBS-FM by more than 30 years. In 1951, KCBS signed on for the first time from the four-tower 50,000-watt facility at Novato that had originally been intended for KSFO. KCBS's city of licence was also officially changed from San Jose to San Francisco. In 1968, KCBS became one of the first all-news stations in the country, as CBS was converting many of its radio stations nationwide to the format, developed at WCBS in New York City. KCBS already had a long history in news dating back to World War II, when it was the center of CBS' newsgathering efforts in the Pacific Theater. In 1971, KCBS moved its studios to the 32nd floor of One Embarcadero Center. Notable anchors and reporters who became popular during the early \\"Newsradio\\" era included Al Hart, Frank Knight, Dave McElhatton (whose KCBS tenure dated to the early 1950s, including hosting a popular morning show on the station before the all-news format was implemented; McElhatton moved to KPIX-TV in 1977, where he was a highly popular and trusted lead anchorman until his retirement in 2000), Ray Hutchinson (KCBS' first business anchor under the all-news format, delivering his updates from the floor of the Pacific Stock Exchange), Ken Ackerman (who began on the station in 1942, later hosting KCBS' version of Music 'Til Dawn and eventually becoming a news anchor under the all-news format, serving until his retirement in 1995), Bob Price, a longtime business anchor and editor for KCBS who worked for over 20 years at the radio station, anchored from the Pacific Stock Exchange until his retirement on November 5, 2009.\\"Business editor Bob Price retires from KCBS\\", San Francisco Press Club, November 5, 2009 (sfppc.blogspot.com) Throughout its early history, KCBS also broadcast local sports. As early as 1949, KCBS broadcast Stanford University football games. Upon converting to its all-news format in 1968, KCBS stopped broadcasting Stanford sports, whose broadcasts moved to rival KSFO. In 1985, KCBS signed a three-year contract to broadcast Stanford football and men's basketball. In 1992, Stanford dropped KCBS in favor of KFRC-AM in 1992 in order to find a station that would devote more airtime to discuss Stanford sports than KCBS could with its all-news format. From 1980 to 1986, KCBS broadcast San Jose State football. However, KCBS carried most San Jose State games on tape delay in the 1986 season due to conflicts with Stanford games. KCBS did not renew its contract with San Jose State after it expired, and San Jose station KHTT won San Jose State broadcast rights beginning in 1987. From 1981 to 1986, KCBS was the flagship station for the San Francisco 49ers. Common ownership with KPIX (1995‚Äì2017) KCBS logo from the late 1990s to 2005. In late November 1995, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation bought CBS, bringing the Bay Area's oldest radio station under common ownership with its oldest television station, KPIX-TV Channel 5, which Westinghouse had purchased from Associated Broadcasters in 1954. In May 2006, KCBS and KPIX-TV moved their news bureau in San Jose to the Fairmont Tower at 50 West San Fernando Street. This was, coincidentally, the location of Charles Herrold's original broadcasts. CBS management was unaware of the San Fernando Street address' history when the move was planned. However, once informed that this was the birthplace of KCBS, they recognized this at the bureau's opening celebration. Didot typeface; variants of this logo have been used since 2005. In mid- March 2005, KCBS, along with nearly all of the other all-news stations owned by Infinity Broadcasting (which renamed itself CBS Radio that fall), began streaming its audio over its website, reversing a long-standing Infinity Radio policy of not doing so.Press release from 2005 announcing launch of internet stream of CBS news radio stations (New York City's WCBS began streaming its programming online the previous December). Local commercials which are heard on the radio signal are replaced on the internet stream for nationally and regionally sponsored ads, a few public service announcements, station promos, promos of CBS Television shows, and repeats of pre-recorded feature segments already on the broadcast schedule (including StarDate and Science Today, produced by the University of California). In March 2010, KCBS and the other CBS Radio stations blocked Internet listeners outside the United States from accessing its live stream. In 2007, KCBS added an HD Radio digital sub- channel, and began identifying as \\"KCBS and KCBS-HD\\". On October 27, 2008, the station began simulcasting its full schedule over co-owned KFRC-FM (106.9) and that station's HD1 digital sub-channel. (KFRC-FM's previous \\"classic hits\\" format was moved to sub-channel HD2.) The stations' microphone flag now displays \\"740\\" on two sides of the cube, and \\"106.9\\" on the other two. In 2011 the stations adopted the joint branding of \\"KCBS All News 740 AM and 106.9 FM.\\" (KFRC-FM did not change its call letters because the KCBS-FM call sign was already in use by a CBS owned station in Los Angeles on 93.1 FM). In mid- September 2010, KCBS Radio's website was merged with that of KPIX and their sister radio properties in the San Francisco market under the \\"CBS San Francisco\\" banner. Sale to Entercom On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. While CBS shareholders retain a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity, separating KCBS radio from KPIX.\\"CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom\\" by Lance Venta, February 2, 2017 (radioinsight.com) The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. Beginning in the late summer of 2018, KCBS, as well as all Entercom-owned sister stations, began branding themselves on-air during the top-of-the-hour station identification as \\"a Radio.com station,\\" promoting the stations' Internet streaming platform acquired from CBS as part of the merger; the change of ownership separated KCBS-AM from KPIX-TV. Pioneer station status 1959 advertisement for KCBS promoting the station's 50th anniversary and claiming the title of \\"the first radio broadcasting station in the world\\". Pictured are Charles D. Herrold and his assistant Ray Newby, circa 1910.\\"KCBS: 50 Years of Broadcasting\\" (advertisement), Broadcasting magazine, April 6, 1959, pages 22-23 One of the conditions of Herrold's sale of KQW in 1925 was that the new owners include, in the sign-on announcement, the following: \\"This is KQW, pioneer broadcasting station of the world, founded by Dr. Charles D. Herrold in San Jose in 1909\\".Greb and Adams, page 129. Although there are reports that Herrold was making experimental audio transmissions as early as 1909, the best evidence is that it wasn't until July 1912 when he began making regularly scheduled broadcasts. These weekly programs are generally accepted as being the first regular entertainment broadcasts made by radio. More contentious is whether KCBS can be considered the oldest radio station in continuous service, due to the fact that, following the end of World War I, Herrold did not resume regular broadcasting until May 1921.\\"Broadcasting's Oldest Stations: An Examination of Four Claimants\\" by Joseph E. Baudino and John M. Kittross, Journal of Broadcasting, Winter 1977, page 71. (Other candidates for oldest U.S. radio station include 8MK / WWJ in Detroit, which began regular broadcasts in August 1920; WOC in Davenport, Iowa, which traces its origin to station 9BY, beginning regular broadcasts around September 1920; 9ZAF/KLZ in Denver, with nightly concerts beginning in October 1920; and 8ZZ/KDKA in Pittsburgh, which began operating on November 2, 1920.) In 1945, stations WWJ and KDKA held competing 25th anniversary celebrations, both claiming to be the oldest \\"commercial radio station.\\" Later that same year, KQW prepared and broadcast \\"The Story of KQW.\\"\\"The Story Of KQW\\" (November 10, 1945) Includes a link to a recording of the original broadcast (bayarearadio.com). The program made the claim that KCBS is the oldest radio station, predating by eleven years both WWJ and KDKA. This broadcast included a brief recorded statement by Herrold, made just before his 70th birthday. All three of these stations, WWJ, KDKA and KCBS, eventually came under the common ownership of CBS Radio and remain sister stations under the ownership of Entercom. In 2009, KCBS celebrated its 100th birthday, with a yearlong series of events throughout the Bay Area. Included was the public dedication of a plaque commemorating the \\"Centennial Celebration of the World's First Broadcasting Station.\\" This plaque is located outside the lobby at 50 Fairmont Plaza in San Jose, where Herrold's original broadcasts took place.KCBS Centennial Celebration During the year, KCBS adopted the slogan \\"The World's First Broadcasting Station\\". Programming Like most of its sister Entercom all-news stations, KCBS airs hourly CBS News Radio reports, including the CBS World News Roundup on weekdays at 7AM AND 4PM and the CBS News Weekend Roundup on Saturday and Sunday early mornings. It simulcasts the audio portion of the weekly CBS News TV programs 60 Minutes at 7pm Sunday and Face the Nation. Additional features include traffic, weather, sports updates, and \\"Bloomberg Moneywatch\\" business reports. KPIX-TV meteorologists provide weather forecasts, especially during AM and PM drive times. KCBS Cover Story airs weekly as an extended look at a major issue in the news, while In Depth is a weekly long-form interview program. KCBS also simulcasts a seven-minute block of the CBS Evening News East Coast feed live on weekdays, allowing listeners to hear the program's top stories two hours before the newscast airs on KPIX-TV. The station hosts special segments each weekday with CBS News technology analysts Larry Magid and Brian Cooley, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Phil Matier, and longtime food and wine editor Narsai David. KCBS will often feature live interviews with call-in guest experts (who occasionally also appear in the studio with the anchors) to briefly discuss a specific story, topic or subject; the edited comments are replayed as part of featured news stories throughout the remainder of the day. On weekday mornings, the morning team consists of longtime anchor Stan Bunger, Matt Bigler (who usually anchors from the San Jose news bureau) and Susan Leigh Taylor (Holly Quan is a fill-in for Taylor on occasion). Their program includes regular talks with former Oakland Raiders coach and sportscaster John Madden. Jason Brooks has served as anchor of business news segments.\\"Jason Brooks\\" biography, (kcbsradio.radio.com) In 2011, Kim Wonderley became morning traffic anchor at the station. A KCBS direct mail piece claimed, \\"More people rely on her morning traffic reports on KCBS than on any other station.\\" Mid-days are anchored by Rebecca Corral. On weekday afternoons, the anchor team consists of Jeff Bell and Patti Reising. Evening and night/early morning news anchors include John Evans, Peter Finch (no relation to the famous actor of the same name; formerly of KFOG and KGO) and Larry Chiaroni. KCBS often airs news reports of regional interest originating from Los Angeles sister station KNX. From 2018 until 2020, KCBS was the flagship station for the then Oakland Raiders (now Las Vegas Raiders) NFL broadcasts, replacing sister station 95.7 KGMZ-FM. In 2020, games moved to KSRO.

Originally formed in 1918, it served as a fighter squadron in the Second World War, flying Spitfires and Mustangs. It flew jet fighters as part of RAF Germany in the 1950s, and Bristol Sycamore helicopters in Northern Ireland before finally disbanding in 1962. Operational history=First World War The squadron was formed as No. 118 Squadron Royal Flying Corps at Catterick Airfield, North Yorkshire, on 1 January 1918 with the intention of becoming a night bomber unit. It received a mixture of aircraft for training, including Airco DH.6s, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s and Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2bs.Thomas Air Enthusiast January/February 1998, p. 64.Halley 1980, p. 153. The squadron moved to Netheravon on 15 April that year, and again to Bicester Airfield on 7 August, with the intention that it would receive Handley Page O/400 heavy bombers before moving to France.Delve 2006, p. 82. A change of plans meant that it would wait for Vickers Vimys instead of the O/400s, but the squadron received none before being disbanded on 7 September 1918. Second World War Supermarine Spitfire On 20 February 1941, No. 118 reformed at RAF Filton, near Bristol, as a No. 10 Group fighter squadron equipped with Supermarine Spitfire Mk.I fighters, soon supplementing them with Spitfire Mk.IIs. On 28 March, convoy patrols began and after moving to RAF Ibsley in April, it started to fly escort missions for anti-shipping strikes, as well as defensive patrols and fighter sweeps over northern France.Thomas Air Enthusiast January/February 1998, pp. 64‚Äì65. The squadron re-equipped with Spitfire Mk Vbs in September 1941, continuing to fly escort for anti-shipping strikes over the English Channel and for bombing raids. On 12 February it took part in the unsuccessful attempts to intercept the German battleships Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen when they sailed through the Channel, escorting bombers searching for the German squadron.Thomas Air Enthusiast January/February 1998, p. 65. In August 1942, the Ibsley-based fighter wing, including 118 Squadron, moved to RAF Tangmere to support the Dieppe Raid. The squadron flew four missions during the day of the raid, claiming two Dornier Do 217 bombers destroyed.Thomas Air Enthusiast January/February 1998, p.66. The squadron moved to RAF Zeals in Wiltshire on 24 August and to RAF Coltishall in East Anglia on 17 January 1943, operating over Belgium, the Netherlands and the North Sea. A major task was escorting the light bombers of No. 2 Group RAF on raids over the Netherlands, often encountering heavy German opposition. A particularly violent engagement took place on 3 May 1943, when the Spitfires of 118, 167 and 504 Squadrons escorted the Lockheed Venturas of No. 487 Squadron RNZAF on a raid against a power station in Amsterdam. The German defences had been alerted by a fighter sweep earlier that day, and the raid was met by over 70 German fighters. Although 118 Squadron claimed two Focke-Wulf Fw 190s for the loss of one Spitfire, the escort could not keep the German fighters from the bombers of 487 Squadron, all but one of the Venturas being shot down.Thomas Air Enthusiast January/February 1998, pp. 66‚Äì67.Richards 1995, pp. 240‚Äì241. The Squadron moved to RAF Peterhead in Aberdeenshire on 20 September to carry out defensive duties over northern Scotland, with a detachment at RAF Skeabrae in the Orkney Islands, moving to RAF Castletown in Caithness in October. In February 1944 the Squadron, by now equipped with more modern Spitfire IXs, moved to RAF Detling in Kent where it became part of Second TAF, but on 10 March it moved back to Skeabrae, remaining in Orkney for four months.Thomas Air Enthusiast January/February 1998, p. 68. It moved south again in July 1944, flying escort missions over Normandy from RAF Detling until August. The Squadron moved to RAF Westhampnett in Sussex at the end of August, and to RAF Manston in September, flying escort missions for Bomber Command's heavy bombers during daylight raids. The short range Spitfire was not ideal for the long-range escort missions now required, and in January 1945 the squadron, by now based at RAF Bentwaters, re-equipped with the longer-ranged North American Mustang, continuing these operations until the end of the war in Europe.Thomas Air Enthusiast January/February 1998, pp. 68‚Äì70. In all it claimed 29 enemy aircraft destroyed during the war, with a further nine probably destroyed and 27 damaged.Thomas Air Enthusiast January/February 1998, p.70. On 10 March 1946, the Squadron was disbanded. Post war operations - jets and helicopters The squadron again reformed as a fighter-bomber squadron serving in RAF Germany on 10 May 1951. It flew de Havilland Vampires out of RAF Fassberg in Lower Saxony, close to the border with East Germany. The Vampire was obsolete however, and in November 1953 the squadron received de Havilland Venoms. Even the Venom was outdated by 1955, and so the squadron discarded its Venoms in March that year when it moved to RAF Jever, operating swept-wing Hawker Hunters in the pure day-fighter role. It kept the Hunters until 22 August 1957 when it was disbanded as a result of the 1957 Defence Review.Thomas Air Enthusiast January/February 1998, p.71. On 1 September 1959, as a response to a campaign of attacks by the IRA, a detached Search and rescue flight of No. 228 Squadron at RAF Aldergrove equipped with three Bristol Sycamore helicopters was re-designated 118 Squadron on 1 September 1959. It flew its Sycamores in support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), carrying out short range transport and reconnaissance missions. Other duties of the squadron included experiments in traffic control.Rawlings 1982, p. 102. On 31 August 1962, with the threat from the IRA ended by a ceasefire, the Squadron was disbanded.

The main battle was at Uji, just outside Ky≈çto; this was the third battle to be fought there in less than half a century. It took place in 1221, that is, the third year of the J≈çky≈´ era. Background Retired Emperor Go- Toba, leader of the J≈çky≈´ War. In the beginning of the 13th century, Emperor Go-Toba found his attempts at political maneuvers blocked by the Kamakura shogunate. Seeking independence, and the power he considered rightfully his as the ruler of Japan, Go-Toba gathered allies in 1221, and planned to effect an overthrow of the shogunate. These allies consisted primarily of members of the Taira clan, and other enemies of the Minamoto, the victors in the Genpei War, and clan of the sh≈çguns. Accounts of the first Imperial banner appears in this period; and the very first is said to have been one that Go-Toba gave to a general during this war. Sun and moon images were embroidered or painted with gold or silver on a red brocade.National Archives of Japan: Boshinshoyo Kinki oyobi Gunki Shinzu, Imperial Standard during Boshin War (1868) -- commentary mentions 1st Imperial banner appears in J≈çky≈´ War. Provocation and attack In the fifth lunar month of 1221, the Retired Emperor Go-Toba decided on lines of succession, without consulting the shogunate. He then invited a great number of potential allies from amongst the eastern warriors of Kyoto to a great festival, thus revealing the loyalties of those who rejected the invitation. One important officer revealed his loyalty to the shogunate by doing so, and was killed. Several days later, the Imperial Court declared H≈çj≈ç Yoshitoki, the regent and representative of the shogunate, to be an outlaw, and three days later the entirety of eastern Japan had officially risen in rebellion. H≈çj≈ç Yoshitoki decided to launch an offensive against Go-Toba's forces in Kyoto, using much the same three-pronged strategy as was employed a few decades earlier. One came from the mountains, one from the north, and the third, commanded by Yoshitoki's son Yasutoki, approached via the T≈çkaid≈ç road. These forces faced meager opposition on their way to the capital; the Imperial commanders were simply outfought. When Go-Toba heard of this string of defeats, he left the city for Mount Hiei, where he asked for aid from the s≈çhei, the warrior monks of Mount Hiei. They declined, citing weakness, and Go-Toba returned to Kyoto. The remnants of the Imperial army fought their final stand at the bridge over the river Uji, where the opening battle of the Genpei War was fought, 41 years earlier. Yasutoki's cavalry pushed through, scattering the Imperial forces, and pressed on to Kyoto. The capital was taken by the Shogun's forces, and Go-Toba's rebellion was put to an end. Go-Toba was banished to the Oki Islands, from where he never returned. His sons were also banished, including Retired Emperor Tsuchimikado (to Tosa) and Retired Emperor Juntoku (to Sado), and the recently enthroned Emperor Ch≈´ky≈ç, the first son of Juntoku, was replaced with Emperor Go-Horikawa, a nephew of Go-Toba.

Fossil Receptaculites and Thalassinoides in Tyndall Stone. Tyndall Stone is a registered trademark name by Gillis Quarries Ltd. Tyndall Stone is a dolomitic limestone that is quarried from the Selkirk Member of the Ordovician Red River Formation in the vicinity of Garson and Tyndall, Manitoba, Canada. It is a cream-coloured limestone with a pervasive mottling of darker dolomite. The mottling gives the rock a tapestry- like effect, and it is popular for use as a building and ornamental stone.Glass, D.J. (editor) 1997. Lexicon of Canadian Stratigraphy, vol. 4, Western Canada including eastern British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba. Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Calgary, 1423 p. on CD-ROM. . Tyndall Stone is highly fossiliferous and the fossils contribute to its aesthetic appeal. It contains numerous fossil gastropods, brachiopods, cephalopods, trilobites, corals, stromatoporoids, and others. The mottling results from burrowing by marine creatures that occurred during and shortly after limestone deposition.Kendall, A.C. 1977. Origin of dolomite mottling in Ordovician limestones from Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Bulletin of Canadian Petroleum Geology, vol. 25, p. 480-504. The identity of the burrowing organisms is not known, but fossil burrows of this type have been given the name Thalassinoides. Tyndall Stone was first used in 1832 for building Lower Fort Garry, and has since become popular for building purposes throughout Canada and the United States. The Canadian Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, Ontario, the Saskatchewan Legislative Building in Regina, Saskatchewan, the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the Federal Public Building in Edmonton, Alberta, the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec, the Manitoba Legislative Building in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Empress Hotel in Victoria, British Columbia, les Apartements Le Chateau in Montreal, Quebec and many others include Tyndall Stone in their construction.

He is a companion of the Eighth Doctor. He is mentioned by the Eight Doctor in the mini-episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\". Overview C'rizz first appears in the play The Creed of the Kromon (2004), encountering the Doctor and Charley when they entered the Eutermes zone on Bortresoye. The Doctor had been exiled to Bortresoye's universe from his own. The Eutermesans are a race of reptilian humanoids, exoskeletal, with vestigial bone structures on their heads. They also have the ability to change their skin colour, blending, like chameleons, with their surroundings. The Eutermesans are the slave force of another race, the termite-like Kromon. When C'rizz meets the Doctor and Charley, he is suffering grief from the loss of his mate, L'da, whom he had left behind when he escaped the Kromon biodome. Together with the Doctor and Charley, he returns to rescue L'da and free his people from the Kromon. He succeeds in the latter, but is forced to kill L'da, who had been transformed into a Kromon queen. Still coming to terms with what he had to do, he asks to join the Doctor and Charley as they proceeded to the next zone in search of the TARDIS and the answer to the mysteries of the universe they were in. Eventually, it is revealed that C'rizz was an adept of the Church of the Foundation, which believed that all things must die, and had murdered in its name before he met L'da and left the Church. It is also revealed that the Eutermesans are more than physical chameleons, but emotional and mental ones as well, shaping their personalities to those around them but also making them easily manipulated. When the Doctor and Charley finally manage to return to their own universe, C'rizz continues to travel with them. In Absolution, C'rizz is granted massive psychic powers on a planet that resembles Hell, eventually transforming into a physical form that Charley likens to Lucifer. The Doctor theorizes that the Eutermesans genetically engineered C'rizz to house their souls in some mad bid for immortality. C'rizz eventually gives up his new form and powers by restoring the planet and its citizens back to their original forms. This action exhausts C'rizz, who then thanks the Doctor for healing his emotional wounds (save for L'da's death) and calls Charley his sister before dying. Before regenerating into the War Doctor in \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", the Eighth Doctor mentions C'rizz, marking the first time that any of the Big Finish audio series has been directly referenced in the television show.

The Roman monuments of his native town very early attracted Gaston Boissier to the study of ancient history. He made epigraphy his particular theme, and at the age of twenty-three became a professor of rhetoric at the University of Angoul√™me, where he lived and worked for ten years without further ambition. A travelling inspector of the university, however, happened to hear him lecture, and Boissier was called to Paris to be professor at the Lyc√©e Charlemagne. He began his literary career by a thesis on the poet Attius (1857) and a study on the life and work of Marcus Terentius Varro (1861). In 1861 he was made professor of Latin oratory at the Coll√®ge de France, and he became an active contributor to the Revue des deux mondes. In 1865 he published Cic√©ron et ses amis (Eng. trans. by AD Jones, 1897), which has enjoyed a success such as rarely falls to the lot of a work of erudition. In studying the manners of ancient Rome, Boissier had learned to re-create its society and to reproduce its characteristics with exquisite vivacity. In 1874 he published La Religion romaine d'Auguste aux Antonins (2 vols.), in which he analysed the great religious movement of antiquity that preceded the acceptance of Christianity. In L'Opposition sous les C√©sars (1875) he drew a remarkable picture of the political decadence of Rome under the early successors of Augustus. By this time Boissier had drawn to himself the universal respect of scholars and men of letters, and on the death of HJG Patin, the author of √âtudes sur les tragiques grecs, in 1876, he was elected a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, of which he was appointed perpetual secretary in 1895. His later works include Promenades arch√©ologiques: Rome et Pompei (1880; second series, 1886); L'Afrique romaine, promenades arch√©ologiques (1901); La Fin du paganisme (2 vols, 1891); La Conjuration de Catilina (1905); Tacite (1903, Eng, trans. by WG Hutchison, 1906).

He writes a twice-weekly column for the Daily Mail. Littlejohn has been a columnist for The Sun and has written for The Spectator and the London Evening Standard. Littlejohn earned a place in the inaugural Press Gazette Newspaper Hall of Fame as one of the most influential journalists of the past 40 years. He has been criticised for insufficient fact checking and for alleged homophobia. Primarily a newspaper journalist, Littlejohn has also presented numerous radio and TV shows and has authored or co-authored several books. Early life Littlejohn was born in Ilford, Essex in 1954. His family moved to Peterborough when he was five. His father worked as a policeman and later as a manager for British Rail. Littlejohn attended West Town Primary School where he passed the eleven-plus, obtaining the highest marks in his year. He was offered a public school scholarship which he turned down because the school did not play football, and subsequently attended Deacons Grammar School. Journalism At 16, Littlejohn found employment as a trainee journalist in Peterborough. He worked for local newspapers during the early 1970s. In the mid-1970s, he joined the Birmingham Evening Mail as an industrial correspondent. He worked at the London newspaper the Evening Standard from 1979 to 1989, initially as industrial editor, later a feature writer, then in 1988 as a columnist. While industrial editor in the early 1980s he was asked to stand as a Labour Party candidate, which he declined.David Rowan: The Times: Interview ‚Äì Richard Littlejohn Sky/The Sun In 1989, he joined The Sun as a columnist, which attracted controversy, and he was voted \\"Irritant of the Year\\" at the 1992 What The Papers Say Awards. In March 1993 he gave his support to the \\"Save the New Statesman fund\\" to raise cash to contest libel suits served on the magazine by the then Prime Minister John Major and caterer Claire Latimer. In 1994, he left The Sun to write for the Daily Mail, contributing columns on news and current affairs (in a similar format to his Sun column), and one on sport. His Mail columns earned him the title \\"Columnist of the Year\\" at the 1997 British Press Awards. In February 1998, Littlejohn became the UK's best-paid columnist when he returned to The Sun to write a twice-weekly column as part of a ¬£1million deal, which also included presenting for BSkyB. In May 2005, the Mail announced that he was rejoining the paper in a move that Mail editor Paul Dacre described as \\"returning to his spiritual home\\". The Sun sought an injunction to prevent Littlejohn writing for the Mail before his existing contract with them ended in February 2006, but the matter was later settled out of court and Littlejohn began writing for the Mail in December 2005. In addition to regular columns, Littlejohn has contributed articles to The Spectator and Punch. One of Littlejohn's Sun columns ‚Äì a 2004 skit, entitled \\"Rum, Sodomy and the Lifejacket\\", in which Lord Nelson is confronted with political correctness, compensation culture and the nanny state ‚Äì has been published in newspapers, magazines, and websites with Littlejohn's writing credit removed.Is Littlejohn's Column Turning Into A Saga? , Press Gazette, 3 June 2005 Death of Lucy Meadows In December 2012, Littlejohn wrote an article criticising the decision of Accrington teacher Lucy Meadows to return to the same school after undergoing Gender Reassignment Surgery. Littlejohn repeatedly misgendered Meadows and stated: \\"he's not only trapped in the wrong body, he's in the wrong job\\". In the same article he sympathised with those who were \\"trapped in a body of the wrong sex\\" and underwent gender reassignment operations, and expressed support for the operations being paid for by the NHS, provided it was for a genuine medical reason, but argued transgender people should not be teachers as it could upset children. In March 2013, Meadows was found dead with police reporting no suspicious circumstance, suggesting suicide. Littlejohn's article, which included a caption criticising the school for \\"burying\\" the news of Miss Meadows, was later removed from the Daily Mails website following Meadows' death, with an anonymously-authored obituary, repeatedly referring to Meadows as a man and making no mention of Littlejohn's article, appearing online and in print. Trans Media Watch, a charity for transgender people, said: \\"We have been deeply saddened to hear of the death of Lucy Meadows, who was outed by the press when she decided to transition.\\" A petition drive was launched demanding Littlejohn be sacked. Two petitions signed by over 240,000 people were handed over to the Daily Mail offices. At the inquest into her death on 28 May 2013, it was reported Meadows had contacted the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) over press harassment citing Littlejohn.[ Blackburn and Hyndburn Coroner Michael Singleton stated that press coverage of her gender reassignment was \\"ill informed bigotry\\" and that Littlejohn in his article had \\"carried out what can only be described as a character assassination, having sought to ridicule and humiliate Lucy Meadows and bring into question her right to pursue her career as a teacher\\".Huffington Post 28 May 2013 and The Guardian 28 May 2013 Asian hopscotch lessons In February 2011, Littlejohn wrote in his Daily Mail column that Haringey Council was using taxpayer funds for hopscotch lessons for Asian women. This was an urban myth first propagated in 1995 by the former Conservative Party chairman Brian Mawhinney, who took the name of the Hopscotch Asian Women's Centre literally. The centre offers \\"support services for Asian women and their families on a wide range of issues including domestic violence, benefits, housing, education, immigration and health matters [and provided] advocacy and support to people with learning disabilities\\". Jack Monroe Littlejohn was accused of taking insufficient care to check the facts before publishing an article critical of cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. Littlejohn suggested that Monroe, who prefers the singular they pronoun, chose to give up their job. Monroe's young son was unsettled with a range of different carers. As Monroe had grown up in a home with foster children, they are aware of the potential for harming him. Monroe tried unsuccessfully to negotiate flexible hours so they could work and look after their baby, but gave up their job so they could look after the child better. Littlejohn incorrectly suggested that Monroe was an unemployed welfare claimant. Attitude toward homosexuality In 2004, the Diary column of The Guardian newspaper documented the results of a \\"Littlejohn audit\\"‚Äîa count of the number of references Littlejohn makes to homosexuality in his columns. Marina Hyde of The Guardian noted in 2004: Littlejohn has said he is opposed to discrimination against homosexuals. In his Daily Mail column on 10 October 2007, he said, in reference to British society in the 1970s: \\"Though homosexuality wasn't exactly my idea of a night out, I thought it outrageous that gays were subjected to discrimination in areas such as employment, housing and pensions\\". Disabled protester In December 2010, Littlejohn satirised an incident in which a 20-year-old man with cerebral palsy, Jody McIntyre, complained of mistreatment by police at a protest. Littlejohn argued that the young man involved should not have attended the protest, and compared him to Andy Pipkin from Little Britain. This prompted 500 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission. Ethnic minority jobs In December 2012, the Daily Mail published an apology following a piece written by Littlejohn which suggested that ethnic minority staff had got their jobs through discrimination and had threatened to sue the Equality and Human Rights Commissions. An apology was appended to the online version of the article after the Daily Mail published an apology in the print version. Tom Daley On 15 February 2018, Littlejohn, writing for his Daily Mail column, focused on the news that Tom Daley and his husband Dustin Lance Black were expecting their first child. Littlejohn stated that while he supported fostered children being brought up by loving, gay partners, as opposed to living in state institutions, he nonetheless adhered to his belief that children \\"benefit most from being raised by a man and a woman\\". He also criticised that in many cases of male gay relationships, Daley and Black included, women were being seen as \\"mere breeding machines\\" (their baby's surrogate mother not having been identified) and that offspring were shown off like \\"commodities\\". Littlejohn came under widespread criticism for his comments, with many accusing him of homophobia. As a result, Center Parcs announced its decision to cease publication of its advertisements in the Daily Mail, with a number of other businesses also reviewing their decision to advertise in the newspaper. Radio By the end of the 1980s, Littlejohn was known in London for his Evening Standard columns, and was invited on to radio programmes as a pundit. From 1991, he worked for the London radio station LBC, beginning with a regular opinion spot. LBC later gave Littlejohn an early afternoon show, Littlejohn's Long Lunch; the programme was a talk show featuring topical discussion, phone-ins, and guests. He later became permanent presenter of the morning show, replacing Michael Parkinson. During his time at LBC, Littlejohn was censured by the Radio Authority for breaching broadcasting rules. This culminated in the Radio Authority stating that he \\"had broken half-a-dozen rules and had incited violence\\"Why I'll never give up the day job British Journalism Review, Vol. 13, No. 3, 2002, pages 65‚Äì70, \\"During one of the interminable age-of-consent debates, a gang of militant homosexuals kicked lumps out of a young police officer outside the Commons. I happened to remark on air that the police should have turned the flame throwers on them\\" due to an edition of his phone-in show in which he suggested the police should have used flamethrowers against a group of \\"militant homosexuals\\" protesting outside the House of Commons. On another LBC phone-in he was censured by the Radio Authority for describing the Royal Family as a \\"bunch of tax-evading adulterers\\".Why I'll never give up the day job British Journalism Review, Vol. 13, No. 3, 2002, pages 65‚Äì70, \\"Another censure arrived when I described the royals as 'a bunch of tax-evading adulterers'. Who, with hindsight, would argue with that?\\" He also deputised for Jimmy Young on BBC Radio 2 and hosted football phone-ins on BBC Radio 5 Live. Television After leaving LBC in 1994, Littlejohn was approached by BSkyB managing director (and former Sun editor) Kelvin MacKenzie, and was offered the chance to present a nightly current affairs show on the TV channel Sky News. Called Richard Littlejohn, the show ran for one year, but was not a success. Littlejohn expressed his disappointment, claiming that broadcasting regulations would not permit him to present the show in the style of Rush Limbaugh's programmes: \\"If Sky News could emulate its US sister Fox News... ratings would soon shoot past the Astra satellite. But the regulators won't allow it.\\" Later in 1994, Trevor Phillips of London Weekend Television hired Littlejohn to host a studio-based talk show entitled Richard Littlejohn Live And Uncut. Phillips produced three series of the programme, which was transmitted only in the London area. On Littlejohn's show of 8 July 1994, he was critical of two lesbians, one of whom was Linda Bellos. The film director Michael Winner, a guest on the show, attacked Littlejohn for his views and told him that the two women \\"have come across with considerable dignity and you have come across as an arsehole\\". Littlejohn hosted the first series of Channel 4's game show Wanted, as a stand-in for Bob Mills. Wanted aired in October 1996 and won a Silver Rose at the Festival Rose d'Or. As part of a 1997 deal, which saw him return to The Sun, Littlejohn hosted a nightly talk show on Sky One called Littlejohn: Live And Unleashed. In early 2003, he returned to Sky News to present Littlejohn, a live talk show initially broadcast twice weekly but later extended to four nights per week. The programme was dropped on 8 July 2004 when Sky News changed format and replaced it with regular rolling news. On 9 July 2007, Channel 4 showed a documentary entitled The War on Britain's Jews?, written and narrated by Littlejohn. Littlejohn has also appeared on BBC One's Question Time and Have I Got News for You. Books Littlejohn has authored or co-authored: * The Essex Girl Joke Book (1991, Corgi Publishing) ‚Äì a collection of Essex girl jokes, co- written (with \\"Brent Wood\\" {Mitchell Symons}) under the pseudonym \\"Ray Leigh\\". * You Couldn't Make It Up (1995, Heinemann, ) ‚Äì named after one of Littlejohn's catchphrases, and described on the jacket as \\"a brilliant collection of liberal-skewering wit and wisdom\\", this is a book of recollections and opinion pieces on subjects such as political correctness, politicians, corporate \\"fat cats\\", the European Union, and the British Royal Family. Anthony Daniels, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said: \\"...not only does he never mention foreigners in any but a derogatory way ‚Äì when he is far too intelligent a man really to believe that we have nothing to learn from any of them ‚Äì but when he writes of the Germans and the Japanese as having taken our cars and electronics industries he is pandering to the kind of stupid, ignorant, sentimental, self-pitying xenophobia which is the root of all fascism, and which is an obstacle to genuine self improvement.\\" The New Statesman wrote: \\"Not exactly New Statesman territory, but the pick of the best tabloid columnist in Britain is a joy from beginning to end. Hysterically funny, wonderfully politically incorrect, [...] the only writer in Britain to rival the best of the Americans.\\" * To Hell in a Handcart (2001, HarperCollins, ) ‚Äì named after another of his catchphrases, this is Littlejohn's only novel, based loosely on the Tony Martin case. The book was lambasted by critics for its portrayal of asylum seekers and the stereotypical individuals in the book, notably by The Independent's David Aaronovitch who described it as \\"a 400-page recruiting pamphlet for the British National Party\\". However, it received positive reviews from some conservative writers such as Frederick Forsyth and Andrew Roberts. This was later the subject of a BBC Radio Five Live discussion with Will Self.Self v Littlejohn BBC. 15 June 2001 * The Book of Useless Information (with Keith Waterhouse, 2002, John Blake Publishing, ) ‚Äì co-written with Keith Waterhouse, this \\"stocking filler\\" book is a collection of \\"useless\\" facts, described on the cover as \\"all you never needed to know and didn't need to ask\\". * The Ultimate Book of Useless Information (with Keith Waterhouse, 2004, John Blake Publishing, ) ‚Äì another volume of \\"useless\\" facts. * Littlejohn's Britain ‚Äì Publisher: Hutchinson (3 May 2007) ‚Äì described by The Observer as \\"lampooning New Labour with polemic, pastiche, parody, satire and savage social commentary\\". The New Statesman said of it: \\"Littlejohn's Britain doesn't exist. Literally. He spends much of the year writing from a gated mansion in Florida, and admitted in a recent column that, when he is in Britain, he rarely leaves the house. He is describing a country he sees only through the pages of the right-wing press and his self- reinforcing mailbag.\\" *Littlejohn's House of Fun: Thirteen Years of (Labour) Madness ‚Äì Publisher: Hutchinson (1 April 2010) ‚Äì Reviewing for The Daily Telegraph Roger Lewis said: \\"If you prize free expression, this book is essential reading.

Personal life Littlejohn is a keen football fan and since the late 1960s has been a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur. He has starred in his own football video, We Woz Robbed. He married Wendy A. Bosworth in 1974. They have two children: Georgina (born in 1975), also a journalist, and William (born in 1979), a chef.

He also held the positions of Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the United States.  Biographic data  Turbay was born in a rich neighborhood of ‚ÄúVoto Nacional‚Äù, Bogot√°, on June 18, 1916. His father, Antonio Am√≠n Turbay, was a businessman who emigrated from Tannourine, Lebanon.EFE, Julio C√©sar Turbay Ayala, ex presidente de Colombia, El Mundo, September 15, 2005 His mother, Rosaura Ayala, was a peasant from the province of Cundinamarca. Turbay‚Äôs father, a hard working merchant, had built a fortune, which he completely lost during the civil war of the Thousand Days War.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos; trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n; Page 249; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983 Turbay Ayala completed his secondary studies in Bogot√°, but never attended college, and instead became an autodidact, a fact that his political adversaries always poked fun at. He received a number of honorary degrees later in life.  Political career  Turbay started his political career in the Liberal Party as a councilman in the (then) town of Usme in 1936. He would later be appointed as major of the city of Girardot (1937), and then councilman in the town of Engativ√° in 1938 along with fellow politicians Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen and √Ålvaro G√≥mez Hurtado. The next few years he spent as a member of the Assembly of Cundinamarca. In 1943 he was chosen for congress as a Chamber Representative. He was a leader of the opposition to conservative governments, and in 1953 became a member of the national directive of the liberal party. With the rise to power of the military Junta that ousted dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, Turbay was appointed Minister of Mines and Petroleum. He was later appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs by president Alberto Lleras Camargo until 1961. He was known as a strong defender of the National Front, and was chosen as senator for four consecutive periods between 1962 and 1974. He also served briefly as interim president in 1967. He was also appointed as ambassador the UN (1967-1969), United Kingdom (1973-1974), and the United States (1975-1976). He first attempted to become a presidential candidate in 1974, but ended up supporting L√≥pez Michelsen, who won the elections that year. The sector supporting L√≥pez Michelsen was instrumental in Turbay's presidential campaign of 1978, and after a very narrow election he became president of Colombia in 1978. Presidency=1978 Security Statute In response to an increase in guerrilla activity from the 19th of April Movement (M-19) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, as well as to the Colombian Communist Party's attempts to extend its political influence and a 1977 national strike, a 1978 decree, known as the Security Statute, was implemented by Turbay's administration. The Security Statute gave the military an increased degree of freedom of action, especially in urban areas, to detain, interrogate and eventually judge suspected guerrillas or their collaborators before military tribunals. Human rights organizations, newspaper columnists, political personalities and opposition groups complained about an increase in the number of arbitrary detentions and acts of torture as a result. Although the Security Statute allegedly benefited some of the counterinsurgency operations of the security forces, such as the capture of most of the M-19's command structure and many of the guerrilla group's urban cells, the measure became highly unpopular inside and outside Colombia, promoting some measure of public sympathy for the victims of the real or perceived military abuses whether they were guerrillas or not, and was phased out towards the end of the Turbay administration. 1980 Dominican embassy crisis The M-19's late 1980 takeover of the Dominican Republic's embassy, during which sixteen ambassadors were held hostage for 61 days, presented a complicated challenge to the Turbay administration. The incident soon spread throughout worldwide headlines, as ambassadors from the United States of America, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, Israel and Venezuela had been taken hostage, as well as Colombia's top representative to the Holy See. Turbay, despite pressure from military and political sectors, avoided deciding to solve the crisis through the use of direct military force, and instead eventually agreed to let the M-19 rebels travel to Cuba. Allegedly, the rebels also received USD 1 million as payment, instead of the initial $50 million that they had originally demanded from the government. That a mostly peaceful resolution to the crisis was found has been generally considered as a positive aspect of Turbay's administration, as seen by later and contemporary commentators and historians. In particular, former M-19 members, including Rosemberg Pab√≥n, the commander of the guerrilla group's operative unit at the time, later recognized and respected Turbay's handling of the situation. Post-presidency Turbay was a supporter of president √Ålvaro Uribe. He initially opposed the possibility of presidential reelection in Colombia, but later changed his views, contributing to founding a movement known as Patria Nueva (\\"New Homeland\\"), in order to help promote Uribe's 2006 reelection aspirations.  Support for a prisoner exchange with the FARC  Turbay was seen as being at odds with some of Uribe's policies, however, in particular due to Turbay's activism in favor of the implementation and negotiation of a prisoner exchange with the FARC guerrilla group. As part of this effort, Turbay participated in several meetings with the relatives of FARC hostages and signed several declarations of support, together with other former presidents such as Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen and Ernesto Samper Pizano. On August 31, 2005, Turbay proposed that the government could exchange each jailed guerrilla for 10 \\"economic\\" hostages (those held for extortion purposes) and one \\"political\\" hostage (those held by the FARC in order to pressure the Colombian government to release its jailed members).  Personal life  Turbay married his niece, Nydia Quintero Turbay, on July 1, 1948. They had four children together: Julio C√©sar, Diana, Claudia, and Mar√≠a Victoria. However, their marriage was annulled by the Roman Catholic Church, and in 1986 he married his longtime companion Amparo Canal, to whom he remained married until his death. He is related to Paola Turbay. In January 1991, Turbay's daughter, the journalist Diana Turbay, was kidnapped by orders of the Medell√≠n Cartel and died during a failed police rescue operation not sanctioned by her family. Her kidnapping is chronicled in News of a Kidnapping by the Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez (1996) and depicted in multiple onscreen productions. A personal idiosyncrasy of Turbay's was his custom of wearing bow ties, a sartorial habit extremely uncommon in Colombia.  Death  Turbay died on 13 September 2005, at the age of 89. He was honored by a state funeral personally led by President √Ålvaro Uribe and was buried at the Sacromonte Caves at Canton Norte, an army base in Bogot√°.. He visited Lebanon with his family in 2003 as a final trip to the homeland of his family.

He was nicknamed \\"El Pollo\\" (The Chicken), a popular Colombian idiom for people with precocious careers. Early years L√≥pez was the son of former two-time president of Colombia, Alfonso L√≥pez Pumarejo. He was born and raised in Bogot√°. He studied at the Gimnasio Moderno School and later in other cities: Paris, Brussels, London and Santiago de Chile. He graduated with a degree in law from the Universidad del Rosario. During his father's presidency, L√≥pez maintained a low profile in politics and instead focused on becoming a university professor at the Universidad del Rosario.http://www.elespectador.com/elespectador/Secciones/Detalles.aspx?idNoticia=12208&idSeccion;=21 In 1938, L√≥pez married Cecilia Caballero Blanco in Bogot√°. They moved to the outskirts of Bogot√° in a hacienda in the then municipality of Engativ√°, Cundinamarca Department (nowadays a Locality of Bogot√°). Settled in this town, L√≥pez had his first experience with politics becoming a town councilman. During this time, his fellow councilmen included two other politicians who went to become key political players in the country, √Ålvaro G√≥mez Hurtado and future president Julio C√©sar Turbay Ayala. Political career In 1959, a group of his former college students founded the Liberal Revolutionary Movement (MRL) as a reaction against the pact between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party to create the National Front, in which the two parties took turns to govern. L√≥pez Michelsen was then offered the leadership of the newly created MRL and he accepted, becoming a presidential candidate for the 1962 presidential elections. L√≥pez lost the election by a large margin to Conservative candidate Guillermo Le√≥n Valencia. Governor of the Department of Cesar (1967‚Äì1968) In 1966, L√≥pez was elected as a senator and negotiated the return of the MRL to the Liberal Party in 1967. This same year L√≥pez traveled to the city of Valledupar after being appointed by President Carlos Lleras Restrepo as the first governor of Cesar Department, a newly created province in the northern Caribbean Region of Colombia. L√≥pez was able to trace his grandmothers' family ancestors \\"the Pumarejos,\\" back to this town. During those years, he was also instrumental for the creation of the Vallenato Legend Festival (nowadays, one of the most important cultural events in Colombia) along with vallenato composer Rafael Escalona and journalist Consuelo Ara√∫jo. He served as governor of Cesar from December 21, 1967, until August 14, 1968. =Cabinet= *Secretary of Government: Luis Roberto Garc√≠a *Secretary of Development: Alvaro Pupo Pupo *Administrative Office Chief: Alvaro Araujo Noguera *Chief of Planning: Jorge Chaild Velez *Chief of Education: Cesar Fernandez Dager *Chief of Agricultural Sector: Hernan Osorio *Chief of Public Works: Emiro Alfonso Zuleta *Chief of Budget and Accountability: Teobaldo Manjarrez *Chief of General Services: Damazo Lora *Chief of Personnel: Jorge Gomez *Chief of Judicial Bureau: Uribe Habid Molina *Administrator of Rents: Diomedes Daza Daza *Private Secretary: Cesar Escobar Ortega *Chief of Public Relations: Rafael Escalona Minister of Foreign Affairs A year later, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs until the end of the presidential term of President Carlos Lleras Restrepo in 1970. Presidency (1974‚Äì1978) In 1974, L√≥pez was chosen by the Liberal Party as their candidate for president, after defeating former president Carlos Lleras Restrepo in the party presidential primaries, with the support of former candidate (and presidential successor) Julio C√©sar Turbay. He won the general election by a large margin against the Conservative Party candidate √Ålvaro G√≥mez Hurtado, and the ANAPO candidate, Mar√≠a Eugenia Rojas. His 2,929,719 votes were the highest ever for any president until that time. His inaugural presidential speech, delivered on August 7, 1974, is mostly remembered for calling the disputed border area in the Gulf of Venezuela by its native indigenous name, \\"Gulf of Coquibacoa\\" given by the wayuus. In his speech he also promised to reduce the growing gap between farmer and urban populations and to fight poverty, messages that attracted the support of many left-wing political movements. As a president, L√≥pez declared economic emergency in order to correct the fiscal deficit, which allowed him to implement a number of regulatory measures to control spending, and to reduce subsidies and programs like the tax credit certificate (CAT) which reimbursed partial or total taxes for exporting companies. He also introduced a tax and fiscal reform which increased national saving, and allowed an increase in public investment and exports. Crop production increased 16%, and he also created public offices devoted to the improvement of farming. Under his government, also, power grids were expanded, and infrastructure investment increased. In contrast, inflation reached under his government its highest historical values, at around 32%. Early support for his policies soon turned to fierce opposition, as many of his campaign promises, in particular those to make deals with unions and in the improvement of potable water access, went unfulfilled, and as subsidies were eliminated and inflation rose. Unions and other leftist activists had been accumulating frustration and resentment for decades after the killing of Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n, and the subsequent violence, and the hope for a more open society that came with Lopez election turned into feelings of betrayal. As a result, and after three years as president the major Colombian Unions got together and managed to propose and organize a massive, general strike. The L√≥pez administration took a hard approach towards the planned strike, calling it subversive and at some point threatening arrest and forbidding public meetings. This only enraged the participants, and the major unionists were joined by teachers, students, independent workers, housewives, guerrilla leaders, and even members of the opposition conservative party. The organizing committee demanded among other things salary increases, frozen prices for essential goods and public services fees, reestablishment of the right to meet and strike, and a reduction in work hours. The strike, occurring on September 14, 1977, came to be known as the National Civil Strike, and it attracted such a large number of discontented participants that the organizing committee soon lost control over it. Major roads were blocked all over Bogota, and in many other cities around the country, and very soon many small skirmishes between protesters and riot police started occurring all over. The manifestations and skirmishes soon turned into riots, and protesters started pillaging on big stores and vandalizing factories and cars. By 4 pm the major declared curfew which only made protesters more enraged. Hundreds of protesters were wounded, and thousands were arrested and assembled in the city's Soccer stadium and bullfighting arena. Riots and skirmishes continued all night and well into the next day, which devastated the city. About 20 or 30 people died in the middle of it. As a consequence, unions declared victory and the L√≥pez Michelsen's government had to make concessions. Alternatively, the riot made his government to adopt a harshest, more repressive stance. Post presidency Upon the end of his term in 1978, he again became the leader of Liberal Party. He ran for president again in 1982, but was defeated by the Conservative Party candidate, Belisario Betancur. He continued to actively participate in the decision making of the Liberal Party until the early 1990s when he decided to withdraw from political activity. He was a regular columnist for the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo which drew attention to many critical issues. For this reason he was called \\"el hombre que pone a pensar al pais\\" (Spanish for \\"The man who made the country think\\").

Mar√≠a Cristina was born in Bogot√° to Carlos Arango V√©lez, a Liberal party politician, and his wife Mar√≠a Vega Jaramillo. In 1946, while her father was serving as Ambassador of Colombia to the Holy See, she met Misael Pastrana Borrero, who was working as a diplomat in the embassy.

He sought to increase employment opportunities with a famous four-point strategy. He attempted to boost national savings as a way of moving away from dependency on foreign investment and credit, and he extended pensions rights for many people. At the same time, he was a champion of \\"a car for every Colombian family\\", and was instrumental in bringing the French car-makers Renault to Colombia. He also promoted the first national environmental legislation in Latin America. The end of his four year-term in office came in 1974, which also saw the end of the National Front governments. Pastrana then took on the mantle of the \\"natural leader\\" of the Conservative party. He proved unable to hold the different factions of the party together, however, and in consequence there has only been two Conservative presidents since his own term in office. He died in Bogot√° at the age of 73. Married to Mar√≠a Cristina Arango Vega, with whom he had three sons and one daughter. His second son, Andr√©s Pastrana Arango, who was kidnapped by the Medellin Cartel while running for mayor of Bogot√°, eventually served as president of Colombia from 1998 to 2002.

In addition to its role as military training, tahtib matches were also popular among peasants and farmers. The first evidence of the festive representation of tahtib can only be seen in the New Empire (1500 ‚Äì 1000 BC), as shown by the engravings on the walls of Luxor and Saqq√¢ra W.

Wilson, Ceremonial Games of the New Kingdom , JEA 17 (1931), p. 211-220 Early Christian writings mention tahtib as a leisure activity and a popular art performed by men during weddings and celebrations. It is believed that tahtib developed as a game or performance art in this civilian context.  Performance  As with its combative counterpart, the dance form of tahtib was originally performed by men, but female versions were later developed. In one form, the women dress as men and imitate the males. Another female variant is performed flirtatiously and with less aggression. The latter, called ra's el assaya (dance of the stick) is incorporated into cabaret or Raqs sharqi performances. The stick used for this dance is generally more lightweight and hooked at one end like a cane. It is often embellished with metallic-coloured foil or sequins. The costume is a simple baladi dress. Performances include balancing the cane on the head, hip or shoulder.  Music  Music in tahtib features the tabl (bass drum) and mizmar (folk oboe).video Tahtib street performance on bass drum and Mizmar backstage The right hand uses a heavier stick with a hooked head to beat out the dum (the deep sound from striking the center of the drum) which drive the heartbeat of the rhythm, while the left hand uses a light twig as a switch to produce rapid-fire staccato \\"taks\\" (the higher sound from striking the edge of the drum). Modern tahtib Modern tahtib video 1st demo ever at Martial Arts Int'l Festival Paris 2010 is an attempt to re-explore the sources of tahtib as a fighting art, and to enrich them as a martial practiceAdel Paul Boulad, Modern tahtib : b√¢ton de combat √©gyptien, Budo-Eds, 2014, , p. 279., by codifying the techniques and teaching them structurally. As in traditional tahtib, the main target is the opponent's head, as it is considered the most fragile and vulnerable part of the body. Consequently, techniques revolve around protecting one's own head while reaching the head of the opponent. Victory can be attained either by a single clean touch to the head, or three touches to the body. Unlike its traditional counterpart, modern tahtib allows both women and men to practice in mixed groups.

Moore, who started his career as a stand-up comedian in the late 1960s, heard a rhymed toast about an urban hero named Dolemite from a regular at the record store where he worked, and decided to adopt the persona as an alter ego in his act. Plot Dolemite is a pimp and nightclub owner who is serving 20 years in prison after being set up by a rival, Willie Green (D'Urville Martin) and framed by corruptive detectives (John Kerry) and the mayor (Hy Pyke). After being helped out of jail by Queen Bee (Lady Reed), fellow friend and pimp with lobbying for a pardon, he attempts to rekindle his reputation on the streets while trying to get his \\"The Total Experience\\" club back under control. He has to face Green (in league with the mayor to get black votes in exchange for immunity from prosecution) alongside corrupt detectives and drug dealers selling to the community. In the meantime, he trains his women to do kung fu before ultimately coming face to face with Green and the detectives while an FBI agent (Jerry Jones) lurks in the shadows watching the proceedings. Cast * Rudy Ray Moore as Dolemite * Lady Reed as Queen Bee * D'Urville Martin as Willie Green * West Gale as Reverend Gibbs * John Kerry as Mitchell * Jerry Jones as Blakely * Vainus Rackstraw as Creeper Production Moore first developed the character of Dolemite in his stand-up comedy routines, and later appeared on his 1970 debut album, Eat Out More Often, which reached the top 25 on the Billboard 200. He released several more comedy albums using this persona. In 1975, Moore decided to create a film about Dolemite, paying for most of the production out of his own pocket, and using many of his friends and fellow comedians as cast and crew. The film was directed by D'Urville Martin, who appears as the villain Willie Green. Release=Critical reception Reviews aggregate Rotten Tomatoes assigned the film an approval rating of 64% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 5.32/10. Home media Dolemite was released to DVD on September 13, 2005 by Xenon Pictures and also as part of a boxed set (The Dolemite Collection) on the same date. A widescreen, high definition remastered version, from an original print of the film, was released on Blu- ray disc on April 26, 2016 by Vinegar Syndrome. The Blu-ray also features the previously released open matte version as an alternate \\"boom mic\\" presentation. Sequels A sequel, The Human Tornado, was released in 1976. A second sequel, The Return of Dolemite, was released in 2002 and was later re- titled The Dolemite Explosion for DVD release. A quasi-sequel, Shaolin Dolemite, starring Rudy Ray Moore as Monk Ru-Dee, was released in 1999. The action comedy movie Black Dynamite (2009) is not a direct sequel, but is loosely based on and parodies Dolemite. In popular culture The song \\"Glare\\" on Big Chief's album Drive It Off (1991) opens with a quote from the film: \\"I'm gonna let 'em know that Dolemite is my name, and f***in' up motha f***as is my game!\\" Snoop Dogg mentions Dolemite in his final verse on Dr. Dre's 1992 smash single \\"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang\\", and the character has also been name dropped in songs by Wu Tang Clan, Easy E, Beastie Boys, Lupe Fiasco, and A$AP Rocky. Additionally, a number of rappers, including Too $hort, Luther Campbell, Big Daddy Kane, and Del the Funky Homosapien have given testimony to Rudy's influence on them and on rap generally. Comedian Aries Spears riffed on the Dolemite character during his time on MadTV. A film about the making of Dolemite, titled Dolemite Is My Name and starring Eddie Murphy as Rudy Ray Moore, was released theatrically and on Netflix in October 2019.

His son Vladimir Solovyov was one of the most influential Russian philosophers. His older son Vsevolod Solovyov was a historical novelist. His youngest child, and daughter, Polyxena Solovyova was a noted poet and illustrator. Life and works Solovyov studied in the Moscow University under Timofey Granovsky and travelled in Europe as a tutor of Count Stroganov's children until 1844. The following year he joined the staff of the Moscow University, where he rose to the dean's position (1871-77). He also administrated the Kremlin Armoury and acted as tutor to the future Alexander III of Russia. Solovyov's magnum opus was the History of Russia from the Earliest Times, totally unprecedented in its scope and depth. From 1851 until his death, he published 29 volumes of this work. Among his other books, the History of Poland's Downfall (1863) and the Public Readings on Peter the Great (1872) were probably the most popular. Views and influence Solovyov appreciated Russia's position as the outpost of Christianity in the East. In his opinion, the Russian statehood resulted from a \\"natural and necessary development\\" of numerous political and social forces, which he attempted to trace. He took particular interest in the Time of Troubles and Peter the Great's reforms, which he described as temporary diseases of the organism of the Russian state. In the words of the 2004 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, his History \\"wove a vast body of data into a unified and orderly whole that provided an exceptionally powerful and vivid picture of Russia's political development over the centuries.

Let a be the length of this perpendicular segment, and \\\\Pi(a) be the least angle such that the line drawn through the point does not intersect the given line.

Then length DA is longer than CB, but shorter than CA. Draw a circle around C with radius equal to DA. It will intersect the segment AB at a point E.

See Trigonometry of right triangles for the formulas used here. History The angle of parallelism was developed in 1840 in the German publication \\"Geometrische Untersuchungen zur Theory der Parallellinien\\" by Nikolai Lobachevsky. This publication became widely known in English after the Texas professor G. B. Halsted produced a translation in 1891. (Geometrical Researches on the Theory of Parallels) The following passages define this pivotal concept in hyperbolic geometry: :The angle HAD between the parallel HA and the perpendicular AD is called the parallel angle (angle of parallelism) which we will here designate by Œ†(p) for AD = p.Nikolai Lobachevsky (1840) G. B. Halsted translator (1891) Geometrical Researches on the Theory of Parallels, link from Google Books Demonstration The angle of parallelism, œÜ, formulated as: (a) The angle between the x-axis and the line running from x, the center of Q, to y, the y-intercept of Q, and (b) The angle from the tangent of Q at y to the y-axis. This diagram, with yellow ideal triangle, is similar to one found in a book by Smogorzhevsky.A.S. Smogorzhevsky (1982) Lobachevskian Geometry, ¬ß12 Basic formulas of hyperbolic geometry, figure 37, page 60, Mir Publishers, Moscow In the Poincar√© half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane (see Hyperbolic motions), one can establish the relation of œÜ to a with Euclidean geometry. Let Q be the semicircle with diameter on the x-axis that passes through the points (1,0) and (0,y), where y > 1. Since Q is tangent to the unit semicircle centered at the origin, the two semicircles represent parallel hyperbolic lines. The y-axis crosses both semicircles, making a right angle with the unit semicircle and a variable angle œÜ with Q. The angle at the center of Q subtended by the radius to (0, y) is also œÜ because the two angles have sides that are perpendicular, left side to left side, and right side to right side. The semicircle Q has its center at (x, 0), x < 0, so its radius is 1 ‚àí x. Thus, the radius squared of Q is : x^2 + y^2 = (1 - x)^2, hence : x = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(1 - y^2). The metric of the Poincar√© half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry parametrizes distance on the ray {(0, y) : y > 0 } with logarithmic measure. Let log y = a, so y = ea where e is the base of the natural logarithm. Then the relation between œÜ and a can be deduced from the triangle {(x, 0), (0, 0), (0, y)}, for example: : \\\\tan\\\\phi = \\\\frac{y}{-x} = \\\\frac{2y}{y^2 - 1} = \\\\frac{2e^a}{e^{2a} - 1} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sinh a}.

Retrieved 31 March 201525 January 1977Labour Monthly, March 1977, quoted in . Retrieved 31 March 2015) was a British journalist, remembered mostly now for a few lines of verse. He was known as William or Norman, and by the nickname Trilby. He was prominent writing on foreign affairs for the London Daily Herald. It is now increasingly well established that he spied for the Soviet Union during the 1920s. Biography Ewer studied at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read mathematics for Part I of the Tripos (emerging as fifteenth Wrangler) and history for Part II. He was writing in support of guild socialism and the National Guilds League during World War I (in A. R. Orage's The New Age). He became a Fabian socialist, and from 1919 he was writing in the Daily Herald. Ewer was part of a group of National Guilds League members supportive of the October Revolution. Along with Robin Page Arnot, Rajani Palme Dutt, William Holmes, Will Mellor and Ellen Wilkinson, Ewer formed the Guild Communists, which became a founding element of the Communist Party of Great Britain. There is evidence to show that he was an active and well-connected Soviet agent from the early 1920s, and that this was well known to MI5, who kept him under surveillance. He has been mentioned in connection with Clare Sheridan (1885-1970), writer and sculptor, who passed on comments of Winston Churchill, her relative. Archival material is becoming available, documenting Ewer's success in running an infiltration operation in the United Kingdom. At this period Ewer was a well-known writer in left-wing publications. He was an early opponent of Trotsky, and may have followed instructions from Moscow. It appears that MI5 chose in 1929 not to prosecute, possibly to avoid embarrassment on the government side, but to keep him in place as a biddable journalist. He continued to write on foreign affairs into the Cold War years, taking an anti-Soviet line. Famous quotes Often quoted is :I gave my life for freedom - this I know: :For those who bade me fight had told me so. This is the refrain of his anti-war poem Five Souls, which Ewer contributed to the British Nation on 3 October 1914. Also attributed to him is the epigram :How odd of God/To choose the Jews. This is often taken, with justification, to be anti-Semitic in intent, though it would have passed at the time as wit.

The mediastinum contains the heart and its vessels, the esophagus, the trachea, the phrenic and cardiac nerves, the thoracic duct, the thymus and the lymph nodes of the central chest. Structure frontal view in this illustration, with the superior mediastinum labeled a, and the pericardial cavity, which is part of the inferior mediastinum, labeled d. The mediastinum lies within the thorax and is enclosed on the right and left by pleurae. It is surrounded by the chest wall in front, the lungs to the sides and the spine at the back. It extends from the sternum in front to the vertebral column behind, and contains all the organs of the thorax except the lungs. It is continuous with the loose connective tissue of the neck. The mediastinum can be divided into an upper (or superior) and lower (or inferior) part: * The superior mediastinum starts at the superior thoracic aperture and ends at the thoracic plane. * The thoracic plane separates the superior and inferior mediastinum. It is a plane at the level of the sternal angle, and the intervertebral disc of T4‚ÄìT5.Thoracic Wall, Pleura, and Pericardium ‚Äì Dissector Answers * The inferior mediastinum from this level to the diaphragm.

Anatomists, surgeons, and clinical radiologists compartmentalize the mediastinum differently. For instance, in the radiological scheme of Felson, there are only three compartments (anterior, middle, and posterior), and the heart is part of the middle (inferior) mediastinum. Superior mediastinum The superior mediastinum is bounded: * superiorly by the thoracic inlet, the upper opening of the thorax; * inferiorly by the transverse thoracic plane; * laterally by the pleurae; * anteriorly by the manubrium of the sternum; * posteriorly by the first four thoracic vertebral bodies.

Clinical significance Mediastinal adenopathy The mediastinum is frequently the site of involvement of various tumors: * Anterior mediastinum: substernal thyroid goiters, lymphoma, thymoma, and teratoma. * Middle mediastinum: lymphadenopathy, metastatic disease such as from small cell carcinoma from the lung. * Posterior mediastinum: Neurogenic tumors, either from the nerve sheath (mostly benign) or elsewhere (mostly malignant). Mediastinitis is inflammation of the tissues in the mediastinum, usually bacterial and due to rupture of organs in the mediastinum. As the infection can progress very quickly, this is a serious condition. Pneumomediastinum is the presence of air in the mediastinum, which in some cases can lead to pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, and pneumopericardium if left untreated. However, that does not always occur and sometimes those conditions are actually the cause, not the result, of pneumomediastinum. These conditions frequently accompany Boerhaave syndrome, or spontaneous esophageal rupture. Widened mediastinum Widened mediastinum/mediastinal widening is where the mediastinum has a width greater than 6 cm on an upright PA chest X-ray or 8 cm on supine AP chest film. A widened mediastinum can be indicative of several pathologies: * aortic aneurysm * aortic dissection * aortic unfolding * aortic rupture * hilar lymphadenopathy * anthrax inhalation - a widened mediastinum was found in 7 of the first 10 victims infected by anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) in 2001. *esophageal rupture - presents usually with pneumomediastinum and pleural effusion.

He became nationally and internationally known as one of the three founders of the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in the 1890s. Rawnsley was descended from a line of Church of England vicars, and after briefly considering medicine as a career he graduated from Oxford and took holy orders. In the mid-1870s he worked with the urban poor in London and Bristol, before being appointed in 1877 to a rural parish in Westmorland in the English Lake District. He soon became a vigorous activist in the campaign to preserve the region from excessive industrial development. In 1883 Rawnsley was appointed Vicar of Crosthwaite, Cumberland, in the north of the Lake District. He remained in the post for 34 years, becoming known locally and nationally for his energetic efforts to improve life for working people. He and his wife founded the Keswick School of Industrial Art, and he led campaigns to make access to the countryside available for everyone. Concluding that protests and legislation were not enough to protect the environment, he joined Robert Hunter and Octavia Hill in 1893 to found the National Trust to own land on the public's behalf. It grew to become one of Britain's largest and most important landowners, holding land and buildings in trust for the people of Britain. Rawnsley was a prolific writer, publishing more than 40 books, including verse, sermons, historical studies, travel accounts and biographies. He retired in 1917 and moved to the village of Grasmere, in the southern Lake District, where he died in 1920, aged 68. Life and career=Early years Parish church at Shiplake. Rawnsley was born in the rectory. Hardwicke Rawnsley ‚Äì known to his family and intimates as \\"Hardie\\"Richardson, p. 163; and Griffiths, p. 75 ‚Äì was born at the rectory, Shiplake, Oxfordshire on 28 September 1851.Griffiths, p. 68 He was the second son and fourth of the ten children of the Rev Robert Drummond Burrell Rawnsley (1817‚Äì1882) and his wife, Catherine Ann, n√©e Franklin (1818‚Äì1892).\\"Rawnsley, Rev. Hardwicke Drummond\\", Who's Who, 2020 and Who Was Who, Oxford University Press, December 2007. Retrieved 17 May 2009 In 1862 Drummond Rawnsley accepted the post of vicar of Halton Holegate in the fen district of Lincolnshire. According to Hardwicke Rawnsley's biographer Vivian Griffiths, \\"Observing the wildlife of the Fens, the construction of the Holbeach-to-Spilsby railway and watching the navvies building embankments were to be formative influences\\". Later in 1862, aged eleven, Rawnsley enrolled at Uppingham School, where his godfather, Edward Thring, was headmaster.Richardson, p. xiv Thring became a major influence on him: Rawnsley excelled at athletics and gymnastics, but Thring encouraged his aesthetic side, particularly his budding gifts as a poet.Griffiths, pp. 68‚Äì69 The historian George Bott writes: John Ruskin, a lifelong influence on Rawnsley In 1869 Thring introduced Rawnsley to the Lake District, staying in Grasmere village, where William Wordsworth had lived. Rawnsley quickly came to share the enthusiasm shown by Wordsworth and others for the Lake District landscape.Griffiths, p. 69 In 1870 Rawnsley went up to Balliol College, Oxford, initially reading classics but switching after two years to natural sciences, with the intention of becoming a medical practitioner.Rawnsley (1923), pp. 23‚Äì24Griffiths, p. 70 He was at first an exuberant undergraduate, prominent in athletics and rowing, and not conspicuously conscientious about his studies. His outlook became more serious under the influence of the art critic and social campaigner John Ruskin. Rawnsley was one of a group of undergraduate volunteers ‚Äì others were Oscar Wilde and Arnold Toynbee ‚Äì who undertook manual labour under Ruskin's direction to improve the road and drainage between Oxford and the village of Hinksey.Murphy, p. 77 The project foundered after two months when Ruskin left for Venice, but for Rawnsley it was, in Griffiths's words, \\"life-changing, his social conscience awakened\\". He began to think that the Church rather than medicine was his vocation. In 1874 he graduated with a third class degree in natural sciences and the following year was awarded his Master of Arts degree.\\"Church News\\", The Manchester Guardian, 4 June 1875, p. 5 London and Bristol Octavia Hill (top) and Emma Cons After leaving Oxford, Rawnsley went to work among the urban poor in London.Rawnsley (1923), p. 29 He was appointed lay-chaplain to the Newport Market Refuge, a hostel for the destitute, in the parish of St Mary's, Soho, an insalubrious part of London known for prostitution and poverty.Griffiths, p. 71 Ruskin introduced him to Octavia Hill, the pioneer of social housing, and Rawnsley added to his workload the role of rent-collector for Hill's colleague Emma Cons. Under the strain of his various activities he suffered a nervous breakdown. At Hill's suggestion he went to the Lake District to recuperate, staying first with his cousins at Wray Castle, Westmorland, and then with Thring at Grasmere and finally with Hill's friends the Fletcher family at their house near Ambleside.Rawnsley (1923), p. 30 The eldest daughter of his host and hostess was Edith Fletcher (1846‚Äì1916); she and Rawnsley were mutually attracted, with shared interests in art, literature and nature.Griffiths, p. 72 In December 1875 Rawnsley, his health restored, was ordained deacon.Rawnsley (1923), p. 31 On Thring's recommendation he was appointed to the new post of chaplain to the Clifton College mission, ministering to one of Bristol's poorest areas.Murphy, p. 78; and Griffiths, p. 73 At first there was no building in which services could be held, but Rawnsley secured a disused factory workshop and converted it into a chapel.Rawnsley (1923), p. 32 The ecclesiastical authorities felt that he went too far in his efforts to attract young locals, not confining himself to religious services but organising a temperance club, regular football matches and weekend country walks. He campaigned to save the disused 14th-century St Werburgh's Church from demolition. It was taken down stone by stone and re-erected on a new site.\\"The Re-opening of St. Werburgh's Church\\", The Bristol Mercury and Daily Post, 1 October 1879, p. 3; and Murphy, p. 78 His enthusiasms did not endear him to the conservative hierarchy of the Bristol church, but when he left his post in 1877 he was presented with a testimonial to his work by the mayor and other leading citizens.Rawnsley (1923), p. 36 Vicar of Wray In 1877 Rawnsley and Edith Fletcher became engaged to be married and he began making plans for their life together.Griffiths, p. 74 His cousin Edward Rawnsley's estate at Wray Castle contained a parish church, St Margaret of Antioch, Low Wray. The post of vicar there became vacant and Edward offered it to Rawnsley, who was ordained priest in Carlisle Cathedral on 23 December 1877 and took up the appointment at Wray.\\"Ordination in Carlisle Cathedral\\", The Westmorland Gazette, 29 December 1877, p. 8 St Margaret, Low Wray, where Rawnsley was vicar from 1877 to 1883 Rawnsley and Edith were married in the Fletchers' local church at Brathay in January 1878, in a service conducted by Drummond Rawnsley.\\"Marriages\\", The Lancaster Gazette, 9 February 1878, p. 5; and Griffiths, p. 74 The couple's only child, Noel, was born at Wray in December 1880.Griffiths, p. 75 According to the biographer Graham Murphy, \\"because of his parents' numerous activities and love of travel [Noel] suffered a somewhat solitary childhood\\".Murphy, Graham. \\"Rawnsley, Hardwicke Drummond (1851‚Äì1920)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 25 January 2020 By this time, Ruskin had made his home in the Lake District; since 1873 he had lived at Brantwood on the shore of Coniston Water, 22 miles from Wray.Murphy, p. 56 He had already been involved in a conservation campaign, unsuccessfully opposing the damming of Thirlmere to create a reservoir for the city of Manchester, nearly 100 miles away. Rawnsley visited Ruskin frequently, and in 1880 they discussed \\"how to add happiness to the country labourer's lot\\".Rawnsley (1901), p. 115 The two agreed that \\"idle hands should have something found for them to do by other than the Devil ‚Ä¶ We must bring joy, the joy of eye and hand-skill to our cottage homes\\".Rawnsley (1901), p. 117 Ruskin suggested reviving the old craft of hand-spinning and weaving wool; Rawnsley, considering this infeasible, opted for wood carving.Albritton and Jonsson, p. 54 He recorded that \\"a lady was engaged to come down from South Kensington to give a course of lessons in the three villages, and our humble home industry in the lake district was set on foot.\\" Instruction also included techniques for metal repouss√©, taught by the Swiss butler from Edith Rawnsley's family home.Rawnsley (1901), pp. 118‚Äì119 The young Beatrix Potter holidayed at Wray Castle with her parents in 1882. They met Rawnsley, who became a firm friend, particularly of Beatrix. His views on preserving the natural beauty of the Lake District had a lasting effect on her. He was the first published author she had met, and he took a great interest in her drawings, supporting her in her determination to have them taken seriously and later encouraging her to publish her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit.Griffiths, pp. 75 and 88 They remained close for the rest of Rawnsley's lifetime, and Noel Rawnsley maintained in his later years that Potter had been the real love of his father's life.Murphy, p. 82 Campaigning against railway development Newlands Valley: Rawnsley led the successful campaign to prevent the building of a railway there in 1883 In 1883 parliamentary approval was given for a scheme to build a railway line through the Newlands Valley to carry slate from quarries; the valley was, and is, regarded as one of the most beautiful and tranquil in the Lake District.Welsh, pp. 205 and 212; Grant, p. 188; and Murphy, p. 86 A rival scheme was proposed, to run between Ennerdale Water and the coast. Rawnsley spearheaded a campaign to stop both. Ruskin gave his support, although after the failure of his Thirlmere campaign he was not optimistic about the outcome. Rawnsley held meetings, lobbied assiduously and wrote prolifically to legislators and newspapers. In a letter to The Standard he said: Rawnsley founded the Derwentwater and Borrowdale Defence Committee and enlisted the support of the Commons Preservation Society and the Kyrle Society, two established campaigning conservation organisations headed by well-known figures including Octavia and Miranda Hill, George Shaw Lefevre, James Bryce and Robert Hunter.Ranlett, p. 202 The public paid heed, and protests became so widespread and so strong that the schemes were dropped. Griffiths writes that although by no means solely responsible for the successful outcome of the campaign, Rawnsley \\"became a local and national hero almost overnight, and a new awareness of landscape preservation came to the fore\\".Griffiths, p. 76 The success of the campaign led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District). Rawnsley proposed the foundation of the organisation at a meeting of the Wordsworth Society in 1883. He maintained that for the sake of Wordsworth's literary heritage it was necessary to protect the landscape that had inspired him.Griffiths, p. 77 The stated aim of the society was \\"to protect the Lake District from those injurious encroachments upon its scenery which are from time to time attempted from purely commercial or speculative motives, without regard to its claim as a national recreation ground\\". Besides Rawnsley, founder-members included Ruskin, Robert Browning, the Duke of Westminster and Alfred, Lord Tennyson, with whom Rawnsley had a family connection. As well as saving the landscape from insensitive development, Rawnsley and his colleagues aimed to protect rights of way and the use of common land. The new society gained support not only among local people but throughout Britain, including the cities; there was support from outside Britain, particularly from the United States. Vicar of Crosthwaite St Kentigern's Church bottom left During the time the Lake District Defence Society was being formed, the Bishop of Carlisle, Harvey Goodwin, offered Rawnsley the post of vicar of St Kentigern's, Crosthwaite and rural dean of Keswick. Goodwin said, \\"In my opinion the post which I offer you is as near Heaven as anything in this world can be\\".Rawnsley (1923), p. 55 Rawnsley took up the appointment in July 1883.\\"Preferments and Appointments\\", Manchester Courier, 21 July 1883, p. 16 By contrast with the tiny parish of Wray, which had a population of about 100, Crosthwaite was substantial, with not only St Kentigern's but five outlying churches in the surrounding countryside.Griffiths, p. 78 The parish was founded in the sixth century, and there was much to appeal to Rawnsley's sense of history.Murphy, p. 88 He revived the traditional symbols of St Kentigern ‚Äì a robin, a tree, a bell and a salmon with a ring in its mouth ‚Äì incorporating them in the mosaic floor of the church.Rice, p. 130 He threw himself vigorously into parish life, \\"friend to both landowner and boatman, tourist and local\\" in Griffiths's words.Griffiths, p. 78 At the same time he continued to campaign on a large number of national issues, not only supporting conservation but opposing such practices as vivisection, rabbit coursing, the cruel trapping of animals, and what he called \\"murderous millinery\\" ‚Äì the killing of birds to use their feathers in hats.Rawnsley (1923), p. 85 \\"If there was a committee, he was on it; a church fete, he was opening it\\", commented Griffiths.Griffiths, p. 79 One of his parishioners called him \\"the most active volcano in Europe\\".Murphy, p. 90 Both Murphy and Griffiths add that his reforming zeal sometimes made him \\"intolerably authoritarian\\"; his gardener referred to him as a \\"peppery old swine\\".Murphy, p. 90; and Griffiths, p. 79 alt=Exterior of two-story building of grey stone with large windows and white wooden balcony on upper floor In November 1884 Rawnsley and his wife began organising classes in metalwork and wood carving. There was considerable unemployment in Keswick and the surrounding area, particularly in the winter months, and the Rawnsleys aimed to provide productive and satisfying work. Rawnsley was mindful of advice given to him by William Morris: The classes, for men only, were held in the parish rooms near the centre of the town, under the supervision of Edith Rawnsley, assisted by a local designer and another professional from the South Kensington School of Design.Bott, p. 117 This led to the establishment of the Keswick School of Industrial Art. It flourished and quickly gained a reputation for high-quality copper and silver decorative metalwork. By 1888 nearly seventy men were attending the classes. By 1890 the school was exhibiting nationally and winning prizes.\\"The School of Industrial Arts at Keswick\\". The Manchester Guardian, 5 April 1894, p. 8 To accommodate the increased numbers of students Rawnsley raised funds for a purpose-built home for the school, adjacent to the River Greta. It opened in 1894 and in 1898 a full-time head, Harold Stabler, was appointed, succeeded in 1900 by Herbert Maryon.Griffiths, p. 85 The school was mainly financed from sales of its products, and continued in operation until 1984.Bott, p. 119 For the women of Keswick and the district the Rawnsleys introduced spinning and weaving classes, led by Marion Twelves, a prot√©g√©e of Ruskin. Rawnsley was proud that when Ruskin died in 1900, the pall for the coffin was handspun and handwoven in Keswick under Twelves's direction.Rawnsley (1901), pp. 114‚Äì115 The view from the top of Latrigg In 1887 Rawnsley revived the moribund Keswick and District Footpath Preservation Society, with the principal aim of stopping landowners blocking public rights of way across their land. The owner of Fawe Park, Portinscale, had done so between the Derwentwater shore and the slopes of Catbells. When persuasion failed, Rawnsley led hundreds of demonstrators to demolish the barriers.Ranlett, p. 204; and Bott, p. 105 Bott comments that this dispute roused local passions, but that the next confrontation between Rawnsley and local landowners earned national headlines.Bott, p. 105 The owner of Latrigg, a fell overlooking Keswick, attempted to block access along two paths and challenged the objectors to trespass, with a view to bringing a test case in court. The barriers were torn down and more than 2,000 people marched to the Latrigg summit. The case came to trial and a compromise was reached: one path remained closed but the other was recognised as an inalienable public right of way.Bott, p. 106 In addition to his post at Crosthwaite, Rawnsley was appointed as an honorary canon of Carlisle Cathedral in 1891. Within his parish, his interest in education led him to take a large part in founding Keswick High School, one of the first co-educational secondary schools in the country, which opened in October 1898. He was chairman of the school's board of governors, and Cumberland's director of education described him as \\"the real founder of the Keswick High School\\".Bott, p. 147 To Rawnsley, education was not merely about the basic \\"three Rs\\"; it had to also incorporate culture, art, awareness of nature and responsibility to all living things.Griffiths, pp. 82‚Äì83 County Councillor Of the three people who later founded the National Trust, Rawnsley was the only one who associated himself even loosely with a party political movement. Robert Hunter, as a civil servant, was not permitted to do so and Octavia Hill was wary of governments and parties in general.Cowell, pp. 299 and 303 There were two main British parties at the time: the Conservatives, seen as defending the interests of the landed aristocracy,Harbour, pp. 137‚Äì138 and the Liberals, generally more sympathetic to ideas about environmental protection and public access to the countryside.Cowell, pp. 302 and 309 When English local government was reorganised in the late 1880s Rawnsley stood as an independent Liberal for the newly-formed Cumberland County Council in January 1889. He was elected as the member for Keswick. Rawnsley, early 1890s Rawnsley became chairman of the council's Highways Committee.Griffiths, p. 82 He stood out against the construction of roads over lakeland passes, secured controls over mining pollution, and promoted adequate signposting of footpaths. As a councillor he was continually at odds with the brewing industry. He hated drunkenness, and opposed what he saw as excessive numbers of public houses and unduly lax alcohol licensing regulations. But he was never a prohibitionist: after returning from a tour of French vineyards he wrote to The Times protesting against Britain's high tax on the importation of French wine, which he saw as unfair and as contributing to rural poverty in France.\\"Letters to the Editor\\", The Times, 26 April 1920, p. 10 Ruskin's emphasis on practical skills was a lifelong influence on Rawnsley, and as a county councillor he promoted a mobile dairy hygiene unit. Its horse-drawn dairies toured the farms and villages, showing how to produce butter and cheese to the highest standards. Griffiths comments that it not only improved life for local farm workers but also led to increased competition against Danish dairy imports.Griffiths, p. 83 This initiative developed into the Newton Rigg Farm School, near Penrith, which opened in 1896 and (at 2020) continues as Newton Rigg College.\\"Exciting Future Beckons for Newton Rigg College\\", Newton Rigg College. Retrieved 28 January 2020 Rawnsley was also instrumental in founding a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients on Blencathra, 900 ft (275m) above sea level, where the mountain air was believed to be beneficial.\\"On Blencathra Slopes: Cumberland's New Sanatorium for Consumption\\", Lancashire Evening Post, 3 October 1904, p. 4 His concern for the health of the community prompted him to campaign against over-processed white bread, encourage fell running and above all strive to ensure that footpaths were kept open to allow walking.Bott, pp. 105‚Äì106; and Griffiths, p. 79 He lost his seat on the council in 1895, the vote probably tipped by objections to his firm stance on public houses and alcohol licensing.Cowell, p. 304; and Griffiths, p. 83 National Trust By 1890 Rawnsley had become convinced that the surest means of protecting land for public enjoyment was not lobbying or legislation but ownership.Aldous, Tony. \\"Protecting the Lake District\\", The Illustrated London News, 1 January 1976, p. 27 There had been cases in which people wished to give or bequeath property to the public, but there was no suitable national body that was legally capable of owning it.Cowell, pp. 304‚Äì305 In 1884 Hunter had proposed \\"the formation of a corporate company\\" to hold properties \\"with a view to the protection of the public interest in the open spaces of the country\\". Hill was in favour of the idea but the Commons Preservation Society was against it, fearing that such a body would compete with it for public support; the proposal was allowed to lapse.Ranlett, p. 211 In 1893 several important properties in the Lake District came up for sale, and Rawnsley went to London to discuss with Hunter and Hill how the sites might be acquired for the public. They agreed to revive the proposal of a national trust. An inaugural meeting was convened at Grosvenor House, London, in July 1894; Hunter and Rawnsley were elected chairman and secretary respectively.Ranlett, pp. 211‚Äì212 The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty formally came into being in January 1895.Ranlett, p. 212 Until his death, Rawnsley worked as honorary secretary to the Trust. He was responsible for the campaign to raise the ¬£6,500 needed to buy Brandlehow Woods and Fell, a 105 acre property, the National Trust's first purchase in the Lake District.Rawnsley (1923), p. 111 He was at the forefront of successful efforts to buy other properties in Cumberland and Westmorland: the 750 acre Gowbarrow Fell at Ullswater (1906); a large tract at the southern end of Derwentwater 1908, including a wooded knoll given by the Rawnsleys to mark their 25th year in the district (1908); extensive holdings in Borrowdale including the Bowder Stone (1910);Rawnsley (1923), pp. 112‚Äì114 and the site of the Castlerigg stone circle (1913).Bott, p. 3 He was active elsewhere in the country on the National Trust's behalf. By the time of his death in 1920 the trust held 994 estates throughout England and Wales, including Waggoners Wells, Hampshire, acquired in memory of Hunter and Hydon's Ball, Surrey, in memory of Hill. Later years Rawnsley was a frequent traveller. He and his wife made several walking and painting tours in the Alps, visited the Holy Land and went to Egypt when their son was working there in Sir Flinders Petrie's archaeological team. Rawnsley published accounts of his trips and books of poetry inspired by them. In 1896 he went to Russia as a newspaper correspondent to cover the coronation of Nicholas II, and three years later he toured the eastern states of the United States as ambassador for the National Trust. After the launch of the National Trust, Rawnsley continued to campaign on other issues about which he felt strongly. He took a leading role in the erection of monuments to Wordsworth (Cockermouth, 1896), Caedmon (Whitby, 1896) and Bede (Monkwearmouth, 1903).Friend, Hilderic. \\"The Wordsworth Memorial\\", The Wesleyan-Methodist Magazine, September 1896, p. 647; and \\"The Bede Memorial\\", British Architect, 24 April 1903, pp. 294‚Äì295 He turned his attention to the cinema, where he was strongly against the depiction of sex and violence. His loathing of indecency extended to an aversion to saucy seaside postcards. He encouraged young people not to attend \\"lurid crime films at kinemas\\", and turn instead to wholesome organisations such as the YMCA, Boy Scouts and Girl Guides.\\"A Terrible Indictment!\\", The Review of Reviews, August 1917, p. 134 In 1898 Rawnsley was offered the bishopric of Madagascar, but declined it, feeling himself committed to his conservation work in the Lake District and, by then, in many other parts of the British countryside. In 1909 he was appointed a residentiary canon of Carlisle Cathedral, and spent three months a year staying in the Cathedral Close. alt=old stone bridge, double- arched, across a river A local controversy in 1911 made national news, when Rawnsley and Hunter successfully opposed the county council's proposal to demolish the medieval Portinscale bridge across the River Derwent near St Kentigern's and replace it with a modern structure. Proponents of a new bridge maintained that antiquity alone did not justify retaining an old structure: it must, they contended, have \\"historic associations\\".\\"The Care of Old Bridges\\", The Times, 30 October 1911, p. 9 This argument was widely ridiculed and the council backed down, outmanoeuvred by Rawnsley, who, together with the owner of the adjacent property, offered to underwrite the cost of strengthening the old bridge.Hunter, Sir Robert. \\"Portinscale Bridge\\", The Times, 31 October 1911, p. 11 In 1912 Rawnsley was appointed to the honorary position of chaplain to the king, and he held the post of chaplain to the Border Regiment of the Territorial Force, with the rank of colonel.Obituary, The Times, 29 May 1920, p. 11 When the First World War began in 1914 Rawnsley's views were straightforward: \\"The German envy and hate, which has been nursed against us secretly for the last 30 years, is now seen in all its open madness. It is the blackest and most devilish thing that has been heard of in history\\".Rawnsley, H. D. Letter to the Editor, The Yorkshire Post, 6 November 1914, p. 2 He urged the young men of Cumberland to fight \\"for home and Empire\\". Among the volunteers was his son, Noel, who survived the war. Rawnsley's confidence was shaken as the war went on and the lists of casualties grew longer and longer.Griffiths, p. 89 When the war ended he was at the forefront of organising the peace celebrations. In 1915, with a view to eventual retirement, Rawnsley bought Allan Bank, Grasmere, a house in which Wordsworth had lived between 1808 and 1811. While he was staying at Carlisle in December 1916 his wife died at Crosthwaite from cardiac arrest brought on by influenza. Rawnsley, who had also caught influenza, was too ill to attend her funeral.Griffiths, p. 90 In his absence the service was led by the Bishop of Barrow-in-Furness, Campbell West-Watson.\\"Funeral of Mrs Rawnsley\\", Penrith Observer, 9 January 1917, p. 7 Rawnsley felt unable to carry on without Edith's help, and the week after Easter 1917 he resigned from St Kentigern's after 34 years and retired to Allan Bank.Rawnsley (1923), pp. 244 and 247 He continued his work for the National Trust and remained an active Canon of Carlisle.Rawnsley (1923), p. 251 In 1918 he married Eleanor \\"Nellie\\" Foster Simpson, a long-standing friend to him and Edith, who had for some years been his secretary. After the marriage the couple's honeymoon consisted of a tour of National Trust properties in Wales, a trip that was the basis of Rawnsley's last book, a study of thirteen of the trust's properties in Wales and the West Country.Rawnsley (1923), p. 9 Memorial to Rawnsley at Friar's Crag, Keswick Rawnsley suffered a heart attack and died at Allan Bank on 28 May 1920, after a brief illness. He was buried in the churchyard of St Kentigern's alongside Edith. He bequeathed Allan Bank to the National Trust, with a lifetime lease to Eleanor, who lived there until her death in 1959. Legacy In its obituary notice, The Times wrote that \\"It is no exaggeration to say ‚Äì and it is much to say of anyone ‚Äì that England would be a much duller and less healthy and happy country if [Rawnsley] had not lived and worked.\\" To commemorate him, the National Trust raised funds soon after his death to buy Friars' Crag, Lord's Island and other land bordering Derwentwater. A memorial stone is set in the wall alongside the path from the Keswick landing stages to the end of Friars' Crag.Rawnsley (1923), p. 256 Eleanor Rawnsley wrote a biography of her husband, published by his regular publisher, MacLehose, in 1923.Rawnsley (1923), title page Rawnsley published more than forty books, some on religious subjects, many with a Lake District theme, and, as the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography put it, \\"as a minor lake poet, a vast output of verse.\\" His memoir of Ruskin (1901) was described by The New York Times as \\"in many ways the best volume [of] his series of books upon some of the literary aspects of the Lake Country\\".\\"Ruskin: Canon Rawnsley's Volume on His Connection with the English Lakes\\", The New York Times, 1 March 1902, Page BR7 Books by Rawnsley        (by Giovanni Parenti, translated and edited by Rawnsley)   Notes, references and sources=NotesReferencesSourcesBooks=    =Journals= * External links Biography at Visit Cumbria *Beatrix Potter's Lake District (Liverpool Museums) *Poems, Ballads, and Bucolics, by Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley *A Book of Bristol Sonnets, by Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley *Ruskin and the English Lakes, by Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley *Sermons of Canon H D Rawnsley at Cumbria Archive Centre, Kendal 1851 births 1920 deaths Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford British environmentalists Christian hymnwriters English hymnwriters English male poets Members of Cumberland County Council People educated at Uppingham School 19th-century English Anglican priests 20th-century English Anglican priests English male writers National Trust people ","title":"Hardwicke Rawnsley"},{"id":"1341638","text":"Fordyce may refer to: People=Given name * Fordyce L.

The RSA building, viewed from the south The North portico, specially decorated for an Andy Warhol exhibition on the 20th anniversary of the artist's death The Royal Scottish Academy (RSA) is the country‚Äôs national academy of art. It promotes contemporary Scottish art. The Academy was founded in 1826 by eleven artists meeting in Edinburgh. Originally named the Scottish Academy, it became the Royal Scottish Academy on being granted a royal charter in 1838. The RSA maintains a unique position in the country as an independently funded institution led by eminent artists and architects to promote and support the creation, understanding, and enjoyment of visual arts through exhibitions and related educational events.The Royal Scottish Academy of Painting, Sculpture, Architecture and Printmaking Overview In addition to a continuous programme of exhibitions, the RSA also administers scholarships, awards, and residencies for artists who live and work in Scotland. The RSA's historic collection of important artworks and an extensive archive of related material chronicling art and architecture in Scotland over the last 180 years are housed in the National Museums Collection Centre at Granton, and are available to researchers by appointment. Displays of the historic collections are mounted whenever possible. Its home since 1911 has been the Royal Scottish Academy Building on The Mound, Princes Street, Edinburgh, adjacent to the National Gallery of Scotland building. The building is managed by the National Galleries of Scotland but the 1910 Order grants the RSA permanent administration offices in the building. Exhibition space is shared throughout the year with the Scottish National Gallery and other organisations (Exhibiting Societies of Scottish Artists). The building, originally designed by William Henry Playfair, was recently refurbished as part of the Playfair Project and is now part of the Scottish National Gallery complex. Academicians The RSA is led by a body of eminent artist and architect members who encompass a broad cross-section of contemporary Scottish art. Members are known as Academicians, and are entitled to use the post-nominal letters RSA. The president uses the postnominal letters PRSA while in office, and PPRSA (Past President of the RSA) thereafter. Academicians are elected to the Academy by their peers. There are also Honorary Academicians (HRSA), including the RSA's patron, the Duke of Edinburgh. After amendments to the Supplementary Charter in 2005, once Associates (ARSA) have submitted a Diploma work into the Permanent Collection of the RSA, they are then entitled to full membership of the Academy. The membership includes 30 Honorary Academicians and 104 Academicians. From 2010-12, the RSA President was Professor Bill Scott, Secretary Arthur Watson and Treasurer Professor Ian Howard. In 2018, Joyce W. Cairns was elected as the first female President in the history of the Academy. RSA President, Joyce W.

It was founded in 1784 by Moses Brown, a Quaker abolitionist, and is the 69th oldest preparatory school in the country. The school motto is Verum Honorem, \\"For The Honor of Truth,\\" and the school song is \\"In the Shadow of the Elms,\\" a reference to the large grove of elm trees that still surrounds the school. Founder Moses Brown Moses Brown (1738‚Äì1836), the school's founder, was a member of the Brown family, a powerful mercantile family of New England. Brown was a pioneering advocate of abolition of slavery, co-founded Brown University, and an industrialist. History First meeting place of the school from 1784‚Äì1788 In 1777 a committee of New England Yearly Meeting which included Brown, took up the idea for a school to educate young Quakers in New England. The school opened in 1784 at Portsmouth Friends Meeting House in Portsmouth on Aquidneck Island, However, in the years after the American Revolution there was a shortage of student and teachers. Four years later the Yearly Meeting decided to close the school. During those years, Moses Brown worked to restart the school, and, as treasurer of the school fund, was able to convince the Yearly Meeting to reopen the school ‚Äì in part by donating the land in Providence for the school to be built on. Main building in Providence The school reopened in 1819 in Providence. Moses Brown joined with his son Obadiah and his son-in-law William Almy to pay for the construction of the first building, which still serves as the main building of the school. Obadiah Brown also left $100,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in his will to the school, a sum unheard of at the time for a school endowment or gift. In 1904 the school was renamed \\"Moses Brown School\\" to honor its benefactor and advocate. It offered an \\"upper\\" and \\"lower\\" school for \\"younger boys\\". As the Quakers were early advocates of gender equality, Moses Brown School was a co-educational school. However, in 1926 it became a boys-only school as was the fashion in U.S. society at the time. As attitudes again became more liberal, it again became coed in 1976. Well-known faculty over the years included the twin Quaker educators Alfred and Albert Smiley in the mid-Nineteenth Century and noted children's author Scott Corbett in the 1960s. \\"Moses Brown School: A History of its Third Half- Century\\" by Bill Paxton, covers the school's history during the period 1919‚Äì1969. the school was owned by New England Yearly Meeting, with its own Board of Overseers, and operated independently of the yearly meeting. The school was examining the possibility of changing its specific affiliation while still retaining its identity as a Quaker school. Academics Ninth and tenth grade students are offered limited flexibility in their courses, aiming to expose them to a varied selection of topics. English is the only subject mandated through four years in the Upper School. Students must take calculus in order to satisfy their mathematics requirement, study a single language for three years, and lab sciences for two. There is a requirement for a comparative religions class. Students are also required to take a minimum of two semesters of fine art courses. Students are required to participate in varied school activities whether athletic, theater, dance or community service. In popular culture The school briefly made headlines during the January 2015 nor'easter when Headmaster Matt Glendinning released a music video called \\"School Is Closed\\", in which he parodied \\"Let It Go\\" from Frozen.

Biography Bracegirdle was born to Justinian and Martha (born Furniss) Bracegirdle in Northamptonshire. She was baptised in Northampton on 15 November 1671, although her tombstone says that she died at the age of 85 (suggesting that she was born around 1663).\\"Anne was baptized, probably as an infant, at St Giles, Northampton, on 15 November 1671 and was about seventy- seven when she died in 1748, rather than eighty-five, as recorded on her tombstone in Westminster Abbey.\\" J. Milling, \\"Bracegirdle, Anne (bap. 1671, d. 1748)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2010 accessed 1 June 2012 She was probably raised by actors Thomas and Mary Betterton from an early age,J. Milling, \\"Bracegirdle, Anne (bap. 1671, d. 1748)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2010 accessed 1 June 2012 and it is speculated that she was the \\"little girl\\" referred to several times in playbills before 1688 for the Duke's Company, where Thomas Betterton was the big star. For this reason it has been concluded by the Garrick Club that 1673 is the date of her birth. Her name first appears in the Lord Chamberlain's accounts in 1688 as a member of the United Company (into which the Duke's Company had by then merged), and a few of her roles in the following years are known through surviving manuscript cast lists. She played Semernia in Aphra Behn's The Widow Ranter in 1689, a breeches role, a type of role she would often return to, and was by 1690 playing parts like Lady Anne in Shakespeare's Richard III and Desdemona in Othello. Soon, she had become one of the important members of the company and an audience favourite, indicated by the frequency with which she spoke prologues and epilogues. In 1705 she played in Nicholas Rowe's tragedy Ulysses. After 1705 she found a serious competitor in Anne Oldfield, then first coming into public favour. As it became apparent that audiences preferred her rival, Anne Bracegirdle quit the stage, making only one reappearance at Betterton's benefit in 1709. Cibber's account Colley Cibber described Bracegirdle in his autobiography as she appeared in 1690, when he first joined the company at Drury Lane: > She had no greater Claim to Beauty than what the most desirable Brunette > might pretend to. But her Youth and lively Aspect threw out such a Glow of > Health and Chearfulness, that on the Stage few Spectators that were not past > it could behold her without Desire. It was even a Fashion among the Gay and > Young to have a Taste or Tendre for Mrs. Bracegirdle‚Ä¶ In all the chief Parts > she acted, the Desirable was so predominant, that no Judge could be cold > enough to consider from what other particular Excellence she became > delightful. Cibber was smitten. He describes his own highest acting ambition (never fulfilled) as a new and inconspicuous company employee to have been that of \\"playing a Lover with Mrs. Bracegirdle\\". In 1692, the \\"tendre\\" felt by both Captain Richard Hill and the actor William Mountfort, caused a celebrated tragedy. The jealous Hill and a gang of toughs led by the infamous Lord Mohun attempted to abduct Anne and murdered Mountfort, her presumed lover, in the street. Hill made his escape from justice, but Mohun stood trial and was acquitted. Both died violent deaths years later. It was said that the publicity assisted her career and she was still called the \\"celebrated virgin\\" in 1702. Bracegirdle made a request to be buried in Westminster Abbey, a wish that would be fulfilled. ReferencesSources *Cibber, Colley (first published 1740, ed. Robert Lowe, 1889).

Personal life Valencia was born in Popay√°n, Cauca on April 27, 1909, to Colombian poet and politician Guillermo Valencia, and his wife Josefina Mu√±oz. He attended highschool at the Colegio Champagnat in Bogot√° and graduated in December of 1946. On January 31, 1931 he married Susana L√≥pez Navia, a 20-year-old secretary with whom he had four children: Pedro Felipe, Alma, Ignacio, and Diana. Political career Valencia was elected to the city council of Popay√°n and the Assembly of Cauca. Later he was also elected to the City Council of Bogot√° and worked as diplomat for Colombia to the United Nations and was appointed Colombia's Ambassador to Spain by President Laureano G√≥mez Castro. In 1949 he was appointed by President Mariano Ospina P√©rez as Colombian Minister of Foreign Affairs but declined the offer. However, four years later Valencia did accept the position and became Minister of Foreign Affairs on May 25, 1953, a post he held for the remainder of the administration of Roberto Urdaneta Arbel√°ez until General Rojas Pinilla took over. During the transitional government of the Military Junta that took power after the coup d'√©tat that deposed General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, Valencia was under consideration to succeed the Junta. However, the political accord between the political forces of the time (in pursuit of a transition from a dictatorship to a democratic process), specified that a member of the Colombian Liberal Party succeed the Junta Militar. Consequently, Valencia had to wait until the following election. In 1962, Valencia was nominated by the Colombian Conservative Party as their candidate for the presidency, facing the liberal Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen. Valencia won: 1,636,081 votes to 625,630. Presidency Valencia committed his administration to substantial economic and social reforms. On the economic front, he created the Junta Monetaria (Federal Reserve), doubled the production of electric power and promoted both oil drilling and the export of crude oil. In matters of social reform, his administration increased the national budget for education by 20%, and under the auspices of the government of the United States, launched the construction of Ciudad Kennedy, a project of 200,000 affordable homes for lower income citizens.

Early military actions Portrait of Demosthenes by Polyeuktos. 1881 Young Peoples' Cyclopedia of Persons and Places The military activities of Demosthenes are first recorded from 426 BC when he led an Athenian invasion of Aetolia. This was a failure. Demosthenes lost about 120 Athenians along with his second in command, Procles. Demosthenes' allies also suffered heavy losses.Thucydides, \\"History of the Peloponnesian War\\" Book 3, 98. (2007, April 11). In Wikisource, The Free Library. Retrieved 21:45, August 25, 2007, from here As a result of this loss, Demosthenes did not return to Athens, fearing for his life. However, later that year, Ambracia invaded Acarnania. The Acarnanians sought help from Demosthenes, who was now patrolling the coast of the Ionian Sea with twenty Athenian ships. He landed at Olpae and defeated a Spartan army under Eurylochus, which had come to assist the Ambraciots. Eurylochus was killed in the Battle of Olpae and the Acarnanians and Ambraciots signed a peace treaty. Success in the Peloponnese In 425 BC, while still with his fleet in the Ionian Sea, he was ordered by Cleon to join a fleet sent from Athens to put down a revolt in Sicily. Due to a storm, Demosthenes instead landed at Pylos in the Peloponnese. In order to keep his soldiers busy, he had them fortify the port, giving Athens a strong base close to Sparta. Sparta, meanwhile, landed an army on the nearby island of Sphacteria, and Demosthenes moved his men to the beach to prevent the Spartans, commanded by Thrasymelidas and Brasidas, from landing there. The Spartan landing was repulsed, and the main Athenian fleet (having turned back from its journey to Sicily) arrived in time to chase off the Spartan ships. Back in Athens, the Spartans tried to negotiate a peace. This failed, and Cleon went to assist Demosthenes, who was planning an invasion of Sphacteria. The Athenian forces successfully attacked Sphacteria, forcing the Spartans to surrender ‚Äì a very unusual event. See Battle of Pylos and Battle of Sphacteria. Further action during the Peloponnesian War In 424 BC, Demosthenes and Hippocrates attempted to capture Megara, but were defeated by Brasidas. Demosthenes then went to Naupactus to support the democratic revolution there and to gather troops for an invasion of Boeotia. Demosthenes and Hippocrates were unable to coordinate their attacks and Hippocrates was defeated at the Battle of Delium. Demosthenes instead attacked Sicyon and was defeated as well. Demosthenes was one of the signatories of the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC, which ended the first half of the Peloponnesian War. (A different Demosthenes was also a signatory for Sparta.) In 417 BC, Demosthenes was responsible for evacuating the Athenian troops from Epidaurus following the Battle of Mantinea. He is said to have organized athletic games and the Athenian troops escaped while the Epidaurans were distracted by the games. The Sicilian Expedition After Athens invaded Sicily in 415 BC, a Spartan fleet arrived to reinforce their allies in Syracuse, with a stalemate ensuing. In 413 BC, Demosthenes and Eurymedon were sent with a new fleet of seventy-three ships and 5000 hoplites. Demosthenes landed his troops and led a bold night attack on Syracusan forces. After initial success, the Athenians became disorganized in what became a chaotic night operation, and were thoroughly routed by Gylippus, the Spartan commander. After the defeat, and upon seeing the disease-ridden Athenian camp, Demosthenes suggested that they immediately give up the siege and return to Athens, where they were needed to defend the city against a Spartan invasion of Attica. Nicias, the Athenian commander in charge, at first refused, until still, more Spartans arrived. However, while preparing to leave, there was a lunar eclipse, which delayed the departure as this was considered a bad omen. The delay allowed the Syracusans and Spartans to trap the Athenian forces in the harbour and Eurymedon was killed in the ensuing battle. The Spartans forced the Athenians to return their forces to the land. Demosthenes thought they could still flee by ship, but Nicias wanted to find refuge on land. After a few days of marching, Demosthenes and Nicias became separated; Demosthenes was ambushed by the Syracusans and was forced to surrender. Nicias was soon captured as well, and both were executed despite the contrary orders of Gylippus, who had hoped Demosthenes and Nicias could be brought back to Sparta as prisoners. A character in an Aristophanes play Demosthenes was also a character in The Knights by Aristophanes. Along with Nicias, he is a slave who overthrows \\"the Paphlagonian,\\" a character representing Cleon. The characters in the play were based on the real people, who were contemporaries of Aristophanes.

It is a consequence of the theorem, also called Engel's theorem, which says that if a Lie algebra of matrices consists of nilpotent matrices, then the matrices can all be simultaneously brought to a strictly upper triangular form. The theorem is named after the mathematician Friedrich Engel, who sketched a proof of it in a letter to Wilhelm Killing dated 20 July 1890 . Engel's student K.A. Umlauf gave a complete proof in his 1891 dissertation, reprinted as .  Statements  Let \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V) be the Lie algebra of the endomorphisms of a finite- dimensional vector space V and \\\\mathfrak g \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V) a subalgebra. Then Engel's theorem states the following are equivalent: # Each X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g} is a nilpotent endomorphism on V. # There exists a flag V = V_0 \\\\supset V_1 \\\\supset \\\\cdots \\\\supset V_n = 0, \\\\, \\\\operatorname{codim} V_i = i such that \\\\mathfrak g \\\\cdot V_i \\\\subset V_{i+1}; i.e., the elements of \\\\mathfrak g are simultaneously strictly upper-triangulizable. Note that no assumption on the underlying base field is required. We note that Statement 2. for various \\\\mathfrak g and V is equivalent to the statement :For each nonzero finite-dimensional vector space V and a subalgebra \\\\mathfrak g \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V), there exists a nonzero vector v in V such that X(v) = 0 for every X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g. This is the form of the theorem proven in #Proof. (This statement is trivially equivalent to Statement 2 since it allows one to inductively construct a flag with the required property.) In general, a Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g is said to be nilpotent if the lower central series of it vanishes in a finite step; i.e., for C^0 \\\\mathfrak g = \\\\mathfrak g, C^i \\\\mathfrak g = [\\\\mathfrak g, C^{i-1} \\\\mathfrak g] = (i+1)-th power of \\\\mathfrak g, there is some k such that C^k \\\\mathfrak g = 0. Then Engel's theorem gives the theorem (also called Engel's theorem): when \\\\mathfrak g has finite dimension, \\\\mathfrak g is nilpotent if and only if \\\\operatorname{ad}(X) is nilpotent for each X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g. Indeed, if \\\\operatorname{ad}(\\\\mathfrak g) consists of nilpotent operators, then by 1. \\\\Leftrightarrow 2\\\\. applied to the algebra \\\\operatorname{ad}(\\\\mathfrak g) \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{gl}(\\\\mathfrak g), there exists a flag \\\\mathfrak g = \\\\mathfrak{g}_0 \\\\supset \\\\mathfrak{g}_1 \\\\supset \\\\cdots \\\\supset \\\\mathfrak{g}_n = 0 such that [\\\\mathfrak g, \\\\mathfrak g_i] \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak g_{i+1}. Since C^i \\\\mathfrak g\\\\subset \\\\mathfrak g_i, this implies \\\\mathfrak g is nilpotent. (The converse follows straightforwardly from the definition.)  Proof  We prove the following form of the theorem: if \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V) is a Lie subalgebra such that every X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g} is a nilpotent endomorphism and if V has positive dimension, then there exists a nonzero vector v in V such that X(v) = 0 for each X in \\\\mathfrak{g}. The proof is by induction on the dimension of \\\\mathfrak{g} and consists of a few steps. (Note the structure of the proof is very similar to that for Lie's theorem, which concerns a solvable algebra.) The basic case is trivial and we assume the dimension of \\\\mathfrak{g} is positive. Step 1: Find an ideal \\\\mathfrak{h} of codimension one in \\\\mathfrak{g}. :This is the most difficult step. Let \\\\mathfrak{h} be a maximal (proper) subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{g}, which exists by finite-dimensionality. We claim it is an ideal and has codimension one. For each X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak h, it is easy to check that (1) \\\\operatorname{ad}(X) induces a linear endomorphism \\\\mathfrak{g}/\\\\mathfrak{h} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{g}/\\\\mathfrak{h} and (2) this induced map is nilpotent (in fact, \\\\operatorname{ad}(X) is nilpotent). Thus, by inductive hypothesis, there exists a nonzero vector v in \\\\mathfrak{g}/\\\\mathfrak{h} such that \\\\operatorname{ad}(X)(v) = 0 for each X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}. That is to say, if v = [Y] for some Y in \\\\mathfrak{g} but not in \\\\mathfrak h, then [X, Y] = \\\\operatorname{ad}(X)(Y) \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h} for every X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}. But then the subspace \\\\mathfrak{h}' \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{g} spanned by \\\\mathfrak{h} and Y is a Lie subalgebra in which \\\\mathfrak{h} is an ideal. Hence, by maximality, \\\\mathfrak{h}' = \\\\mathfrak g. This proves the claim. Step 2: Let W = \\\\\\\\{ v \\\\in V  X(v) = 0, X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h} \\\\\\\\}. Then \\\\mathfrak{g} stabilizes W; i.e., X (v) \\\\in W for each X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}, v \\\\in W. :Indeed, for Y in \\\\mathfrak{g} and X in \\\\mathfrak{h}, we have: X(Y(v)) = Y(X(v)) + [X, Y](v) = 0 since \\\\mathfrak{h} is an ideal and so [X, Y] \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}. Thus, Y(v) is in W. Step 3: Finish up the proof by finding a nonzero vector that gets killed by \\\\mathfrak{g}. :Write \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{h} + L where L is a one-dimensional vector subspace. Let Y be a nonzero vector in L and v a nonzero vector in W. Now, Y is a nilpotent endomorphism (by hypothesis) and so Y^k(v) e 0, Y^{k+1}(v) = 0 for some k. Then Y^k(v) is a required vector as the vector lies in W by Step 2. \\\\square  See also  * Lie's theorem * Heisenberg group  Notes =Citations=Works cited  Representation theory of Lie algebras Theorems in representation theory ","title":"Engel's theorem"},{"id":"1341659","text":"Denver Township may refer to the following places in the United States: * Denver Township, Richland County, Illinois * Denver Township, Isabella County, Michigan * Denver Township, Newaygo County, Michigan * Denver Township, Rock County, Minnesota * Denver Township, Adams County, Nebraska  See also  * Denver (disambiguation) Township name disambiguation pages ","title":"Denver Township"},{"id":"1341663","title":"1978 United States House of Representatives elections"},{"id":"1341664","text":"Acharne may refer to: * Acharne, Greece, a suburb of Athens * Acharrae, an ancient town of Thessaly ","title":"Acharne"},{"id":"1341669","text":"Elbit Skylark 1 unmanned aerial vehicle Elbit Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle Elbit Hermes 900 unmanned aerial vehicle Elbit Systems Ltd. is an Israel-based international defense electronics company engaged in a wide range of programs throughout the world. The company, which includes Elbit Systems and its subsidiaries, operates in the areas of aerospace, land and naval systems, command, control, communications, computers, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), advanced electro-optics, electro-optic space systems, electronic warfare suites, signal intelligence (SIGINT) systems, data links and communications systems and radios. The company also focuses on the upgrading of existing military platforms, developing new technologies for defense, homeland security and commercial aviation applications and providing a range of support services, including training and simulation systems. In 2016, Elbit Systems had approximately 13,895 employees, the majority of whom are engaged in engineering, mechanics, research and development, and other computing and technical areas. Elbit Systems' shares are traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. History=Early years ‚Äì A division within Elron Elbit Systems was founded in 1966 by Elron Electronic Industries (), which combined the existing expertise within the Israel Ministry of Defense-Research Institute in special computer design with Elron's experience in electronic product design, manufacture and management (initially under the name Elbit Computers). Elbit steadily expanded developing and producing logistic-support weapon delivery and navigation systems for most Israeli aircraft, establishing a combat avionics package for the IAI Lavi fighter aircraft, and producing a fire-control system for the Merkava tank. 1996 IPO on NASDAQ In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies: * Elbit Medical Imaging ‚Äì During 1999 to 2000 Elscint (Another affiliate of Elron) and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million. * Elbit Systems ‚Äì Created as the defence electronics arm of Elbit, the company had an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock market with the symbol NASDAQ:ESLT and finished its first day of trading at a price of $7.75. Elbit Systems has a market cap of over $5 Billion. * Elbit ‚Äì which focused on communications activities and in 1999 led the consortium that founded Partner Communications Company, Israel's first GSM operator . In 2002, Elbit was merged into Elron. Elron sold its shares in Partner during 2003‚Äì2006 for approximately $160 million. Merger with El-Op In 2000, Elbit Systems merged with El-Op (a company controlled by the current Chairman, Michael Federmann), creating the largest non governmental defense electronics company in Israel and increasing Elbit Systems' value which later in 2004 enabled Elron to sell its shares in Elbit Systems for approximately $200 million. Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann became the largest shareholder in the combined group. Growth by acquisition Following the merger with El-Op, Michael Federmann and CEO Joseph Ackerman led an aggressive growth by acquisitions strategy. The company acquired companies, including: * Elisra * Tadiran Communications * Shiron Satellite Communications * BVR Systems * Assets of Israel Military Industries‚Äô Aircraft Systems Division * Innovative Concepts, Inc. * Mikal Ltd (the company initially purchased 19% of the firm, and later agreed to acquire Mikal's 100% holdings in Soltam Systems and Saymar and the 87.85% portion of ITL held by Mikal, in exchange Mikal's owners received the 19% of Mikal that Elbit had purchased) Elbit subsequently announced a cash tender offer for the 12.15% remainder of ITL held by the public. Recent news In October 2014, Elbit Systems won a $12.7 million contract for the supply and provision of Apache Aviator Integrated Helmets for the US Army helicopter fleet.

The project is to be performed within 24 months. Italy ‚Äì On June 22, 2011, Elbit announced that it was awarded a contract valued in excess of $15 million by Elettronica S.p.A to participate in a program to supply the ELT/572 DIRCM (Directed Infra-Red Countermeasures) system for installation on various platforms of the Italian Air Force, including the C130J, C27J and AW101. The contract is to be performed over the next three years. North Macedonia - In February 2004 Elbit System started modernization of 4 helicopters (two transport MI17, and two attack helicopters MI24V) in Air Base Petrovec for Macedonian Air Force with equipment (ANVIS/HUD-24) for flight and combat in night environments. On May 11, 2011, Ministry of Defence signed a contract for building a training center for pilots with simulators (Full Mission Sumulator, FMS) for MI17 and MI24 helicopters. Simulators was produced by Romanian Company Simultec ownership of Elbit Systems, On March 2, 2014, centar was opened with ceremony led by President of Republic Of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, Premier of Republic Of Macedonia Nikola Gruevski, ex-minister from Ministry of Defence and other guests. Romania ‚Äì Elbit Systems' activities in Romania, which started in 1996, are primarily carried out through its wholly owned Romanian subsidiaries, Elbit Systeme S.A., A-E Electronics S.A, Elmet International SRL and Simultec SRL, which employ approximately 400 employees. On May 24, 2011, Elbit announced that it was awarded a contract valued at approximately $18.6 million to upgrade the Romanian Air Forces' C-130 transport aircraft. According to the agreement, the C-130 aircraft will be installed with various types of advanced electronic systems, including those produced by Elbit Systems' wholly owned subsidiary ‚Äì Elisra Electronic Systems Ltd. The project, to be performed over four years, will be executed in cooperation with local companies in Romania, led by the Romanian Aeronautical Industry. United Kingdom ‚Äì In 2005 Elbit set up a joint venture company in the UK with Thales, UAV Tactical Systems Ltd (U-TacS), developing the British Army Watchkeeper WK450. On December 7, 2007, it was announced that QinetiQ will join the programme as a sub-contractor to provide testing services at ParcAberporth, West Wales. In 2007, Elbit acquired Ferranti Technologies (Group) Limited. North America United States ‚Äì Elbit owns several companies in the United States through its American subsidiary, Elbit Systems of America (ESA): *EFW in Fort Worth, Texas (the EFW facility also houses ESA's home office) **EFW manufactures various components for the F-16, V-22, and Bradley Fighting Vehicle, among other programs. It was initially the electronics manufacturing facility for General Dynamics operations in Fort Worth; when GD sold its aviation business to Lockheed Martin the latter was not interested in the facility which was then sold to Elbit. *IEI in Talladega, Alabama (formerly International Enterprises, Inc.) *Kollsman Inc. in Merrimack, New Hampshire (founded in 1928 by Paul Kollsman, who invented barometers and instrument flight in airplanes) **Kollsman is a subcontractor to Boeing on SBInet, a high-tech security system for the U.S.-Mexico border in conjunction with the United States Department of Homeland Security. *Talla-Com in Tallahassee, Florida *Innovative Concepts, Inc. (ICI) in McLean, Virginia, purchased in November 2008 from Herley Industries *VSI in San Jose, California (a joint venture with Rockwell Collins, formerly known as Vision Systems International; Elbit and Rockwell Collins each own 50%) *UAS Dynamics in Fort Mill, South Carolina (originally a 50‚Äì50 joint venture with General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products; on December 1, 2011, Elbit purchased GD's 50% share) *M7 Aerospace in San Antonio, Texas *ESA completed the purchase of the Night Vision division (Roanoke, VA) from L3Harris on September 15, 2019 South America Brazil ‚Äì In 2001, Aeroeletronica (AEL), a Brazilian company that had more than two decades of experience in the defense industry has become a part of the Elbit Systems Group. In January 2011, Elbit announced that it had bought two more Brazilian companies: Ares Aeroespecial e Defesa, and Periscopio Equipamentos Optronicos. In April 2011, Embraer has entered into a strategic agreement with AEL Sistemas S.A (‚ÄúAEL‚Äù), a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Systems. The two companies were yet to define the specific programs to be pursued but, according to officials from the two companies, the main goals of the cooperation were the expanding of joint activities in the area of unmanned aircraft systems, including the anticipated creation of a jointly owned company, with majority participation of Embraer D&S.; One of the primary goals of the joint venture will be to promote the introduction and use of Elbit Systems Hermes 450 UAV in the service of the Brazilian Air Force. Colombia ‚Äì In March 2010, a $28 million contract for Hermes 450 UAVs was suspended by the Colombian government after media reports based on anonymous letters alleged that Colombian officials had been bribed. The Israeli Ministry of Defense investigated and found that the letters likely came from Israel Aerospace Industries, a competitor that lost the tender. The incident led to a review of the regulations governing overseas competition between Israeli defense companies. Southeast Asia Philippines - Elbit won its first contract in the Philippines for the supply of upgraded armored personnel carriers to the Philippine military back in June 2014. The upgrade included 25mm unmanned turrets, 12.7 mm remote controlled weapon stations (RCWS) and fire control systems (FCS) for 90 mm turrets. The contract marks a significant breakthrough for Elbit Systems, as it is the first one awarded to the company in the Philippines. In 2015, the Armed Forces of the Philippines received 114 M113 tracked APCs from the United States. The improved version of M113A2 APCs will have Remote Control Weapons System (RWS) designed by Elbit Systems. The electronically driven turrets can be configured with various types of cannons (25mm/30mm), coaxial machine guns (7.62mm) and guided anti-tank missiles.  Spyware  On 6 December 2017, Citizenlab published a detailed report that showed that Ethiopian dissidents and journalists in the US, UK, and other countries were targeted by sophisticated commercial spyware, sold and operated by Cyberbit, a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Systems. In a reply to an inquiry from Human Rights Watch on the topic, Cyberbit did not deny selling this kind of technology, and rejected the responsibility of its possible misuse on its customers. Divestment On September 3, 2009, the Norwegian Pension Fund's ethical council decided to sell the fund's stocks in Elbit due to the corporations supply of surveillance systems for the Israeli West Bank barrier. At a press conference to announce the decision, Minister of Finance Kristin Halvorsen said \\"We do not wish to fund companies that so directly contribute to violations of international humanitarian law\\". The Norwegian Ambassador to Israel was called to a meeting at the Israeli Foreign Ministry where the decision was protested. In January 2010, Danske Bank added Elbit to the list of companies that fail its Socially Responsible Investment policy; a bank spokesman noted that it was acting in the interests of its customers by not 'placing their money in companies that violate international standards'. The Danish financial watchdog Danwatch has also placed Elbit on its ethical blacklist, and one of Denmark's largest pension fund administrators PKA Ltd announced it will no longer consider investing in Elbit, stating \\"The ICJ stated that the barrier only serves military purposes and violates Palestinian human rights. Therefore we have looked at whether companies produce custom- designed products to the wall and thus has a particular involvement in repressive activities.\\" In March 2010, a Swedish pension fund not wanting to be associated with companies which in its opinion are violating international treaties, boycotted Elbit Systems for being involved in constructing the Israeli West Bank barrier. In April 2019, the publication of a report entitled AXA: Financing War Crimes by SumOfUs highlighted that AXA's investment subsidiary, AXA Investment Managers, a French investment firm, divested from Elbit in December 31, 2018. However, the same study notes that their affiliate AXA Equitable Holdings maintains investment in the company.

He was best known for his comedy roles. He was credited in 40 films between 1948 and 1971, and on television from 1960 until his death. He was often cast as a police inspector or as a navy or army officer, or for his comedy roles in Ealing and other British films. Biography=Early life and military service Born in Liverpool of Irish descent, Gregson grew up in the city's Wavertree area, where he was educated at Greenbank Road Primary School and later at St Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool. He left school at 16, working first for a telephone company, then for Liverpool Corporation, as the city council was then known, before the Second World War. During this time, he became interested in amateur dramatics, joining first the local Catholic church theatre group at St Anthony's in Mossley Hill. When war broke out, Gregson was called up and joined the Royal Navy as a sailor on minesweepers. At one point, his minesweeper was torpedoed and he was rescued from the sea with a knee injury. Early postwar career After being demobilised in 1945, he joined the Liverpool Playhouse for a year, before going on to Perth Theatre in Scotland. There he met his future wife, actress Ida Reddish from Nottingham (at the time using the stage name Thea Kronberg, though she later became Thea Gregory) who had recently arrived from the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. They moved to London in 1947, and married there. They eventually had three daughters and three sons. He appeared alongside Alec Guinness in the play The Human Touch in the West End. One of his first appearances was in the film Saraband for Dead Lovers (1948), a tearjerking romance starring Joan Greenwood and Stewart Granger. In the popular Scott of the Antarctic (also 1948) he played Tom Crean. Gregson could also be seen in Ealing's Whisky Galore! (1949) and Train of Events (1949), as well as The Hasty Heart (1949), Cairo Road (1950), Treasure Island (1950) and The Lavender Hill Mob (1951). He had a lead role in Angels One Five (1951), a war film. He was promoted to leading man for The Brave Don't Cry (1952), about a mining disaster. Gregson had the second lead in Rank's Venetian Bird and supported in The Holly and the Ivy (both 1952). He also had a leading role in another Ealing comedy, The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Stardom Gregson became a star when cast in the comedy Genevieve (1953), also starring Kenneth More, Dinah Sheridan and Kay Kendall. It was the second-most popular film of the year in Britain. He was second-billed to Glynis Johns in a prison drama, The Weak and the Wicked (1954), another hit, and played the lead in a light drama, Conflict of Wings (1954). He followed this with The Crowded Day (1954), a comedy; To Dorothy a Son (1954), a comedy co-starring Shelley Winters; and Three Cases of Murder (1955), an omnibus film co-starring Orson Welles. Gregson had a big hit with a war film, Above Us the Waves (1956), playing an Australian, in support of John Mills. He did a comedy with Diana Dors, Value for Money, and a drama Jacqueline (both 1956). More successful was another war movie based on a true story, The Battle of the River Plate (1956) in which Gregson played F. S. Bell. This film helped British exhibitors vote him the eighth-biggest British film star in the country for 1956.The Most Popular Film Star In Britain.\\" Times [London, England] 7 December 1956: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012. He followed it with True as a Turtle (1957), a comedy; and Miracle in Soho (1957), a drama. That year he was the fourth-biggest British star.BRITISH ACTORS HEAD FILM POLL: BOX-OFFICE SURVEY', The Manchester Guardian (1901‚Äì59) [Manchester (UK)] 27 December 1957: 3. The following year he was eighth, his last year in the top ten; his films included Rooney (1958), a comedy in which he played an Irish sportsman; Sea of Sand (1958), a war film; and The Captain's Table (1959) a comedy. He supported in SOS Pacific and Hand in Hand (both 1960), but was top-billed in Faces in the Dark (1960) and The Frightened City (1961). He had a support role in The Treasure of Monte Cristo (1961) and was one of many names in The Longest Day (1962). Gregson's final film roles of note were Live Now, Pay Later (1962) and Tomorrow at Ten (1962). Later career His film career faded after ten good years [1952‚Äì1962]'.D. Quinlan, Quinlan's Illustrated Directory of Film Stars (1986 edition), p.179. He was one of many leading men and women of the 1950s (the others including Kenneth More, Richard Todd, Patrick Holt, Michael Craig, Sylvia Syms and Muriel Pavlow) who struggled to maintain their status as leads beyond the early 1960s. From 1963 onwards, Gregson never played another leading film role. Gregson also worked on TV. In Ivor Brown's BBC TV play William's Other Anne he played William Shakespeare revisiting his first girlfriend Anne Whateley.Thespis, Plays, Films, Television, English, Summer 1953; 9: 179 ‚Äì 18 TV work became increasingly important to him from the mid-60s. He starred as Commander George Gideon in the 26 episodes of the series Gideon's Way (1965‚Äì66) (known as Gideon C.I.D. in America). He also appeared in The Saint with Roger Moore and a popular comedy adventure series with Shirley MacLaine, Shirley's World. He took over from Kenneth More in long-running TV adverts for coffee on British television. He appeared in It's the Geography That Counts, the last play at the St James's Theatre before its closure in 1957. Death John Gregson died suddenly from a heart attack near Porlock Weir, Somerset, aged 55, whilst on holiday, walking on the path to St. Beuno's Church, Culbone. He left a widow, Thea Gregory, and six children. His final television role was in the Southern Television serial Dangerous Knowledge, which was broadcast posthumously in 1976.

It is the second largest ski resort east of the Mississippi in terms of skiable area ( after Killington's ) and snowmaking percentage (95%); its continuous vertical drop of is the second longest in New England (after Killington's ). Sugarloaf recorded a total of 352,000 skier visits in the 2005‚Äì2006 season, ranking it second among Maine resorts and 11th in New England. At 4,237 feet (1291 m) Sugarloaf Mountain is third in elevation to Maine's highest peak, Mount Katahdin. It is second to Hamlin Peak, an adjacent spur of Mt Katahdin. The summit of Sugarloaf offers the only lift-serviced above-treeline skiing in the Northeast. The Appalachian Trail crosses within of Sugarloaf's peak and the summit offers 360-degree views of Maine's western mountains and New Hampshire's White Mountains.National Park Service, comp. \\"Appalachian Trail.\\" Map. As of October 2020, there were over of marked trails and a total of of developed trails. There were of skiable area boundary to boundary. The thirteen chairlifts have the capacity to carry 21,810 skiers per hour. There are also 154 marked trails and glades, most of which are named after logging terms in a tribute to Maine's logging history. Trails include thirty-four rated as green circle (25%), forty-four blue square (32%,), thirty-nine black diamond (28%), and twenty-one rated double black diamond (15%). There are also thirty named glades, and three terrain parks. Lifts include two SuperQuads, three high-capacity quads, five doubles, one triple, one T-bar, and one carpet surface lift. The Sugarloaf season runs from mid-November through early May. left History=The Beginnings: 1950‚Äì1960 The first trail was cut at Sugarloaf in 1950 by the Sugarloaf Mountain Ski Club and a group of locals known as \\"The Bigelow Boys\\". Led by Amos Winter, along with Stub Taylor, they transformed the mountain into what is today one of the largest ski areas in the Northeast. The founding of the mountain was called for by the US ski association. Thy hired Pheous Sprague to find a mountain in Maine. Initially, they planned to have the mountain on the Bigelow mountain range, but when Flagstaff Lake was made the plans had to be scrapped. Phin Sprague then found Amos and Stub which knew of a mountain called Sugarloaf. Many documents relating to the founding and early years now reside at the Ski Museum of Maine in Kingfield, Maine. In the summer of 1950 Sugarloaf Mountain Ski Club was formed and club member Amos Winter and many volunteers helped cut the first trail up Sugarloaf Mountain, appropriately named Winter's Way. It wound down the Mountain with a 1,800 vertical foot drop and was cut in many places across the hill. Amos noted later that this trail was flawed in its design. In 1952, the first of many ski races was held on Winter's Way. In 1953 a rope tow was installed up the lower part of Winter's Way, which was a gentle slope and could be used by beginners and intermediates, while it helped take a few steps out of the hike for experts. In the summer of 1955 the ski club issued stock and formed the Sugarloaf Mountain Corporation and the first T-Bar was installed. It ascended some 900 vertical feet from the base (a warming hut) and was capable of carrying some 600 skiers per hour. The Narrow Gauge trail was cut to skiers' left and Sluice to skiers' right. A year later in the summer of 1956 another Constam T-Bar was purchased and installed. This T-Bar ran from the top of the first T-bar up into the snowfields another away (This T-bar is in the same place as the current #3 T-bar is today, and the first T-bar was in the place of current \\"Long Side\\" or Double Runner West). In the summer of 1959 the base area was relocated some down the hill. A two-story lodge was built and another T-bar added to service the beginner area. Sugarloaf/USA: 1960‚Äì1971 1962 season pass \\"The Mighty Gondola\\", pictured sometime in the early 1970s During the summer of 1961 the #4 and #5 T-bars were installed on the east side of the mountain. They opened up the area that is now called Whiffletree and King Pine Bowl. As of late 1961 electricity only went as far south as Sugarloaf (from the south through Rangeley via Rangeley Power Company Lines west to Eustis, and then south into Carrabassett Valley). The efforts of Leo Tague, a motel owner, brought power to the valley in the beginning of that winter. During the summer of 1964 it was decided to install a lift made by Polig-Heckel-Bleichert. In the summer of 1965, Sugarloaf installed \\"The Mighty Gondola\\", a four-passenger PHB, aerial lift, rising convert 2350 vertical feet to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain. In the summer of 1969 the first chairlift was installed to the west of Tote Road. The chairlift, Bucksaw (which was taken down in 2015), carried 945 passengers per hour up 1,200 vertical feet and over a mile. It opened up new intermediate terrain referred to now as West Mountain. The second chairlift was installed in 1970 when Sugarloaf Mountain Corporation (SMC) bought the Sugarloaf Inn. This lift, Sawduster, was installed to carry passengers from the Inn to the Base Lodge. The Tall Timber Classic is an alpine race course held on Sugarloaf's Narrow Gauge Trail. It has hosted the World Cup (1971) and three U.S. Nationals (1996) (2006) (2008) events, along with many other Downhills and Super-G's. Statistics for the Tall timber classic include a men's downhill vertical drop of and length of ; a women's downhill vertical drop of and length of ; a men's giant slalom vertical drop of and length of ; and a women's giant slalom vertical drop of and length of . Growth and expansion: the 1970s Condominiums built during the 70s During the early 1970s there was a lack of snowfall throughout the Northeast. This event and the 1967 Oil Embargo a few years earlier would set Sugarloaf on a path towards bankruptcy a decade later. This lack of snowfall did have some positive effects however - snowmaking was installed. In 1973 Sugarloaf was unable to make any snow for December. Saddleback, located in nearby Rangeley, Maine did however have snowmaking (it was limited to the Wheeler Slope). On October 26, 1971, the residents of then Jerusalem Township voted 21‚Äì13 to incorporate and create the town of Carrabassett Valley, Maine. The first town meeting was held the next year on April 26, 1972. Crocker and Wyman Townships declined to join Jerusalem township at first, but Crocker township joined the next year. The town would play a huge role in the development of Sugarloaf/USA and the nearby Sugarloaf Outdoors Center. Valley Crossing was built by the Airport, where the Fire Station, Town Hall, and many other local government and private buildings are located. The Valley Crossing Complex included ski shops, restaurants, condos, and commercial shops. Due to its location, however, the entire Complex was moved up to the base of Sugarloaf. In the summer of 1972 WTOS-FM \\"The Mountain of Pure Rock\\" radio station out of Skowhegan, Maine began transmitting from a radio tower perched on the top of Sugarloaf Mountain. In the summer of 1973 two more lifts were installed, Double Runner East and West. They replaced the #2 T-Bar and were extended down further to be closer to the base lodge. They were both Borvig Double Chairs. They both had an uphill capacity of about 1,200 passenger per hour, and the two lifts are and . These lifts are both still in use today. Because of the lack of snow for the 1973-74 season, SMC decided to install snowmaking. The first trail to have snowmaking installed was Narrow Gauge, where it was installed top to bottom. That same summer the Spillway Chairs were installed. Spillway East, rated one of New England's best double chairs, stretched about long with a vertical rise of , and could carry about 1,200 passengers per hour. The #3 T-Bar is still in operation today and operates on busy days and when the wind is too strong to allow for the Spillway Chairs to run. With all the new real estate development and an increase in skier days, the power supply was becoming a problem. This changed however in 1975 when Rangeley Power Company was purchased by Central Maine Power (CMP). CMP built a new transmission line from the Wyman Hydro Dam in Moscow, Maine. Additionally, Carrabassett Valley annexed Sugarloaf Township (formerly Crocker Township). Mountainside Corporation and the Appalachian Trail A view from the rerouted A.T. Several important developments occurred in the late 1970s. On June 25, 1976, Mountainside Corporation was created to take charge of developing and marketing real estate development on Sugarloaf. Mountainside sold the Sugarloaf Inn to Peter Weber. Mountainside is responsible for the condos built along Buckboard off Whiffletree, and many other projects important to Sugarloaf's growth. During this summer, the Appalachian Trail was moved from the summit of Sugarloaf, to over the summit of Crocker Mountain. In 1978 a fleet of Pisten Bullies was purchased for grooming; this became necessary because of the lack of natural snow. Larry Warren, appointed President in spring of 1979, negotiated the purchase of of land on the adjoining, Burnt Mountain, for future lift and trail development. At the end of the 1970s, Sugarloaf/USA had an uphill capacity of more than 9,000 skiers per hour. The 1980s and 90s With the help of Peter Weber, a golf course, designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr, was constructed at the resort. At the same time, the Carrabassett Valley Academy was also founded. The cost of building new real estate and overruns, along with the lack of natural snow and snowmaking, put SMC in debt. In the year 2000, Sugarloaf/USA officially celebrated its 50th anniversary. The celebrations included a new color scheme which included orange, introduced for the year. In just fifty years Sugarloaf had moved from a mountain with just one trail, to one with over one-hundred- and-thirty trails, fourteen lifts, and had hosted World Cups, U.S. Nationals, and many other ski and snowboard events (Pictured is the Sugarloaf Logo with the orange scheme).Portland Press Herald Online . New ownership: 2007‚ÄìPresent Abandoned gondola building, March 2016 In August 2007 Sugarloaf was sold by American Skiing Company to CNL Lifestyle Properties, to be managed by Boyne Resorts. CNL/Boyne also purchased Sunday River, another Maine ski area owned by ASC. Under new management, the resort promptly began performing overdue maintenance and upkeep that had begun to be neglected during lean ASC years. This included dismantling the old Gondola mid-station building, re-painting and maintaining lifts, towers, and buildings that were showing signs of neglect, and making significant upgrades to the resort's snowmaking system.Sugarloaf (Press Release) 17 August 2007, Retrieved 12 December 2008 Boyne Resorts also removed the \\"USA\\" from \\"Sugarloaf/USA.\\" Boyne also installed the Moosecalator, a Magic Carpet, on The Birches Slope. During the Summer of 2008, Sugarloaf saw more than $5 million in offseason upgrades, including all new pumps for the snowmaking system, 25 new Boyne Low-E fan guns, and 50 low energy HKD tower guns. The resort also installed all new trail signage, replaced old, run-down lift shacks with new lift building, and completely redesigned its Terrain Parks, including a new snowboardcross course designed by Olympian Seth Wescott. The resort also saw a significant expansion to its on-mountain restaurant, Bullwinkle's. In the fall of 2009, Sugarloaf and Boyne, with the help of Olympic gold medalist Seth Wescott are trying to team up with the town to help purchase a new \\"signature lift\\". Seth Wescott presented a proposal during a town meeting to see if the town would help finance for a new $10 million gondola that would run the same path as the original gondola. This led to the announcement of the resort's ten-year plan, which was revealed in September 2010, going by the name Sugarloaf 2020. This plan announced expansion of sidecountry glade terrain into Brackett Basin and Burnt Mountain, areas controlled by the resort for years that were only rumored for expansion. Sugarloaf 2020 also announced many new upgrades to the mountain's snowmaking and lift systems. Lifts listed for potential upgrade included the Spillway, Double Runner, Timberline, and West Mountain chairlifts. As for new lifts, the \\"signature lift\\" was listed as well as a T-Bar that would run from the top of the #3 T-Bar to the summit. Brackett Basin would open immediately for Winter 2010-2011. A crew of 12 men worked clearing 60 acres of terrain from the top of the King Pine chair directly to the east of the existing Cant Dog Glade, introducing Cant Dog 2, Birler, Edger, and Sweeper Glade. Glades were woven together and emptied out at the bottom of the King Pine chair. Low angle terrain sat beneath the King Pine chair and was cleared down to the bottom of Lower Stub's, offering run outs via the Sugarloaf Nordic Center to the Snubber chair or by crossing Mountainside Road through local condominium complexes to the Whiffletree chair. Logging companies were given the opportunity to log the lower terrain. The glades opened in Winter 2010 down low included Rough Cut, Red Horse, High Ball, and Blacksmith Glade, as well as the Logging Road. The Brackett Basin project was completed in co-ordination with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection so as to protect environments home to endangered species such as the Bicknell's Thrush. On January 19, 2011, the terrain accessible via the King Pine chair opened for the first time. As a result of the derailment of the Spillway East chair, it was announced that in the summer of 2011 a new fixed-grip quad chairlift would replace the aged Spillway lift. That work was completed and the Skyline lift, a $3 million Doppelmayr carpet- loading fixed-grip quad chair, opened during the 2011-12 season. The construction process started on April 19 with chair removal on Spillway West. Spillway East continued to run until May 1. Demolition of the old Spillway chair was complete by the end of June. Construction of the new Skyline chair was completed by November 17 when the load test was conducted. Also for the 2011 ski season cutting began on phase two of the Burnt Mountain Expansion and the Drive system in the SuperQuad was upgraded from analog to digital. On Burnt Mountain, the existing Brackett Basin section saw additional trimming and cutting while the glade traverse was added this year into Phase 2. This traverse, called the Golden Road, started a hiking trail over the ridge between Sugarloaf and Burnt Mountain, offering higher entrances to Birler, Edger, and Sweeper, as well as the furthest down entrance into the Eastern Territory, a logged area mixed with glades and skidder roads on the western and northern facing, low-lying slopes of Burnt Mountain. The Eastern Territory did not open in 2011-12 as more clearing needed to be done in the summer of 2012. In addition to clearing the Eastern Territory in 2012, the entrance to Brackett Basin was improved to minimize skier backups and exposure of rocks and brush through the snow. The main additions of the offseason included the purchase of 300 low-energy HKD snowguns, remodeling the ski shop and renaming it the Downhill Supply Company, as well as implementing a $1.4 million irrigation system on the golf course. In 2013, 200 more low-energy HKD snowguns were purchased and a new snowmaking line was put in on Gondola Line. In terms of guest experience, the lodge saw improvements to the Mountain Magic area for beginner skiers, a newer and larger hot tub was put in at the Sugarloaf Mountain Hotel and the renovation of the new restaurant 45 North was completed. Additionally, the Upper West Mountain trail was widened in sections for ski team usage. Off to the skier's left of West Mountain, Greenhorn Glade was cut as a sidecountry experience, starting as a glade opening up into logged terrain as the pitch levels out, the run dumps out above the West Mountain developments. On Burnt Mountain, Phase 3 was started with the first glade cut off the summit, Androscoggin Glade, only accessible via the Burnt Mountain hiking trail at the end of the Golden Road, dumping into the Eastern Territory as a run out. It covers 68 acres and 1200 vertical feet. A new glade was cut on the main mountain as well off the skier's right on Upper Gondola Line called Gondi Glade. Finally, land was acquired off the backside of the mountain that locals had been skiing for years. These runs known as Awesome, Adrenaline Rush, Hell's Gate, and Ball and Chain offered extreme skiing with cliff drops from the backside runout to the Brackett Basin traverse in the King Pine area. In 2014, snowmaking improvements were conducted on Slasher, to improve connection points on the eastern part of the mountain, and 40 new low- energy HKD snowguns were purchased. A new winch cat was purchased and a new tuning machine was bought to modernize operations in the ski shop. The Sugarloaf Mountain Hotel lobby was upgraded. A new 10-acre glade, Slashfire, was cut in Brackett Basin off the Golden Road to the east of Sweeper, which dumps into the bottom of Sweeper Glade near the \\"Sweeper Bridge\\". The 2014-15 ski season was also the first in which the village was completely pedestrian friendly. Vehicular traffic was eliminated, moving the bus drop off in front of the base lodge near the Birches Slope instead of in the village between the lodge and the hotel. During the 2015-16 season, a new Doppelmayr terminal was installed at the King Pine lift due to a roll back issue that occurred the previous season. In addition, the Bucksaw lift that had long served the West Mountain area was taken off-line and dismantled due to old age. In summer 2016, the competition center was re-built and expanded as a state of the art facility. This process removed the old gondola building which the center called home, effectively removing suspicions that a \\"signature lift\\" would be constructed. That summer, a cut off from Androscoggin Glade was cut called Little Androscoggin Glade. In 2016, CNL sold its ski resorts; Sugarloaf was sold to Och-Ziff Capital Management. In 2017, cat skiing on Burnt Mountain was announced. Starting from the log yard, the cat will travel up Burnt Mountain on the boundary line near Androscoggin Glade to the top of Burnt Mountain. Kennebec Glade was cut in 2018 to introduce another run off of Burnt Mountain. In 2019, Sugarloaf added their first beginner's glade area to the map, Alice's Winter Land Glade, opening access to the woods beneath the Skidway chair for the first time. In addition, the Widowmaker Lounge was renovated. Some upgrades included re-locating the bar and the stage, as well as providing better utilization of the upstairs space by adding deck access. The Narrow Gauge snowmaking line was upgraded to a 12 inch line, a new air line was put in at the Timbers, and new Klik hydrants were put in on early season trails, such as Hayburner, King's Landing, and Candy Side. A new bullwheel was placed on Snubber's base terminal and a new haul rope was spliced on the Skidway chair. Boyne purchased the resort from Och-Ziff Capital Management in March 2018, along with sister resorts Sunday River and Loon, to gain full control of the mountain with the hopes of funding more on-mountain projects. As 2020 approached, many of the announced capital improvements in the 10-year plan, Sugarloaf 2020, were not fulfilled under CNL ownership. With Boyne now holding much of the mountain, and the passage of time, new plans for capital improvements were announced at the 2019 Homecoming Meeting. Among Boyne's goals in coming years is expansion of snow-making with Caribou Pond as a new water source. That project has been approved to start in 2020. Initial construction will focus on re-constructing the dam at Caribou Pond, then in future years providing transportation of water from the pond to the mountain and the golf course for snowmaking and irrigation, respectively. This new system will greatly increasing the mountain's snowmaking capacity. Other proposed improvements include a new Timberline Quad, with the possibility of extension to Bullwinkle's. Additionally, development on West Mountain of a new chair, parking lot, tubing park, Bullwinkle's access road, and short golf course. Finally, a yurt at the top of Whiffletree was proposed to provide on- mountain restrooms on the east side of the mountain. Accidents On December 28, 2010 the Spillway East double chair derailed, sending some passengers on a fall. The accident injured 8 people and was blamed on a misaligned cable. At least one lawsuit against Sugarloaf was filed in regards to the incident. On March 21, 2015 the King Pine quad chair experienced a rollback, seriously injuring 7 skiers, including 3 children, when a chairlift malfunctioned. Four taken to the hospital. Summer activities Sugarloaf offers many on-mountain summer activities such as golf, hiking, mountain biking, ziplines, and court sports such as tennis and basketball. Public transportation The Sugarloaf Explorer is a free public transportation system that services the resort. It features eight bus routes linking residential neighborhoods, condominiums, inns, and hotels in Carrabassett Valley with the Sugarloaf Base Lodge, the Outdoor Center, and local shops and restaurants.Sugarloaf Explorer There are no regular service coach buses, commercial airline flights, or rail service to the mountain. The closest bus service is Augusta (80 miles), which is served by Greyhound Lines and Concord Coach Lines. The closet commercial airline service is also Augusta, which is only served by Cape Air. However, Portland International Jetport in Portland (134 miles) is served by eight different airlines, including low-cost carriers such as JetBlue and AirTran Airways. Amtrak also serves Portland, with five round-trip trains daily on the Downeaster.Grayhound RoutesU.S. Airways RoutesPortland International JetportAmtrak Downeaster Mascots Sugarloaf is home to three mascots: Amos the Moose, Blueberry the Bear and Pierre the Lumberjack.

Many boxing historians consider Wills the most egregious victim of the \\"color line\\" drawn by white heavyweight champions. Wills fought for over twenty years (1911‚Äì1932), and was ranked as the number one challenger for the throne, but was denied the opportunity to fight for the title. Of all the black contenders between the heavyweight championship reigns of Jack Johnson and Joe Louis, Wills came closest to securing a title shot. His managers included Jim Buckley and Paddy Mullins. Boxing career Wills in France in 1920 Wills fought many of the top heavyweights of his era. He defeated Willie Meehan, who had decisioned Jack Dempsey, Gunboat Smith and Charley Weinart. He also fought Luis Firpo in a match that ended in No Decision. Wills faced future heavyweight champion Jack Sharkey in 1926, and was being decisively beaten when he was disqualified. The next year, Wills was knocked out by heavyweight contender Paolino Uzcudun in a bout that signalled the end of his reign as a serious title contender. His final record was 75 wins (with 47 knockouts), 9 losses and 2 draws. In 2003, he was named to the Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. The top black fighters of Wills' era were forced to continuously fight each other, as many white fighters also drew the \\"color line\\". As a result, Wills fought the redoubtable Sam Langford 22 times. His record against Langford was 6 wins, 2 losses and 14 No Decisions, although the two losses were by knockout. He beat Langford three times for the colored heavyweight title, with Langford winning it back twice. (He was forced to vacate his third title when he fought Jack Sharkey in 1926 and was lost the bout due to a disqualification.) Wills also defeated colored heavyweight champ Sam McVey three times and fought two No Decision bouts with Joe Jeanette. Aborted 1926 Dempsey-Wills heavyweight title match Midwestern boxing promoter Floyd Fitzsimmons rendered a check to Wills for his fee, but failed to produce even a downpayment for Dempsey's much larger fee for a bout between the two fighters, who had, in July 1925, signed an agreement for a 1926 title match, which never materialized as a result. Disagreement has existed among boxing historians as to whether Dempsey had avoided Wills‚Äîthough Dempsey swore he was willing to fight him‚Äîas having said he would no longer fight Black boxers after winning the title.

It is a first-person dungeon crawler game with pre-rendered environments, digitized characters and live-action cinematic sequences. Repeatedly delayed, the game that was supposed to be finished in nine months took five years to make. Gameplay Stonekeep is a first-person role-playing game in the style of Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master. The game is set in a series of underground labyrinths, filled with monsters, treasures and traps. The player uses the keyboard for movement and typing in notes in the journal, and the mouse to interact with objects and characters. The mouse pointer is usually a target indicator for aiming attacks and weapons wherever it is clicked. When the mouse pointer is moved onto a particular something it changes to another icon to indicate a different action. For example, the mouse pointer changes to an eye when the player can examine things (often signs), or a spread-out hand when the player can pick up items. Other tasks performed with the mouse pointers include opening and closing chests, opening and closing panels, pulling levers and switches, pressing buttons, drinking water, and giving items. Fighting the Ice Queen The protagonist Drake has two starting possessions: the magic scroll and the magic mirror. The magic scroll allows the player to pick up an infinite number of items. Items of the same type can be combined together up to a maximum quantity of 99; other items can be combined together such as a quiver which can hold 99 arrows. The magic mirror allows the player to equip Drake and other characters with weapons, armor, and accessories, and to consume items to affect their status, such as healing potions or bad smelling Throg food. Drake can also read scrolls used on him. Although Drake can wield any weapon, other characters like Farli and Karzak can only wield hammers, axes, and shields. Certain weapons like polearms and heavy swords require Drake to have two free hands to wield. Some armor can be worn by certain characters. For instance, only dwarves can wear dwarven platemail, and only Drake can wear knight armor. Exceptional characters like Sparkle and Wahooka cannot be outfitted, but can still consume items. The third possession is the journal, which the player must procures. The journal is divided into six sections. The first section records the statistics of Drake, shows the status of his current equipped weapons, and describes the characteristics of his partners. Drake's statistics are strength, agility, and health, and his weaponry skills include polearm, sword, magick, missiles, and others. The second section of the journal records any clues and hints the player may come across. The third section is used for writing notes. The fourth section records items each time the player picks up a new type. The fifth section records runes each time the player comes across a new one. Unlike the items section, the runes do not have their own respective name recorded. The sixth section of the journal records the level maps that the players journeys through. Spots on the map can be clicked and notes referring to them can be written. Stonekeep features an elaborate \\"magick\\" system where four types of runes are inscribed onto a spellcaster (wand): Mannish, Fae, Throggish, and Meta. The first three runes are used for offensive, defensive and special interaction purposes. The Meta runes enhance the effectiveness of the base runes‚Äîfor example, double power multiplies a single firebolt in two. To use a spellcaster, it must contain adequate mana, and runes must be inscribed onto its shaft. To inscribe runes on the spellcaster, the player needs to equip the spellcaster on either one of Drake's hands, open the journal onto the Runes section, take out the spellcaster, and copy the runes onto the spell slots of the spellcaster. Then the runecaster can be taken out at any time and the spell that can be used has the spell slot highlighted and launched on the indicated target point. Using the magic mirror, some spells can be aimed at the characters, especially healing and quickness spells. Plot Stonekeep's mythology revolves around a variety of gods associated with planets of the solar system. In order, they are Helion (Mercury), Aquila (Venus), Thera (Earth), Azrael (Mars), Marif (Jupiter), Afri (Saturn), Saffrini (Uranus), Yoth-Soggoth (Neptune) the Master of Magick, and Kor-Soggoth (Pluto) the Brother to Magick. These gods were captured and imprisoned in nine orbs by the dark god Khull-Khuum 1000 years before the events of the game, during a cataclysm referred to as \\"The Devastation\\". Stonekeep is centered on a hero, Drake. Ten years before the events of the game, Drake's home, the castle of Stonekeep, was destroyed by the insane god Khull-Khuum, the Shadowking. Drake, at this time just a boy, was saved from the castle by a mysterious figure. Returning to the ruins of Stonekeep, Drake is visited by the goddess Thera, who sends his spirit out of his body into the ruins itself to explore, find the mystical orbs containing the other gods, and reclaim the land. Along the way, Drake makes many friends, including Farli, Karzak, and Dombur the dwarves; the great dragon Vermatrix; the elf Enigma; and the mysterious Wahooka, the King of goblins. Together, they embark on a quest of ridding the world of Khull-Khuum and his consort the Ice Queen. Development=Budget and technology The earliest development of Stonekeep dated back in October 1988, discussed between Brian Fargo and Todd Camasta with the simple title \\"Dungeon Game\\". Producer Peter Oliphant and lead programmer Michael Quarles joined the company in 1990 and 1991, respectively. The game development was planned for a minimum period of nine months and a minimum budget of $50K. However, because the initial stages of the game looked good, it exceeded nine months, lasting a total of five years. Stonekeeps final cost was $5 million; its production crew had grown to 200 members by the time of the game's release. The intro sequence was the most expensive part of the production, costing nearly half a million dollars to produce, which was ten times more than the initial budget for the entire project. The initial story line was written by Oliphant, who also designed and programmed the graphics and artificial intelligence engine for the game. The project started out being called Brian's Dungeon (named after Brian Fargo, the president of Interplay Entertainment at the time). Fargo came up with the final name, Stonekeep. The production took much longer than expected because of the rapid advancement of personal computer hardware at the time; specifically, PC CPUs advancing from 80386, to 80486, to Pentiums in the years the game was being developed. Oliphant, who originally designed the game and was lead programmer, left the game as the project passed its fourth year in development. He felt his continued presence was resulting in the constant addition of feature creep and changes (he was a contractor, and had initially only signed up for a nine-month project). After he left, the design became finalized and the product was shipped one year later. Quarles, who was an Interplay employee, stayed as the game's producer and saw it through to the end. The initial specification for the game included that it could not require a hard drive or a mouse, run on an 80286 CPU, use 640K, and run off floppy disks. At the project's end, the game had been upgraded to requiring a mouse, a hard drive, a 386 CPU, and ran off CD-ROM. As a result, the engine had to be extensively modified throughout the production. About three years into the project, Oliphant suggested to Fargo that the product be delivered on CD-ROM. Fargo rejected this idea at the time, citing the failure of previous Interplay CD-ROM projects that had gone this route. Oliphant suggested this after Fargo requested him to drop his percentage of royalties by half due to the high cost of production and goods to create the product, as it was at that time to be shipped on eight floppy disks. The cost of one CD was about the cost of one floppy disk, and the possibilities for eight floppy disks having problems is much greater than a single CD, so the solution seemed obvious to Oliphant. And, in fact, six months later Fargo changed his mind and made the same decision. Graphics and audio The 3D rendering was accomplished by using the Strata Vision application to create the room layouts, monsters, and objects. The initial motions of the monsters in the game were captured by using a blue screen outside with the sunlight. This resulted in uneven lighting from take to take, so eventually all that work was scrapped. Later, a professional studio with controlled lighting was used. The earliest film footage was taken with a standard film camera and Macintosh computer for editing. This technology proved to be inadequate. After two years of failed filming, the team turned their attention to Hollywood. Aided by the production company Dia Quest and new digitizing technology, successful filming was finally implemented into the project. The entire five months of successful filming was soon met with several setbacks including toning, lighting, and digitization problems. When the team finally obtained the Betacam technology, the development was back on track. According to Oliphant, when the project was taken over by Quarles, two questionable decisions were made. The game was always designed to be grid-based, where the player moved from grid to grid (in contrast to today's full freedom of motion 3D environments). Oliphant wanted the movement from center of grid to center of grid, but Quarles changed this to edge of grid to edge of grid. This resulted in the problem that turning within a grid moved the player to the other side of the grid. Much of the long production was a result of correcting this lack of symmetry. The other questionable decision was to not include Oliphant in the production of the motion graphics (Oliphant had an extensive Hollywood background before becoming a game developer). One consequence was that the original combat graphics had been captured from the waist up only, as Quarles had reasoned one must be close to a monster to fight it. Peter Oliphant, upon being delivered these graphics and seeing them for the first time, pointed out that the player could back away during a fight, which would result in seeing their legs. The legs therefore had to be drawn in by hand frame-by-frame to fix this, until these graphics were scrapped for a professional green-screen treatment used later on. The original skeleton in the game was an actual skeleton being worn by one of the artists, and was filmed against a green screen. Because of this, there were no images or animations of the skeleton walking away from the player during game play. A few months before the game's release the skeleton was replaced with the 3D model which was used on the packaging. Due to the complexity of the graphics, during play the computer would have to constantly load graphics from the CD. This prohibited the use of the CD for music, so the developers used chip music for the soundtrack. The game features the voice of Arthur Burghardt‚Äîwell known as the character Destro in the 1985 G.I. Joe cartoon series‚Äîin the role of Khull-Khuum. Stonekeep was originally released for the PC DOS and Windows 95 in 1995, packaged in an elaborate gravestone- style illustrated box, and came with a white hardback novella Thera Awakening, coauthored by Steve Jackson and David L. Pulver (all rights of the novel went to Interplay). The CD-ROM also included a file called \\"muffins.txt\\" which contained a recipe for \\"Tim Cain's Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Muffins\\". Years later, Stonekeep was later made available for purchase through GOG.com's digital distribution system for Windows XP and Windows Vista. Reception=Sales In preparation for Stonekeeps launch, Interplay shipped 175,000 units to retailers. This was the company's biggest shipment ever, according to Greg Miller of the Los Angeles Times. Interplay dedicated $1.5 million to the game's marketing budget, also the largest for any of its games by that point. In response to public reception of Stonekeeps pre-release demo, the company \\"stepped up the initial release forecast to 200,000 units\\". In the days before Stonekeeps release, Next Generation reported, \\"With store orders already topping 90,000, Interplay says it's set to become the fastest selling game in the company's 12-year history.\\" Upon its release, the game placed fourth on PC Data's monthly computer game sales chart for November 1995, but was absent on the following month's chart. According to Interplay, its global sales surpassed 300,000 copies by June 1998. Author Erik Bethke later described Stonekeeps commercial performance as \\"weak\\", which he blamed on its five-year development cycle. Critical reviews A Next Generation critic deemed it \\"well worth the wait. The graphics are stunning, the music is eerie, and the interface is a pleasure to use.\\" He made particular note of the automap, strong puzzle element, and original visual designs for the monsters. Maximum praised the game's \\"atmospheric 3D rendered world\\" and sound effects, but criticized the lack of challenging puzzles, low amount of gore, and \\"sluggish\\" combat. The editors of Computer Games Strategy Plus named Stonekeep the best computer role-playing game of 1995. Petra Schlunk of Computer Gaming World called Stonekeep \\"successful on many levels; both hard-core and newcomers to role-playing should enjoy this.\\" She wrote that \\"a lot of thought and heart went into the game's design and production\\", and she singled out its writing, characters and storyline for praise. The game was later nominated for Computer Gaming Worlds 1995 Role-Playing Game of the Year award. The editors praised it as \\"a milestone in computer role-playing games\\", with \\"beautiful SGI rendered characters and fascinating story development\\", but noted that it was held back by bugs. It won the magazine's readers' choice award in its genre. PC Gamer USs Mike Wolf called it \\"a decent offering for roleplaying novices [... but] far from the magnum opus you'd expect\\". A review by Bernard Yee of GameSpot did not offer similar praises, concluding that \\"Stonekeep is a dated first- person RPG that suffers from a poor interface, little depth, and few frills.\\" In Fusion, Arnie Katz called Stonekeep \\"a good antidote to the idiosyncratic complexities that pass for depth\\" among role-playing games, and praised its interface and audiovisual presentation. He summarized it as \\"an exciting quest that doesn't concede much to rival RPG releases.\\" Paul Presley of PC Zone called Stonekeep \\"a case of gloss but no substance\\", which failed to offer \\"something over and above that which Eye of the Beholder was delivering all that time ago.\\" Andy Butcher reviewed Living Legends for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that \\"Although the 'plot' as such is somewhat weak, and the game quickly falls into an 'explore the level, kill the monsters, solve the puzzles' affair, Stonekeep is engaging and surprisingly addictive.\\" In 1996, editors of Computer Gaming World ranked it as the tenth top vaporware title in computer game history (due 1991, delivered 1996), stating that \\"after seeing the same basic demo for years, the game finally shipped, as an anti-climax.\\" Stonekeep was also ranked at number six on GameSpot's top ten vaporware hall of shame. In 2009, GamesRadar also included Stonekeep among the games \\"with untapped franchise potential\\" due to the cancelation of Stonekeep 2: Godmaker.123 games with untapped franchise potential, GamesRadar US, April 30, 2009 Legacy The Oath of Stonekeep, a novel set in the world of Stonekeep, was written by Troy Denning and published 1999 by Berkley Boulevard Books. Interplay's Black Isle Studios worked on a sequel, Stonekeep 2: Godmaker, for roughly five years, before eventually cancelling it in 2001 in order to work on Icewind Dale II and Baldur's Gate III: The Black Hound. The game and its novelization would remain the only entry in its series until the 2010 announcement of Stonekeep: Bones of the Ancestors, a game developed for Interplay by Alpine Studios. It is not a sequel to Stonekeep, but rather an all-new game and a standalone entry in the franchise. Bones of the Ancestors was released in 2012 as downloadable content at WiiWare.

Located on the corner of HaPalmach Street in Katamon, down the road from the Jerusalem Theater, it houses Islamic pottery, textiles, jewelry, ceremonial objects and other Islamic cultural artifacts. History The museum was founded by Vera Bryce Salomons, daughter of Sir David Lionel Salomons, in memory of her professor, Leo Aryeh Mayer, rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a scholar of Islamic art who died in 1969. It has nine galleries organized in chronological order, exploring the beliefs and art of Islamic civilization. In addition to Mayer's private collection, the museum houses antique chess pieces, dominoes and playing cards; daggers, swords, helmets; textiles; jewelry; glassware, pottery and metalware produced in Islamic countries, from Spain to India. A collection of Islamic carpets was added in 1999.Frommer's review of L.A. Mayer Museum of Islamic Art Rare clock collection A gallery in the museum also displays the David Salomons clock and watch collection. Salomons was the nephew of the first Jewish Lord Mayor of London.Horomundi On 15 April 1983, some 200 items, including paintings and dozens of rare clocks and watches, were stolen when the museum was burgled. Among the stolen timepieces was the watch known as the \\"Marie Antoinette\\", the so-called \\"Mona Lisa\\" of watches, and the crown jewel of the watch collection, made by the famed French-Swiss watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet reputedly for Queen Marie Antoinette, and estimated to be worth US$30 million. It was part of a unique collection of 57 Breguet timepieces donated to the museum by the daughter of Sir David Lionel Salomons, one of the leading experts on Breguet. The case remained unsolved for more than 20 years. In August 2006, a Tel Aviv antiques appraiser contacted the museum and reported that some of the stolen items were being held by a Tel Aviv lawyer whose client had inherited them from her deceased husband, and who wished to sell them back to the museum. The original asking price was US$2 million (the value of the reward offered in the case) but this was negotiated down to US$35,000. Among the returned items was the \\"Marie Antoinette\\" and a valuable \\"Sympathique\\" clock, also by Breguet. A later search of a warehouse in Israel produced documents that led to safety deposit boxes owned by Na'aman Diller in Israel, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. Police identified the client as Nili Shamrat, an expatriate Israeli who had married Diller in 2003. She told police that, just before her husband's death in 2004, he confessed and advised her to sell the collection. Shamrat was arrested in May 2008, after a house search by Israeli and American investigators found several of the stolen clocks, some rare 18th-century paintings, and catalog cards bearing the name of the clocks and their manufacturers. On November 18, 2008, French and Israeli police officials discovered 43 more stolen timepieces in two bank safes in France. Of the 106 rare timepieces stolen in 1983, 96 have now been recovered. On April 3, 2010, Shamrat was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and given a five-year suspended sentence for possession of stolen property.

Its name is a French term (\\"cat-cry\\" or \\"call of the cat\\") referring to the characteristic cat-like cry of affected children. It was first described by J√©r√¥me Lejeune in 1963. The condition affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 live births across all ethnicities and is more common in females by a 4:3 ratio. Signs and symptoms The syndrome gets its name from the characteristic cry of affected infants, which is similar to that of a meowing kitten, due to problems with the larynx and nervous system. About one third of children lose the cry by age of 2 years. Other symptoms of cri du chat syndrome may include: * feeding problems because of difficulty in swallowing and sucking; * low birth weight and poor growth; * severe cognitive, speech and motor disabilities; * behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, aggression, outbursts and repetitive movements; * unusual facial features, which may change over time; * excessive drooling; * small head (microcephaly) and jaw (micrognathism); * widely-spaced eyes (hypertelorism); *skin tags in front of eyes. Other common findings include hypotonia, a round face with full cheeks, epicanthal folds, down-slanting palpebral fissures (eyelids), strabismus, flat nasal bridge, down-turned mouth, low-set ears, short fingers, single palmar creases and cardiac defects (e.g., ventricular septal defect [VSD], atrial septal defect [ASD], patent ductus arteriosus [PDA], tetralogy of Fallot). Infertility is not associated with Cri du chat. It has also been observed that people with the condition have difficulties communicating. While levels of proficiency can range from a few words to short sentences, it is often recommended by medical professionals for the child to undergo some sort of speech therapy/aid with the help of a professional. Less frequently encountered findings include cleft lip and palate, preauricular tags and fistulas, thymic dysplasia, intestinal malrotation, megacolon, inguinal hernia, dislocated hips, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, rare renal malformations (e.g., horseshoe kidneys, renal ectopia or agenesis, hydronephrosis), clinodactyly of the fifth fingers, talipes equinovarus, pes planus, syndactyly of the second and third fingers and toes, oligosyndactyly and hyper extensible joints. The syndrome may also include various dermatoglyphics, including transverse flexion creases, distal axial triradius, increased whorls and arches on digits and a single palmar crease. Late childhood and adolescence findings include significant intellectual disability, microcephaly, coarsening of facial features, prominent supraorbital ridges, deep-set eyes, hypoplastic nasal bridge, severe malocclusion and scoliosis. Affected females reach puberty, develop secondary sex characteristics and menstruate at the usual time. The genital tract is usually normal in females, except for a report of a bicornuate uterus. In males, testes are often small, but spermatogenesis is thought to be normal. Exceptionally, some with Cri du chat are very high-functioning and do not seem very different from developmentally typical individuals, with mostly the exception of mild learning difficulties, and do not have speech difficulties, although they may have milder facial features and a high-pitched voice due to their condition. Genetics Cri du chat syndrome is due to a partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome number 5, also called \\"5p monosomy\\" or \\"partial monosomy.\\" Approximately 90% of cases result from a sporadic, or randomly occurring, de novo deletion. The remaining 10‚Äì15% are due to unequal segregation of a parental balanced translocation where the 5p monosomy is often accompanied by a trisomic portion of the genome. These individuals may have more severe disease than those with isolated monosomy of 5p. A recent study suggests this may not be the case where a trisomy of chromosome 4q is involved. Most cases involve total loss of the most distant 10‚Äì20% of the material on the short arm. Fewer than 10% of cases have other rare cytogenetic aberrations (e.g., interstitial deletions, mosaicisms, rings and de novo translocations). The deleted chromosome 5 is paternal in origin in about 80% of de novo cases. Loss of a small region in band 5p15.2 (cri du chat critical region) correlates with all the clinical features of the syndrome with the exception of the catlike cry, which maps to band 5p15.3 (catlike critical region). The results suggest that 2 noncontiguous critical regions contain genes involved in this condition's cause. Two genes in these regions, Semaphorine F (SEMA5A) and delta catenin (CTNND2), are potentially involved in cerebral development. The deletion of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene localized in 5p15.33 may contribute to the phenotypic changes in cri du chat syndrome as well. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on the distinctive cry and accompanying physical problems. These common symptoms are quite easily observed in infants. Affected children are typically diagnosed by a doctor at birth. Genetic counseling and genetic testing may be offered to families with individuals who have cri du chat syndrome. Prenatally the deletion of the cri du chat related region in the p arm of chromosome 5 can be detected from amniotic fluid or chorionic villi samples with BACs-on-Beads technology. G-banded karyotype of a carrier is also useful. Treatment There is not a specific way to treat the condition as the brain damage caused by this condition occurs in the early stages of embryo development. Intensive treatment is rarely needed in infants and they can be treated in neonatal pathology departments. Children may be treated by speech, physical and occupational therapists. If infants have difficulty in suction or swallowing, then physical therapy should begin in the first weeks of life. Heart abnormalities often require surgical correction and specialist attention.  Prognosis  Once the child has survived the first few years of life, the prognosis is good and the mortality level is low. In a series of case reports, the mortality rate was about 10%, 75% of deaths occurring within 3 months of birth, and 90% within the 1st year.

The Magic Mushrooms were originally composed of five students from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. They were: *Joe LaCavera (Drums) *Stu Freeman (Vocals and Guitar) *Ted Cahill (Lead Guitar and Autoharp) *Dick Richardson (Keyboards) *Charles Ingersol (Bass) The Magic Mushrooms came together shortly after they started their freshman year and practiced in the freshman commons until they started playing gigs. They named themselves the Magic Mushrooms after Allen Ginsberg suggested that name during an on-campus lecture in the fall of 1965. In the Spring of 1966, they were joined by Josh Rice (Vocals, Flute, Harmonica), who had been the lead singer of a competing band on the Penn Campus, and 2 or 3 months after Josh arrived, Dick and Charles left the band, and were replaced by Bob Grady and Chris Barbieri, on keyboards and bass, both of whom had been in a band with Stu for a couple years previously. The band was heard by Sonny Casella while playing at Drexel University later in the Fall and he signed on as the Manager shortly thereafter. They played mostly around the Philadelphia area into the Spring of 1966, most of their bookings being arranged by their new manager. Their first single, \\"It's A-Happening\\" was released in September 1966, which reached number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for one week in November of that year before dropping off.http://www.song-database.com/chhist.php?sid=19671 It was included on the Nuggets compilation in 1972. \\"It's A-Happening\\" was written by Stu Freeman and Josh Rice. Sonny Casella produced, arranged and mixed the song. When Herb Alpert of A&M; Records found out what \\"magic mushrooms\\" were, he pulled the record off the market because the band would not change their name. They are not to be confused with The Magic Mushroom, a different American psychedelic garage rock band from San Diego who happened to release their one and only single (I'm Gone b/w Cry Baby) the same year.

It was discovered on 3 September 1980, by Czech astronomer Anton√≠n Mrkos at Kle≈• Observatory near ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice in the Czech Republic. The asteroid was named after author of children's books, Roald Dahl.  Orbit and classification  Dahl orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.4‚Äì3.1 AU once every 4 years and 6 months (1,653 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at the US Goethe Link Observatory in 1949, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 31 years prior to its discovery.  Physical characteristics  Dahl has been characterised as a dark, carbonaceous C-type asteroid.  Lightcurves  In November 2011, a rotational lightcurve of Dahl was obtained by Brett Waller at the Cedar Green Observatory in Virginia in the United States. It gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.43 in magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Dahl measures 19.6 kilometres in diameter and its surface has an low albedo of 0.034, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 16.8 kilometres, as the higher the albedo (reflectivity), the lower a body's diameter for certain absolute magnitude.  Naming  This minor planet was named in memory of the Welsh author Roald Dahl (1916‚Äì1990), known for his classic children's books Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 28 August 1996 ().

It was recorded as a demo in 1975 but released in altered form in November 1977 by record label Bomp!.  Background  \\"Johanna\\" and \\"I Got Nothin'\\" were both performed live during 1973‚Äì74 by the Williamson-era Stooges.  Recording  Kill City was originally recorded in 1975 after the disintegration of the Stooges. It was to be used as a demo to give to record labels in hopes of getting Pop a new contract. His vocals were recorded on weekends when he received permission to leave a mental hospital he was staying in at the time for treatment of his long-standing heroin addiction. The original 1975 \\"demo\\" mix of the album remains unheard, with the exception of three tracks which have been released on various compilations (including A Million in Prizes: The Anthology and Original Punks): \\"Johanna\\", \\"Consolation Prizes\\" and \\"Kill City\\". These tracks sound markedly different from those on the final version of the album, with different guitar parts and, in the case of \\"Johanna\\", no saxophone.  Release  There would be no takers for the album until 1977 when, following the success of Pop's solo albums The Idiot and Lust for Life, Williamson got an advance from Bomp! to release the album, some of which was used to fund studio time to finish off the original recordings by adding overdubs and remixing. The master tapes were lost shortly after the release of the original album and all subsequent CD releases were mastered from the original poor quality green vinyl pressing. This partly accounts for the somewhat muddy sound of the album. Pop appeared as himself, performing the album's title track, on the \\"For Cryin' Out Loud\\" episode of the Tales from the Crypt TV series, aired on May 22, 1990. In 2010, Williamson and engineer Ed Cherney remixed the album once more from the original multitracks. The resulting mixes formed a new version of the album, released on Bomp! on October 19, 2010.  Reception  Kill City has been generally well received by critics. Nick Kent of New Musical Express called it \\"a great album\\". Mark Deming of AllMusic called the album \\"a minor triumph\\", writing: \\"The music is more open and bluesy than on Raw Power, and while Williamson's guitar remains thick and powerful, here he's willing to make room for pianos, acoustic guitars and saxophones, and the dynamics of the arrangements suggest a more mature approach after the claustrophobia of Raw Power\\". Martin Aston of BBC Music praised the album, calling it \\"Iggy's most underrated album\\" and one that \\"helped him get back to real life\\".  Legacy  'The Wire' placed Kill City in their list of \\"100 Records That Set the World on Fire (While No One Was Listening)\\".

The network was dedicated to covering financial markets and business news, similar to CNBC. It was available in a number of markets, including the U.S. and Australia. In Canada, much of its content was aired on ROB TV (now BNN). After years of struggling to attract an audience, Time Warner folded CNNfn in late 2004. On some U.S. cable television systems, its slot was given to CNN International on a full-time basis; previously, CNN International filled CNNfn's schedule in late nights and weekends. However, many cable companies ended their carriage of the channel and did not take CNN International, though it is available through the CNN website and mobile app with TV Everywhere credentials. CNN continues to maintain a business news vertical on digital platforms, now known as CNN Business. The vertical was originally CNNMoney‚Äîa partnership with the Time Warner-owned financial magazines Fortune and Money. The partnership was folded after Time Warner spun out its publishing assets (and subsequently sale to Meredith Corporation). Network history In 1995, Lou Dobbs and Ted Turner were having heated internal discussions about the direction of CNN. Dobbs was able to convince Turner that letting him start a new channel would be a way to solve both issues. Turner would keep Dobbs working for CNN while giving him his own network to run. In July 1999, Dobbs quit CNNfn and started his own company, Space.com, and eventually returned to CNN to host Lou Dobbs Tonight. From the start, CNNfn struggled to be picked up by local and national cable operators. In 2004, the official CNNfn network was shut down. However the technologies invented in the early CNNfn days helped launch CNN and the entire broadcasting industry into a new digital era. The CNNfn.com website continued on, and in 2001 merged with Money Magazine to form CNNMoney. Schedule The schedule below is taken from the now-defunct site of CNNfn as at 2001 (only from Monday to 12 am on Friday). All the times ET.

Show (re-broadcast) * 5:30am - Moneyline (re-broadcast) Technological advances CNNfn inaugurated many innovations on TV and online. Many of these helped the Internet and broadcasting industry become what they are today. Just a few of these accomplishments include: *The first fully digital studio in the world. From the digital cameras to the production room and beyond, the CNNfn network was the first fully digital professional broadcasting studio. Unlike all other studios at the time, CNNfn could control all cameras with a single joystick. CNNfn claimed the joystick operator was a computer-trained worker, not a camera operator. To make this happen, CNNfn worked closely with Avid Systems in creating some of their own first generation broadcasting solutions. Additionally CNNfn and Avid Systems worked with Apple Computer to create a hacked version of the Mac operating system as no other system at that time could handle the throughput requirements of real-time digital video editing. Due to these advancements, CNNfn had many issues with labor unions. The unions claimed that the joystick operator should be worth four times as much as a normal camera operator and thus unionized workers should be paid accordingly. *The first online stock quote engine. CNNfn worked with S&P; Comstock and Townsend to convert what was then a special direct connection to the stock market into a real-time data feed that could be used by the CNNfn.com website. Prior to this, ticker symbol lookups were typically reserved for private firms and not generally available. *The first automated on-air stock ticker. Although other broadcasters were showing a moving ticker, the data from these were edited and keyed in manually. Therefore, the lag time in the data being displayed to a view was unpredictable. CNNfn was the first to automatically tap into the ticker feed and create an engine that would \\"auto-select\\" hot stocks and otherwise prioritize the display to show the most relevant stocks. *The first with advertising campaign management. The online advertising market was just being invented while CNNfn's website was being launched. Prior to CNNfn, the online advertising market primarily used weighting for ad rotations. This would provide a specific advertiser a percentage of views for each page the ad was displayed. CNNfn worked with industry leader NetGravity to develop the first policy engine that would allow CNNfn.com to target advertisements based on user demographics. *The first to utilize streaming media with broadcast video. At the time, RealNetworks, VDONet, and VXtreme were startups in the streaming media space. No broadcaster saw the Internet as a viable way to reach their audience and they all believed their content to be too valuable to broadcast over the Internet for free. In late 1996, CNNfn.com published 1‚Äì2 hours of its programming each day within minutes after the actual show had aired on TV. *The first to utilize Layer 7 load balancing to scale. At the time, round- robin DNS with weighted nodes to account for servers with more or less power or connectivity was the only way to scale a web farm. CNNfn was working closely with Netscape by also helping the write portions of their software which was incorporated into their 2.x product line. Round robin was not fast enough at taking a server out of rotation when Netscape would crash. Thus CNNfn worked with a few vendors to implement a Layer 7 solution that would instantly know when a server was up or down. This dramatically increased the speed and quality of the CNNfn and CNN websites. *The first to fully automate publishing. By working with Lotus Software, CNNfn was the first to use a database back-end system to automate the work flow of a publishing system. At that time, even The Wall Street Journal, another startup, used web masters to hand convert articles from the editors into HTML and to get them approved by hand through e-mail or visual confirmation from a manager. The web master would then post the story onto the website and edit the referring page to add a link to the new document. CNNfn worked with Lotus's Domino product to fully automate the draft, approval, and publishing of its articles. The website was completely automated in re-writing its static home page with the latest stories. As an industry first, this method was published in a few major magazines and studies by others. Within months after its initial deployment, CNN revamped its own website's publishing methods and reduced its webmasters from 15 to 3. In the summer of 1996 the top two technology members of Lou Dobb's team, Sam Edge and Nils Lahr, threatened to quit CNNfn if changes were not made to allow them more creative control in implementing new technologies. Additionally, they wanted some level of credit and increased internal recognition through proposed promotions. Dobbs tried to keep these key members of the team at CNNfn by offering them higher wages and even went as far as to suggest that he would create an entire company dedicated to high-technology research in connection with Gartner such that the advancements that were made would become knowledge that could be sold to others. However Dobbs was unable to make this happen quickly inside of CNN as there was resistance from Turner and others. In late 1996, Edge moved to CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, and Lahr left to join the startup VXtreme (which was later purchased by Microsoft and became what is now the Windows Media). Dobbs made a last-ditch attempt to keep Nils inside CNN by attempting to sue him, claiming there were \\"important\\" and \\"unfinished\\" duties that required his attention at CNNfn. The lawsuit, however, was thrown out and Lahr was allowed to leave. Shortly after Dobbs quit CNNfn and as promised started his own company Space.com.

The Walt Disney Company dispute Altice engaged in a dispute with The Walt Disney Company; the contract to carry the company's channels was set to expire on October 1, 2017. On October 1, 2017, Disney and Altice reached a last-minute agreement to continue carrying the company's channels; this narrowly averted what would have been a blackout of ABC-owned stations WABC-TV and WPVI-TV, along with the ESPN family of networks and various other channels. As part of the agreement, ESPN Classic was removed from the Altice lineup. Starz dispute On January 1, 2018, Altice dropped Starz, Starz Encore, and all of their channels from its channel lineup. The dispute came after the companies were unable to reach an agreement. The dispute ended on February 13, 2018 after both companies reached a new multi-year agreement. 21st Century Fox dispute On September 22, 2018, 21st Century Fox announced that all of its entertainment and sports channels, including Fox owned-and-operated station WNYW and MyNetworkTV O&O; WWOR-TV, would be removed from Altice on October 1 if a new retransmission agreement was not reached by that date.

He made his first film appearance in 1928 and subsequently became a familiar face in British and occasionally American films until his death. He appeared less often on television, but many of his films have remained popular and are often shown. He acted in two adaptations of A. J. Cronin's novels, The Citadel (1938) and The Stars Look Down (1940), in addition to appearing in The Lady Vanishes (1938) and Under Capricorn (1949). Both of these latter films were directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Other roles were in Storm in a Teacup (1937), The Weaker Sex (1948), 23 Paces to Baker Street (1956), Dangerous Moonlight (1941), Swiss Family Robinson (1960), and I Was Monty's Double (1958), as well as the comedies A French Mistress (1960), The Ladykillers (1955), The Man in the White Suit (1951), The Court Jester (1955) (in which he played an evil, usurping king of England), Indiscreet (1958) and I Believe in You (1952). Parker was also the original Charles Condomine in the West End production of No√´l Coward's Blithe Spirit. He often played a touchy senior officer or British upper class character, and his last two films were true to form: The Magnificent Two (1967) with the British comedy double act Morecambe and Wise and Richard Attenborough's version of Oh! What a Lovely War (1969). He played an evil, scheming butler on one episode of The Avengers (\\"The ¬£50,000 Breakfast\\"). In 1957 he played Dr. Morelle in BBC radio series, \\"A Case for Dr. Morelle\\" (13 episodes). Personal life Parker was married to Muriel Anne Randell-Brown (born 20 August 1899, Seacombe, Cheshire died 1985), from September 1927 until his death in 1971, in Brighton.

(or NAC or NACorp) is a printing, delivery and advertising company jointly owned by the Deseret Morning News and The Salt Lake Tribune, the two major daily newspapers in Salt Lake City, Utah. History Starting in 1948 long-time rivals the Deseret News and The Salt Lake Tribune, along with several newspapers in the country, were experiencing financial troubles. The News had begun an aggressive plan to win new subscribers, including improving content as well as offering prizes to new readers. The Deseret News had been floundering for years while The Salt Lake Tribune controlled market share, although the Tribune still felt economic pressure. Rising printing costs also contributed to this decline. In 1952 the two papers worked out a 30-year agreement, known as the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA). The agreement, founding the NAC, combined the expenses of press, advertising, circulation and mechanical departments, while still maintaining separate newsrooms. Longtime Tribune publisher John F. Fitzpatrick was the architect of the NAC. He approached his friend and LDS President David O. McKay with the idea. Fitzpatrick's brainchild, the JOA would ensure the continuation of the News while keeping the dominant position of the Tribune in the state. Without this agreement the Deseret News may have fallen into ruin after a failed subscription promotional effort. The agreement also allowed the Tribune to sell its lackluster afternoon paper, the Salt Lake Telegram to the News, which was then an evening paper. The Telegram promptly ceased publication. There was much confusion early on; many people confused joint presses with joint newsrooms. Adding to this confusion, beginning in 1952 the Deseret News stopped printing a Sunday edition. News subscribers would receive a Sunday copy of the Tribune instead. The NAC was the subject of congressional antitrust investigations during the 1960s, but in 1970 Richard Nixon signed the Newspaper Preservation Act, protecting the NAC. The JOA was renewed in 1982. The agreement negotiated between publishers Wendell J. Ashton of the Deseret News and John W. Gallivan of The Salt Lake Tribune, allowed the Deseret News to print a Sunday paper again.\\"Deseret News to start Sunday Edition in 1983,\\" Deseret News, May 19, 1982 The new agreement is in effect until 2012. In a move thought to be an embrace of the \\"convergence\\" of newspaper, radio, television and the Internet, NAC is planning to change its name to \\"Media One,\\" thereby ridding itself of the notion that it is solely dedicated to the production of only newspapers. However the confusion carried over from the NAC still exists with most advertisers and subscribers alike. References *Woodward, Don C., ed.

It was published in 1916, after Saussure's death, and is generally regarded as the starting point of structural linguistics, an approach to linguistics that flourished in Europe and the United States in the first half of the 20th century. One of Saussure's translators, Roy Harris, summarized Saussure's contribution to linguistics and the study of language in the following way: Although Saussure was specifically interested in historical linguistics, the Course develops a theory of semiotics that is more generally applicable. A manuscript containing Saussure's original notes was found in 1996, and later published as Writings in General Linguistics. Semiology: langue, langage, and parole Saussure distinguishes between \\"language (langue)\\" and \\"speech (langage)\\". Language is a well-defined homogeneous object in the heterogeneous mass of speech facts. Speech is many-sided and heterogeneous: it belongs both to the individual and to society. Language is a self-contained whole and a principle of classification: it is social. Language is not complete in any speaker: it is a product that is assimilated by speakers. It exists only within a collective. Language is \\"a system of signs that express ideas\\". To explain how the social crystallization of language comes about, Saussure proposes the notion of \\"individual speaking (parole)\\". Speaking is willful and intentional. While individual speaking is heterogeneous, that is to say composed of unrelated or differing parts or elements, language is homogeneousa system of signs composed of the union of meanings and \\"sound images\\", in which both parts are psychological. Therefore, as speech (langue) is systematic, it is this that Saussure focuses on since it allows an investigative methodology that is \\"scientific\\" in the sense of systematic enquiry. Beginning with the Greek word sem√Æon meaning \\"sign\\", Saussure proposes a new science of \\"semiology\\": \\"a science that studies the life of signs within society\\". The sign The focus of Saussure's investigation is the linguistic unit or sign. The sign (signe) is described as a \\"double entity\\", made up of the signifier, or sound pattern (referred to by Saussure as a 'signal'), and the signified, or concept (referred to by Saussure as 'signification'). The sound pattern is a psychological, not a material concept, belonging to the system. Both components of the linguistic sign are inseparable. One way to appreciate this is to think of them as being like either side of a piece of paper ‚Äì one side simply cannot exist without the other. The relationship between signifier and signified is, however, not quite that simple. Saussure is adamant that language cannot be considered a collection of names for a collection of objects (as it is in the conception that Adam named the animals, for example). According to Saussure, language is not a nomenclature. Indeed, the basic insight of Saussure's thought is that denotation, the reference to objects in some universe of discourse, is mediated by system-internal relations of difference. Arbitrariness For Saussure, there is no essential or natural reason why a particular signifier should be attached to a particular signified. Saussure calls this the \\"arbitrariness of the sign\\" (l'arbitraire du signe). Fig. 2 ‚Äì Arbitrariness No two people have precisely the same concept of \\"tree,\\" since no two people have precisely the same experiences or psychology. We can communicate \\"tree,\\" however, for the same reason we can communicate at all: because we have agreed to use it in a consistent way. If we agreed to use the word and sound for \\"horse\\" instead, it would be called \\"horse\\" to the same effect. Since all that is important is agreement and consistency, the connection is arbitrary. In further support of the arbitrary nature of the sign, Saussure goes on to argue that if words stood for pre- existing universal concepts they would have exact equivalents in meaning from one language to the next and this is not so. Languages reflect shared experience in complicated ways and can paint very different pictures of the world from one another. To explain this, Saussure uses the word b≈ìuf as an example. In English, he says, we have different words for the animal and the meat product: Ox and beef. In French, b≈ìuf is used to refer to both concepts. In Saussure's view, particular words are born out of a particular society's needs, rather than out of a need to label a pre-existing set of concepts. But the picture is actually even more complicated, through the integral notion of 'relative motivation'. Relative motivation refers to the compositionality of the linguistic system, along the lines of an immediate constituent analysis. This is to say that, at the level of langue, hierarchically nested signifiers have relatively determined signified. An obvious example is in the English number system: That is, though twenty and two might be arbitrary representations of a numerical concept, twenty-two, twenty-three etc. are constrained by those more arbitrary meanings. The tense of verbs provides another obvious example: The meaning of \\"kicked\\" is relatively motivated by the meanings of \\"kick-\\" and \\"-ed\\". But, most simply, this captures the insight that the value of a syntagm‚Äîa system-level sentence‚Äîis a function of the value of the signs occurring in it. It is for this reason that Leonard Bloomfield called the lexicon the set of fundamental irregularities of the language. (Note how much of the \\"meaningfulness\\" of the Jabberwocky poem is due to these sorts of compositional relationships!) A further issue is onomatopoeia. Saussure recognised that his opponents could argue that with onomatopoeia there is a direct link between word and meaning, signifier and signified. However, Saussure argues that, on closer etymological investigation, onomatopoeic words can, in fact, be unmotivated (not sharing a likeness), in part evolving from non-onomatopoeic origins. The example he uses is the French and English onomatopoeic words for a dog's bark, that is ouaoua and Bow Wow. Finally, Saussure considers interjections and dismisses this obstacle with much the same argument, i.e., the sign/signifier link is less natural than it initially appears. He invites readers to note the contrast in pain interjection in French (aie) and English (ouch). Value The value of a sign is determined by all the other signs in the langue. Fig. 3 ‚Äì Value Saussure realized that if linguistics was going to be an actual science, language could not be a mere nomenclature; for otherwise it would be little more than a fashionable version of lexicology, constructing lists of the definitions of words. Thus he argued that the sign is ultimately determined by the other signs in the system, which delimit its meaning and possible range of use, rather than its internal sound-pattern and concept. Sheep, for example, has the same meaning as the French word mouton, but not the same value, for mouton can also be used to mean the meal lamb, whereas sheep cannot, because it has been delimited by mutton. Language is therefore a system of interdependent entities. But not only does it delimit a sign's range of use, for which it is necessary, because an isolated sign could be used for absolutely anything or nothing without first being distinguished from another sign, but it is also what makes meaning possible. The set of synonyms redouter (\\"to dread\\"), craindre (\\"to fear\\"), and avoir peur (\\"to be afraid\\"), for instance, have their particular meaning so long as they exist in contrast to one another. But if two of the terms disappeared, then the remaining sign would take on their roles, become vaguer, less articulate, and lose its \\"extra something\\", its extra meaning, because it would have nothing to distinguish it from. This is an important fact to realize for two reasons: (A) it allows Saussure to argue that signs cannot exist in isolation, but are dependent on a system from within which they must be deduced in analysis, rather than the system itself being built up from isolated signs; and (B) he could discover grammatical facts through syntagmatic and paradigmatic analyses. Syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations Language works through relations of difference, then, which place signs in opposition to one another. Saussure asserted that there are only two types of relations: syntagmatic and paradigmatic. The latter is associative, and clusters signs together in the mind, producing sets: sat, mat, cat, bat, for example, or thought, think, thinking, thinker. Sets always involve a similarity, but difference is a prerequisite, otherwise none of the items would be distinguishable from one another: this would result in there being a single item, which could not constitute a set on its own. These two forms of relation open linguistics up to phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics. Take morphology, for example. The signs cat and cats are associated in the mind, producing an abstract paradigm of the word forms of cat. Comparing this with other paradigms of word forms, we can note that in the English language the plural often consists of little more than adding an s to the end of the word. Likewise, in syntax, through paradigmatic and syntagmatic analysis, we can discover the grammatical rules for constructing sentences: the meaning of je dois (\\"I should\\") and dois je? (\\"Should I?\\") differ completely simply because of word order, allowing us to note that to ask a question in French, you only have to invert the word order. A third valuation of language stems from its social contract, or its accepted use in culture as a tool between two humans. Since syntagmas can belong to speech, the linguist must identify how often they are used before he can be assured that they belong to the language. Synchronic and diachronic axes To consider a language synchronically is to study it \\"as a complete system at a given point in time,\\" a perspective he calls the AB axis. By contrast, a diachronic analysis considers the language \\"in its historical development\\" (the CD axis). Saussure argues that we should be concerned not only with the CD axis, which was the focus of attention in his day, but also with the AB axis because, he says, language is \\"a system of pure values which are determined by nothing except the momentary arrangements of its terms\\". To illustrate this, Saussure uses a chess metaphor. We could study the game diachronically (how the rules change through time) or synchronically (the actual rules). Saussure notes that a person joining the audience of a game already in progress requires no more information than the present layout of pieces on the board and who the next player is. There would be no additional benefit in knowing how the pieces had come to be arranged in this way. Geographic linguistics A portion of Course in General Linguistics comprises Saussure's ideas regarding the geographical branch of linguistics.This section of the article references the Roy Harris translation of the book. According to Saussure, the geographic study of languages deals with external, not internal, linguistics. Geographical linguistics, Saussure explains, deals primarily with the study of linguistic diversity across lands, of which there are two kinds: diversity of relationship, which applies to languages assumed to be related; and absolute diversity, in which case there exists no demonstrable relationship between compared languages. Each type of diversity constitutes a unique problem, and each can be approached in a number of ways. For example, the study of Indo- European languages and Chinese (which are not related) benefits from comparison, of which the aim is to elucidate certain constant factors which underlie the establishment and development of any language. The other kind of variation, diversity of relationship, represents infinite possibilities for comparisons, through which it becomes clear that dialects and languages differ only in gradient terms. Of the two forms of diversity, Saussure considers diversity of relationship to be the more useful with regard to determining the essential cause of geographical diversity. While the ideal form of geographical diversity would, according to Saussure, be the direct correspondence of different languages to different areas, the asserted reality is that secondary factors must be considered in tandem with the geographical separation of different cultures. For Saussure, time is the primary catalyst of linguistic diversity, not distance. To illustrate his argument, Saussure considers a hypothetical population of colonists, who move from one island to another. Initially, there is no difference between the language spoken by the colonists on the new island and their homeland counterparts, in spite of the obvious geographical disconnect. Saussure thereby establishes that the study of geographical diversity is necessarily concentrated upon the effects of time on linguistic development. Taking a monoglot community as his model (that is, a community which speaks only one language), Saussure outlines the manner in which a language might develop and gradually undergo subdivision into distinct dialects. Saussure's model of differentiation has 2 basic principles: (1) that linguistic evolution occurs through successive changes made to specific linguistic elements; and (2) that these changes each belong to a specific area, which they affect either wholly or partially. It then follows from these principles that dialects have no natural boundary, since at any geographical point a particular language is undergoing some change. At best, they are defined by \\"waves of innovation\\"‚Äîin other words, areas where some set of innovations converge and overlap. The \\"wave\\" concept is integral to Saussure's model of geographical linguistics‚Äîit describes the gradient manner in which dialects develop. Linguistic waves, according to Saussure, are influenced by two opposed forces: parochialism, which is the basic tendency of a population to preserve its language's traditions; and intercourse, in which communication between people of different areas necessitates the need for cross-language compromise and standardization. Intercourse can prevent dialectical fragmentation by suppressing linguistic innovations; it can also propagate innovations throughout an area encompassing different populations. Either way, the ultimate effect of intercourse is unification of languages. Saussure remarks that there is no barrier to intercourse where only gradual linguistic transitions occur. Having outlined this monoglot model of linguistic diversity, which illustrates that languages in any one area are undergoing perpetual and nonuniform variation, Saussure turns to languages developing in two separate areas. In the case of segregated development, Saussure draws a distinction between cases of contact and cases of isolation. In the latter, commonalities may initially exist, but any new features developed will not be propagated between the two languages. Nevertheless, differentiation will continue in each area, leading to the formation of distinct linguistic branches within a particular family. The relations characterizing languages in contact are in stark contrast to the relations of languages in isolation. Here, commonalities and differences continually propagate to one another‚Äîthus, even those languages that are not part of the same family will manage to develop common features.

exterior Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot - New Wing, Synagogue Hall Museum logo Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot - Let There Be Laughter: Jewish Humor Around the World exhibition The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot is located in Tel Aviv, Israel, at the center of the Tel Aviv University campus in Ramat Aviv. The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot is a global institution that tells the ongoing story of the Jewish people, intended for people of all faiths. Through its educational programming, the institution works to connect Jewish people to their roots and strengthen their personal and collective Jewish identity. The museum presents a pluralistic narrative of Jewish culture, faith, purpose and deed as seen through the lens of Jewish history and current experience today. Formerly the Nahum Goldmann Museum of the Jewish Diaspora (, \\"The Diaspora House\\"), the museum launched a large-scale renewal in 2016, adding a new wing with rotating temporary exhibitions, the Alfred H. Moses and Family Synagogue Hall featuring synagogue scale models, and Heroes - Trailblazers of the Jewish People, a children's interactive exhibition. Museum renovations will culminate with the opening of a new permanent core exhibition in early 2020. It is a center for Jewish discourse, engagement, education and research, encompassing a pluralistic and comprehensive worldview.  History  In 1959, the World Jewish Congress decided to build a museum that would serve both as an educational and cultural center for world Jewry. The institute in Israel was named in honor of Dr. Nahum Goldmann, founder and president of the World Jewish Congress. Abba Kovner, one of the founders of Beit Hatfutsot, proposed the original concept of the museum's permanent core exhibition. It was based on a thematic principle, representing Jewish history and continuity, according to six themes, or \\"gates\\" that portray central aspects of Jewish life: family, community, faith, culture, existence and return. Among the founders of the museum, Jeshajahu Weinberg served as the museum's first director from 1978 to 1984 and Dr. Meyer Weisgal was its first President. Beit Hatfutsot opened on May 15, 1978. From the start, it was regarded as one of the most technologically advanced museums of its time. Its exhibitions were based on reconstructions and sets, using modern audiovisual and state-of-the-art computer technology to explore topics and themes throughout the museum. This methodology provided that a museum could be an effective storyteller. Its designers broke with the universally accepted tradition that museums exist first in order to acquire, care for and display objects from the past. Government budget cuts and a decline in Israeli tourism triggered a budget crisis at the museum. A number of public representatives devoted themselves to saving the museum, among them Shlomo Lahat, former mayor of Tel Aviv, and Ariel Sharon, former prime minister. In 2005, the Israeli Knesset passed the \\"Beit Hatfutsot Law\\" that defines Beit Hatfutsot as \\"the National Center for Jewish Communities in Israel and around the world\\". A recovery plan was enacted with two partners: the Israeli Government and donor Leonid Nevzlin (NADAV Foundation), with a grant from the Claims Conference.  Exhibitions, programs, education and research  The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot allows visitors to learn more about the Jewish experience through a number of access points. Onsite, the museum offers a permanent exhibition, children's gallery, rotating schedule of temporary exhibitions and related programs, conferences and workshops. The museum's databases house searchable archives of photos, films, music, genealogy (family trees) and family names, all related to the Jews and Jewish history. Compiled over almost four decades, these databases are now fully digitized and available both onsite and online. The museum also offers formal and informal educational activities for teachers and students, at the museum and/or for use in classrooms around the world.  Exhibitions  The thematic center of the Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot is its exhibitions; the permanent core exhibition and the new wing which includes five galleries. The two permanent installations in the new wing include The Alfred H. Moses and Family Synagogue Hall and the Heroes children's gallery. There are also three temporary, rotating exhibition galleries in the new wing. The exhibitions all focus on issues of Jewish identity and pluralism. = The Alfred H. Moses and Family Synagogue Hall (permanent) = The Synagogue Hall features the exhibition Hallelujah! Assemble, Pray, Study ‚Äì Synagogues Past and Present. This exhibition presents 21 scale synaogue models representing various communities and Jewish ritual relating to the synagogue: social gatherings, study, creativity and prayer, as well as weddings, Bar/Bat Mitzvahs, fundraising, charity, etc. Alongside each model is an original ritual artifact, either from the synagogue or its respective community. = Heroes ‚Äì Trailblazers of the Jewish People (permanent) = This is an interactive exhibition experience designed for children ages 6‚Äì12 and their families. Visitors will meet different types of Jewish heroes from throughout history including scientists, intellectuals, leaders, revolutionaries, cultural figures, athletes and more ‚Äì men and women with unique talents. = Let There Be Laughter ‚Äì Jewish Humor Around the World (temporary) = This exhibition looks at the origins of Jewish humor and the contributions of Jews to the rise of this global industry.  Workshops and lectures  Programming for the general public includes programs related to the exhibitions and also lectures featuring specialists in Jewish history and culture, workshops, film screenings and more.  Education  The Koret International School for Jewish Peoplehood Studies (ISJPS) develops the discipline of Jewish Peoplehood studies and disseminates formal educational curricula and teaching guides for use in Israel and abroad. The school also creates workshops geared towards educational groups visiting Israel on short and long-term programs.  Open databases  The Oster Visual Documentation Center houses collections of ~500,000 photos of Jewish life, as well as over 1,000 films. This collection includes rare documentary films and amateur video footage dating back to the 1920s, as well as contemporary films produced in Israel and abroad. The Douglas E. Goldman Jewish Genealogy Center contains thousands of Jewish family trees with more than 5,000,000 individuals currently registered. This database enables users to trace family roots and build family trees for future generations. The Feher Jewish Music Center is a collection of thousands of recordings of Jewish music from various communities including traditional songs, prayers, complete albums and information about Jewish musicians, composers and poets. The Memi De-Shalit Database of Jewish Family Names is a database containing over 20,000 short interpretations of Jewish family names including their linguistic origin, history and derivations. The Jewish Communities Database contains history, demography and geography of thousands of Jewish communities worldwide. Personalities is a database containing thousands of biographies of renowned and noteworthy Jewish individuals.  Governance  Irina Nevzlin serves as the current Chair of the Board of Directors and is the President of the NADAV Foundation. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman (Honorary Chair), Ambassador Alfred H. Moses (Co-Chair) and Major- General (Ret.) Eitan Ben Eliyahu (Co-Chair) serve on the Board of Governors. See also *Tourism in Israel References External links \\"Tracing History in Israel\\".

It is the capital of the district of Holzminden. It is located on the river Weser, which at this point forms the border with the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. History Holzminden is first mentioned in the 9th century as Holtesmeni. However, the name did not at this time refer to the present city, but to the village of Altendorf, the \\"old village\\", which was incorporated into the city in 1922. During the reign of Louis the Pious (814‚Äì840), monks from the Abbey of Corbie in France came to this part of Germany and founded a daughter house at Hethis in the Solling. As it became clear that this site was unviable (owing to lack of access to water) it was abandoned, and a new monastery, Corbeia nova (Corvey Abbey), opened close to the river. Old documents show that many pious donations were given to the Holtesmeni (monastery). The settlement is believed to have come into being, along with other settlements in the vicinity, in the 6th-7th centuries. Other villages were subsequently abandoned as Holzminden was granted municipal liberties, allowing greater privileges to its inhabitants, and attracting new settlers from the surrounding hinterland. In 1200 the town was brought under the protection of the prince‚Äôs castle of Everstein, and by 1245 it had received a charter. This was granted by the count of Everstein. The town's coat of arms shows the Everstein lion rampant within the open town gate. From 1408 the town belonged to the Welfen princes; and from the 16th century to the princes of Brunswick of the Wolfenb√ºttel line. From the 16th century until 1942, Holzminden therefore lay within Brunswick-L√ºneburg. In 1640, during the Thirty Years' War, the town was destroyed by the Imperial troops, a blow from which it only slowly recovered. Until the 20th century Holzminden remained a provincial town of small farmers and holdings. During World War I, Holzminden was the site of a large civilian internment camp on the outskirts of the town, which held up to 10,000 Polish, Russian, Belgian and French nationals, including women and children (1914‚Äì18); and also of a smaller prisoner-of-war camp for captured British and British Empire officers (1917‚Äì18). Economy Holzminden: the \\"Weser-quay\\" and the big granary The ‚Ä≥F√ºrstenberger Street‚Ä≥ with view to the ‚Ä≥Haarmann Square (Haarmannplatz)‚Ä≥, named after the district building master Friedrich Ludwig Haarmann, right the Hochschule f√ºr angewandte Wissenschaft und Kunst (HAWK) Train Station Crafts and farming have long ceased to be the main town's sources of income. Holzminden is now a largely industrial town. In the late 19th century, Dr Wilhelm Haarmann began developing the scent and flavours industry. In 1874, with Ferdinand Tiemann, he succeeded in synthesising vanillin from coniferyl alcohol. More products were subsequently developed. The modern successor of their enterprise is the Symrise factory: Holzminden is a centre of the flavour and fragrance ingredient industry, its products being used throughout the world in cosmetic and food manufacture. The large Stiebel Eltron company, which produces heating and hot water products, has its headquarters in Holzminden. Owens-Illinois operates a glassworks in the town. Religion As a part of the former territory of Brunswick, Holzminden maintains a Protestant tradition. The church of St. Pauls in Altendorf, dating from before 1200, is the oldest of the town's churches. In its unadorned simplicity it offers a serene place for rest and contemplation. Other churches in the town are named after Luther, St. Michael, St. Thomas and St. Joseph. Sights The old part of the town and the river Weser The Tilly House of 1609 is located on the Johannis Square. It has a fine Renaissance door, which survived the fires of the Thirty Years' War. Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, commander of the Imperial forces, is said to have spent a night here. The Reichspr√§sidentenhaus links the old part of the town with the Hafendamm and was opened in 1929. The beautiful Glockenspiel (carillon) is very popular, and plays well known tunes at set times. The steeple of the Lutheran church has become a symbol of Holzminden. The interior was remodelled in 1577, when it was made into a two-room church. The Severinsche Haus is a richly decorated house dating from 1683. It is the largest of the bourgeois houses, is decorated with a distinctive weathercock, and is known for its slanting floors. There is a good viewing platform on the Emperor William Tower, south of the town.

The village lies north of the Drammenselva, approximately 6 miles west of Drammen. It is part of the Nedre Eiker municipality and has about 5500 inhabitants. Annually Solbergelva hosts Solbergfestivalen, its own festival at the end of May. Solberg SK is one of the leading bandy teams in Norway. The history of Solbergelva is closely linked to the company Solberg Spinderi, which for many years employed a substantial part of the local workforce. Solberg Spinderi was founded in 1818 under the name Drammens Bomuldsspinneri. The enterprise was founded by Hovel Helseth and three other Drammen merchants who were supporters of the lay preacher Hans Nielsen Hauge.

Similarity and contagion James George Frazer coined the term \\"sympathetic magic\\" in The Golden Bough (1889); Richard Andree, however, anticipated Frazer, writing of sympathy-enchantment () in his 1878 Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche. Frazer subcategorised sympathetic magic into two varieties: that relying on similarity, and that relying on contact or \\"contagion\\": Imitation Imitation involves using effigies, fetishes or poppets to affect the environment of people, or occasionally people themselves. Voodoo dolls (Poppets) are an example of fetishes used in this way. Such as using a lock of hair on the doll creating a \\"link\\" known as a \\"taglock\\" between the doll and the person the hair came from so whatever happens to the doll will also happen on the person. Correspondence Correspondence is based on the idea that one can influence something based on its relationship or resemblance to another thing. Many popular beliefs regarding properties of plants, fruits and vegetables have evolved in the folk-medicine of different societies owing to sympathetic magic. This include beliefs that certain herbs with yellow sap can cure jaundice, that walnuts could strengthen the brain because of the nuts' resemblance to brain, that red beet-juice is good for the blood, that phallic- shaped roots will cure male impotence, etc. Many traditional societies believed that an effect on one object can cause an analogous effect on another object, without an apparent causal link between the two objects. For instance, many folktales feature a villain whose \\"life\\" exists in another object, and who can only be killed if that other object is destroyed, as in the Russian folktale of Koschei the Deathless. (For literary versions, see Sauron's ring in The Lord of the Rings and horcruxes in the Harry Potter books; the Dungeons & Dragons term lich has become common in recent fantasy literature.) Mircea Eliade wrote that in Uganda, a barren woman is thought to cause a barren garden, and her husband can seek a divorce on purely economic grounds. Many societies have been documented as believing that, instead of requiring an image of an individual, influence can be exerted using something that they have touched or used. Consequently, the inhabitants of Tanna, Vanuatu in the 1970s were cautious when throwing away food or losing a fingernail, as they believed these small scraps of personal items could be used to cast a spell causing fevers. Similarly, an 18th-century compendium of Russian folk magic describes how someone could be influenced through sprinkling cursed salt on a path frequently used by the victim, while a 15th-century crown princess of Joseon Korea is recorded as having cut her husband's lovers' shoes into pieces and burnt them. Hypotheses about prehistoric sympathetic magic Sympathetic magic has been considered in relation to Paleolithic cave paintings such as those in North Africa and at Lascaux in France. The theory, which is partially based on studies of more modern hunter-gatherer societies, is that the paintings were made by magic practitioners who could potentially be described as shamans. The shamans would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a trance state and then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing power out of the cave walls themselves. This goes some way towards explaining the remoteness of some of the paintings (which often occur in deep or small caves) and the variety of subject matter (from prey animals to predators and human hand-prints). In his book Primitive Mythology, Joseph Campbell stated that the paintings \\"...were associated with the magic of the hunt.\\" For him, this sympathetic magic was akin to a participation mystique, where the paintings, drawn in a sanctuary of \\"timeless principle\\", were acted upon by rite. In 1933, Leo Frobenius, discussing cave paintings in North Africa, pointed out that many of the paintings did not seem to be mere depictions of animals and people. To him, it seemed as if they were acting out a hunt before it began, perhaps as a consecration of the animal to be killed. In this way, the pictures served to secure a successful hunt. While others interpreted the cave images as depictions of hunting accidents or of ceremonies, Frobenius believed it was much more likely that \\"...what was undertaken [in the paintings] was a consecration of the animal effected not through any real confrontation of man and beast but by a depiction of a concept of the mind.\\" In 2005, Francis Thackeray published a paper in the journal Antiquity, in which he recognised that there was a strong case for the principle of sympathetic magic in southern Africa in prehistory. For example, a rock engraving from Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa (dated at 4000 years before the present, BP) showed a zebra which had probably been \\"symbolically wounded\\", with incisions on the rump being associated with wounds. Ochre on the engraved slab could represent blood. A prehistoric rock painting at Melikane in Lesotho shows what appear to be men (shamans) bending forward like animals, with two sticks to represent the front legs of an antelope. Thackeray suggests that these men, perhaps shamans or \\"medicine-men\\" dressed under animal skins, were associated with hunting rituals of the kind recorded by H. Lichtenstein in 1812 in South Africa, in which a hunter simulated an antelope which was symbolically killed by other hunters, in the belief that this was essential for a successful hunt. Such rituals could be represented in prehistoric art such as paintings at Melikane in Lesotho. Thackeray suggests that the Melikane therianthropes are associated with both trance and the principle of sympathetic hunting magic In 2005, in the journal Antiquity, Francis Thackeray suggests that there is even a photograph of such rituals, recorded in 1934 at Logageng in the southern Kalahari, South Africa. Such rituals may have been closely associated with both roan antelope and eland, and other animals. In the Brandberg in Namibia, in the so-called \\"White Lady\\" panel recorded by the Abbe Henri Breuil and Harald Pager, there are \\"symbolic wounds\\" on the belly of a gemsbok-like therianthrope (catalogued as T1), which might relate to the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and trance, as suggested by Thackeray in 2013. At the Apollo 11 cave in Namibia, Erich Wendt discovered mobile art about 30,000 years old, including a stone broken in two pieces, with a gemsbok-like therianthrope that closely resembles the Brandberg therianthrope which Thackeray catalogues as T1. Both examples of art may be related to sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism. In 2013 Thackeray emphasised that in southern Africa, the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism (trance) were not mutually exclusive. However, as with all prehistory, it is impossible to be certain due to the limited evidence and the many pitfalls associated with trying to understand the prehistoric mindset with a modern mind. Popular culture The concept of sympathetic magic features prominently in the Kingkiller Chronicle novel series by Patrick Rothfuss. Merricat Blackwood in Shirley Jackson's We Have Always Lived in the Castle is a practitioner of sympathetic magic. In Rick Riordan's The Kane Chronicles, sympathetic magic is practiced prominently. The music duo Charming Disaster has a song called \\"Sympathetic Magic\\". A duet between the magic user and her target. Catspaw (Star Trek: The Original Series):\\"Sympathetic magic\\" is referred to, and is the basis for this episode.

He is sometimes given the sobriquet \\"Father of Aviation Medicine\\". Life Bert was born at Auxerre (Yonne). He studied law, earning a doctorate in Paris; then, under the influence of the zoologist Louis Pierre Gratiolet (1815‚Äì1865), he took up physiology, becoming one of Claude Bernard's most brilliant students. After graduating at Paris as doctor of medicine in 1863, and doctor of science in 1866, he was appointed professor of physiology successively at Bordeaux (1866) and the Sorbonne (1869). After the \\"Commune de Paris\\" (1870) he began to take part in politics as a supporter of Gambetta. In 1874 he was elected to the Assembly, where he sat on the extreme left, and in 1876 to the chamber of deputies. He was one of the most determined enemies of clericalism, and an ardent advocate of \\"liberating national education from religious sects, while rendering it accessible to every citizen.\\" From 14 November 1881 to 30 January 1882 he was minister of education and worship in Gambetta's short-lived cabinet, and in 1881 he created a great sensation by a lecture on modern Catholicism, delivered in a Paris theatre, in which he poured ridicule on the fables and follies of the chief religious tracts and handbooks that circulated especially in the south of France. Bert was unexpectedly named resident general of the French Republic in Annam and Tonkin on 31 January 1886. He left France in February 1886 accompanied by a dozen people including Antony Klobukowski, former chief of staff of Charles Thomson, and Charles Fran√ßois Laurent, inspector of finances. Bert died of dysentery at Hanoi on 11 November 1886. After Bert's death Klobukowski and Laurent were listed among the subscribers in Tonkin to a fund to erect a statue in Bert's honour. Works He was more distinguished as a man of science than as a politician or administrator. His classical work, La Pression barometrique (1878), embodies researches that gained him the biennial prize of 20,000 francs from the Academy of Sciences in 1875, and is a comprehensive investigation on the physiological effects of air-pressure, both above and below the normal. Translated by: Hitchcock, Mary Alice; Hitchcock, Fred A. Central nervous system oxygen toxicity was first described in this publication and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Paul Bert effect\\". He showed that oxygen was toxic to insects, arachnids, myriapods, molluscs, earthworms, fungi, germinating seeds, birds, and other animals. He also received the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh for this work. His earliest researches, which provided him with material for his two doctoral theses, were devoted to animal grafting and the vitality of animal tissues, and they were followed by studies on the physiological action of various poisons, on anaesthetics, on respiration and asphyxia, on the causes of the change of color in the chameleon, etc. He was also interested in vegetable physiology, and in particular investigated the movements of the sensitive plant, and the influence of light of different colours on the life of vegetation. He wrote a very successful textbook with Raphael Blanchard √âl√©ments de zoologie G. Masson (Paris), 1885. In The Phrenological journal and science of health (1883) it was claimed that he held an atheistic belief\\"Dr. Paul Bert, the atheist Minister of Public Instruction, in M. Gambetta's Cabinet, made the next greatest sensation of the Congress.\\" The Phrenological journal and science of health: incorporated with the Phrenological magazine, Volume 76, Fowler & Wells (1883), page 42. Racist theories After about 1880, he produced several elementary textbooks of scientific instruction and also various publications on educational and allied subjects.

Life He was born at Carlisle, Cumberland on 13 August 1826, and was the son of William Best, a solicitor of that city.Henry Charles Lahee (1903) The Organ and Its Masters, L. C. Page, Boston In childhood, he displayed talent for music, and had some lessons from Young, organist of Carlisle Cathedral. As his father intended he should become a civil engineer, he was sent to Liverpool in 1840 for study. At the age of fourteen, he became organist of the baptist chapel in Pembroke Road, which contained an organ with C C pedal-keyboard, then very rare in England. He practised four hours daily on this organ, and also worked regularly at pianoforte technique. In the main, Best was self-taught; the organists of that period were nearly all accustomed only to the incomplete F or G organs, upon which the works of Bach and Mendelssohn could not be played, and he applied himself to Bach's music in particular. He had some lessons in counterpoint from John Richardson, organist of St. Nicholas's Roman Catholic church; and also, it appears, from a blind organist. At about the age of twenty, he decided to become a professional musician. In 1847 he was appointed organist at the Church for the Blind in Liverpool, and in 1849 also to the Liverpool Philharmonic Society under whose auspices he made his first appearance as a concert organist. He paid a visit to Spain in the winter of 1852‚Äì3, and then spent some time in London, acting as organist at the Royal Panopticon, which possessed a four-manual organ, the largest in London. He was dismissed for refusing to play Mendelssohn's Wedding March while the audience was exiting the auditorium. He was also for a few months organist at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields and at Lincoln's Inn Chapel. In 1855, on the completion of the great organ in St. George's Hall, Liverpool, he was appointed corporation organist at a salary of ¬£300 yearly, and conducted a grand concert as the climax of the festivities at the opening of the hall. He remained organist of St. George's Hall nearly forty years, and gave three recitals weekly. His performances rapidly became famous throughout England; ill health forced him to retire in 1894. For some years he was much occupied in Liverpool as a teacher, and also became church organist at Wallasey in 1860. After three years he left this post and acted for some time as organist at Trinity Church, Walton Breck; and, finally, he was organist at West Derby parish church. In 1859, he occasionally played organ solos at the Monday Popular Concerts in St. James's Hall, London. Although complete pedal- keyboards had now become general, no performer in England equalled Best, and he was very frequently invited to inaugurate newly built organs all over the country. At the Handel festival in June 1871, Best played an organ concerto with orchestral accompaniment, probably the first occasion within living memory when any of these works was played as was intended by the composer; and the experiment was so successful that Best was engaged at subsequent festivals for the same purpose. He also inaugurated the huge organ in the Royal Albert Hall on 18 July 1871. In 1880, he was offered a knighthood; but he preferred to take a civil list pension of ¬£100. He also refused to be made doctor of music. Continual work as a performer, composer, editor, and teacher, brought on an illness which necessitated a lengthened rest in 1881‚Äì2; he visited Italy, and during his convalescence gave a grand recital in Rome, at the request of Liszt. On his return to England he discontinued teaching, and resigned his appointment at West Derby church. As the greatest living British organist he was invited to Australia to inaugurate the organ in the town hall at Sydney, which contains a pipe sixty-four feet in length. He accepted the invitation, and before leaving England exhibited the powers of this unrivalled instrument at the builder's factory in London, in the presence of a number of Australians. He gave a farewell recital in St. George's Hall on 8 February 1890, and gave the inaugural performance at Sydney on 9 August. He had suffered from gout, and expected the journey would improve his health; but it had a contrary effect, and after his return his public appearances were less frequent. He retired in February 1894 with a pension of ¬£240. After much suffering from dropsy, he died at his residence, Seymour Road, Broad Green, Liverpool, on 10 May 1897, and was buried on 13 May in Childwall parish graveyard. Works He published some pianoforte and vocal pieces, which had little success ; his organ compositions are much more important, and are constantly played at recitals in churches and concert-rooms. His ecclesiastical music, especially his Benedicite (1864) with a free organ part, and his Service in F, may often be heard in cathedrals and parish churches. He was still better known as an editor, and was remarkably painstaking and conscientious (Musical Herald, October 1900, p. 293). He was deeply studied in Handel's music, and edited his concertos and large selections of airs from the operas and oratorios. A Handel-Album, which extended to twenty volumes, was originally intended to consist of selections from the lesser-known instrumental works arranged for the organ; it was afterwards taken from more varied sources‚Äîthe operas especially. He arranged for organ some hundreds of excerpts from other great masters' vocal and instrumental works. Another of Best's editions was Cecilia (1883), a collection, in fifty-six parts, of original organ pieces by modern composers of various countries; it included his own Sonata in D minor, a Christmas Pastorale, a set of Twelve Preludes on English Psalm-tunes, a Concert-fugue, a Scherzo, and several other pieces of his own composition. The Art of Organ-Playing (1869) is a very complete and thoroughly practical instruction book, ranging from the rudiments of execution to the highest proficiency. At the bicentenary of Bach's birth in 1885, Best began an edition of Bach's organ works, which he almost completed before he died. Assessment As an executant Best was admittedly the first among contemporary British organists. All that can be done upon the organ he did to perfection, and by his crisp playing he suggested the accent which is, strictly speaking, not within the powers of the instrument. His repertory was commonly supposed to include five thousand pieces, and he was remarkably successful in using the organ as a substitute for the orchestra. In addition he was a very brilliant pianist. Best was somewhat eccentric and in the main a recluse. He associated little with other musicians. He would not join the Royal College of Organists, and refused to play on any organ whose pedal- keyboard had been constructed on the plan recommended by that college. For many years he refused to let any other organist play on his own organ. He kept the tuner in attendance at his recitals in St. George's Hall, and would leave his seat in the middle of a performance to expostulate with him; on one occasion he informed the audience that the tuner received a princely salary and neglected his work. He would indulge his fancies to the full in brilliant extemporisations when a church organist, but his recitals in St. George's Hall were invariably restrained and classical.

Retrieved 15 Oct. 2011. distinguished by the absence of a cell wall. The word \\"Mollicutes\\" is derived from the Latin mollis (meaning \\"soft\\" or \\"pliable\\"), and cutis (meaning \\"skin\\"). Individuals are very small, typically only 0.2‚Äì0.3 Œºm (200-300 nm) in size and have a very small genome size. They vary in form, although most have sterols that make the cell membrane somewhat more rigid. Many are able to move about through gliding, but members of the genus Spiroplasma are helical and move by twisting. The best-known genus in the Mollicutes is Mycoplasma. Mollicutes are parasites of various animals and plants, living on or in the host's cells. Many cause diseases in humans, attaching to cells in the respiratory or urogenital tracts, particularly species of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma. Phytoplasma and Spiroplasma are plant pathogens associated with insect vectors. Whereas formerly the trivial name \\"mycoplasma\\" has commonly denoted any member of the class Mollicutes, it now refers exclusively to a member of the genus Mycoplasma. Origin and development to parasitic life Analysis of the genomes of mycoplasmas gives solid support for the hypothesis that mycoplasmas have developed from Gram- positive bacteria by a process of reductive evolution. By adopting a parasitic mode of life with use of nutrients from their hosts, mycoplasmas were able to reduce their genetic material considerably. On the other hand, mycoplasma lost the genes for many assimilative processes. Thus, Mycoplasma possibly became the smallest self-replicating organism in nature. Mycoplasma genitalium, with 580,000 base pairs, has an especially small genome size. Some phytoplasmas also have a very small genome size. The genera with the smallest genome are considered to be phylogenetically the most \\"recent\\" mollicutes. To maintain their parasitic mode of life the mollicutes have developed rather sophisticated mechanisms to colonize their hosts and resist the host immune system.Shmuel Razin, David Yogev and Yehudith Naot Molecular Biology and Pathogenicity of Mycoplasmas. Micr. and Molec. Biology Reviews, December 1998, pp. 1094‚Äì1156, Vol. 62, No. 4 History of the classification The classification of the Mollicutes has always been difficult. The individuals are tiny, and being parasites, they have to be cultivated on special media. Until now, many species could not be isolated at all. In the beginning, whether they were fungi, viruses, or bacteria was not clear. Also, the resemblance to L-forms was confusing. At first, all members of the class Mollicutes were generally named \\"mycoplasma\\" or pleuropneumonia-like organism (PPLO). Mollicutes other than some members of genus Mycoplasma were still unidentified. The first species of Mycoplasma/Mollicutes, that could be isolated was Mycoplasma mycoides. This bacterium was cultivated by Nocard and Roux in 1898. In 1956, D.G. Edward and E.A. Freundt made a first proposal for classifying and naming PPLOs. They left undecided, however, whether they belong to the bacteria (prokaryotes, in 1956 called \\"Schizomycetes\\") or to the eukaryotes. As type species (name-giving species) of the PPLOs/mycoplasmas, Edward and Freundt proposed Mycoplasma mycoides, being the causative organism of bovine pleuropneumonia and referring to the pleuropneumonia-like organisms. Until then, Mycoplasma mycoides was known as Asterococcus mycoides, but later that name was not recognized as valid. In their publication of 1956, they described 15 species of Mycoplasma.pdf In 1967 the class Mollicutes, containing the order Mycoplasmatales, was proposed by the Subcommittee on Taxonomy of the Mycoplasmata. Now, the name Mycoplasma should exclusively be used for members of the genus Mycoplasma, rather than the use as a trivial name for any mollicute. As the trivial name has been used in literature for a long time, this is yet not always the case. Three divisions of the kingdom \\"Procaryotae\\" Traditionally, the taxonomy of bacteria was based on similarities and differences in morphology (Linnaean taxonomy). In 1962, R.G.E. Murray proposed to divide the kingdom Bacteria into three divisions (= phyla) on the basis of the cell wall types: # Gram-negative Gracilicutes, with a thin cell wall and little peptidoglycan; # Gram-positive \\"Firmacutes\\", with a thicker cell wall and more peptidoglycan (the name was later changed in \\"Firmicutes\\"), and # the \\"Mollicutes\\", without a cell wall.N.E.

Some taxonomists place them in Firmicutes, others in Tenericutes. Woese et al. suggested that the Mollicutes might have been derived from different branches of bacteria. They concluded, that the Mollicutes are not a phylogenetically coherent group and therefore do not form a distinct higher level taxon. Instead, they cluster within Gram-positive bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes.C.R. Woese, J. Maniloff and L.B. Zablen Phylogenetic analysis of the mycoplasmas Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The citadel that stands today dates to the Mamluk and Ottoman periods. It was built on the site of a series of earlier ancient fortifications of the Hasmonean, Herodian, Byzantine and Early Muslim periods, after being destroyed repeatedly during the last decades of Crusader presence in the Holy Land by their Muslim enemies. It contains important archaeological finds dating back over 2,500 years including a quarry dated to the First Temple period, and is a popular venue for benefit events, craft shows, concerts, and sound-and-light performances. Dan Bahat writes that the original three Hasmonean towers standing in this area of the city were altered by Herod, and that \\"The northeastern tower was replaced by a much larger, more massive tower, dubbed the \\"Tower of David\\" beginning in the 5th century C.E.\\" The name \\"Tower of David\\" migrated in the 19th century from the Herodian tower in the northeast of the citadel, to the 17th-century minaret at the opposite side of the citadel, and after 1967 has been officially adopted for the entire citadel. Names=\\"Tower of David\\": Herodian tower The name \\"Tower of David\\" was first used for the Herodian tower in the 5th century CE by the Byzantine Christians, who believed the site to be the palace of King David. They borrowed the name \\"Tower of David\\" from the Song of Songs, attributed to Solomon, King David's son, who wrote: \\"Thy neck is like the Tower of David built with turrets, whereon there hang a thousand shields, all the armor of the mighty men\\" (). Other names Another name of the massive Herodian- Mamluk northeast tower is the . During the Early Muslim and Ayyubid periods it was known in Arabic as Mihrab Dawud, lit. 'David's prayer place/upper room'. History View of Tower of David from above Palace of Herod the Great with the three towers (Phasael, Hippicus, Mariamne from left to right) Hasmonean period During the 2nd century BCE, the Old City of Jerusalem expanded further onto the so-called Western Hill. This 773-meter-high prominence, which comprises the modern Armenian and Jewish Quarters as well as Mount Zion, was bounded by steep valleys on all sides except for the northern one. The first settlement in this area was about 150 BCE around the time of the Hasmonean kings when what Josephus Flavius named the First Wall was constructed. Herod's towers Large Herodian ashlars topped by smaller Mamluk stones Herod, who wrestled the power away from the Hasmonean dynasty, added three massive towers to the fortifications in 37‚Äì34 BCE. He built these at the vulnerable northwest corner of the Western Hill, where the Citadel is now located. His purpose was not only to defend the city, but to safeguard his own royal palace located nearby on Mount Zion. Herod named the tallest of the towers, in height, the Phasael in memory of his brother who had committed suicide while in captivity. Another tower was called the Mariamne, named for his second wife whom he had executed and buried in a cave to the west of the tower. He named the third tower the Hippicus after one of his friends. Of the three towers, only the base of one of them survives until today‚Äîeither the Phasael or, as argued by archaeologist Hillel Geva who excavated the Citadel, the Hippicus Tower. Archaeologist H. Geva proposes that the \\"Tower of David\\", be identified with Josephus's Hippicus tower. Hillel Geva (Ph.D.) has excavated the Citadel, is Director of the Israel Exploration Society and currently edits and publishes the reports for the Jewish Quarter Excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem. The identification with the Hippicus tower was already proposed by 19th-century biblical scholar Robinson, opposed by other 19th-early 20th century scholars, such as J. Fergusson, Thomas Lewin, Conrad Schick, G.A. Smith, C. Warren and C.R. Conder, who held that the \\"Tower of David\\" should be identified with the tower of Phasael, based on its size. Of the original tower itself (now called the Tower of David), some sixteen courses of the Herodian stone ashlars are still rising from ground level (partially hidden by a much later built glacis), upon which were added smaller stones in a later period, which added back significantly to the height of the remaining stump of the Herodian tower. During the Jewish war with Rome, Simon bar Giora made the tower his place of residence.Josephus, The Jewish War (V.IV.3; VII.II.1) Following the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE, the three towers were preserved as a testimony of the might of the fortifications overcome by the Roman legions, and the site served as barracks for the Roman troops. When the empire adopted Christianity as its favoured religion in the 4th century, a community of monks established itself in the citadel. It was during the Byzantine period that the remaining Herodian tower, and by extension the Citadel as a whole, acquired its alternative name‚Äîthe Tower of David‚Äîafter the Byzantines, mistakenly identifying the hill as Mount Zion, presumed it to be David's palace mentioned in . Early Muslims, Crusaders, Ayyubids After the Arab conquest of Jerusalem in 638, the new Muslim rulers refurbished the citadel. This powerful structure withstood the assault of the Crusaders in 1099, and surrendered only when its defenders were guaranteed safe passage out of the city. During the Crusader period, thousands of pilgrims undertook the pilgrimage to Jerusalem by way of the port at Jaffa. To protect pilgrims from the menace of highway robbers, the Crusaders built a tower surrounded by a moat atop the citadel, and posted lookouts to guard the road to Jaffa. The citadel also protected the newly erected palace of the Crusader kings of Jerusalem, located immediately south of the citadel. In 1187, Sultan Saladin captured the city including the citadel. In 1239 the Ayyubid emir of Karak, An-Nasir Dawud, attacked the Crusader garrison and destroyed the citadel. In 1244 the Khwarazmians defeated and banished the Crusaders from Jerusalem for a last time, destroying the entire city in the process. The Mamluks destroyed the citadel in 1260. Mamluk and Ottoman citadel In 1310 the citadel was rebuilt by Mamluk sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun, who gave it much of its present shape.The Citadel: Position, EnjoyJerusalem.com (EU-supported Palestinian website) Masjid Mihrab ed-Dawood, the Ottoman \\"David's Prayer Niche Mosque\\", mihrab and minbar The citadel was expanded between 1537 and 1541 by the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, whose architects designed a large entrance, behind which stood a cannon emplacement. For 400 years, the citadel served as a garrison for Turkish troops. The Ottomans also installed a mosque near the southwest corner of the citadel commonly known as the Mihrab el-Qal'a ed-Dawood (\\"Prayer niche of David's fortress\\"), erecting a minaret during the years 1635-1655. In the 19th century the conspicuous minaret, which still stands today, took over the title of \\"Tower of David\\", so that the name can now refer to either the whole Citadel or the minaret alone. At least two mosques are known to exist with in the Jerusalem Citadel. The moat, main gate and tower in 1911 During World War I, British forces under General Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem. General Allenby formally proclaimed the event standing on a platform at the outer eastern gate of the citadel. British and Jordanian periods Main gate to citadel, 1920 During the period of British rule (1917‚Äì1948), the High Commissioner established the Pro-Jerusalem Society to protect the city's cultural heritage. This organisation cleaned and renovated the citadel and reopened it to the public as a venue for concerts, benefit events and exhibitions by local artists. In the 1930s, a museum of Palestinian folklore was opened in the citadel, displaying traditional crafts and clothing.Tower of David: History of a Citadel, at the homepage (2007) of the Tower of David Museum of the History of Jerusalem Following the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Arab Legion captured Jerusalem and converted the citadel back to its historical role as a military position, as it commanded a dominant view across the armistice line into Jewish Jerusalem. It would keep this role until 1967.

Since the Israeli occupation after the Six-Day War in 1967, the citadel's cultural role was revived. The Tower of David Museum of the History of Jerusalem was opened in 1989 by the Jerusalem Foundation. Located in a series of chambers in the original citadel, the museum includes a courtyard which contains archeological remains dating back 2,700 years. The exhibits depict 4,000 years of Jerusalem's history, from its beginnings as a Canaanite city to modern times. Using maps, videotapes, holograms, drawings and models, the exhibit rooms each depict Jerusalem under its various rulers. Visitors may also ascend to the ramparts, which command a 360-degree view of the Old City and New City of Jerusalem. As of 2002, the Jerusalem Foundation reported that over 3.5 million visitors had toured the museum.

It is located on the river Senio. History The city was created in 1250 by count Bernardino of Cunio after a flood which had destroyed his castle at Donigallia. After several passages of property in the hands of local noble families, the castle of Fusignano was transferred to the Este family in 1445. When the Duchy of Ferrara was annexed to the Papal States (1598), the fief was elevated to a marquisate, which in 1622, after a long struggle with the Corelli family, was acquired by the Calcagnini. In the 18th century the city recovered from a dark period, and in 1796 became part of the French dominions. In 1815 it returned to the Roman Church. With the unification of Italy (1860), Fusignano was separated from Ferrara and included in the province of Ravenna. During World War II, as part of the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy, Fusignano was for four months on the front line, and reduced to ruins. Main sights The church of San Giovanni Battista houses a 16th-century pale portraying the Baptism of Christ.

It is a monopoly created by the government. It is usually distinguished from a government-granted monopoly, where the government grants a monopoly to a private individual or company. A government monopoly may be run by any level of government - national, regional, local; for levels below the national, it is a local monopoly. The term state monopoly usually means a government monopoly run by the national government, although it may also refer to monopolies run by private entities yet protected or sanctioned by the state government. Examples The most prominent example of the monopoly is law and the legitimate use of physical force.K. Grechenig, M. Kolmar, The State's Enforcement Monopoly and the Private Protection of Property, Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) 2014, vol. 170 (1), 5-23. In many countries, the postal system is run by the government with competition forbidden by law in some or all services. Also, government monopolies on public utilities, telecommunications and railroads have historically been common, though recent decades have seen a strong privatization trend throughout the industrialized world. In Nordic countries some goods deemed harmful are distributed through a government monopoly. For example, in Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, government-owned companies have monopolies for selling alcoholic beverages. Casinos and other institutions for gambling might also be monopolized. In Finland, the government has a monopoly to operate slot machines. Governments often create or allow monopolies to exist and grant them patents. This limits entry and allow the patent-holding firm to earn a monopoly profit from an invention. Health care systems where the government controls the industry and specifically prohibits competition, such as in Canada, are government monopolies.

Biography Born Hans Gebser in Posen in Imperial Germany (now Poland), he left Germany in 1929, living for a time in Italy and then in France. He then moved to Spain, mastered the Spanish language in a few months and entered the Spanish Civil Service where he rose to become a senior official in the Spanish Ministry of Education.

It was here that he changed his German first name \\"Hans\\" to the French \\"Jean.\\"Gebser BiographyThe Primordial Leap and the Present: The Ever-Present Origin ‚Äì An Overview of the Work of Jean Gebser He lived in Paris for a while but saw the unavoidability of a German invasion. He fled to Switzerland in 1939, escaping only hours before the border was closed. He spent the rest of his life near Bern, where he did most of his writing. Even late in life, Gebser travelled widely in India, the Far East, and the Americas, and wrote half a dozen more books. He was also a published poet. Gebser died in Wabern bei Bern on May 14, 1973 \\"with a soft and knowing smile.\\" His personal letters and publications are held at the Gebser Archives at the University of Oklahoma History of Science Collections, Norman, Oklahoma, Bizzel Libraries. Consciousness in transition Gebser's major thesis was that human consciousness is in transition, and that these transitions are \\"mutations\\" and not continuous. These jumps or transformations involve structural changes in both mind and body. Gebser held that previous consciousness structures continue to operate parallel to the emergent structure. Consciousness is \\"presence\\", or \\"being present\\": Each consciousness structure eventually becomes deficient, and is replaced by a following structure. The stress and chaos in Europe from 1914 to 1945 were the symptoms of a structure of consciousness that was at the end of its effectiveness, and which heralded the birth of a new form of consciousness. The first evidence he witnessed was in the novel use of language and literature. He modified this position in 1943 so as to include the changes which were occurring in the arts and sciences at that time. His thesis of the failure of one structure of consciousness alongside the emergence of a new one led him to inquire as to whether such had not occurred before. His work, Ursprung und Gegenwart is the result of that inquiry. It was published in various editions from 1949 to 1953, and translated into English as The Ever-Present Origin. Working from the historical evidence of almost every major field, (e.g., poetry, music, visual arts, architecture, philosophy, religion, physics and the other natural sciences, etc.) Gebser saw traces of the emergence (which he called \\"efficiency\\") and collapse (\\"deficiency\\") of various structures of consciousness throughout history. The structures of consciousness Gebser distinguished the following structures: # The archaic structure # The magic structure # The mythical structure # The mental structure # The integral structure The archaic structure The archaic structure is the first structure of consciousness to emerge from the \\"ever-present origin\\": No direct information on this structure is available; it is inferred from writings from later times. It is zero-dimensional; consciousness is only \\"a dimly lit mist devoid of shadows\\". It is not individual, but \\"was totally identical with the whole\\": The magic structure In the magical structure events, objects and persons are magically related. Symbols and statues do not just represent those events, objects and persons, but are those same objects and persons. Gebser symbolizes this \\"one-dimensional\\" consciousness structure by the space-less, time-less \\"point\\". Unlike the archaic structure in which there is a \\"perfect identity of man and universe\\",Gebser 1985,1991: p. 45 man is aware of nature as something within his community to which it must \\"listen\\" and out of which it must act in order to survive. The mythical structure Gebser symbolizes the \\"two-dimensional\\" mythical structure by the circle and cyclical time, based on man's discovery of the rhythmic recurrence of natural events and of his inner reflections on his experience of those events. \\"...[W]hereas the distinguishing characteristic of the magic structure was the emergent awareness of nature, the essential characteristic of the mythical structure is the emergent awareness of soul.\\"Gebser 1985,1991: p. 61 In the mythical structure events, objects and persons are woven together in stories. Mythologies give coherence to consciousness. An important element in myth is polarity; the etymology of myth itself implies both speaking (mouth, mythos) and silence (mute, ').Gebser 1985,1991: pp. 64-65 Gebser explains that polarity makes myth particularly foreign to the mental consciousness structure: \\"Only when we acknowledge both meanings of the root can we discern the fundamental nature of the mythical structure. Only when taken together as an elemental ambivalence, and not a rational contradiction, are they constitutive for the mythical structure.\\"Gebser 1985,1991: pp. 65-66 \\"Only a mental world requires laws; the mythical world, secure in the polarity, neither knows nor needs them.\\"Gebser 1985,1991: p. 76 The mental structure The mental structure appropriates events, objects and persons by the use of logic. In its efficient form, the mental structure is \\"three- dimensional\\". Gebser symbolizes it with the \\"triangle\\", which illustrates a \\"trinity\\" of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis: \\"the base of the triangle with its two points lying in opposition represents the dual contraries or antinomies which are unified at the point or apex.\\"Gebser 1985,1991: p. 87 For Gebser, this is the essence of \\"the emergence of directed or discursive thought\\"Gebser 1985,1991: p. 75 with which Western science would be built. \\"It required centuries to sufficiently devitalize and demythologize the word so that it was able to express distinct concepts freed from the wealth of imagery, as well as to reach the rationalistic extreme where the word, once a power [magic] and later an image [myth], was degraded to a mere formula.\\"Gebser 1985,1991: p. 83 The deficient form of the mental structure Gebser called the 'rational' structure. The rational structure of awareness seeks to deny the other structures with its claim that humans are exclusively rational. The rational structure is known for its extremes as evidenced in various \\"nothing but...\\" statements. Extreme materialism claims that \\"everything is nothing but matter ‚Äî atoms\\". Philosophy, the love of wisdom, is replaced with instrumental reason, the ability \\"to make\\". Contemplation‚Äîlooking inward‚Äîis devalued in relation to what one \\"can do\\". \\"Wise men\\" fall out of favor and are replaced by the \\"man of action.\\" Successes in technologically re-shaping matter offer solutions to some problems but also give rise to problems of their own making. Mechanized slaughter of two world wars and the new atomic weapons exemplified and symbolized the expression of the ontology of the rational/mental structure. Living becomes hard to bear in such a consciousness structure. Some saw the cause of this despair as a lack of values or ethics. Gebser saw that it is the very consciousness structure itself which has played out to its inherent end. He saw that its metaphysical presumptions necessarily led to this ethical dead end. A \\"value-free\\" ontology like materialism leads of necessity to living \\"without value\\". Any attempt to remedy the situation by a return to \\"values\\" would ultimately fail. But it was through this very quagmire of \\"the decline of the West\\" that Gebser saw the emergence of a new structure of consciousness which he termed the integral. The integral structure The integral consciousness structure was made evident by a new relationship to space and time. In the second part of his work, Gebser set out to document the evidence that he saw throughout various human endeavors. Of note here were the incorporation of time in physics, the attempts to \\"paint\\" time in the visual arts and the like. Gebser noticed that the integral structure of consciousness was largely witnessed as the irruption of time into the \\"fixed-reality\\" of the mental structure. For Gebser, dualistically opposed and \\"static\\" categories of Being gave way to transparency. Transparency points to how it is that the one is \\"given-through\\" and always \\"along-with\\" the other. For centuries, time was viewed as having distinct categories of past, present and future. These categories were said to be wholly distinct one from the other. Of course, this created all kinds of difficulties regarding how beings moved from one category to the other -- from present to past, for example. What integral awareness notices is that though we may utilize categorical thinking for various purposes, we also have the realization that time is an indivisible whole. That various beings in the present are crystallized from the past, and which also extend into the future. In fact, without already having an integral awareness, one could have no notion of time as \\"past\\" or \\"present\\", etc. Without the awareness of the whole, one would be stuck in a kind of \\"not-knowing\\" of an always only \\"now\\" not connected to any sense of past or future. Even the mental awareness which divides this whole into distinct categories could not have become aware of those categories without an awareness which was already integral. Thus, awareness is already integral. Gebser introduced the notion of presentation which means to make something present through transparency. An aspect of integral awareness is the presentation, or \\"making present\\", of the various structures of awareness. Rather than allowing only one (rational) structure to be valid, all structures are recognized, presented, one through the other. This awareness of and acceptance of the various structures enables one to live through the various structures rather than to be subjected to them (\\"lived by\\" them in German). To realize the various structures within one's language and habits, and even within one's own life and self is a difficult task. But Gebser says that it is a task that we cannot choose to ignore without losing ourselves. This means that our so-called \\"objective thinking\\" is not without consequences, is not innocent. That to live \\"objectively\\" means to give life to the horrors of nihilism combined with the know how of highly \\"efficient\\" weapons. It means that \\"objectivity\\" gets applied to \\"engineering humanity\\" whether it is in the behavioral sciences or the physical sciences. He asks of us whether or not we have had our fill of those horrors yet. Are we willing to settle into the comfort of our daily life or to take on the process of change? He offers as a guiding note that just as there is also a time to act, there is also the much neglected time of contemplation. In a world where know-how is overvalued, simple knowing must also be nurtured. Furthermore, he knew that thought was never simply a mental exercise restricted to one's writing. He calls upon us to realize that we are what we think. Terminology=Discontinuity Gebser cautioned against using terms like evolution, progression, or development to describe the changes in structures of consciousness that he described. Gebser traces the evidence for the transformations of the structure of consciousness as they are concretized in historical artifacts. He sought to avoid calling this process \\"evolutionary\\", since any such notion was illusory when applied to the \\"unfolding of consciousness.\\" Gebser emphasized that biological evolution is an enclosing process which particularizes a species to a limited environment. The unfolding of awareness is, by contrast, an opening-up. Any attempt to give a direction or goal to the unfolding of awareness is illusory in that it is based upon a limited, mentalistic, linear notion of time. Gebser notes that \\"to progress\\" is to move toward something and is thus also to move away from something else; therefore, progress is an inappropriate term to describe the structures of consciousness. Gebser wrote that the question as to the fate of humanity is still open, that for it to become closed would be the ultimate tragedy, but that such a closure remains a possibility. To Gebser, our fate is not assured by any notion of \\"an evolution toward\\", or by any kind of ideal way of being. Space and time Gebser notes that the various structures of consciousness are revealed by their relationship to space and time. For example, the mythical structure embodies time as cyclical/rhythmic and space as enclosed. The mental structure lives time as linear, directed or \\"progressive\\" and space becomes the box-like, vacuum-like homogeneous space of geometry. Influence Gebsers work has formed the basis of a number of other studies and writers. Ken Wilber Ken Wilber referred to and quoted Gebser (along with many other theorists) in his 1981 Up from Eden and subsequent works. Wilber found Gebser's 'pioneering' work to align to his own model of consciousness, although Wilber finds evidence for additional later mystical stages beyond Gebser's integral structure. William Irwin Thompson In his 1996 Coming into Being, cultural critic William Irwin Thompson compared Gebser's structures of consciousness to Marshall McLuhan's conception of the development of communication technology from oral culture to script culture, alphabetic culture, print culture, and then to the emerging electronic culture. Thompson applied these insights to education theory in his 2001 Transforming History: A Curriculum for Cultural Evolution. In his 2004 Self and Society: Studies in the Evolution of Consciousness, and in collaboration with the mathematician Ralph Abraham, Thompson further related Gebser's structures to periods in the development of mathematics (arithmetic, geometric, algebraic, dynamical, chaotic) and in the history of music. New Age Gebser's integral philosophy is evaluated and applied to New Age thinking about a nascent shift in consciousness in the 2006 book 2012, The Return of Quetzalcoatl by Daniel Pinchbeck. In A Secret History of Consciousness (2003) cultural historian Gary Lachman links Gebser's work to that of other alternative philosophers of consciousness, such as Owen Barfield, Rudolf Steiner, Colin Wilson, and Jurij Moskvitin.

His book, The Dogmatic Orthodox Theology (1978), made him one of the best-known Christian theologians of the second half of the 20th century. He also produced commentaries on earlier Christian thinkers, such as St Gregory of Nyssa, Saint Maximus the Confessor, and St Athanasius of Alexandria. Biography Dumitru StƒÉniloae was born on 16 November 1903, in VlƒÉdeni, in what is now Bra»ôov County, Romania. He was the last of five children of Rebeca (mother) and Irimie (father). His mother was a priest's niece. On 10 February 1917 he went to Bra»ôov to study at the Andrei »òaguna High School.

This article uses the Romanian form for the name of this city in northern Bukovina. Disappointed by the quality of the manuals and the teaching methods, he left for the University of Bucharest after one year. He was offered a fellowship by metropolitan bishop Nicolae BƒÉlan at the Metropolitan Center in Sibiu in 1924 during Lent. StƒÉniloae graduated from CernƒÉu»õi University in 1927, receiving a fellowship to study theology in Athens. In the fall of 1928 he earned his Ph.D. degree at CernƒÉu≈£i (Thesis: Life and work of Dositheos II of Jerusalem (1641-1707) and his connections with Romanian Principalities). The Metropolitan Center in Sibiu offered him a fellowship in Byzantology (?) and Dogmatics. He went to Munich to attend the courses of Prof. August Heisenberg (father of physicist Werner Heisenberg), and then went to Berlin, Paris and Istanbul to study the work of Gregory Palamas. He married on 4 October 1930, and his wife gave birth to twins in 1931, named Dumitru and Maria. He was ordained a deacon on 8 October 1931 and was ordained priest on 25 September 1932. He and his wife had another daughter, Lidia, on 8 October of the following year; and that year he became the director of Telegraful Rom√¢n (Romanian Telegraph) newspaper, meeting and befriending ultra-right ideologist Nichifor Crainic. In June 1936 he became rector of the Theological Academy in Sibiu. In 1940, at the initiative of poet Sandu Tudor, the Rugul aprins (Burning Bush) group was founded. It was composed of priest-monk Ivan Kulighin (confessor of Russian Metropolitan bishop of Rostov, refugee at Cernica Monastery), priest-monk Benedict Ghius, priest-monk Sofian Boghiu, Prof. Alex. Mironescu, poet Vasile Voiculescu, architect Constantin Joja, Father Andrei Scrima and Ion Marin Sadoveanu. The group gathered regularly at the Cernica and Antim monasteries, maintaining Christian life in Bucharest. In 1946 he was asked by metropolitan bishop Nicolae BƒÉlan, under pressure from Petru Groza, first Communist premier of Romania,First communist Premier of Romania. to resign as rector of the Theological Academy in Sibiu. He remained a professor until 1947, when he was transferred to the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Theology, as the Ascetics and Mystics chair. Because of political unrest in Romania in 1958, following a split in the Romanian Communist Party, Fr Dumitru was arrested by the Securitate on 5 September. While he was in Aiud prison, his only surviving child, Lidia, gave birth to his grandchild, Dumitru Horia. Lidia was asked to leave the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Physics because of the arrest of her father. He was freed from prison in 1963, and then began work as a clerk at the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church, and began teaching again in October. He attended conferences in Freiburg and Heidelberg at the invitation of Prof. Paul Miron, with the permission of the State Department of Cults, who wanted to change the image of Romania.In Communist Romania a trip to Western countries was not possible without approval from the regime structures. While lecturing at Oxford University, he became friends with the theologian Donald Allchin. He retired in 1973.

It is located at the intersection of the Autoroute des Laurentides (Laurentian Expressway) (A-15) and Autoroute Jean-No√´l-Lavoie (A-440).Le Carrefour Laval. Quoted: 22 July 2015. At , it is both the largest enclosed shopping centre in the Montreal area and Quebec's largest mall operating on a single floor. Carrefour Laval is one of the four self-branded fashion centres managed by Cadillac Fairview in the Montreal area. The others are Fairview Pointe-Claire, Les Promenades Saint-Bruno, and Les Galeries d'Anjou. Stores The mall has three anchor stores: Hudson's Bay, Simons and Rona, with one vacant anchor space last occupied by Sears. Various other stores, boutiques and restaurants are represented in the mall. Carrefour Laval has the reputation of being a gate for international retail chains looking to expand in Quebec and is one of the best performing shopping malls in the province in terms of sales per square foot. Several established American retailers opened their first Quebec store at Carrefour Laval notably Apple Store, Bath & Body Works, Build-A-Bear Workshop, Crate and Barrel, Victoria's Secret, Williams Sonoma and Coach New York. Non-American international retailers that had their start at Carrefour Laval include Armani Exchange, Le Creuset and Lego Store. Carrefour Laval was also the birthplace on June 30, 1994 of Rona L'Entrep√¥t, today a major big-box Canadian hardware chain.http://meteopolitique.com/fiches/caisse-depot- placement-Quebec/analyse/Intervention/Robert-Duttonet-Rona-2007.pdf History=Planning for a new mall (1969-1973) Construction of the mall was announced on February 27, 1969, by Steinberg's and Eaton's. The consortium announced that a 150-store mall would be built on a property next to the Laurentian Expressway, subject to the construction of the necessary infrastructure by the newly formed city of Laval. The project had been delayed after a zoning bylaw proposed by mayor Jacques T√©treault that would effectively have given the Carrefour Laval consortium a monopoly over the development of the proposed downtown core of Laval was challenged by the opposition and by members of his own party, who supported the construction of a second mall in the immediate vicinity by the Oshawa Group. A zoning amendment proposed by opposition councillor Lucien Paiement (later mayor), which allowed the Oshawa Group to build its own mall was adopted. By then, Morgan's and Simpson's had joined the Carrefour Laval consortium. However, Morgan's dropped out, preferring instead to anchor an expansion of the existing Centre Laval, just away on the other side of Expressway 15. Timeline *1974: Carrefour Laval opens with major tenants Simpsons, Eaton's, , Pascal's and Beaucoup.The L-shaped Carrefour Laval has 125 stores. Eaton's and Beaucoup anchor the ends of the mall and Simpsons is at the junction. Carrefour Laval has three owners: Fairview Corporation (its manager), Ivanhoe Corporation and Eaton's. *1978: Dupuis Fr√®res closes. Wise arrives in the mall. *1983: The mall double its number of tenants by expanding to the west with 125 new stores and a Sears department store. https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/cgq/1983-v27-n71-cgq2644/021612ar.pdfhttps://www.newswire.ca/news- releases/sears-unveils-new-expansion-at-carrefour-laval-537411371.html *1984: The Beaucoup concept is abandoned. Steinberg's and Miracle Mart now have their separate anchor spaces, although they remain side by side. *1985: Miracle Mart is converted to M. *1989: Simpsons is converted to The Bay. *1991: Pascal's closes. *1992: Steinberg's and M close. *1993: Bureau en Gros becomes a tenant of Carrefour Laval. Moreover, work begins to convert the space that had been occupied by Steinberg's and M to accommodate what would have been the first Costco store in Canada, but this is halted when Costco and Price Club merge the same year, since there was already a Price Club store right across the expressway. *1994: Rona L'Entrep√¥t opens up its first store ever on what used to be the anchor spaces of Steinberg's and M. *1995: Wise closes. *1996: Les Ailes de la Mode opens in the spaces of the old Pascal's and Wise stores. *1999: Eaton's closes. *2000: Cadillac Fairview acquires full ownership of the mall. Until now it had been co-owned by Ivanhoe. *2002: Carrefour Laval expands with 80 new stores and anchor Simons. This expansion took place on the former spot of the Eaton's store which had been demolished.https://www.lechodelaval.ca/actualites/affaires/161770/carrefour- laval-nouvelle-image-nouveaux-detaillants The new section is characterized on a map as the southern eastern portion of the mall with the shape of an arc. *2008: A newer, expanded food court and redesign of the flooring and ceilings is underway and scheduled to be completed in two phases by 2009.Cadillac Fairview announces a $52M investment to revitalize Carrefour Laval and its food court Retrieved 30 April 2018. The food court offers now 1,200 seats. *2009: The new food court opens with 22 fast food restaurants, 1,200 seats and an upscale restaurant, Table 51. This results in a small increase of the total size of Carrefour Laval (attributed to the northern part of the new food court) although insignificant in comparison to the mall's expansions in 1983 and 2002.

Each week, the American audience voted for their favourite act. The two acts with the fewest votes would then face the vote from the British public, where the following week the act with the fewest votes was eliminated from the contest and sent back to Britain. The series was presented by Davina McCall and the eventual winner was ex Spandau Ballet lead singer Tony Hadley, who was awarded with the prize of a recording contract.  Overview  The competitors were: Tony Hadley, Michelle Gayle, Gina G, Elkie Brooks, Dollar, Leee John (of Imagination), Haydon Eshun (of Ultimate Kaos), Sonia and Mark Shaw of Then Jerico. Controversy hit the show early on when Shaw quit the show in the first week after being criticised by other participants for his drunken behaviour prior to the recording of the first concert. Quickly, Peter Cox (of Go West) was flown in as a replacement. Contrary to the rules, Hadley, Cox, and Gina G all had at least 1 Top 40 hit (and in the case of Dollar had their only US single, \\"Shooting Star,\\" peaked at No. 74 in 1978) on the Billboard Hot 100 singles in the US, while Sonia's debut single peaked at number 10 on Billboard's Dance/Club Play Songs chart in 1990; Gina G, Cox (as part of Go West), and John's group also placed singles on the latter. Further controversy arose in the second week when acts Dollar and Sonia had received the fewest votes and were both up for the public vote. Sonia elected to leave the tour due to stress, but then decided to return to face the vote. Dollar (David Van Day and Thereza Bazar) accused her of pulling a publicity stunt to gain votes, resulting in a heated argument between the two acts, where Sonia ultimately told Van Day he was \\"a nasty piece of work\\". In the end, Dollar were voted off and Sonia continued in the show for a few more weeks. The format for the show had the artists travelling on a tour bus to a new venue each week. Each would perform one song which would relate to the city they were performing in (e.g. the concert in New Orleans would have each perform a well-known song about New Orleans). All songs performed were cover versions, until the final show where the final two (Hadley and Gayle) each sang one of their own hits. Despite his late entry to the show, Peter Cox was the favourite to win, but he finished in third place after forgetting the words to the song he was performing. The show's theme music was composed and produced by Stuart Hancock for London- based music production company Mcasso Music, and variations of this theme music were used to accompany the on-screen action between song performances. Following the show's transmission, a book and an album was released. The album contained studio recordings of various cover versions by the acts, comprising 17 songs.

It was founded in 1939 and has over 800 worldwide honorees. It is part of the MotorCities National Heritage Area. the Automotive Hall of Fame includes persons who have contributed greatly to automotive history‚Äîdefined broadly to include persons who may not be household words but who are automotive giants nonetheless. They include award recipients from advertising, car rental, dealerships, designers, racing, financiers, engineers, mechanics, drivers, executives, managers, dealers, inventors, and union officials. It includes the automotive industry, suppliers, dealers, and support. The Automotive Hall of Fame has conferred four different awards. The list of recipients can be viewed on the Automotive Hall of Fame website. * Distinguished Service Citation *Hall of Fame Induction Award *Industry Leader of the Year Award *Young Leader and Excellence Award History The Automotive Hall of Fame was founded on October 18, 1939 in New York City by a group called the \\"Automobile Old Timers.\\" Its original mission was to perpetuate the memories of early automotive pioneers and to honor people from all parts of the auto industry worldwide. For its first three decades, The Automotive Hall of Fame had four name changes. Its second iteration was \\"Automotive Old Timers\\" adopted in 1957 and intended to recognize its broader base, including automotive-related industries. In 1971 it became \\"The Automotive Organization Team.\\" Finally, it became known as \\"The Automotive Hall of Fame\\" and that resulted in greater growth. The organization moved to Washington, D.C. in 1960, sharing space in the National Automobile Dealers Association building. In 1971, it moved to Midland, Michigan where it got its first home at Northwood University. In 1997, it moved to its present home in Dearborn, Michigan, adjacent to The Henry Ford museum. It is within the MotorCities National Heritage Area, an affiliate of the U.S. National Park Service dedicated to preserving and promoting the automotive and labor history of Michigan. The current facilities are in a 25,000-square-foot building. In addition to automobile history artifacts, it contains a small theater and a central enclosed building area for public events, meetings and other exhibits. The Hall honors members of the automotive industry each year. There were 271 people inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame through 2016. These inductees include the founders of Benz, Bosch, Bugatti, Buick, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Citroen, Cord, Daimler, Dodge, Duesenberg, Durant, Duryea, Ferrari, Ford, Honda, Maybach, Olds, Peugeot, Porsche, Renault and Toyota among others. In 1946 the hall worked with the \\"National Golden Jubilee\\" (50th anniversary of the creation of the automobile). As General William S. Knudsen stated, the selection to the Hall of Fame included \\"Ten pioneers whose engineering and administrative genius made possible the present day.\\" The selection was done in cooperation with the Automobile Manufacturers Association, the \\"National Automotive Golden Jubilee committee of which Knudeson was president. Edgar Apperson, William Crapo Durant, J. Frank Jersey, Henry Ford, George O'Malley, Charles B. King, Charles W Nash, Barney Oldfield, Ransom E. Olds, and Alfred P Sloan Jr. were selected. The Hall celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2014. At annual induction ceremonies an occasion is made to honor and remember past inductees. The Hall of Fame is reported to be moving to downtown Detroit. Eligibility A person must be notable in the automobile industry to be eligible for induction. To receive the award is considered recognition that the person has made a significant contribution to the automotive industry. Along with the Hall of Fame induction awards, the Hall also honors individuals with significant awards each year. The Hall issues four types of awards: # Hall of Fame Induction, # Industry Leader of the Year, awarded to one outstanding leader each year, # Distinguished Service Citation, initiated in 1940 to honor people from the worldwide automotive industry, # Young Leadership & Excellence award, which recognizes up-and-coming future leaders of the industry. For the awards 1, 3, and 4, anyone can submit a nomination by filling out the form or sending a letter, along with reference materials that may assist the Awards Committee. The Industry Leader of the Year Award is nominated and awarded solely by the Awards Committee, so no external nominations are accepted. Inductees 1967‚Äì2019 * Giovanni Agnelli * O.

The tale also exists in medieval prose, with translations to Romanian, Russian, Dutch, Irish, Welsh, Old Norse and Yiddish. Legend Sir Bevis of Hampton (c. 1324) is a Middle English romance. It contains many themes common to that genre: a hero whose exploits take him from callow youth to hard-won maturity, ending with a serene and almost sanctified death. Supporting him are a resourceful, appealing heroine and faithful servants set against dynastic intrigue, and a parade of interesting villains, both foreign and domestic. The plot has a geographical sweep which moves back and forth from England to the Near East and through most of western Europe, replete with battles against dragons, giants, and other mythical creatures. Forced marriages, episodes of domestic violence, a myriad of disguises and mistaken identities, harsh imprisonments with dramatic escapes, harrowing rescues, and violent urban warfare fill out the protagonist's experiences. Last but not least, he has a horse of such valor that the horse's death at the end of the poem is at least as tragic as that of the heroine, and almost as tragic as that of Bevis himself. Not surprisingly though, this much variety makes the poem a difficult one to characterize with any degree of certainty, and several other factors make it a poem which is perhaps easier to enjoy than to evaluate accurately. Bevis is the son of Guy, the count of Hampton (Southampton), and Guy's young wife, who is a daughter of the King of Scotland. Discontented with her marriage, Bevis's mother asks a former suitor, Doon or Devoun, emperor of Almaine (Germany), to send an army to murder Guy in a forest. The plot succeeds, and the countess marries Doon. Threatened with future vengeance by her ten-year-old son, she determines to do away with him also, but Bevis is saved from death by a faithful tutor. Bevis is subsequently sold to pirates and ends up at the court of King Hermin, whose realm is variously placed in Egypt and Armenia. The legend continues to relate the exploits of Bevis, his defeat of Ascapart, his love for the king's daughter Josiane, his mission to King Bradmond of Damascus with a sealed letter demanding his own death, his eventual imprisonment, and his final vengeance on his stepfather. After succeeding in claiming his inheritance, however, Bevis is driven into exile and separated from Josiane, with whom he is reunited only after each of them has contracted, in form only, a second union. The story also relates the hero's death and the fortunes of his two sons. Texts Russian textile with an image of Bova Korolevich, the semifolkloric Russian adaptation of Bevis of Hampton The oldest version known, Boeve de Haumtone, is an Anglo-Norman text that dates back to the first half of the 13th century. It consists of 3,850 verses written in s. Three continental French chansons de geste of Beuve d'Hanstone, all in decasyllables, were written in the 13th century. One is preserved in BnF Fran√ßais 25516. They consist of between 10,000 and 20,000 verses. A French prose version was made before 1469. Bevers saga is an Old Norse translation of a lost version of the Anglo-Norman poem. The earliest manuscript of the saga dates to c. 1400. The English metrical romance, Sir Beues of Hamtoun (see Matter of EnglandBoundaries in medieval romance, Neil Cartlidge, DS Brewer, 2008, , 9781843841555. pp. 29‚Äì42), is founded based on some French origins, varying slightly from those that have been preserved. The oldest manuscript dates from the beginning of the 14th century. A translation into Irish survives in a 15th-century manuscript.http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T306000.html The printed editions of the story were most numerous in Italy, where Bovo or Buovo d'Antona was the subject of more than one poem, and the tale was interpolated in the Reali di Francia, the Italian compilation of Carolingian legend. An anonymous Buovo d'Antona: Cantari in ottava rima was printed in 1480, and a \\"Tuscan\\", in fact Padan of the Po Valley, version in 1497.Claudia Rosenzweig Bovo d'Antona by Elye Bokher.

His Bow- or Baba-boek, also in also in ottava rima, first appeared in print in 1547 and was regularly reprinted throughout Central and Eastern Europe until well into the 19th century. ...\\" In Russia, the romance attained an unparalleled popularity and became a part of Russian folklore. The Russian rendition of the romance appeared in mid-16th century, translated from a Polish or Old Belarusian version, which were in turn, translated from a Croatian rendition of the Italian romance, made in Ragusa. The resulting narrative, called –ü–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç—å –æ –ë–æ–≤–µ-–∫–æ—Ä–æ–ª–µ–≤–∏—á–µ (Povest' o Bove-koroleviche, lit. The Story of ), gradually merged with Russian folktales, and the principal character attained many features of a Russian folk hero (bogatyr). Since the 18th century until 1918, various versions of the Povest' had been widely circulated (particularly among the lower classes) as a lubok. Such writers as Derzhavin and Pushkin praised Bova's literary value. The latter used some elements of the Povest' in his fairy tales and attempted to write a fantasy poem based on the romance. Pushkin also praised a version of Bova by Alexander Radishchev, written in 1799. Sources R. Zenker (Boeve-Amlethus, Berlin and Leipzig, 1904) established a close parallel between Bevis and the Hamlet legend as related by Saxo Grammaticus in the Historia Danica. Some of the details that point to a common source are the vengeance of a stepfather for a father's death, the letter bearing his own death-warrant entrusted to the hero, and his double marriage. However, the motive of feigned madness is lacking in Bevis. The princess who is Josiane's rival is less ferocious than the Hermuthruda of the Hamlet legend, but she does threaten Bevis with death should he refuse her. Both seem modeled on the type of Thyrdo of the Beowulf legend. The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica characterizes the mooted etymology connecting Bevis (Boeve) with B√©owa (Beowulf), as \\"fanciful\\" and \\"inadmissible\\" on the ground that they were both dragon slayers. One alternative theory is that Doon may be identified with the emperor Otto the Great, who was the contemporary of Edgar the Peaceful, the English king Edgar of the story.

Location View in high quality) The tunnel crosses the Patapsco River, just south of Fort McHenry and connects the Locust Point and Canton areas of Baltimore City. Design and construction View of entrance to tunnel Plans for a second crossing of the Baltimore Harbor that would become the Fort McHenry Tunnel began in the late 1960s. Early plans called for an 8-lane double-deck bridge to carry I-95 over the harbor just south of Fort McHenry. In 1975, plans were changed from a bridge to a tunnel when it was determined that a bridge would have detrimental impact on Fort McHenry's status as a national monument. The state of Maryland originally intended to build the tunnel with a reinforced concrete box design, but plans were changed in February 1976 to use a steel tubular design after a dispute with the Federal Highway Administration. The tunnel was to be constructed using the immersed tube method, with prefabricated tubes sunken into the harbor. Construction began in May 1980 by the firm known as Kiewit Raymond Tidewater (K-R-T), and was completed in November 1985. 90 percent of construction costs were covered by federal funding, while 10 percent came from state funding. The tunnel consists of 32 tube sections, each wide and tall. The east and west approaches are and long, respectively.

Kenna was the sixteenth tropical depression, thirteenth tropical storm, seventh hurricane, sixth major hurricane, and third Category 5 hurricane of the 2002 Pacific hurricane season. After forming on October 22 to the south of Mexico from a tropical wave, forecasters consistently predicted the storm to strengthen much less than it actually did. Moving into an area of favorable upper-level conditions and warm sea surface temperatures, Kenna quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph (270 km/h) as a Category 5 hurricane, on October 25, while located about 255 mi (410 km) southwest of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Weakening as it turned to the northeast, the hurricane made landfall near San Blas, Nayarit as a Category 4 hurricane, with sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h), before dissipating on October 26 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. The name \\"Kenna\\" was retired from the list of Pacific hurricane names due to its effects on Mexico, which included US$101 million in damage and four deaths. The worst of the hurricane's effects occurred between San Blas in Nayarit and Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco, where over 100 people were injured and thousands of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. 95% of the buildings in San Blas were damaged, and hundreds of buildings were destroyed along coastal areas of Puerto Vallarta. Meteorological history The origin of Hurricane Kenna can be traced to a tropical wave moving westward through the Caribbean Sea on October 16, possibly the same wave that passed near Barbados two days earlier. The wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on October 19, and a tropical disturbance along the wave axis gradually became better organized. Conditions favored continued development, and Dvorak classifications began late on October 20. Early on October 22, the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E while located about 375 mi (605 km) south of Manzanillo, Colima. Initially the depression was disorganized, with little inner convective structure and sporadic deep convection. Computer models predicted an increase in wind shear by 60 hours; as such the National Hurricane Center forecast the depression to strengthen to a peak strength of 45 mph (70 km/h) before weakening. The depression quickly became better organized with a great increase in convection near the center, and six hours after forming it strengthened into Tropical Storm Kenna. Upper-level outflow and banding features improved in organization, as well. With warm water temperatures of over and updated model forecasts anticipating light amounts of vertical wind shear, forecasters predicted Kenna to slowly intensify to reach winds of 85 mph (135 km/h) within 72 hours of October 22. The storm moved to the west-northwest around the periphery of a mid-level high-pressure system, and initially failed to strengthen further with much of its convection being associated with outer rainbands. On October 23, the outer rainbands dissipated and convection became more concentrated near the center, which coincided with a steady increase in strength. Late on October 23, Kenna intensified into a hurricane while located about 380 mi (615 km) southwest of Manzanillo. Shortly after becoming a hurricane, Kenna began to rapidly intensify with a 17 mi (27 km) wide eye located within its well-defined central dense overcast. Early on October 24 Kenna became a major hurricane, and in a 24‚Äëhour period the hurricane more than doubled its windspeed from 70 mph (115 km/h) winds to 145 mph (235 km/h). After turning to the north and northeast in response to the flow ahead of a large mid to upper-level trough, Kenna attained peak winds of 165 mph (265 km/h) early on October 25 while located about 255 mi (410 km) southwest of Puerto Vallarta, the third Category 5 hurricane of the season. A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the hurricane while it was near peak intensity recorded a pressure of 913 mbar (hPa), the fourth lowest recorded pressure for a Pacific hurricane. Quickly after peaking, wind shear from the approaching trough weakened the hurricane, and by six hours after reaching peak intensity, the winds in Hurricane Kenna dropped to 150 mph (240 km/h), after the eye nearly dissipated. Despite a 27 mbar increase in pressure in 12 hours, convective activity increased prior to Kenna making landfall. On October 25, Hurricane Kenna made landfall near San Blas in the state of Nayarit, as a Category 4 hurricane, with estimated sustained winds of 140 mph (225 km/h). Hurricane Kenna was at the time, the third most intense Pacific hurricane to strike Mexico. The hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of western Mexico, and the circulation dissipated on October 26 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. The remnants continued northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern United States later that day, producing rainfall across the region. Preparations Hurricane Kenna rainfall in Mexico About 27 hours before landfall, Mexican officials issued a hurricane watch from Mazatl√°n to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, with a tropical storm watch issued further south to Manzanillo. Six hours later when its track became more apparent, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Mazatl√°n to La Fortuna, with a tropical storm warning southward to Manzanillo. Roughly 8,800 of the 9,000 residents in the landfall location, San Blas, evacuated, which ultimately contributed to a low death toll. Officials ordered for the evacuation of 50,000 residents and fishermen along the southwest coast of Mexico, including 3,000 in the Islas Mar√≠as, 10,000 near Mazatl√°n, and 15,000 near flood-prone areas. Civil authorities closed all schools and docks in potentially affected areas. The Mexican Red Cross prepared for the storm by shipping 215 tonnes of relief supplies such as food, water, clothing, and medicine to the Red Cross branch in Jalisco. Assistance from the Yucat√°n Peninsula delivered 10 tonnes of food and water, as well. The Mexican Red Cross prepared 20 emergency shelters in the state of Nayarit. Officials took security measures in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation was meeting during the passage of the hurricane. Early forecasts indicated a possible threat to the meeting, causing the government to prepare for a potential alternate site. Officials recommended boats to stay at port due to severe conditions. Impact Hurricane Kenna making landfall in Mexico on October 25 Few official surface observations are available for the passage of the hurricane. Upon making landfall, Kenna was accompanied with an estimated 16 foot (4.9 m) storm surge in San Blas. The surge also affected Puerto Vallarta, with reports of 10 foot (3 m) waves rushing inland from the bay. The hurricane dropped about 1.38 inches (35 mm) of precipitation while passing about 60 mi (95 km) east of the offshore archipelago, Islas Mar√≠as. There, sustained winds reached an estimated 106 mph (170 km/h). On land, Kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 18.91 inches (480 mm) at San Ignacio, Sinaloa, and 12.89 inches (327 mm) near Manzanillo, Colima. The highest recorded sustained wind on land was about 100 mph (161 km/h) at Tepic, Nayarit, with wind gusts at Puerto Vallarta reaching 50 mph (80 km/h). The hurricane also produced heavy rainfall in Guerrero, Michoac√°n, Colima, and Jalisco, and hit Baja California Sur with strong winds and rough seas. In San Blas, strong winds from the hurricane damaged or destroyed 95% of the homes, with 1,540 houses damaged and 8,800 people affected. There, large commercial shrimp boats were swept up to 900 feet (275 m) inland from their docks. An elderly woman died in the city when the wall of her house collapsed on her. Large portions of the city were covered with building debris and sand washed from the ocean. Elsewhere in Nayarit, flying debris killed a person in Santiago Escuintla. There, two elderly men drowned, one by falling into a river. Both were believed to have been killed during the storm as they fled their homes. In Santiago Ixcuintla, the hurricane damaged 3,770 homes, and throughout Nayarit, strong winds from the hurricane destroyed the roofs of hundreds of houses. Federal authorities lost communications with at least 30 Indian villages due to the high winds of the hurricane. Kenna destroyed the entire banana, tobacco, and tomato crops in the rural areas of San Blas, Tecuala, and Acaponeta, leaving more than 700 subsistence farmers and their families in need of water and food. In Puerto Vallarta, about 100 mi (164 km) southeast of the landfall location, the storm surge resulted in an estimated damage total of US$5 million, primarily to hotels. The surge flooded the hotels and other waterfront areas, and extended up to 330 feet (100 m) inland. Waist-deep floodwaters swept away vans and cars, ruining several vehicles. The passage of the hurricane destroyed 150 stores near the ocean and extensively damaged three hotels. Damage to the city's port was minor. The hurricane injured at least 52 in Puerto Vallarta and dozens in San Blas from widespread flying glass and other forms of debris, with two people seriously injured due to the hurricane. Ten municipalities suffered substantial damage, with insured damage in Mexico totaling . Rainfall from the hurricane spread across northern Mexico, causing minor flash floods and mudslides. The remnants of Kenna entered the south-central United States on October 26, resulting in enhanced rainfall in various locations. Aftermath Damage in Puerto Vallarta After the season had ended, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Kenna and replaced it with Karina. The Mexican government declared the region in Nayarit near the landfall of Kenna as a disaster area, allowing for the usage of emergency funds. Immediately after the passage of the hurricane, the Mexican Red Cross prepared 180 technical staff and volunteers from seven states to deliver 125 MT of food, medicine, and clothes to the areas most affected. The Mexican government deployed the Mexican Army to the area to remove fallen trees and establish water treatment plants to assist the affected population. The Mexican Navy was sent to assist to support medical personnel in the San Blas area, and the government Department for Family Development assisted the Mexican Red Cross in delivering food. Grupo Modelo, brewers of Corona beer, sent 6,600 gallons (25,000 liters) of drinking water and 1000 food sets for the San Blas area. Backhoes and dump trucks gradually removed the debris and sand from San Blas. Dozens of storeowners, municipal employees, and volunteers in Puerto Vallarta worked to clear the debris caused by the storm. The remaining stores, bars, and shops placed signs on their windows describing they were open in effort to attract the tourists still in the town. By about two months after the hurricane, most hotels, restaurants, and shops were reopened.

Life Watton- at-Stone church where Bickersteth worked with Thomas Birks He was born at Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland, the fourth son of Henry Bickersteth, a surgeon. Bickersteth attended Kirby Longsdale Grammar School and practised as a solicitor at Norwich from 1812 to 1815. Within space of only 11 days in December 1815 he was ordained both as a deacon and priest. In January 1816 travelled to Africa to inspect and report on the work of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). He continued to travel overseas in connection with the work of the CMS throughout his life. He was the secretary of the CMS from 1824 to 1831. On receiving the living of Watton, Hertfordshire, in 1830, he resigned his secretaryship, but continued to lecture and preach, both for the Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Conversion of the Jews. He was instrumental in the merger of the Anglican Central Committee and the Continental society in 1840 to form the Foreign Aid Society which supported evangelical Protestant ministry on the continent of Europe. Bickersteth met Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury in 1835. The Earl made a visit of several days to Watton Rectory in the summer 1836. Following this visit the pair became the best of friends with Bickersteth becoming one of the great reformers closest advisers.Shaftesbury, a biography of the Seventh Earl 1801-1885, p100, Georgina Battiscombe, 1974, .

Galeries d'Anjou is the smallest of the four \\"fashion centres\\" in terms of number of stores, and the only one located within the city limits of Montreal. History In 1967, the part of Radisson Street in Anjou was renamed Galeries d'Anjou Boulevard in honor of the upcoming shopping mall. Galeries d'Anjou opened in 1968 with 85 stores. Its original anchors were the department stores Simpsons and Eaton's, and the supermarkets Steinberg's and Dominion. Simpson's and Eaton's were located at the extremities of the mall, with store dimensions of 180,000 and 150,000 square feet respectively. Steinberg's and Dominion faced each another in the middle of the mall and were separated from one another by a small corridor. As a whole, Galeries d'Anjou was 800,000 square feet during its inauguration and was built on the site of a former golf course. At the time, the mall was the joint property of Simpsons Limited and Cemp Investments, and managed by Fairview Corporation. Upon its opening, Galeries d'Anjou was the second largest shopping mall in Canada after Yorkdale in Toronto. In 1975, Simpsons and Cadillac Fairview announced the expansion of Galeries d'Anjou to bring the total size of the shopping centre from 750,000 to 1.1 million square feet. As a result, 65 new stores opened on March 25, 1976 in a new mall wing that was anchored a few months later by Sears which inaugurated in August 1976. In 1987, Galeries d'Anjou had approximately 170 tenants and was anchored by Simpsons, Eaton's, Sears, Steinberg's and Provigo. Simpsons rebranded as The Bay in March 1989 and Provigo closed outright the same year. Steinberg's outlived its rival Provigo by three years in the mall until the chain's demise in 1992. Coincidentally, Steinberg's was rebranded as Provigo for a brief time in 1992 before being converted into a Maxi supermarket later in the year. The space of the original and unrelated Provigo (formerly Dominion) that closed in 1989 was revitalized into a food court, also in 1992. Galeries d'Anjou underwent through renovations for the second time of its history in 1993. The mall did not increase in size this time, but it extensively had its floors, ceilings and door entrances redone. Galeries d'Anjou's anchors at the time were The Bay, Eaton's, Sears and Maxi. After Eaton's declared bankruptcy in 1999, Hudson's Bay Company acquired the lease of its first floor at Galeries d'Anjou for a new Zellers store that opened in Spring 2000. The second floor of Eaton's was taken over by The Brick four years later on April 15, 2004. In 2002, Maxi closed to make room for an enlarged Sports Experts and new Atmosphere opened on September 3, 2003. In August 2013, Galeries d'Anjou introduced a new section of 150,000 square feet featuring Simons and some 15 other retailers. Simons itself was built on the mall's parking lot, while the small tenants took the site of the old food court (previously Dominion/Provigo) whose building was demolished to accommodate the expansion.https://web.archive.org/web/20140211181327/http://www.lesgaleriesdanjou.ca/SiteCollectionDocuments/Rep.%20Avril%202013.pdf Simons inaugurated on August 15, 2013 and was the chain's first store with a restaurant in it. The food court was relocated on the other side of the shopping centre near Zellers and replaced a former Old Navy store whose lease wasn't renewed in 2011 due to a lack of retail space at the time in the mall. Target acquired the lease of Zellers at Galeries d'Anjou, allowing it to open its own store on October 18, 2013. After Target closed all its stores in Canada in April 2015, its space at Galeries d'Anjou was left vacant for two years. Winners, Saks Off 5th and a returning Old Navy opened in 2017 in the former Target location. The Sears at Galeries d'Anjou was among the stores that closed during the chain's final day in Canada on January 14, 2018.

C. Sherriff, set in the trenches near Saint-Quentin, Aisne towards the end of the First World War. The story plays out in the officers' dugout of a British Army infantry company from 18 March 1918 to 21 March 1918, providing a glimpse of the officers' lives in the last few days before Operation Michael. The play was first performed at the Apollo Theatre in London by the Incorporated Stage Society on 9 December 1928, starring a young Laurence Olivier, and soon moved to other West End theatres for a two-year run. It was included in Burns Mantle's The Best Plays of 1928‚Äì1929. The piece quickly became internationally popular, with numerous productions and tours in English and other languages. A 1930 film version was followed by other adaptations, and the play set a high standard for other works dealing with similar themes, and influenced playwrights including No√´l Coward. It was Sherriff's seventh play. He considered calling it Suspense or Waiting, but eventually found a title in the closing line of a chapter of an unidentified book, \\"It was late in the evening when we came at last to our journey's end\\". Plot summary= Act I  In the British trenches before Saint-Quentin, Captain Hardy converses with Lieutenant Osborne, an older man and public school master, who has come to relieve him. Hardy jokes about the behaviour of Captain Stanhope, who has turned to alcohol to cope with the stress which the war has caused him. While Hardy jokes, Osborne defends Stanhope and describes him as \\"the best company commander we've got\\". Private Mason, a servant cook, often forgets about ingredients and key parts of the food that he prepares for the officers. Second Lieutenant Trotter is a rotund officer commissioned from the ranks who likes his food; he can't stand the war and counts down each hour that he serves in the front line by drawing circles onto a piece of paper and then colouring them in. Second Lieutenant James \\"Jimmy\\" Raleigh is a young and naive officer who joins the company. Raleigh knew Stanhope from school, where Stanhope was skipper at rugby; Raleigh refers to Stanhope as Dennis. Raleigh admits that he requested to be sent to Stanhope's company. Osborne hints to Raleigh that Stanhope will not be the same person he knew from school, as the experiences of war have changed him; however, Raleigh does not seem to understand. Stanhope is angry that Raleigh has been allowed to join him and describes the boy as a hero-worshipper. As Stanhope is in a relationship with Raleigh's sister Madge, he is concerned that Raleigh will write home and inform his sister of Stanhope's drinking. Stanhope tells Osborne that he will censor Raleigh's letters so this will not happen; Osborne does not approve. Stanhope has a keen sense of duty and feels that he must continue to serve rather than take leave to which he is entitled. He criticises another soldier, Second Lieutenant Hibbert, who he thinks is faking neuralgia in the eye so that he can be sent home instead of continuing fighting. Osborne puts a tired and somewhat drunk Stanhope to bed. Stanhope, as well as the other officers, refers to Osborne as \\"Uncle\\". Act II Scene 1 = Trotter and Mason converse about the bacon rashers which the company has to eat. Trotter talks about how the start of spring makes him feel youthful; he also talks about the hollyhocks which he has planted. These conversations are a way of escaping the trenches and the reality of the war. Osborne and Raleigh discuss how slowly time passes at the front, and the fact that both of them played rugby before the war and that Osborne was a schoolmaster before he signed up to fight. While Raleigh appears interested, Osborne points out that it is of little use now. Osborne describes the madness of war when describing how German soldiers allowed the British to rescue a wounded soldier in No Man's Land, while the next day the two sides shelled each other heavily. He describes the war as \\"silly\\". Stanhope announces that the barbed wire around the trenches needs to be mended. Information gathered from a captured German indicates that an enemy attack is planned to begin on Thursday morning, only two days away. Stanhope confiscates a letter from Raleigh, insisting on his right to censor it. Stanhope is in a relationship with Raleigh's sister and is worried that, in the letter, Raleigh will reveal Stanhope's growing alcoholism. Full of self- loathing, Stanhope accedes to Osborne's offer to read the letter for him. The letter is, in fact, full of praise for Stanhope. The scene ends with Stanhope quietly demurring from Osborne's suggestion to re-seal the envelope. = Scene 2 = In a meeting with the Sergeant Major it is announced that the attack is taking place on Thursday. Stanhope and the Sergeant-Major discuss battle plans. The Colonel relays orders that the General wants a raid to take place on the German trench prior to the attack, \\"a surprise daylight raid\\", all previous raids having been made under cover of darkness, and that they want to be informed of the outcome by 7 p.m. Stanhope states that such a plan is absurd, and that the General and his staff merely want this so their dinner will not be delayed. The Colonel agrees with Stanhope but says that orders are orders, and they must be obeyed. Later, it is stated that in a similar raid, after the British artillery bombardment, the Germans had tied red rag to the gaps in the barbed wire so that their soldiers knew exactly where to train their machine guns. It is decided that Osborne and Raleigh will be the officers to go on the raid, despite the fact that Raleigh has only recently entered the war. Hibbert complains to Stanhope about the neuralgia he states he has been suffering from. Stanhope replies: \\"it would be better to die from the pain, than from being shot for desertion\\". Hibbert maintains that he does have neuralgia and the right to leave the battlefield to seek treatment, but when Stanhope threatens to shoot him if he goes, Hibbert breaks down crying. He says \\"Go on then, shoot!\\", suggesting that he would rather die than stay on the battlefield. The two soldiers admit to each other that they feel exactly the same way, and are struggling to cope with the stresses that the war is putting on them. Stanhope comforts Hibbert by saying they can go on duty together. Osborne reads aloud to Trotter from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland; another attempt to escape from the realities of the war. The scene ends with the idealistic Raleigh, who is untouched by the war, stating that it is \\"frightfully exciting\\" that he has been picked for the raid. Act III Scene 1 = There is confirmation that the raid is still going ahead. The Colonel states that a German soldier needs to be captured so that intelligence can be extracted from him. Osborne admits to Stanhope that he knows he's probably not coming back, and asks Stanhope to look after his most cherished possessions and send them to his wife if he does not return after the raid. In the minutes before going over the top, Raleigh and Osborne talk about home ‚Äì the New Forest and the town of Lyndhurst ‚Äì to pass the time. Smoke-bombs are fired, the soldiers move towards the German trench, and a young German soldier is captured. However, Stanhope finds out that Osborne has been killed although Raleigh has survived. Stanhope sarcastically states, \\"How awfully nice ‚Äì if the Brigadier's pleased\\", when the Colonel's first concern is whether information has been gathered, not whether all the soldiers have returned safely. Six of ten other ranks have been killed. = Scene 2 = Trotter, Stanhope, and Hibbert drink and talk about women. They all appear to be enjoying themselves until Hibbert is annoyed when Stanhope tells him to go to bed, and he tells Stanhope to go to bed instead, then Stanhope suddenly becomes angry and begins to shout at Hibbert, and tells him to clear off and get out. Stanhope also becomes angry at Raleigh, who did not eat with the officers that night but preferred to eat with his men. Stanhope is offended by this, and Raleigh eventually admits that he feels he cannot eat while he thinks that Osborne is dead, and his body is in No Man's Land. Stanhope is angry because Raleigh had seemed to imply that Stanhope didn't care about Osborne's death because Stanhope was eating and drinking. Stanhope yells at Raleigh that he drinks to cope with the fact that Osborne died, to forget. Stanhope asks to be left alone and angrily tells Raleigh to leave. = Scene 3 = The German attack on the British trenches approaches, and the Sergeant Major tells Stanhope they should expect heavy losses. When it arrives, Hibbert is reluctant to get out of bed and into the trenches. A message is relayed to Stanhope telling him that Raleigh has been injured by a shell and that his spine is damaged, meaning he can't move his legs. Stanhope orders that Raleigh be brought into his dugout. He comforts Raleigh while Raleigh lies in bed. Raleigh says that he is cold and that it is becoming dark; Stanhope moves the candle to the bed and goes deeper into the dugout to fetch a blanket, but, by the time he returns, Raleigh has died. The shells continue to explode in the background. Stanhope receives a message that he is needed. He gets up to leave and, after he has exited, a mortar hits the dugout causing it to collapse and entomb Raleigh's corpse.  Productions (professional)  Sherriff had trouble getting Journey's End produced in the West End, writing that \\"Every management in London had turned the play down. They said people didn't want war plays [...] 'How can I put on a play with no leading lady?' one [theatre manager] had asked complainingly.\\" Sherriff used No Leading Lady as the title of his autobiography, published in 1968. Geoffrey Dearmer of the Incorporated Stage Society suggested that Sherriff send the script to George Bernard Shaw, because a good word from him would convince the ISS committee to stage it. Shaw replied that, like other sketches of trench life, it was a \\"useful [corrective] to the romantic conception of war\\", and that \\"As a 'slice of life' ‚Äì horribly abnormal life ‚Äì I should say let it be performed by all means\\". Colin Clive as Stanhope in the 1929 production of Journey's End, directed by James Whale Journey's End opened as a semi-staged production running for two nights at the Apollo Theatre. It starred Laurence Olivier, then only 21, offered the role of Stanhope by the then equally unknown director James Whale. Under a new producer, Maurice Browne, the play soon transferred to the Savoy Theatre where it ran for three weeks starting on 21 January 1929.Browne, Maurice. Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography. London, Gollancz, 1955, pp. 306-309. The entire cast from the Apollo reprised their roles (George Zucco playing Osborne and Maurice Evans Raleigh) except for Olivier, who had secured another role and was replaced by Colin Clive as Stanhope.Olivier played the part again in 1934 at a special performance for a post-war charity, with Horne and Zucco from the original cast. See \\"Special Performance of 'Journey's End'\\", The Times, 3 November 1934, p. 10 The play then transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years. Whale travelled to the United States to direct the Broadway production in 1930 at Henry Miller's Theatre. Colin Keith-Johnston played Stanhope, and Leon Quartermaine Osborne. By late 1929 the work was played by 14 companies in English and 17 in other languages, in London, New York, Paris (in English), Stockholm, Berlin, Rome, Vienna, Madrid, and Budapest, and in Canada, Australia, and South Africa. The first revival of the work was in 1934, with Horne, Stoker and Smith reprising their original roles, and Reginald Tate as Stanhope.\\"Journey's End\\", The Times, 28 November 1934, p. 12 The first New York revival was in 1939, with Keith-Johnston again playing Stanhope.\\"New York Stage, 'Journey's End' Revived\\", The Times, 25 October 1939, p. 6 There were further London revivals in 1950\\"Journey's End\\", The Times, 6 October 1950, p. 8 (which won enthusiastic praise from Field Marshal Montgomery)Letters to the Editor, The Times, 20 October 1950, p. 5 and 1972.\\"Journey's End\\", The Times, 19 May 1972, p. 11 The BBC Radio 4 Saturday Night Theatre produced the play in November 1970, with the adaptation by Peter Watts and featuring Martin Jarvis as Captain Stanhope. In 2004, the play was again revived in London, directed by David Grindley. From its initial twelve-week season at the Comedy Theatre from January 2004, it transferred to the Playhouse Theatre and the Duke of York's Theatre, finally closing on 18 February 2005. A touring company took the same production to over 30 venues across Britain in 2004 and 2005 and back to London, to the New Ambassadors Theatre from September 2005 to January 2006. Grindley's production received its Broadway debut in 2007. Starring Hugh Dancy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and Stark Sands, it opened in New York at the Belasco Theatre on 22 February 2007 and closed on 10 June after 125 performances. Grindley's production was revived in 2011 for a UK tour from March to June, and transferred to the Duke of York's Theatre in the West End from July to September. The Sell A Door Theatre Company ran this play at the Greenwich Theatre until 17 February 2013. During 2014 it was presented at the Octagon Theatre, Bolton; directed by David Thacker, it featured David Birrell, Richard Graham and, as Stanhope, James Dutton.

Productions (amateur)  Over the years there have been numerous amateur productions, the all-male cast making the play a particularly attractive choice for boys' schools, scout troops and other all-male environments. The British Scout Association owns a share of the rights to the play. During the Second World War, productions were staged by members of the Royal Natal Carbineers at El Khatatba, Egypt (January 1944); and by British prisoners in Changi Prison, Singapore (February 1943); in another Japanese labour camp on the Burma Railway at Tha Maa Kham (Tamarkan), Thailand (July 1943); in Stalag 344, near Lamsdorf, Germany (July 1944); and in Campo PG 75, near Bari, Italy.Walters 2016, pp. 368‚Äì9, 372‚Äì3. In 2015 the Shute Theatre and Arts Guild (STAG) staged a production of the play in St Michael's Church, Shute, Devon, directed by Elisabeth Miller. In August 2018 a production was staged to commemorate the end of the First World War at St John's School, Leatherhead, and the Leatherhead Theatre, directed by Graham Pountney. In September 2018 a production was staged by Fintry Amateur Dramatic Society (FADS), in \\"The Studio\\", a converted barn outside Killearn, Stirling. Adaptations=Film In 1930, James Whale directed an eponymous film based on the play, starring Colin Clive, David Manners and Ian Maclaren.\\"Journey's End\\", The Times, 15 April 1930, p. 14 A German remake, The Other Side (Die andere Seite), was directed by Heinz Paul in 1931. The play is the basis for the film Aces High (1976), although the action was switched from the infantry to the Royal Flying Corps. A second eponymous English film adaptation was released in 2017, with a wider theatrical release in Spring 2018. Television The play was televised by the BBC Television Service, live from its Alexandra Palace studios, on 11 November 1937, in commemoration of Armistice Day. Condensed into a one-hour version by the producer George More O'Ferrall, some short sequences from the film Westfront 1918 (1930) by G. W. Pabst were used for scene-setting purposes. Reginald Tate starred as Stanhope, with Basil Gill as Osborne, Norman Pierce as Trotter, Wallace Douglas as Raleigh, J. Neil More as the Colonel, R. Brooks Turner as the Company Sergeant-Major, Alexander Field as Mason, Reginald Smith as Hardy, and Olaf Olsen as the young German soldier. Because it was broadcast live, and the technology to record television programmes did not exist at the time, no visual records of the production survive other than still photographs. The play was adapted for television in 1988, starring Jeremy Northam as Stanhope, Edward Petherbridge as Osborne, and Timothy Spall as Trotter. It held close to the original script although there were changes, the most obvious being the depiction on camera of the raid, which happens off-stage in the theatre production. Legacy Other plays of the period dealing with the war tended to be judged by the standard of Journey's End.Purkis 2016. The play and its characters also influenced other writers. In 1930, No√´l Coward briefly played the role of Stanhope while on tour in the Far East. He did not consider his performance successful, writing afterwards that his audience \\"politely watched me take a fine part in a fine play and throw it into the alley.\\"Coward, Present Indicative, p. 304 However, he was \\"strongly affected by the poignancy of the play itself\\", and was inspired to write Post-Mortem, his own \\"angry little vilification of war\\", shortly afterwards.Lesley, p. 140 An alternate- timeline version of Raleigh appears in the 1995 novel The Bloody Red Baron by Kim Newman. The final series of the British comedy programme Blackadder (Blackadder Goes Forth) focuses on the same theme and setting, sometimes with heavy parallels. In Withnail & I the out-of-work actor Marwood (played by Paul McGann) is seen reading a copy of the play in the holiday cottage and goes on to win a role in a touring production by the close of the film.

A journeyman, Barrowman played for 15 different sides during his career, including Rangers, Ross County and Dunfermline Athletic in Scotland and Birmingham City and Walsall in England. Career=Birmingham City Barrowman was born in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire. He joined Birmingham City at the age of 16, having been with Rangers for four years as a schoolboy. In 2002, he represented Scotland under-19s in the first qualifying round for the 2003 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. He had previously represented Scotland at other youth levels. He signed his first senior contract at Birmingham for the start of the 2003‚Äì04 season, but made his debut in the Football League as a Crewe Alexandra player, in a match against Bradford City on 14 October 2003, after signing on a month-long loan. He hit his first goal in his next match, a 3‚Äì0 victory against Derby County four days later. Between November and the close of the season, he played once in the Premier League for Birmingham City, at home against Leicester City. In the summer of 2004, his contract was renewed. Loaned to Blackpool for the first three months of the 2004‚Äì05 season, Barrowman made his debut against Sheffield Wednesday, coming on as a substitute in a 2‚Äì1 home loss. He walked out on the club after another substitute appearance. Walsall Barrowman would prove never to become a regular squad member at St Andrew's. In January 2006 he signed for Walsall. He made his debut in a 5‚Äì0 defeat to Brentford, which proved to be the final act of manager Paul Merson's spell as manager. Barrowman gave away a penalty in this game with a \\"bizarre handball\\" with the score at 4‚Äì0. His fortunes improved the week after when he helped to rescue a point on his home debut against Scunthorpe United. With Walsall down to ten men, Barrowman latched onto a long ball and lobbed the goalkeeper to make it 2‚Äì2. Return to Scotland On 26 July 2006, Barrowman returned to Scotland and signed a one- year contract with Scottish Premier League club Kilmarnock, but after initially failing to break into the first team he joined Queen of the South on a month's loan during September. This loan deal was subsequently extended until the end of December. On 1 February 2007, after his release from Rugby Park, he signed a short-term contract with Queen of the South until the end of the season. Barrowman scored once for Queen of the South, his goal coming in a 2‚Äì2 draw against future club Dundee on 17 March 2007. He signed for Ross County for the 2007‚Äì08 season. He hit terrific form during his first season with County, scoring a total of 29 goals, 24 in the league, which helped the club to win the Second Division championship. In late May he turned down a contract extension with County in the hope of moving to a bigger club. Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager Craig Brewster captured his main transfer target on 25 June 2008 when, after much deliberation, Barrowman committed himself to a three-year contract with the club. He scored on his league debut in a 2‚Äì0 win over Aberdeen. Despite scoring on his debut, Barrowman struggled to live up to his potential and found himself in and out of the Inverness team in his first season. Ross County, Dunfermline & Dundee On 1 February 2010, Barrowman re-signed for title challengers Ross County on an 18-month deal after securing a release from Inverness. He contributed an assist for the second goal as Ross County eliminated Celtic on their way to the 2010 Scottish Cup Final. Barrowman played the whole game as Ross County lost 3‚Äì0 to Dundee United. On 12 October 2010, he returned to first-team duty after two months out with a broken foot to score a late equaliser against Partick Thistle in the semi-final of the Scottish Challenge Cup; Ross County won the penalty shootout to qualify for the final. He then scored the opening goal in the final as Ross County won the trophy beating Queen of the South 2‚Äì0. On 3 June 2011, he left Ross County to join SPL newcomers Dunfermline Athletic on a two- year contract. On 26 March 2013, Dunfermline applied to enter into administration Two days later the club announced that eight players had been made redundant with Barrowman amongst them. On 31 March 2013, it was announced that Barrowman had signed a deal with Dundee until the end of the season, following his release from Dunfermline. Livingston, Morton and return to Dunfermline Barrowman signed for Livingston on 23 August 2013, in a deal lasting through to January 2014. He then extended his contract until the end of the season. He was released in May 2014. After leaving Livingston, Barrowman signed for League One side Greenock Morton. He was released by mutual consent in January 2015. On 13 January 2015, the same day he left Morton, Barrowman signed for former club Dunfermline Athletic on a short term six-month deal. The switch was part of a swap deal which saw Ross Forbes go the other way and head to Morton. He made his second Dunfermline debut at the first opportunity, starting in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Airdrieonians on 17 January 2015. Albion Rovers In July 2015, Barrowman signed for Albion Rovers alongside former Raith Rovers midfielder Mark Ferry. His season with Rovers was hampered by injury, though he did make 25 appearances across all competitions, scoring 4 times for the Scottish League One side. At the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season, Barrowman confirmed his retirement from football. Towards the end of his playing career, Barrowman had started a degree course in business management. Arthurlie In the 2018-2019 season, Barrowman made a return to football with Junior club Arthurlie where he made a handful of appearance before going back into retirement due to injury. Post-career After retiring at the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season, Barrowman became Scottish brand manager for sportswear firm Joma at the beginning of 2017.

GUS is an abbreviation of Great Universal Stores, the company's name before 2001. On 10 October 2006, the company was split into two separate companies: Experian which continues to exist, and Home Retail Group which was bought by Sainsbury's in 2016. History Universal Stores was founded in 1900 as a mail-order business in Manchester, England by Abraham, George and Jack Rose. A private company, Universal Stores (Manchester) Ltd, took the business over, and the company was incorporated in 1917. In 1930, the company changed its name to Great Universal Stores Limited. The next year it was listed on the London Stock Exchange. At this stage, it was the leading mail order business in the UK, with a single catalogue, Great Universal. A second catalogue, John England, was launched later in the 1930s. In 1932, Isaac Wolfson joined the company as merchandise controller. He became joint managing director in the same year. He was chairman from the late 1940s until his retirement in 1987. Through his wealth gained at Great Universal Stores, he established the Wolfson Foundation in 1955. His son, Leonard Wolfson, followed him as chairman, to be succeeded by David Wolfson (1996‚Äì2000). Great Universal acquired Kay & Company Ltd. in 1937, and continued to run its catalogue, Kays, as a separate title. Based in Worcester, Kay & Company began life in the 1880s and was an established mail order company at the time of the GUS takeover. Two chains of furniture stores were acquired by GUS, one in 1943 and one in 1945. These stores continued to trade under the names Cavendish or Woodhouse. This was followed in 1958 by the acquisition of a paint and wall covering chain of shops, which GUS expanded to form a much larger and more comprehensive chain of DIY stores. GUS also purchased or developed stores selling women's and children's clothing, buying up the Burberry's and Scotch House businesses in 1955. Burberry's also included a clothing manufacturing business. GUS developed its manufacturing businesses in the 1950s, with products including clothing, bedding, upholstery, textiles and pottery. GUS acquired A & S Henry & Co group in 1971. This group was primarily a group of manufacturing businesses, which GUS sold off, and a mail order business trading as John Noble which GUS retained. This was followed in 1976 by the acquisition of S & U Stores Ltd with its catalogues, Greenbank and Meridien; the acquisition of Henry Wigfall & Son Ltd in 1977 along with its catalogues All Yours, Wigfalls at Home and Choice Mail Order, and in 1981 GUS acquired the John Myers Home Shopping catalogue business from UDS Group plc. Unlike Kay & Company, all of these acquisitions were brought into the main GUS business and not run as distinct companies. So there were two mail order companies within the GUS group at this stage: the British Mail Order Corporation Ltd (BMOC) and Kay & Company Ltd. By 1983 the company had expanded its range of operations significantly. Catalogue mail order was by far the company's primary business but the company was also engaged in retailing through shops, the manufacture of clothing and household goods, financial services, property investment and travel. By this time the business was international, with operations in Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Austria, Canada, South Africa and Australia and smaller interests in Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, the United States and Hong Kong. The company acquired Argos in 1998 and the UK's second largest online retailer at the time, Jungle.com, in 2000 for ¬£37 million. In 2001 the company changed its name to GUS plc using the identifier GUS on the London Stock Exchange. In November 2002, Homebase was acquired by GUS plc for ¬£900 million, where it formed part of the Argos Retail Group. The previous month, GUS had announced that the Jungle.com business was also to be merged into the ARG division of the business and run from Argos' Milton Keynes headquarters. From early in the year the Home Shopping division also embarked on a successful turnaround strategy helped by advisers managed by Rob Wherrett of Zymolysis. In 2004, the company sold its traditional home shopping (catalogues) division to the Barclay twins, who later merged the Littlewoods mail order operations into it. This included the iconic Great Universal Stores catalogue, from which the company took its name, and completed the departure of GUS from its original business areas. Around the same time, the Barclays announced the closure of the Littlewoods Index catalogue showroom chain, the principal rival to Argos in the UK, selling around 35 stores to Argos. Following a reorganization led by Victor Barnett, it was announced in May 2005 that GUS would divest its stake in Burberry by distributing Burberry shares to its own shareholders. The Burberry demerger was completed in December 2005. On 28 March 2006, it was announced that the company would split into two separate businesses, Home Retail Group and Experian, with both companies listed separately on the London Stock Exchange as of 11 October 2006. GUS plc became a wholly owned subsidiary of Experian plc after the demerger and was renamed Experian Finance plc. GUS plc ranked as the highest-spending online advertiser in the US, according to Nielsen NetRatings, spending over $US659m in 2006.The Most Tivo'd Shows: Naughty or Nice for Advertisers? The next-ranked online advertiser, Vonage, had sales of just over $US294m.

Charles Wolfson, formerly president, became chairman as of 1 January 1963, and John P. Adderley became president and chief executive officer. In the early 1990s the Canadian company was fined $45,000 (Canadian) for misleading advertising, the largest total fine during that fiscal year. At that point, the company was doing business under the name of L√©gar√© Woodhouse in Montreal and elsewhere in Quebec.

It is situated in Cumberland East Bay on the northeastern coast of the island. The settlement is the smallest capital in the world by population. It is sometimes confusingly referred to as Grytviken, which is the site of the disused whaling station, nearby at the head of King Edward Cove. History The area was explored by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1901-04 under Otto Nordenski√∂ld. It was named around 1906 after King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Since 1909, King Edward Point has been the residence of a British Magistrate administering the island. In 1925, the government of the United Kingdom established Discovery House, a marine laboratory for Discovery Investigations. Research station On 1 January 1950, the station ownership was assumed by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. The station was manned from 1 January 1952 to 13 November 1969. The British Antarctic Survey provided the British presence at the station until 1982. At the beginning of the Falklands War on 3 April 1982, Argentine forces occupied South Georgia and closed the station. They were soon expelled during Operation Paraquet and British military forces occupied the point. A series of civilian Marine Officers was appointed to carry out customs and fisheries duties for the South Georgia Government from 1991, and were billeted with the small garrison. On 22 March 2001, the British Antarctic Survey reopened the station on behalf of the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI). Most of the old, dilapidated (and arguably historic) buildings were destroyed to make way for new ones, with the exception of Discovery House (1925) and the Gaol (1912). Currently twelve BAS personnel overwinter at the station, rising to around 22 in summer. Two Government Officers plus partners are stationed on KEP, overlapping by about three months during the busy winter fishing season. Summer staff from the Museum at Grytviken are also accommodated at KEP. The continued occupation of the station serves a political purpose as well: it helps to maintain British sovereignty against Argentina's claim for ownership of the territory. The chief activities of the station are applied fisheries research on behalf of the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, to assist its policies for sustainable management of the commercial fishery, and to provide logistic support for the Government Officer(s).

Life He arrived in South Africa with his parents as 1820 Settlers. His father, Dr John Atherstone, was appointed District Surgeon of Uitenhage in 1822. William, a young man of wide interests and outstanding ability, received his first training at Dr James Rose Innes's academy in Uitenhage, being at first apprenticed to his father and then serving as Assistant-Surgeon in the Sixth Frontier War 1834-1835. In 1836 he studied medicine in Dublin and was admitted as M.R.C.S. the following year, obtaining an MD in Heidelberg, Germany in 1839, returning to Grahamstown in the same year and joining his father in practice. He carried out research in lung- sickness, horse-sickness and tick-borne fever and was in 1847 the first surgeon outside Europe and America to perform an amputation using an anaesthetic. This operation, on 16 June 1847, was performed on the Albany Deputy Sheriff, Mr F Carlisle, and was completely successful. On recovering from the anaesthetic, the patient said \\"What? My leg is off? Impossible - I can't believe it!....It's the greatest discovery ever made\\".Graham's Town Journal 26 June 1847S Afr J Med 1897; IV; Parts 11 and 12: 243-7 In 1839 his interest was aroused in geology, and from that date he devoted the leisure resulting from a long and successful medical career to the pursuit of geological science. In 1857 he published an account of the rocks and fossils of Uitenhage.R Tate, Quart. Journal Geol. Soc., 1867 He also studied many fossil reptilia from the Karroo beds, and sent specimens to the British Museum. These were described by Sir Richard Owen. Atherstone's identification, in 1867, with the help of Peter MacOwan and HG Galpin, of a crystal found at De Kalk near Hopetown, as the Eureka Diamond - the first found in Africa - led indirectly to the establishment of the diamond industry of South Africa. He encouraged the workings at Jagersfontein, and he also called attention to the diamandiferous pipe at Kimberley. He was partly responsible for the foundation of the Grahamstown library, botanical garden and, in 1855, the Albany Museum. He traveled widely in the eastern Cape, Namaqualand and the Transvaal, collecting minerals, fossils, plant specimens and seeds, sending material to Hooker at Kew. He was a friend of Andrew Geddes Bain of pass-building fame. He was made F.R.C.S. in 1863 and F.G.S in 1864. He represented Grahamstown as Member of Parliament from 1881 to 1883 whence he was elected to the Legislative Council where he served until 1891. He is commemorated in the genus Atherstonea Pappe and in the names of various fossil reptiles. He was one of the founders of the Geological Society of South Africa at Johannesburg in 1895.

It was founded by Mother Angelica, PCPA, in 1980 and began broadcasting on August 15, 1981, from a garage studio at the Our Lady of the Angels Monastery in Irondale, Alabama, which Mother Angelica founded in 1962. She hosted her own show, Mother Angelica Live, until suffering a major stroke and other health issues in September 2001. Repeats now air as either the Best of Mother Angelica Live or Mother Angelica Live Classics. From then until her death on Easter Sunday of 2016, she led a cloistered life at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Hanceville, Alabama. Regular network programs include a daily Holy Mass and sometimes Tridentine Mass format, the traditional Stations of the Cross, a taped daily recitation of the Rosary, and daily and weekly news, discussion, and Catechetical programs for both adults and children. Christmas and Easter programming; the installation Masses of bishops and cardinals; coverage of World Youth Days; and papal visits, deaths, funerals, conclaves, and elections are also presented. Spanish language broadcasts are available on all platforms. On December 8, 2009, EWTN began broadcasting high-definition television. The network's current chairman of the board and chief executive officer is Michael P. Warsaw. While the network has trustees, it does not have shareholders or owners. A majority of the network's funding is from viewer donations about which it advertises 100% viewer supported, which keeps it from advertising secular or non-Catholic programming. Its traditional plea for donations is \\"Keep us between your gas and electric bill\\".According to Father Andrew Apostoli, TV host of EWTN: Sunday Night Prime, the saying is derived from the practice of Mother Angelica asking Jesus Christ for financial help, by placing a letter of request between the gas and electric bill (sometimes gas and telephone bill). The saying was later adopted for benefactors who donate to EWTN, in response to propagating its ministry. EWTN contributes to the publication of the National Catholic Register newspaper, which it acquired in January 2011, and to reports of Catholic News Agency, which it also owns. The network maintains an online presence through its primary site, EWTN.com, and it has a dedicated commercial site, EWTNReligiousCatalogue.com. EWTN also has a 24 hour radio network, offering Catholic talk and worship programming to about 350 radio stations around the U.S. as well as SiriusXM Satellite Radio and shortwave radio. Some of the schedule is the audio from EWTN television shows and some is original programming for radio listeners. As of 2017, Michael P. Warsaw, who is a consultant to the Vatican's Dicastery for Communications, leads EWTN.  Development  EWTN's main studio in Irondale, Alabama Mother Angelica made her profession of vows in 1953. In 1962 she established Our Lady of the Angels monastery. During the 1970s, she was an in- demand lecturer and produced pamphlets and audio and video tapes. She had been a guest on local station WBMG (currently WIAT, Channel 42), and on shows on the Christian Broadcasting Network and the Trinity Broadcasting Network. After she gave an interview on then-Christian station WCFC (Channel 38) in Chicago, she decided she wanted her own network. \\"I walked in, and it was just a little studio, and I remember standing in the doorway and thinking, 'It doesn't take much to reach the masses'. I just stood there and said to the Lord, 'Lord, I've got to have one of these'\\". Mother Angelica purchased satellite space and EWTN began broadcasting on August 15, 1981, with four hours of daily programming, which included her own show, Mother Angelica Live (aired bi- weekly), a Sunday Mass, and reruns of older Catholic programs such as Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen's Life Is Worth Living. The remainder of the time was filled with shows produced by dioceses across the country, shows from Protestant sources which Mother Angelica determined were in concert with Catholic teachings, and children's shows such as Joy Junction and The Sunshine Factory. About one-third of programming time consisted of secular content, such as re-runs of The Bill Cosby Show, public domain films, and cooking and western-themed shows. EWTN eventually increased its broadcast schedule to six hours per day and then to eight hours per day by 1986. Secular content was gradually reduced from 1986 to 1988, and satellite distribution was expanded late in 1987, after which EWTN acquired a far more desirable satellite channel and began broadcasting around the clock. At this point, EWTN began broadcasting the praying of the rosary on a daily basis and added a number of educational shows. In-house production of original programming gradually increased. The Mass became televised daily in 1991 from a chapel on the monastery grounds. Most shows from non-Catholic sources were eliminated and a more theological image gradually developed.  Radio  In 1992, EWTN established the largest privately owned shortwave radio station, WEWN, in the vicinity of Birmingham, Alabama. In 1996, Mother Angelica announced that EWTN would make its radio signal available via satellite to AM and FM stations throughout the United States at no cost. In 1999, programs included Mother Angelica Live and \\"Life Is Worth Living\\" with Fulton J. Sheen. WGSN in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, was an affiliate.Toby Eddings, \\"Time to get back on the 'Soul Train',\\" The Sun News, May 30, 1999. Current radio programs include Open Line in which callers can have their questions regarding the Catholic Faith answered. In 2004, EWTN announced an agreement with Sirius Satellite Radio, which thereafter merged with XM Satellite Radio to become Sirius XM Satellite Radio. EWTN broadcasts on Channel 130 on Sirius XM. As of August 2020, EWTN Radio is affiliated with 384 stations in the United States and more than 500 stations globally.  Newspapers  In January 2011, EWTN acquired the National Catholic Register, a newspaper founded in Denver, Colorado, in 1924 as a periodical for local Catholics, and which became a national publication three years later. EWTN officially assumed total control on February 1, 2011. EWTN also owns 'Catholic News Agency' which is a Catholic news service with bureaus across America, Latin America and Europe.  News coverage  The EWTN news department produces a daily news service for television and radio, featuring news sources including Vatican Radio. It also produces The World Over Live, which reports relevant current events. Journalist and author Raymond Arroyo, who is EWTN's news director, hosts the program. The program is conservative in its political orientation and generally conservative in its religious orientation. Notable guests have included Robert Rector of The Heritage Foundation, author and activist George Weigel, political commentator Laura Ingraham, conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan, and the late columnist and commentator Robert Novak, a Jewish convert to the Catholic Faith.  History of programming  Capitol Hill reporter Erik Rosales interviewing Congresswoman Debbie Lesko in 2020. In its early history, EWTN broadcast Catholic programming from a great variety of Catholic sources, which ranged from Catholic charismatic programming, such as that of Fr. Michael Manning, to programs focusing on social reform and social justice, such as Christopher Closeup, to doctrinal programs hosted by clergy. In the early 1990s, EWTN began producing more of its own programs. This effort marked a conspicuously conservative shift in its overall orientation, with programs on topics of social reform and justice gradually eliminated and replaced by programs on doctrine and programs of dialogue. The shift was apparent in the daily televised Masses, which, in 1992, began incorporating Latin into the liturgy and gradually eliminated contemporary music. Some untelevised Masses are totally in English and some include more contemporary music. On Christmas Eve of 1993, Mother Angelica and the nuns of her order reverted to traditional habits. From 1992 on, the Latin portions of the Mass included the Gloria, introduction of the Gospel readings, the Sanctus, and the remainder of the Mass after the Great Amen, beginning with the Lord's Prayer. Among its notable weekly programs are The Journey Home and Life on the Rock. The Journey Home, hosted by Marcus Grodi, presents converts to the Catholic Faith. Grodi is a former Presbyterian minister who converted to the Catholic Faith in 1992. Although most guests are former Protestants, former members of non-Christian faiths (such as Judaism) and former atheists occasionally appear. Life on the Rock is hosted by Rev. Mark Mary, MFVA. The HD feed first became available to Comcast customers in Richmond, Virginia, and its vicinity on May 11, 2010. In October 2011, EWTN became available through the Roku streaming player. The player provides six live channels of EWTN at no cost, including English, Spanish, and German languages, thus permitting users to view the channel on their televisions. In addition, select EWTN programs can be viewed through the video on demand option, and a live feed of EWTN Radio is available.Another EWTN First: Catholic Network To Launch on Roku Retrieved October 19, 2011 Often, EWTN airs special programming ‚Äî holiday-specific programs; coverage of the deaths of Supreme Pontiffs; Papal conclaves, Papal elections, inaugurations, and visits; Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Easter Masses; installations of bishops, archbishops, and cardinals; and World Youth Days. EWTN's top news program EWTN News Nightly was hosted by veteran journalist Lauren Ashburn, who was previously with Fox News Channel. The show is produced by Rodney Harris and Anna Laudiero. Ashburn left EWTN in July 2019 in order to spend more time with her children.  Criticism  In a 1993 episode of Mother Angelica Live, Mother Angelica harshly criticized a mimed re-enactment of the Stations of the Cross at the World Youth Day in Denver, Colorado, which Pope John Paul II attended. Mother Angelica was angered that a woman was playing Jesus. Archbishop Rembert Weakland of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee criticized Mother Angelica's comment as \\"one of the most disgraceful, un-Christian, offensive, and divisive diatribes I have ever heard\\". Mother Angelica responded that \\"He didn't think a woman playing Jesus was offensive? He can go put his head in the back toilet as far as I am concerned!\\" In 1997, Mother Angelica publicly criticized Cardinal Roger Mahony, then Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, for his pastoral letter on the Eucharist, \\"Gather Faithfully Together: A Guide for Sunday Mass\\", which she perceived as lacking emphasis on transubstantiation: \\"I'm afraid my obedience in that diocese would be absolutely zero. And I hope everybody else's in that diocese is zero\\".Margaret O'Brien Steinfels Liturgical confusion-criticism over a pastoral letter Editorial, Commonweal, January 30, 1998 Cardinal Mahony regarded her comments as accusing him of heresy.John L. Allen, Jr. Mahony sees nun's critique as heresy charge-Cardinal Roger Mahony; dispute with televangelist Mother M. Angelica, National Catholic Reporter, Dec 5, 1997. Mother Angelica later conditionally apologized for her comments. In 1999, Bishop David E. Foley of the Diocese of Birmingham, Alabama, issued a decree prohibiting priests in his diocese from celebrating Mass ad orientem (which literally denotes \\"to the east\\", toward the altar) under most circumstances. Although the decree did not specifically name EWTN, supporters and critics generally agreed that the decree, which applied to \\"... any Mass that is or will be televised for broadcast or videotaped for public dissemination\\", was authored specifically to target EWTN. Bishop Foley stated that the practice of the priest celebrating ad orientem \\"amounts to making a political statement and is dividing the people.\\"John L. Allen, Jr. EWTN's bishop says priests must face the people-Eternal Word Television Network-Brief Article, National Catholic Reporter November 19, 1999.  Case of Francis Mary Stone  In 2007, Francis Mary Stone, an ordained Catholic priest who hosted the network's show Life On The Rock, was suspended from the network after it was revealed that he violated his vow of celibacy and fathered a child with EWTN employee Christina Presnell. Stone was forced on leave of absence, and Presnell was fired from EWTN. By 2018, he was reported to be suspended from his religious order.  Apostolic visitation  In 2000, Archbishop Roberto Gonz√°lez Nieves of San Juan, Puerto Rico, performed an apostolic visitation of EWTN. Nieves focused on three issues ‚Äî the actual ownership of the network; the associated monastery's right to donate property to EWTN; and, since she had never been elected, the authority of Mother Angelica. Mother Angelica decided that the future of the network would be in danger if she did not sever all ties to it, which she did, ceding control to a lay board of directors.  Papal Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice Award  In 2009, the Holy See bestowed the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice award on Mother Angelica and the leaders of EWTN to express gratitude for their service to the Church.  Viewership  EWTN is the largest religious media network in the world, and it says it has a reach of a quarter-billion people in 140 countries. The network is unrated in the United States, though various articles cite millions of viewers watch per month. On YouTube and other social media platforms, EWTN has more than 1,000,000 active followers and online viewers. EWTN is also available on demand on streaming services Roku, Kindle, and Apple TV. EWTN's Internet site is viewed three to four million times monthly, according to SimilarWeb. In the United States, EWTN is available through most cable and satellite providers with a reach of around 70 million households. EWTN had an annual revenue of $60,084,643 in 2016, and holds an 86% positive rating through Charity Navigator.  List of programs  Branding  EWTN's logo has incorporated a globe outline in some form since the network's launch in 1981 to suggest the network's hope of a worldwide reach, usually with an outline of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica within a profile of a satellite dish inside of it. The network had the sub-branding of the \\"Catholic Cable Network\\" until 1995, when with the launch of DirecTV and Dish direct satellite broadcasters (where it was a charter network with both providers) it took a new sub-branding of \\"International Catholic Network\\", then \\"Global Catholic Network\\" in 1996 after uploading its signal for worldwide viewing.

Hatem Memorial Bridge is a road bridge in northeast Maryland that crosses the Susquehanna River between Havre de Grace and Perryville via Garrett Island. It carries U.S. Route 40. It is the oldest of the eight toll facilities operated and maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority, and the southernmost automotive bridge across the Susquehanna. It is named for Thomas J. Hatem, whose long involvement in Harford County politics (as a Democrat) includes one term in the Maryland House of Delegates, a long stint as a county commissioner, service as state insurance commissioner and six years on the Public Service Commission. Background The bridge was far from the first crossing of the Susquehanna River between the Harford County community of Havre de Grace and the Cecil County town of Perryville. A succession of ferries made the trip for more than 200 years, and two railroad bridges were constructed during the last half of the 19th century. The first vehicle bridge was converted from a railroad bridge constructed in 1873. It opened in 1910, and was operated by a group of private citizens as a toll facility until 1923. The State Roads Commission (SRC), predecessor of the Authority, bought the bridge in 1923 and continued to operate it as a toll facility. The structure was extremely narrow, with a roadway only wide. Heavy trucks inched past each other, and there were many side-swiping accidents on the bridge. Traffic usually moved at a snail‚Äôs pace. To alleviate the problem, the SRC in 1926 built a second deck over the old bridge, converting each level into a crossing for one-way traffic. This project was considered one of the most ingenious bridge-engineering feats of the time. Then new problems surfaced. The new deck had a vertical clearance of -- barely sufficient to accommodate the growing number of commercial vehicles traveling the bridge in the 1930s. Frequently, trucks stacked too high with freight became wedged between the deck and the overhead structure and could proceed only after their tires were deflated to allow adequate clearance. The need for a newer, more modern structure became apparent in the mid-1930s. At the same time, the Maryland General Assembly authorized the State Roads Commission to formulate a comprehensive plan for the construction of bridges and tunnels across major bodies of water in Maryland. These projects would be financed and operated through toll funding. The plan developed by the SRC was ratified by the United States Congress in 1938 under its regulatory powers over navigable waterways. The plan became known as Maryland‚Äôs Primary Bridge Program and provided, among other projects, for the construction of a bridge across the Susquehanna River parallel to the overtaxed double-decker structure. Construction of this new span, which was designed by the J. E. Greiner Company, began in February 1939 and was completed at a cost of $4.5 million. Postcard image c.1940s Operations The bridge, named the Susquehanna River Toll Bridge, opened to traffic on August 28, 1940. The obsolete double-decker bridge was later demolished (there was an effort to keep it for local traffic, but then its steel was taken for the war effort). The first toll collectors at the bridge were all men; this changed as World War II drew men to military service and women took over traditionally male-dominated jobs. Exact-change lanes were a novelty in toll collection when they were installed at the bridge in 1958. Their contribution to efficient toll collection was overshadowed in 1976 with the introduction of AVI (Automatic Vehicle Identification) decals. AVI works on the same principle as automated checkouts at retail stores, and the decal itself looks like a large universal-product code symbol commonly found on many items. The bridge was renamed after Thomas Hatem died in 1985 at age 59; the official renaming took place in May 1986. In 1991, a one-way toll collection system was introduced, and the $8.00 toll is now collected in the eastbound direction only. The barcode decal, for $10, is no longer issued. Motorists may purchase the Thomas Hatem Bridge Plan for a Maryland E-ZPass. This plan costs $20 for 12 months' unlimited use. In April 2019, MDTA announced that the bridge will become a cashless toll facility by October 2019. With this system, customers without E-ZPass will pay using video tolling. Cashless tolling began on the bridge on October 16, 2019. In 2012, Harford Transit introduced bus service across the bridge, linking Havre de Grace and Perryville. Bicycles were long prohibited on the bridge, which lacks a safe shoulder. On July 1, 2016, the bridge opened to bicyclists, along with lights to warn drivers about bicycles in the travel lanes. Initially, bicyclists were allowed to use the bridge all week long, with limited hours on weekdays, but since September 6, 2016, bicycle passage has been restricted to weekends, holidays, and other designated dates. Bicycle usage in the first two months was minimal, but Maryland officials said the change was unrelated. See also  List of crossings of the Susquehanna River * Millard E.

The idea of a Mediterranean cuisine originates with the cookery writer Elizabeth David's book, A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950) and was amplified by other writers working in English. Many writers define the three core elements of the cuisine as the olive, wheat, and the grape, yielding olive oil, bread and pasta, and wine; other writers emphasize the diversity of the region's foods and deny that it is a useful concept. A common definition of the geographical area covered follows the distribution of the olive tree. The region spans a wide variety of cultures with distinct cuisines, in particular (going anticlockwise around the region) the Maghrebi, Egyptian, Levantine, Ottoman (Turkish), Greek, Italian, Proven√ßal (French), and Spanish, though some authors include additional cuisines. Portuguese cuisine, in particular, is partly Mediterranean in character. The historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region's climate and economy, mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil, bread, and wine, such as roast lamb or mutton, meat stews with vegetables and tomato (for example, Spanish andrajos), vegetable stews (Proven√ßal ratatouille, Spanish pisto, Italian ciambotta),Anthony F. Buccini, \\"Western Mediterranean Vegetable Stews and the Integration of Culinary Exotica\\", Authenticity in the Kitchen, Proceedings of the 2005 Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, published 2006, , p. 132 and the salted cured fish roe, bottarga, found across the region. Spirits based on anise are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean. The cooking of the area is not to be confused with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil, wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products. Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients, including meat, are dealt with in the kitchen, whether they are health-giving or not. Geography Potential distribution of the olive tree over the Mediterranean Basin (Oteros, 2014) Various authors have defined the scope of Mediterranean cooking either by geography or by its core ingredients. Elizabeth David, in her A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950), defines her scope as \\"the cooking of the Mediterranean shores\\" and sketches out the geographical limits: Despite this definition, David's book focuses largely on Spain, France, Italy, and Greece.Harry Eli Kashdan, \\"Anglophone cookbooks and the making of the Mediterranean, Food and Foodways 25:1:1-19, , p. 10 \\"Those blessed lands of sun and sea and olive trees\\": a landscape in Rhodes, in the Eastern Mediterranean She defines this region as coextensive with the range of the olive tree: \\"those blessed lands of sun and sea and olive trees\\". The olive's natural distribution is limited by frost and by availability of water. It is therefore constrained to a more or less narrow zone around the Mediterranean Sea, except in the Maghreb and in Spain, where it is distributed more widely, and on the islands of the Mediterranean, where it is widespread. The Tunisian historian Mohamed Yassine Essid similarly defines the region by the olive's presence, along with bread, wheat, and the grape as the \\"basic products of Mediterranean folk cuisine\\": Other authors question that there is any such common core: Some writers include the cuisines of the eastern Adriatic coast ‚Äì Albanian, Montenegrin, and Croatian, while most do not mention them. Some writers also include areas not touching the Mediterranean Sea or supporting olive cultivation, including Serbian, Macedonian, and Portuguese cuisine. Key ingredients Essid identifies the \\"trinity\\" of basic ingredients of traditional Mediterranean cuisine as the olive, wheat, and the grape, yielding oil, bread, and wine respectively. The archaeologist Colin Renfrew calls this the \\"Mediterranean triad\\". Olive Olive (Olea europaea) The olive appears to come from the region of Persia and Mesopotamia, at least 6,000 years ago. It spread from there to nearby areas, and has been cultivated since the early Bronze Age (up to 3,150 BC) in southern Turkey, the Levant, and Crete. The ten countries with the largest harvests (in 2011) are all near the Mediterranean (Portugal being the tenth largest): together, they produce 95% of the world's olives.FAOSTAT , 2011 The olive yields bitter fruits, made edible by curing and fermentation, and olive oil. Some 90% of the fruit production (1996) goes into olive oil. The Mediterranean region accounts for the world's highest consumption of olive oil: in 2014, the highest-consuming country, Greece, used 17 kg per head; Italy, 12 kg, Spain, 13 kg; the United States for comparison used only 1 kg per head. Wheat Wheat (Triticum) Wheat was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, in and near the Levant some 10,000 years ago. Its ancestors include wild emmer wheat; this was hybridised, harvested and sown to create domestic strains with larger grains, in ears that shatter less readily than wild forms. It was spread across the Mediterranean region as far as Spain by 5,000 BC. Wheat is a staple food in the Mediterranean region. Wheat bread was already critically important in the empire of Ancient Rome, which included the entire region; at that time, around 2,000 years ago, North Africa was the \\"breadbasket\\" of the empire.Essid, 2012, p.51 and passim Other staple wheat- based Mediterranean foods include pasta and semolina (wheat middlings) products such as couscous and bulgur. In turn, these are made into dishes such as the Greek dessert galaktoboureko (milk b√∂rek), consisting of filo pastry parcels around a custard made with semolina. A widespread wheat dish from Turkey and the Levant to Iran and India is halva, a dessert of sweetened semolina with butter, milk, and pine kernels. Grape Grape (Vitis vinifera) The grape was domesticated between 7,000 and 4,000 BC between the Black Sea and Persia; archaeological evidence shows that wine was being made there by 6,000 BC, reaching Greece and Crete in the fifth millennium BC and Spain by the last millennium BC. Winemaking started in Italy in the ninth century BC, and in France around 600 BC. More detail is given in Grapes are mostly grown for making wine and vinegar as basic components of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as raisins or for eating as table grapes. Raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour. Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area, with Southern Europe accounting for 21% of the world's harvest. In 2014, Italy produced 6.9 million tonnes (mt) of grapes, Spain 6.2 mt, France 6.2 mt, Turkey 4.2 mt, and Germany 1.2 mt. Wine production for Southern Europe was 37% of the world total in 2014, with Italy producing 4.8 mt, Spain 4.6 mt, France 4.3 mt, and Germany 0.9 mt. History=Concept A dish of roast aubergines and peppers (often called by its Proven√ßal name, ratatouille, in English), as interpreted on the Aeolian Islands. The concept of a Mediterranean cuisine is very recent, probably dating from the publication of David's A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950). David herself did not use the term, speaking instead of Mediterranean \\"food\\", \\"cookery\\", or \\"cooking\\".David, 1950, whole book The usefulness of the concept is disputed. Carol Helstosky, author of the book Food Culture in the Mediterranean (2009), is among the authors who use \\"Mediterranean cuisine\\" interchangeably with \\"Mediterranean food\\". In the preface to her book she writes Essid acknowledges that \\"geographical differences and the vicissitudes of history\\" have affected the food of different Mediterranean lands, but nonetheless asserts that: One of several Mediterranean cuisines: Spanish kitchen still life (Bodeg√≥n de cocina) by Cristoforo Munari, c. 1710 On the other hand, Sami Zubaida argues in his book Culinary Cultures of the Middle East (1994) that: The cookery author Clifford A. Wright wrote in 1999: \\"There really is no such thing as 'Mediterranean cuisine'. At the same time, we seem to know what we mean when we use the expression ...\\" Wright argued that David's book itself was largely about specifically French Mediterranean food, pointing out that \\"only 4 percent of her recipes come from North Africa or the Levant\\".Wright, 1999, Introduction, note 2: \\"it really is not about Mediterranean food but rather about French food\\". Since David's time, a variety of books on Mediterranean cuisine have been written, including Abu Shihab's 2012 and J. R. Stevens' 2015 books of that name; Helstosky's 2009 book; books by other cookery writers include S. Rowe's Purple Citrus and Sweet Perfume: Cuisine of the Eastern Mediterranean (2011); and Mari-Pierre Moine's Mediterranean Cookbook (2014). There are many more cookbooks covering specific cuisines in the Mediterranean area, such as B. Santich's The Original Mediterranean Cuisine: Medieval Recipes for Today (1995), on Catalan and Italian recipes; and H. F. Ullman's (2006) on the cooking of Tunisia, Spain and Italy, each one subtitled \\"Mediterranean Cuisine\\". Origins The haricot beans used in a Southern French cassoulet were brought to Europe from the Americas. The ingredients of Mediterranean cuisine are to an extent different from those of the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead of butter, wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries. One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus. Another major change was the arrival of foods from the Americas in Early Modern times (around the sixteenth century), notably the incorporation of the potato into Northern European cuisine, and the eager adoption of the tomato into Mediterranean cuisine. The tomato, so central now to that cuisine, was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544. Similarly, many of the species of Phaseolus beans now used around the Mediterranean, including P. vulgaris (the French or haricot bean), were brought back from the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers. Cooking Syrian apricot paste \\"dissolved in water to make a cooling drink\\" David's introduction to her 1950 book characterises the cooking of the Mediterranean countries as \\"conditioned naturally by variations in climate and soil and the relative industry or indolence of the inhabitants.\\" Certain foods are pan-Mediterranean, such as Bottarga, the salted, cured roe of fish such as the grey mullet. David identifies \\"the ever recurring elements\\" in the food of this extensive region as olive oil, saffron, garlic, \\"pungent\\" local wines, as well as the \\"aromatic perfume\\" of herbs, especially rosemary, wild marjoram, and basil, and the bright colours of fresh foods in the markets, \\"pimentos, aubergines, tomatoes, olives, melons, figs\\" and \\"shiny fish, silver, vermilion, or tiger-striped\\". She includes cheeses of \\"sheep's or goat's milk\\", \\"figs from Smyrna on long strings\\" and \\"sheets of apricot paste which is dissolved in water to make a cooling drink.\\" The major culinary regions of the Mediterranean With common ingredients including the olive, wheat, and grape; a shared climate; and a long period for cultural exchange, it might be expected that a single, pan-Mediterranean cuisine would have developed. Certain items, such as olive oil, bread, wine, roast lamb or mutton (for example, Maghrebi m√©choui, Greek kleftiko and souvlaki, Turkish shish kebab), bottarga, and stews of meat with vegetables and tomato (such as Spanish andrajos, French , Italian ciambotta, Turkish buƒüu kebabƒ±), are indeed found all around the Mediterranean. Seafood including sea bream and squid is eaten, often in stews, stuffed, or fried, in Spanish, French, and Italian dishes. Despite this, however, the lands bordering the Mediterranean sea have distinct regional cuisines, from the Maghrebi, Levant and Ottoman to the Italian, French, and Spanish. Each of those, in turn, has national and provincial variations. Tagines slow-cooking on a Moroccan street Maghrebi Maghrebi cuisine includes the cuisines of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. One of the most characteristic dishes of the region is couscous, a steamed, small-grained wheat semolina, served with a stew. The dish is ancient, mentioned by the Medieval traveller Ibn Battuta, and found for example also in the Western Sicilian cuisine, especially in the province of Trapani, where it was re-introduced after 1600. One stew that may be served with couscous is the Moroccan tagine, a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly in a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins. Ful medames on an Egyptian street with bread and pickled vegetables Egyptian Egyptian cuisine has ancient roots, with evidence that, for example, cheese has been made in Egypt since at least 3,000 BC. Falafel are small fried croquettes of bean or chickpea flour, eaten across the Levant and the West, but originating in Egypt; they are claimed as theirs by Coptic Christians. Duqqa is a dip made of pounded herbs, hazelnuts and spices, eaten with bread. Kushari is a foreign-derived 19th century dish of rice, lentils and pasta, variously garnished; it began as food for the poor, but has become a national dish. Levantine Levantine tabbouleh Levantine cuisine is the cooking of the Levant (including the Middle Eastern Mediterranean coast, east of Egypt). Among the most distinctive foods of this cuisine are traditional small meze dishes such as tabbouleh, hummus, and baba ghanoush. Tabbouleh is a dish of bulgur cracked wheat with tomatoes, parsley, mint and onion, dressed with olive oil and lemon juice.Sami Zubaida, \\"National, Communal and Global Dimensions in Middle Eastern Food Cultures\\" in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East, London and New York, 1994 and 2000, , p. 35, 37; Claudia Roden, A Book of Middle Eastern Food, p. 86; Anissa Helou, Oxford Companion to Food, s.v. Lebanon and Syria; Maan Z. Madina, Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language, 1973, s.v. ÿ™ÿ®ŸÑOxford Companion to Food, s.v. tabbouleh Baba ghanoush, sometimes called \\"poor man's caviar\\", is a puree of aubergine with olive oil, often mixed with chopped onion, tomato, cumin, garlic, lemon juice, and parsley. The dish is popular across the whole of the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa. Ful medames, originally from Egypt and still a national dish there, consists of fava beans with oil and cumin; it is popular throughout the Levant. The dish may be ancient: dried beans of Neolithic age have been found near Nazareth. Ottoman Turkish b√∂rek, small flaky pastries Ottoman cuisine has given rise to the cuisines of modern Turkey, parts of the Balkans, Cyprus, and Greece. A distinctive element is the family of small flaky pastries called b√∂rek. These are popular and widespread across the Eastern Mediterranean region, and date as far back as ancient Roman times. B√∂rek are made of thin sheets of filo pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and sweet peppers. Another widespread and popular dish is moussaka, a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients: often minced meat and tomatoes, sometimes a layer of egg custard or b√©chamel sauce on top. In its Greek variant, well known outside the region, it includes layers of aubergine and minced meat with custard or b√©chamel sauce on top, but that version is a relatively recent innovation, introduced by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s. Greek Greek salad Greek cookery makes wide use of vegetables, olive oil, grains, fish, wine and meat (white and red, including lamb, poultry, rabbit and pork). Other important ingredients include olives, cheese, aubergine, courgette, lemon juice, vegetables, herbs, bread and yoghurt. Some more dishes that can be traced back to Ancient Greece are: lentil soup, fasolada, retsina (white or ros√© wine flavoured with pine resin) and pasteli (sesame seeds baked with honey); some to the Hellenistic and Roman periods include: loukaniko (dried pork sausage); and Byzantium: feta cheese, avgotaraho (bottarga) and paximadhia (rusk). Lakerda (pickled fish), mizithra cheese and desserts like diples, koulourakia, moustokouloura and melomakarono also date back to the Byzantine period, while the variety of different pitas probably dates back to ancient times. Much of Greek cuisine is part of the larger tradition of Ottoman cuisine, the names of the dishes revealing Arabic, Persian or Turkish roots: moussaka, tzatziki, yuvarlakia, keftes and so on. Many dishes' names probably entered the Greek vocabulary during Ottoman times, or earlier in contact with the Persians and the Arabs. However, some dishes may be pre- Ottoman, only taking Turkish names later; the historians of food John Ash and Andrew Dalby, for example, speculate that grape-leaf dolmadhes were made by the early Byzantine period, while Alan Davidson traces trahana to the ancient Greek tragos and skordalia to the ancient Athenian skorothalmi. Italian Italian dish of pasta with clams Mediterranean Italian cuisine includes much of Italy outside the north and the mountainous inland regions. It is a diverse cuisine, but among its best-known and most characteristic foods are risotto, pizza in Neapolitan and Sicilian styles, and pasta dishes such as spaghetti. Risotto is a dish made using Italian short-grain rice, which is both highly absorbent and resistant to turning into a pudding when cooked with stock and flavoured with onions and garlic, cooked in butter.David 1988, Introduction, pp.101‚Äì103 Anna Gosetti della Salda's book of Italian regional cookery lists 37 risotto recipes, 18 of them from the Veneto. Variations among Veneto risottos include additions of fish and white wine; chicken; eel; mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese; quails; small pieces of beef; courgettes (zucchini); clams; rag√π; beans; mussels; prawns; cuttlefish; and asparagus. Pizza with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese Pizza, or as David notes \\"pissaladina or pissaladi√®re\\" in Provence (the cuisines of Mediterranean France and Italy having something in common), is a piece of bread dough rolled out thin, with a topping which varies from place to place, but is generally much simpler than those in the English-speaking world. In Naples this is tomato, anchovies and buffalo mozzarella. In San Remo it is onions cooked in olive oil, with salted sardines. The Proven√ßal variety uses onions, black olives, and anchovies.David 1988, pp.45‚Äì46 Spaghetti dishes also vary. It may be eaten as David says \\"simply with olive oil and garlic\\", without cheese, or with a sauce of \\"very red and ripe peeled tomatoes\\", cooked briefly and flavoured with garlic and either basil or parsley. One Sicilian variant includes pieces of bacon, onions fried in fat, garlic, stoned olives, and anchovies, served with olive oil and grated Parmesan cheese.David 1988, pp.109‚Äì111 Marseille bouillabaisse, with the fish served separately after the soup French Mediterranean French cuisine includes the cooking styles of Provence, Occitania, and the island of Corsica. Distinctive dishes that make use of local ingredients include bouillabaisse and salade ni√ßoise. Bouillabaisse is a substantial dish from the French port of Marseille, capital of Provence. It is a stew for at least eight people, because it should contain many kinds of fish such as crayfish, gurnard, weever, John Dory, monkfish, conger eel, whiting, sea bass, and crab. These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs, namely onions, garlic, tomatoes, thyme, fennel, parsley, bay, and orange peel.David 1988, pp.66‚Äì68 Salade ni√ßoise is a colourful salad of tomatoes, tuna, hard-boiled eggs, Ni√ßoise olives, and anchovies, dressed with a vinaigrette. Spanish paella with red peppers and mussels Spanish Spain's varied Mediterranean cuisines includes the cooking of Andalusia, Murcia, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic islands. Paella is a characteristic Spanish dish, originally from Valencia, radiating early on to Catalonia and Murcia along Spain's Mediterranean coast.

Its cuisine too is partly Mediterranean, with the usual trio of bread, wine, and olive oil, but also partly Atlantic, with a tradition of fishing and many seafood dishes such as spicy seafood rice (arroz de Marisco), clams, squid (lulas grelhadas), and bacalhau, imported salted cod. There are, equally, many meat dishes, using chicken, pork, and rabbit. Other major ingredients are onions, garlic, bay leaves, paprika, cloves, and chorizo sausage. Portuguese vegetables include the tomatoes common in Mediterranean cuisine, but also kale, carrots, and broad beans. Sweet dishes include past√©is de nata, custard tarts with cinnamon. The Alentejo produces red wines. Anise spirits Anise spirits of the Mediterranean region Anise is used around the Mediterranean to flavour various traditional spirits, including: * French pastis and absinthe * Greek ouzo * Italian sambuca * Spanish an√≠sado * Balkan rakƒ± * Lebanese, Libyan, Syrian, Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian arak * Algerian anisette cristal Mediterranean diet and cuisine The Mediterranean diet, popularised in the 1970s, is inspired by the cuisine of parts of Greece and Italy in the early 1960s. The American Diabetes Association writes about \\"Mediterranean-Style Eating\\", mentioning \\"the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle ... of ... eating healthfully ... together among family and friends\\", and asserting that \\"Mediterranean cuisine is plant-based\\", citing the ingredients \\"whole grains, fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, beans, nuts, seeds, and olive oil\\", and stating that most foods \\"in a Mediterranean diet come from plants\\". Fast food, Turkish style: with increasing wealth, people around the Mediterranean are changing their diet towards more meat (here, fried chicken) and less vegetables. The 1984 Guida all'Italia gastronomica states that \\"around 1975, under the impulse of one of those new nutritional directives by which good cooking is too often influenced, the Americans discovered the so-called Mediterranean diet. The name even pleased Italian government officials, who made one modification: changing from diet‚Äîa word which has always seemed punitive and therefore unpleasant‚Äîto Mediterranean cuisine.\\" A changing cuisine Since David wrote about Mediterranean food in 1950, and indeed since dietary researchers showed in the 1950s that people around the Mediterranean had less coronary heart disease than the peoples of northern Europe, the traditional Mediterranean ways of life and of eating have changed. Increased wealth and busy lives have led people to eat more meat and less vegetables: their diet is becoming more northern European, with more convenience foods and with less of a preventive effect on cardiovascular disease.

It is less than long, and lies west of Visokoi Island. It was discovered in 1819 by a Russian expedition under Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, who named it for the third lieutenant on the expedition ship Vostok. Leskov is located to the west of the main island arc of the South Sandwich Islands, and is composed of andesitic rather than basaltic lava with its highest peak reaching . The subduction zone forming the South Sandwich Trench lies to the east of the island arc. The island is small and has only two named features, both named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1971. Bowsprit Point is the island's northeast point, named for its resemblance to a bowsprit, or prow of a ship.

Italy had wanted to seize the independent nation of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) as part of its Italian Empire and also avenge the 1896 Battle of Adwa, a humiliating defeat. The Pact offered to partition Abyssinia and thus partially achieve Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's goal of making the independent nation of Abyssinia into an Italian colony. The proposal ignited a firestorm of hostile reaction in Britain and France and never went into effect. Hoare lost his position. Background In 1935 the Abyssinian Crisis and Second Italo-Ethiopian War began. In the United Kingdom many people and the official opposition supported League of Nations sanctions against Fascist Italy, as did the Dominions. The government hoped that strong sanctions against Italy might discourage Nazi Germany from similar actions, and won the November general election with a pro-League platform. On 8 December 1935, British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare discussed with his French counterpart Pierre Laval (who was both Prime Minister and Foreign Minister) how to end the war. On 9 December British newspapers revealed leaked details of an agreement by the two men to give much of Ethiopia to Italy to end the war. The British Cabinet had not approved the preliminary plan, but decided to support it to not embarrass Hoare. Reaction=Britain The Pact was met with a wave of moral indignation in Britain. On 10 December the Opposition Labour Party claimed if the reports in the press of the contents of the Pact were true, the government contradicted the pro-League policy on which it had just won the 1935 election.Keith Middlemas and John Barnes, Baldwin. A Biography (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1969), pp. 887-889. The Conservatives dominated the government and cared little for opinion on the left. They paid attention, however, when attacks came from the right.Ernst L. Presseisen, \\"Foreign Policy and British Public Opinion: The Hoare-Laval Pact Of 1935,\\" World Affairs Quarterly (1958) 29#3 pp. 256-277. In an editorial titled ‚ÄòA Corridor for Camels‚Äô, The Times on 16 December denounced the Pact and said there never was \\"the slightest doubt that British public opinion would recommend them for approval by the League as a fair and reasonable basis of negotiations\\".The Times (16 December 1935), p. 15. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang, condemned the Pact in a letter to The Times, and many other bishops wrote directly to Stanley Baldwin to oppose it.Middlemas and Barnes, p. 890. Duff Cooper, the Secretary of State for War, later wrote: > But before the Duce had time to declare himself there arose a howl of > indignation from the people of Great Britain. During my experience of > politics I have never witnessed so devastating a wave of public opinion. > Even the easy-going constituents of the St. George's division were > profoundly moved. The post-bag was full and the letters I received were not > written by ignorant or emotional people but by responsible citizens who had > given sober thought to the matter.Duff Cooper, Old Men Forget (London: > Rupert Hart-Davis, 1953), pp. 192‚Äì193. The Conservative Chief Whip told Baldwin: \\"Our men won't stand for it\\".Middlemas and Barnes, p. 890. Sir Austen Chamberlain in a speech to the Conservative Foreign Affairs Committee condemned the Pact and said: \\"Gentlemen do not behave in such a way\\".Harold Macmillan, Winds of Change (London: Macmillan, 1966), pp. 446-447. Harold Nicolson later wrote that he had had sleepless nights worrying whether he could keep his seat.Macmillan, pp. 411-412. France When the Chamber of Deputies debated the Pact on 27 and 28 December, the Popular Front condemned it, with L√©on Blum telling Laval: \\"You have tried to give and to keep. You wanted to have your cake and eat it. You cancelled your words by your deeds and your deeds by your words. You have debased everything by fixing, intrigue and slickness.... Not sensitive enough to the importance of great moral issues, you have reduced everything to the level of your petty methods\\".Geoffrey Warner, Pierre Laval and the Eclipse of France (New York: Macmillan, 1969), p. 126. Yvon Delbos declared: \\"Your plan is dead and buried. From its failure, which is as total as possible, you could have ‚Äì but you have not ‚Äì drawn a personal conclusion. Two lessons emerge. The first is that you were in a dead end because you upset everyone without satisfying Italy. The second is that we must return to the spirit of the Covenant [of the League of Nations] by preserving agreement with the nations gathered at Geneva\\".Warner, p. 126. Paul Reynaud attacked the government for aiding Hitler by ruining the Anglo-French alliance.Warner, p. 126. On the motion of censure, the French government had a majority of 296 votes to 276, with 37 Radicals voting for the government.Warner, p. 127. Outcome The British government withdrew the plan, and Hoare resigned. In early 1936 Italy began a new, larger advance using poison gas, and entered Addis Ababa on 5 May 1936. Historiography A. J. P. Taylor argued that it was the event that \\"killed the League [of Nations]\\" and that the pact \\"was a perfectly sensible plan, in line with the League's previous acts of conciliation from Corfu to Manchuria\\" which would have \\"ended the war; satisfied Italy; and left Abyssinia with a more workable, national territory\\" but that the \\"common sense of the plan was, in the circumstances of the time, its vital defect\\".A. J. P. Taylor, The Origins of the Second World War (Penguin, 1991), p. 128. The military historian Correlli Barnett has argued that if Britain alienated Italy, Italy \\"would be a potential enemy astride England's main line of imperial communication at a time when she was already under threat from two existing potential enemies at opposite ends of the line [Germany and Japan]. If ‚Äì worse ‚Äì Italy were to fight in a future war as an ally of Germany or Japan, or both, the British would be forced to abandon the Mediterranean for the first time since 1798\\". Therefore, in Barnett's view, it was \\"highly dangerous nonsense to provoke Italy\\" due to Britain's military and naval weakness and that therefore the pact was a sensible option.Correlli Barnett, The Collapse of British Power (Pan, 2002), pp. 352-3 and p. 356.

It was the replacement for Going Live!, and took many of its features from it, such as phone-ins, games, comedy, competitions and the showing of cartoons. Once Live & Kicking had become established in series two, it reached its height in popularity during series four, when it was presented by Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston; their final edition won a BAFTA award. After this the programme's ratings dropped with the launch of SMTV Live on ITV and the show came to an end in 2001. History Live & Kicking was conceived as a replacement for Going Live!. It was first broadcast on 2 October 1993 at 9 am on BBC1. The original hosts were Andi Peters, Emma Forbes who had presented a cookery segment in Going Live!, and John Barrowman. For the second series, Barrowman was relegated to hosting the showbiz Electric Circus segment, leaving Peters and Forbes to become the main hosts. He left after one series of Electric Circus to concentrate on acting. Comedy duo Trevor and Simon and Peter Simon, in the Run the Risk segment, were also regulars who had featured on Going Live!. While the first series was not as popular as its predecessor, the second series was more successful. It was broadcast during the winter months, from September to April, with Fully Booked replacing it during the summer. New episodes of the Rugrats were shown. The series went out opposite ITV's What's Up Doc? but during its third series issues were raised by the ITC, and a number of people left including Don Austen and John Eccleston (Bro and Bro's puppeteers) who defected to Live & Kicking to star as a couple of leprechaun brothers Sage and Onion. Andi Peters decided to leave the programme in 1996, after being offered an executive role at LWT, where he also presented Saturday mid-morning music programme The Noise. Emma Forbes initially planned to continue, but during the programme's summer break she also decided to leave, after finding out she was pregnant. They were replaced by Zo√´ Ball and Jamie Theakston, who presented it for three years. According to the BBC, the show's popularity was at its peak during the 1996/1997 series when the show regularly had 2.5 million viewers. Around this time Mr. Blobby, played by Barry Killerby, also appeared on the series. After three years, Ball decided to move on due to a hectic schedule, and Theakston followed. The final episode hosted by Ball and Theakston later won the show a children's BAFTA award for Best Entertainment show in November 1999. The show returned in Autumn 1999 with new presenters Emma Ledden and Steve Wilson,. They only lasted for one series, because ratings dropped to 1.6 million during their tenure. At the same time rival SMTV Live on competitor channel ITV was relaunched to feature more comedic elements and its innuendo and features began to gain popularity. Fully Booked, the BBC's summer replacement, was also revamped and retitled as FBi, but ratings continued to drop. The following October, the programme was completely revamped, with a line-up of four: Ortis Deley, Katy Hill, Trey Farley and Sarah Cawood. Ratings continued to plummet, because of the continuing success of SMTV Live. In an unprecedented move, in March 2001 the BBC extended the series over the summer, like SMTV was broadcast, but announced it would end in the autumn. Hill was replaced by Heather Suttie as the show was moved to BBC Scotland on 21 April until 15 September 2001 when the final show aired. It was replaced by The Saturday Show, which continued to be broadcast all year round. Format Live & Kicking was a weekly magazine show broadcast every Saturday morning, normally from September to April and later all year for the final series, and it was aimed at young people. It featured music performances, \\"hot seat\\" questions for celebrity guests, phone- ins, games, comedy sketches, competitions, and television programmes and cartoons. It used the taglines \\"Miss it, miss out\\" and \\"The only way to start your weekend\\" on promotional adverts for the show. As well as the main presenters, there were regulars such as comedy duo Trevor and Simon, and later Ben, Gez and Rich from The Cheese Shop and SuperGirly. A segment in the first few series that was an adaptation of Going Live's Double Dare was Run the Risk, a game in which teams of children completed various obstacle courses and challenges. Gunge was often included to make the tasks harder. Run The Risk was later broadcast separately. From 1994 until 2000, there was a showbiz segment called the Electric Circus, which featured the latest films, music, computer games and gossip. It was first presented by John Barrowman after he stepped aside as a regular presenter, and was later hosted by a variety of people. The first series featured the computerised head of a cat named \\"Ratz\\" announcing links, but this was dropped after one series. It was replaced by human announcer Mitch Johnson, who, as well as providing commentary and links for each item, would interact with both the audience and the presenters too. From the second series, two puppet leprechauns, later named as Sage and Onion, became regulars. They were played by Don Austen and John Eccleston, and were designed and built by Darryl Worbey Studios. They performed comedy sketches throughout the morning, and often interacted with the people in the studio. Another comedy character who first appeared in the third series was Mr Blobby, who had previously appeared in Noel's House Party. Most regular features were dropped for the final series, when the show was revamped. A feature that stuck throughout was the jingle for the phone number, first 081 811 8181, then 0181 811 8181, then 0845 610 1515. As well as the television show, Live and Kicking launched a music CD, composed of the best music that artists had sung live on the programme. A video game called Live and Kicking: Showmaker was also created, where the user could combine elements of the show to create their own television production on a small scale. A monthly magazine was also produced, though sales of the magazine dropped significantly towards the end of Live & Kicking's production, reflecting its loss of viewers. For series five and six, there was a short version of the show that aired on Friday afternoons called L&K; Friday, but this was cancelled after two series. The regular Saturday presenters Jamie Theakston and Zoe Ball presented the first series, and Steve Wilson and Liz Fraser presented the second series. A 90-minute version of the show also aired on BBC Choice and was entitled L&K; Replay. In May 2000, two months before Wilson and Ledden officially resigned from Live & Kicking, the show was brought back for a one-off special during the summer break. It was to mix in with the BBC's Music Live and the show was titled as Music Live & Kicking with Wilson and Ledden returning to present along with future presenter Ortis Deley and special guest presenter Stephen Gately of Boyzone. This special was dedicated to a series of music performances (hence the title) and was the first edition to be broadcast in widescreen. One of the last features was L&K; Castaway, a spin-off of the BBC reality show Castaway 2000. Each week, six children would spend four days on a remote Scottish island, learning how to survive, among other skills. Points were earned through passing various tasks, and were lost if contestants entered the \\"Temptation Hut\\", which contained various modern electrical appliances. Overview Live & Kicking began on 2 October 1993 and saw the introduction of presenters Andi Peters, Emma Forbes and John Barrowman. Trev and Simon also joined them and provided the comedy for the show; both had also been on the former show Going Live! with Forbes. Two leprechaun puppets made their debut in 1995, both of which would later be named in a viewers' competition as 'Sage and Onion'. Both Mr Sage and Mr Onion were created by Darryl Worbey Studios and were operated by Don Austen and John Eccleston, had previously been the puppeteers of the wolves 'Bro & Bro' on ITV's What's Up Doc? The computer game for the 1995 series was called Snuffle the Truffles and involved viewers guiding a pig character around a pigpen eating truffles, whilst Trev and Simon invited two guests to review videos in the Video Galleon. The last show before the programme went on a summer break in 1996 saw Peters and Forbes leave the show. The programme returned in September 1996 with the introduction of new presenters Zo√´ Ball and Jamie Theakston, and an array of new features. Its return in 1997 saw the replacement of the white set with a new one that maintained the same shape and layout, but was curvier and larger. This coincided with the show moving into the larger Studio 6. This series also saw the introduction of Ben Ward, Richard Webb and Gerard Foster (known as Ben, Gez and Rich) of The Cheese Shop who took over the comedy from 'Trev and Simon'. The computer game for this series became Grabbit Rabbit which involved guiding 'Warren the Rabbit' down a course collecting carrots whilst dodging obstacles such as fences and bushes. Ball later said in an interview that Blake Harrison of The Inbetweeners had told her that he had once been a player on Grabbit Rabbit when he was younger. On September 1998 Live & Kicking began with the leprechaun Mr Onion being temporarily written out of the show after supposedly being swept down the plughole in the bath. This was done intentionally as puppeteer John Eccleston was in Australia filming for Farscape and would not be available. To compensate for Eccleston's absence, a new leprechaun puppet was added called 'Shamrock' (voiced by Rebecca Nagan of Rosie and Jim fame). On 3 October 1998, future Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe also appeared in the audience during The Hot Seat item where he proceeded to ask The Chuckle Brothers a question. The final edition before the programme went on a summer break also saw the departure of Ball and Theakston as hosts and featured them both in The Hot Seat being interviewed by Michael Parkinson about their time on the show. This episode later went on to win a Children's BAFTA in November 1999. Live & Kicking returned on September 1999 and saw the introduction of new presenters Steve Wilson and Emma Ledden. New features were added however unlike previous series, many of them failed to last and were continuously replaced. It also saw leprechaun Mr Onion return, however Shamrock remained meaning the show now had three leprechaun puppets. A new comedy duo called Supergirly were also introduced from January 2000 to fill the gap left by 'Ben, Gez and Rich' who had quit the show the previous series. Supergirly, which consisted of Louise McClatchy and Jai Simeone, (known as Lou and Jai) would feature in sketches throughout the morning as BBC make-up artists who were rude to the guests. October 2000 saw a number of major changes to the show. The set was entirely revamped with a new layout, new titles were added along with a new arrangement of the theme tune. Mr Blobby, The Leprechauns, Supergirly, Renoir and Mitch had also been removed from the show and unlike previous series, there were now four presenters instead of two: Katy Hill, Ortis Deley, Trey Farley and Sarah Cawood. The programme also saw the introduction of gunge based games.A new game was also introduced on the roof of BBC Television Centre called Sacrifice Your Family which Cawood hosted that put two families against each other in various games. From 21 April 2001, Live & Kicking began broadcasting from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley joined by Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The last show on 15 September 2001 saw many of the old features and presenters return, including leprechauns Mr Sage and Mr Onion, who acknowledged in the final few minutes of the show that they were the longest serving presenters of the show. The final edition ended with a montage of the series' best moments over a live performance of the Steps song \\"It's The Way You Make Me Feel\\". Demise and replacement The Ball and Theakston series are considered to be when Live & Kicking was at its peak in popularity. After their final series in 1999, they were replaced by new presenters Emma Ledden and Steve Wilson. Ledden and Wilson did not know each other at the start of the series, and so there was none of the interaction between them, as seen between Ball and Theakston. Additionally, SMTV Live which broadcast opposite on ITV was slowly becoming more popular, and gaining the audience the BBC was losing. After just one series, Ledden and Wilson's contracts were not renewed. Wilson later said that they were dropped just as they were starting to form a relationship, and that Ant & Dec, presenters of SMTV Live, had the edge over them as they had known each other much longer. Ledden had already been dropped when Wilson went through several meetings with the BBC. He decided it was better to leave after one good series, rather than do a second \\"lame\\" series, and went on to appear in rival SMTV Live's 100th show, in the Friends skit, 'Chums'. When Live & Kicking returned in October 2000, it was completely revamped, with brand new titles and a line-up of four presenters. However, this did nothing to increase viewing figures, and the chemistry between the presenters was even less apparent. It was decided not to end the show in April and replace it with a summer show, because the replacement FBi had lost even more viewers for the BBC. Live & Kicking continued until September after a move to Glasgow where the summer show had normally been filmed. Just before the move it was announced it would be the final series. The principal reason given for the decision was the increasing loss of viewers to SMTV Live, which had a similar format and was more successful. Live and Kicking was replaced by The Saturday Show, fronted by Dani Behr and Joe Mace, which was shown all year round until September 2003 when it began an Autumn-Spring/Summer loop with Dick and Dom in da Bungalow. Live & Kicking was featured in the BBC's It Started with Swap Shop programme in 2006, in which Noel Edmonds interviewed the first pair of presenters, Andi Peters and Emma Forbes, about their time on the show. Production For the first four series, Live & Kicking broadcast from TC 7 at BBC Television Centre however as of Series 5, it moved next door into TC 6 where it gained a larger set due to it being a larger studio. On 14 April 2001, the final show from TC 6 at BBC Television Centre was broadcast before the show moved to 'Studio A' in BBC Scotland the following week, which at the time, was based on Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow. It then remained there until the end of its run. Studio A at Queen Margaret Drive has since been demolished following the BBC's move to new studios at Pacific Quay in 2007. Property developer David Wilson Homes are currently in the process of building new homes called The Botanics on the site of the old Live & Kicking studio. Studios TC 6 and TC 7 at BBC Television Centre also suffered a similar fate in 2015 when they too were demolished in the restructure of the building. As such, none of the studios used by Live & Kicking exist anymore.  After Live & Kicking  On Friday 16 November 2001, two months after the show had finished, parts of the old Live & Kicking set from Series 8 were resurrected and reused as part of BBC Scotland's regional studio set for BBC Children in Need. In an attempt to disguise the set's former use, all traces of L&K; branding were removed and replaced with Children In Need logos and throughout the course of the evening, the old gunge tank, beanbag seating area and performance stage were reused one more time. In 2004, former presenters Katy Hill and Trey Farley, who had presented the show together in Series 8, went on to marry each other at a register office in Surrey before flying to Tuscany to seal their marriage. They later had two children together- a daughter called 'Kaya Skye' born in 2006 and a son called 'Akira' born in 2007. In 2009, Zo√´ Ball and Jamie Theakston who had presented the programme together between 1996 and 1999, were reunited to present a new game show for Channel 5 called Britain's Best Brain which ran from 28 October to 16 December 2009.

The subantarctic Auckland Islands group to the south of New Zealand, discovered in 1806, were named after him. Early life A member of the influential Eden family, Auckland was a younger son of Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet, of Windlestone Hall, County Durham, and Mary, daughter of William Davison. His brothers included Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland, Governor of Maryland, Sir John Eden, 4th Baronet and Morton Eden, 1st Baron Henley. He was educated at Durham School, Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, and was called to the bar, Middle Temple, in 1768. Career In 1771 Auckland published Principles of Penal Law, and soon became a recognized authority on commercial and economic questions. In 1772 he took up an appointment as Under- Secretary of State for the North, a post he held until 1778. He was Member of Parliament for Woodstock from 1774 to 1784 and served as a Lord of Trade from 1776 to 1782. In 1778 he carried an Act for the improvement of the treatment of prisoners, and accompanied the Earl of Carlisle as a commissioner to North America on an unsuccessful mission to bring an end to the American War of Independence. During the War, he was head of the British spies in Europe, his budget reaching ¬£200,000 by 1778. He probably oversaw a small group of intelligence collectors for Lord Suffolk. On his return in 1779 he published his widely-read Four Letters to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1780 Auckland became Chief Secretary for Ireland, which he remained until 1782, and was admitted to the Irish Privy Council in 1780. He represented Dungannon in the Irish House of Commons between 1781 and 1783 and was Joint Vice-Treasurer of Ireland between 1783 and 1784. While in Ireland he established the National Bank. Between 1784 and 1793 Auckland was Member of Parliament for Heytesbury. He was sworn of the British Privy Council in 1784 and served as Envoy to France from 1785 to 1787 (on a mission dealing with commerce); he was Ambassador to Spain between 1787 and 1789 and Ambassador to the Netherlands between 1789 and 1793. In 1789 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Auckland and in 1793 he retired from public service, receiving a pension of ¬£2300, and was further honoured when he was made Baron Auckland, of West Auckland in the County of Durham, in the Peerage of Great Britain. During his retirement in the country at Beckenham, he continued his friendship with William Pitt the Younger, his nearest neighbour at Holwood House, who at one time had thoughts of marrying his daughter (see below). With Pitt's sanction he published his Remarks on the Apparent Circumstances of the War in 1795, to prepare public opinion for a peace. He was later included in Pitt's government as Joint Postmaster General in 1798. He severely criticized Pitt's resignation in 1801, from which he had endeavoured to dissuade him, and retained office under Henry Addington. This terminated his friendship with Pitt, who excluded him from his administration in 1804 though he increased his pension. Auckland later served under Lord Grenville as President of the Board of Trade in the Ministry of All the Talents between 1806 and 1807.

Personal life Eden's daughter Eleanor Agnes, by John Hoppner In 1776, Lord Auckland married Eleanor Elliot, daughter of Sir Gilbert Elliot, 3rd Baronet and Agnes Dalrymple-Murray-Kynynmound (daughter and heiress of Hugh Dalrymple-Murray- Kynynmound). Eleanor was a sister of Gilbert Eliott, 1st Earl of Minto. They had six sons and eight daughters, including: * Hon. Eleanor Agnes Eden (1777‚Äì1851), who became the subject of intense public interest in 1797 when it was rumoured that she was about to marry the Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger; when the matter became public, however, Pitt denied that he had proposed to Eleanor, much to her father's fury.Hague, William William Pitt the Younger Harper Collins 2004 Instead, she married Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire in 1799, and Pitt never married. * Hon.

People may also make hand signs at the entertainer, such as the thumbs down sign. If spectators particularly dislike the performance they may also accompany booing by throwing objects (historically rotten fruits and vegetables) on stage. Players booed for their performance felt booing \\"spooked\\" or \\"bothered\\" them or their teammates, and that it \\"affected their performance\\". Nick Swisher stated \\"It hurts. Sometimes I‚Äôm a sensitive guy and some of the things people say, they get under your skin a little bit.\\" Ledley King stated, \\"It just frustrates me when the crowd boo England, who is that going to help? It just heaps more pressure on the players and gives us even less of a chance of scoring\\". However, the counterargument goes that the combination of booing and applause help keep the quality of public performance high, by emotionally rewarding the good and punishing the bad. Booing is not always a judgement of performance, but can be an expression of disapproval of a third party. Sometimes this is even encouraged, such as at The Game Awards 2015, when the audience booed in disapproval at the announcement that Konami legally barred Hideo Kojima from making an appearance. Host Geoff Keighley agreed with the sentiment, saying, \\"it‚Äôs disappointing and it‚Äôs inconceivable to me that an artist like Hideo would not be allowed to come here and celebrate with his peers and his fellow teammates.\\" Sports In sports, booing by fans is quite common. They may boo particularly-hated players on the opposing team, or any opposing player when there is an intense rivalry between the teams. Unsportsmanlike behavior is also booed, such as intentionally hitting home team batters in baseball or diving in association football or basketball (where it is a technical foul). Booing of referees or umpires after an unpopular ruling is also common. Booing of expelled players after receiving a second yellow card or a direct red card is also common for many reasons. In professional sports, one's own home team, players or coach may be booed due to a poor performance or season. Examples * Adam Goodes who played for the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League was repeatedly and loudly booed by opposition fans during the 2015 AFL season at most of the matches whenever he touched the ball. During a match against Carlton, during the AFL's annual Indigenous Round, after he kicked a goal, he celebrated the goal by provoking the Carlton fans by performing an Aboriginal war dance in which he mimed throwing a spear in their direction. Afterwards, Goodes claimed that the dance was based on the one he learned from the under-16s Indigenous team the Flying Boomerangs, and that it was intended as an expression of indigenous pride during Indigenous Round, not with the intention of offending and intimidating the crowd. The booing escalated after the war dance. * Brazilian motor racing driver Emerson Fittipaldi was booed when, after winning the 1993 Indianapolis 500, he chose to drink orange juice instead of the milk traditionally drunk by winners of the race. Fittipaldi had made the move in order to promote the Brazilian citrus industry. * During professional wrestling matches, most heels traditionally receive boos from the audience as the villain. The ability to infuriate audiences and draw \\"heat\\" (negative reactions such as boos and jeers) is considered an essential skill for heel performers. * NFL fans booed at the Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Texans players who are protesting for their social justice before coin toss in the NFL 2020 season. Politics In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, booing is officially not permitted; Erskine May states: \\"Members must not disturb a Member who is speaking by hissing, chanting, clapping, booing, exclamations or other interruption.\\"Brian Wheeler, Why are MPs banned from clapping?, BBC (May 28, 2015). Nevertheless, jeering and heckling are somewhat common during Prime Minister's Questions.Justin Parkinson, Is Prime Minister's Questions really getting worse?, BBC News (February 18, 2014). Popular culture Although rare, in the performing arts, opera remains one of the arts where booing remains, if not common, customary as merited. In orchestral music, booing is usually restricted to the premiere of a new work. Rarer still is for motion pictures to be booed at their openings, and this is usually confined to film festivals when the production team is present. In traditional British pantomime, \\"the villain will generally include some abuse of the audience to stimulate hissing and booing\\" while the fairy and other protagonists are cheered.Millie Taylor, British Pantomime Performance (Intellect Ltd 2007), pp. 127-28. Narrative The film The Princess Bride uses booing to show shame. Princess Buttercup dreams of her wedding with Humperdinck when an elderly woman interrupts: The book Dreams on Film: The Cinematic Struggle Between Art and Science says this scene might be better labeled \\"Buttercup Unconsciously Booing Herself\\".

The regiment was, in effect, the Indian equivalent of the Household Cavalry of the British Army. History The regiment was first formed in 1773 as the Governor's Troop of Mughals for the first Governor- General of India, Warren Hastings. It was composed of various contingents raised from various parts of India.Gaylor, etc 1992 The regiment saw extensive service. In 1801 the regiment took part in the Egyptian campaign that removed a French force that had invaded Egypt. In 1811 the regiment was involved in the campaign to seize Java in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) from the Dutch, which was successfully achieved (Java and other Dutch territories were not returned to the Dutch until 1816, after the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars). In 1824 the First Burmese War began and the regiment took part in that conflict, winning the battle honour \\"Ava\\". The regiment saw service in the Gwalior War of 1843, fighting at the Battle of Mahrajapore (29 December) that saw a British victory against the Mahrattas. The regiment saw extensive service in the First Sikh War in 1845. This war saw the most battle honours awarded to the regiment in a single campaign. It was involved in the first engagement of that conflict, at Mudki (Moodkee), where the regiment's commanding officer, Lieutenant Charles Digby Dawkins, was killed. The regiment took part in the subsequent battles of the war; at Ferozeshah, Aliwal, and the last battle of the war, Sobraon. It was also active during the Indian Mutiny of 1857. Transfer to the Crown In 1858, when the Earl Canning became the first Viceroy of India upon the transfer of Indian rule from the British East India Company to the British Crown, the regiment also became formally known as the Viceroy's Bodyguard. The subsequent recruitment and selection was from various elite regiments and units of the British Indian Army. In 1885, the Third Burmese War, the last war between the British and Burmese, began and the regiment participated. In 1893, William Riddell Birdwood (later World War I General and 1st Baron Birdwood) became the Master Adjutant of the regiment, seeing service in a number of North-West Frontier expeditions, with his home (regimental) base in Dehradun. World War I and II In the First World War, men of the regiment were deployed to the Middle East in the fight against the German allied Ottoman Empire, seeing service in Mesopotamia (now Iraq). In 1944, the regiment became a mechanised one, though retaining a ceremonial mounted squadron. The regiment subsequently re-roled as an airborne unit and joined the 44th Indian Airborne Division, being renamed the 44th Indian Airborne Division Reconnaissance Squadron (Governor General's Bodyguard) It would retain the name until sometime after the war, when it reverted to its former name. Independence In 1947, the Partition of India saw the country of Pakistan established and Muslim personnel from the regiment were transferred to the Pakistani Army to form the Governor General's Bodyguard, Pakistan. The rest of the regiment remained with the Indian Army as the President's Bodyguard upon India proclaiming itself a republic in 1950.

The center consists of several parts: The Atrium, The Garden Room, The Theater, The Red Room, Huntington Event Park, and The Arena. It currently houses the Ontario Hockey League's Saginaw Spirit. The facility has housed a number of hockey teams in the past, such as the Saginaw Lumber Kings and both the IHL and UHL incarnations of the Saginaw Gears. Exterior The Arena At The Dow Event Center has a capacity of 7,600 people for concerts (without the ice), and 5,500 for hockey games. The Theater at the Dow Event Center has a capacity of 2,276 people. Originally built in 1972 as part of an urban development program, the center is the only structure left. Most of the other buildings were razed in the 1980s due to many problems, including health risks, foreclosure and bankruptcy. For a time in the 1990s, the facility nearly faced foreclosure and bankruptcy due to lack of funds provided by the city. The facility underwent a series of renovations in early 2000s, mainly in hopes for a better facility to host their newly acquired hockey team. The naming rights of the facility were transferred in September 2004 to The Dow Chemical Company, headquartered in nearby Midland. The center was used two times during the summer of 2004 as a center for Republican political rallies in support for the re-election of U.S. President George W. Bush. Voters transferred the ownership from the City of Saginaw to Saginaw County on May 8, 2001. The city then closed the facility on June 30, 2001, and the county reopened it on July 1. The county then appointed SMG Worldwide to manage the facility, and started updating and renovating the building. The total cost of the renovations was tagged at $17 million, and they were completed in 2003. The center hosts many events, concerts, political rallies, and graduations. Trade shows also take place there; the complex has of space at Wendler Arena. It hosted the third WWF In Your House pay-per-view on September 24, 1995. Jehovah's Witnesses District Conventions are held annually at the Dow Event Center. Starting in mid-June, and ending in early July, three-day conventions held on every weekend in that time will occur. The Jehovah's Witnesses first started using the building in 2005, after rumors of demolition for the Pontiac Silverdome raised concern over where meetings would be held, as the Silverdome was the previous venue.

Note that the zeta function is defined only if the set of fixed points is finite for each n. This definition is formal in that the series does not always have a positive radius of convergence.

Analogues The Artin-Mazur zeta function is formally similar to the local zeta function, when a diffeomorphism on a compact manifold replaces the Frobenius mapping for an algebraic variety over a finite field.

He was a key figure in the development of the instrumental ensemble at the basilica of San Marco di Venezia (St. Mark). His detailed book on instrumental ornamentation has survived. It is a rich resource for research in contemporary performance practice.Arnold/Ferraccioli, Grove online Bassano was most responsible for the performance of the music of Giovanni Gabrieli, who would emerge as one of the most renowned members of the Venetian School.Selfridge-Field, 15 Life Giovanni was likely born in Venice around 1560 or 1561 in the parish of San Maurizio, the son of Santo Griti da Sebenico and Orsetta Bassano. Orsetta's father Jacomo Bassano was the only brother of the six sons of Jeronimo Bassano who did not move permanently to London from Venice around 1540 as part of a new recorder consort to King Henry VIII. Santo seems to have taken over his father-in-law's instrument- making business and adopted the surname of Bassano for himself. He was the probable inventor of bassanelli.Lasocki and Prior, 217, 251‚Äì56. Giovanni Bassano arrived as a young instrumental player at St. Mark's probably in 1576 at the age of 18. He quickly acquired a reputation as one of the finest instrumentalists in Venice. By 1585 he had published his first book, , which details how best to ornament passages when transcribing vocal music for instruments. In that same year he became a music teacher at the seminary associated with St. Mark's. In 1601, he took over the job from Girolamo Dalla Casa as head of the instrumental ensemble. He served in this post until his death in August 1617.Arnold, ii 254 In addition to directing the music at St. Mark's, Bassano directed several groups of , bands of wind players including bagpipes, recorders, shawms, flageolets, bassoons, and conceivably other instruments, which were used in other churches (such as San Rocco) or street festivals.Selfridge-Field, 14‚Äì16 Bassano was also a composer, though his music has been overshadowed by his renown as a performer and his associated performance treatise.Selfridge-Field, 74‚Äì76 He wrote motets and concerti ecclesiastici (sacred concertos) in the Venetian polychoral style; and he also wrote madrigals, canzonettas and some purely instrumental music. His canzonettas achieved some fame outside Italy: Thomas Morley knew them, printing them in London in 1597 in English translation.Kerman, 66 Some of Bassano's instrumental music is ingeniously contrapuntal, as though he were indulging a side of his personality that he was unable to display in his more ceremonial, homophonic compositions. His fantasias and ricercars are densely imitative and contain retrograde and retrograde inversions of motivic ideas, a rarity in counterpoint before the 20th century.Selfridge-Field, 64‚Äì65 The similarity of Bassano's motets to the early work of Heinrich Sch√ºtz, who studied in Venice with Gabrieli, suggests that the two may have known each other. Likely Sch√ºtz knew Bassano's music and was influenced by it.Arnold, 254 MediaPublished works *Fantasie a tre voci, per cantar et sonar con ogni sorte d'istromenti Venezia: Giacomo Vincenti & Riccardo Amadino, 1585.

While traditional smart card systems require the card to be swiped through or inserted into a reader, the Go-To card requires a passenger to tap it against the reading device. This reduces mechanical wear dramatically, and removes the need for readers to be hardened against the sometimes cold and wet climate of Minnesota. Ticket machines on Metro Transit's Blue Line were designed with the Go-To card in mind. Before this system was sent into full release, some Metro Transit employees and selected area riders were part of a test program, started in the latter half of 2004, using the cards as they go about their daily business. In November 2004 after five months of service, Metro Transit's general manager stated that the devices only achieved 20% reliability. Cubic said that the issues that were originally delaying introduction were software problems. Frequently, either the reader or the card did not properly detect when it has been used.

It was fought on August 12, 1399, between the Tatars, under Edigu and Temur Qutlugh, and the armies of Tokhtamysh and Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania. The battle ended in a decisive Tatar victory. Background In late 1380s the relationship between Tokhtamysh, Khan of the Golden Horde, and his former master, Timur, was growing tense. In 1395, after losing the Tokhtamysh‚ÄìTimur war, Tokhtamysh was dethroned by the party of Khan Temur Qutlugh and Emir Edigu, supported by Timur. Tokhtamysh escaped to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and asked Vytautas for assistance in retaking the Horde in exchange for surrendering his suzerainty over Ruthenian lands. This development was in harmony with Vytautas' ambitions to become ruler of all Ruthenian lands. A surviving iarlyk shows that Tokhtamysh had asked for Polish‚ÄìLithuanian assistance previously in 1393. Vytautas' expeditions Vytautas gathered a large army which included Lithuanians, Ruthenians, Poles, Moldavians, and Wallachians. To enlist support from the Teutonic Knights, Vytautas signed the Treaty of Salynas, surrendering Samogitia to the Knights. Vytautas's son-in-law, Vasily I of Moscow, formally a Tatar vassal, did not join the coalition. The joint forces organized three expeditions into Tatar territories, in 1397, 1398, and 1399. The first expedition reached the Black Sea and Crimea. Vytautas took several thousand captives without much opposition. Half of these captives were settled near Trakai and awarded privileges to practice their faith. Communities of their descendants, Lipka Tatars and Crimean Karaites (Karaims), survive to this day. In 1398, the army of Vytautas moved from the Dnieper River and attacked northern Crimea, reaching as far east as the River Don.Itinerarium Witolda, 85. In order to strengthen his position, Vytautas built a castle at the mouth of Dnieper. Inspired by their successes, Vytautas declared a \\"Crusade against the Tatars\\" and in May 1399 received blessing from Pope Boniface IX. The papal blessing for the crusade was an important political achievement for Lithuania, a country converted to Christianity only in 1387 and the subject of a hundred- year crusade. The campaign was organized from Kiev. In 1399, the army of Vytautas once again moved against the Horde along the Dnieper River. On August 5, his army met the Tatars at the Vorskla River just north of Poltava (almost same location as the Battle of Poltava of 1709). Battle Once the two armies met, Temur Qutlugh proposed a three-day ceasefire to allow both sides to prepare their forces. It was a trick to win time while Edigu's reinforcements arrived. Vytautas planned to build a great wagon-fort, to stop charging horsemen, and then to destroy them with cannons and artillery. Vytautas' army was well equipped, but smaller in number. However, Temur Qutlugh feigned a retreat (a tried and tested Tatar tactic) and Vytautas left his wagon fort to pursue him. Once Lithuanian forces were suitably far away from the wagon fort, the units of Edigu appeared from behind and surrounded the Lithuanian army. At this point Tokhtamysh decided the battle was lost and fled the battle with his men. The Tartars then used their own artillery to destroy the Lithuanian cavalry whilst simultaneously capturing the Lithuanians' wagon fort.Posilge, 230; Dlugosz, XII, 526-529; Rhode, Die Ostgrenze Polens, I, 357-359; Russia and the Tatar Yoke, 111-112. Aftermath Vytautas barely escaped alive, but many princes of his kin (including his cousins Demetrius I Starszy and Andrei of Polotsk) and allies (as for example, Stephen I of Moldavia and two of his brothers) died in the battle. It is estimated that some 50 princes fought under Vytautas' banners and about 20 of them were killed. The victorious Tatars besieged Kiev, but it paid a ransom. The Tatars pillaged as far west as Lutsk, in pursuit of Tokhtamysh, who spent the next seven or eight years in hiding and was assassinated in 1407 or 1408. Vytautas' defeat at the Vorskla effectively blocked Lithuanian expansion to southern Ruthenia. His state also lost access to the Black Sea as the Tatars reconquered the southern steppe all the way to the borders of Moldavia;Posilge, 216, 222 lands that was reclaimed by the Golden Horde until the Crimean Khanate broke away from its rule some forty-two years later. After the battle, Yury of Smolensk revolted against Lithuania and Smolensk was not recaptured for five years. Veliky Novgorod and Pskov also rebelled against Lithuanian rule, drawing Vytautas into a war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Vytautas was forced to abandon his plans to break the Union of Kreva and to ally himself once again with his cousin and King of Poland Jogaila. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union was reaffirmed in the Union of Vilnius and Radom. Vytautas also turned his plans from expansion southwards to east (against Moscow) and west (against the Teutonic Knights). It has been suggested that Vytautas learned the staged retreat tactic during the battle and successfully used it himself in the Battle of Grunwald (1410), an important defeat of the Teutonic Knights.

The film-out process is different depending on the regional standard of the master videotape in question ‚Äì NTSC, PAL, or SECAM ‚Äì or likewise on the several emerging region- independent formats of high definition video (HD video); thus each type is covered separately, taking into account regional film-out industries, methods and technical considerations. Film-out of live action video Many modern documentaries and low-budget films are shot on videotape or other digital video media, instead of film stock, and completed as digital video. Video production means substantially lower costs than 16 mm or 35 mm film production on all levels. Until recently, the relatively low cost of video ended when the issue of a theatrical presentation was raised, which required a print for film projection. With the growing presence of digital projection, this is becoming less of a factor. Standard definition (SD) video Film-out of standard- definition video ‚Äì or any source that has an incompatible frame rate ‚Äì is the up-conversion of video media to film for theatrical viewing. The video-to-film conversion process consists of two major steps: first, the conversion of video into digital \\"film frames\\" which are then stored on a computer or on HD videotape; and secondly, the printing of these digital \\"film frames\\" onto actual film. To understand these two steps, it is important to understand how video and film differ. Film (sound film, at least) has remained unchanged for almost a century and creates the illusion of moving images through the rapid projection of still images, \\"frames\\", upon a screen, typically 24 per second. Traditional interlaced SD video has no real frame rate, (though the term \\"frame\\" is applied to video, it has a different meaning). Instead, video consists of a very fast succession of horizontal lines that continually cascade down the television screen ‚Äì streaming top to bottom, before jumping back to the top and then streaming down to the bottom again, repeatedly, almost 60 alternating screen-fulls every second for NTSC, or exactly 50 such screen-fulls per second for PAL and SECAM. Since visual movement in video is infused in this continuous cascade of scans lines, there is no discrete image or real \\"frame\\" that can be identified at any one time. Therefore, when transferring video to film, it is necessary to \\"invent\\" individual film frames, 24 for every second of elapsed time. The bulk of the work done by a film-out company is this first step, creating film frames out of the stream of interlaced video. Each company employs its own (often proprietary) technology for turning interlaced video into high-resolution digital video files of 24 discrete images every second, called 24 progressive video or 24p. The technology must filter out all the visually unappealing artifacting that results from the inherent mismatch between video and film movement. Moreover, the conversion process usually requires human intervention at every edit point of a video program, so that each type of scene can be calibrated for maximum visual quality. The use of archival footage in video especially calls for extra attention. Step two, the scanning to film, is the rote part of the process. This is the mechanical step where lasers print each of the newly created frames of the 24p video, stored on computer files or HD videotape, onto rolls of film. Most companies that do film-out, do all the stages of the process themselves for a lump sum. The job includes converting interlaced video into 24p and often a color correction session ‚Äì (calibrating the image for theatrical projection), before scanning to physical film, (possibly followed by color correction of the film print made from the digital intermediary) ‚Äì is offered. At the very least, film-out can be understood as the process of converting interlaced video to 24p and then scanning it to film. =NTSC video= NTSC is the most challenging of the formats when it comes to standards conversion and, specifically, converting to film prints. NTSC runs at the approximate rate of 29.97 video \\"frames\\" (consisting of two interlaced screen-fulls of scan lines, called fields, per frame) per second. In this way, NTSC resolves actual live action movement at almost ‚Äì but not quite ‚Äì 60 alternating half-resolution images every second. Because of this 29.97 rate, no direct correlation to film frames at 24 frames per second can be achieved. NTSC is hardest to reconcile with film, thus motivates its own unique processes. =PAL and SECAM video= PAL and SECAM run at 25 interlaced video \\"frames\\" per second, which can be slowed down or frame- dropped, then deinterlaced, to correlate \\"frame\\" for frame with film running at 24 actual frames per second. PAL and SECAM are less complex and demanding than NTSC for film-out. PAL and SECAM conversions do agitate, though, with the unpleasant choice between slowing down video (and audio pitch, noticeably) by four percent, from 25 to 24 frames per second, in order to maintain a 1:1 frame match, slightly changing the rhythm and feel of the program; or maintaining original speed by periodically dropping frames, thereby creating jerkiness and possible loss of vital detail in fast-moving action or precise edits. High definition (HD) digital video High definition digital video can be shot at a variety of frame rates, including 29.97 interlaced (like NTSC) or progressive; or 25 interlaced (like PAL) or progressive; or even 24-progressive (just like film). HD, if shot in 24-progressive, scans nearly perfectly to film without the need of a frame or field conversion process. Other issues remain though, based on the different resolutions, color spaces, and compression schemes that exist in the high-definition video world. Film- out of computer graphics and animation Artists working with CGI-Computer- generated imagery animation computers create pictures frame by frame. Once the finished product is done, the frames are outputted, normally in a DPX file. These picture data files can then be put on to film using a film recorder for film out. SGI computers started the high-end CGI-Computer-generated imagery animation systems, but with faster computers and the growth of Linux-based systems, many others are on the market now. Movies fully rendered and animated in CGI such as Toy Story, and Antz utilize the film-out method to produce 35mm copies for archival and release prints. Most CGI work is done in 2K Display resolution files (about the size of QXGA) and then output to the Film-out device for creation of 35mm elements. With 4K Display resolution digital intermediates on the rise, newer types of film-out recorders are being developed to accept 4k resolution files. A 2K movie requires a Storage Area Network storage several terabytes in size to be properly stored and played out. Computer graphics files are handled the same way but in single frames and may use DPX, TIFF or other file formats. Film-out of digital intermediate Film-out-recording is the last step of digital intermediate work flow. DPX files that were scanned on a motion picture film scanner are stored on a storage area network (often abbreviated as \\"SAN\\"). The scanned DPX footage is edited and composited-FX on workstations, then mastered back on film. Film restoration is also done this way. Film-out of images for the graphic design and print industries The days of newspapers and magazines shooting 35mm film are almost gone. Digital cameras can now shoot all the images needed, storing them as files (e.g. JPEG, DPX or another format) that are readily edited prior to use. Once the final copy is approved, it can be filmed out for publishing. Digital stills are not the only way to get pictures used in the graphic design and print industries. Film scanners and computer graphics programs are also common sources for graphic design and print industries. Types of Film Out Devices *CRT recorder. Camera and a special TV display **Kinescope ‚Äì early type *Electronic Video Recording or EVR ‚Äì early type *EBR Electron Beam Film Recorder 16 mm by 3M * Laser film recorder, like Kodak's high-end Lightning II recorder and Arri's Arrilaser. * DLP Film recorder, like Cinevation's real- time Cinevator. History Lately it has become possible to transfer video images, including films scanned at high resolution, back to film stocks by making a digital intermediate, which can then be recorded out to fine-grain film intermediate with a laser film printer. The first major live-action film to use this process entirely was O Brother Where Art Thou, done by Kodak's Cinesite division in Hollywood in the spring of 2000. Prior to this, the video master was transferred from tape to film through one of several methods: CRT recorder, laser film printer, Kinescope, or electron beam recorder (EBR). Theater performances have been preserved with Kinescope for many years ‚Äì the 1964 New York production of Hamlet with Richard Burton, for example, was shot on video and printed as a film that was released in movie theaters using this process. Fernando Arrabal was the first to use the technique of video-to-film for aesthetic purposes, for the 1971 film Viva la muerte, which used heavily color-adjusted video footage only for the fantasy sequences.arrabal.org's compilation of reviews of the film Viva la muerte. Experimental filmmaker Scott Bartlett also utilized video footage and effects for portions of his 1972 film OffOn, by filming such with a 16 mm film camera off of a video monitor. Technicolor also experimented in the early 1970s with using video gear & videotape to make feature-length motion pictures with, by transferring the videotape to film for final release and distribution. Films made with this process were the 1973 film Why, the 1971 film The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler, and the most famous film using this process, Frank Zappa's 1971 film 200 Motels, which was originally shot on 2 inch Quadruplex videotape, and then transferred to film by Technicolor, being the first independent film originally to be shot on videotape and distributed theatrically in 35 mm. Also, countless educational, medical, industrial, and promotional videotapes produced from the late 1950s up to the mid-1980s were also transferred to film stock (usually 16 mm film) for widespread distribution, using either an EBR or CRT recorder. This was done due to VCRs and VTRs then not being commonplace in most schools, hospitals, boardrooms, and other institutional settings, due to their high cost and the multitudes of proprietary (and incompatible) open- reel, cartridge, & cassette videotape formats in the early years of industrial-market videotape recorders starting in the mid-to-late 1960s. But 16 mm projectors were widely available at the time in such settings, making distribution of such video productions on 16 mm film more practical. One company that specialized in the transfer of videotape-originated programming to 16mm film in the 1970s and 1980s was Image Transform, a company that specialized in and developed its own technologies for video-to-film transfer. Such transfers were the case until the mid-1980s, when the VCR became affordable enough (and much more standardized in the form of VHS and Betamax) to be adopted in such institutional settings on a widespread basis. Digital video equipment has made this approach easier; theatrical-release documentaries and features originated on video are now being produced this way. High Definition video became popular in the early 2000s by pioneering filmmakers like George Lucas and Robert Rodriguez, who used HD video cameras (such as the Sony HDW-F900) to capture images for popular movies like Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones and Spy Kids 2, respectively, both released in 2002. Independent filmmakers, especially those participating in the Dogme movement of filmmaking, have also shot their films on MiniDV videotape, to be transferred to 35 mm film stock for theatrical release. Some examples of independent movies being shot on videotape are Lone Scherfig's Italian For Beginners (a Dogme film), Steven Soderbergh's Full Frontal (which was shot on PAL-standard MiniDV gear in the normally NTSC-prevalent US, due to its higher resolution of 625 lines and frame rate of 25 frame/s (as opposed to NTSC's 525 line resolution and 30 frame/s frame rate), more closely matching film's 24 frame/s), and Mike Figgis' Timecode. Initially due to budgetary concerns, Filmmaker Rob Nilsson shot his feature drama \\"Signal 7\\" in 1984 using Sony portable U-matic format videocassette decks paired with Ikegami HL-79 3-tube broadcast video cameras (a setup comparable to ENG systems used by broadcast television stations at the time). The video hardware & taped footage took the place of the traditional cinema camera and it's negatives, which were edited in post-production and transferred to 35mm film for theatrical release & exhibition. Nilsson liked the visual look of video-to- film transfer, and shot several other of his films the same way. Arrilaser film recorders are also used for film-out.

It is part of the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, also claimed by Argentina as part of Tierra del Fuego province. History It was discovered in 1775 by a British expedition under James Cook, who so named it \\"on account of the vast numbers [of birds] that were upon it\\". In the late 1950s, the island was the subject of a number of US-funded projects. Between 1959‚Äì62, a great number of the island's wandering albatross were ringed, which gave startling data about their range - one bird was found in Australia . The island is currently a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and so there are no landings allowed without permission. The summit of the island, Roch√© Peak is named after the Englishman Anthony de la Roch√© who discovered South Georgia in 1675. 2008 marked the 50th anniversary of biological research on Bird Island. Research Station The island has been a station for Antarctic research since 1963 and is currently a biological research station of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) at Jordan Cove, with three resident biologists and one technician. The main focus of the research is the ecology and population of the island's seabirds and seals. While the British Magistrate and other civilians and military present in Grytviken were removed from South Georgia during the Argentine occupation of South Georgia in 1982, another 15 Britons remained beyond Argentine reach. The losses suffered at Grytviken prevented Argentina from occupying the rest of the island, with Bird Island Station, and field camps at Schlieper Bay, Lyell Glacier and St. Andrews Bay remaining under British control. Wildlife The island is home to: * 65,000 Antarctic fur seals (around 1 for every of the island) * 50,000 macaroni penguins * 15,000 pairs of black-browed albatross * 12,000 pairs of grey-headed albatross * 1700 pairs of wandering albatross * 500 pairs of southern giant petrels (10% of South Georgia's total) This is in addition to several hundred thousand other birds, including gentoo penguins, South Georgia pintails and South Georgia pipits. Of South Georgia's 31 breeding species, 27 are found here. Cetaceans such as southern right whales can be seen on their feeding season in Subantarctic regions. The island has always been rat-free, unlike the main island of South Georgia where introduced rats were eradicated between 2010 and 2015.

An inversion occurs when a single chromosome undergoes breakage and rearrangement within itself. Inversions are of two types: paracentric and pericentric. Paracentric inversions do not include the centromere and both breaks occur in one arm of the chromosome. Pericentric inversions include the centromere and there is a break point in each arm. Cytogenetic techniques may be able to detect inversions, or inversions may be inferred from genetic analysis. Nevertheless, in most species small inversions go undetected. In insects with polytene chromosomes, for example Drosophila, preparations of larval salivary gland chromosomes allow inversions to be seen when they are heterozygous. This useful characteristic of polytene chromosomes was first advertised by Theophilus Shickel Painter in 1933. Inversions usually do not cause any abnormalities in carriers as long as the rearrangement is balanced with no extra or missing DNA. However, in individuals which are heterozygous for an inversion, there is an increased production of abnormal chromatids (this occurs when crossing-over occurs within the span of the inversion). This leads to lowered fertility due to production of unbalanced gametes. An inversion does not involve a loss of genetic information, but simply rearranges the linear gene sequence. Families that may be carriers of inversions may be offered genetic counseling and genetic testing. In species of Drosophila subobscura, researchers have been able to track global climate change by measuring the magnitude and directional shift in chromosome inversion frequencies, relative to temperatures in specific global sites. An example of Chromosomal Inversion in organisms is demonstrated in the insect, Coelopa frigida. This particular species of Coelopa have a variation of Chromosomal inversions that allow the species to create a series of physical differences. Individual C. frigida that are larger do not undergo a chromosomal inversion, whereas individuals that are smaller do undergo a chromosomal inversion.

Geography  The island is long and wide, capped by Mount Hodson, a volcanic peak (). The peak is named after Sir Arnold Weinholt Hodson, a governor of the Falkland Islands. The island has a strong smell of sulphurous fumes. The island is surrounded by an underwater shelf that extends out approximately , at a depth of approximately . Finger Point marks the island's northern tip. It was named descriptively by DI in 1930. Wordie Point is the south-west point of the island. DI personnel named it for Scottish geologist and polar explorer James Wordie. north of it is Sulphur Point, whose reddish ground is streaked with sulphur. Originally called West Bluff by DI personnel, it was renamed by UK-APC to avoid confusion with West Bluff on nearby Zavodovski Island. Irving Point, first discovered by von Bellingshausen's expedition, forms the eastern extremity of the island. DI personnel named it \\"Penguin Point,\\" but UK-APC changed it to avoid redundancy with other similarly-named locations. Irving Point was chosen for Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander J. Irving, who sketched the South Sandwich Islands from the Discovery II. northwest of Irving Point lies Saddle Bluff, named by DI personnel. Nearby Shamrock Hill, a prominent volcanic cone, was named by the survey party from because they occupied this feature as a survey station on Saint Patrick's Day, 1964. Mikhaylov Point is a small promontory marking the island's southern extremity. It was named \\"Low Point\\" by DI personnel, but the name was changed by UK-APC to avoid duplication with Low Point on nearby Vindication Island. The name \\"Mikhaylov Point\\" was recommended for Pavel N. Mikhaylov, artist aboard the Vostok during the Russian expedition under von Bellingshausen.

Religion  Most of the Slavic population were Christians. The local Tungusic peoples followed local religions; some Ashkenazi Jews practiced Judaism.  Hydrography  It would have had a coastline similar to that of the Far Eastern Republic.  History of settlement  The Zeleny Klyn (), Zelena Ukraina or Eastern Ukraina was an area of land settled by Ukrainians which is a part of the Russian Far East in the area of the Amur River and the Pacific Ocean. It was named by the Ukrainian settlers. The territory consists of over 1,000,000 square kilometres and has a population of 3.1 million (1958). The Ukrainian population in 1897 made up 15% of the Primorskaya Oblast's population. Zeleny Klyn became part of the Russian Empire much later than Siberia and other parts of the Far East. The first attempts at colonizing the area date back to the mid-17th century when Yerofey Khabarov founded the fort of Albazin on the Amur River. From that time, constant skirmishes took place with the Manchu people of China. In 1689 China and Russia signed the Treaty of Nerchinsk, which granted Russia limited territory. Number and share of Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the RSFSR (1926 census) In the mid 19th century, the second Russian expansion took place after Russia lost the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856). A number of Cossack settlements were established on the Amur river. China had become far weaker than Russia at the time and ceded territory to Russia in the Treaty of Aigun of 1858 and by the Convention of Peking of 1860 (see Amur Annexation). During this period only a small number of settlers settled in the region consisting of some 14,000 Cossacks and 2,500 Russian soldiers. In 1861 two oblasts were established, the Primorsky and Amur. Vladivostok was founded in 1860, Khabarovsk in 1858. In 1882 free transportation was announced for settlers to the area from Ukraine and free land was offered to settlers. By 1897 the population had increased to 310,000. With the establishment of the railroad in 1901 over 14,000 settlers were moving to the area per year, with a maximum of 78,000 settlers moving there in 1907. After 1917 the area came under the jurisdiction of Admiral Alexander Kolchak. In 1920 the Far East Republic was established as a buffer republic between Russia and Japan. In 1922 the republic joined with the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In 1934 the Jewish Autonomous Oblast region was established with its capital at Birobidzhan.

It also provides the Maryland Department of Transportation with financing for other revenue producing transportation projects. Agency structure alt=William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial (Bay) Bridge The MDTA was established in 1971 to take over functions previously performed by the former State Roads Commission. Financially independent from Maryland's general fund and transportation trust fund, the Authority operates as a purely enterprise agency, providing services on a user charge basis similar to the operation of a commercial enterprise. Its capital projects and operations are funded by tolls, concessions, investment income, and revenue bonds.2010 Strategic Plan, p. 5 In addition to its own toll facilities, the Authority finances construction of other revenue-producing transportation facilities for the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). These projects have included improvements at the Port of Baltimore and the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. To provide construction funding, the Authority issues revenue bonds, which will be paid off over a period of years by tolls and other user fees generated by the facilities. The MDTA can issue either taxable or exempt bonds to finance large scale projects. As of June 30, 2010, the Authority had outstanding revenue bonds totaling $2.7 billion. Most of this debt was in the form of transportation facility revenue bonds valued at $1.6 billion, for MDTA toll facilities. Grant and Revenue Anticipation (GARVEE) bonds, secured by federal grants and revenue pledged from individual projects, comprised $651 million of the debt. Conduit revenue bonds, for the construction of transportation parking and airport passenger facilities, also secured by federal grants and the future revenue of specific facilities, comprised the rest of the debt. Unlike the transportation facility bonds, the conduit and GARVEE bonds are pledged to revenue sources managed by other agencies, external to the MDTA.Annual Report 2010, pp 6-7. Governing board alt=Gov. Harry W. Nice Memorial BridgeThe Maryland Secretary of Transportation serves as chairperson of the Authority's governing board. Eight other board members are appointed to four year terms by the Governor, with confirmation by the Maryland Senate. Term expirations are staggered. Board members can be reappointed to additional terms, but a limit of three consecutive terms was established in 2007. Daily operations of the Authority are overseen by the Executive Director who serves as the chief executive officer for the agency and is hired by the MDTA Board. Members of the board are: * Gregory I. Slater, Maryland Transportation Secretary, Chairman * Dontae Carroll * William H. Cox, Jr. * William C. Ensor III * W. Lee Gaines, Jr. * Mario J. Gangemi, P.E. * John F. von Paris * Cynthia D. Penny-Ardinger * Jeffrey S. Rosen I-95 Express Toll Lanes (ETL)The chairman is always the Maryland Secretary of Transportation. The chair has an absolute veto on all decisions, that is, no policy can be adopted or action carried out without the \\"concurrence\\" of the chair. However, it seems this is rarely needed; meeting minutes show the board usually votes unanimously. The Capital Committee members include Ensor III, Cox, Jr., Gangemi and Gaines, Jr. The Finance Committee members are Penny-Ardinger, Carroll, Rosen and Von Paris. There are other standing committees which do not hold public meetings: Human Resources and Audit. Their status as \\"public bodies\\" under state law is uncertain.Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge The MDTA Board and its two active standing committees (Capital Committee and Finance Committee) have been found in violation of the Maryland Open Meetings Act a number of times between 2009 and 2012. In response to one of the complaints, the MDTA began notifying the public of Finance and Capital committee meetings; allowing the public to attend them; and began putting meeting schedules and minutes of the two committees and the Board online. The MDTA maintains tape recordings of meetings at its offices on Broening Highway, Baltimore. Meeting audio or video is not available through their website. MDTA Police The Maryland Transportation Authority Police were established in 1971 as part of the MDTA. Their mission is protection of the Authority's facilities as well as several other transportation facilities including the Port of Baltimore and BWI Airport. Facilities alt=Fort McHenry Tunnel Baltimore Harbor Tunnel Francis Scott Key Bridge Toll facilities The MDTA operates eight toll facilities: *Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 40 across the Susquehanna River between Harford and Cecil counties *William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge (Chesapeake Bay Bridge), which carries U.S. Routes 50/301 across the Chesapeake Bay between Anne Arundel and Queen Anne's counties *Francis Scott Key Bridge, which represents the outer crossing of the Baltimore Harbor, by I-695, the Baltimore Beltway *Governor Harry W.

Kennedy Memorial Highway, the section of I-95 that traverses northeastern Maryland from the Baltimore city line to the Delaware state line *Fort McHenry Tunnel, which carries I-95 under the Baltimore Harbor *Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, which carries I-895 under the Baltimore Harbor *Maryland Route 200, the Intercounty Connector Although the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway is referred to as a toll road, tolls are only collected at a single point, a toll plaza located a mile north of the Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge over the Susquehanna River, on the northbound side. Vehicles which do not traverse this section, and all southbound vehicles, do not pay a toll. In September 2017, Governor Larry Hogan announced a plan to widen the Baltimore-Washington Parkway by four lanes, adding express toll lanes to the median, as part of a $9 billion proposal to widen roads in Maryland. The project would be a public-private partnership with private companies responsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the lanes. As part of the proposal, the portion of the parkway owned by the National Park Service would be transferred to the Maryland Transportation Authority. Intercounty Connector Maryland Route 200, the Intercounty Connector (ICC), links existing and proposed development areas of Montgomery County and Prince George's County between Interstate 370 at Shady Grove and Interstate 95 in Laurel with an east-west limited-access highway. The $2.4 billion project is being financed by MDTA, with the Maryland State Highway Administration serving as the project manager for engineering and construction. Tydings Bridge When the first segment of the ICC opened on February 23, 2011, it became the first toll facility in Maryland with fully automated toll collection. Connecting Interstate 370 with Maryland Route 97, the first segment is long. Express toll lanes The MDTA began construction of the I-95 express toll lanes on a congested portion of Interstate 95, north of Downtown Baltimore, in May 2005. Now completed, the new toll system extends for , from the east side of Baltimore City, at the I-895 split, into Baltimore County, north of Maryland Route 43 in White Marsh. This segment of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway (Interstate 95) has two Express Toll and four general purpose lanes in each direction. Tolls for using the Express Toll lanes vary, depending on traffic conditions, to reduce congestion. The general purpose lanes continue to operate toll-free. Other facilities The MDTA has owned the Canton Railroad, which operates as a for- profit enterprise, since 1987. Toll increases A two-part toll increase became effective at all Maryland toll facilities on October 1, 2011 and July 1, 2013. The toll increase was proposed by the Authority's board on June 2, 2011. The changes were expected to raise an additional $77 million during the first fiscal year after their implementation. Additional revenue was considered necessary by the board to expand highway capacity and rehabilitate aging infrastructure. The previous toll increase was in 2009, but only affected vehicles with three or more axles. The previous increase for passenger vehicles was in 2003.

Discovery and observation Kordylewski began looking for a photometrically confirmable concentration of dust at the libration (Lagrangian) points in 1951. After a change in method suggested by Josef Witkowski, the clouds were first seen by Kordylewski in 1956.

In October 2018, the existence of the Kordylewski clouds was reported to have been confirmed, even though, earlier, in 1992, the Japanese Hiten space probe, which passed through the Lagrange points to detect trapped dust particles, did not find an obvious increase in dust levels above the density in surrounding space. Appearance The Kordylewski clouds are a very faint phenomenon, comparable to the brightness of the gegenschein. They are very difficult to observe from Earth but may be visible to the unaided eye in an exceptionally dark and clear night sky. Most claimed observations have been made from deserts, at sea, or from mountains. The clouds appear somewhat redder than the gegenschein, indicating that they may be made of a different kind of particle. The Kordylewski clouds are located near the and Lagrange points of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system. They are about 6 degrees in angular diameter. The clouds can drift up to 6 to 10 degrees from those points.

Phototrophy takes place at the cell membrane, which does not form folds or compartments as it does in purple bacteria. Though heliobacteria are phototrophic, they can grow without light by fermentation of pyruvate. RNA trees place the heliobacteria among the Firmicutes, but they do not stain Gram-positively. They have no outer membrane and like certain other firmicutes (Clostridia), they form heat-resistant endospores, which contain high levels of calcium and dipicolinic acid. Heliobacteria are the only firmicutes known to be phototrophic. Heliobacteria are photoheterotrophic, requiring organic carbon sources, and they are exclusively anaerobic. Bacteriochlorophyll g is inactivated by the presence of oxygen, making them obligate anaerobes (they cannot survive in aerobic conditions). Heliobacteria have been found in soils, hot springs, soda lakes and are apparently widespread in the waterlogged soils of paddy fields. They are avid nitrogen fixers, so are probably important in the fertility of paddy fields.

A couple of years later, he traded a worn-out Beatles disc for a new album by The Rolling Stones and plunged deeper into the jungle of rock music. In San Diego, he began playing in the groups Funky Demon, Pagan Tumor, Boilerhouse, Redemption, and Search. He joined the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers in December 1983, after the original guitar player Hillel Slovak left the band. Sherman would remain with the band for their first tour in 1984 to support the release of their first album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers. This turned out to be the only album on which he would act as guitarist. In early March 1984, the group with Jack Sherman filmed their debut television appearance on Thicke of the Night hosted by Alan Thicke. This aired on March 16, 1984, where the group energetically performed a new composition ‚ÄúTrue Men Don‚Äôt Kill Coyotes‚Äù, and the already proven concert number ‚ÄúGet Up and Jump‚Äù. Jack Sherman played all the shows with The Red Hot Chili Peppers from January 1984 to February 1985. The first show with Jack was on January 19, 1984 at the Music Machine. The last show was on February 16, 1985 at Jed‚Äôs Showcase. Sherman would co-write half of the songs on the band's second album, Freaky Styley, but when Slovak requested to return to the band in early 1985, Sherman was fired before recording commenced. In spite of this, he later provided the backing vocals to two songs on band's 1989 album, Mother's Milk. He subsequently collaborated with Bob Dylan in Knocked Out Loaded, funk musician George Clinton in R&B; Skeletons in the Closet, as well as Feargal Sharkey and Peter Case. When the Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, neither Sherman nor their former guitarist Dave Navarro, who had each played guitar on one of the band's albums, were inducted. Sherman blamed the band's members for the omission, saying that it ignored the work that they had put in having \\"soldiered on under arduous conditions\\". Anthony Kiedis, the lead vocalist of Red Hot Chili Peppers, wrote in his 2004 autobiography, Scar Tissue, that the band understood that its relationship with Sherman to be transient because he did not possess \\"a punk- rock pedigree\\". However, he acknowledged the important part Sherman played in keeping the band afloat. Death Sherman died on August 18, 2020 at the age of 64 of a heart attack at his home in Savannah, Georgia.The Red Hot Chili Peppers issued a statement on his death thanking him for \\"all times good, bad and in between\\".Red Hot Chili Peppers' bassist Flea would post his own personal tribute to Sherman on Instagram nearly a month later saying what while their relationship was \\"complicated\\", he cited Sherman as a influence on his music and his life saying he \\"played the most wicked guitar part on our song Mommy Where‚Äôs Daddy, a thing that influenced the way I heard rhythm forever. He taught me about diet, to eat clean and be conscious of my body. But more than anything, he was my friend. We came from very different backgrounds, had different world views, and it was hard for us to relate to one another often. But the excitement we shared over music, and the joy that bubbled up between us will last forever. Rest In Peace Sherm I love you.\\" Partial discography Source: * 1984 The Red Hot Chili Peppers ‚Äî Red Hot Chili Peppers *1985 Freaky Styley ‚Äî Red Hot Chili Peppers (co-wrote half the album however did not perform on it) * 1986 Knocked Out Loaded ‚Äî Bob Dylan * 1986 R&B; Skeletons in the Closet ‚Äî George Clinton * 1986 Echo Park soundtrack * 1988 Notes from the Lost Civilization ‚Äî Tonio K * 1988 Wish ‚Äî Feargal Sharkey * 1988 The Abbey Road E.P. ‚Äî Red Hot Chili Peppers * 1989 Mother's Milk ‚Äî Red Hot Chili Peppers (backing vocals on two songs) * 1989 The Man with the Blue Post-Modern Fragmented Neo-Traditionalist Guitar ‚Äî Peter Case * 1990 Soundtrack of My Life ‚Äî Kimm Rogers * 1990 Flashback soundtrack * 1992 What Hits!? ‚Äî Red Hot Chili Peppers * 1995 Chillin' In Hades - Bill Madden * 1996 Backroom Blood ‚Äî Gerry Goffin * 1997 Ol√© ‚Äî Tonio K * 1998 Under the Covers: Essential Red Hot Chili Peppers ‚Äî Red Hot Chili Peppers * 2000 In from the Cold ‚Äî In From The Cold ‚Äî original music with Gary Mallaber and Maria Sebastian * 2007 Luke Mitchell ‚Äî High Expectations * 2010 Eric Culberson ‚Äî In The Outside * 2011 Luke Mitchell ‚Äî Row Boat Row * 2013 Matthew Wesley ‚Äî REAL ReferencesExternal Links * 1956 births 2020 deaths American rock guitarists American male guitarists Red Hot Chili Peppers members Musicians from Miami Guitarists from Florida 20th-century American guitarists ","title":"Jack Sherman"},{"id":"1342275","text":"Cenchrus setaceus, commonly known as crimson fountaingrass, is a C4 perennial bunch grass that is native to open, scrubby habitats in East Africa, tropical Africa, the Middle East and south-western Asia.

Also referred to as the \\"Western disease\\" paradigm, these diseases are in contrast to so-called \\"diseases of poverty\\", which largely result from and contribute to human impoverishment. These diseases of affluence have vastly increased in prevalence since the end of World War II. Examples of diseases of affluence include mostly chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and other physical health conditions for which personal lifestyles and societal conditions associated with economic development are believed to be an important risk factor ‚Äî such as type 2 diabetes, asthma, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, hypertension, cancer, alcoholism, gout, and some types of allergy. They may also be considered to include depression and other mental health conditions associated with increased social isolation and lower levels of psychological well being observed in many developed countries. Many of these conditions are interrelated, for example obesity is thought to be a partial cause of many other illnesses. In contrast, the diseases of poverty have tended to be largely infectious diseases, or the result of poor living conditions. These include tuberculosis, malaria, and intestinal diseases. Increasingly, research is finding that diseases thought to be diseases of affluence also appear in large part in the poor. These diseases include obesity and cardiovascular disease and, coupled with infectious diseases, these further increase global health inequalities. Diseases of affluence started to become more prevalent in developing countries as diseases of poverty decline, longevity increases, and lifestyles change. In 2008, nearly 80% of deaths due to NCDs ‚Äî including heart disease, strokes, chronic lung diseases, cancers and diabetes ‚Äî occurred in low- and middle-income countries.World Health Organization. New WHO report: deaths from noncommunicable diseases on the rise, with developing world hit hardest. Geneva, 27 April 2011.  Top 10 causes of death in high income/affluent countries  According to World Health Organization (WHO) the top 10 causes of deaths in the high income countries/ affluent countries in 2016 were from # Ischemic heart diseases # Stroke # Alzheimer disease and other dementia # Trachea, bronchus and lung cancer # Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease # Lower respiratory infections # Colon and rectum cancers # Diabetes # Kidney diseases # Breast cancer Except for the lower respiratory infections, all of them are non-communicable diseases. In 2016 WHO reported 56.9 million deaths worldwide, and more than half (54%), were due to the top causes of death previously mentioned. Causes Factors associated with the increase of these conditions and illnesses appear to be things that are a direct result of technological advances. They include: *Less strenuous physical exercise, often through increased use of motor vehicles *Irregular exercise as a result of office jobs involving no physical labor. *Easy accessibility in society to large amounts of low-cost food (relative to the much-lower caloric food availability in a subsistence economy) **More food generally, with much less physical exertion expended to obtain a moderate amount of food **Higher consumption of vegetable oils and high sugar- containing foods **Higher consumption of meat and dairy products **Higher consumption of refined flours and products made of such, like white bread or white noodles **More foods which are processed, cooked, and commercially provided (rather than seasonal, fresh foods prepared locally at the time of eating) *Prolonged periods of little activity *Greater use of alcohol and tobacco *Longer lifespans **Reduced exposure to infectious agents throughout life (this can result in a more idle and inexperienced immune system, as compared to an individual who experienced relatively frequent exposure to certain pathogens in their time of life) *Increased cleanliness. The hygiene hypothesis postulates that children of affluent families are now exposed to fewer antigens than has been normal in the past, giving rise to increased prevalence of allergy and autoimmune diseases. Diabetes mellitus Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by increase blood glucose level. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. It is caused by resistance to insulin or the lack of production of insulin. It is seen most commonly in adults. Type 1 diabetes or juvenile diabetes affects mostly children. This condition is due to little or lack of insulin production from the pancreas. According to WHO the prevalence of diabetes has quadrupled from 1980 to 422 million adults. The global prevalence of diabetes has increased from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014. Diabetes has been a major cause for blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and lower limb amputation.  Prevalence in countries of affluence  The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report in 2015 indicating that more than 100 million Americans have diabetes or pre-diabetes. Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in United States in 2015. In developed countries like the United States, the risk for diabetes is seen in people with low socioeconomic status (SES). Socioeconomic status is defined by the education and the income level of a person. The prevalence of diabetes varies by education level. Of those diagnosed with diabetes:12.6% of adults had less than a high school education, 9.5% had a high school education and 7.2% had more than high school education. Differences in diabetes prevalence are seen in the population and ethnic groups in USA. Diabetes is more common in non- Hispanic whites who are less educated and have a lower income. It is also more common in less educated Hispanics. The highest prevalence of diabetes is seen in the southeast, southern and Appalachian portion of the United States. In the United States the prevalence of diabetes is increasing in children and adolescents. In 2015, 25 million people were diagnosed with diabetes, of which 193,000 were children. The total direct and indirect cost of diagnosed diabetes in US in 2012 was $245 billion. In 2009, the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) estimated that diagnosed diabetes will increase from 1.3 million in 2000 to 2.5 million in 2010 and 3.7 million in 2020. Diabetes was the 7th leading cause of death in Canada in 2015. Like United States, diabetes in more prevalent in the low socioeconomic group of people in Canada. According to the International Diabetes Federation, more than 58 million people are diagnosed with diabetes in the European Union Region (EUR), and this will go up to 66.7 million by 2045. Similar to other affluent countries like America and Canada, diabetes is more prevalent in the poorer parts of Europe like Central and Eastern Europe. In Australia according to self- reported data, 1 in 7 adults or approximately 1.2 million people had diabetes in 2014-2015. People who were living in remote or socioeconomically disadvantaged areas were 4 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as compared to non-indigenous Australians. Australia incurred $20.8 million in direct costs towards hospitalization, medication, and out-patient treatment towards diabetes. In 2015, $1.2 billion were lost in Australia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) due to diabetes. In these countries of affluence, diabetes is prevalent in low socioeconomic groups of people as there is abundance of unhealthy food choices, high energy rich food, and decreased physical activity. More affluent people are typically more educated and have tools to counter unhealthy foods, such as access to healthy food, physical trainers, and parks and fitness centers.  Risk factors  Obesity and being overweight is one of the main risk factors of type 2 diabetes. Other risk factors include lack of physical activity, genetic predisposition, being over 45 years old, tobacco use, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. In United States, the prevalence of obesity was 39.8% in adults and 18.5% in children and adolescents in 2015-2016. In Australia in 2014-2015, 2 out 3 adults or 63% were overweight or obese. Also, 2 out of 3 adults did little or no exercise. According to the World Health Organization, Europe had the 2nd highest proportion of overweight or obese people in 2014 behind the Americas.  In developing countries  According to WHO the prevalence of diabetes is rising more in the middle and low income countries. Over the next 25 years, the number of people with diabetes in developing countries will increase by over 150%. Diabetes is typically seen in people above the retirement age in developed countries, but in developing countries people in the age of 35-64 are mostly affected. Although, diabetes is considered a disease of affluence affecting the developed countries, there is more loss of life and premature death among people with diabetes in the developing countries. Asia accounts for 60% of the world's diabetic population. In 1980 less than 1% of Chinese adults were affected by diabetes, but by 2008 the prevalence was 10%. It is predicted that by 2030 diabetes may affect 79.4 million people in India, 42.3 million people in China and 30.3 million in United States. These changes are the result of developing nations having rapid economic development. This rapid economic development has caused a change in the lifestyle and food habits leading to over-nutrition, increased intake of fast food causing increase in weight, and insulin resistance. Compared to the west, obesity in Asia is low. India has very low prevalence of obesity, but a very high prevalence of diabetes suggesting that diabetes may occur at a lower BMI in Indians as compared to the Europeans. Smoking increases the risk for diabetes by 45%. In developing countries around 50-60 % adult males are regular smokers, increasing their risk for diabetes. In developing countries, diabetes is more commonly seen in the more urbanized areas. The prevalence of diabetes in rural population is 1/4th that of urban population for countries like India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka. Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease refers to a disease of the heart and blood vessels. Conditions and diseases associated with heart disease include: stroke, coronary heart disease, congenital heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and cardiomyopathy. Cardiovascular disease is known as the world's biggest killer. 17.5 million people die from it each year, which equals 31% of all deaths. Heart disease and stroke cause 80% of these deaths. Risk factors High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and has contributed to 12% of the cardiovascular related deaths worldwide. Other significant risk factors for heart disease include high cholesterol and smoking. 47% of all Americans have one of these three risk factors. Lifestyle choices, such as poor diet and physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use can also contribute to cardiovascular disease. Medical conditions, like diabetes and obesity can also be risk factors. Prevalence in countries of affluence In the United States, 610,000 people die every year from heart disease which is equal to 1 in 4 deaths. The leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States is heart disease. In Canada, heart disease is the second leading cause of death. In 2014, it was the cause of death for 51,000 people. In Australia, heart disease is also the leading cause of death. 29% of deaths in 2015, had an underlying cause of heart disease. Heart disease causes one in four premature deaths in the United Kingdom and in 2015 heart disease caused 26% of all deaths in that country. People of lower socio-economic status are more likely to have cardiovascular disease than those who have a higher socio- economic status. This inequality gap has occurred in developed countries because people who have a lower socio-economic status often face many of the risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use, obesity as well as having a sedentary lifestyle. Further social and environmental factors such as poverty, pollution, family history, housing and employment contribute to this inequality gap and to risk of having a health condition caused by cardiovascular disease. The increasing inequality gap between the higher and lower income populations continues in countries such as Canada, despite the availability of health care for everyone.  Alzheimer's disease and other dementias  Dementia is a chronic syndrome which is characterized by deterioration in the thought process beyond what is expected from normal aging. It affects the persons memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, behavior and ability to perform everyday activity. There are many different forms of dementia . Alzheimer is the most common form which contributes to 60-70 % of the dementia cases. Different forms of dementia can co-exist. Young onset dementia which occurs in individuals before the age of 65 contributes to 9% of the total cases. It is the major cause of disability and dependency among old people. Worldwide, there are 50 million people who are suffering from dementia and every year 10 million new cases are being reported. The total number of people with dementia is projected to reach 82 million by 2030 and 152 million in 2050 .  Prevalence in countries of affluence  According to CDC, Alzheimer is the 6th leading cause of death in U.S adults and 5th leading cause of death in adults over the age of 65. In 2014, 5 million Americans above the age of 65 were diagnosed with Alzheimer. This number is predicted to triple by the year 2060 and reach up to 14 million. Dementia and Alzheimer has been shown to go unreported on death certificates, leading to under representation of the actual mortality caused by these diseases. Between 2000 and 2015, mortality due to cardiovascular diseases has decreased by 11%, where as death from Alzheimer has increased by 123%. 1 in 3 people over the age of 65 die from Alzheimer or other forms of dementia. Furthermore, 200,000 individuals have been affected by young onset dementia. In United States, Alzheimer affects more women than men. It is twice more common in African-Americans and Hispanics than in whites. As the number of older Americans increases rapidly, the number of new cases of Alzheimer will rise too . East Asia has the most people living with dementia (9.8 million) followed by Western Europe (7.5 million), South Asia (5.1 million) and North America (4.8 million). In 2016, the prevalence of Alzheimer was 5.05% in Europe. Like in United States, it is more prevalent in women than in men. In the European Union, Finland has the highest mortality among both men and women due to dementia. In Canada, over half a million people are living with dementia. It is projected that by 2031 the number will go up by 66% to 937,000. Every year 25,000 new cases of dementia are diagnosed . Dementia is the second leading cause of death in Australia. In 2016, it was the leading cause of deaths in females. In Australia 436,366 people are living with dementia in 2018. 3 in 10 people over the age of 85 and 1 in 10 people over the age of 65 have dementia. It is the single greatest cause of disability in older Australians . Rates of dementia are higher for indigenous people. In people from the northern territory and western Australia the prevalence of dementia is 26 times higher in the 45-69 year old group and about 20 times greater in 60-69 year old group.  Risk factors in countries of affluence  The risk factors for developing dementia or Alzheimer's include age, family history, genetic factors, environmental factors, brain injury, viral infections, neurotoxic chemicals, and various immunological and hormonal disorders. A new research study has found an association between the affluence of a country, hygiene conditions and the prevalence of Alzheimer in their population. According to the Hygiene Hypothesis, affluent countries with more urbanized and industrialized areas have better hygiene, better sanitation, clean water and improved access to antibiotics. This reduces the exposure to the friendly bacteria, virus and other microorganisms that help stimulate our immune system. Decreased microbial exposure leads to immune system that is poorly developed, which exposes the brain to inflammation as is seen in Alzheimer's disease. Countries like the UK and France that have access to clean drinking water, improved sanitation facilities and have a high GDP show a 9% increase in Alzheimer's disease as opposed to countries like Kenya and Cambodia. Also countries like UK and Australia, where three quarters of their population lives in urban areas, have a 10% higher Alzheimer's rate than in countries like Bangladesh and Nepal where less than one tenth of their population live in urban areas. Alzheimer's risk changes with the environment. Individuals from the same ethnic background living in an area of low sanitation will have a lower risk as compared to the same individuals living in an area of high sanitation who will be exposed to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's. An African-American in U.S. has a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's as compared to one living in Nigeria. Immigrant populations exhibit Alzheimer disease rates intermediate between their home country and adopted country. Moving from a country of high sanitation to a country of low sanitation reduces the risk associated with the disease.  Mental illness  People who face poverty have more risks related to having a mental illness and also do not have as much access to treatment. The stressful events that they face, unsafe living condition and poor physical health lead to cycle of poverty and mental illness that is seen all over the world. According to the World Health Organization 76%-85% of people living in lower and middle income countries are not treated for their mental illness. For those in higher-income counties, 35%-50% of people with mental illness do not receive treatment. It is estimated that 90% of deaths by suicide are caused by substance use disorders and mental illness in higher income countries. In lower to middle income countries, this number is lower.  Prevalence of mental illness  One in four people have experienced mental illness at one time in their lives, and approximately 450 million people in the world currently have a mental illness. Those who are impoverished live in conditions associated with a higher risk for mental illness and, to compound the issue, do not have as much access to treatment. Stress, unsafe living conditions, and poor physical health associated with lack of sufficient income lead to a cycle of poverty and mental illness that is observed worldwide. Of all countries, India, China, and the United States have the highest levels of anxiety, depression and schizophrenia, according to the WHO. The proportion of people with depression is between 2% to 6%; Greenland, Australia, and the United States have the highest rates of this disorder. Of these three, the U.S. is reported to have the greatest rate of depression. In the U.S., approximately one in five adults has a mental illness, or 44.7 million people. In 2016, it was estimated that 268 million people in the world had depression. Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder affected 275 million people worldwide in 2016. The global proportion of people affected by anxiety disorders is between 2.5%-6.5%. Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Iran, the United States, and a number of countries in Western Europe appear to have a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders.  Cancer  Cancer is a generic term for a large group of disease which is characterized by rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries. These cells can invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs causing metastases, which is a major cause of death. According to WHO, Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally. One in six deaths worldwide are caused due to cancer, accounting to a total of 9.6 million deaths in 2018.Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer is the leading form of cancer deaths across most high and middle-income countries.  Prevalence in countries of affluence  In United States, 1,735,350 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in 2018. Most common forms of cancer are cancer of the breast, lung, bronchus, prostate, colorectal cancer, melanoma of skin, Non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal cancer, thyroid cancer and liver cancer. Cancer mortality is higher among men than in women. African-Americans have the highest risk of mortality due to cancer. Cancer is also the leading cause of death in Australia. The most common cancers in Australia are prostate, breast, colorectal, melanoma and lung cancer. These account for 60% of the cancer cases diagnosed in Australia. Europe contains only 1/8 of the world population, but has around one quarter of the global cancer cases, with 3.7 million new cases each year. Lung, breast, stomach, liver, colon are the most common cancers in Europe. The overall incidences among different cancers vary across countries. About one in two Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetime, and one in four will die of the disease. In 2017, 206,200 new cases of cancer were diagnosed. Lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer accounted for about half of all cancer diagnoses and deaths. Risk factors High prevalence of cancer in high-income countries is attributed to lifestyle factors like obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, diet and alcohol intake. Around 40% of the cancers can be prevented by modifying these factors.  Allergies/autoimmune diseases  The rate of allergies around the world has risen in industrialized nations over the past 50 years. A number of public health measures, such as sterilized milk, use of antibiotics and improved food production have contributed to a decrease in infections in developed countries. There is a proposed causal relationship, known as the \\"hygiene hypothesis\\" that indicates that there are more autoimmune disorders and allergies in developed countries with fewer infections. In developing countries, it is assumed that the rates of allergies are lower than developed countries. That assumption may not be accurate due to limited data on prevalence. Research has found an increase in asthma by 10% in countries such as Peru, Costa Rica, and Brazil.

In particular, because it uses UDP, it avoids the problems that many FTP servers have had with requiring a separate process for each client, and because it is built to use an unreliable protocol, it can more easily handle resuming a transfer after a network failure.  History  FSP never reached the popularity of FTP for legitimate use (although wuarchive and id Software provided FSP service in addition to FTP for some time), but became very popular in the early-to-mid-1990s for underground sites containing pornography and/or warez. Because an FSP server only requires one process (as opposed to one process per client for most FTP servers), it is much harder for a system administrator to notice it in a process list; also, since it uses UDP, it is less likely to be noticed by a network administrator. Eventually, however, an increased use of firewalls, a decreasing usage of the shell accounts required to run a server or most of the clients, and a lack of FSP support in web browsers caused its use to taper off, and the warez scene moved to HTTP and FXP while pornography moved to publicly advertised web servers.  Port number  As the FSP protocol is not officially recognized by IANA, it has no official port number. However, as a UDP equivalent of FTP, official FSP servers frequently run on UDP port 21, which is the same as FTP's TCP port number. Because FSP uses UDP and FTP uses TCP they can both run at same time on the same port number without conflict. Unofficial servers may run on any port, although 2121 was a popular choice. (On most *nix systems, only the root user can start a process that listens on a port under 1024.)  Protocol name  The name FSP was originally created without a real expansion. In 1993, discussions were held about what to expand the acronym to; the ultimate result was File Service Protocol. Other suggestions included File Slurping Protocol, FTP's Sexier Partner, and Flaky Stream Protocol. Due to its inherent low performance, FSP was sometimes colloquially said to stand for \\"Fucking Slow Protocol\\" .

Life and career Carnes was born in North Carolina. The son of a piano teacher, he received his first formal musical training on trumpet in the public schools. He formed and played in several rock bands beginning in the late 1960s. While originally a performer of popular music and jazz, Carnes became interested in classical music and resumed his education. He studied composition under John Bavicchi at Berklee College of Music where he received his BA in 1977, John Thow and Theodore Antoniou at Boston University where he received his Masters in Music in 1980 and later with Rudi Martinus van Dijk and Gunther Schuller. His early works were largely tonal and reflective of jazz. These include a number of guitar etudes. In the years that followed, his music became more strongly chromatic, without an obvious tonal center. Principal works from this period include Fantasy Music 1 (for flute and taped electronic sounds), Fantasy Music 2 (for harpsichord and taped electronic sounds), and Marimba Concerto. An intermediate period included Brass Quintet #2, War Songs (for voice and taped electronic sounds), and Variations (computer). More recently, his style has moved into a more flexible variant of the 12-tone technique. Recent works include Brass Quintet #3, Symphony: Challenger and Proper Motion (trio for flute, clarinet, piano) which had its world premiere at the Park City and Salt Lake City International Music Festival in 2005.Reichel (21 August 2005) During his years in Boston, Carnes was a member of the \\"Composers in Red Sneakers\\" collective.Cleary (June 2000) p. 13 In 1985, the group inaugurated the 8th season of contemporary music at New York's Symphony Space.Page (6 October 1985) Amongst the pieces on the program were two songs for mezzo-soprano and marimba by Carnes set to texts by e.e. cummings with Nancy Zeltsman on the marimba.Holland (13 October 1985) Recordings Fantasy Music 1 is included on the 1984 Northeastern Records LP, Composers in Red Sneakers.

The term millefiori is a combination of the Italian words \\"mille\\" (thousand) and \\"fiori\\" (flowers). Apsley Pellatt in his book Curiosities of Glass Making was the first to use the term \\"millefiori\\", which appeared in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1849; prior to that, the beads were called mosaic beads. While the use of this technique long precedes the term \\"millefiori\\", it is now most frequently associated with Venetian glassware. Since the late 1980s, the millefiori technique has been applied to polymer clay and other materials. As the polymer clay is quite pliable and does not need to be heated and reheated to fuse it, it is a much easier medium in which to produce millefiori patterns than glass.

Venetian millefiori bead The technical knowledge for creating millefiori was lost by the eighteenth century, and the technique was not revived until the nineteenth century. Within several years of the technique's rediscovery, factories in Italy, France and England were manufacturing millefiori canes. They were often incorporated into fine glass art paperweights. Until the 15th century, Murano glass makers were only producing drawn Rosetta beads made from molded Rosetta canes. Rosetta beads are made by the layering of a variable number of layers of glass of various colors in a mold, and by pulling the soft glass from both ends until the cane has reached the desired thickness. It is then cut into short segments for further processing. Production Millefiori glass pendant The millefiori technique involves the production of glass canes or rods, known as murrine, with multicolored patterns which are viewable only from the cut ends of the cane. A murrine rod is heated in a furnace and pulled until thin while still maintaining the cross section's design. It is then cut into beads or discs when cooled.

Part of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone, it has a prominent, -high cone. A summit crater containing Licancabur Lake, a crater lake which is among the highest lakes in the world, caps the volcano. Three stages of lava flow emanate from the volcano, which formed on Pleistocene ignimbrites. Licancabur has been active during the Holocene, after the ice ages. Although no historic eruptions of the volcano are known, lava flows extending into Laguna Verde have been dated to 13,240 ¬± 100 BP. The volcano has primarily erupted andesite, with small amounts of dacite and basaltic andesite. Its climate is cold, dry and very sunny, with high levels of ultraviolet radiation. Licancabur is not covered by glaciers, and vegetation such as cushion plants and shrubs are found lower on its slopes. Chinchillas were formerly hunted on the volcano. Licancabur is considered a holy mountain by the Atacameno people, related to the Cerro Quimal hill in northern Chile. Archeological sites have been found on its slopes and in the summit crater, which was possibly a prehistoric watchtower. Name \\"Licancabur\\" derives from the Kunza words used by the Atacame√±o people to refer to the volcano: lican (\\"people\\", or pueblo) and c√°bur (\\"mountain\\"); thus, \\"mountain of the people\\". It is also known as \\"Volcan de Atacama\\" and \\"Licancaur\\".  Geography and geology = General setting  The Andean Volcanic Belt consists of three main volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone (from 2¬∞ N to 5¬∞ S), the Central Volcanic Zone (16¬∞ to 28¬∞ S) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (33¬∞ to 46¬∞ S). Active volcanism occurs where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The plates are separated by shallower subduction zones, with no present-day volcanism. These shallower zones have been attributed to the high speed of the plate collision, the young age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the curvature of the subducting plate. The most plausible theory is that variations in buoyancy of a subducting plate creates a flat subduction zone. The Cocos, Juan Fernandez and Nazca Ridges are associated with such volcanic gaps where they collide with the oceanic trench. The subduction of spreading ridges can also diminish volcanism, as observed in the Chile Rise further south. The buoyancy of these crustal structures may hinder subduction, reducing water supply to the mantle and inducing the formation of melts. Not all volcanism in Chile is relative to subduction of the Nazca Plate; the Chile Ridge exhibits submarine volcanism, and volcanism in the Austral Volcanic Zone is triggered by the Antarctic Plate subducting beneath the South American Plate. One hundred ninety-eight South American volcanoes are on the Global Volcanism Program's Holocene volcano list.  Local setting  Licancabur across Laguna Verde Licancabur is part of the Central Volcanic Zone at the western edge of the Altiplano. Among the region's active volcanoes are Putana (erupted at the end of the 19th century), Llullaillaco (1868) and Lascar (1993). Other stratovolcanoes are Tacora, Nevados de Payachata, Isluga, Tata Sabaya, Ollague, Tocorpuri, Sairecabur and Socompa. The Central Volcanic Zone has more than 1,100 volcanic centres‚Äîmany older than the Pleistocene, since the area's prevailing arid climate prevented substantial erosion. During the Miocene, the area around Licancabur became the site of major ignimbrite-forming eruptions. Llano de Chajnantor (southeast of Licancabur) is the site of several observatories, including the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory. The volcano is just south of Sairecabur, a group of volcanoes which rises to and is an apparent source of recent volcanic activity. East of Licancabur is its companion volcano, Juriques. This -high volcano has a large‚Äî‚Äîdeep crater and is considered a parasitic cone. West-east alignments of volcanoes like Licancabur and Juriques are common in the region, due to tectonic influences. Araral, Cerro Cabana, Cerro Canapa, Cerros de Tocorpuri, Cerro Linzor, Inacaliri, Inca, Jardin, Putana, Volcan Tatio and Zapaleri are other volcanoes in the neighbourhood of Licancabur. southeast, the volcanic chain continues with Tocol, the Purico Complex and the -high Llullaillaco. Volcanoes in the Puna de Atacama formed during the Pliocene on Tertiary dacite, liparite and rhyolite ignimbrites. These rocks have a light colour, due to the rhyolite. Licancabur was formed over 1.35-million-year-old Purico, La Pacana and Chaxas ignimbrite. The Chaxas ignimbrite erupted 1.09 ¬± 0.56 million years ago. Licancabur is a -high symmetrical cone. The cone, rising above the surrounding terrain, has a base diameter of and a total volume of . The top of the mountain is a -wide crater, and its slopes have an approximately 30¬∞ gradient. The volcano has erupted blocky lava flows, with thicknesses ranging from ; younger lava flows are thinner. Young lava flows on the western sides of the volcano are long; older flows extend . Some old lava flows reach Laguna Verde, and -long pyroclastic flow deposits have been found. The volcano's eastern and western flanks look different, since it formed on a basement which dips towards the Salar de Atacama. West of Licancabur are deposits stemming from debris avalanche activity, including blocks wide. The border between Bolivia and Chile, defined by the Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904), crosses the volcano. Licancabur Lake An elliptical lake was identified in the Licancabur crater beneath the crater rim, with a length of and a depth of . Fed by snowfall, it is one of the highest lakes in the world. Based on its relative lack of salt deposits, in 1955 researchers postulated that the lake spilled through a notch in the crater's southwestern rim when the climate was wetter. Excess water now leaves through seepage, keeping salt levels low. There are other lakes (usually frozen) at similar altitudes in the Andes. The slopes of Licancabur are unstable and prone to rock falls. Some of the instability may be due to earthquakes, snow, wind or geothermal effects (resulting in thermal stress), and it frustrated a 1920s attempt by a Chuquicamata engineer to climb the mountain.  Composition  Licancabur has erupted primarily andesite, but basaltic andesite and dacite have also been found. The rocks are dark and grey-coloured. Basaltic andesite was found in the older lavas, and dacite in the more-recent ones. Although the rocks have a seriate texture, the groundmass is hyalopilitic. Phenocrysts include amphibole, clinopyroxene, hornblende, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and titanomagnetite; olivine is found in andesite, and biotite in dacites. Plagioclase is the most common. The amount of phenocrysts in Licancabur's rocks is smaller than that in other Central Volcanic Zone volcanoes, such as Lascar. Clots of crystals with diameters of or larger have also been found. They contain glass, microliths and phenocrysts, and have a composition similar to phenocrysts. The clots probably formed from the aggregation of phenocrysts and their subsequent growth; some phenocrysts in the rocks formed when the clots broke apart. The temperature of Licancabur's pre-eruption magma determined the composition of the rocks; it ranges from for dacite to for andesite. Isotope ratios are typical of Central Volcanic Zone volcanoes. There are differences in the elemental composition of andesites and dacites, with the latter resembling adakites more than the former. Antisana (in the Northern Volcanic Zone) and El Negrillar (in the Central Volcanic Zone) are two other centres which have erupted adakites or adakite-like lavas. Based on its composition, it is assumed that the magma at Licancabur formed from the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis. This magma melted part of the mantle wedge above the subducting plate, mixing with the melt products. Further contamination by crustal Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite-like rocks from the Archean, crystal fractionation and magma mixing further up in the crust then yielded the Licancabur magmas. The younger lavas may have formed from the mixing of dacite with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be from wall rocks of the magma chamber. Xenoliths containing gabbro are also found. Unlike neighbouring volcanoes, such as Saciel at Sairecabur (further north) and Tocol (further south), there appear to be no sulfur deposits on Licancabur.  Climate and ecosystem  Llamas and vegetation in front of Licancabur The region's climate has been dry since the Tertiary. The area around Licancabur is dominated by year-round high pressure caused by the South Pacific High, giving it a very sunny climate. Because of the lack of moisture, solar radiation energy is dissipated primarily by wind. In the Llano de Chajnantor area, wind generally reaches its maximum strength during the day. Its prevailing direction is from the west, except in summer when winds are more variable. Because of the area's tropical location (where the ozone layer is thinner) and high altitude, it receives a large amount of ultraviolet radiation. The world's highest level of ultraviolet radiation was reported from Licancabur, although the high irradiation might have caused measurement artifacts. Air temperatures obtained at the lake in Licancabur's crater range from . According to observers in 1955, temperatures at the Licancabur summit were always below freezing, sometimes falling below . At Llano de Chajnantor, southeast of Licancabur, weather records indicate that maximum temperatures range from . Average precipitation on Licancabur is estimated at about per year, but snowfall probably exceeded in 1955. Snow has been recorded at Llano de Chajnantor when easterly winds transport moisture from the Amazon to the area in summer. Licancabur has no persistent snowpack; snow deposited by storms usually disappears within a few days. In sheltered areas, however, it can persist for months. Licancabur's present snow line is estimated at . The Llano de Chajnantor (Chajnantor Plateau); the cone in the background is Licancabur. Vegetation at lower altitudes is typical of a high tropical desert climate. Three biozones have been described in the region: an Andean zone from , with cushion plants and tussock grass; a Puna zone from , and a pre-Puna zone from with thorny shrubs. In oases and river valleys of the depression between the pre-Cordillera and the Andes, shrubs such as Atriplex grow; however, the surrounding Atacama Desert is mainly devoid of plant life. Meltwater from snow supports more life, at higher altitudes, on Licancabur than on similar mountains. Grasses, tola bushes, butterflies, flies and lizards are found as high as . Life further down the mountain could be supported by the fertilizing effect of dust from volcanic rocks. Polylepis incana might have been more prevalent at Licancabur during wetter times, and is now more common in Bolivia. Chinchillas were found as high as in 1955. The upper parts of the mountain had been avoided by hunters, and after some high- altitude attempts during the 1920s chinchilla hunting disappeared from the area. Licancabur is part of the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve.  Eruptive history  Licancabur formed in three units, all of which have lava flows; the last one also includes pyroclastic deposits. The bulk of the cone was formed by the second unit. The second unit's eruption was preceded by the injection of basic magma into the magma chamber. The oldest flows crop out on the western and northern sides of the volcano and are partially covered by more-recent flows from Licancabur and flows from Sairecabur. Flows from both appear to be pre-glacial. The older lavas have compositions similar to shoshonite and old Sairecabur lavas, and tend to be more basic than recent lavas. Weak explosive activity left pyroclastic deposits on the volcano. Licancabur formed primarily after the late glacial period, between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. Flank lava flows are its youngest feature. The neighbouring Juriques dates to the Pleistocene. Licancabur's lava flows were not affected by glaciation, and some have levees and ridges. Lava flows reaching Laguna Verde have been radiocarbon dated to 13,240 ¬± 100 BP, and 13,270 ¬± 100 years old lacustrine sediments have been buried by Licancabur flows. The volcano has not erupted during recorded history, but bubbling and water temperatures of have been observed in the crater lake of Licancabur, which may remain liquid due to geothermal heating.  Human settlement  Ruins at the foot of Licancabur Despite being lower than many neighbouring mountains, Licancabur stands out from other volcanoes in the region and is well-known. The Atacameno people worshiped it, and other high mountains are still considered sacred. Licancabur was considered divine, and attempts to climb it were discouraged and sometimes met by force; climbing it supposedly brought misfortune. It is said that Licancabur would punish people who climbed it, and the volcano is the mate of Quimal in the Cordillera Domeyko; at the solstices, the mountains overshadow one another. According to local myth, this copulation fertilizes the earth. Another legend mentions that a legless Inka king lived on Licancabur's summit; he was carried around in a litter and sometimes the carriers died from exhaustion and were buried with treasures. Finally, there is a story about Inkas hiding gold and silver in the crater lake; the wares disappeared and supposedly turned the lake bitter and emerald-green. Licancabur is considered \\"male\\" and a mountain of fire, in contrast to San Pedro (considered a mountain of water). The was considered divine retribution for an attempt to climb the mountain that year. According to legend, a golden object (most commonly a guanaco) was offered as tribute in the summit crater; human sacrifices have been reported on the volcano. Between 1,500 and 1,000 years ago, people were buried in San Pedro de Atacama in a posture facing the volcano and the Pukar√° de Quitor fortress in Chile is also oriented towards the mountain. In 1953, climbers found three buildings open on one side on Licancabur. They were built in the pirca style, where stones are fitted together without mortar. A woodpile was found between two of the buildings, which were described as two dwellings and a fireplace. Wood was also scattered around its crater. With the summit's panoramic view, which includes Calama and pass routes from Argentina, Licancabur may have been a watchtower for the Atacamenos. Its watchtower function may have been coordinated with fortresses in the area such as Lasana, Turi and a settlement identified in 1955 at Quebrada de Chaxas (northwest of the volcano). The settlement at Licancabur had a central courtyard, surrounded by buildings, and ceramics found there resemble these of Pukar√° de Quitor and Toconao Oriente. A tambo reportedly existed at the volcano. Licancabur, seen from the town of San Pedro de Atacama Other archeological findings on Andean mountains were made on Acamarachi and Pular (where ceremonial platforms were found), Cerro Colorado, Juriques, Llullaillaco, Miniques and Quimal. Sites had pirca structures and firewood, and some may have been part of a signaling system. Many were in use during the Inca civilization, and on Quimal artifacts and reports of use during the Spanish Empire have been found. Aconcagua, Coropuna, Chachani, El Plomo, El Toro, Llullaillaco, Mercedario and Picchu Picchu are other mountains with Inca sanctuaries. The area around Licancabur was first settled by the Atacameno people, presumably because of the water in local canyons. The Incas, under Yawar Waqaq, were followed by the Spanish during the early 16th century in the region; both were looking for yareta and chinchillas. Unlike neighbouring mountains, Licancabur is difficult to climb; its upper part slopes steeply, and the ground is loose and prone to landslides. Ascent from the Bolivian side takes six hours plus half that time for the descent and requires caution during winter, although the mountain can be climbed during any month. Rumours about a \\"staircase\\", later probably obliterated by landslides and rockfalls, were reported in 1955. In 1953, a road climbed to . The first recorded ascent of the volcano was in 1884 by Severo Titicocha, who was accompanied by Juan Santelices (a delegate of the Chilean government) in an 1886 ascent. Landmines have been reported from the Chilean side.

It is one of Ottawa's oldest surviving church buildings and one of its most historic. History St. Alban's started in Sandy Hill in 1865. The original Gothic Revival design for the church was done in 1866 by Thomas Fuller, who also designed Canada's original Parliament Buildings. The cornerstone of the church was laid on May 9, 1867. Construction of the church began in 1867 and it was completed in 1868. The chancel and vestry were completed by King McCord Arnoldi (1843‚Äì1904). 1876-77 Ottawa Citizen, 8 Nov. 1867, 3, descrip.; 17 July 1876, 1, t.c.; Free Press [Ottawa], 9 Feb. 1877, 4, descrip.; A. Davidson, Annals of the Parish of St. Alban the Martyr, Ottawa 1865-1942, (8-9) King McCord Arnoldi However, the location of the church, at the corner of King Edward and Daly (454 King Edward Avenue), is on a steep hill and Fuller's elaborate plans had to be greatly scaled back. The church was attended by many of Canada's early political leaders, including Sir John A. Macdonald. The church rectory was designed in 1898 by Charles Penruddocke William Kivas Band of Band, Burrit & Meredith.Charles Penruddocke William Kivas Band The church's namesake is Saint Alban, who was the first British Christian martyr. He was martyred for \\"harbouring and sheltering the oppressed and terrified\\" (Michael W. Newton, The Parish of St. Alban the Martyr, Ottawa 1865-1877). The building has a Municipal designation under the Ontario Heritage Act, Section 29. There is an Ontario Heritage Trust easement agreement. Controversy and split In 2008, after the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa decided to allow clergy to bless same-sex marriages, St. Alban's and its sister church, St. George's, voted to leave the Anglican Church of Canada in favour of a breakaway group, the Anglican Network in Canada. The vote at St. Alban's was 79-1 in favour of the move. In 2010, the Diocese sued for possession of both buildings; a settlement was reached in January 2011, in which St. George's was sold to the ANiC but St. Alban's returned to its original diocese. ANiC clergy would have to leave, though the diocese stressed that members of the congregation remained welcome at the building.Marites N. Sison, \\"Ottawa Churches Settle Dispute\\", Anglican Journal of Canada, 15 February 2011 On June 26, 2011, during the last Sunday service before the required move-out date, Bishop Charlie Masters lead the former St. Alban's congregation out of the building and into a temporary location inside the Ottawa Little Theatre. Reverend George Sinclair stressed the move was not simply about homosexuality, but about the broader direction of the church and the need to uphold biblical authority. As of May 2016, the congregation continues to meet at the Ottawa Little Theatre, under the name Church of the Messiah.  New Congregation  The Anglican Diocese of Ottawa officially took possession of the building and name of St. Alban's Church on July 1, 2011. July 3, 2011, the first service under the new incumbent Reverend Mark Whittall, featured a baptism and an address from Bishop John Chapman, who described St. Alban's as a \\"spirit-led, Christ-centred and contemporary urban church\\". Though an \\"official opening\\" was held in September 2011, extensive renovations were needed to accommodate the return of Centre 454 to the church basement, as well as create office space and washrooms upstairs to compensate for the space the Centre would be taking up. These were not complete until November 2012, one month after Rev. Whittall was finally inducted. Since then, St. Alban's has been involved in a number of notable activities, such as hosting the uOttawa Open Table event, a free monthly meal for students and young adults; participating in the city-wide Big Give, an annual series of free pop-up stores for in-need neighbours; and officiating the first example of a transgender renaming liturgy in the Ottawa diocese. In January 2016, Rev. Whittall published a book on his experience so far at St. Alban's, titled ReInvention: Stories from an Urban Church.  Centre 454  Between 1976 and 2000, the basement at St. Alban's was home to Centre 454, an Anglican Community Ministry drop-in site for homeless and \\"precariously housed\\" people. The Centre moved for a time to rented space on Murray Street, but returned to St. Alban's in 2012 after extensive renovations of the basement. The Centre features regular social activities, as well as an ODSP support worker program to improve access to disability benefits, and \\"in-reach\\" services from outside professionals.

It closely resembles the Selberg zeta function, and is used to relate closed walks to the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. The Ihara zeta function was first defined by Yasutaka Ihara in the 1960s in the context of discrete subgroups of the two-by-two p-adic special linear group. Jean-Pierre Serre suggested in his book Trees that Ihara's original definition can be reinterpreted graph-theoretically. It was Toshikazu Sunada who put this suggestion into practice in 1985. As observed by Sunada, a regular graph is a Ramanujan graph if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis.Terras (1999) p. 678 Definition The Ihara zeta function is defined as the analytic continuation of the infinite product \\\\zeta_{G}\\\\left(u\\\\right)=\\\\prod_{p}\\\\frac{1}{1-u^{\\\\mathrm{L}(p)}} The product in the definition is taken over all prime closed geodesics p of the graph G = (V, E), where geodesics which differ by a cyclic rotation are considered equal. A closed geodesic p on G (known in graph theory as a \\"closed walk\\") is a finite sequence of vertices p = (v_0, \\\\ldots, v_{k-1}) such that : (v_i, v_{(i+1)\\\\bmod k}) \\\\in E, : v_i eq v_{(i+2) \\\\bmod k}. The integer k is the length L(p) of p. The closed geodesic p is prime if it cannot be obtained by repeating a closed geodesic m times, for an integer m > 1. This graph- theoretic formulation is due to Sunada. Ihara's formula Ihara (and Sunada in the graph-theoretic setting) showed that for regular graphs the zeta function is a rational function. If G is a q+1-regular graph with adjacency matrix A thenTerras (1999) p. 677 :\\\\zeta_G(u) = \\\\frac{1}{(1-u^2)^{r(G)-1}\\\\det(I - Au + qu^2I)} \\\\ where r(G) is the circuit rank of G. If G is connected and has n vertices, r(G)-1=(q-1)n/2. The Ihara zeta-function is in fact always the reciprocal of a graph polynomial: :\\\\zeta_G(u) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\det (I-Tu)}~, where T is Ki-ichiro Hashimoto's edge adjacency operator. Hyman Bass gave a determinant formula involving the adjacency operator. Applications The Ihara zeta function plays an important role in the study of free groups, spectral graph theory, and dynamical systems, especially symbolic dynamics, where the Ihara zeta function is an example of a Ruelle zeta function.Terras (2010) p. 29  References   Zeta and L-functions Algebraic graph theory ","title":"Ihara zeta function"},{"id":"1342364","text":"Ziconotide (SNX‚Äì111; Prialt) is an atypical analgesic agent for the amelioration of severe and chronic pain. Derived from Conus magus, a cone snail, it is the synthetic form of an œâ-conotoxin peptide. It is 1,000 times as powerful as morphine.http://www.chninternational.com/cone_snail_venom_attacking_pain.htm In December 2004 the Food and Drug Administration approved ziconotide when delivered as an infusion into the cerebrospinal fluid using an intrathecal pump system. Discovery Ziconotide is derived from the toxin of the cone snail species Conus magus. Scientists have been intrigued by the effects of the thousands of chemicals in marine snail toxins since the initial investigations in the late 1960s by Baldomero Olivera. Olivera, now a professor of biology in the University of Utah, was inspired by accounts of the deadly effects of these toxins from his childhood in the Philippines. Ziconotide was discovered in the early 1980s by University of Utah research scientist Michael McIntosh, when he was barely out of high school and working with Baldomero Olivera. Ziconotide was developed into an artificially manufactured drug by Elan Corporation. It was approved for sale under the name Prialt by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on December 28, 2004, and by the European Commission on February 22, 2005. Azur Pharma acquired worldwide rights (except Europe) to Prialt in 2010. Mechanism of action Ziconotide is a hydrophilic molecule that is freely soluble in water and is practically insoluble in methyl t-butyl ether. Ziconotide acts as a selective N-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker. This action inhibits the release of pro-nociceptive neurochemicals like glutamate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in pain relief. Therapeutic use Due to the profound side effects or lack of efficacy when delivered through more common routes, such as orally or intravenously, ziconotide must be administered intrathecally (i.e. directly into the spinal fluid). As this is the most expensive and invasive method of drug delivery and involves additional risks of its own, ziconotide therapy is generally considered appropriate (as evidenced by the range of use approved by the FDA in the US) only for ‚Äúmanagement of severe chronic pain in patients for whom intrathecal (IT) therapy is warranted and who are intolerant of or refractory to other treatment, such as systemic analgesics, adjunctive therapies or IT morphine‚Äù. Research is ongoing to determine whether ziconotide can be formulated in a way that would allow it to be administered by less invasive means. However, this must be weighed against the high level of pain management, both in terms of degree and length, and the apparent lack of tolerance and other signs of dependence even after extended treatment along with the need for alternatives to other therapies that have not worked for the patient. Ziconotide is also contraindicated for patients with certain preexisting mental disorders (e.g. psychosis) due to evidence that they are more susceptible to certain severe side effects.prialt.com Adverse reactions The most common side effects are dizziness, nausea, confusion, nystagmus and headache. Others may include weakness, hypertonia, ataxia, abnormal vision, anorexia, somnolence, unsteadiness on feet, vertigo, urinary retention, pruritus, increased sweating, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, fever, rigors, sinusitis, muscle spasms, myalgia, insomnia, anxiety, amnesia, nystagmus, tremor, memory impairment and induced psychiatric disorders. Other side effects which are less frequent but still clinically significant include auditory and visual hallucinations, thoughts of suicide, acute kidney failure, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular accident, sepsis, new or worsening depression, paranoia, disorientation, meningitis and seizures. Therefore, it is contraindicated in people with a history of psychosis, schizophrenia, clinical depression, and bipolar disorder. Recent incidents suggesting a link between intrathecal ziconotide treatment and increased risk of suicide have led to calls for strict and ongoing psychiatric monitoring of patients to avoid suicide occurring in vulnerable individuals. There is no known antidote. Structure Ziconotide is a peptide with the amino acid sequence H-Cys-Lys- Gly-Lys-Gly-Ala-Lys-Cys-Ser-Arg-Leu-Met-Tyr-Asp-Cys-Cys-Thr-Gly-Ser-Cys-Arg- Ser-Gly-Lys-Cys-NH2 and contains 3 disulfide bonds.

The main span of is the third longest span of any continuous truss in the world.Durkee, Jackson, World's Longest Bridge Spans, National Steel Bridge Alliance, May 24, 1999. It is also the longest bridge in the Baltimore metropolitan area. The bridge was opened in March 1977 and is named for the author of the American national anthem, the poem originally called \\"The Defence of Fort McHenry\\" written in September 1814 and later set to music and entitled the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" by Frederick and Georgetown lawyer /amateur poet Francis Scott Key (1779-1843). The bridge is the outermost of three toll crossings of Baltimore's Harbor (two tunnels and one bridge). Upon completion, the bridge structure and its approaches became the final links in Interstate 695 (the \\"Baltimore Beltway\\"), completing a two decades long project. Despite the I-695 signage, the bridge is officially considered part of the state highway system and designated Maryland Route 695. The bridge is long and carries an estimated 11.5 million vehicles annually. It is a designated hazardous materials truck route, as HAZMATs are prohibited in the Baltimore Harbor and Fort McHenry tunnels. The Key Bridge is a toll facility operated by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA). The toll rate for cars as of July 1, 2013 is $4.00. The bridge is also part of the E-ZPass system, and includes two dedicated E-ZPass lanes in its toll plaza in both the northbound and southbound directions. In April 2019, MDTA announced that the bridge will become a cashless toll facility by October 2019. With this system, customers without E-ZPass pay using video tolling. Cashless tolling began on the bridge on October 30, 2019. Background In the 1960s, the old Maryland State Roads Commission concluded there was a need for a second harbor crossing after the earlier Baltimore Harbor Thruway and Tunnel opened in 1957 and began planning another single-tube tunnel under the Patapsco River, further to the southeast, downstream from the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. The proposed site was between Hawkins Point and Sollers Point in the outer harbor. Plans also were underway for a drawbridge to the south over Curtis Creek (replacing an earlier 1931 drawbridge carrying Pennington Avenue over the creek) to connect Hawkins Point to Sollers Point. (At the same time, a bridge was planned for the segment of an additional through highway for the East Coast with I-95 that would run through the city near Fort McHenry and paralleling the now two decades old Harbor Tunnel Thruway; this was replaced by what is now known as the Fort McHenry Tunnel, a major expensive project four-tube facility running under and curving around historic 1798 Fort McHenry that opened in 1985). Sign for the Key Bridge used on approach roads Contractors took bearings of the outer harbor bottom and ship channel in the spring of 1969. Bids for construction of the proposed tunnel were opened on July 30, 1970, but price proposals were substantially higher than the engineering estimates. Officials drafted alternative plans, including the concept of a four-lane bridge. The bridge, at an estimated cost of $110 (USD) million, represented the best alternative because it allowed for more traffic lanes and carried lower operating and maintenance costs than a tunnel. In addition, a bridge would provide a route across the Baltimore Harbor for vehicles transporting hazardous materials (these materials are prohibited from both the Baltimore Harbor and Fort McHenry tunnels). Construction began in 1972, and the bridge opened to traffic on March 23, 1977. Including its connecting approaches, the bridge project is in length. Other structures along the thruway include a dual-span drawbridge over Curtis Creek and two parallel bridge structures that carry traffic over Bear Creek, near the former Bethlehem Steel Sparrows Point plant, this portion of the project not being fully complete until the late 1990s. Located in an area rich with American history, scholars believe the span crosses within of the site, marked in the water off the bridge by a red-white-blue buoy with stars and stripes painted on it, where Francis Scott Key, held aboard an American truce ship with the British Royal Navy fleet witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry on the days and nights of September 12-13-14, 1814. That battle and bombardment inspired Key to write the words of the Star Spangled Banner. Located just southeast of the bridge and adjacent underneath are the ruins of the island shoals of Sollers Flats with Fort Carroll, begun building in the 1840s under the supervision of United States Army Corps of Engineers, then Col. Robert E. Lee. There is another bridge called the Francis Scott Key Bridge, located in Washington, DC on US 29. It crosses the Potomac River, and links the District in Georgetown on the north shore to Reston and Arlington, Virginia to the south.

The Constitution of the People‚Äôs Republic of China currently classifies towns as third-level administrative units, along with townships () and ethnic minority townships (The State Council, 2014). A township is typically smaller in population and more remote than a town (zh√®n). Yangxin County, Hubei Similarly to a higher-level administrative units, the borders of a town (zhen) would typically include an urban core (what one would call a \\"town\\" in Europe or America - a small town with the population on the order of 10,000 people), as well as rural area with some villages (, or ). Towns in China are relatively small in size and in population compared to cities, but those with particular characteristics can enjoy great popularity among tourists. For example, the ancient town of Fenghuang attracts young backpackers every year for its minority ethnic culture and architecture.  Map representation  A typical provincial map would merely show a zhen with a circle centered at its urban area and labeled with its name, while a more detailed one (e.g., the map of Xianning prefecture-level city at its official web site) would also show the borders dividing the county or county-level city into town () and/or township () units.

He was the son of painter Juliusz Kossak, and twin brother of freedom fighter Tadeusz Kossak, and the father of two highly talented literary daughters, Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska and Magdalena Samozwaniec and of a painter son, Jerzy Kossak. Kossak's Pi≈Çsudski on Horseback, 1928, National Museum, Warsaw‚Äîone of the most popular artistic portrayals of Pi≈Çsudski Life Wojciech Horacy Kossak was born on New Year's Eve of 1856 just before midnight, while his twin brother, Tadeusz Kossak, just after, on 1 January 1857, in Paris. The family eventually left France. His middle name was in honour of his godfather, French painter Horace Vernet. Kossak began his education upon his family's return to Poland. He went to middle school at Three Crosses Square in Warsaw and later attended high school, the Gimnazjum ≈õw. Anny, in Krak√≥w. He simultaneously studied painting with his father Juliusz. Between 1871‚Äì1873, Wojciech studied at the School of Drawing and Painting - later the School of Fine Arts - under W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åuszczkiewicz, followed by a stint until 1875, at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, with professors Aleksander Str√§huber and Alexander Wagner. Kossak's Olszynka Grochowska, ca 1931 National Museum, Warsaw Last years Kossak was a very hard-working and prolific painter. It is impossible to mention all of his paintings, and he painted until the end of his life and made plans for new ventures until the last moments. Paintings from this period include: Marriage of Poland with the Sea, Portrait of Edward Krasi≈Ñski, Fantasy on the theme of Polish driving, Guarding the Polish sea, Portrait of Cardinal Hlond, Portrait of General Kazimierz Sosnkowski. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Kossak spent the summer of 1939 in Jurata, from where he returned to Krak√≥w in the last days of August, where they watched the invasion of Germans. The September defeat was a shock for Kossak, but he still believed in the Polish soldier: He wrote to a friend: \\"With the moment of our defeats and the disgrace of this poor Rydz, who was so immature in his role, I lost my heart not knowing that what was my beloved topic, not only ceased to be the most popular, but today the most expensive sursum corda has happened\\". He did not stop painting during the occupation. Portraits and genre scenes were created, such as weddings or hunting, but also sketches for the panorama of Groch√≥w. He refused to work for the Germans. He refused, among others painting the portrait of Hans Frank claiming the old age, despite the fact that the studio, where he talked to the German officer, was full of extravagant and completed paintings. One of his last works is Portrait of Zofia Jachimecka, Equestrian Portrait of Tadeusz Chutkowski, Stefan Skrzy≈Ñski, Tatar Jasyr, Kirasjer and girlfriend and Farys. On the day of his death - July 29, 1942 - he asked that paint be put on the palette, but he could not get up again. He did not realize that death was coming. In the evening, until the last moment, remaining conscious, he died surrounded by family. Work Wojciech Kossak's historical painting was different in style from that of his predecessor Jan Matejko. He belonged to a new generation of Polish battle-scene artists influenced by the work of his father Juliusz. However, like Matejko, he is known for depicting the history of Polish armed struggle and notable Polish battles of Central and Eastern Europe against foreign oppressors. Among his most famous paintings is The Rac≈Çawice Panorama.

Although allergens differ among patients, the most common cause is hay fever. Symptoms consist of redness (mainly due to vasodilation of the peripheral small blood vessels), edema (swelling) of the conjunctiva, itching, and increased lacrimation (production of tears). If this is combined with rhinitis, the condition is termed allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC). The symptoms are due to release of histamine and other active substances by mast cells, which stimulate dilation of blood vessels, irritate nerve endings, and increase secretion of tears. Treatment of allergic conjunctivitis is by avoiding the allergen (e.g., avoiding grass in bloom during \\"hay fever season\\") and treatment with antihistamines, either topical (in the form of eye drops), or systemic (in the form of tablets). Antihistamines, medications that stabilize mast cells, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are generally safe and usually effective. Signs and symptoms The conjunctiva is a thin membrane that covers the eye. When an allergen irritates the conjunctiva, common symptoms that occur in the eye include: ocular itching, eyelid swelling, tearing, photophobia, watery discharge, and foreign body sensation (with pain). Itching is the most typical symptom of ocular allergy, and more than 75% of patients report this symptom when seeking treatment. Symptoms are usually worse for patients when the weather is warm and dry, whereas cooler weather with lower temperatures and rain tend to assuage symptoms. Signs in phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis include small yellow nodules that develop over the cornea, which ulcerate after a few days. A study by Klein et al. showed that in addition to the physical discomfort allergic conjunctivitis causes, it also alters patients' routines, with patients limiting certain activities such as going outdoors, reading, sleeping, and driving. Therefore, treating patients with allergic conjunctivitis may improve their everyday quality of life. Causes The cause of allergic conjunctivitis is an allergic reaction of the body's immune system to an allergen. Allergic conjunctivitis is common in people who have other signs of allergic disease such as hay fever, asthma and eczema. Among the most common allergens that cause conjunctivitis are: * Pollen from trees, grass and ragweed * Animal skin and secretions such as saliva * Perfumes * Cosmetics * Skin medicines * Air pollution * Smoke * Dust mites * Balsam of Peru (used in food and drink for flavoring, in perfumes and toiletries for fragrance, and in medicine and pharmaceutical items for healing properties) * Eye drops (A reaction to preservatives in eye drops can cause toxic conjunctivitis) * Contact lens solution (some preservatives can irritate the eye over time resulting in conjunctivitis) * Contact lens (conjunctivitis is also caused by repeated mechanical irritation of the conjunctiva by contact lens wearers) Most cases of seasonal conjunctivitis are due to pollen and occur in the hay fever season, grass pollens in early summer and various other pollens and moulds may cause symptoms later in the summer. Pathophysiology Eye with mild allergic conjunctivitis The ocular allergic response is a cascade of events that is coordinated by mast cells. Beta chemokines such as eotaxin and MIP-1 alpha have been implicated in the priming and activation of mast cells in the ocular surface. When a particular allergen is present, sensitization takes place and prepares the system to launch an antigen specific response. TH2 differentiated T cells release cytokines, which promote the production of antigen specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE then binds to IgE receptors on the surface of mast cells. Then, mast cells release histamine, which then leads to the release of cytokines, prostaglandins, and platelet-activating factor. Mast cell intermediaries cause an allergic inflammation and symptoms through the activation of inflammatory cells. When histamine is released from mast cells, it binds to H1 receptors on nerve endings and causes the ocular symptom of itching. Histamine also binds to H1 and H2 receptors of the conjunctival vasculature and causes vasodilatation. Mast cell-derived cytokines such as chemokine interleukin IL-8 are involved in recruitment of neutrophils. TH2 cytokines such as IL-5 recruit eosinophils and IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13, which promote increased sensitivity. Immediate symptoms are due to the molecular cascade. Encountering the allergen a patient is sensitive to leads to increased sensitization of the system and more powerful reactions. Advanced cases can progress to a state of chronic allergic inflammation. Diagnosis=ClassificationSAC and PAC= Both seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) are two acute allergic conjunctival disorders. SAC is the most common ocular allergy. Symptoms of the aforementioned ocular diseases include itching and pink to reddish eye(s). These two eye conditions are mediated by mast cells. Nonspecific measures to ameliorate symptoms include cold compresses, eyewashes with tear substitutes, and avoidance of allergens. Treatment consists of antihistamine, mast cell stabilizers, dual mechanism anti-allergen agents, or topical antihistamines. Corticosteroids are another option, but, considering the side-effects of cataracts and increased intraocular pressure, corticosteroids are reserved for more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC). =VKC and AKC= Both vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) are chronic allergic diseases wherein eosinophils, conjunctival fibroblasts, epithelial cells, mast cells, and TH2 lymphocytes aggravate the biochemistry and histology of the conjunctiva. VKC is a disease of childhood and is prevalent in males living in warm climates. AKC is frequently observed in males between the ages of 30 and 50. VKC and AKC can be treated by medications used to combat allergic conjunctivitis or the use of steroids. Maxwell-Lyons sign, shield ulcer, cobblestones papillae, gelatinous thickening at the limbus, and Horner-Trantas dots are specific features of vernal type. =Giant papillary conjunctivitis= Giant papillary conjunctivitis is not a true ocular allergic reaction and is caused by repeated mechanical irritation of the conjunctiva. Repeated contact with the conjunctival surface caused by the use of contact lenses is associated with GPC. =PKC= Phlyctenular keratoconjunctiviti (PKC) results from a delayed hypersensitivity/inflammatory reaction to antigens expressed by various pathogens. Common agents include Staph. aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia and Candida. Management A detailed history allows doctors to determine whether the presenting symptoms are due to an allergen or another source. Diagnostic tests such as conjunctival scrapings to look for eosinophils are helpful in determining the cause of the allergic response. Antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers or dual activity drugs are safe and usually effective. Corticosteroids are reserved for more severe cases of inflammation, and their use should be monitored by an optometrist due to possible side-effects. When an allergen is identified, the person should avoid the allergen as much as possible. Non-pharmacological methods If the allergen is encountered and the symptoms are mild, a cold compress or artificial tears can be used to provide relief. Mast cell stabilizers Mast cell stabilizers can help people with allergic conjunctivitis. They tend to have delayed results, but they have fewer side-effects than the other treatments and last much longer than those of antihistamines. Some people are given an antihistamine at the same time so that there is some relief of symptoms before the mast cell stabilizers becomes effective. Doctors commonly prescribe lodoxamide and nedocromil as mast cell stabilizers, which come as eye drops. A mast cell stabilizer is a class of non-steroid controller medicine that reduces the release of inflammation-causing chemicals from mast cells. They block a calcium channel essential for mast cell degranulation, stabilizing the cell, thus preventing the release of histamine. Decongestants may also be prescribed. Another common mast cell stabilizer that is used for treating allergic conjunctivitis is sodium cromoglicate. Antihistamines Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine are commonly used as treatment. People treated with H1 antihistamines exhibit reduced production of histamine and leukotrienes as well as downregulation of adhesion molecule expression on the vasculature which in turn attenuates allergic symptoms by 40‚Äì50%. Dual Activity Agents Dual-action medications are both mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines. They are the most common prescribed class of topical anti allergy agent. Olopatadine (Patanol, Pazeo) and ketotifen fumarate (Alaway or Zaditor) are both commonly prescribed. Ketotifen is available without a prescription in some countries. Corticosteroids Ester based ‚Äúsoft‚Äù steroids such as loteprednol (Alrex) are typically sufficient to calm inflammation due to allergies, and carry a much lower risk of adverse reactions than amide based steroids. A systematic review of 30 trials, with 17 different treatment comparisons found that all topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers included for comparison were effective in reducing symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. There was not enough evidence to determine differences in long-term efficacy among the treatments. Many of the eye drops can cause burning and stinging, and have side-effects. Proper eye hygiene can improve symptoms, especially with contact lenses. Avoiding precipitants, such as pollen or mold can be preventative. Immunotherapy Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to substances that are generally harmless (pollen, house dust mites), thereby inducing specific long- term tolerance.Van Overtvelt L. et al. Immune mechanisms of allergen-specific sublingual immunotherapy. Revue fran√ßaise d‚Äôallergologie et d‚Äôimmunologie clinique. 2006; 46: 713‚Äì720. Allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous). Discovered by Leonard Noon and John Freeman in 1911, allergy immunotherapy represents the only causative treatment for respiratory allergies. Experimental research has targeted adhesion molecules known as selectins on epithelial cells. These molecules initiate the early capturing and margination of leukocytes from circulation. Selectin antagonists have been examined in preclinical studies, including cutaneous inflammation, allergy and ischemia-reperfusion injury. There are four classes of selectin blocking agents: (i) carbohydrate based inhibitors targeting all P-, E-, and L-selectins, (ii) antihuman selectin antibodies, (iii) a recombinant truncated form of PSGL-1 immunoglobulin fusion protein, and (iv) small-molecule inhibitors of selectins. Most selectin blockers have failed phase II/III clinical trials, or the studies were ceased due to their unfavorable pharmacokinetics or prohibitive cost. Sphingolipids, present in yeast like Saccharomyces cerevisiae and plants, have also shown mitigative effects in animal models of gene knockout mice. Epidemiology Allergic conjunctivitis occurs more frequently among those with allergic conditions, with the symptoms having a seasonal correlation. Allergic conjunctivitis is a frequent condition as it is estimated to affect 20 percent of the population on an annual basis and approximately one-half of these people have a personal or family history of atopy. Giant papillary conjunctivitis accounts for 0.5‚Äì1.0% of eye disease in most countries.

Early life Born in Detroit to a Japanese-Hawaiian father and a Chicano mother, Nishita moved with his family to Los Angeles, California when he was six. Career His first album Mark's Keyboard Repair (1995), was made up of keyboard driven pop-funk songs recorded at demo quality. Guy Ritchie used a song from the album in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. MKR was followed up by the Third Version EP in 1996 and Push the Button in 1998, for which Mark received critical praise. Whereas his 1996 EP was similar to his debut, Push the Button was extremely eclectic, combining aspects of rock music and pop with soul, funk and hip hop. This LP was met with good reviews, as was his 2001 follow up Change is Coming which had a tropical yet danceable disco and funk sound. Mark met the Beastie Boys during their migration to the West Coast, through mutual friend Mario Caldato Jr., who asked Mark (who was working as a carpenter) to fix the wooden gate at the entrance of the property where the band were staying when they were recording Paul's Boutique. He helped them build a studio, and quickly became a principal collaborator. He performed, wrote, and collaborated on every Beastie Boys album from 1992's Check Your Head to the group's final album, 2011's Hot Sauce Committee Part Two. Mark co-authored the Grammy Award winning album The Mix- Up. Money Mark contributed the keyboard phrase that opens and underpins \\"Where It's At\\" from Beck's 1996 album, Odelay. He played keyboards on tour for the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Quintet in support of their self-titled album. He has since become a full member of the quintet, appearing on the live EP with Damo Suzuki called Please Heat This Eventually and several other albums, with his debut full-length collaboration with the group being the Quintet's second LP release, The Apocalypse Inside of an Orange. In 1996, Money Mark contributed the song \\"Use Your Head (Use A Sua Cabeca)\\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot Organization. He also contributed songs to Red Hot's Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin and Red Hot + Rhapsody a tribute to George Gershwin. In 2004 Mark scored and played all instruments for HBO's first ever documentary prime time series, \\"Family Bond's,\\" directed by Steve Santor. In that same year, Mark also contributed original songs and score cues for \\"Along Came Polly,\\" \\"Fun With Dick and Jane,\\" and \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" In September 2006, Money Mark signed to Jack Johnson's Brushfire Records label. Brand New By Tomorrow, his first album with Brushfire, was released in February 2007. In late 2006, he opened for Gnarls Barkley at the Riviera Theatre in Chicago. In 2007, Money Mark and The Woodrow Jackson Orchestra recorded a cover version of Love Unlimited Orchestra's \\"Love's Theme\\" for Engine Room Recordings' compilation album Guilt by Association. Money Mark composed original music for the 2008 documentary film Beautiful Losers. Mark scored and played all instruments for HBO's first ever documentary prime time series, \\"Family Bond's,\\" directed by Steve Santor. In 2011, he contributed the Mario C. Remix of \\"Tropicali√°\\" with Beck and Seu Jorge, and played Hammond B-3 organ on \\"Look Around\\" from the Red Hot Chili Peppers album I'm With You, as well as a version of the song \\"Tropical Affair\\" with Thalma de Freitas and Jo√£o Parahyba for Red Hot Organization's most recent charitable album \\"Red Hot+Rio 2.\\" The album is a follow-up to the 1996 \\"Red Hot + Rio.\\" Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues. Mark scored the Slamdance Audience Award- winning and critically acclaimed documentary film, Getting Up: The Tempt One Story. Money Mark, working with Mike McCready and Stefan Lessard, contributed to many of the tracks used in the soundtrack to the 2011 film Horrible Bosses. He performed in 2011 with Karen O on her pop opera Stop the Virgens. Over the course of his career, Mark has done recording sessions with the Rolling Stones, Iggy Pop, Nile Rodgers, Yoko Ono, Carlos Santana, Lee Scratch Perry, and Jorge Ben, Dangermouse, Moby, Mixmaster Mike, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Seu Jorge, Jack Johnson, The Mars Volta. He is now on DVDASA, a podcast with David Choe and Asa Akira every Tuesday and Thursday. He is also part of the band Mangchi with David Choe and Steven Lee. In the spring of 2016, it was announced that Money Mark would be touring with The Claypool Lennon Delirium, a collaboration between Les Claypool and Sean Lennon. From the Prawn Song Newsletter, \\"Les Claypool and Sean Lennon‚Äôs newly formed band The Claypool Lennon Delirium will hit the road this summer for an extensive tour of the United States.

It is situated on the left bank of the Llobregat river. Es is a dialectal form of the masculine article el, hence Desp√≠ would be rendered Del pi in standard Catalan. Since 2006, the town has been the home of the FC Barcelona training ground and youth academy, the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper; in 2019, the club's Johan Cruyff Stadium for its reserve team opened adjacent to the training facility. Districts Currently, Sant Joan Desp√≠ has 31,438 inhabitants divided into 5 very disaggregated districts. It also has an industrial quarter.  Barri Centre  Barri Centre (Catalan for center quarter) is the original urban core of the town, formerly called Nucli antic (old town). The district is bounded by the railway, B-23 motorway, Cornell√† de Llobregat and by the new Eixample district towards the Llobregat River. It is full of Art Deco buildings, many of them designed by Josep Maria Jujol who was the official town council architect from 1926. It also contains the oldest buildings of the town including Esgl√®sia de Sant Joan Batista (Saint John the Baptist Church) and a small medieval chapel. In the 1960s, this quarter was still a small set of cottages, where wealthy people from Barcelona spent their holidays, and small houses, but since then, urban spread has changed a lot substituting most of the houses with tall buildings and changing the green spaces into concrete parks. Nowadays you can still find some of the old small houses, and most of the singular ones but they are surrounded by modern buildings.  Les Planes  Les Planes (Catalan for the plains) is a district which appeared during the 1960s and the 1970s to house the incoming immigration from other Spanish regions specially Extremadura and Andalusia. Les Planes is separated from the center quarter by the Pol√≠gon Fontsanta industrial quarter and from the TV3 quarter by the Parc Fontsanta park and indeed, it is urbanistically continuous just towards the Padr√≤ quarter of Cornell√† de Llobregat. This quarter is characterized by relatively tall buildings and narrow streets. Democratic councils have alleviated that by turning many of those streets into pedestrian streets.  Pla del Vent/Torreblanca  This district is placed at the other side of the B-23 motorway and to east of the railway. It is closer to Sant Feliu de Llobregat and Sant Just Desvern. This district has two names because is the union of two older quarters. Pla del Vent (Catalan for Wind Plane) was a set of small houses along a road communicating Sant Joan towards Sant Just Desvern. Torreblanca (Catalan for White Tower) was a new urbanization built during the last half of the 1980s besides the monumental Torreblanca Park which gave the name to the quarter. Later urbanizations joined both squares into a single district.  Residential Sant Joan (TV3)  This district was urbanized at the mid 1980s after the building of the main studios of the Catalan autonomic television, TV3, which is the reason why the quarter is popularly known as the 'TV3' quarter. It is a wealthy quarter surrounded by the large green zone called Fontsanta park which connects it with the Pol√≠gon Fontsanta and Les Planes.  Eixample  Eixample (Catalan for extension) is a new quarter, being built since 1998, during the real estate bubble in Spain, as an extension toward the Llobregat river of the Barri Centre.  Pol√≠gon Fontsanta  Pol√≠gon Fontsanta is an industrial district which is in the geographic center of Sant Joan Desp√≠. For many years, such polygon was the attracting factor for new population to the town, which explains why new quarters were built around it instead of around the old town. Important brands had their factories in the square including Gallina Blanca, San Miguel, Trinaranjus... Transportation The town is communicated with Barcelona downtown through several public transport: Bus * TMB: 63, 157, 78 * EMT- AMB: L10, L46, L52 * Nitbus: N12, N15 (night service) Train * Rodalies de Catalunya: R1, R4 Tram * Trambaix: T1, T2, T3  Demography References * Panareda Clop√©s, Josep Maria; Rios Calvet, Jaume; Rabella Vives, Josep Maria (1989).

The event was celebrated by another conference on its centenary in 1993. This led to a new series of conferences under the official title Parliament of the World's Religions with the same goal of trying to create a global dialogue of faiths. Organization An organization was incorporated in 1988 to carry out the tradition of the Parliament of the World's Religions by marking the centennial of the first Parliament. The Council for a Parliament of the World's ReligionsParliamentofReligions.org, Official Site is headquartered in Chicago. Its board of trustees are elected from various faith communities. History=1893 Parliament Swami Vivekananda on the platform of the Parliament of Religions September 1893. On the platform (left to right) Virchand Gandhi, Anagarika Dharmapala, Swami Vivekananda, G. Bonet Maury and Nikola Tesla. In 1893, the city of Chicago hosted the World Columbian Exposition, an early world's fair. So many people were coming to Chicago from all over the world that many smaller conferences, called Congresses and Parliaments, were scheduled to take advantage of this unprecedented gathering. One of these was the World's Parliament of Religions, an initiative of the Swedenborgian layman (and judge) Charles Carroll Bonney.Marcus Braybrooke, Charles Bonney and the Idea for a World Parliament of Religions, The Interfaith ObserverBoston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology, World Parliament of Religions (1893) The Parliament of Religions was by far the largest of the congresses held in conjunction with the Exposition. John Henry Barrows, a clergyman, was appointed as the first chairman of the General Committee of the 1893 Parliament by Charles Bonney.Michaud, Derek. An Analysis of Culture and Religion People.bu.edu. 14 April 2012. The Parliament of Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at the World's Congress Auxiliary Building which is now The Art Institute of Chicago, and ran from 11 to 27 September, making it the first organized interfaith gathering.\\"Parliament of the World‚Äôs Religions\\", Religion & Ethics Newsweekly, 23 October 2015 Today it is recognized as the occasion of the birth of formal interreligious dialogue worldwide, with representatives of a wide variety of religions and new religious movements, including: * The Jain preacher Virchand Gandhi was invited as a representative of Jainism. Virchand talked about the doctrines of Jainism- code of conduct, way of life and cosmology in such an eloquent and coherent manner that Buffalo Courier, an American newspaper reported, \\"of all Eastern scholars, it was this youth whose lectures on Jain Faith and Conduct was listened to with the greatest interest and attention.\\" * The Buddhist preacher Anagarika Dharmapala was invited as a representative of \\"Southern Buddhism\\", the term applied at that time to the Theravada. * Soyen Shaku, the \\"First American Ancestor\\" of Zen, made the trip. * An essay by the Japanese Pure Land master Kiyozawa Manshi, \\"Skeleton of the philosophy of religion\\" was read in his absence. * Swami Vivekananda, an Indian monk, represented Hinduism as a delegate, introducing Hinduism at the opening session of the Parliament on 11 September. Though initially nervous, he bowed to Saraswati, then began his speech with salutation, \\"Sisters and brothers of America!\\". To these words he got a standing ovation from a crowd of thousands, which lasted for two minutes. When silence was restored he began his address. He greeted the youngest of the nations on behalf of \\"the most ancient order of monks in the world, the Vedic order of sannyasins, a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance!\\" * Christianity was represented by G. Bonet Maury who was a Protestant historian invited by Swami Vivekananda * Septimus J. Hanna read an address written by the founder of Christian Science, Mary Baker Eddy.Peel, Robert (1977). Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery. New York: Holt, Rineheart and Winston, p. 51. * Islam was represented by Mohammed Alexander Russell Webb, an Anglo- American convert to Islam and the former US ambassador to the Philippines. * Rev. Henry Jessup addressing the World Parliament of Religions was the first to publicly discuss the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the United States (it had previously been known in Europe). Since then Bah√° º√≠s have become active participants. * Theism or the Brahmo Samaj was represented by Pratap Chandra Majumdar. * The Theosophical Society was represented by the Vice-President of the society, William Quan Judge and by activist Annie Besant. * Other New religious movements of the time, such as Spiritualism, were also represented. Absent from this event were Native American religious figures, Sikhs and other Indigenous and Earth-centered religionists; these religions and spiritual traditions were not represented until the 1993 Parliament convened. 1993 Parliament Opening Ceremony 1993 In 1993, the Parliament convened at the Palmer House hotel in Chicago. Over 8,000 people from all over the world, from many diverse religions, gathered to celebrate, discuss and explore how religious traditions can work together on the critical issues which confront the world. A document, \\"Towards a Global Ethic: An Initial Declaration\\", mainly drafted by Hans K√ºng, set the tone for the subsequent ten days of discussion. This global ethic was endorsed by many of the attending religious and spiritual leaders who were part of the parliament assembly. Also created for the 1993 parliament was a book, A Sourcebook for the Community of Religions, by the late Joel Beversluis, which has become a standard textbook in religion classes. Unlike most textbooks of religion, each entry was written by members of the religion in question. The keynote address was given by the 14th Dalai Lama on the closing day of the assembly. Cardinal Joseph Bernardin also participated. 1999 Parliament More than 7,000 individuals from over 80 countries attended 1999 Parliament in Cape Town, South Africa. The Parliament began with a showing of the international AIDS Memorial Quilt to highlight the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa, and of the role that religious and spiritual traditions play in facing the critical issues that face the world. The event continued with hundreds of panels, symposia and workshops, offerings of prayer and meditation, plenaries and performances. The programs emphasized issues of religious, spiritual, and cultural identity, approaches to interreligious dialogue, and the role of religion in response to the critical issues facing the world today. The Parliament Assembly considered a document called A Call to Our Guiding Institutions, addressed to religion, government, business, education, and media inviting these institutions to reflect on and transform their roles at the threshold of the next century. In addition to the Call, the Parliament staff had created a book, Gifts of Service to the World, showcasing over 300 projects considered to be making a difference in the world. The Assembly members also deliberated about Gifts of Service which they could offer or could pledge to support among those projects gathered in the Gifts document. 2004 Parliament It was celebrated in the Universal Forum of Cultures. More than 8,900 individuals attended the 2004 Parliament in Barcelona, Spain. Having created the declaration Towards a Global Ethic at the 1993 Parliament and attempted to engage guiding institutions at the 1999 Parliament, the 2004 Parliament concentrated on four pressing issues: mitigating religiously motivated violence, access to safe water, the fate of refugees worldwide, and the elimination of external debt in developing countries. Those attending were asked to make a commitment to a \\"simple and profound act\\" to work on one of these issues. 2009 Parliament Melbourne, Australia, hosted the 2009 Parliament of the World's Religions. The 2009 parliament took place from 3 December to 9 December. Over 6,000 people attended the parliament. The Melbourne parliament addressed issues of Aboriginal reconciliation. The issues of sustainability and global climate change were explored through the lens of indigenous spiritualities. Environmental issues and the spirituality of youth were also key areas of dialogue. The Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions suggested that the Melbourne parliament would \\"educate participants for global peace and justice\\" through exploring religious conflict and globalization, creating community and cross-cultural networks and addressing issues of religious violence. It supported \\"strengthening religious and spiritual communities\\" by providing a special focus on indigenous and Aboriginal spiritualities; facilitating cooperation between Pagan, Jewish, Christian, Bah√° º√≠, Jain, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh and Hindu communities; crafting new responses to religious extremism and confronting homegrown terrorism and violence. The Rev. Dirk Ficca served as the executive director at the time of the 2009 Parliament of Religions. Zabrina Santiago served as deputy director and partner cities director. 2015 Parliament In 2011, The Parliament of World's Religions announced that the 2014 Parliament would take place in Brussels, Belgium. In November 2012, a joint statement from Brussels and CPWR announced that because of the financial crisis in Europe, Brussels was unable to raise the funds required for a Parliament. On 15‚Äì19 October, the 2015 Parliament took place at the Salt Palace Convention Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. 9,806 attendees, performers, and volunteers from 73 countries, 30 major religions and 548 sub- traditions participated in the Parliament. During the closing ceremony, Imam Abdul Malik Mujahid announced that the Parliament would henceforth be held every two years, with the next gathering scheduled for 2017.Parliament of the World's Religions in Salt Lake 'best ever,' chairman says.

Among his properties were the famed Mir Castle Complex and Verkiai Palace. Life and career He was the eldest child of the celebrated German-Russian field marshal, Peter, 1st Prince of Sayn- Wittgenstein-Berleburg-Ludwigsburg.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, F√ºrstliche H√§user XV. \\"Sayn u. Wittgenstein\\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 1997, pp. 263, 628. (German). . Ludwig was half-Polish through his mother, Antonia C√§cilie Snarska (1778‚Äì1856), and was formally known in Russian as Lev Petrovich Vitgenshtein. In 1821, he represented Russia at the coronation of King George IV of the United Kingdom, but his career came to a halt when his participation in the Decembrist societies was revealed in 1826. He secured a pardon through the intervention of his influential father. On 1 May 1834, Ludwig's father was raised by King Frederick William III of Prussia from an Imperial Count to Prince of (F√ºrst zu) Sayn and Wittgenstein in the Kingdom of Prussia, where the family's mediatized German domain was located. He was also incorporated into the Russian nobility as a prince on 16 June 1834, where his family had been domiciled for two generations.

Depending on the condition being treated, they may contain steroids, antihistamines, sympathomimetics, beta receptor blockers, parasympathomimetics, parasympatholytics, prostaglandins, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, antifungals, or topical anesthetics. Eye drops sometimes do not have medications in them and are only lubricating and tear-replacing solutions. Eye drops have less of a risk of side effects than do oral medicines, and such risk can be minimized by occluding the lacrimal punctum (i.e. pressing on the inner corner of the eye) for a short while after instilling drops. Eye drops are also used for stopping itching and redness of the eyes. Prior to the development of single-use pre-loaded sterile plastic applicators, eye drops were administered using an eye dropper, a glass pipette with a rubber bulb.  Shelf life  Although most bottles of eye drops contain preservatives to inhibit contamination once opened, these will not prevent contamination indefinitely. Ophthamologists recommend disposing of bottles no longer than four weeks after opening. Eye drops that contain no preservatives are usually packaged in single-use tubes. Dispensers typically oversize the drops; the human eye can only handle about 25 microlitres.  Types and uses  Different pharmacological classes of eye drops can be recognized by patients by their different colored tops. For instance, the tops to dilating drops are a different color than anti-allergy drops. Rinse eye drops Eyes drops sometimes do not have medications in them and are only lubricating and tear-replacing solutions. Drug administrationDry eyes= There is a wide variety of artificial tear eye drops that provide different surface healing strategies. One can find bicarbonate ions, hypotonicity, viscosity, and non-preserved types. They all act differently and therefore, one may have to try different artificial tears to find the one that works the best. =Steroid and antibiotic eye drops= Steroid and antibiotic eye drops are used to treat eye infections. They also have prophylactic properties and are used to prevent infections after eye surgeries. They should be used for the entire time prescribed without interruptions. The infection may relapse if the use of the medication is stopped. =Glaucoma= Eye drops used in managing glaucoma help the eye's fluid to drain better and decrease the amount of fluid made by the eye which decreases eye pressure. They are classified by their active ingredient and they include: prostaglandin analogs, beta blockers, alpha agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. There are also combination drugs available for those patients who require more than one type of medication. =Allergies= Some eye drops may contain histamine antagonists or nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), which suppress the optical mast cell responses to allergens including (but not limited to) aerosolized dust particles. =Pink eye= Antibiotic eye drops are prescribed when conjunctivitis is caused by bacteria but not when it is caused by a virus. In the case of allergic conjunctivitis, artificial tears can help dilute irritating allergens present in the tear film. =Mydriatic eye drops= These make the eye's pupil widen to maximum, to let an optometrist have the best view inside the eyeball behind the iris. Afterwards in sunny weather they can cause dazzling and photophobia until the effect of the mydriatic has worn off. In Russia, Tropicamide, a mydriatic eye drop, is used to some degree as an inexpensive recreational drug. Like other anticholinergics, when taken recreationally, tropicamide acts as a deliriant. According to one reporter, when injected intravenously, as is most often the case, the drug often \\"brings on suicidal feelings\\". Injectable medication Syringe designed saline drops (e.g. Wallace Cameron Ultra Saline Minipod) are distributed in modern needle-exchange programmes as they can be used efficiently either by injection or ophthalmic (if the drug is potent in small doses) route of administer which is compared to intravenous use; by demonstration, the elimination of latanoprost acid from plasma is rapid (half-life 17 minutes) after either ophthalmic or intravenous administration. Side effects Man applying eye drops Steroid and antibiotic eye drops may cause stinging for one or two minutes when first used and if stinging continues, medical advice should be sought. Also, one should tell their doctor if vision changes occur or if they experience persistent sore throat, fever, easy bleeding or bruising when using drops with chloramphenicol. Also, one should be aware of symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as: rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, and trouble breathing. Prostaglandin analogs may cause changes in iris color and eyelid skin, growth of eyelashes, stinging, blurred vision, eye redness, itching, and burning. Beta blockers' side effects include low blood pressure, reduced pulse rate, fatigue, shortness of breath, and in rare occasions, reduced libido and depression. Alpha agonists can cause burning or stinging, fatigue, headache, drowsiness, dry mouth and nose, and also they have a higher likelihood of allergic reaction. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may cause stinging, burning, and eye discomfort.

It is named for Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737‚Äì1832), a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Design and construction In 1847, the State of Maryland gave permission to the United States War Department to construct a fort in the shallow water of Soller's Point Flats to protect the city of Baltimore. Fort Carroll was important for the defense of Baltimore‚Äîbefore the fort's construction, Fort McHenry just outside the city was the only military defensive structure between Baltimore and the Chesapeake Bay. The fort was part of the \\"Permanent System\\" or Third System construction program, which aimed to defend America's most important ports., at Maryland Historical Trust Then Brevet-Colonel Robert E. Lee designed the hexagonal structure and supervised the construction, which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers commenced in 1848. The fort received its name on 8 October 1850. In 1852, Lee left Baltimore to become Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point. In 1853 a lighthouse, now abandoned, was built on the ramparts to aid navigation into Baltimore Harbor. In 1898 a new lighthouse was built, the one still seen today. It was automated in 1920 and discontinued operations before 1945. The original design foresaw the fort being armed with some 225 cannon on three levels. However, in April 1861 at the outbreak of the Civil War, Fort Carroll's walls were still less than half the planned height of thirty feet. Only five gun platforms were ready and only two were armed with guns. Still, the Army emplaced about thirty cannon and manned the fort throughout the war. In April 1864 torrential rains flooded the fort's magazines, which led the Army to move all the powder and ammunition to Fort McHenry. An updated topographical blueprint of the fort, based on documents from 1914 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War When the United States entered into the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, the Army again manned the fort's batteries, which were by then completely obsolete. The Army therefore commenced the construction of modern concrete gun emplacements following the designs of the Endicott Board. The Army created three batteries: Battery TowsonThe battery was named in honor of Major General Nathan Towson, U.S. Army. He had served in the War of 1812 and the Mexican War and died July 20, 1854 at Washington, District of Columbia. (two 12\\" barbette carriage guns), Battery HeartThe battery was named in honor of Major Jonathan Heart, 2nd U.S. Infantry, who served during the Revolutionary War. He died on 4 November 1791 in action with Indians near Fort Recovery, Ohio. (two 5-inch M1897 guns on balanced pillar mounts) and Battery AugustinBattery Augustin was named in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Joseph N. Augustin, Jr., 24th U.S. Infantry, who died 2 July 1898 of wounds he had received the day before at the Battle of San Juan Hill. (two 3\\" balanced pedestal-mount guns). Fort Carroll from Fort Armistead The new batteries were ready by September 1900, well after the end of the war. They received their names on 30 March 1903. World War I and abandonment After World War I broke out, in 1917 the Army removed the guns from Battery Heart and in 1918 those from Battery Towson to use elsewhere. By 1920, all guns had been removed from the fort. In March 1921 the Army officially abandoned Fort Carroll and moved whatever military equipment was left to nearby Fort Howard. The War Department declared the island excess property in 1923, but took no immediate steps to sell the land. A variety of proposals for the use of the island were advanced, including a prison, as well as a 1923 plan advanced by Baltimore mayor William Broening to place an electric \\"Welcome to Baltimore\\" sign on the island, accompanied by a statue of Lord Baltimore. In World War II the Army used the fort as a firing range. It also served as a checkpoint for vessels. In May 1958, Baltimore attorney Benjamin Eisenberg purchased the island for , intending to put a casino there, but development plans never materialized. The fort is now deserted and the habitat for various animals. It is also a site for occasional urban explorations. In 2013, Preservation Maryland placed Fort Carroll on its list of threatened historic properties. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

He was, therefore, a younger half-brother of King Edward II (1307‚Äì1327) and a full brother of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent. He occupied the office of Earl Marshal of England. Early life Thomas of Brotherton was born 1 June 1300 at the manor house at Brotherton, Yorkshire, while his mother was on her way to Cawood, where her confinement was scheduled to take place.He was born in the main house, later demolished in the 1930s due to disrepair, although the new 17th century wing still exists. Waugh, 2004. According to Hilton, Margaret was staying at Pontefract Castle and was following a hunt when she went into labour. The chronicler William Rishanger records that during the difficult delivery his mother prayed, as was the custom at the time, to Thomas Becket, and Thomas of Brotherton was thus named after the saint and his place of birth. King Edward I hastened to the queen and the newborn baby and had Thomas presented with two cradles. His brother Edmund of Woodstock was born in the year after that. They were overseen by wet nurses until they were six years old. Like their parents, they learned to play chess and to ride horses. They were visited by nobles and their half-sister Mary of Woodstock, who was a nun. Their mother often accompanied their father on his campaigns to Scotland, but kept herself well-informed on their well-being. Thomas's father died when he was 7 years old. Thomas's half-brother Edward, became king of England, as \\"King Edward II\\", and Thomas was heir presumptive until his nephew, the future King Edward III, was born in 1312. The Earldom of Cornwall had been intended for Thomas, but his brother the King instead bestowed it upon his favourite, Piers Gaveston, in 1306. When Thomas was 10 years old, King Edward II assigned to him and his brother Edmund, the estates of Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, who had died without heirs in 1306. Career Abbey of Bury St Edmunds where Thomas of Brotherton was buried In 1312, Thomas was titled \\"Earl of Norfolk\\" by Edward II, and on 10 February 1316 he was created Earl Marshal. While his brother was away fighting in Scotland, he was left Keeper of England. He was known for his hot and violent temper. He was one of the many victims of the unchecked greed of the king's new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the Elder, who stole some of the young earl's lands. He allied himself with Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer when they invaded England in 1326, and stood as one of the judges in the trials against both Despensers. When his nephew Edward III reached his majority and took the government into his own hands Thomas, who had helped with the deposition, became one of his principal advisors. It was in the capacity of Lord Marshal that he commanded the right wing of the English army at the Battle of Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333. Thomas died about 20 September 1338, and was buried in the choir of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds.Thomas F. Tout, (1886) \\"Thomas of Brotherton\\" in Dictionary of National Biography As he had no surviving sons, Thomas was succeeded by his daughter, Margaret, as Countess of Norfolk. She was later created Duchess of Norfolk for life in 1397. As a son of Edward I of England, Thomas was entitled to bear the coat of arms of the Kingdom of England, differenced by a label argent of three points.Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family Marriages and issue Thomas married firstly, before 8 January 1326, Alice de Hales (d. before 12 October 1330), daughter of Sir Roger de Hales of Hales Hall in Loddon in Roughton, Norfolk, a coroner, by his wife, Alice, by whom he had a son and two daughters: *Edward of Norfolk, who married Beatrice de Mortimer, daughter of Roger de Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, but died without issue before 9 August 1334. *Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, who married firstly John Segrave, 4th Baron Segrave, and secondly Wauthier de Masny. *Alice of Norfolk, who married Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu.

Opening narrationPlot Professor Ellis Fowler is an elderly English literature teacher at the Rock Spring School, a boys' prep school in Vermont, who is forced into retirement after teaching for 51 years at the school. Looking through his old yearbooks and reminiscing about his former students, he becomes convinced that all of his lessons have been in vain and that he has accomplished nothing with his life. Deeply depressed, he prepares to kill himself on the night of Christmas Eve next to a statue of the famous educator Horace Mann, with its quote \\"Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.\\" Before he can follow through, however, he is called back to his classroom by a phantom bell, where he is visited by ghosts of several boys who were his students, all dead, some of whom died heroically. The boys tell him of how he inspired them to become better men, and the difference he made in their lives. One posthumously received the Medal of Honor for actions at Iwo Jima; another died of leukemia after exposure to X-Rays during research into cancer treatments; another died at Pearl Harbor after saving 12 other men. All were inspired by Fowler's teachings. Moved to tears, Fowler hears the phantom bell again, and his former pupils disappear. Now accepting of his retirement, content that his life is fuller for having enriched the lives of the boys, he listens to his current students caroling outside his home.

It was written in 1996 by Sam and Gary Francis for Utah's centennial celebrations. It replaced \\"Utah, We Love Thee\\" as the state song in 2003, after 4th grade students at Cook Elementary wanted a song that was fun to sing. The students talked to their local state representative, Dana Love, and she drafted a bill that passed the state legislature on 28 February 2003, and was signed by then Utah Governor Mike Leavitt on 15 March 2003. The previous song, \\"Utah, We Love Thee\\", became the State Hymn. This song was placed in the public domain by the composers when it was made the state song of Utah. However, the composer did not make an arrangement available to the public without charge. There is currently no written score that is available without purchasing from the composer. The song is referenced imprecisely in official publications variously by the names \\"Utah, This is the Place\\" and \\"Utah This is the Place\\".

It was probably produced in Rome in the 420s or 430s. It is the oldest surviving illustrated biblical manuscript and has been in the Berlin State Library since 1875-76. The pages are approximately 305 x 205 mm large.Weitzmann, 27 The fragments were found from 1865 onwards (two in 1865, two in 1867, one in 1887) re-used in the bindings of different books that had been bound in the 17th century in the town of Quedlinburg, home of Quedlinburg Abbey, a large Imperial monastery, where the manuscript may well have spent much of its life. The illustrations are grouped in framed miniatures occupying an entire page, with between two and five miniatures per page, with the corresponding text being on the other side of the pages; there are fourteen miniatures in total. One folio contains only text. The illustrations, although much damaged, are done in the illusionistic style of late antiquity.Calkins, 21; also Style and context Much of the paint surface is lost revealing the underlying writing that gives instructions to the artist who would execute the pictures, such as: \\"Make the tomb [by which] Saul and his servant stand and two men, jumping over pits, speak to him and [announce that the asses have been found]. Make Saul by a tree and [his] servant [and three men who talk] to him, one carrying three goats, one [three loaves of bread, one] a wine-skin.\\" This suggests that the programme of images was newly devised for this volume, rather than merely copying an earlier work. This, the usual conclusion, was disputed by Ernst Kitzinger, who argued that they were to aid the artist who was copying images from the different format of a scroll. However Walter Cahn sees the instructions as far more detailed than would be needed for that.Williams, 99 and Cahn, 22 thinks the designs are original, the latter describing Kitzinger's view in a different work from that cited here. Whether original or not, the images are \\"the fruit of what we must imagine to have been a thoroughly rationalized and quasi-industrial method of production\\", in \\"a stable craft with settled routines\\".Cahn, 22 They are painted in \\"an illusionistic style with an emphasis on imperial imagery\\" (Saul and David are dressed as emperors in military costume), and gold is used for highlights and the tituli or captions to the images.Williams, 99 (quoted); Kitzinger, 68, 71 The text is in a \\"superior uncial script\\", while the instructions to the artist are in \\"an eccentric Roman cursive\\".Williams, 99 The full extent of the original manuscript is not known. Some of the episodes illustrated are very minor, suggesting that the whole manuscript may have been illustrated at this density, which is greater than any later Biblical manuscript; according to Kurt Weitzmann \\"It staggers the imagination to picture what a fully illustrated manuscript of the two books of Samuel and the two books of Kings must have looked like\\". The style suggests it may have been made by the same workshop responsible for the Vergilius Vaticanus, and has links with the mosaics of Santa Maria Maggiore.Kitzinger, 68-72 (fullest comparison with the mosaics and Virgil MS); Weitzmann, 15, 40 (quoted); Williams, 99; Cahn, 22 According to Kitzinger: \\"Evidently this book was commissioned by a patron who belonged to the same social stratum as the sponsors of de luxe editions of the classics and who shared many of the same cultural values\\".Kitzinger, 71 The other very early illustrated biblical manuscripts that have survived are similar densely illustrated texts of specific books from the Old Testament, mostly the Book of Genesis (Vienna Genesis, Cotton Genesis), which, with some specific details of the illustrations, leads scholars to postulate an earlier tradition of Jewish luxury manuscripts, perhaps in scroll format, in the Hellenized Jewish world. The Books of Kings feature strongly in the uniquely extensive wall-paintings of the Dura-Europos Synagogue from the 3rd century.Weitzmann, 15 The figures have landscape backgrounds, \\"atmospheric, autumnal settings, with softly shaded skies of pink and light blue\\", that are \\"very close\\" to those of the Vergilius Vaticanus, whereas the Santa Maria Maggiore mosaics see the beginning of the use of a plain gold background in some scenes, the start of what was to become a very common feature in religious art for the next thousand years. But in many respects, the mosaics look (at the expense of visibility, given their high placement) like enlarged miniatures, just as the miniatures of both manuscripts draw on the styles of larger paintings.Kitzinger, 68-69 Saul and Samuel Scenes from Chapter 15 of 1 Samuel from the Quedlinburg Itala fragment (again) The fragment includes a full page with four miniatures illustrating the episode at 1 Samuel 15:13-33: Notes References  * Cahn, Walter, Romanesque Bible Illumination, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1982, * Calkins, Robert G.

The first game in the Mr. Do series, it was one of the first arcade games to be released as a conversion kit (by Taito), and went on to sell 30,000 units in the United States. Gameplay Mr. Do collecting cherries while avoiding Creeps. The object of Mr. Do! is to score as many points as possible by digging tunnels through the ground and collecting cherries. The title character, Mr. Do (a circus clown‚Äîexcept for the original Japanese version of the game, in which he is a snowman), is constantly chased by red monsters called creeps, and the player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by one. The game is over when the last life is lost. Cherries are distributed throughout the level in groups of eight. 500 bonus points are awarded if Mr. Do collects eight cherries in a row without stopping. A level is complete either when all cherries are removed, all creeps are destroyed, \\"EXTRA\\" is spelled, or a diamond is found. Mr. Do can defeat creeps by hitting them with his bouncing \\"power ball\\" or by dropping large apples on them. While the power ball is bouncing toward a creep, Mr. Do is defenseless. If the ball bounces into an area where there are no creeps to hit (such as behind a fallen apple), Mr. Do cannot use it again until he has retrieved it. When the power ball hits a creep, it then reforms in Mr. Do's hands after a delay that increases with each use. Mr. Do or the creeps can push an apple off the edge of a vertical tunnel and crush one or more creeps. If an apple falls more than its own height, it breaks and disappears. Mr. Do can also be crushed by a falling apple causing a loss of life. Occasionally, the creeps transform briefly into more powerful multicolored monsters that can tunnel through the ground. If one of these digs through a cherry, it leaves fewer cherries (and fewer points) for Mr. Do to collect. When it digs under an apple, it often crushes itself, other creeps, and/or Mr. Do. Each time the score passes a certain threshold during play (5000 points), a letter from the word \\"EXTRA\\" appears on the playfield as an Alphamonster, and the player can defeat or be defeated by this monster in the same way as a creep. Defeating an Alphamonster awards that letter to the player, and collecting all five letters of the word completes the level, goes to a cut scene playing the theme to Astro Boy, and awards the player an extra life. Alphamonsters attempt to eat any apples they encounter, which makes them difficult (but not impossible) to crush. The creeps spawn at the center of the screen. After they have all appeared, the generator will turn into a food item; picking this up scores bonus points, freezes all the creeps, and calls out an Alphamonster and three large blue monsters. The latter can eat apples as well. The creeps stay frozen (but still deadly) until the player either defeats all three blue monsters, defeats the Alphamonster (in which case any remaining blue monsters are turned into apples), loses a life, or completes the stage. Rarely, dropping an apple will reveal a diamond which, if collected within about 15 seconds, completes the level and awards a bonus credit to the player (as well as 8000 points), allowing him or her to play a free game. Development Mr. Do! was created by Kazutoshi Ueda. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Source Gaming. ). Ports Mr. Do! was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit family, ColecoVision, Apple II, MSX, Neo Geo, Tomy Tutor, and Commodore 64. A handheld LCD version was released by Tomy in 1983. In the ColecoVision adaptation, the alphamonster and sidekicks are unable to eat apples, making them easier to crush, but the blue monsters eat the shrubbery and cherries.

History Uchoten formed in Tokyo, Japan from the ruins of a band called Densenbyou. Densenbyou's last concert was 6 April 1982 and Uchoten's first concert the same day. They are led by vocalist Keralino Sandorovich, called Kera. Uchoten released their first album and singles on Kera's own independent record label, Nagomu. In 1985, they released Kokoro no tabi on a bigger indie label, Captain. It is a cover of a popular Japanese song from 1973, performed by Tulip. In those days, Uchoten, The Willard and Laughin' Nose were called the Indies Big Three. In September 1986 they released their major debut album, Peace. Peace has a theme of ending and death, and some worried that Uchoten were going to break up. But they lasted five more years, although with several member changes. Uchoten initially played their last concert 15 September 1991, a recording of which was later released on CD, Search For 1/3 Fin, until reuniting in 2015 after 24 years apart.

At the time of the introduction of this corps, professional soldiers who are its members should hold a secondary education matriculation. Virtually warrant were highly skilled technicians. The decision of the politicians who are motivated in their conduct by a lack of warrant officers in the armies of both NATO and others, the warrant officers corps was liquidated, dropping them to the NCO corps. Result was a marked change in the ratio between officers and NCOs standard-bearers. This decision is criticized, among others for the fact that according to some stakeholders the possibility of multiple standard-bearer was closed and education skills, because that decision is thought to be supportive of officers' responsibilities as including the planning and decision-making process(es), whereas that of non-commissioned officers include carrying out officers' orders.

Modern history In 1789 the Government of Bengal established a penal colony on Chatham Island in the southeast bay of Great Andaman, named Port Blair in the honour of Archibald Blair of the East India Company. After two years, the colony moved to the northeast part of Great Andaman and was named Port Cornwallis after Admiral William Cornwallis. However, there was much disease and death in the penal colony, and the government ceased operating it in May 1796. In 1824 Port Cornwallis was the rendezvous of the fleet carrying the army to the First Anglo-Burmese War. In the 1830s and 1840s, shipwrecked crews who landed on the Andamans were often attacked and killed by the natives, alarming the British government. In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a convict establishment, but the Indian Rebellion forced a delay in its construction. However, since the rebellion provided the British with a lot of new prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison an urgent necessity. Construction began in November 1857 at the renovated Port Blair, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp which seemed to have been the source of many of the old colony's problems. The penal colony was originally on Viper Island. The convicts, mostly political prisoners, suffered life imprisonment at hard labour under cruel and degrading conditions. Many were hanged, while others died of disease and starvation. Between 1864 and 1867 a penal establishment was also built with convict labour on the northern side of Ross Island. T. Ramakrishnan, \\"Notorious Once, It Stands Shrouded in Silence\\" These structures now lie in ruins.http://www.galenfrysinger.com/ross_island.htm Ross Island As the Indian freedom movement continued to grow in the late 19th century, the enormous Cellular Jail was constructed between 1896 and 1906 to house Indian convicts, mostly political prisoners, in solitary confinement. The Cellular Jail is also known as Kala Pani (translated as \\"Black Waters\\"), a name given to it due to the torture and general ill-treatment towards its Indian convicts. The airport at Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar's capital, has been named Veer Savarkar International Airport. The commemorative blue plaque on India House fixed by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England reads \\"Vinayak Damodar Savarkar 1883‚Äì1966 Indian patriot and philosopher lived here.\\" In World War II the islands were occupied by the Japanese on 23 March 1942 without opposition from the garrison. British forces returned to the islands in October 1945. From 1943‚Äì44 during World War II, Port Blair served as the headquarters of the Azad Hind government under Subhas Chandra Bose. Although affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Port Blair survived sufficiently to act as a base for relief efforts in the islands.

On Broad Street & Williams Street is another adaptive reuse called Williams Flats, featuring upscale apartments and ground floor retail space, and the Halston Flats was recently completed at Raymond Blvd & Halsey St which also is a conversion to upscale apts and ground floor retail space. Also under construction at the corner of Broad Street & Hill Street is an IHOP restaurant with five floors of market rate apartments on top. Teachers Village, which consists of 12 separate residential buildings and some businesses, was recently opened. The Ironside Newark complex is under construction adjacent to the brand new Mulberry Commons park, and M&M; Mars has signed leases for a few floors in the building. Some employees will be relocated there from the Chicago corporate headquarters. Several law firms and Edison Industries offices have also signed leases for space in the large building. It is scheduled for completion in several months. There are also two upscale residential developments in the planning stages, The Halo Tower, and The Vibe. There is also a new Passaic River waterfront park that stretches from the Jackson St bridge area north to Bridge St. There are many more developments either under construction or in the planning stages. Washington Park Aided by the presence of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, new apartments, and its proximity to the Newark's colleges and universities, including New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers-Newark, downtown has seen a variety of restaurants and bars open their doors in the past several years. In addition to several high end restaurants catering to the theater crowd, downtown Newark is home to two Irish pubs, a SoHo style bistro, a gourmet soup restaurant, and an increasing number of other establishments. Most buses pass through Downtown and it is a principal shopping district of most Newark area residents. Washington Street Station, Penn Station, Military Park Station and all the stops on the Newark Light Rail serve the downtown area. Interstate 280 lies just north of Downtown, running parallel to New Jersey Transit rail operations. The Main Library is on Washington Park and served by the Newark Light Rail.

The nearest major town is Coatbridge, to the east. History There was no village of Bargeddie before the 1930s when Lanark County Council built a housing estate at Dykehead. Before that the area consisted of a cluster of hamlets and villages such as Bartonshill, Braehead, and Dykehead, populated in the main by coal miners. In the 1950s, another housing estate was built around the site of Bargeddie House which was demolished after World War II. Bargeddie expanded as part of the overall Glasgow area expansion with the addition of the Drumpellier Lawns,Burnside View and The Fairways housing Developments. Present day Bargeddie is now populated by just over 6500 people. The village has two primary schools; Bargeddie Primary School and St. Kevins Primary School. The two schools formed a campus in 2008. Unfortunately there are very few job opportunities within the village. The Safety Zone is a well established and popular community project run by Elutheria Ltd, a group consisting of local volunteers. The centre offers activities for all ages from babies to elderly people and all stages in between. There are three shops in Bargeddie one at the front of the village, middle and back and a Community Centre which is locally known as \\"The Windsor\\" that also sits in Bargeddie. Just before coming to Coatbridge, there is a Showcase Complex which includes of Hollywood Bowl and Showcase Cinema. Transport The town is served by Bargeddie railway station. There are also bus stops which allow villagers to travel to Glasgow and Coatbridge. Bargeddie is served by three bus routes, one of which goes to Glasgow city centre, the 2. There is also a bus that stops at Bargeddie that can take villagers to Edinburgh. As of 2016 there is a bus run by McGill's Bus Services, that takes local villagers around the village and up to Coatbridge and Airdrie. Sport The most successful club within the village is Bargeddie Carpet Bowling Club, which has run on Tuesday evenings since 1981. The club was based in the Windsor Hall(now demolished), an old miners' welfare hall, now controlled by North Lanarkshire Council. The hall celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2008 with a party organised by Bargeddie Forward. Former Scottish football player and Arsenal manager George Graham was born in Bargeddie. Football remains an important part of life in the area. Bargeddie Amateur Football Club is well known in the Glasgow area but has been without a home pitch since their previous one, Bargeddie Pavilion, was destroyed by a fire in 2010. In 2009 \\"Bargeddie Colts\\" youth football team were reformed. By end of 2011 over 90 children between 5‚Äì12 years old were playing football in the \\"Monklands Soccer Sevens\\" leagues and the club had achieved SFA Quality Mark \\"Standard Award\\". Religion Bargeddie Parish Church is situated on Barton's Hill, a 10-minute walk from the village. There is also a small United Free Church on Langmuir Road.

Alliances are often bounded by a single agreement with equitable risk and opportunity share for all parties involved and are typically managed by an integrated project team. An example of this is code sharing in airline alliances. Types There are five basic categories or types of alliances: *Sales: A sales alliance occurs when two companies agree to go to market together to sell complementary products and services. *Solution-specific: A solution-specific alliance occurs when two companies agree to jointly develop and sell a specific marketplace solution. *Geographic-specific: A geographic-specific alliance is developed when two companies agree to jointly market or co-brand their products and services in a specific geographic region. *Investment: An investment alliance occurs when two companies agree to join their funds for mutual investment. *Joint venture: A joint venture is an alliance that occurs when two or more companies agree to undertake economic activity together. In many cases, alliances between companies can involve two or more categories or types of alliances.  Horizontal alliances  A type of an alliance is a horizontal alliance. For example, a horizontal alliance can occur between logistics service providers, i.e., the cooperation between two or more logistics companies that are potentially competing. In a horizontal alliance, these partners can benefit twofold. On one hand, they can \\"access tangible resources which are directly exploitable.\\" In this example extending common transportation networks, their warehouse infrastructure and the ability to provide more complex service packages can be achieved by combining resources. On the other hand, partners can \\"access intangible resources, which are not directly exploitable.\\" This typically includes know-how and information and, in turn, innovation.  Governance  Any alliance is susceptible to failures due to not achieving either cooperation or coordination, or both. Such inefficiencies originate from two well-known limitations in human nature, that are opportunism and bounded rationality. To enhance the success rate of alliances calls for proper levels of governance efforts. Contracts and relational norms are the two most commonly used governance mechanisms by business actors. They can also impact how business actors handle conflicts during the course of the focal collaboration as well as extend the current alliance to future collaborative relationships. Contractual and relational governance mechanisms have complex interactions, with one influencing the other's use and effectiveness in their different dimensions.

He took command of the VI Corps in May 1864 following the death of General John Sedgwick. In this capacity, he was responsible for building the fortifications around Washington DC, and in the Overland Campaign he commanded the first troops to break through the Confederate defenses at Petersburg. After the war, he was involved in a number of engineering projects, including the Brooklyn Bridge and the completion of the Washington Monument, and served as Chief of Engineers for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Early life Wright was born in Clinton, Connecticut,Eicher, p. 583. son of Edward and Nancy Wright. When he was 14 he entered Alden Partridge's military academy in Vermont (now Norwich University).Bergen, p. 88. In 1837 he entered West Point and graduated second in his class of 52 from the United States Military Academy in 1841 with a commission in the engineers. He taught engineering and French at West Point over the next several years. He was sent to Florida in 1846, where he spent ten years working on the harbor of St. Augustine and the defenses of Key West, including Fort Jefferson. In 1855, he was promoted to the rank of captain and served as assistant to Chief of Engineers Colonel Joseph G. Totten the following year. During this time, he was appointed as a member of a military committee to study iron carriages for the construction of naval guns and ordnance specifications of the 15-inch gun. He later co-wrote Report on Fabrication of Iron for Defenses (published in 1871-72) based on his time on the board. Civil War service After the start of the war, Wright took part in the evacuation and destruction of the Gosport Navy Yard (later named the Norfolk Navy Yard) on April 20, 1861, to prevent its exploitation by Confederate forces. He was captured during this action, but was released four days later. Wright began constructing fortifications around Washington, D.C., before being assigned to the 3rd Division of the Department of Northeast Virginia under Maj. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman. Serving as Chief Engineer of the 3rd Division during the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, Wright was promoted to major in August. Promoted to brigadier general of volunteers the following month, Wright was assigned as Chief Engineer to Maj. Gen. Thomas W. Sherman's November 1861 expedition against Port Royal, South Carolina. His successes while commanding Union troops in operations against Jacksonville, St. Augustine, and other military targets on the Florida coast from February to June 1862 led to his appointment as major general of volunteers and commander of the Department of the Ohio in August 1862, and commander of the newly created Army of the Ohio in March 1863. In this command he played a major logistical role in the repulse of Confederate General Braxton Bragg's invasion of Kentucky in 1862. His appointment as major general was not confirmed by the Senate and was revoked in March 1863. As a brigadier general, he was not considered eligible to command a department and Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside was sent to relieve him. Reporting to Burnside, Wright remained briefly as the commander of the District of Western Kentucky before returning to the East. General Wright in front of his tent. In May 1863, Wright was given command of the 1st Division in the VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick. His first battle in division command was Gettysburg in July 1863, where his corps was held in reserve. The corps saw action at Mine Run in November 1863, and the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5 to May 6, 1864. After General Sedgwick's death at Spotsylvania Court House on May 9, Wright assumed command of the VI Corps, receiving promotion as major general of volunteers (confirmed by the Senate this time) and brevet colonel in the regular army on May 12, 1864. Wright's corps fought at Cold Harbor from June 3 to June 12, 1864. In the Valley Campaigns of 1864, he was dispatched to Washington, D.C., to defend against Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal Early's raid on July 11 and July 12, 1864, commanding the Washington Emergency Defense Force, consisting of the VI, VIII, and XIX Corps. During the defense of Fort Stevens, he gained notoriety by inviting President Abraham Lincoln to join him on a parapet exposed to enemy fire. (A young staff officer, Oliver Wendell Holmes, is often said to be responsible for yelling at the president to get under cover. In George Thomas Stevens's post-war (1870) history of the VI Corps, Wright related to Thomas that he himself was the person who shouted at the president to get down.White, pp. 64, 506 (notes 62-66). Wright commanded the VI Corps again during Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign from August 6 to October 16, 1864. Wright directed fighting at Cedar Creek on October 19 before General Sheridan's arrival. In the Siege of Petersburg, the VI Corps was the first unit to break through the Confederate defenses, on April 2, 1865. Subsequently, operating under the command of Sheridan, it defeated Confederate forces at Sayler's Creek on April 6, 1865, resulting in the capture of a large number of Confederate soldiers, including Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell and Major General G. W. Custis Lee, son of Robert E. Lee.by Pvt. David D. White, 37th Massachusetts Infantry or Pvt.

Handy, c. 1873 During Reconstruction, Wright commanded the Army of Texas from July 1865 to August 1866. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of engineers in November, before leaving volunteer service in September 1866. He was involved in a number of engineering projects including the Brooklyn Bridge and the completion of the Washington Monument. Promoted to colonel in March 1879, Wright was later named Chief of Engineers as a brigadier general in June 1879. He retired at that rank on March 6, 1884, and lived in Washington, D.C., until his death in 1899. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery under an obelisk erected by veterans of the VI Corps, facing the Washington Monument he completed. The city of Fort Wright, Kentucky, is named for an earthwork structure (named for Wright) that was planned during the Confederate invasion of Kentucky in the summer of 1862 while Wright was in command of the Department of the Ohio. Designed to be a five-sided fortification, it was never completed. The earthwork was destroyed in the 1880s by road construction.Northern Kentucky Communities . Fort H. G.

It also called due to the legend that whenever an enemy approaches the castle, a thick mist appears and hides it. Built at the end of the Sengoku period, the castle was occupied by a succession of daimy≈ç of Maruoka Domain under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. The site is now a public park noted for its sakura. The castle‚Äôs relatively small tenshu (castle keep) claims to be the oldest in the country, a claim which is challenged by both Inuyama Castle and Matsumoto Castle. Background Maruoka Castle is located on top of a small hill in the plains north of the city of Fukui. The area around the foot of the hill was levelled, and protected by ramparts and a pentagonal-shaped moat. The castle is located on the Hokurikud≈ç highway connecting Kaga Province with Echizen Province, at the juncture of the Mino Kaid≈ç highway connecting inland Mino Province with the Sea of Japan. History=Construction Maruoka Castle is considered to have been constructed in 1576 by Shibata Katsutoyo, who was the nephew and adopted son of Shibata Katsuie, one of Oda Nobunaga's leading generals. According to the legend of \\"O-shizu, Hitobashira\\" the castle was constructed with a human pillar. During construction the stone base of the [tenshu kept collapsing no matter how many times it was piled up. There was one vassal who suggested that they should make someone a human sacrifice (hitobashira) to appease the gods. O-shizu, a one-eyed woman who had two children and lived a poor life, was selected as the Hitobashira. She resolved to become one on the condition that one of her children was taken in by Katsutoyo and made a samurai. Standing in position the base stones were positioned around her, until they eventually crushed her to death. Her sacrifice allowed the construction to be successfully completed. Katsutoyo was however unable to fulfil his promise to O-shizu before he moved to another province. Resentful that her son had not been made a samurai her spirit according to legend would make the moat overflow with spring rain when the season of cutting algae came in April every year. People called it, \\"the rain caused by the tears of O-shizu's sorrow\\" and erected a small tomb to soothe her spirit. There was a poem handed down, \\"The rain which falls when the season of cutting algae comes Is the rain reminiscent of the tears of the poor O-shizu's sorrow\\". Although built in the Momoyama period (1575-1600) the design is more indicative of earlier fortresses of the Warring States period (1477-1575) . As it was being sited on top of a low hill it was decided to mount the tenshu on a high stone base in order to gain additional height. However at the time successful techniques of constructing such a steep faced base were still in their infancy, especially when using rough uncut stones (known as nozurazumi) in a steeply inclined base as adopted at Maruoka. This random-style piling of stones is suggested as the source of the instability in the walls during the construction period. Tokugawa shogunate After Shibata Katsutoyo died of illness during the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583, the castle was given to the Aoyama clan. However, the Aoyama sided with the Western Army under Ishida Mitsunari during the Battle of Sekigahara and were thus dispossessed by the victorious Tokugawa Ieyasu. Ieyasu awarded Echizen Province to his son, Y≈´ki Hideyasu, who in turn created a 26,000 koku holding centered at Maruoka for his retainer, Imamura Moritsugu. In 1613, due to an O-Ie S≈çd≈ç within Fukui Domain, the Tokugawa shogunate raised Maruoka Domain to 40,000 koku and assigned it to Honda Narishige, the son of Honda Shigetsugu, one of Ieyasu's leading generals. Due to Honda Narishige's efforts at the Siege of Osaka in 1624, the kokudaka of the domain was further raised to 46,300 koku. His son and grandson completed the castle and the surrounding j≈çkamachi. However, his great-grandson, Honda Shigemasu was an alcoholic and incompetent, and was dispossessed by the shogunate in 1695. The Honda were replaced by Arima Kiyosumi, a descendant of the Kirishitan daimy≈ç Arima Harunobu. The Arima clan continued to rule Maruoka for eighth generations until the abolition of the han system in July 1871 during the Meiji restoration. Meiji restoration After the Meiji restoration, almost all Japanese castles around the country were demolished. In the case of Maruoka while many of the castle buildings were demolished and various gates, stone walls, and trees were sold off, the tenshu and castle grounds was purchased in 1901 by the town of Maruoka and became a park. The pentagonal moat surrounding the castle was gradually filled in and partly built between the late Taisho era to the early Showa era. The tenshu was registered as a national treasure on 30 January 1934. The tenshu collapsed due to the destruction of its stone base during the 1948 Fukui earthquake. In 1955 the base was rebuilt using 70% of the original pillars and about 60% of the original beams by installing a reinforced concrete frame and piling the original stones around it before re- erecting the tenshu on top. At that time, the structure of the windows on the top floor was changed from sliding doors to push-up windows. The castle was designated an Important Cultural Property in 1950. A number of the castle gates also survive in private hands, including one at the temple of K≈çzen-ji in Komatsu, Ishikawa and one at the temple of Rensh≈ç-ji in the city of Awara, Fukui. Investigations into its construction date The Maruoka Castle Research and Research Committee lead by (Junichi Yoshida from the Fukui University of Technology) was commissioned by the Board of Education of Sakai City to survey the castle. By dating the timber used in the construction of the tenshu from its rings, radiocarbon concentration, and oxygen isotope ratio, they reported after four years of investigations in March 2019 that most of the through pillars, which play a structurally important role, were cut down after 1626. In Japanese.Confusing matters it that the tenshu is of the watchtower type which by the 1620s was out of date due to a change in architectural styles. This would indicate that if it had been built in 1576 by Katsutoyo Shibata, it was then heavily reconstructed in the latter half of the 1620s (mostly likely in 1628) by the Honda clan following Honda Narishige being assigned ownership of the castle in 1613. In Japanese. In October 2019 the northeast exterior wall of the tenshu was damaged by an typhoon and were subsequently repaired by the Tanaka Shrine Co.ref> In Japanese. Current status Maruoka Castle is one of just twelve castles in Japan which has managed to keep its original tenshu. The former castle grounds are now incorporated in the Kasumigajo Park, which contain some remnants of the ramparts and moats as well as a small museum that displays some arms, armour, and household items related to its former lords. The area is famed for its approximately 400 cherry blossom trees. An annual cherry blossom festival is held during the first three weeks of April during which the trees are lit up in the evenings by over 300 paper lanterns. Description Sitting atop a 6.2-metre (20 ft 4 in) high stone platform set among Japanese black pine and cherry trees, access to the tenshu is via a long staircase leading directly into its black wooden interior. The tenshu has three floors, with uppermost serving as a watchtower. The tenshu has a number of unique design features. While the roof originally had wood shingles In Japanese. at some stage these were replaced with roof tiles made from a local stone called shakudani. These stone tiles mean the roof is unusually heavy with a weight of 60 tons which is more than double the weight of a normal tile-roofed or wooden shingle roof. In Japanese.Other sources quote a weight of 120 tons. The reason for using stone tiles believed to have been because they provided superior thermal insulation during the winter. The roof also features stone shachihako (fish/tiger) ornaments. The righthand side of the tenshu has a series of protruding ishiotoshimado (stone-dropping windows) that allowed defenders to shoot at attracters via timber slats and also via a trap door to drop stones or pour oil or boiling water on attackers underneath.

It has a distinctively loud and high-pitched sound, and is used frequently in Chinese traditional music ensembles, particularly those that perform outdoors. It is an important instrument in the folk music of northern China, particularly the provinces of Shandong and Henan, where it has long been used for festival and military purposes. It is still used, in combination with sheng mouth organs, gongs, drums, and sometimes other instruments, in wedding and funeral processions. Such wind and percussion ensembles are called chuida or guchui. Stephen Jones has written extensively on its use in ritual music of Shanxi province. It is also common in the ritual music of Southeast China. In Taiwan, it forms an essential element of ritual music that accompanies Daoist performances of both auspicious and inauspicious rites, i.e., those for both the living and the dead. Construction The suona as used in China has a conical wooden body, similar to that of the gyaling horn used by the Tibetan ethnic group, both of which uses a metal, usually a tubular brass or copper bocal to which a small double reed is affixed, and possesses a detachable metal bell at its end. The double-reed gives the instrument a sound similar to that of the modern oboe. The traditional version has seven finger holes. The instrument is made in several sizes. Since the mid-20th century, \\"modernized\\" versions of the suona have been developed in China; incorporating mechanical keys similar to those of the European oboe, to allow for the playing of chromatic notes and equal tempered tuning (both of which are difficult to execute on the traditional suona). There is now a family of such instruments, including the zhongyin suona (Alto suona), cizhongyin suona (Tenor suona), and diyin suona (Bass suona). These instruments are used in the woodwind sections of modern large Chinese traditional instrument orchestras in China, Taiwan, and Singapore, though most folk ensembles prefer to use the traditional version of the instrument. It has been used in modern music arrangements as well, including in the works of Chinese rock musician Cui Jian, featuring a modernized suona-play in his song \\"Nothing To My Name\\" (‰∏ÄÊó†ÊâÄÊúâ) (played by the saxophonist Liu Yuan). The nazi (ÂëêÂ≠ê), a related instrument that is most commonly used in northern China, consists of a suona reed (with bocal) that is played melodically, the pitches changed by the mouth and hands.video Sometimes the nazi is played into a large metal horn for additional volume. Ranges of the orchestral \\"suona\\": *Piccolo in G and F () *Sopranino suona in D and C () *Soprano suona in A and G () *Alto suona in D () *Tenor suona in G () *Bass suona in various keys () The tenor and bass varieties are normally keyed; the alto and soprano varieties are sometimes keyed. The highest varieties are not normally keyed. History=Origins Although the origin of the suona is unclear, with some texts dating the use of the suona as far back as the Jin dynasty (265-420), there is a consensus that the suona originated outside of the domains of ancient Chinese kingdoms, possibly having been developed from Central Asian instruments such as the sorna, surnay, or zurna, from which its Chinese name may have been derived. Other sources state the origins of the suona to be Arabia, or India. A musician playing an instrument very similar to a suona is shown on a drawing on a Silk Road religious monument in western Xinjiang province dated to the 3rd to 5th centuries, and depictions dating to this period found in Shandong and other regions of northern China depict it being played in military processions, sometimes on horseback. It was not mentioned in Chinese literature until the Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), but by this time the suona was already established in northern China. Other instruments related to the suona may have also descended from the Asian zurna, such as the European shawm. Other examples include the Korean taepyeongso, the Vietnamese k√®n and the Japanese charumera. The latter's name is derived from charamela, the Portuguese word for shawm. Its sound is well known throughout Japan, as it is often used by street vendors selling ramen.Charumera WorldRamen.com Use outside China The suona is used as a traditional instrument by Cubans in Oriente and Havana, having been introduced by Chinese immigrants during the colonial era. Known locally as corneta china, it is one of the lead instruments in the conga carnival music of Santiago de Cuba since 1915. In Havana, the term trompeta china is sometimes used. In America, jazz saxophonist Dewey Redman often played the suona in his performances, calling it a \\"musette\\". English bassist and saxophonist Mick Karn used the instrument crediting it as a dida.

The Polish army, commanded by J√≥zef Ch≈Çopicki, succeeded in preventing its Russian counterpart, under Hans Karl von Diebitsch, from crushing the uprising. However, the battle has also been described as an inconclusive bloodbath.  Prelude  The first months after the outbreak of the November Uprising saw no hostilities between Poland and Russia. Both the Polish commander J√≥zef Ch≈Çopicki and Russian Tsar Nicholas I were hoping for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, neither side could propose a satisfactory compromise, and on 25 January 1831 Nicholas was deposed from the Polish throne. This was seen as a de facto declaration of war and the Russian Army under Hans Karl von Diebitsch was ordered to enter Poland and crush the rebellion. The Russian army entered Poland on 4 February and started a fast advance towards Warsaw. Despite several minor battles and skirmishes, in which the Russian army suffered significant losses, the advance could not be stopped by the Polish forces, which were both numerically and technically inferior. On 24 February the Russian Army reached the outskirts of Warsaw in two columns. Initially Diebitsch was planning an all-out assault on Warsaw on 26 February. However, the successful Polish counter-attack in the Battle of Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka, in which the 13,500 men strong Corps of General Ivan Shakhovskoy was defeated and forced to retreat, made Diebitsch change his plans and attack earlier than planned.  Armies  The Polish forces deployed to the east of Warsaw constituted the majority of the Polish Army. Apart from the II Infantry Brigade under General Kazimierz Ma≈Çachowski, dispatched to the north to take part in the Battle of Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka, the forces of General J√≥zef Ch≈Çopicki included some 36000 soldiers and 115 cannon of various calibres. The majority of the Polish forces was composed of fresh, poorly trained and ill-equipped volunteers. However, the core of the Polish Army was composed of Napoleonic Wars veterans. The Russian forces had some 59000 men under arms and 178 cannon. In addition, at 15:00 the weakened corps of General Shakhovskiy arrived at the battlefield and took part in the assault. The forces of Field Marshal Diebitsch were organised into five Infantry Corps, with some cavalry units attached to them. However, the main part of the Russian cavalry was defeated in the Battle of Stoczek and did not enter the combat. Battle of Groch√≥w 1831  Battle  The Polish counter- attack in the area of Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka on 24 February surprised the Russians. In the early morning of 25 February, after both units taking part in the Battle of Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka were on the verge of breaking after a night-long city fight, the Poles threw in the reserve 1st Infantry Division under General Jan Krukowiecki. The Russians started a retreat and the Poles started a pursuit, but the Polish advance was halted after an hour. The sound of the nearby battle made Field Marshal Dybich change his plans and order an assault on Polish positions 24 hours earlier than planned. At noon the I Corps and the Corps of General Grigoriy Vladimirovich Rosen were ordered to assault the Polish 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions (Generals Skrzynecki and ≈ªymirski, respectively) in the woods east of Groch√≥w. At the same time the Corps of General Pahlen was ordered to outflank the Poles from the south and strike through the lines of the Polish 4th Infantry Division of General Szembek. Although the Russians had numerical superiority and better equipment on their side, the Polish lines were well-hidden in the woods and the Russian artillery had difficulties supporting the advancing infantry. Despite numerous assaults, both the woods and the Groch√≥w-Goc≈Çawek road were still in Polish hands at dusk. After suffering heavy casualties, the Russians withdrew from the battlefield. However, the Poles had also lost a large part of their forces and were unable to organise a successful pursuit.  Aftermath  In the course of a day-long struggle the Russians lost at least 9500 killed and wounded, and were forced to abandon their plans of capturing Warsaw and thus ending the Polish uprising with one blow. Polish losses were slightly fewer, but also significant: between 6900 and 7300 dead and wounded. However, Ch≈Çopicki did not start a pursuit after the fleeing Russians and did not take advantage of the success. Because of this, the battle is described as a marginal Polish victory in most handbooks and monographs, both modern and contemporary. Some authors argue that, although the Russian forces were badly beaten and forced to retreat and abandon their plans of capturing Warsaw, the lack of Polish pursuit resulted in the battle being either a Pyrrhic victory or simply an inconclusive bloodbath. Finally, several Russian sources claim that the result of the battle was a Russian victory  References  Sources  # # #  External links  * Map of the battle * Re-enactment of the battle: , Olszynka Grochowska Olszynka Grochowska Olszynka Grochowska Weso≈Ça 1831 in Poland February 1831 events ","title":"Battle of Olszynka Grochowska"},{"id":"1342624","text":"Ethan Allen Hitchcock (September 19, 1835 ‚Äì April 9, 1909) served under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt as U.S. Secretary of the Interior.

The Slavic root of starost translates as \\"senior\\". Since the Middle Ages, it has meant an official in a leadership position in a range of civic and social contexts throughout the Slavic world. In terms of a municipality, a starosta was historically a senior royal administrative official, equivalent to the County Sheriff or the outdated Seneschal, and analogous to a gubernator. In Poland, a starosta would administer crown territory or a delineated district called a starostwo. In the early Middle Ages, the starosta could head a settled urban or rural community or other communities, such as a church starosta, or an artel starosta, etc. The starosta also functioned as the master of ceremonies in traditional Carpatho- Rusyn, Ukrainian, and Polish weddings, similar to the stari svat (—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–∏ —Å–≤–∞—Ç) at Serbian weddings. Kingdom of Poland In the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, the Starosta was from the 15th century the office of a territorial administrator, usually conferred on a local landowner and member of the nobility, Szlachta. Until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, there were two types of Starosta: *Castle Starosta, (formerly Castellan or capitaneus cum iurisdictione), Starosta grodowy as local representative of the king, would supervise fiscal, judicial administration and matters of crime in a district, termed starostwo, and *Land-Starosta, Starosta niegrodowy, capitaneus sine iurisdictione, whose role (they were invariably male) was as overseer of crown land tenants and of the land tenure (see tenant-in-chief) without any real obligations. The absence of an Interdict against the accumulation of thus administered districts resulted in some nobles becoming immensely rich and earning the sobriquet, magnates. There were also general starosts who were provincial governors. All starosts disappeared after the Kosciuszko Insurrection in 1794 and were not reinstated until after World War I when their role was altered. In contemporary Poland, starosta designates a district administrator, who heads the district administration starostwo and manages a powiat district, akin to the leader of a town or rural council. Czech Republic and Slovakia In the Czech Republic and Slovakia starosta is the title of a mayor of a town or village. Mayors of major cities use the title prim√°tor. The term corresponds to the Austrian or German B√ºrgermeister. Holy Roman Empire Historically, the title \\"Starost\\" was also used in parts of the Holy Roman Empire but was not tied to ownership of land. The German word Starostei referred to the office or crown land district of a Starost. In German, the title starost/starosta is also translated as Hauptmann and analogous to a gubernator. Other countries *In Ruthenia (Kievan Rus) it was a lower government official. *In Lithuania since 1991, seni≈´nas is the title of the head of a province. *In Galicia and Bukovina under Austrian rule a starosta supervised the county administration. *In Russia the word was used until the early 20th century to denote the elected leader of obshchina. *In Ukraine during 1918 it was a post of an appointed official who represented the central government in regions.

It is commonly used in Northern Chinese cuisine, Northeastern Chinese cuisine, as well as Korean-Chinese cuisine. Peking duck and jajangmyeon are two popular dishes that feature the sauce.  Etymology  The Chinese word ti√°nmi√†nji√†ng () consists of characters meaning \\"sweet\\" (), \\"flour\\" (), and \\"sauce\\" (). It is also called ti√°nji√†ng (), which means \\"sweet sauce\\". The origin of the Korean word chunjang () is unknown. One theory is that it derived from the word cheomjang (), which is the Korean reading of the Chinese characters .  Preparation  Although terms such as \\"sweet bean sauce\\" and \\"sweet bean paste\\" are used to describe the sauce, it is primarily made from fermented wheat flour. A mixture of approximately 19 portions of wheat flour to one portion of soybean is used. The fermentation starter is made from dried or stale mantou (a steamed bread), wrapped in a variety of muskmelon known as miangua and then bound and hung in a cool, dark place until completely dried. During the fermentation process, the glucose and maltose give the paste its distinctive sweet taste.  Variations and uses = Chinese varieties  Similar to hoisin sauce, sweet bean sauce may be used in dishes such as Peking Duck. It is also used as a sweeter substitute for saltier yellow soybean paste. In Northern China, the sauce is also eaten with raw scallions. There are many different types of sweet bean sauces. Recipes and methods of production vary depending on the geographical region and on manufacturer preferences. In northern China, more sugar is added to the sauce. In southern China, mantou flour instead of sugar is commonly used as the main ingredient. Traditionally, high-quality sweet bean sauces owe their sweet flavor to the fermentation of starches rather than to the addition of refined sugar. Sweet bean sauce can be found in standard Asian supermarkets under various English names. In Chinese, it is written ÁîúÈù¢ÈÖ±.  Korean chunjang  Chunjang In Korea, chunjang () is most commonly used to make jajang (), a black gravy served with a popular noodle dish called jajangmyeon. Other common dishes with jajang sauce include jajang-bap (\\"rice with jajang sauce\\") and jajang-tteok-bokki (stir-fried rice cakes with jajang sauce). Although stir- frying chunjang to make jajang is the most common use for the sauce, chunjang may also be served as an accompaniment to sliced raw onions. In most Korean- Chinese restaurants, raw onions, chunjang, and danmuji (yellow pickled radish) are the basic side dishes. Korean chunjang is similar to the Shandong-style ti√°nmi√†nji√†ng, as it was first used in Incheon Chinatown, where the majority of restaurants were run by Chinese immigrants from Shandong. However, now most Korean-Chinese restaurants are run by Koreans, and chunjang has adapted to Korean tastes, as have other Korean-Chinese dishes and ingredients.

Allodial title is related to the concept of land held \\"in allodium\\", or land ownership by occupancy and defense of the land. Historically, much of land was uninhabited and could, therefore, be held \\"in allodium\\".What is Allodial Title?. REMAXWest. Most property ownership in common law jurisdictions is fee simple. In the United States, the land is subject to eminent domain by federal, state and local government, and subject to the imposition of taxes by state and/or local governments, and there is thus no true allodial land. Some states within the U.S. (notably, Nevada and Texas) have provisions for considering land allodial under state law, and the term may be used in other circumstances.For example, the Constitution of the State of Minnesota states that \\"All lands within the state are allodial and feudal tenures of every description with all their incidents are prohibited.\\" Constitution of the State of Minnesota. Land is \\"held of the Crown\\" in England and Wales and other jurisdictions in the Commonwealth realms. Some land in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, known as udal land, is held in a manner akin to allodial land in that these titles are not subject to the ultimate ownership of the Crown. In France, while allodial title existed before the French Revolution, it was rare and limited to ecclesiastical properties and property that had fallen out of feudal ownership. After the French Revolution allodial title became the norm in France and other civil law countries that were under Napoleonic legal influences. In October 1854, the seigneurial system of Lower Canada, which had been ceded from France to Britain in 1763 at the conclusion of the Seven Years' War, was extinguished by the Seigneurial Tenures Abolition Act of October 1854, and a form similar to socage replaced it. Property owned under allodial title is referred to as allodial land, allodium, or an allod. In the Domesday Book it is called alod. Historically, allodial title was sometimes used to distinguish ownership of land without feudal duties from ownership by feudal tenure which restricted alienation and burdened land with the tenurial rights of a landholder's overlord or sovereign. Legal concept Allodial lands are the absolute property of their owner and not subject to any rent, service, or acknowledgment to a superior. Allodial title is therefore an alternative to feudal land tenure. However, historian J. C. Holt states that \\"In Normandy the word alodium, whatever its sense in other parts of the Continent, meant not land held free of seigneurial services, but land held by hereditary right\\", and that \\"alodium and feodum should be given the same meaning in England\\". Allodium, meaning \\"land exempt from feudal duties\\", is first attested in English-language texts in the 11th-century Domesday Book, but was borrowed from Old Low Franconian *all≈çd, meaning \\"full property\\", and attested in Latin as e.g., , , in the Salic law (c. A.D. 507‚Äì596) and other Germanic laws. The word is a compound of *all \\"whole, full\\" and *≈çd \\"estate, property\\" (cf. Old Saxon ≈çd, Old English ead, Old Norse au√∞r).C.T. Onions, ed., Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, s.v. \\"allodium\\" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), 26‚Äì27. Allodial tenure seems to have been common throughout northern Europe, but is now unknown in common law jurisdictions apart from the United States, Scotland and the Isle of Man. An allod could be converted into a fief, by the owner surrendering it to a lord and receiving it back as a fief. Allodial land title is common in the Isle of Man which has laws with Nordic origins. A version called udal tenure exists in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, also of Nordic origin. These are the only parts of the United Kingdom where allodial title exists, with the few exceptions. One such exception is the Scottish Barony of the Bachuil, which is not of feudal origin like other baronies but is allodial in that it predates (A.D. 562) Scotland itself and the feudal system, dating from the Gaelic Kingdom of D√°l Riata. In recognition as allodial Barons par le Gr√¢ce de Dieu not barons by a feudal crown grant, the Baron of the Bachuil has the only coat of arms in Scotland granted a cap of maintenance with a \\"vair\\" (squirrel fur) lining (as opposed to ermine) by the Lord Lyon Court. Another exception is Somerset House which was vested in His Majesty explicitly not in fee simple, and is held to be allodial. Development of equitable title As late as the Tudor period, in order to avoid estate taxes, a legal loophole was exploited where land was willed to a trustee for the use of the beneficiary. However, trustees often abused this privilege, and heirs found that the courts of common law would refuse to recognize the \\"use\\" clause, and would instead grant title in law to the trustee. However, the courts of equity, which were developed by the sovereign to deal with obvious injustices in the common law courts, ruled that the heirs were entitled to the use of the property, and gave them title in equity. As rulings of equity courts ranked above those of common law courts, this gave heirs the use of the land, but not title to it in the common law. However, this distinction between common law and equity title helped develop forms of security based on the distinction, now known as the mortgage. Enjoyment of the property during the period where the mortgage was in good standing could be assured through the equity courts, while the right to foreclose on the property to merge the common law and equity title were guaranteed in the common law courts. Proof of ownership Until the 18th century, almost all common law property ownership depended on proving a link of possession from a royal grant of title to the property owner. Although the feudal system had ceased from England in 1660, and is now fee simple taxation, in theory the feudal chain of title still exists, although it is a formality. However, proving ownership in the absence of the documents was an impossibility, and forgeries of crown grants were common and difficult to detect. Moreover, it was nearly impossible to determine if land was subject to common law encumbrances (i.e. mortgages). This led to the establishment in the 18th century of land registry systems, where a central office in each county was responsible for the filing of land deeds, mortgages, liens and other evidence of ownership, transfer or encumbrance. Under land registry, deeds and charges were not recognized unless they were filed, and persons who filed were given priority over previous transactions that had not been filed. Moreover, under statutes of limitation, in certain jurisdictions only documents that had been filed in the past 40 years had to be consulted to determine the chain of ownership. United States Before 1774, all land in the American colonies could also be traced to royal grants, either a single enormous grant creating each proprietary colony (e.g. Pennsylvania and Maryland), or smaller direct grants within crown colonies (e.g. Virginia). The original grantee (recipient of the land) then sold or granted parcels of land within his grant to private citizens and other legal entities. The Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended formal hostilities and recognized American independence, also had the effect of ending any residual rights held by the original grantees or the Crown. This recognized that no person holding land in the new United States owed any allegiance or duty to the Crown. Apart from land that was formally owned at the time of the Revolutionary War, most American landholders can trace their title back to grants by the federal or state governments of land obtained by purchase (Louisiana Purchase, Florida, Alaska), treaty (the Ohio Valley, New Mexico, Arizona, and California), or annexation (Texas, Hawaii). However, in reality, previous grants prior to those territories becoming US possessions were recognized; ownership under French and Spanish crown grants in the Louisiana Purchase and Guadalupe-Hidalgo/Gadsden territories remained valid. Although in Dartmouth College v. Woodward the United States Supreme Court rebuffed New Hampshire's attempt to convert Dartmouth College from a private college into a public university, the Court decided this was based on the Constitution prohibiting states from impairing the obligations of the contract which created the private corporation that owned the land, and not based on any principle that the land was somehow immune from state control. Many state constitutions (Arkansas, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York) refer to allodial title, but only to clearly distinguish it from feudal title. The conditions under which the government can compel the sale of privately owned real property for public necessity are established by eminent domain laws of either the federal or state governments, respectively. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires just compensation for eminent domain compelled sale. In addition, the government powers of police power and escheat have been retained in the American legal system. Limited allodial title Other institutional property ownership can also be called allodial, in that property granted for certain uses is held absolutely and cannot be alienated in most circumstances. For example, universities and colleges that hold property for educational purposes can be described as having allodial title. In most states, property held by churches for the purpose of worship also has status similar to allodial title. Native American reservations also share some similarity with allodial title. However, in all these cases, it is also clear that if the title ceases to be used for the purposes for which it was granted, it reverts to the state or the federal government. =Nevada= In 1997, the Nevada Legislature created a new section of statutes within the property tax statutory scheme. Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 361.900 to 361.920. These statutes, which are entitled \\"Allodial Title\\", became effective on 1 July 1998, and were intended to protect property owners from the burden of the high increases in property taxes that often occur when unincorporated land becomes part of a town or city. Nevada allowed persons who owned and lived in single family residences to obtain allodial title if the property was not mortgaged and had no tax liens. Allodial titles were subject to exemptions from seizure in debt or bankruptcy under homestead laws; however, a property could be seized if used in a criminal enterprise. In 2005, the Nevada Legislature prohibited applications by property owner for an allodial title after June 13 of that year. The classes of persons who can apply for allodial title and of property for which those persons may obtain allodial title are limited: A person who owns and occupies a single-family dwelling, its appurtenances and the land on which it is located, free and clear of all encumbrances, except any unpaid assessment for a public improvement, may apply to the county assessor to establish allodial title to the dwellings, appurtenances and the land on which it is located. One or more persons who own such a home in any form of joint ownership may apply for the allodial title, jointly if the dwelling is occupied by each person included in the application. After the county assessor receives the application, he transfers it to the state treasurer. The state treasurer then determines the amount which is required to be paid by the property owner to establish allodial title. This is done by using \\"a tax rate of $5 for each $100 of assessed valuation on the date of the application\\". The treasurer must calculate, separately, the amount that must be paid in a lump sum, and for the payment in instalments over a period of not more than 10 years. These \\"amounts must be calculated to the best ability of the state treasurer so that the money paid plus the interest or other income earned on that money will be adequate to pay all future tax liability of the property for a period equal to the life expectancy of the youngest titleholder of the property\\". If the property owner pays the lump sum amount calculated by the state treasurer, and submits proof that the home is a single-family dwelling occupied by the homeowner, and that the property is free and clear of all encumbrances except any unpaid assessment for a public improvement, \\"the state treasurer shall issue a certificate of allodial title\\". If the property owner enters into an agreement with the state to make instalment payments (in lieu of a lump sum payment), the issue of a certificate of allodial title occurs upon the receipt by the treasurer of the last payment. Once a property owner receives a certificate of allodial title, he is relieved from the payment of all further property taxes, \\"unless the allodial title is relinquished by the homeowner or his heirs\\". Instead, the state treasurer is responsible for the payment of the taxes due. Once allodial title is established, it \\"is valid for as long as the homeowner continues to own the residence unless he chooses to relinquish the allodial title\\".NRS 361.910 (1) Upon the death of an allodial title holder, the heir or heirs can reestablish allodial title by using the same procedure that the original property owner used. The holder of an allodial title can voluntarily relinquish it at any time.NR8 361.915 (1) The title shall be relinquished if the property is sold, leased or transferred by the allodial title holder; the allodial title holder no longer occupies the dwelling for 150 days; or the home is converted to anything other than a single-family dwelling occupied by the owner. If allodial title is relinquished, either voluntarily or otherwise, the property owner receives a refund of the unused portion of the payments made to originally establish the allodial title.NRS 361.915 (3)‚Äì(4) Once the allodial title is relinquished, the property owner is once again responsible for all future property taxes. The importance and benefit of establishing allodial title extends beyond the non-payment of property taxes. It also has significance in the area of homestead law. Pursuant to NRS 115.010, the available homestead exemption in Nevada is $605,000. However, if allodial title has been established and not relinquished, the homestead exemption \\"extends to all equity in the dwelling, its appurtenances and the land on which it is located\\". Furthermore, although the regular homestead exemption provides no protection against legal process to enforce the payment of obligations contracted for the purchase of the property, or for improvements made thereon (including any mechanic's lien lawfully obtained), or for legal taxes, or for any mortgage or deed of trust executed upon the property, the holder of an allodial title is fully exempt from all of these under the homestead laws. The only area within the homestead laws wherein allodial title fails to provide an extra benefit is in the realm of civil and criminal forfeiture of property. Similar to all property in Nevada, property held by allodial title is subject to forfeiture for criminal conduct.

Hemingway's second work of nonfiction, Green Hills of Africa is an account of a month on safari he and his wife, Pauline Marie Pfeiffer, took in East Africa during December 1933. Green Hills of Africa is divided into four parts: \\"Pursuit and Conversation\\", \\"Pursuit Remembered\\", \\"Pursuit and Failure\\", and \\"Pursuit as Happiness\\", each of which plays a different role in the story. Synopsis Much of the narrative describes Hemingway's adventures hunting in East Africa, interspersed with ruminations about literature and authors. Generally the East African landscape Hemingway describes is in the region of Lake Manyara in Tanzania. The book starts with Part 1 (\\"Pursuit and Conversation\\"), with Hemingway and a European expat in conversation about American writers. Relations between the white hunters and native trackers are described, as well as Hemingway's jealousy of the other hunters. Part 2 (\\"Pursuit Remembered\\") presents a flashback of hunting in northern Tanzania with a description of the Rift Valley and descriptions of how to field dress prey. Hemingway kills a rhino, but his friend Karl kills a bigger one. The literary discussion moves to European writers such as Tolstoy, Flaubert, Stendhal, and Dostoevsky. In Part 3 (\\"Pursuit and Failure\\") the action returns to the present with Hemingway unlucky in hunting, unable to find a kudu he tracks. He moves to an untouched piece of country with the native trackers. In Part 4 (\\"Pursuit and Happiness\\") Hemingway and some of his trackers arrive at seemingly virgin country. There he kills a kudu bull with huge horns (52 inches). Back in the camp, he discovers that Karl killed a kudu with bigger horns. He complains that Karl is a terrible hunter with infinite luck. On the last day he learns that many of the guides consider him a brother. Background and publication history Green Hills of Africa (1935) initially appeared in serialization in Scribner's Magazine, and was published in 1935. An autobiographical account of his 1933 trip to Africa, Hemingway presents the subject of big game hunting in a non-fiction form in Green Hills of Africa. The serialization occurred from May to November 1935. The book was published on 25 October 1935 to a first edition print-run of 10,500 copies.Oliver, p. 131 Reception Ernest Hemingway poses with skulls of kudu and female of sable antelope. East Africa, February 1934. JFK Library Green Hills of Africa initially got a cool reception. Writing for The New York Times, critic John Chamberlain claimed: \\"Green Hills of Africa is not one of the major Hemingway works. Mr. Hemingway has so simplified his method that all his characters talk the lingo perfected in The Sun Also Rises, whether these characters are British, Austrian, Arabian, Ethiopian or Kikuyu.\\"Chamberlain, John. Books of the Times. October 25, 1935. The New York Times. Retrieved 2010-01-19 However, two days later, writing for the same newspaper, critic C. G. Poore hailed The Green Hills of Africa as \\"the best-written story of big-game hunting anywhere I have read. And more than that. It's a book about people in unacknowledged conflict and about the pleasures of travel and the pleasures of drinking and war and peace and writing.\\"Poore, C.G. Book of the Times. October 27, 1935. Retrieved 2010-01-19 Despite the better review, Hemingway said the book critics \\"killed\\" the book.Donaldson, The Cambridge Companion to Hemingway, p.184 He went into a deep depression, and said he was \\"ready to blow my lousy head off\\". Within a few months he was ready to blame the corrupting influence of the wealthy women in his life‚Äîhis wife Pauline and his mistress Jane Mason. The result of his bitterness were two stories about Africa: \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\" and \\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\\", that featured husbands married to domineering women. Literary analysis The foreword of Green Hills of Africa immediately identifies this as a work of nonfiction that should be compared with similar works of fiction: > Unlike many novels, none of the characters or incidents in this book is > imaginary. Any one not finding sufficient love interest is at liberty, while > reading it, to insert whatever love interest he or she may have at the time. > The writer has attempted to write an absolutely true book to see whether the > shape of a country and the pattern of a month's action can, if truly > presented, compete with a work of the imagination.[Hemingway, Ernest. Green > Hills of Africa. 1935. Rpt. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1996. ] The book is well known today for a line that has nearly nothing to do with its subject. This quote is frequently used as evidence that Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is The Great American Novel:[The Hemingway Review, Vol. 22, No. 2, Spring 2003. The Ernest Hemingway Foundation. Published by the University of Idaho Press, Moscow, Idaho. (Jungman, Robert & Tabor, Carole. Henry James on Safari in Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa. Louisiana Tech University.)] > The good writers are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and Mark Twain. That's not > the order they're good in. There is no order for good writers.... All modern > American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry > Finn. If you read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the > boys. That is the real end. The rest is just cheating. But it's the best > book we've had. All American writing comes from that. There was nothing > before. There has been nothing as good since. One episode in Green Hills of Africa is Hemingway's conversation with the Austrian farmer Kandisky, whom Hemingway stops to help when Kandisky's truck breaks down. After initially trading opinions on German writers like Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann and disagreeing on their views of hunting, Hemingway and the Austrian later discuss American literature over dinner, and it turns out that one of the few American writers Hemingway approves of is Henry James, whom he mentions twice. Specifically, Hemingway says: \\"The good American writers are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and Mark Twain‚Äù and adds later that ‚ÄúHenry James wanted to make money. He never did, of course‚Äù. Intermixed with these comments on James, Crane, and Twain are Hemingway‚Äôs views of American writers in general, most of whom, he says, came to a bad end. When Kandisky asks about himself Hemingway tells him, \\"I am interested in other things. I have a good life but I must write because if I do not write a certain amount I do not enjoy the rest of my life.‚Äù When asked what he wants, Hemingway replies, ‚ÄúTo write as well as I can and learn as I go along. At the same time, I have my life which I enjoy and which is a damned good life.\\"  References = Further reading   External links * 1935 non-fiction books Books by Ernest Hemingway Books about Africa American travel books Charles Scribner's Sons books ","title":"Green Hills of Africa"},{"id":"1342671","text":"Wojski HreczechaWojski Hreczecha from Pan Tadeusz) A wojski (Medieval Latin: tribunus, hence sometimes rendered into English as tribune) was an officer in medieval Poland, responsible for the security of voivodeships or districts at times when voivods and castellans had accompanied the szlachta (nobility) to war.

Major slave trading regions of Africa, 15th‚Äì19th centuries The Slave Coast is a historical name formerly used for that part of coastal West Africa along the Bight of Benin that is located between the Volta River and the Lagos Lagoon.Robin Law, \\"Slave-Raiders and Middlemen, Monopolists and Free-Traders: The Supply of Slaves for the Atlantic Trade in Dahomey c. 1715-1850\\", The Journal of African History, Vol. 30, No. 1 (1989), p. 46 The name is derived from the region's history as a major source of Africans that were taken into slavery during the Atlantic slave trade from the early 16th century to the late 19th century. Other nearby coastal regions historically known by their prime colonial export are the Gold Coast, the Ivory Coast (or Windward Coast), and the Pepper Coast (or Grain Coast). History European sources began documenting the development of trade in this region and its integration into the trans- Atlantic slave trade around 1670. The slave trade became so extensive in the 18th and 19th centuries that an \\"Atlantic community\\" was formed.Law, Robin. The Slave Coast of West Africa 1550‚Äì1750: The Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade on an African Society. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1991. p. 307. The slave trade was facilitated on the European end by the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French and the British Slaves went to the New World, mostly to Brazil and the Caribbean. Ports that exported these slaves from Africa include Ouidah, Lagos, An√©ho (Little Popo), Grand-Popo, Agou√©, Jakin, Porto-Novo, and Badagry. These ports traded in slaves that were supplied from African communities, tribes and kingdoms, including the Alladah and Ouidah, which were later taken over by the Dahomey kingdom. Researchers estimate that between two and three million people were stolen out of this region and traded for goods like alcohol and tobacco from the Americas and textiles from Europe. Current estimates are that about 12 million Africans were shipped across the Atlantic from West Africa, although the number purchased by traders was considerably higher.Ronald Segal, The Black Diaspora: Five Centuries of the Black Experience Outside Africa (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995), , p. 4. \\"It is now estimated that 11,863,000 slaves were shipped across the Atlantic.\\" (Note in original: Paul E. Lovejoy, \\"The Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade on Africa: A Review of the Literature\\", in Journal of African History 30 (1989), p. 368.)Eltis, David and Richardson, David, \\"The Numbers Game\\". In: Northrup, David: The Atlantic Slave Trade, 2nd ed., Houghton Mifflin Co., 2002, p. 95.Basil Davidson. The African Slave Trade. The coast was called \\"the White man's grave\\" due to the mass amount of death from illnesses such as yellow fever, malaria, heat exhaustion, and many gastro-entero sicknesses. In 1841, 80% of British sailors on expeditions up the Niger River were infected with fevers. Between 1844 and 1854, 20 of the 74 French missionaries in Senegal died from local illnesses and 19 more died shortly after arriving back to France. Intermarriage has been documented in ports like Ouidah where Europeans were permanently stationed. Communication was quite extensive between all three areas of trade, to the point where even individual slaves could be tracked.Law, Robin. The Slave Coast of West Africa 1550‚Äì1750: The Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade on an African Society. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1991. p. 319. This complex exchange fostered political and cultural as well as commercial connections between these three regions. Religions, architectural styles, languages, knowledge, and other new goods were mingled at this time. In addition to the slaves, free men used the exchange routes to travel to new places, and both slaves and free travellers aided in blending European and African cultures. After slavery was abolished by European countries, the slave trade continued for a time with independent traders instead of government agents. Cultural integration had become so extensive that the defining characteristics of each culture were increasingly broadened. In the case of Brazilian culture--which had differentiated itself from Portuguese culture through its combination of African, Portuguese and New World traditions‚ÄîBrazilian-style dress, cuisine and speaking Portuguese had become the main requirements for Brazilian identity, regardless of ethnicity, religion, or geographic location.Law, Robin.

Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. Large amounts may result in fluid overload, swelling, acidosis, and high blood sodium. In those with long- standing low blood sodium, excessive use may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome. Saline is in the crystalloid family of medications. It is most commonly used as a sterile 9 g of salt per litre (0.9%) solution, known as normal saline. Higher and lower concentrations may also occasionally be used. Saline has a pH of 5.5 (mainly due to dissolved carbon dioxide) making it acidic. The medical use of saline began around 1831. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, sodium was the 225th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Concentrations Saline solution for irrigation. Concentrations vary from low to normal to high. High concentrations are used rarely in medicine but frequently in molecular biology. Normal Normal saline (NSS, NS or N/S) is the commonly used phrase for a solution of 0.90% w/v of NaCl, 308 mOsm/L or 9.0 g per liter. Less commonly, this solution is referred to as physiological saline or isotonic saline (because it closely approximates isotonic, that is, physiologically normal, solution); although neither of those names is technically accurate (because normal saline is not exactly like blood serum), they convey the practical effect usually seen: good fluid balance with minimal hypotonicity or hypertonicity. NS is used frequently in intravenous drips (IVs) for people who cannot take fluids orally and have developed or are in danger of developing dehydration or hypovolemia. NS is also used for aseptic purpose. NS is typically the first fluid used when hypovolemia is severe enough to threaten the adequacy of blood circulation, and has long been believed to be the safest fluid to give quickly in large volumes. However, it is now known that rapid infusion of NS can cause metabolic acidosis. The solution is 9 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolved in water, to a total volume of 1000 ml (weight per unit volume(w/v)). The mass of 1 millilitre of normal saline is 1.0046 gram at 22 ¬∞C.Fluid Density Calculator . Earthwardconsulting.com. Retrieved on 2011-02-27.Water Density Calculator . Csgnetwork.com. Retrieved on 2011-02-27. The molecular weight of sodium chloride is approximately 58.5 grams per mole, so 58.5 grams of sodium chloride equals 1 mole. Since normal saline contains 9 grams of NaCl, the concentration is 9 grams per litre divided by 58.5 grams per mole, or 0.154 mole per litre. Since NaCl dissociates into two ions ‚Äì sodium and chloride ‚Äì 1 molar NaCl is 2 osmolar. Thus, NS contains 154 mEq/L of Na+ and the same amount of Cl‚àí. This points to an osmolarity of 154 + 154 = 308, which is higher (i.e. more solute per litre) than that of blood (approximately 285). However, if the osmotic coefficient (a correction for non-ideal solutions) is taken into account, then the saline solution is much closer to isotonic. The osmotic coefficient of NaCl is about 0.93, which yields an osmolarity of 0.154 √ó 1000 √ó 2 √ó 0.93 = 286.44. Therefore, the osmolarity of normal saline is a close approximation to the osmolarity of blood. Usage For medical purposes, saline is often used to flush wounds and skin abrasions. Normal saline will not burn or sting when applied. Saline is also used in I.V. therapy, intravenously supplying extra water to rehydrate people or supplying the daily water and salt needs (\\"maintenance\\" needs) of a person who is unable to take them by mouth. Because infusing a solution of low osmolality can cause problems such as hemolysis, intravenous solutions with reduced saline concentrations (less than 0.9%) typically have dextrose (glucose) added to maintain a safe osmolality while providing less sodium chloride. The amount of normal saline infused depends largely on the needs of the person (e.g. ongoing diarrhea or heart failure). Saline is also often used for nasal washes to relieve some of the symptoms of the common cold. The solution exerts a softening and loosening influence on the mucus to make it easier to wash out and clear the nasal passages for both babiesBlocked Nose in Babies ('Snuffles') at Patient UK and adults. In very rare instances, fatal infection by the amoeba Naegleria fowleri can occur if it enters the body through the nose; therefore tap water must not be used for nasal irrigation. Water is only appropriate for this purpose if it is sterile, distilled, boiled, filtered, or disinfected. =Eyes= Eye drops are saline-containing drops used on the eye. Depending on the condition being treated, they may contain steroids, antihistamines, sympathomimetics, beta receptor blockers, parasympathomimetics, parasympatholytics, prostaglandins, non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics or topical anesthetics. Eye drops sometimes do not have medications in them and are only lubricating and tear- replacing solutions. Syringe designed saline drops (e.g. Wallace Cameron Ultra Saline Minipod) are distributed in modern needle-exchange programmes as drugs efficiently can be administered either by injection, or ophthalmic, which is compared to intravenous use; By demonstration, the elimination of latanoprost acid from plasma is rapid (half-life 17 minutes) after either ophthalmic or intravenous administration. However, ophthalmic use is done with sterile filtered drugs that is potent in quite small doses, and with adjusted acidity of pH 7.0‚Äì7.5 after the drug has been added, to avoid eye damage. The human eye has a pH of approximately 7.5, water has 7.0. =Nose= There is tentative evidence that saline nasal irrigation may help with long term cases of rhinosinusitis. Evidence for use in cases of rhinosinusitis of short duration is unclear. Hypertonic saline Vial of 23.4% sodium chloride Hypertonic saline‚Äî7% NaCl solutions are considered mucoactive agents and thus are used to hydrate thick secretions (mucus) in order to make it easier to cough up and out (expectorate). 3% hypertonic saline solutions are also used in critical care settings, acutely increased intracranial pressure, or severe hyponatremia. Inhalation of hypertonic saline has also been shown to help in other respiratory problems, specifically bronchiolitis. Hypertonic saline is currently recommended by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as a primary part of a cystic fibrosis treatment regimen. An 11% solution of xylitol with 0.65% saline stimulates the washing of the nasopharynx and has an effect on the nasal pathogenic bacteria. This has been used in complementary and alternative medicine.  Other  Other concentrations commonly used include: * Half- normal saline (0.45% NaCl), often with \\"D5\\" (5% dextrose), contains 77 mEq/L of Na and Cl and 50 g/L dextrose. * Quarter-normal saline (0.22% NaCl) has 39 mEq/L of Na and Cl and almost always contains 5% dextrose for osmolality reasons. It can be used alone in Neonatal Intensive Care Units. * Hypertonic saline may be used in perioperative fluid management protocols to reduce excessive intravenous fluid infusions and lessen pulmonary complications.Vivian McAlister, Karen E. A. Burns, Tammy Znajda, and Brian Church. \\"Hypertonic Saline for Peri-operative Fluid Management\\" Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.1 (2010): CD005576 Available at: Hypertonic saline is used in treating hyponatremia and cerebral edema Rapid correction of hyponatremia via hypertonic saline, or via any saline infusion > 40 mmol/L (Na+ having a valence of 1, 40 mmol/L = 40 mEq/L) greatly increases risk of central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), and so requires constant monitoring of the person's response. Water privation combined with diuretic block does not produce as much risk of CPM as saline administration does; however, it does not correct hyponatremia as rapidly as administration of hypertonic saline does. Due to hypertonicity, administration may result in phlebitis and tissue necrosis. As such, concentrations greater than 3% NaCl should normally be administered via a central venous catheter, also known as a 'central line'. Such hypertonic saline is normally available in two strengths, the former of which is more commonly administered: ** 3% NaCl has 513 mEq/L of Na and Cl. ** 5% NaCl has 856 mEq/L of Na and Cl. * NaCl solutions that are less commonly used are 7% (1200 mEq/L) and 23.4% (approx 4000 mEq/L), both of which are used (also via central line), often in conjunction with supplementary diuretics, in the treatment of traumatic brain injury.Access .

William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, a recent graduate of Edinburgh Medical School, proposed in an article to medical journal The Lancet to inject people with cholera with highly oxygenated salts to treat the \\"universal stagnation of the venous system and rapid cessation of arterialisation of the blood\\" seen in people with severely dehydrated cholera. He found his treatment harmless in dogs, and his proposal was soon adopted by the physician Thomas Latta in treating people with cholera to beneficial effect. In the following decades, variations and alternatives to Latta's solution were tested and used in treating people with cholera. These solutions contained a range of concentrations of sodium, chloride, potassium, carbonate, phosphate, and hydroxide. The breakthrough in achieving physiological concentrations was accomplished by Sydney Ringer in the early 1880s,Kenneth M Sutin; Marino, Paul L. (2007). \\"The ICU book\\" . Hagerstwon, MD: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. . when he determined the optimal salt concentrations to maintain the contractility of frog heart muscle tissue. Normal saline is considered a descendant of the pre-Ringer solutions, as Ringer's findings were not adopted and widely used until decades later. The term \\"normal saline\\" itself appears to have little historical basis, except for studies done in 1882‚Äì83 by Dutch physiologist Hartog Jacob Hamburger; these in vitro studies of red cell lysis suggested incorrectly that 0.9% was the concentration of salt in human blood (rather than 0.6%, the true concentration). Normal saline has become widely used in modern medicine, but due to the mismatch with real blood, other solutions have proved better. The 2018 publication of a randomized, controlled trial with 15,000 people showed that lactated Ringer's solution reduced mortality risk of people in intensive care unit by 1% compared to normal saline, which given the large number of people is a significant reduction. Society and culture Coconut water has been used in place of normal saline in areas without access to normal saline. Its use, however, has not been well studied.

This colorful Acey- Deucey board was printed on canvas and incorporates a seahorse, mermaid, compass rose, U.S. Navy Officer Rank Insignias and U.S. Navy Enlisted Rating Badges. Acey-deucey is a variant of backgammon. Since World War I, it has been a favorite game of the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Merchant Marine. Some evidence shows that it was played in the early 1900s aboard U.S. Navy ships. The game is believed to be rooted in the Middle East, Greece, or Turkey, where there were variants in which the game started with pieces off the board. Compared to standard backgammon, acey-deucey is more like a race than a strategy game. It features a differing starting position, opening play, and rules for the endgame. Because pieces may be retained in one's opponent's home board, the game offers substantial opportunities for backgame play. Other meaning Acey-deucey is deliberately riding a horse with one stirrup shorter than the other. It is most often seen in racing in the United States, where a jockey will slightly lengthen the inside stirrup to gain better balance on turns, all of which are left-handed in America. Some riders believe this helps them.http://horsehints.org/RacingTerms.htm Initial setup The opening position in acey-deucey is with no pieces on the board. The components of acey-deucey match those of backgammon, including identical boards, number of pieces, and dice. Unlike standard backgammon, all of both players' pieces are off the board when the game begins. Acey-deucey does not use the doubling cube. Opening play The initial play is markedly different from that of standard backgammon. Pieces are entered onto the opponent's inner board as if they were on the bar. Once a piece has been entered, it can be moved even though other pieces have not been entered. One strategy in the game is to keep one man, called an \\"Oscar\\", off the board until it is needed for defensive purposes. Play Play passes back and forth, with each player rolling both dice. A player who rolls doubles may move a total of four times, each move traversing as many spaces as the rolled amount (two fives rolled result in four moves of five points each). After rolling these doubles, the player takes another turn. If a player rolls an acey-deucey (= a 1 and a 2), he plays the 1-and-2; then they choose any number from 1 to 6 and act as if they had just thrown a double of it; then that player takes another turn. After the opening, gameplay is nearly identical to that of backgammon, with some notable differences: #After rolling and playing doubles or acey-deucey, the player must roll and move again. #A roll of acey-deucey counts as a 1-2, and as doubles of the player's choice. #Upon reaching one's own home board, a piece may not be moved again until all others have arrived. #An exact roll is required to bear off. #A player can move pieces even if he has pieces on the bar. Terminology USS Arkansas (BB-33). The terminology of acey-deucey is somewhat different from that of backgammon. The initial rolling of one die is called the peewee or piddle. The bar is the fence, and a single man is kicked rather than hit. The opponent's inner table is called the entering table or starting quarter, and one's own inner table is the finishing quarter. Variants Variants of the above rules exist that make the game more restrictive. #Upon rolling acey-deucey, the player does not choose the doubles for their next move. Instead, they roll one die and use that number for the doubles choice. #If a player rolls acey-deucey but is unable to utilize both the 1 and 2 (most likely because he is blocked), their turn ends. They do not get any doubles, and they do not get another roll. #If a player rolls doubles but is unable to utilize all 4 moves (most likely because they are blocked), their turn ends. They do not get another roll. This rule also holds for doubles following an acey-deucey. #Pieces may be freely moved inside one's home (bear-off) area until all other pieces have arrived. This is the opposite from the description above. #Once all pieces have arrived to the player's home area, they may not move any more. #Unlike regular backgammon, players may only bear off pieces that exactly match the dice roll. For instance, if the 6 and 5 points are open and the player rolls a 6-5, they may not use that roll to bear off a checker from the 4-point. #Pieces may be only moved from the bar upon rolling doubles. #The ability to take extra rolls for doubles and acey-deucey during bearing off have the same rules stated above. If a player rolls an acey-deucey but cannot bear off a checker from both the 1-point and the 2-point, they are not entitled to a roll for doubles or another turn. #If a player rolls a 6-6 and only has three checkers on their 6-point to bear off, they may not take another turn (although they can bear off the three checkers from that point). #At the beginning of the game, no checker may be put into play unless a double is rolled. In other words, a player may not enter a checker without first rolling a double. After the initial double, any checker may be entered as per the player's preference.

Mei lived during the Early Cretaceous period. The binomial name of its only species, Mei long (Chinese ÂØê m√®i and Èæç l√≥ng), means sleeping dragon. Description Life restoration of the juvenile type specimen Size of the holotype, compared to a human. Mei is a troodontid, a group of small, bird-like, gracile maniraptorans. All troodontids have many unique features of the skull, such as closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw, and large numbers of teeth. Troodontids have sickle-claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian encephalization quotients, meaning they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses. The type fossil is a young juvenile about long, complete and exceptionally well preserved in three- dimensional detail, with the snout nestled beneath one of the forelimbs and the legs neatly folded beneath the body, similar to the roosting position of modern birds. This posture provides another behavioral link between birds and dinosaurs. The chemistry of the matrix stone and the resting pose indicate the living animal was probably buried instantly in volcanic ash. A second specimen, DNHM D2154, was also preserved in a sleeping posture. Mei is notable as a distinct species of troodontid based on several unique features, including extremely large nares. It is most closely related to the troodontid Sinovenator, which places it near the base of the troodontid family. As a basal troodontid, unlike advanced troodontids, it has a bird like hip structure shared with many advanced maniraptorans. Palaeoecology Mei lived in the Early Aptian stage of the Cretaceous period, about 125.8 million years ago. At this time, the Liaoning area was dominated by numerous volcanoes in a landscape that was covered in coniferous forest, with an understory of ferns and other plants like large horsetails. Several other trees were present, such as ginkgos and araucarias. Some of the earliest flowering plants were also found here. Rivers and streams coming down from the flanks of the volcanoes fed into lakes in the valleys. There were many species of small birdlike theropod dinosaurs living in the area, although most of them were slightly larger than Mei. This probably led to a lot of niche partitioning. There were only five or six species of herbivorous non-theropod dinosaurs, however, and a large and varied fauna of early mammals and pterosaurs. The apex predator was the 9-meter-long tyrannosauroid Yutyrannus, which would have preyed on the two or more species of sauropod. Often, volcanoes erupted, entombing animals in ash and suffocating others with carbon monoxide, which accounts for the high level of preservation of fossils. Mei probably fed on small lizards and insects on the forest floor. It probably climbed trees as well to shelter from larger predators, and was probably not omnivorous. Judging by the length of the legs, it was a fast runner. Nothing is known about its nesting habits. When the first fossil of Mei was discovered, scientists were charmed to see the fossil in a birdlike sleeping posture. Mei long means 'sleeping dragon' in Chinese. The animal had probably died from carbon monoxide poisoning, then became entombed in ash.

The word is sometimes used to refer to an individual diamond in the design, but more commonly refers to the overall pattern. Most argyle contains layers of overlapping motifs, adding a sense of three-dimensionality, movement, and texture. Typically, there is an overlay of intercrossing diagonal lines on solid diamonds. The argyle pattern derives from the tartan of Clan Campbell of Argyll in western Scotland, used for kilts and plaids, and from the patterned socks worn by Scottish Highlanders since at least the 17th century (see illustrations in History of the kilt). These were generally known as \\"tartan hose\\". Argyle knitwear became fashionable in Great Britain and then in the United States after the First World War of 1914‚Äì1918. Pringle of Scotland popularised the design, helped by its identification with the Duke of Windsor. Pringle's website says that \\"the iconic Pringle argyle design was developed\\" in the 1920s. The Duke, like others, used this pattern for golf clothing: both for jerseys and for the long socks needed for the plus-fours trouser fashion of the day. As a knitting pattern, argyle is generally accomplished using the intarsia technique. Argyle patterns are occasionally woven.  Contemporary use  Payne Stewart (1957‚Äì1999), who won the U.S. Open in 1991 and 1999 and the PGA championship in 1989, was known for his flashy tams, knickerbockers, and argyle socks. Some sports teams use bright, contemporary interpretations of the argyle pattern. For example the Norwegian men's curling team at the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Garmin- Slipstream professional cycling team, nicknamed the \\"Argyle Armada\\". On 27 April 2013 the professional soccer team Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States announced their third kit of the 2013 season, featuring an argyle pattern. The University of North Carolina has used the argyle pattern for its basketball uniforms since 1991, and introduced it as alternate for all sports uniforms in 2015. The Belgian football team used such design in 1984, and had an updated version of it in 2018.

IL 390 currently connects U.S. Route 20 (US 20, Lake Street) in Hanover Park to the intersection with Illinois Route 83 (IL 83) and Thorndale Avenue in Wood Dale. The only other towns it borders are Schaumburg and Roselle. Construction is underway to extend the road from IL 83 to the western edge of O'Hare International Airport.  Route description  Markers for the Elgin-O'Hare Expressway on Wright Boulevard in Schaumburg IL 390 begins at an interchange with US 20 in Hanover Park and branches off northeastward as a three-lane toll road, traveling over a half-mile-long (0.8 km) bridge over the Metra Milwaukee District West Line tracks, and some wetlands. The highway then enters Cook County from DuPage County and intersects IL 19 (Irving Park Road). At Meacham Road, the highway crosses back south into DuPage County. Continuing east for , IL 390 traverses portions of the suburbs of Schaumburg, Roselle, Medinah, Elk Grove Village, and then intersects with IL 53 before a major interchange with I-290 in Itasca. IL 390 continues east for through Wood Dale, Elk Grove Village (again), and Bensenville, and finally ends at an intersection with IL 83 in Bensenville just short of the west side of O'Hare International Airport. IL 390 is the first route in the state to have all-electronic toll collection; cash is not accepted, and an I-Pass is required.  History  Although the concept of an Elgin‚ÄìO'Hare Expressway dates back to the 1960s, the highway was not seriously considered until the late 1980s. Around that time, congestion was rapidly increasing on local roads, especially US 20 (Lake Street). Although Lake Street was extensively widened prior to the completion of the highway, initially to Glen Ellyn Road and then to the Roselle-Bloomingdale border nearly ten years later, its capacity was still insufficient for the rapidly growing western suburbs. Construction on the highway began around 1991 and was completed two years later. Governor Jim Edgar opened the highway at an afternoon ceremony on November 2, 1993. When the highway first opened, both of its termini had traffic signals with major arterial roads in the area. This arrangement caused large backups during weekday rush hours. According to the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), average daily traffic counts (in 2003) for IL 390 are 39,600 vehicles for the western and around 82,000 to 87,000 cars per day for the remainder. On October 29, 2013, IDOT announced that the highway was re-designated IL 390 at groundbreaking ceremonies for the Elgin‚ÄìO‚ÄôHare Western Access Project. Shortly after, maintenance of the road was transferred to the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA), and toll collection on the existing segment from US 20 in Hanover Park to I-290 in Itasca began in 2016. ISTHA began constructing an eastward extension of IL 390 to a new interchange on the western border of O'Hare International Airport with the planned I-490 connecting I-90 to the north and I-294 to the south. This interchange may also incorporate ramps into a planned western terminal at O'Hare. The official groundbreaking for the expansion took place on October 29, 2013. The first segment of this extension, opened at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on November 1, 2017, stretching from the upgraded interchange with I-290 in Itasca to IL 83 in Bensenville. East of I-290, IL 390 was formerly a four-lane arterial at-grade road known as Thorndale Avenue until its upgrade into an extension of IL 390, along with the interchange with I-290.

It took place on 14 February 1831 near the town of Stoczek ≈Åukowski, near the Brest‚ÄìWarsaw road. Polish troops drove off two regiments of Russian mounted jaegers, inflicting heavy casualties on them in the process. Background The Russian Army commanded by Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch entered Poland on 4 February and started an advance towards Warsaw. 2nd Mounted-Jaeger Division‚Äî2 brigades of 2 regiments, each consisting of 3 troops of 2 squadrons24 squadrons in total‚Äîunder baron Teodor Geismar, who assumed command just 9 days earlier, entered Poland on 13 February and was marching to the Brest road with some 20 10-pounder guns of field artillery attached. The main forces of Field Marshal Dybich were marching towards Warsaw from the direction of Lublin. General J√≥zef Dwernicki, commander of the Polish forces in the area, organised a Polish Division. He managed to gather 14 cavalry squadrons, 3 infantry battalions and 6 3-pounder guns‚Äîapproximately 4,700 men at arms altogether, including 2,200 cavalrymen‚Äîand on 10 February he crossed the Vistula River. At noon of February the 14th Geismar received some information regarding presence of Polish troops under Dwernicki near the town of Stoczek. In his usual style he decided to launch an immediate attack on them. Leaving as support troops his 2nd Brigade‚ÄîArzamas and Tiraspol Mounted- Jaeger Regiments‚Äîwith some 10 guns, he took his 1st Brigade into battle, sending Pereyaslavl Mounted-Jaeger Regiment with 4 guns under supreme command of the 1st Brigade's CO major-general Pashkov by one road to approach Stoczek from north-east, while himself‚Äîwith the Mounted-Jaeger Regiment of the Duke of Wirtemberg and 6 more guns‚Äîtook the eastern root to the town. On the march his troops were separated by the huge forest and were marching by very narrow forest roads. Dwernicki, a seasoned commander, although set his forces already to prepare for the night, kept a strong watch and was informed by fellow Poles of Geismar's approach well in advance. Now understanding clearly the Russians' plan, Dwernicki took his troops out to the field north of Stoczek, put his guns in to line from east to west, his infantry in two big squares on the flanks, one leaning on the thick forest to the west of his position, and his cavalry‚Äîto the south and north of his line, thus enabling them to fight the enemy whatever direction they approach from. There he stood, waiting. \\"Battle\\" In the early twilight the first column to reach the field was Pereyaslavl Regiment from north-east, Pashkov put his guns in line under Polish artillery shelling and dismounted the 1st Troop to protect them from Polish cavalry, then he ordered the 2nd Troop to engage the northern detachment of Polish cavalry. Then the 2nd Troop started on Poles, who, in turn, started on them, and then... without a clash 2nd Troop just turned their backs on Poles and went into forest. The 3rd Troop, still mounted, followed. Narrow road was of little to no help at this point. The 1st Troop and the artillery men, who barely shot their guns, were left to withstand the fierce attack of Polish Uhlans. This was the only battle which really occurred that night. While Polish Uhlans were busy finishing the Russian gunners and dismounted jaegers to the north and north-east of Polish position, Geismar himself arrived to his launch position, put his guns to the north of his troops and‚Äîunaware of the fate of Pashkov's troops‚Äîprepared to send the 3rd Troop of his Regiment into the battle from the south-east. But there was Polish cavalry again‚Äîin close formation and ready for fight. And the history repeated itself‚Äîthe 3rd Troop just started on the Poles but turned back on them without any clash and rode away to safety by the very same road on which they had just arrived. Geismar, deeply shocked by their behaviour, took personal command of the 2nd Troop asking them to join him in the charge, but the 2nd Troop just followed the 3rd. The 1st Troop followed them without hesitation, leaving baron Geismar and some of their officers at the field and been pursued by Polish Uhlans, who visibly enjoyed such a pleasant war. Aftermath=Poles In a quarter of an hour, with 46 killed and 59 wounded‚Äîmostly by several shells which Pashkov's artillery men managed to fire‚ÄîPolish forces achieved the great result of scaring out the two Russian regular cavalry regimentsmost likely, the only time in the entire history of Imperial Russian regular cavalry with some 280 killed, 230 taken prisonermostly from the Pereyaslavl Regiment and gunners and 8 cannon lost. 2 of the cannons Russians were lucky enough to bring to safety due to them been not ready at the time of the Polish attack and still attached to the harness horses. Geismar and Pashkov themselves survived rather by chance. The battle of Stoczek was the first Polish victory in the war and had a tremendous effect on Polish morale. In Warsaw they have had great celebrations with huge fireworks for the entire week. Poles especially enjoyed the fact that Dwernicki won over baron Geismar, whose fame as the greatest Russian vanguard commander was fresh from the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì29). Russians Geismar himself officially wrote to Diebitsch that \\"soldiers were just struck with sudden panic-attack\\", but in his private letter to his friend Colonel Anrep,who was the son of the general Anrep, under whom Geismar has himself began his Russian service who was about to take charge of the Pereyaslvl Mounted-Jaeger Regiment after above-described battle, he expressed great concern regarding the general moral and military capability of the Regiment, bitterly complaining that in all his years of service with Russians, he was always a great admirer of virtues of Russian Soldier‚Äîuntil that very day. He always described this attack as one of his greatest mistakes‚Äîthough not on the battlefield but, rather, in his own estimation of the moral attitude of his troops. They report him saying constantly on the matter: \\"If I would only have been aware of the moral state of my men at the time I launched the operation‚Äîsurely, I wouldn't dare to attack Dwernicki's troops at all, not to discuss 'in such a position.\\" In 1833 Nicolas I of Russia disbanded Mounted- Jaegers as the type of cavalry. People were sent to the other cavalry regiments in accordance with matches of hue of their horses. Literature * Memoire of General Baron Theodore Geismar and comments on them. Vladimir Geismar.

During the ship's 19th voyage, on 1 April 1873, she struck rocks and sank off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, killing at least 535 people. It remained the deadliest civilian maritime disaster in the North Atlantic Ocean until the sinking of on 2 July 1898 and the greatest disaster for the White Star Line prior to the loss of in April 1912. History Atlantic was built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast in 1870, one of four sister ships. The other three were the , and . Atlantic was the second of the sisters. The ships were built for the newly created Oceanic Steamship Navigation Company, commonly referred to as the White Star Line. Her primary propulsion was a four cylinder compound condensing steam engine producing driving a single propeller giving her a speed of . The engines were made by George Forrester and Co at the Vauxhall foundry, Liverpool. To communicate from the bridge to the engine room she was fitted with a telegraph. Steering was by Forrester's steam steering apparatus, as fitted to the . For auxiliary propulsion she was rigged as a four-masted barque. With a length of between perpendiculars ( overall) and a beam of she was slim with an aspect ration of 1:10. She had a depth of hold of and was 3,707 tons register. She had three decks and five bulkheads extending from keelson to maindeck. The four liners were luxurious with a standard unseen on any previous vessel. Two classes of accommodation were available. Cabin class was amidships with a saloon measuring long and the full of the ship's beam. The staterooms were forward of the saloon with provision for four berth en suite accommodation as well as double cabins. The lavatories were provided with running water and the bathrooms had water heated by steam when required. Cabin class passengers were free to come on deck. There was also provision for 1,000 steerage passengers. Single males were housed forward of the cabin class area, aft of cabin class was reserved for single females and married couples. Steerage class passengers did not have access to the decks. She sailed for New York City on her maiden voyage on 8 June 1871. For her return trip (starting on 1 July 1871) she was advertised for all classes as being \\"unrivalled in safety, speed and comfort\\". She carried \\"surgeons and stewardesses\\". Atlantic completed 18 crossings with no problems other than a minor incident in 1871 when she was hit by the SS Alexandria. Disaster Quartermaster John Speakman led a number of survivors ashore by swimming to nearby rocks, creating a link from the vessel to land John Hindley, the only child survivor of the Atlantic On 20 March 1873 Atlantic departed on her 19th voyage from Liverpool with 952 people on board, of whom 835 were passengers, 2 of whom were babies born during the voyage, and 14 stowaways. En route, because of heavy seas and strong headwinds slowing their progress, Captain Williams became concerned that they would run out of coal for the boilers before reaching New York. They in fact had more than enough remaining fuel, but the ship's engineer had been purposefully under-reporting coal reserves to increase the margin for error in favor of safety. Thus convinced they were short of coal‚Äîand unable to hoist sail as a backup because of the strong headwind‚Äîthe captain decided to divert to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to refuel. During the approach to Halifax on the evening of 31 March, the captain and third officer were on the bridge until midnight while Atlantic made her way through a storm, proceeding at for the entrance of Halifax harbour, experiencing intermittent visibility and heavy seas. Unbeknownst to the crew or passengers, winds and currents had put Atlantic approximately off-course to the west of Halifax Harbour. Because almost none of the crew had ever been to Halifax before, they were unaware of the dangers of the approach; no one took soundings, posted a masthead lookout, reduced speed, or woke the captain as they approached the unfamiliar coast. They did not spot the Sambro Lighthouse, the large landfall lighthouse which warns mariners of the rocky shoals to the west of the harbour entrance. As the night wore on without any sight of the lighthouse, the helmsman‚Äîthe only crew member familiar with Halifax‚Äîbecame convinced that something was wrong, and relayed his concerns to the officers on duty, but was ultimately ignored. At 3:15 a.m. local time on 1 April 1873, Atlantic struck an underwater rock off Marr's Head, Meagher's Island (now Mars Head, Mars Island), Nova Scotia.Author Unknown \\"Mars Island History\\", Retrieved on 21 March 2013.Author Unknown \\"Mars Island Map\\", Retrieved on 21 March 2013.Clancy, Dave \\"Shipwrecks of Nova Scotia\\", Retrieved on 21 March 2013. All 10 lifeboats were lowered by the crew but were all washed away or smashed as the ship quickly filled with water and partially capsized. Survivors were forced to swim or climb ropes first to a wave-swept rock and then to a barren shore. Residents of the tiny fishing village of Lower Prospect and Terence Bay soon arrived to rescue and shelter the survivors, but at least 535 people died, leaving only 371 survivors.. Estimates range from 535 to 560 lives lost. The official Inquiry in Halifax concluded that 535 people had perished. Exact numbers were difficult to determine due to changes in the passenger list and misspelling of names. The ship's manifest indicates that of the 952 aboard, 156 were women and 189 were children (including two who had been born during the voyage). All women and all children perished except for one twelve-year-old boy, John Hindley. Ten crew members were lost, while 131 survived. This was the worst civilian loss of life in the North Atlantic until the wreck of La Bourgogne on 2 July 1898. The Canadian government inquiry concluded with the statement, \\"the conduct of Captain Williams in the management of his ship during the twelve or fourteen hours preceding the disaster, was so gravely at variance with what ought to have been the conduct of a man placed in his responsible position.\\" Recovery of the dead Winslow Homer drawing of an Atlantic victim cast up by the sea Wreck of Atlantic during body and cargo recovery, April 1873 Lower Prospect, Halifax County, N.S. Recovery and burial of the large numbers of victims took weeks. Divers were paid rewards for recovering the many bodies trapped within the hull. According to one newspaper account, a body of one of the crew members was discovered to be that of a woman disguised as a man. \\"She was about twenty or twenty-five years old and had served as a common sailor for three voyages, and her sex was never known until the body was washed ashore and prepared for burial. She is described as having been a great favorite with all her shipmates, and one of the crew, speaking of her, remarked: 'I didn't know Bill was a woman. He used to take his grog as regular as any of us, and was always begging or stealing tobacco. He was a good fellow, though, and I am sorry he was a woman.\\"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, 26 April 1873 Legacy The Wreck of the \\"Atlantic\\" -- Breakfast to Survivors in Faneuil Hall, Boston, 1873 engraving SS Atlantic was the second liner commissioned by White Star ( being first) but carried the notoriety of being the first White Star Line steamer to sink. (The company had previously lost the clipper in Dublin Bay in 1854.) Other White Star Line ships lost in the North Atlantic include in 1893, in 1909, and Titanic in 1912. Today, most of the ship lies heavily fragmented under of water. Artifacts recovered from several salvage operations are on display at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia and also at the SS Atlantic Heritage Park and Interpretation Centre, in Terence Bay, Nova Scotia. A monument to the wreck is located at the mass grave near the interpretation centre in the Terence Bay Anglican Cemetery, while a smaller monument marks a second mass grave at the Catholic cemetery. When the 1929 film Atlantic was released, everyone knew it was a thinly disguised story about the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Though this film was based on a stage play it also was made only seventeen years after the actual Titanic sinking and the public, especially survivors and their families, felt uncomfortable with a direct reference to Titanic. The producers of the film decided to release the movie under the title Atlantic, apparently unaware of the previous White Star Line disaster. P.G. Wodehouse wrote a story in 1921 called \\"The Girl On The Boat\\" in which six chapters of the romance take place on a White Star liner he named \\"Atlantic\\", crossing from New York to Southampton. As the real \\"Atlantic\\" disaster had occurred 48 years before the story and 8 years before he was born, it is unlikely that he knew about it.

As did its predecessors, the series combined two types of characters: conventional actors in makeup filmed alongside performers in full mascot costumes, whose voices were dubbed in post-production. Seventeen episodes aired on Saturday mornings for two seasons, 1971-1973. The opening was shot at Six Flags Over Texas. Otherwise, the show was shot at Paramount Pictures film studio in Los Angeles. Production Lidsville resembles an earlier British series, Hattytown Tales, produced by Hattyland Enterprises & FilmFair Ltd. in 1969, which used an almost identical concept but different characters and was produced in stop motion animation. Like predecessors H.R. Pufnstuf and The Bugaloos, Lidsville ran for only one season (1971‚Äì1972), with reruns airing the following year (1972‚Äì1973). Also like H.R. Pufnstuf, Lidsville's title and subject matter were often interpreted as references to drug use: the word \\"lid\\" is slang for a hat or cap (as in \\"flip your lid\\"), but \\"lid\\" is also early-1970s slang for an ounce of cannabis (marijuana). Like most children's television shows of its era, Lidsville contained a laugh track. Plot The show involved a teenage boy named Mark (Butch Patrick) who fell into the hat of Merlo the Magician (Charles Nelson Reilly) following his show at Six Flags Over Texas and arrived in Lidsville, a land of living hats. The hats on the show are depicted as having the same characteristics as the humans who would normally wear them. For example, a cowboy hat would act and speak like a cowboy. The characters' houses were also hat-shaped. Mark (Butch Patrick) helps the hats defeat HooDoo. The villain of the show was a magician named Horatio J. HooDoo (also played by Charles Nelson Reilly in a magician's costume and make-up). The vain, short-tempered, but somewhat naive HooDoo flew around in his Hatamaran, blasting the good citizens of Lidsville with bolts of magic (referred to as \\"zapping\\") and keeping them in fear, demanding that they pay him their Hat Tax. Mark helped the good hats resist as he attempted to find a way back home. HooDoo, trying to reclaim control of the androgynous Weenie the Genie from Mark, often enlisted the services of four Bad Hats. Mark was seen as a suspected spy against HooDoo on behalf of the good hat people and was captured at Derby Dunes by HooDoo's minions the Bad Hats the moment he had fallen into the world of Lidsville. He escapes from his clutches alongside a genie named Weenie (Billie Hayes). In his high hat home, HooDoo was besieged by the taunting music of the Hat Band, as well as all of his talking knicknacks (the parrot, Mr. Skull, the mounted alligator head, the sawed-in-half lady, etc.). HooDoo also experienced further aggravation at the hands of his aides, the dimwitted Raunchy Rabbit and his two-faced card guard Jack of Clubs. HooDoo watched the action going on in downtown Lidsville from his hat home by using his Evil Eye, a device similar to a TV set that resembled an eyeball. He also had a hot chatline phone. The show relied on an endless array of puns based on hats. One such pun was \\"Derby Dunes,\\" an area in Lidsville which sand dunes were shaped like derby hats. Many of the episodes were about Mark trying to get back home, but the evil HooDoo prevented him from leaving. Weenie, being a nervous bumbler, was in fact a genie, but many of the tricks and spells did not work correctly anymore after being a slave to HooDoo for so long. In the show's final episode, scenes from some of the past episodes were featured as HooDoo's mother (played by Muriel Landers, but not listed in the closing credits) had paid a visit to find out what has been going on in Lidsville while making sure that her son is still bad. Unfortunately for Mark, he did not return home at the end. Music was also a part of the show, with songs being performed by the characters in several episodes.

He currently lives in Bethesda, Maryland with his wife and son.  Concepts = Folksonomy  Vander Wal is credited with coining the term ‚Äúfolksonomy‚Äô in 2004. Folksonomy is sometimes called collaborative tagging, social classification, social indexing, or social tagging. It refers to taxonomies created by users applying their own tags to pieces of information (including articles, pictures, and websites). The tags aid users in categorizing information for both personal management and sharing with others. These user generated taxonomies stand in contrast to professionally created ontologies and taxonomies used for resource discovery and retrieval in more traditional knowledge organization systems.  Personal InfoCloud  The Personal InfoCloud is the information that a user collects, organizes, and carries with them, a bit like your personal slice of the web. Instead of focusing on very large and relatively public social spaces on the internet, the Personal InfoCloud represents a desire to use the internet to connect to a small group of people on a more personal level, and keep specific information accessible to that group. The point here is that the information needs to be accessible to the user in a very short amount of time. Thus, aggregation, personal organization and portability all flow from the need for accessibility. Vander Wal links the Personal InfoCloud to concepts like personal archiving, information overload, and what he calls the ‚ÄúCome to Me Web‚Äù.  Model of Attraction  Much of his work, including the Personal InfoCloud and folksonomies, is undergirded by what he calls the Model of Attraction. MoA is a metaphor, much like navigation or sense of smell, that helps information architects and web developers think about the way that users interact with information. To think about MoA in relation to folksonomies, certain terms are associated with different pieces of information. The strength of the association can be visualized as a magnetic field, bringing certain kinds of information around a term. When a user searches on that term, they enter into the magnetic field. To think about MoA in relation to the Personal InfoCloud, a user‚Äôs associated information and interests create a similar magnetic field, which draws pertinent information to them, and keeps it around them.

It, along with its broker- dealer, banking and other financial services subsidiaries, provides investment, financing and related services to individual, institutional and government customers on a global basis with an emphasis on securities businesses. History=Origins The history of Nomura began on December 25, 1925, when Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. (NSC) was established in Osaka, as a spin-off from Securities Dept. of Osaka Nomura Bank Co., Ltd (the present day Resona Bank). NSC initially focused on the bond market. It was named after its founder Tokushichi Nomura II, a wealthy Japanese businessman and investor. He had earlier established Osaka Nomura bank in 1918, based on the Mitsui zaibatsu model with a capital of ¬•10 million. Like the majority of Japanese conglomerates, or zaibatsu, its origins were in Osaka, but today operates out of Tokyo. NSC gained the authority to trade stock in 1938, and went public in 1961. Lehman Brothers Acquisition In October 2008, Nomura acquired most of Lehman Brothers Asian operations together with its European equities and investment banking units to make one of the world's largest independent investment banks with Y20,300bn (¬£138bn) assets under management. In April 2009, the global headquarters for investment banking was moved out of Tokyo to London as part of a strategy to move the company's focus from Japan to global markets, with Josh Tokley appointed Head of UK Investments. Following his subsequent suspension, Tokley was replaced by Michael Coombs. Nomura paid $225 million for the purchase of Lehman's Asian-Pacific unit. Nomura Buys Lehman's Europe Banking, Equities Units , Bloomberg, September 23, 2008 Due to large losses with shares dropping to their lowest level in nearly 37 years, Nomura cut around 5 percent of its staff in Europe (as many as 500 people) in mid- September 2011. Ethics In September 2011, it was announced that Trent Martin was hired as a Vice President, Sales. In December 2012, Martin faced an extradition request in Hong Kong from the U.S. for alleged insider-trading, securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. The extradition request was not contested. Greentech Acquisition In December 2019, Nomura announced that it would acquire Greentech Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank with stated aims of assisting clients across sustainable technology and infrastructure. The transaction is expected to close on March 31, 2020.

There are two varieties: white (or plain), and red (Á∫¢ÁÉß, cooked with soy sauce). The plain variety is usually stewed or steamed with napa cabbage. The red variety can be stewed with cabbage or cooked with bamboo shoots and tofu derivatives. The minced meat rich in fat is more likely to bring better texture, addition of chopped water chestnut also works. The name \\"lion's head\\", derives from the shape of the meatball which is supposed to resemble the head of the Chinese guardian lion, specifically. The dish originated in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, to a lesser degree, Huai'an, while the plain variety is more common in Yangzhou and the red variety more common in Zhenjiang. The dish became a part of Shanghai cuisine with the influx of migrants in the 19th and early 20th century. The dish can also be prepared with beefBBC Food recipe or be made as a vegetarian dish.

It is typically written in the formal, third-person language and mailed five to eight weeks before the wedding date. Like any other invitation, it is the privilege and duty of the host‚Äîhistorically, for younger brides in Western culture, the mother of the bride, on behalf of the bride's family‚Äîto issue invitations, either by sending them herself or causing them to be sent, either by enlisting the help of relatives, friends, or her social secretary to select the guest list and address envelopes, or by hiring a service. With computer technology, some are able to print directly on envelopes from a guest list using a mail merge with word processing and spreadsheet software. History=The Middle Ages and before Prior to the invention of the moveable-type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1447, weddings in England were typically announced by means of a Town crier: a man who would walk through the streets announcing in a loud voice the news of the day. Traditionally, anyone within earshot became part of the celebration. In the Middle Ages, illiteracy was widespread among common people, so the practice of sending written wedding invitations emerged among the nobility. Families of means would commission monks, skilled in the art of calligraphy, to hand-craft their notices. Such documents often carried the coat of arms, or personal crest, of the individual and were sealed with wax. From 1600 onward Despite the emergence of the printing press, the ordinary printing techniques of the time, in which ink was simply stamped onto the paper using lead type, produced too poor a result for stylish invitations. However, the tradition of announcing weddings in the newspaper did become established at this time. In 1642, the invention of metal-plate engraving (or Mezzotint) by Ludwig von Siegen brought higher-quality wedding invitations within the reach of the emerging middle class.Griffiths, Antony (ed), Landmarks in Print Collecting - Connoisseurs and Donors at the British Museum since 1753, p. 138, 1996, British Museum Press, Engraving, as the name implies, requires an artisan to \\"hand write\\" the text in reverse onto a metal plate using a carving tool, and the plate was then used to print the invitation. The resulting engraved invitations were protected from smudging by a sheet of tissue paper placed on top, which is a tradition that remains to this day. At the time, the wording of wedding invitations was more elaborate than today; typically, the name of each guest was individually printed on the invitation. The Industrial Revolution Following the invention of Lithography by Alois Senefelder in 1798, it became possible to produce very sharp and distinctive inking without the need for engraving. This paved the way for the emergence of a genuine mass-market in wedding invitations. Wedding invitations were still delivered by hand and on horseback, however, due to the unreliability of the nascent postal system. A ‚Äòdouble envelope‚Äô was used to protect the invitation from damage en route to its recipient. This tradition remains today, despite advances in postal reliability. Modern times The origins of commercially printed 'fine wedding stationery' can be traced to the period immediately following World War II, where a combination of democracy and rapid industrial growth gave the common man the ability to mimic the lifestyles and materialism of society's elite. About this time, prominent society figures, such as Amy Vanderbilt and Emily Post, emerged to advise the ordinary man and woman on appropriate etiquette. Growth in the use of wedding stationery was also underpinned by the development of thermography. Although it lacks the fineness and distinctiveness of engraving, thermography is a less expensive method of achieving raised type. This technique often called poor man's engraving, produces shiny, raised lettering without impressing the surface of the paper (in the way traditional engraving does). As such, wedding invitations - either printed or engraved - finally became affordable for all. More recently Letterpress printing has made a strong resurgence in popularity for wedding invitations. It has a certain boutique and craft appeal due to the deep impression or bite that can be achieved. It was not the original intent of letterpress to bite into the paper in this way, but rather to kiss it creating a flat print. The bite or deep impression is a recent aesthetic that adds the sensory experience of touch to letterpress printed wedding invitations. Many letterpress printers that specialize in wedding invitations are small start-ups or artisan printers, rather than large printing companies. Laser engraving has also been making headway in the wedding invitation market over the last few years. Primarily used for engraving wood veneer invitations, it is also used to engrave acrylic or to mark certain types of metal invitations. The latest trend in wedding invitations is to order them online. Using the internet has made viewing, organizing and ordering wedding invitations an easy task. There are hundreds of websites that offer wedding invitations and stationery and being online allows the customer to order from anywhere in the world. Text Etiquette regarding the text on a formal wedding invitation varies according to country, culture and language. In Western countries, a formal invitation is typically written in the formal, third-person language, saying that the hosts wish for the recipient to attend the wedding and giving its date, time, and place. Even in countries like India, where the concept of wedding invitations was acquired through the British, the language continues to follow western traditions. As the bride's parents are traditionally the hosts of the wedding, the text commonly begins with the names of the bride's parents as they use them in formal social contexts, e.g., \\"Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith\\" or \\"Dr. Mary Jones and Mr. John Smith\\". The exact wording varies, but a typical phrasing runs as follows: A modern wedding invitation > Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith > request the honor of your presence > at the wedding of their daughter > Jessica Marie > to > Mr. Michael Francis Miller > on the first of November > at twelve noon > Christchurch Hall > Richmond, Virginia > Note the seemingly anglicized spelling 'honour'; this derives from a ruling laid down by Emily Post in the 1920s. In the United States, the line \\"request...presence\\" is used when the ceremony is held in a house of worship; \\"pleasure of your company\\" is used when it is held elsewhere. If the groom's parents are also hosts of the wedding, then their names may be added as well. If the parents are not the hosts of the wedding, then the host's name is substituted in the first line, or, especially if the bride and groom are themselves the hosts, it may be written in the passive voice: \\"The honour of your presence is requested at the wedding of...\\" Formal announcements, sent after the wedding ceremony, omit the time and sometimes the place, but usually retain the same general form. Informal invitations, appropriate to less formal weddings, are issued by word of mouth or by hand-written letter. So long as they convey the necessary practical information about the time and place, there is no set form for these invitations. Printing and design Commercial wedding invitations are typically printed using one of the following methods: engraving, lithography, thermography, letterpress printing, sometimes blind embossing, compression plate process, or offset printing. More recently, many do-it-yourself brides are printing on their home computers using a laser printer or inkjet printer. For the artistically inclined, they can be handmade or written in calligraphy. Historically, wedding invitations were hand-written unless the length of the guest list made this impractical. When mass- production was necessary, engraving was preferred over the only other widely available then option, which was a relatively poor quality of letterpress printing. Hand-written invitations, in the hosts' own handwriting, are still considered most correct whenever feasible; these invitations follow the same formal third-person form as printed ones for formal weddings and take the form of a personal letter for less formal weddings. Marriage invitation cover Tissues are often provided by manufacturers to place over the printed text. Originally, the purpose of the tissue was to reduce smudging or blotting, especially on invitations poorly printed or hastily mailed before the ink was fully dried, but improved printing techniques mean they are now simply decorative.Elizabeth Post, Emily Post on Weddings, page 65. 1987. Those who know that their original purpose has been made irrelevant by dramatic improvements in printing technology usually discard them.Martin, Judith. Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium. Simon and Schuster; 1990-11-15 [cited 17 September 2012]. . p. 662. Modern invitation design follows fashion trends. Invitations are generally chosen to match the couple's personal preferences, the level of formality of the event, and any color scheme or planned theme. For example, a casual beach wedding may have light, fresh colors and beach-related graphics. A formal church wedding may have more scripty typefaces and lots of ornamentation that matches the formal nature of the event. The design of the invitation is becoming less and less traditional and more reflective of the couple's personality. Some web-based print-on- demand companies now allow couples to design or customize their own wedding invitations. An example of a foil modern wedding invitation More recently in 2019, foil stamping and foil sleeking invitations have come back into trend. Foil sleeking is applied by applying a thick layer of toner to a paper using all four CMYK colours and a fifth white colour, next the card is fed through a foil heat transfer machine where the foil sticks to the toner and design. The invitation is typically a note card, folded in half, or perhaps French folded (folded twice, into quarters). Other options include a sheet of paper, a tri- fold, or a trendy pocket-fold design. The appropriate paper density depends on the design but typically ranges from heavy paper to very stiff card stock. There are also acrylic invitations. Mailing Traditionally, wedding invitations are mailed in double envelopes. The inner envelope may be lined, is not gummed, and fits into the outer envelope. The outer envelope is gummed for sealing and addressing. More recently, the inner envelope is often left out in the interest of saving money, paper, and postage. In some cases, a pocketfold takes the place of an inner envelope. In countries that issue them, the envelope may be franked with love stamps. The United States postal service issues a love stamp each year specifically denominated to cover the double weight of the invitation and reply (a rate slightly less than the cost of two regular stamps). Response As with any invitation, the sole obligation of the person receiving it is to respond, as promptly as reasonably possible, to let the hosts know whether or not he will be able to attend. Receiving a wedding invitation does not obligate the recipient either to attend the wedding or to send a gift. A proper response is written on the recipient's normal stationery, following the form of the invitation. For example, if the invitation uses formal, third-person language, then the recipient replies in formal, third-person language, saying either \\"Mr. Robert Jones accepts with pleasure the kind invitation to the wedding on the first of November\\", or \\"Ms. Susan Brown regrets that she is unable to attend the wedding on the first of November.\\" Pre-printed, pre-addressed, pre-stamped response cards are frequently sent in the hope of encouraging a greater proportion of invited people to respond to the invitation. Some American etiquette experts consider the practice incorrect and ineffective at increasing response rates. Other items In addition to the invitation itself, sellers promote a full panoply of optional printed materials. The ensemble may include an RSVP response card, a separate invitation to a wedding reception, and information such as maps, directions, childcare options, and hotel accommodations. Wedding invitations should be sent out 6‚Äì8 weeks prior to a wedding with slightly more time being given for out of town or destination weddings. Guests should be asked to have their reply given between 3 and 2 weeks before the wedding date. Although many couples request RSVPs to be returned up to a month prior to the wedding day. These printers also sell matching pieces intended for the day of the wedding, such as programs, menus, table cards, place cards as well as wedding favors and party favors such as napkins, coasters, cocktail stirrers and matchboxes. thumb In pop culture In \\"The Invitations\\" episode of Seinfeld, George Costanza's fianc√©e Susan is killed by licking toxic wedding invitations that George picked out because they were inexpensive.

He is remembered for his teaching work as a professor at Georgetown University, and for his speculations about global conspiracies concerning their attempts to spread certain values globally.  Life and career  Born in Boston, Quigley attended Harvard University, where he studied history and earned B.A, M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. He taught at Princeton University, and then at Harvard, and then from 1941 to 1976 at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. From 1941 until 1972, he taught a two-semester course at Georgetown on the development of civilizations. According to his obituary in The Washington Star, many alumni of Georgetown's School of Foreign Service asserted that this was \\"the most influential course in their undergraduate careers\\". In addition to his academic work, Quigley served as a consultant to the U.S. Department of Defense, the United States Navy, the Smithsonian Institution, and the House Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration in the 1950s. He was also a book reviewer for The Washington Star, and a contributor and editorial board member of Current History. Quigley retired from Georgetown in June 1976 after being honored by the student body with its Faculty Award for the fourth consecutive year. He died the following year at Georgetown University Hospital following a heart attack. Major conclusionsInclusive diversity= Quigley's work emphasized inclusive diversity as a core value of Western civilization, contrasting it with the dualism of Plato. He concluded the book Tragedy and Hope with the hope that the West could \\"resume its development along its old patterns of Inclusive Diversity\\". From his study of history, \\"it is clear that the West believes in diversity rather than in uniformity, in pluralism rather than in monism or dualism, in inclusion rather than exclusion, in liberty rather than in authority, in truth rather than in power, in conversion rather than in annihilation, in the individual rather than in the organization, in reconciliation rather than in triumph, in heterogeneity rather than in homogeneity, in relativisms rather than in absolutes, and in approximations rather than in final answers.\\" Quigley asserts that any intolerance or rigidity in the religious practices of the West are aberrations from its nature of inclusivity and diversity. Quigley points to the tolerance and flexibility in Aquinas's belief that theological truth is revealed over time through dialogue within the Christian community, which allows the community to adapt to a changing world., quoted on p1230 of Tragedy and HopeHarry J Hogan, p18 of the foreword to =Institutionalization and the fall of civilizations= Having studied the rise and fall of civilizations, \\"Quigley found the explanation of disintegration in the gradual transformation of social 'instruments' into 'institutions,' that is, transformation of social arrangements functioning to meet real social needs into social institutions serving their own purposes regardless of real social needs\\".Harry J Hogan in the foreword (p17) and Quigley in the conclusion (p416) to =Weapons and democracy= From a historical study of weapons and political dynamics, Quigley concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy.Foreword, written by historian Harry J Hogan in 1982, to Quigley's Weapons Systems and Political Stabilitysee also Chester G Starr, Review of Weapons Systems and Political Stability, American Historical Review, Feb 1984, p98, available at carrollquigley.net Democracy tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to buy and use. This explains why democracy occurs so rarely in human history. In the 1800s (peaking in the 1880s), guns were the best weapon available. In America, almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily. Governments couldn't do any better: it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns. (Similarly, Periclean Greece was an age of the citizen soldier and of democracy). In the 1900s, expensive, specialist weapons (such as tanks and bombers) became available, and citizen soldiers became dominated by specialist soldiers. Quigley notes that the slaughter of World War I (1914-1918) was due to the mismatch between the traditional armies (citizen soldiers) and the available weapons (machine guns used defensively). Style Quigley's writing style is dense, influenced by a former history professor of his: > \\"As we raced along, Goethe was covered in fifteen minutes, Schiller in ten, > Fichte in five...he covered any topic simply by slicing it up into a small > number of parts and giving a name to each part. The complex character and > achievement of Goethe, for example, were divided into six portions, each was > given a title, and, ever after, the whole of Goethe could be evoked merely > by reciting six words...I should like to outdare even my former professor by > dividing this greater complexity [Classical culture] into only five > parts.\\"Evolution of Civilizations, pp278-9 Quigley's analytical style is scientific, stemming from his earlier training in physics.foreword (by Harry J Hogan) to Evolution of Civilizations, pp.13-14see also Evolution of Civilizations, chapter 1: Scientific Method and the Social Sciences > In this book we are concerned with the social sciences...and particularly > with the effort to apply a scientific method of observation, formulation of > hypotheses, and testing to such phenomena.

Evolution of Civilizations, p.47 Influence on Bill Clinton In his freshman year (1965) in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown, future U.S. President Bill Clinton took Quigley's course, receiving a 'B' as his final grade in both semesters (an excellent grade in a course where nearly half the students received D or lower). In 1991, Clinton named Quigley as an important influence on his aspirations and political philosophy, when Clinton launched his presidential campaign in a speech at Georgetown. He mentioned Quigley again during his acceptance speech to the 1992 Democratic National Convention, as follows: > As a teenager, I heard John Kennedy's summons to citizenship. And then, as a > student at Georgetown, I heard that call clarified by a professor named > Carroll Quigley, who said to us that America was the greatest Nation in > history because our people had always believed in two things-that tomorrow > can be better than today and that every one of us has a personal moral > responsibility to make it so.  Quigley and the Round Table group  One distinctive feature of Quigley's historical writings is his assertion that the Round Table movement have played a significant role in recent world history. His writing on this topic has made Quigley famous among many who investigate conspiracy theories.  Quigley's claims about the Milner Group  In his book The Anglo-American Establishment: From Rhodes to Cliveden (written in 1949 and published posthumously in 1981),. Quigley purports to trace the history of a secret society. He uses no footnotes and does not show his sources. He focuses on the Round Table group founded in 1891 by Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner. Quigley argues that \\"The organization was so modified and so expanded by Milner after the eclipse of Stead in 1899, and especially after the death of Rhodes in 1902, that it took on quite a different organization and character, although it continued to pursue the same goals.\\"The Anglo-American Establishment, ch.1 Quigley greatly admired the British Empire and lamented that the secret society was not very successful. Robert Rotberg states: :But Quigley was not opposed to what Rhodes and Milner had purportedly tried to accomplish. Indeed, Quigley wrote more in remorse at what had failed than in antagonism to what he believed were their mutual efforts at extending the British Empire,\\"Robert I. Rotberg, \\"Did Cecil Rhodes Really Try to Control the World?.\\" Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 42.3 (2014): 551-567 at p. 554. The society consisted of an inner circle (\\"The Society of the Elect\\") and an outer circle (\\"The Association of Helpers\\", also known as The Milner Kindergarten and the Round Table Group).] The society as a whole does not have a fixed name: > This society has been known at various times as Milner's Kindergarten, as > the Round Table Group, as the Rhodes crowd, as The Times crowd, as the All > Souls group, and as the Cliveden set. ... I have chosen to call it the > Milner group. Those persons who have used the other terms, or heard them > used, have not generally been aware that all these various terms referred to > the same Group...this Group is, as I shall show, one of the most important > historical facts of the twentieth century. Quigley assigns this group primary or exclusive credit for several historical events: the Jameson Raid, the Second Boer War, the founding of the Union of South Africa, the replacement of the British Empire with the Commonwealth of Nations, and a number of Britain's foreign policy decisions in the twentieth century. In 1966, Quigley published a one-volume history of the twentieth century, titled Tragedy and Hope. At several points in this book, the history of the Milner group is discussed. Moreover, Quigley states that he has recently been in direct contact with this organization, whose nature he contrasts to right-wing claims of a communist conspiracy: > This radical Right fairy tale, which is now an accepted folk myth in many > groups in America, pictured the recent history of the United States, in > regard to domestic reform and in foreign affairs, as a well-organized plot > by extreme Left-wing elements ... This myth, like all fables, does in fact > have a modicum of truth. There does exist, and has existed for a generation, > an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the > way the Radical right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, > which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to > cooperating with the Communists, or any other group, and frequently does so. > I know of the operation of this network because I have studied it for twenty > years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its > papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims > and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its > instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its > policies... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes > to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough > to be known. According to Quigley, the leaders of this group were Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner from 1891 until Rhodes' death in 1902, Milner alone until his own death in 1925, Lionel Curtis from 1925 to 1955, Robert H. (Baron) Brand from 1955 to 1963, and Adam D. Marris from 1963 until the time Quigley wrote his book. This organization also functioned through certain loosely affiliated \\"front groups\\", including the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Institute of Pacific Relations, and the Council on Foreign Relations. In addition, other secret societies are briefly discussed in Tragedy and Hope, including a consortium of the leaders of the central banks of several countries, who formed the Bank for International Settlements. Historian Robert Rotberg reports that, \\"Unfortunately, Tragedy and Hope lacks the usual scholarly apparatus. It cites nothing.\\"Rotberg, \\"Did Cecil Rhodes Really Try to Control the World?\\" p. 553.  Citations of Quigley in expos√©s of purported conspiracies  Soon after its publication, Tragedy and Hope caught the attention of authors interested in conspiracies. They proceeded to publicize Quigley's claims, disseminating them to a much larger audience than his original readership. This began in 1970, when W. Cleon Skousen published The Naked Capitalist: A Review and Commentary on Dr. Carroll Quigley's Book \\"Tragedy and Hope\\". The first third of this book consists of extensive excerpts from Tragedy and Hope, interspersed with commentary by Skousen. Skousen quotes Quigley's description of the activities of several groups ‚Äî the Milner Group, a cartel of international bankers, the Communist Party, the Institute of Pacific Relations, and the Council on Foreign Relations. According to Skousen's interpretation of Quigley's book, each of these is a facet of one large conspiracy. The following year, G. Edward Griffin released the documentary The Capitalist Conspiracy: An Inside View of International Banking, crediting the Skousen book: \\"We wish to acknowledge that this film was insipred by Cleon Skousen's book, The Naked Capitalist, which we believe is one of the most important documents of the decade.\\" Quigley responded directly to Skousen in a review stating that Skousen \\"has echoes of the original Nazi 25 point program.\\"https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp- content/uploads/sbi/issues/V06N0304.pdf, p.110 In 1971, Gary Allen, a spokesman for the John Birch Society, published None Dare Call It Conspiracy, which became a bestseller. Allen cited Quigley's Tragedy and Hope as an authoritative source on conspiracies throughout his book. Like Skousen, Allen understood the various conspiracies in Quigley's book to be branches of one large conspiracy, and also connected them to the Bilderbergers and to Richard Nixon. Quigley is cited on pp. 12-13, 39, 42, 57, 59, 79-82, 85; his photo is on p. 52. The John Birch Society continues to cite Quigley as a primary source for their view of history.For example, a quotation from Quigley is displayed on the back cover of Quigley is also cited by several other authors who assert the existence of powerful conspiracies. Jim Marrs, whose work was used as a source by Oliver Stone in his film JFK, cites Quigley in his book Rule By Secrecy, which describes a conspiracy linking the Milner Group, Skull and Bones, the Trilateral Commission, the Bavarian Illuminati, the Knights Templar, and aliens who posed as the Sumerian gods thousands of years ago. Quigley is cited on pp. 7, 84, 86-89, 109. Pat Robertson's book The New World Order cites Quigley as an authority on a powerful conspiracy. Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly has asserted that Bill Clinton's political success was due to his pursuit of the \\"world government\\" agenda he learned from Quigley. G. Edward Griffin relies heavily on Quigley for information about the role Milner's secret society plays in the Federal Reserve in his book The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve. Quigley was dismissive of the authors who used his writings to support theories of a world domination conspiracy. Of W. Cleon Skousen's The Naked Capitalist he stated: > Skousen's book is full of misrepresentations and factual errors. He claims > that I have written of a conspiracy of the super-rich who are pro-Communist > and wish to take over the world and that I'm a member of this group. But I > never called it a conspiracy and don't regard it as such. I'm not an > \\"insider\\" of these rich persons, although Skousen thinks so. I happen to > know some of them and liked them, although I disagreed with some of the > things they did before 1940. On Gary Allen's None Dare Call It Conspiracy he said: > They thought Dr. Carroll Quigley proved everything. For example, they > constantly misquote me to this effect: that Lord Milner (the dominant > trustee of the Cecil Rhodes Trust and a heavy in the Round Table Group) > helped finance the Bolsheviks. I have been through the greater part of > Milner's private papers and have found no evidence to support that. Further, > None Dare Call It Conspiracy insists that international bankers were a > single bloc, were all powerful and remain so today. I, on the contrary, > stated in my book that they were much divided, often fought among > themselves, had great influence but not control of political life and were > sharply reduced in power about 1931-1940, when they became less influential > than monopolized industry.  Criticism  F. William Engdahl, in an overview of financial imperialism entitled The Gods of Money, criticized Quigley for stating that the power of international bankers declined in the 1930s, and insofar as the influence of international bankers in America was concerned, suggested that Quigley was confusing \\"international finance\\" with Morgan interests. He suggested, like Sutton, that Quigley's papers had been vetted. Engdahl argued that it was not the case that the power of \\"international finance\\" declined, but rather, Morgan interests fell and were replaced by Rockefeller interests.Engdahl, F. William. The Gods of Money: Wall Street and the Death of the American Century. Wiesbaden, Germany: Edition.engdahl, 2009. pp. 81-135 Quigley stated that the intentions and objectives of the group he profiled, associated with Wall Street and the City of London and Cecil Rhodes' super-imperialism, were \\"largely commendable\\". Members of the group, in statements recorded by the New York Times in 1902, proclaimed that they formed their society for the purpose of \\"gradually absorbing the wealth of the world\\". Quigley argued that the Round Table groups were not World Government advocates but super-imperialists. He stated that they emphatically did not want the League of Nations to become a World Government. Yet Lionel Curtis, who, according to Quigley, was one of the leaders of the Round Table movement, wished for it to be a World government with teeth, writing articles with H. G. Wells urging this.

Dido and Aeneas at the banquet The Vergilius Romanus (Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica, Cod. Vat. lat. 3867), also known as the Roman Vergil, is a 5th-century illustrated manuscript of the works of Virgil. It contains the Aeneid, the Georgics, and some of the Eclogues. It is one of the oldest and most important Vergilian manuscripts. It is 332 by 323 mm with 309 vellum folios. It was written in rustic capitals with 18 lines per page.  Decoration  The Vergilius Romanus is one of the few surviving illustrated classical manuscripts. As such, its importance to art history cannot be overstated. The manuscript has 19 surviving illustrations, painted by at least two artists, both of whom are anonymous. The style of both artists represents the beginning of a break with classical style. The human form becomes abstracted and flattened and the naturalistic depiction of space is abandoned. The first artist painted a single miniature on folio 1 recto, an illustration for the First Eclogue. In it a cowherd, Tityrus, plays a flute while sitting under a tree. The heads of three cows look out from behind the tree. Meanwhile a standing goatherd, Meliboeus, leads a goat by its horns under a tree. More goats look out from behind that tree. This miniature shows some remnants of classical style. The cows and goats looking out from behind the trees are an attempt, albeit an unsuccessful one, at creating the appearance of space. The garments of the two men are draped naturally and the heads are shown in three quarter view. The miniature, unlike any miniature in this manuscript, is unframed which shows a connection to the tradition of papyrus roll illustration. The second artist demonstrates a more radical break from the classical tradition in the remaining miniatures. All of these miniatures are framed in red and gold. The artist seems to have no real understanding of the portrayal of the human body, and is incapable of handling a contorted pose, such as is seen on folio 100 verso, where a reclining figure is portrayed in an utterly unconvincing manner. Faces are no longer portrayed in three quarter position but are either frontal or full profile. The clothing no longer drapes naturally but is instead reduced to rhythmic curving lines. The page is often divided into separate compartments (See, for example, Folio 108r). When a landscape is depicted there is no attempt to depict a three-dimensional space. There is no ground line and items are spread evenly over the field. Care is taken so that items do not overlap each other. The effect is remarkably similar to some Roman floor mosaics, which may have served as inspiration (see folios 44 verso and 45 recto. The second artist was a fine artist. However, his interests were in patterns and lines rather than in the naturalistic portrayal of space and the human form. The manuscript contains three author portraits (Folios 3v, 9r, and 14 r). These portraits show a reliance on the early papyrus scroll tradition of manuscript portraits. They are inserted into the text column within a frame. The portraits show Vergil sitting on a chair between a lectern and a locked chest. The portrait on folio 3v has the lectern on Vergil's right on the chest on his left, which is reversed in the other two portraits.  Provenance  The Vergilius Romanus was produced in an undetermined province. Based on the style of some aspects of the illumination Martin Henig has suggested that it was produced in Britain. If this is true it would make it the oldest surviving British codex. It was at the Abbey of St Denis until the 15th century but it is not known how it came to be at St Denis or in the Vatican. The Vergilius Romanus is not to be confused with the Vergilius Vaticanus (Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica, Cod. Vat. lat. 3225) or the Vergilius Augusteus, other ancient Vergilian manuscripts in the Biblioteca Apostolica.

History Pershing Square in the foreground Early development In 1867, two wealthy developers, Prudent Beaudry, a French-Canadian immigrant, and Stephen Mott purchased a majority of the hill's land. Beaudry's land purchase ranged from present time Hill St. to Olive St. and 4th St. and 2nd St. Mott's land purchase ranged between 4th St. to Temple and Figueroa and Grand. Because of the hill's excellent views of the Los Angeles Basin and the Los Angeles River, he knew that it would make for an opulent subdivision. Beaudry employed surveyor George Hansom to help divide up the land into 80 plots to sell to individual buyers. Beaudry started to build his house on the top of the hill, a modest two-story structure. He needed the infrastructure set up to reach the top of the hill, such as the water pipes. He asked the Los Angeles Water Company to help build the water pipe up the hill. Due to the nature of the hill and their initial concerns about the plan they denied his plea. As result, he built his own pipes and also formed the Canal and Reservoir Company Several new streets were created, one of which - Bunker Hill Avenue (named in commemoration of the Battle of Bunker Hill) - eventually gave its name to the new neighborhood. Beaudry developed the peak of Bunker Hill with lavish two-story Victorian houses that became famous as homes for the upper-class residents of Los Angeles. The dominant architecture of the community of the houses of Bunker Hill was Queen Anne and Eastlake style. The geography of the Hill allowed these residents to escape the hustle and bustle of the city as it slowly grew around at the flatland at the bottom of the hill. Some notable residents during these times are: *Prudent Beaudry - 13th Mayor of Los Angeles, developer of Bunker Hill *L. J. Rose: Arrived from Iowa, due to the death of his son to serious bronchial trouble during a harsh winter. Wine maker and entrepreneur *Dr. Edmund Hildreth: Retired Clergyman from Chicago *D. F. Donigan: Self-made man. Owned his own contracting business, which later was the contractor for the construction of the first railroad which led from Los Angeles to Pasadena. He became an indispensable adviser to Beaudry when it came to beginning the development of Bunker Hill in its early stages. *Colonel Louis W. Bradbury and his wife - Made their fortune from a silver mine in Southern California. Original owner of the Bradbury Building in Downtown LA *Judge Robert M. Widney - Founder of University of Southern California. Helped create the first transportation for the residents up the Hill, a horse-drawn carriage. After the introduction of the horse carriage to the Bunker Hill neighborhood, the iconic Angel's Flight was proposed. Angel's Flight, now dubbed \\"The World's Shortest Railway\\", took residents homeward from the bottom of the 33% grade and down again. Colonel J. W. Eddy petitioned the Los Angeles City Council to establish an electric cable railway, which was approved ten days later signed by the mayor at the time, Meredith P. Snyder. The first railways which was established and operational was on Third St, from Hill st. to Olive st. = \\"Blighted Community\\" = Initially a residential suburb, Bunker Hill retained its exclusive character through the end of World War I. Around the 1920s and the 1930s, with the advent of the Pacific Electric Railway and the construction of the freeway, and the increased urban growth fed by an extensive streetcar system, its wealthy residents began leaving for enclaves such as Beverly Hills and Pasadena. Bunker Hill's houses were increasingly subdivided to accommodate renters. Bunker Hill was at this time \\"Los Angeles's most crowded and urban neighborhood\\".Mike Davis, \\"Hollywood's Dark Shadow,\\" in Dead Cities and Other Tales (New York: The New Press, 2003; orig. ed. 2002), 132. By World War II, the Pasadena Freeway, built to bring shoppers downtown, was taking more residents out. Additional postwar freeway construction left downtown comparatively empty of both people and services. The once-grand Victorian mansions of Bunker Hill became the home of impoverished pensioners.Documentary \\"Bunker Hill\\" special feature on the DVD The Exiles Over time, these tenements became more prominent, and apartment buildings started being built alongside these houses. As more and more people crowded into these cheap housing units, the population of the hill increased 19%, most of whom were low income. As the once extravagant and elaborate Victorian buildings began to fade and deteriorate, there was also an increase in crime. The area became notorious enough to be depicted in the genre of film noir. Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project Wells Fargo Center, One California Plaza and Two California Plaza, today stands on the highest point of Bunker Hill. As seen from the top of the Westin Bonaventure Hotel. In 1955, Los Angeles city planners decided that Bunker Hill required a massive slum clearance project. There were a couple of major political events which led to the \\"removal of the blight\\" and redevelopment of Bunker Hill. The California Community Redevelopment Law of 1945, the Federal Housing Act of 1946 and 1949, the creation of the Community Redevelopment Agency in 1948, and also the Bunker Hill Urban Renewal Project in 1959. The California Community Redevelopment law of 1945 allowed counties and cities to create and implement these agencies to help deal with the redevelopment of local cities. Until 2011, these Agencies held much power and were still around, until Governor Jerry Brown signed into law two bills to dissolve them. Along with those political factors, other things which led to the conclusion of the blighted neighborhood came from some of the government offices. The LAPD called the area a \\"high frequency crime area\\", due to the fact that the area's apartments catered to known offenders. The Health department of Los Angeles also called the area a health hazard for its city. It wasn't until the CRA had won an ongoing court case against the residents of Bunker Hill. This loss for the residents of Bunker Hill led to the displacement of many families and removal of many of the low income residents of the area. This victory for the CRA led to them being able to buy land to redevelop as they saw fit. Within the plans for the redevelopment, there was a section for the rehabilitation of the buildings of Bunker Hill. The section was slated to preserve the historical buildings of Bunker Hill, but instead were demolished since there was no actual rehabilitation planned. The development of Bunker Hill caused much controversy. The creation of the Public Works Administration and the 1949 U.S. Federal Housing Act helped quickly to clear and acquire the land on which \\"slum and blighted\\" areas of Downtown's Bunker Hill were situated. The city cleared the land and sold this land to private and public development according to the plan made by the CRA. The top of Bunker Hill was cleared of its houses and then flattened as the first stage of the Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project to populate Bunker Hill with modern plazas and buildings. When the height limit of buildings for Los Angeles was finally raised (previously buildings were limited to 150 feet), developers built some of the tallest skyscrapers in the region to take advantage of the area's existing dense zoning. In approving such projects, the city sought to project a modern, sophisticated image. John Ferraro Building, Bunker Hill, home to the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power The project is the longest redevelopment project in Los Angeles history. The majority of the skyscrapers on Bunker Hill were built in the 1980s, with a new skyscraper or two being finished nearly every year. However, the momentum died down in the 1990s, shortly after the 52-story Two California Plaza was finished. In 1999, the vacancy rate for downtown commercial skyscrapers was 26%, one of the highest in the nation for that time. Planned office towers were canceled, including California Plaza Three, and the nearby four-towered Metropolis (brought back to life in 2005). 21st century adaptive re-use Aerial view in 2014 Many of the older buildings and the early high-rises surrounding Bunker Hill are undergoing adaptive reuse from commercial to residential. This trend began in 2000, when the Los Angeles City Council passed an adaptive reuse ordinance, allowing old unused office buildings to be redeveloped as apartments or \\"lofts\\". Developers realized there was a high level of pent-up demand for living in or near downtown by artists and employees of various firms in the Financial District and government workers in the Civic Center, and that they could profit by supplying housing to meet such demand. Because of the popularity of the New Urbanism in California, the city has required developers to build mixed-use residential buildings as much as possible. This means that the first floor of such residential developments is devoted to commercial retailers, so that residents do not have to constantly drive around for all their shopping trips and buildings present a more welcoming facade to passersby on the sidewalk. A sign of the success of the downtown renaissance was the lower office vacancy rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 at 16%, compared to 19% for 2003, and 26% for 1999.Vincent, Roger (13 February 2014) \\"With sale of Two California Plaza, Bunker Hill is poised for comeback\\" Los Angeles Times = Affordable housing = While developers are primarily building market-rate housing on Bunker Hill today, the City of Los Angeles has very strict laws, rules, and ordinances established that promote the inclusion of all income levels into the residential mix. Some examples include incentives for the creation of affordable housing (rather than market-rate housing), the preservation of existing affordable housing, the development of affordable housing by the city itself (rather than waiting for private developers), and others. The city has written documentation regarding the development of affordable housing. On the topic of building affordable housing for very low-income to moderate-income, Principal City Planner Jane Blumenfeld said, \\"We are trying to make it attractive to build [downtown] and get this added affordable housing that we normally wouldn't have. We need an adequate amount of lower income housing so that in 20 years Downtown doesn't become an exclusive neighborhood.\\"http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2005/03/28/news/news02.txt downtownnews.com The Emerson apartment building, owned by the Related Companies, has 271 units, of which 216 are leased at market rates. The other 55 units are at subsidized rates to tenants whose annual incomes are less than 50% of the local median, which was $42,700 for a family of four in 2014.Vincent, Roger (October 1, 2014) \\"Developer of new Bunker Hill apartment high-rise woos older residents\\" Los Angeles Times  Notable features = Library Steps  Library Steps, also called Bunker Hill Steps The 60-foot wide double stairway public art installation Library Steps was designed by Lawrence Halprin in 1989.

Angels Flight tramway  The 1902 Angels Flight funicular tramway/railway, originally connecting Hill Street and Olive Street, was rebuilt and relocated in 1996 to connect Hill Street with California Plaza.  Public venues  Walt Disney Concert Hall, Bunker HillContributing to the resurgence of Bunker Hill has been the construction of public venues, such as Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Museum of Contemporary Art. In February 2007, $2.05 billion was approved for the Grand Avenue Project, which over the next 10 years would bring in over 2,000 new residential units, over 400 of them being affordable units for all degrees of low-income families; a million square feet (93,000 m¬≤) of office space; a Mandarin Oriental hotel; 600,000 square feet (56,000 m¬≤) of retail and entertainment space; and the Grand Park, connecting City Hall to Bunker Hill. Office space and residential units will be in several skyscrapers ranging between 35-55 stories each. Nearby planned projects include L.A. Live on Figueroa Street and Olympic Boulevard in South Park (the southern end of the Bunker Hill area). The Broad modern art museum opened next to Disney Concert Hall on September 20, 2015. In popular culture Angels Flight, December 2011 Radio Angels Flight is referenced in The Adventures of Philip Marlowe radio program episode \\"Baton Sinister\\", dated September 17, 1949, in which Marlowe has a rendezvous in Bunker Hill. Film In the 1940s and 1950s, Bunker Hill was a popular film setting, especially in the film noir genre, because of its Victorian homes, its rambling hillside apartments and flophouses, its Angels Flight funicular, and its mean (or at least mean- looking) streets.LA Downtown News Will Angels Flight Ever Roll Again?tumblr. Los Angeles's Bunker Hill: Pulp Fiction's Mean Streets and Film Noir's Ground Zero!

Angels Flight and its Third Street neighborhood, c. 1930s, were re-created in South Africa for the filming of Ask the Dust (2006), based on the novel by John Fante, which was set in the district in the 1930s. Fante also wrote a book called Dreams From Bunker Hill, his last novel, dictated near death to his wife. The 2nd Street Tunnel under Bunker Hill is widely used in film and advertising. Music Bunker Hill is also the title of (and referenced in) the 1992 song from the Free-for-All album by Angeleno transplant Michael Penn and a B-side of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Jim Dawson's 2008 book Angels Flight includes several chapters, complete with many dozens of early photos, on Bunker Hill and its literary and film background.

Dictionary of Environment and Sustainable Development. John Wiley and Sons. 247 p. Abiotic factors include ambient temperature, amount of sunlight, and pH of the water soil in which an organism lives. Biotic factors would include the availability of food organisms and the presence of biological specificity, competitors, predators, and parasites.  Overview  Cancer is mainly the result of environmental factors An organism's genotype (e.g., in the zygote) translated into the adult phenotype through development during an organism's ontogeny, and subject to influences by many environmental effects. In this context, a phenotype (or phenotypic trait) can be viewed as any definable and measurable characteristic of an organism, such as its body mass or skin color. Apart from the true monogenic genetic disorders, environmental factors may determine the development of disease in those genetically predisposed to a particular condition. Stress, physical and mental abuse, diet, exposure to toxins, pathogens, radiation and chemicals found in almost all personal-care products and household cleaners are common environmental factors that determine a large segment of non-hereditary disease. If a disease process is concluded to be the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factor influences, its etiological origin can be referred to as having a multifactorial pattern. Cancer is often related to environmental factors. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, minimizing alcohol and eliminating smoking reduces the risk of developing the disease, according to researchers. Environmental triggers for asthma\\"Asthma and Its Environmental Triggers\\", National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, May 2006, retrieved 5 March 2010 and autism\\"Study showing evidence of a major environmental trigger for autism\\", November 10, 2008 navjot PhysOrg, retrieved 5 March 2010 have been studied too. Exposome The exposome encompasses the set of human environmental (i.e. non-genetic) exposures from conception onwards, complementing the genome. The exposome was first proposed in 2005 by cancer epidemiologist Christopher Paul Wild in an article entitled \\"Complementing the genome with an \\"exposome\\": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology\\". The concept of the exposome and how to assess it has led to lively discussions with varied views in 2010, 2012,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2012). \\"Exposome and Exposomics\\". Retrieved 5 March 2013. and 2014.Porta M, editor. Greenland S, Hern√°n M, dos Santos Silva I, Last JM, associate editors (2014). A dictionary of epidemiology, 6th. edition. New York: Oxford University Press. In his 2005 article, Wild stated, \\"At its most complete, the exposome encompasses life-course environmental exposures (including lifestyle factors), from the prenatal period onwards.\\" The concept was first proposed to draw attention to the need for better and more complete environmental exposure data for causal research, in order to balance the investment in genetics. According to Wild, even incomplete versions of the exposome could be useful to epidemiology. In 2012, Wild outlined methods, including personal sensors, biomarkers, and 'omics' technologies, to better define the exposome. He described three overlapping domains within the exposome: # a general external environment including the urban environment, education, climate factors, social capital, stress, # a specific external environment with specific contaminants, radiation, infections, lifestyle factors (e.g. tobacco, alcohol), diet, physical activity, etc. # an internal environment to include internal biological factors such as metabolic factors, hormones, gut microflora, inflammation, oxidative stress. In late 2013, this definition was explained in greater depth in the first book on the exposome. In 2014, the same author revised the definition to include the body's response with its endogenous metabolic processes which alter the processing of chemicals. Measurement For complex disorders, specific genetic causes appear to account for only 10-30% of the disease incidence, but there has been no standard or systematic way to measure the influence of environmental exposures. Some studies into the interaction of genetic and environmental factors in the incidence of diabetes have demonstrated that \\"environment-wide association studies\\" (EWAS, or exposome-wide association studies) may be feasible. However, it is not clear what data sets are most appropriate to represent the value of \\"E\\". Research initiatives As of 2016, it may not be possible to measure or model the full exposome, but several European projects have started to make first attempts. In 2012, the European Commission awarded two large grants to pursue exposome-related research.The HELIX project at the Barcelona-based Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology was launched around 2014, and aimed to develop an early-life exposome.A second project, Exposomics, based at Imperial College London, launched in 2012, aimed to use smartphones utilising GPS and environmental sensors to assess exposures.About Exposomics EU In late 2013, a major initiative called the \\"Health and Environment-Wide Associations based on Large Scale population Surveys\\" or HEALS, began. Touted as the largest environmental health-related study in Europe, HEALS proposes to adopt a paradigm defined by interactions between DNA sequence, epigenetic DNA modifications, gene expression, and environmental factors. In December 2011, the US National Academy of Sciences hosted a meeting entitled \\"Emerging Technologies for Measuring Individual Exposomes.\\" A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overview, \\"Exposome and Exposomics\\", outlines the three priority areas for researching the occupational exposome as identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has invested in technologies supporting exposome-related research including biosensors, and supports research on gene-environment interactions. Proposed Human Exposome Project (HEP) The idea of a Human Exposome Project, analogous to the Human Genome Project, has been proposed and discussed in numerous scientific meetings, but as of 2017, no such project exists. Given the lack of clarity on how science would go about pursuing such a project, support has been lacking.Arnaud, Celia Henry (16 August 2010). \\"Exposing The Exposome\\".

Related fields The concept of the exposome has contributed to the 2010 proposal of a new paradigm in disease phenotype, \\"the unique disease principle\\": Every individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual, considering uniqueness of the exposome and its unique influence on molecular pathologic processes including alterations in the interactome. This principle was first described in neoplastic diseases as \\"the unique tumor principle\\". Based on this unique disease principle, the interdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) integrates molecular pathology and epidemiology.  Socioeconomic drivers  Global change is driven by many factors; however the five main drivers of global change are: population growth, economic growth, technological advances, attitudes, and institutions.Liverman, D., B. Yarnal, and B. L. Turner Ii. 2003. The Human Dimensions of Global Change. In Geography in America at the Dawn of the 21st Century, eds. G. L. Gaile and C. J. Willmott, 267-282. Oxford: Oxford University Press. These five main drivers of global change can stem from socioeconomic factors which in turn, these can be seen as drivers in their own regard. Socioeconomic drivers of climate change can be triggered by a social or economic demand for resources such as a demand for timber or a demand for agricultural crops. In tropical deforestation for instance, the main driver is economic opportunities that come the extraction of these resources and the conversion of this land to crop or rangelands.Lambin, E. F., B. L. Turner Ii, J. Helmut, S. Agbola, A. Angelsen, J. Bruce, O. Coomes, R. Dirzo, G. Fischer, C. Folke, P. George, K. Homewood, J. Imbernon, R. Leemans, X. Li, E. Moran, M. Mortimore, R. Ramakrishnan, J. Richards, H. Skanes, W. Steffen, G. Stone, U. Svedin, T. Veldkamp, C. Vogel, and J. Xu. 2001. The causes of land-use and land-cover change: moving beyond the myths. Global Environmental Change 11:261-269. These drivers can be manifested at any level, from the global level demand for timber all the way to the household level. An example of how socioeconomic drivers affect climate change can be seen in the soy bean trading between Brazil and China. The trading of soy beans from to Brazil and China has grown immensely in the past few decades. This growth in trade between these two countries is stimulated by socioeconomic drivers. Some of the socioeconomic drivers in play here are the rising demand for Brazilian soy beans in China, the increase in land use change for soy bean production in Brazil, and the importance of strengthening foreign trade between the two countries.Liu, J., V. Hull, M. Batistella, R. DeFries, T. Dietz, F. Fu, T. W. Hertel, R. C. Izaurralde, E. F. Lambin, S. Li, L. A. Martinelli, W. J. McConnell, E. F. Moran, R. Naylor, Z. Ouyang, K. R. Polenske, A. Reenberg, G. de Miranda Rocha, C. S. Simmons, P. H. Verburg, P. M. Vitousek, F. Zhang, and C. Zhu. 2013. Framing Sustainability in a Telecoupled World. Ecology and Society 18 (2). All of these socioeconomic drivers have implications in climate change. For instance, an increase in the development for soy bean croplands in Brazil means there needs to be more and more land made available for this resource. This causes the general land cover of forest to be converted into croplands which in its own regard has an impact on the environment.Turner Ii, B. L., and W. Meyer. 1994. Global Land-Use and Land- Cover Change: An Overview. In Changes in Land Use and Land Cover: A Global Perspective, eds. W. Meyer and B. L. Turner Ii, 3-9. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.This example of land use change driven by a demand of a resource, isn‚Äôt only happening in Brazil with soy bean production. Harvesting crawfish in Acadia Parish, Louisiana. Another example came from The Renewable Energy Directive 2009 Union when they mandated biofuel development for countries within their membership. With an international socioeconomic driver of increasing the production biofuels comes affects in land use in these countries. When agricultural cropland shift to bioenergy cropland the original crop supply decreases while the global market for this crop increases. This causes a cascading socioeconomic driver for the need for more agricultural croplands to support the growing demand. However, with the lack of available land from the crop substitution to biofuels, countries must look into areas further away to develop these original croplands. This causes spillover systems in countries where this new development takes place. For instance, African countries are converting savanna's into cropland and this all stems from the socioeconomic driver of wanting to develop biofuels.Eakin, H., DeFries, R., Kerr, S., Lambin, E. F., Liu, J., Marcotullio, P. J., ... Zimmerer, K. (2014). Significance of telecoupling for exploration of land-use change. In Rethinking Global Land Use in an Urban Era (pp. 141-161). MIT Press. Furthermore, socioeconomic driver that cause land use change don‚Äôt all occur at an international level. These drivers can be experienced all the way down to the household level. Crop substitution doesn't only come from biofuel shifts in agriculture, a big substitution came from Thailand when they switched the production of opium poppy plants to non-narcotic crops. This caused Thailand's agricultural sector to grow, but it caused global rippling effects (opium replacement). For instance, in Wolong China, locals use forests as fuelwood to cook and heat their homes. So, the socioeconomic driver in play here is the local demand for timber to support subsistence in this area. With this driver, locals are depleting their supply for fuelwood so they have to keep moving further away to extract this resource. This movement and demand for timber is in turn contributing to the loss of pandas in this area because their ecosystem is getting destroyed.Liu, J., T. Dietz, S. R. Carpenter, M. Alberti, C. Folke, E. Moran, A. N. Pell, P. Deadman, T. Kratz, J. Lubchenco, E. Ostrom, Z. Ouyang, W. Provencher, C. L. Redman, S. H. Schneider, and W. W. Taylor. 2007. Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems. Science 317 (5844):1513- 1516 However, when researching local trends the focus tends to be on outcomes instead of on how changes in the global drivers affect outcomes.Stockholm Environment Institute. Linking Global and Local Scenarios under Climate Change. Stockholm Environment Institute, 2003, www.jstor.org/stable/resrep00343. Accessed 12 Mar. 2020. With this being said, community level planning needs to be implemented when analyzing socioeconomic drivers of change. In conclusion, one can see how socioeconomic drivers at any level play a role in the consequences of human actions on the environment. These drivers all have cascading effects on land, humans, resources, and the environment as a whole. With this being said, humans need to fully understand how their socioeconomic drivers can change the way we live. For instance, going back to the soy bean example, when the supply can‚Äôt meet the demand for soy beans the global market for this crop increases which then in turn affects countries that rely on this crop for a food source. These affects can cause a higher price for soy beans at their stores and markets or it can cause an overall lack of availability for this crop in importing countries. With both of these outcomes, the household level is being affected by a national level socioeconomic driver of an increased demand for Brazilian soy beans in China. From just this one example alone, one can see how socioeconomic drivers influence changes at a national level that then lead to more global, regional, communal, and household level changes. The main concept to take away from this is the idea that everything is connected and that our roles and choices as humans have major driving forces that impact our world in numerous ways.

The event, which is celebrated annually in the first week of September, commemorates the fall of the monarch and the subsequent accession of his son Ferdinand VII. The revolt was instigated by disgruntled citizens and by Ferdinand's supporters.  Causes of the Tumult  Before the mutiny, Charles IV's valido, or prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, a former member of the Royal Guard, had become unpopular among both the nobles and the Spanish people. The nobility resented how Godoy had attained power even though he was born in poverty and obscurity. Most notable among them was the King's own son Ferdinand, who had led the El Escorial Conspiracy a few months earlier. The people were upset about Godoy's ambitious nature, his flirting with many women of the court and his willingness to have Catholic Spain make treaties with atheist Revolutionary France against Christian (though Anglican) Great Britain. Another important factor was the economic crisis affecting the country, which was heightened after Spain lost its navy in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. This had impaired trade with the American colonies, causing food shortages and affecting industrial production. In addition, under the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, the King and Godoy had allowed French Emperor Napoleon's troops to cross Spain to attack Portugal. This move was extremely unpopular with the Spanish people, who saw the entry as a humiliating invasion, which it soon became. French troops rapidly occupied the important cities of San Sebasti√°n, Pamplona, and Barcelona, fuelling Spanish resentment towards Godoy.  Mutiny  The uprising took place on 17 March 1808 in Aranjuez, about south of Madrid, where the royal family and the government were staying while on their way south, anticipating a French invasion from the north. Soldiers, peasants, and members of the general public assaulted Godoy's quarters and captured him. The mutineers made King Charles dismiss Godoy, and, two days later, the court forced the King himself to abdicate in favor of his son and rival, who became King Ferdinand VII.Stanley G. Payne, History of Spain of Portugal, Vol 2, University of Wisconsin Press., 1973, , page 420  Aftermath  In 1808 Napoleon, under the false pretense of resolving the conflict, invited both Charles IV and Ferdinand VII to Bayonne, France. Both were afraid of the French ruler's power and thought it appropriate to accept the invitation. However, once in Bayonne, Napoleon forced them both to renounce the throne and grant it to himself. The Emperor then named his brother Joseph Bonaparte king of Spain.

Beginning his professional acting career at the age of seven, Patrick is perhaps best known for his role as child werewolf Eddie Munster on the CBS comedy television series The Munsters from 1964 to 1966 and in the 1966 feature film Munster, Go Home!, and as Mark on the ABC Saturday morning series Lidsville from 1971 to 1973. The Munsters cast Life and career Patrick Alan Lilley was born in August 2, 1953,\\"Butch Patrick\\". Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved April 28, 2018. in Inglewood, California. He was spotted by a talent agent at the age of seven, which led to a series of appearances in television commercials and guest appearances on TV shows. In 1961 he made his feature-film debut in the 20th Century Fox comedy‚Äìfantasy The Two Little Bears, in which he co-starred with Eddie Albert and Jane Wyatt. Over the next two years, Patrick went on to appear in guest-starring roles on numerous television series, including Ben Casey, Alcoa Premiere, Bonanza, My Favorite Martian, Mister Ed, and Rawhide and recurring roles on The Real McCoys and General Hospital. These roles would have him appear opposite headliners including Judy Garland, Burt Lancaster, and Sidney Poitier. When recounting how he began his acting career, Patrick explained \\"I owe my career to my sister. She was the one who got me started and gave me all the encouragement. She always wanted to be an actress and was on the casting call sheet one day. She was asked if there were any other children at home. She told them about me, and I got some small roles, then some bigger ones...\\" In 1964, Patrick landed the role of child werewolf Eddie Munster, starring alongside Fred Gwynne as Herman Munster, Yvonne De Carlo as Lily Munster and Al Lewis as Grandpa, on the CBS television series The Munsters, a fantasy situation comedy loosely based on Universal's movie monsters. The role of Eddie was originally portrayed by child actor Happy Derman in the pilot episode before Patrick was ultimately selected out of hundreds of boys for the role. When asked how he landed the role of Eddie, Patrick recalled \\"I had a lot of experience. But maybe it was because my fangs were my own teeth. My teeth were so bad, that even when I closed my mouth they stuck out. I was about a head smaller than the other kids, and they liked that because it played off Herman's height.\\" Living on the East Coast at the time, Patrick commuted to Los Angeles every week during filming of the series, appearing in 70 episodes during The Munsters two-season run from 1964 to 1966. He also responded in an April 2017 interview with ComingSoon.net, when asked if he recalled his TV mother (Yvonne De Carlo) hiding tiny portions of dialogue around the set, attaching them to props to help jog her memory, so the dialogue could be added to her performance: \\"No, not in The Munsters she wasn't doing that. Maybe later in life. Because sometimes your memory starts slipping on you. But that's a great idea, actually! I'll have to remember that!\\" He also was asked if he had ever kept in touch with his on-screen family after The Munsters was canceled, especially De Carlo, who died on January 8, 2007. He replied, \\"No, after the show ended, everyone went their own ways. But in the early '80s, I contacted Al Lewis and we became friends and I started attaching myself to the Munster name and brand. And then 10 years after that I started talking to Yvonne. I was actually a guest on The Vicki Lawrence Show where I was this surprise guest brought out for Yvonne and after that we became friends. I started visiting her and she was somewhat of a recluse, living in North Los Angeles and I introduced her to this guy in Hollywood who would send her care packages, movies to watch and sort of get her back in the loop of Hollywood.\\" After The Munsters ended, Patrick continued to appear in guest-starring roles on various popular television series of the 1960s, including I Dream of Jeannie, Death Valley Days, Gunsmoke, The Monkees, Daniel Boone, and Adam-12, as well as a recurring role as Gordon Dearing on the CBS family comedy series My Three Sons. During this time, Patrick also appeared in several Walt Disney films, including Way Down Cellar, The Young Loner and The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band, as well as portraying the role of Milo in the 1970 MGM live-action/animated film The Phantom Tollbooth. Patrick as Mark with the hats in Lidsville, 1971 In 1971, Patrick landed the starring role on Sid and Marty Krofft's Saturday morning children's program Lidsville, broadcast on ABC. In the psychedelic fantasy series, Patrick portrayed Mark, a boy lost in a strange land of walking, talking, singing hats, opposite veteran character actors Charles Nelson Reilly and Billie Hayes. The show was in production from 1971 to 1973. In 1975, Patrick left acting to work for his father and began to learn to play the bass guitar. In 1983, he recorded the song, \\"Whatever Happened To Eddie?\\" (b/w \\"Little Monsters\\"), with several instrumentalists and backup singers under the group name \\"Eddie and the Monsters.\\" Set to the tune of the Munsters theme, the song details his life as a Munster. (\\"You might wonder why I have a dragon for a pet‚Äîwell, he's just there to keep me company on the set.\\") He recorded a second single, \\"It's Only Halloween\\", which was released on Park Lane Drive Records in 2007. In addition to his music, Patrick returned to occasional film and television work, including making cameo appearances as \\"Himself\\" on episodes of the Fox animated television series The Simpsons and the 2003 comedy film Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, as well as appearing as a grown-up Eddie Munster in a Little Caesars Pizza commercial. In 2002, Patrick co-hosted Macabre Theatre with Natalie Popovich aka \\"Ivonna Cadaver\\". That same year he also appeared in the first episode the E! Network celebrity dating reality television show Star Dates. Patrick made a cameo appearance in the 2005 retro-horror film Frankenstein vs. the Creature from Blood Cove, directed by William Winckler, playing a man who had become a werewolf, speaking a line of dialogue in comical reference to The Munsters. Personal life On July 26, 2010, Patrick rode his motorcycle in Carthage, New York, to benefit the blind community. In May 2011, Patrick announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. In an interview with U.S. celebrity tabloid magazine Star, he said \\"I went 41 years trying to kill myself. And then finally got to the point when I want to live I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. My first thought when I was told this was 'Isn't this a kicker?'

His first name is sometimes spelled Gustav. Biography Born in Katarina Parish () in Stockholm, Sweden, Anjou was the natural son of Carl Gustaf Jungberg and his housekeeper Maria Lovisa Hagberg. After serving a prison term in 1886 for forgery, Anjou changed his name to \\"Gustaf Ludvig Ljungberg\\" and then began using the alias \\"Gustave Anjou\\" (based on the maiden name of his fianc√©, Anna Maria Anjou). Usually he used the alias \\"Gustave Anjou,\\" but occasionally he also used the aliases \\"H. Anjou\\" and \\"M. Anjou.\\" Gustave and Anna Maria married in 1889. After emigrating to the U.S. in 1890, Anjou took up residence on Staten Island (Richmond County, New York) and became a naturalized citizen in 1918. Anjou died on March 2, 1942 at Tottenville, Staten Island, and was buried in Fairview Cemetery (at West New Brighton, Castleton Corners, New York City). He was predeceased by both his Swedish-born wife Anna Maria Anjou (Oct. 21, 1860 ‚Äì July 6, 1922) and by his only child. Genealogical fraud Few if any names in genealogical circles draw the outrage that Anjou enjoys. He presented himself as a professional genealogist, and his services were employed by many East Coast families in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1910, the New York City Directory reported: \\"British-Am Record Soc, 116 Nassau R [Residence] 1116--C. Percy Hurditch, Pres ; Gustave Anjou. Sec.\\", and in 1912, it reported, \\"Am Genealogical Soc., 116 Nassau R 1117 - Gustave Anjou, Sec.\\" Anjou initially earned a reputation for providing copious amounts of research to back up his findings, much to the delight of his clients. For his \\"findings,\\" Anjou‚Äôs services were expensive for the day and he became quite well off. Subsequent scholarly investigation of Anjou's findings revealed flawed research with the intent to defraud.George E. McCracken, \\"Title Unknown,\\" The American Genealogist, July, 1976. In 1991, genealogists Robert Charles Anderson and Gordon L. Remington wrote companion articles in the Genealogical Journal, a publication of the Utah Genealogical Association, elaborating on the nature and extent of the fraud committed by Anjou. Anderson's article We Wuz Robbed, The 'Modus Operandi' of Gustave Anjou described the manner in which Anjou fabricated the genealogies he prepared. Anderson wrote: > A typical Anjou pedigree displays four recognizable features: :1. A dazzling > range of connections between dozens of immigrants to New England; for > example, connections far beyond what may be seen in pedigrees produced by > anyone else. :2.

History Great Nicobar Island was severely affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tsunami with many deaths, and was cut off from all outside contact for more than a day. Geography The island of Sumatra is located to the south of Great Nicobar. The island covers but is sparsely inhabited, with a population of 8067, largely being covered by rainforest and known for its diverse wildlife. Demography The island is home to the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve, Indira Point ‚Äì the southernmost point of India and INS Baaz naval air station near Campbell Bay under the joint-services Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC) of the Indian Armed Forces. It is the southernmost air station of the Indian Armed Forces. The island is home to the Shompen people.  Topography  The island has several rivers, including the Alexandra, Amrit Kaur, Dogmar and Galathea. Virtually all rivers flow in a southern or southwesterly direction, which is indicative of the general slope of the terrain across the island. There are undulating hills throughout the island, with the main range running in a north-south orientation. Mount Thullier, which is part of this range, has the highest elevation of any point in the Nicobars, at 642 m above sea level. Indira Point (6¬∞45‚Äô10‚Ä≥N and 93¬∞49‚Äô36‚Ä≥E) is the southernmost point of the Great Nicobar Island and India itself. Indira Point subsided 4.25 m in the 26 December 2004 tsunami and the lighthouse there was damaged. The lighthouse was subsequently made functional.  Fauna  The majority of the island is designated as the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve‚Äî home to many unique and endemic species of plants and animals including the Nicobar scrubfowl (Megapodius nicobariensis, a megapode bird), the edible-nest swiftlet (Aerodramus fuciphagus), the Nicobar long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis umbrosa), saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), giant leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), Malayan box turtle, Nicobar tree shrew, reticulated python (Python reticulatus) and the giant robber crab (or coconut crab, Birgus latro).  Transportation  There is a 915m airstrip at Campbell Bay/Tenlaa on the East coast. * Seaport: At least one small shipping dock is located in Campbell Bay. Indira Point Indira Point is the name of the southernmost point of Republic of India. It is situated on Great Nicobar Island in the Nicobar Islands, which are located in the eastern Indian Ocean at 6¬∞45‚Äô10‚Ä≥N and 93¬∞49‚Äô36‚Ä≥E. This is not on the Indian mainland, but within the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The name of the point was changed from Pygmalion Point on 18 October 1985 in commemoration of Indira Gandhi. It was formerly known by various names that include Pygmalion Point, Parsons Point, and for a brief period India Point. It is located 540 km and more than a day's sea voyage from Port Blair, the capital city and main port of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is approximately 163 km by sea from Sumatra, Indonesia. Rondo Island, Indonesia's northernmost island in Sabang district of Aceh province of Sumatra, lies south of Indira point. India and Indonesia are planning to collaborate to construct a port at Sabang to protect the channel between Great Nicobar Island and Rondo Island (c. May 2019).India seeks to aid Indonesia in developing port in Aceh, Economic Times, 19 May 2018. Indira Point lighthouse Indira Point has a 35 m high cast iron (with red and white bands) lighthouse with 16 nautical miles range. The lighthouse has (RACON (Code 'G') ii DGPS station) with a 300 mm 4 panel revolving light inside a 2.5 m diameter lantern house (BBT). It is an important landmark on the international shipping lane Colombo-Singapore route via Malacca Strait that passes south of Indira Point. It also has a helipad. 2004 tsunami The tsunami which resulted from the Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004 inundated much of the area. This partly damaged the lighthouse, which subsided 4.25 m. As a result of this subsidence, the coast retreated and the sea moved permanently inland. The lighthouse has since been repaired. The base of the lighthouse was 5 m above sea level when constructed in 1972. After the tsunami, the sea rose and the base was less than a metre above the sea level, showing over 4 meters of sea floor subsidence. It has been observed that the sea is slowly retreating back to its original position and the subsidence has decreased as the ocean floor slowly bounces back partially, a similar drop and rise due to crustal decompression and re compression was observed in the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami on Honshu. Indira point was mostly submerged.

He received his PhD in 1976 with the dissertation A Theory of Legal Argumentation, and he achieved his Habilitation in 1984 with a Theory of Constitutional Rights. He is a professor at the University of Kiel and in 2002 he was appointed to the Academy of Sciences and Humanities at the University of G√∂ttingen. In 2010 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Since 2008 the Universities of Alicante, Buenos Aires, Tucum√°n, Antwerp, National University of San Marcos in Lima, Prague, Coimbra, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Chapec√≥, Rio de Janeiro and Bogot√° awarded him the honorary doctorate degree.  Natural law theory  Alexy's definition of law looks like a mix of Kelsen's normativism (which was an influential version of legal positivism) and Radbruch's legal naturalism (Alexy, 2002), but Alexy's theory of argumentation (Alexy, 1983) puts him very close to legal interpretivism. In The Argument From Injustice, Alexy defends Radbruch's formula that injust or evil laws only lose their legal validity when they deliberately disavow justice and equality. He formulated law's relationship to morality on three theses: * The thesis of incorporation; each legal system contains principles. * The moral thesis; law must be related to a common moral. * The correctness thesis; law must be related to a just moral. At the heart of his theory is the claim to correctness: Law must necessarily claim to be correct, no matter how corrupt, lest it be self-contradictory and fundamentally illogical. As law coerces behaviour and gives individuals decisive reasons for acting, the correctness it claims must also be moral.  Publications  *Theorie der juristischen Argumentation.

Life Willigus was born in the Duchy of Saxony, possibly at Sch√∂ningen, the son of a free peasant. The able and intelligent young man received a good education, and was recommended by Bishop Volkold of Meissen to the service of Emperor Otto the Great. About 971, Willigis was appointed chancellor, an office formerly held by the emperor's brother Archbishop Bruno of Cologne. Until 973 he served Otto throughout the last years of his reign and at the height of his power. In 975 Emperor Otto II made him Archbishop of Mainz and Archchancellor for Germany. Of humble origin, Willigis had to cope with many objections; he immediately had Pope Benedict VII confirm his supremacy as metropolitan bishop. Soon he started to build the great Cathedral of Mainz. Willigis demanded solid learning in his clergy too. He was known as a good and fluent speaker. In March 975 he received the pallium from Pope Benedict VII. In January 976 Willigis probably consecrated the first Bishop of Prague, Thietmar (Dƒõtmar) at Brumath in Alsace, whose diocese was put under his jurisdiction. At the 983 Reichstag of Verona, Otto II vested him with large territories in the Rheingau region, thereby laying the foundations for the Prince-Bishopric of Mainz. Upon the emperor's death, Willigis as Primas Germaniae, on Christmas 983 crowned his three-year-old son Otto III Rex Romanorum at Aachen. After the Dowager Empress Theophanu died in 991, Willigis became guardian of the minor, thus making him, together with Otto's grandmother, Adelaide of Italy, de facto regent of the Empire until Otto III reached his majority in 994. In 996 he was in the retinue of the King on his journey to Italy. Together with Otto III he pushed the election of Pope Gregory V against the resistance of the Roman nobility led by Crescentius the Younger and was present at the consecration and at the synod convened a few days later. In this council Willigis strongly urged the return of Bishop Adalbert of Prague, who, unable to bear the conflicts with the Vr≈°ovci noble family and the ruling P≈ôemyslid dynasty, had left his diocese for a second time, to which, after much correspondence between the Holy See and Willigis, he had once already been forced to return in 993. In 997 Pope Gregory V sent the decrees of a synod at Pavia to Willigis, \\"his vicar\\", for publication. He was on friendly terms with Rome, though the Papacy stood at its nadir. These relations were somewhat disturbed by the dispute of Willigis with Bishop Bernward of Hildesheim about jurisdiction in the house of secular canonesses at Gandersheim Abbey. The immediate monastery established in 852 was originally situated at Brunshausen in the Diocese of Hildesheim, but was transferred to nearby Gandersheim within the territorial limits of the Archdiocese of Mainz. Both bishops claimed jurisdiction, until Pope Sylvester II finally declared in favour of Hildesheim, against Willigis' initial resistance. His prot√©g√© was the scholarly and just Burchard, who was appointed Bishop of Worms by Emperor Otto III in 1000. Upon the Emperor's early death, Archbishop Willigis on 7 June 1002 crowned the Duke of Bavaria Henry IV as King of the Romans at Mainz, after the assassination of his rival Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Willigis presided at the 1007 synod at Frankfurt am Main, where thirty-five bishops signed the bull of Pope John XVIII for the erection of the Diocese of Bamberg. Though Willigis has never been canonized, Roman Catholics celebrate his feast on 23 February, the day of his death in 1011. It has also been alternatively given as 18 April.Francis Mershman, \\"St. Willigis\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume 15 (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912), 4 March 2014, Builder Bishop Willigis with Mainz Wheel, Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493 In his diocese he laboured by building bridges, constructing roads, and fostering commerce. In Mainz he initiated the construction of Cathedral and consecrated it on 29 August 1009, dedicating it in honor of St. Martin of Tours, but on the same day, disastrously, it was destroyed by fire. Willigis immediately gave orders for reconstruction. Willigis greatly helped the restoration of the old collegiate church of St. Victor and built that of St. Stephan. He also built churches at Brunnen in Nassau and Seesbach. He showed great solicitude for the religious, and substantially aided the monasteries of St. Ferrutius at Bleidenstadt, of Disibodenberg, and of Jechaburg in Thuringia. Because the Cathedral had not yet been rebuilt, he was buried in the Church of St Stephan. Works *Officium et miracula Sancti Willigisi, ed. V. I. Guerrier (J.

Multi-memory controllers or memory management controllers (MMC) are different kinds of special chips designed by various video game developers for use in Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) cartridges. These chips extend the capabilities of the original console and make it possible to create NES games with features the original console cannot offer alone. The basic NES hardware supports only 40k of ROM total, up to 32k PRG and 8k CHR, thus only a single tile and sprite table are possible. This limit was rapidly reached within the Famicom's first two years on the market and game developers began requesting a way to expand the console's capabilities. These chips are also known as mappers. List of MMC chips=CNROM *Manufacturer: Nintendo *Games: Gradius, Ghostbusters, Gyruss, Arkanoid CNROM was the earliest banking hardware introduced on the Famicom, appearing in early 1986. It consists of a single 7400 series discrete logic chip. CNROM supports a single fixed PRG bank and up to eight CHR banks for 96k total ROM. Some third party variations supported additional capabilities. Many CNROM games store the game level data in the CHR ROM and blank the screen while reading it. UNROM *Manufacturer: Nintendo *Games: Pro Wrestling, Ikari Warriors, Mega Man, Contra, Castlevania Early NES mappers are composed of 7400 series discrete logic chips. UNROM appeared in late 1986. It supports a single fixed 16k PRG bank, the rest of the PRG being switchable.UxROM from NESdevWiki Retrieved on 2009-11-21. Instead of a dedicated ROM chip to hold graphics data (called CHR by Nintendo), games using UNROM store graphics data on the program ROM and copy it to a RAM on the cartridge at run time. MMC1 A Tetris cartridge showing an MMC1B1 chip. *Manufacturer: Nintendo *Games: The Legend of Zelda, Mega Man 2, Metroid, Godzilla: Monster of Monsters, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and more. The MMC1 is Nintendo's first custom MMC integrated circuit to incorporate support for saved games and multi-directional scrolling configurations. The chip comes in at least five different versions: MMC1A, MMC1B1, MMC1B2, MMC1B3 and MMC1C. The differences between the different versions are slight, mostly owing to savegame memory protection behavior. The MMC1 chip allows for switching of different memory banks. Program ROM can be selected in 16KB or 32KB chunks, and character ROM can be selected in 4KB or 8KB chunks. An unusual feature of this memory controller is that its input is serial, rather than parallel, so 5 sequential writes (with bit shifting) are needed to send a command to the circuit.MMC1 from NESdevWiki Retrieved on 2009-11-21. MMC2 *Manufacturer: Nintendo *Games: Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! The MMC2 is only used in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! and the later rerelease which replaced Mike Tyson. A single 8KB bank of program ROM can be selected (with the remaining 24KB locked) and character ROM can be selected in two pairs of 4KB banks, which would be automatically switched when the video hardware attempts to load particular graphic tiles from memory, thus allowing a larger amount of graphics to be used on the screen without the need for the game itself to manually switch them.Nintendo MMC2 from NESdevWiki MMC3 PCB containing Super Mario Bros. 3 and others. *Manufacturer: Nintendo *Games: Mega Man 3, 4, 5, 6, Super Mario Bros. 2NA/EU, Super Mario Bros. 3, Kirby's Adventure, and more. The MMC3 was introduced in 1988. It adds an IRQ timer to allow split screen scrolling without the sacrifice of sprite 0, along with two selectable 8KB program ROM banks and two 2KB+four 1KB selectable character ROM banks, which allows easy instant swapping of sprite and tile data. 8k of save game RAM is supported.Nintendo MMC3 from NESdevWiki MMC4 *Manufacturer: Nintendo *Games: Fire Emblem, Fire Emblem Gaiden, and Famicom Wars This chip is only used in three games, all of which were released only for the Famicom in Japan, and were developed by Intelligent Systems. Functionally, it is nearly identical to the MMC2, with the only difference being that the MMC4 switches program ROM in 16KB banks instead of 8KB banks and has support for a battery-backed SRAM to save game data.Nintendo MMC4 from NESdevWiki MMC5 *Manufacturer: Nintendo *Games: Castlevania III: Dracula's CurseNA/EU, Just Breed, Metal Slader Glory, Laser Invasion, Uchuu Keibitai SDF, Nobunaga's Ambition II, Nobunaga no Yabou - Sengoku Gunyuu Den, Bandit Kings of Ancient China, Romance of the Three Kingdoms II, Uncharted Waters, Genghis Khan II: Clan of the Gray Wolf, Gemfire, L'Empereur, Ishin no Arashi, Shin 4 Nin Uchi Mahjong - Yakuman Tengoku The MMC5 is Nintendo's most advanced MMC. It was originally also the most expensive. Only Koei used this chip regularly. It is similar to Konami's VRC6, but interrupt handling works differently. The chip has 1KB of extra RAM, two extra square wave sound channels, one extra PCM sound channel, support for vertical split screen scrolling, improved graphics capabilities (making 16,384 different tiles available per screen rather than only 256, and allowing each individual 8x8-pixel background tile to have its own color assignment instead of being restricted to one color set per 2x2 tile group), highly configurable program ROM and character ROM bank switching, and a scanline-based IRQ counter.

The chip also contains support for three extra sound channels (two square waves of eight duty cycles each, and one sawtooth wave). It is used in Akumaj≈ç Densetsu (the Japanese version of Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse), while the Western version uses the MMC5 from Nintendo. Since the Nintendo Entertainment System does not allow cartridges to add additional sound channels, the Famicom version's soundtrack was reworked to follow those specifications; thus, the soundtrack on the Western version is implemented by the five sound channels built into the stock NES. VRC7 The VRC7 with a post-processor for the FM synthesis *Manufacturer: Konami, Yamaha *Games: Lagrange Point, Tiny Toon Adventures 2: Trouble in Wackyland The VRC7 is an advanced MMC chip from Konami, supporting bank switching and IRQ counting equivalent to the VRC6, and containing a YM2413 derivative providing 6 channels of FM Synthesis audio. This advanced audio is used only in the Famicom game Lagrange Point; while the Japanese version of Tiny Toon Adventures 2 also uses the VRC7, it does not make use of the extended audio.Konami VRC7 from NESdevWiki Namco 163 *Manufacturer: Namco *Games: Erika to Satoru no Yume B≈çken, Final Lap, King of Kings, Mappy Kids, Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II, Namco Classic II, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Romance of the Three Kingdoms II, Yokai Dochuki, Rolling ThunderJP, Top Striker The 163 has been only used in games exclusive to Japan. Its capabilities were a little better than Nintendo's MMC3. A variant contained extra sound hardware that plays 4-bit wave samples. It supports 1 to 8 extra sound channels, but audible aliasing appears when a sufficiently large number of channels are enabled. FME-7 *Manufacturer: Sunsoft *Games: Batman: Return of the Joker, Hebereke, Gimmick!, and more. The FME-7 is a memory mapping circuit developed by Sunsoft for use in NES and Famicom cartridges. It switches program ROM in 8KB banks and switches the character ROM 1KB banks. It also contains hardware to generate IRQ signals after a specified number of CPU clock cycles, thus achieving split-screen effects with minimal use of processing power. A special version of this MMC, labeled as \\"SUNSOFT 5B\\" rather than \\"FME-7\\", contains a version of the widely used Yamaha YM2149. This sound generation hardware is used on only one Famicom game: Gimmick!. SUNSOFT-4 SUNSOFT-4 *Manufacturer: Sunsoft Unlicensed MMCs Some individual (homebrew) and unlicensed developers have made custom MMCs for the NES, most of which simply expand the available memory. 228 *Manufacturer: Active Enterprises *Games: Action 52, Cheetahmen II 228 is a simple bank switching MMC developed for use in the games Action 52 and Cheetahmen II. It does not have a nametable control bit. In the Action 52 multicart, it also contains a small 16-bit register area that contains the old menu selection when exiting a game. GTROM *Manufacturer: Membler Industries GTROM or Cheapocadabra is a self-flashable MMC developed in 2015 for the homebrew market. The board contains 512K of PRG ROM, 16K of CHR ROM, and two LEDs. While the GTROM does not contain PRG RAM, saved games are possible due to PRG ROM being flashable by NES software.

For almost five years, Rajinikanth's Padayappa (1999), which collected a then record over 30 crore, was regarded as the benchmark for the Tamil film industry with regards to box-office numbers. Ghilli also set the record for becoming the highest grossing non-Malayalam film in Kerala at the time, and it reportedly performed greater than mainstream Malayalam movies in the state.

Ramachandran's Adimai Penn (1969) record for the most people seeing a movie in the first week of its release.

Following the success of Atlee's Theri, he and Vijay were signed by Sri Thenandal Films for another project together in September 2016. Vijay learnt a few magic tricks in preparation for his role as a magician, learning from the magicians, Gogo Requiem from Macedonia, Raman Sharma from Canada, and Dani Belev from Bulgaria.

Despite the success of Mersal, several notions expressed in the film were opposed by various organisations: the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ruling political party of Government of India, and the then-ruling AIADMK had objected to scenes in which the protagonist, played by Vijay, criticises the recently introduced Goods and Services Tax, and also a scene in which a character ridicules Digital India, an initiative promoted by the BJP. The party demanded that those scenes be cut from the film for future viewership, but this was seen as an attack on freedom of expression by opposing political parties and various other celebrities working in Tamil cinema. In addition, several medical associations, such as the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors' Association, condemned the film for the alleged cynical portrayal of doctors working in government-operated hospitals. Doctors working with the Indian Medical Association shared links of the film on pirated websites online, in the hope that it would cause monetary losses to the makers of the film.left Following the successful ventures, Thuppakki and Kaththi, Murugadoss was confirmed to be the director of the 62nd film of Vijay's career. Revealed as Sarkar, a political film, Suresh played the female lead role, marking her second collaboration with Vijay after Bairavaa. Following its release on Diwali 2018, the Government of Tamil Nadu accused the film-makers of Sarkar and Vijay of inciting the people by targeting the government in some scenes, as well as defaming former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa by naming the main antagonist (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar) with her alleged original name Komalavalli. This led to numerous protests by AIADMK cadre at theatres where the film was screened and vandalism of Vijay banners. AIADMK accused the Sun Pictures, which is owned by the film's producer Kalanithi Maran‚Äîwho is the grand nephew of the late former Chief Minister Karunanidhi of DMK‚Äîof targeting the government. Several actors, including veterans Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, supported the filmmakers by citing oppression of freedom of speech. Due to threat of lawsuits from the government, the filmmakers accepted to cut the controversial scenes and mute references of Komalavalli in the audio track. Sarkar broke several collection records and entered the 100 Crore Club within just two days. As a result of the film's success and media attention, the Election Commission of India created awareness regarding Section 49P of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 that allows a voter to have the right to get back his/her ballot back and vote if someone else voted in that individual's name.

He also produced many highly finished drawings of single nude male figures. His paintings combine elements of eroticism and social critique in a style often called magic realism. Early life and education Paul Cadmus was born on December 17, 1904, in a tenement on 103rd Street near Amsterdam Avenue, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the son of artists, Maria Latasa, of Basque and Cuban ancestry, and Egbert Cadmus (1868‚Äì1939), of Dutch ancestry. His father, who studied with Robert Henri, worked as a commercial artist, and his mother illustrated children's books. His sister, Fidelma Cadmus, married Lincoln Kirstein, a philanthropist, arts patron, and co-founder of the New York City Ballet, in 1941. At age 15, Cadmus left school to attend the National Academy of Design for 6 years. He then enrolled at the Art Students League of New York in 1928 taking life-drawing lessons while working as a commercial illustrator at a New York advertising agency. He furthered his education while traveling through Europe from 1931 to 1933 with fellow artist Jared French, who became his lover for a time. Career After traveling through France and Spain, Cadmus and French settled in a fishing village on the island Majorca. In 1933, they headed back to the United States after running out of money, where Cadmus was one of the first artists to be employed by The New Deal art programs, painting murals at post offices. He maintained a studio at 54 Morton Street. Cadmus worked in commercial illustration as well, but French, also a tempera artist, convinced him to devote himself completely to fine art. In 1979, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an associate member and became a full member in 1980. Cadmus is ranked by Artists Trade Union of Russia amongst the world's best artists of the last four centuries. Controversies The Fleet's In!, 1934 (cropped view)In 1934, at the age of 29, he painted The Fleet's In! while working for the Public Works of Art Project of the WPA. This painting, which featured carousing sailors and women, included a stereotypical homosexual solicitation and erotic exaggeration of clinging pants seats and bulging crotches. It was the subject of a public outcry led by Admiral Hugh Rodman, who protested to Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson, saying, \\"It represents a most disgraceful, sordid, disreputable, drunken brawl.\\" Secretary Swanson stated that the painting was \\"right artistic\\" but \\"not true to the Navy.\\" The painting was removed from exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery by Henry L. Roosevelt, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy at the time, and kept in his home until Roosevelt's death in 1936. The publicity helped to launch Cadmus‚Äôs career, and he stated at the time, \\"I had no intention of offending the Navy. Sailors are no worse than anybody else. In my picture I merely commented on them ‚Äì I didn't criticize.\\" The painting, which after Roosevelt's death hung over a mantel at the Alibi Club in Washington for more than half a century, was kept from public view until 1981, temporarily displayed at the Wolfsonian Museum in Miami, and eventually found a home at the Naval Historical Center. In 1938, his painting Pocahantas Saving the Life of John Smith, a mural painted for the Parcel Post Building in Richmond, Virginia, had to be retouched when some observers noticed a fox pelt suggestively hanging between the legs of an Indian depicted in the painting. Cadmus used his then lover, Jared French, as the model for John Smith in the mural. In 1940, two paintings, Sailors and Floozies (1938) and Seeing the New Year In, were removed from public view because the Navy \\"didn't like it\\" and there was \\"too much smell about it.\\" The paintings were being exhibited at the Golden Gate International Exposition and were removed, while a third, Venus and Adonis, remained. The office of Commissioner George Creel was told by the Navy that the painting, Sailors and Floozies, was \\"unnecessarily dirty.\\" Artistic style Cadmus, considered to be a master draftsman, was interested in the Italian Renaissance artists, particularly Signorelli and Mantegna, the so- called \\"masters of muscle.\\" He was also influenced by Reginald Marsh, an American scene painter. Cadmus combined the elements of Signorelli and Mantegna along with Marsh to depict the street life of New York City. He was transfixed by the human body, both the ideal and the repulsive. His ideal was a stylized erotic version of the male body. He found the grotesque everywhere from Greenwich Village cafes, subway stations, the beach at Coney Island to American tourists in an Italian piazza. His art is a form of satire and caricature of his subjects that has been compared to fellow artists George Grosz and Otto Dix. Art critics have been divided on Cadmus' art, with Dore Ashton stating that \\"he's not a historical figure at all, he's an also-ran.\\" Ashton described his paintings as \\"skewed Saturday Evening Post.\\" In 1990, Michael Kimmelman wrote that Cadmus' art served \\"as a reminder that, contrary to the standard view, realism was still a vital tradition in American art during the middle of this century, one that drew from many of the same sources that inspired the Abstract Expressionists who were widely thought to have rendered realism obsolete.\\" Personal life From 1937 until 1945, Cadmus, his lover, Jared French, and French's wife, Margaret Hoening, summered on Fire Island and formed a photographic collective called PaJaMa (\\"Paul, Jared, and Margaret\\"). In between Provincetown, Truro, Fire Island, and New York, they staged various black-and-white photographs of themselves with their friends, both nude and clothed. Most of these friends featured in the photographs were among New York's young artists, dancers and writers, and most were handsome and gay. In 1938, Cadmus and French posed for a series of photographs with the noted photographer George Platt Lynes (1907‚Äì1955). These photographs were not published or exhibited while Lynes was living and show the intimacy and relationship of the two. In the photographs, 14 of which survive today, Cadmus and French vacillate between exposure and concealment, with French generally being the more exhibitionist of the two. Later in the 1940s, Cadmus and his then lover, George Tooker, formed a complicated relationship with French and his wife. When the Frenches bought a home in Hartland, Vermont, they gave Cadmus a house of his own on the property, which French later took back and gave to his Italian lover. In 1965, Cadmus met and began a relationship with Jon (Farquhar) Anderson (July 30, 1937, New Haven, Connecticut - October 21, 2018, Weston, Connecticut), a former cabaret star, in Nantucket that lasted until Cadmus' death in 1999. From the beginning of their 35-year relationship, the then 27-year-old Anderson was Cadmus' model and muse in many of his works. Cadmus was also close friends with many illustrious artists, authors, and dancers including: Christopher Isherwood, W. H. Auden, George Balanchine, George Platt Lynes, George Tooker, Lincoln Kirstein (his brother-in-law), and E. M. Forster, who was said to have read his novel Maurice aloud while Cadmus painted his portrait, which was printed in 1200 copies of a pamphlet The New Disorder in 1949. In 1999, he died at his home in Weston, Connecticut, due to advanced age, five days before his 95th birthday. List of works From 1931 until 1992, Cadmus produced 120 paintings, two a year on average.

In 1957, Fortune Magazine listed Dillon as one of the richest men in the United States, with a fortune then estimated to be from $150 to $200 million. Early life Clarence Dillon was born Clarence Lapowski. His parents were Bertha Stenbock (1862‚Äì1951) and Samuel Lapowski (1848‚Äì1912), who emigrated to the United States. Dillon's father was a Polish Jewish immigrant, likely born at ≈Åom≈ºa, Poland, in 1848. His paternal grandparents were Joshua Lapowski and Paulina Dylion, the daughter of Michel Dylion, a Frenchman.https://www.jta.org/1927/06/12/archive/the-j-d-b-news-letter-2 In 1878, his father went to San Antonio, Texas, and married Bertha Stenbock one year later. Stenbock was born 1862 in Denver, Colorado, the daughter of Gustav Stenbock, a Swedish immigrant, who was prospecting for lead and silver in the Colorado Western Slope. In 1884, the family moved to Abilene, Texas. They became naturalized citizens in the Abilene District Court, on September 25, 1891, legally changing the family name to Dillon on September 17, 1901.Katharyn Duff, Abilene ... On Catclaw Creek (1969), p. 133 Clarence's father died in San Francisco, California, on June 23, 1912, and his mother died in New York City, on January 1, 1951.https://www.jta.org/1928/02/24/archive/lapowski-war-veteran-dies-in-el- paso-buried-with-military-honors Dillon graduated from Worcester Academy, located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and one of the country's oldest day- boarding schools, and then Harvard University in 1905. Career Dillon, Read & Co. Logo In 1912, Dillon met William A. Read, founder of the Wall Street bond broker firm William A. Read & Company through an introduction by his Harvard classmate, William A. Phillips. Dillon joined Read's Chicago office in that year, later moving to the firm's New York office in 1914. Following Read's death in 1916, Dillon bought a majority interest in the firm and was chosen to head the company. In 1921, the company's name was changed to Dillon, Read & Co. In 1921, Dillon focused on the beleaguered Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company which was in receivership. He succeeded in crafting a settlement with Goodyear's bankers, creditors, and stockholders as was raising more than $100 million in funding in an extremely difficult credit market. In 1925, only four years later, Dillon bought the Dodge Brothers Company for $146 million in cash which was the largest such transaction in industrial history at the time. After the acquisition of Dodge, Dillon merged the company with the Chrysler Corporation in 1927 resulting in Chrysler's becoming one of the Big three in the automobile industry. A number of Dillon, Read & Co. partners served in senior roles in government, including Dillon and his right-hand man, James Forrestal, who served as Secretary of the Navy, and later, Secretary of Defense. During World War I, Bernard Baruch, Chairman of the War Industries Board, (known as the Czar of American Industry) asked Dillon to be Assistant Chairman of the War Industries Board. Hobbies Dillon was a Francophile both because he had French origins and for his own personal tastes. In 1929, he purchased an apartment in Paris where he stayed a part of each year until he was well into his 80s. An oenophile as well. Dillon negotiated for months to purchase Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion from Bordeaux businessman Andr√© Gibert who had controlled the French wine producer since 1923. Dillon ultimately made the acquisition on May 13, 1935, for 2,300,000 francs. Dillon made Seymour Weller, who was the son of his wife's sister, president of the new company, Soci√©t√© Vinicole de la Gironde, (later Domaine Clarence Dillon). Weller retired as President of the company in 1975. Dillon is said to have purchased Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion because it was his favorite wine. However Haut-Brion is also near Bordeaux, and good riding and hunting land surrounds the estate. Clarence purchased show dog Fontclair Festoon from Dody Jenkins. This dog would go on to win best-in-show at the Westminster Kennel Club in 1959. The dog was handled by Anne Rogers Clark. Personal life Manhattan townhouse, built 1930 On February 4, 1908, Dillon married Anne McEldin Douglass (1881‚Äì1961) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Anne was the daughter of George Douglass and his wife and second cousin Susan Virginia Dun.For her ancestry, see Harry Wright Newman, A Branch of the Douglas family with its Maryland & Virginia connections (New York: Doubleday, 1967). Together, Clarence and Anne were the parents of a son and daughter: * Clarence Douglass Dillon (1909‚Äì2003), who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from 1961‚Äì65 and the U.S. Ambassador to France. He married Phyllis Chess Ellsworth in 1931. After her death in 1982, he married Susan Sage in 1983. They remained married until his death in 2003. * Dorothy Anne Dillon (1913‚Äì2005), who married Philip Elsworth Allen in 1934. After their divorce, she married Dr. Sydney Shepherd Spivack (1907‚Äì1969), a sociologist, in 1965. After his death in 1969, she married Eric Eweson in 1976, who died in 1988.

Fox fought from 1928 to 1950. Fox claimed he got his start in boxing when he was picked up, while hitchhiking in Georgia, by boxer Young Stribling. At that time, Stribling was travelling from town to town and engaging in boxing matches, basically meeting all comers. Stribling offered Fox a job as a sparring partner. Although he had no experience, Fox, out of work and hungry, accepted the offer. His first sparring session with Stribling almost ended his boxing career. Stribling toyed with him, and eventually knocked him senseless with a right hand to the jaw. Fox claimed he didn't sleep that night, re- living the events of the day, and studying how to avoid a similar fate the next day. Fox concluded that if he stepped forward when Stribling threw his right, he would be inside the punch and in position to hit Stribling with his left. The next day, the two sparred again. This time when Stribling threw his right, Fox was waiting and executed his manoeuvre to perfection. Surprised by Fox's left hook, Stribling's knees buckled. Fox then jumped in and hit him with another left hook, which sent Stribling to the canvas. Although he was fired on the spot, Fox thought that if he could knock Stribling down, he could hold his own with anyone. Fox then made his way to Indianopolis, where he hung around a boxing gym until he was offered a fight. Fox accepted and was on his way. He relocated in Terre Haute, Indiana to train under bantamweight champion Bud Taylor and became the \\"Indiana colored heavyweight champion.\\" He fought frequently for the next nine years without losing a bout. His first loss was by a split decision to light heavyweight champion Maxie Rosenbloom. Fox claimed he engaged in over 300 fights, but many were not recorded. He claimed that he never fought a preliminary bout in his career, just main events. Fox was defeated by Melio Bettina in his only crack at the light heavyweight championship, NYSAC version. In this elimination bout to name a champion, Fox was stopped in the 9th round. Two months before the fight he was stabbed near the heart in a Harlem hotel in a dispute over a woman. Fox also fought and knocked out in two rounds former light-heavyweight champion Bob Olin, and he knocked out Lou Brouillard in seven. He was kayoed in three rounds by future lightheavyweight champion John Henry Lewis. Two of Fox's more surprising victories came against future heavyweight champion Jersey Joe Walcott. On May 12, 1937, Fox knocked out Walcott in the 8th round. In the following year Fox again defeated Walcott, this time by a ten-round decision. Fox is second on the all-time list for first-round knockouts, and was named to the Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

(OCoLC) 3787223 Karl Kalman Targownik (June 17, 1915 ‚Äì January 2, 1996) was a psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor. Dr. Karl Targownik was born in Budapest, Hungary. His parents were Polish Jews who fled to Hungary to escape the Russian invasion during World War I. Soon after the War was over they returned to Poland and settled in the small village of Bochnia, located in the Southwest of Poland near Krak√≥w. While studying in Poland to become a medical doctor, Targownik was captured and sent to a concentration camp. For a period of time, Targownik was a prisoner at the infamous Auschwitz camp. At 29 years old and a mere 80 pounds (36 kg), Targownik was liberated on April 29, 1945 from the Dachau camp. Soon after liberation, Targownik obtained his medical degree and practiced in New York City. In 1952, Targownik moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work at the Menninger Clinic, a popular treatment center for the mentally ill. He developed a friendship with Karl Menninger, and soon rose through the ranks to become one of the institution's top psychiatrists. Targownik frequently spoke to groups about his Holocaust experience, and gained recognition throughout the state of Kansas and much of the Midwest. He was named Kansan of the Year in 1976 by the newspaper of Topeka, Kansas. Dr. Targownik worked and led the Kansas Reception & Diagnostic Center, a State Prison outside of Topeka. It was one of the few remaining institutions for new, incoming state prisoners, where they could be evaluated medically, psychologically and educationally. A team of clinicians would then recommend the level of placement in the state prison system. This Reception & Diagnostic concept followed from Dr. Karl Menninger's philosophy of criminal rehabilitation, as written about in his book, \\"The Crime of Punishment\\" Targownik continued to speak and give interviews through the end of his life, which was complicated by Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

It differs from the other wines on the list in its geographic location in the north of the wine-growing region of Graves. Of the five first growths, it is the only wine with the Pessac-L√©ognan appellation and is in some sense the ancestor of a classification that remains the benchmark to this day. In addition to the grand vin (LWIN 1011247), Haut-Brion produces a red second wine. Formerly named Ch√¢teau Bahans Haut-Brion, beginning with the 2007 vintage, it was renamed Le Clarence de Haut Brion (LWIN 1008153). The vineyard also produces a dry white wine named Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion Blanc (LWIN 1017092), with a limited release of the second dry white wine, Les Plantiers du Haut- Brion, renamed La Clart√© de Haut-Brion for the 2008 vintage. History Although grapes are thought to have been grown on the property since Roman times, the earliest document indicating cultivation of a parcel of land dates from 1423. The property was bought by Jean de S√©gur in 1509, and in 1525 was owned by Admiral Philippe de Chabot. The estate Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion dates back to April 1525 when Jean de Pontac married Jeanne de Bellon, the daughter of the mayor of Libourne and seigneur of Hault-Brion, who brought to him in her dowry the land. In 1533 bought the title to the domain of Haut-Brion, while construction of the ch√¢teau was begun in 1549. 1649, Lord Arnaud III de Pontac became owner of Haut-Brion, and the wine's growing popularity began in earnest. The first records of Haut-Brion wine found in the wine cellar ledger of the English King Charles II in 1660. During the years 1660 and 1661, 169 bottles of the \\"wine of Hobriono\\" were served at the king's court. Charles Ludington states: \\"The re-establishment of a royal court and of court culture generally required an increase in luxury goods. This demand inspired Pontac to launch the prototype of top-growth claret in London. The wine was called Haut- Brion, after the name of the estate from which it came.\\" Samuel Pepys wrote in The Diarist, having tasted the wine at Royal Oak Tavern on April 10, 1663, to have \\"drank a sort of French wine called Ho Bryen that hath a good and most particular taste I never met with\\".winepros.com.au. Pepys provided what Prof. Ludington called \\"the first tasting note of Haut-Brion\\". Therefore both Charles II's cellar book and Pepys' note \\"provide the first mention in any language of estate-named claret and are among the many proofs that Haut-Brion was created specifically for the English market.\\" Pontac went even further in developing the renown of his wine: \\"By improving and \\"branding\\" a product, [...] he created and named a wine that came from a small, circumscribed area of land for the purpose of enhancing its value in the minds and on the palates of discerning English customers.\\" The original diary of Pepys is held in the Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge while the 1660 Cellar Book of King Charles II is held by the British National Archives. In April 2013, the Magdalene College, Cambridge, displayed the Pepys Diary opened at the page of the Haut-Brion mention for the 350th Anniversary of this historical mention. Dr Jane Hughes lectured on Pepys and wine before the gala dinner hosted by the Cambridge University Wine Society and featuring tributes to Pepys. Prince Robert of Luxembourg then challenged wine historians and amateurs to find a new reference to Haut-Brion in history prior to 1660. In 1666, after \\"The Great Fire\\", the son Fran√ßois-Auguste, opened a tavern in London called \\"L'Enseigne de Pontac\\", or the \\"Sign of Pontac's Head\\", which was according to Andr√© Simon, London's first fashionable eating-house. Jonathan Swift \\"found the wine dear at seven shillings a flagon\\". By the end of the 17th century the estate amounted to of which some were under vine. The wine was often sold under the name Pontac, though since the Pontac family owned numerous wine estates that could use the name, it is often impossible to tell when a wine came from Haut-Brion. Sometimes also spelled Pontack, another Pontac estate at Blanquefort which produced white wine would also often go by this name. English philosopher John Locke, visiting Bordeaux in 1677, spoke of Haut- Brion, \\"...The wine of Pontac, so revered in England, is made on a little rise of ground, lieing[sic] open most to the west. It is noe thing but pure white sand, mixed with a little gravel. One would imagin it scarce fit to beare anything..\\" On the cause of its increasing costliness, he stated, \\"thanks to the rich English who sent orders that it was to be got for them at any price\\". The German philosopher Hegel was also enchanted with the wine of Pontac, though it is unknown if his orders were for other de Pontac wines of Saint- Est√®phe. With the death of Fran√ßois-Auguste de Pontac, Fran√ßois-Joseph de Fumel, a nephew by marriage, inherited two-thirds of Haut-Brion with a third coming to Louis-Arnaud Le Comte, Lord Captal of Latresne. The de Fumel family also at one point owned Ch√¢teau Margaux. In 1787, Thomas Jefferson, then American minister to France, came to Bordeaux. On May 25 he visited to Haut- Brion, describing the terroir, \\"The soil of Haut-Brion, which I examined in great detail, is made up of sand, in which there is near as much round gravel or small stone and a very little loam like the soils of the M√©doc\\". His notes placed Haut-Brion among the four estates of first quality, with the entry, \\"3. Haut-Brion, two-thirds of which belong to the Count de Fumel who sold the harvest to a merchant called Barton. The other third belongs to the Count of Toulouse; in all, the ch√¢teau produces 75 barrels.\\" Haut-Brion became the first recorded first growth wine to be imported to the United States, when Jefferson purchased six cases during the travels and had them sent back to his estate in Virginia., as stated in his letter to his brother-in-law Francis Eppes on May 26, 1787: \\"(...) I cannot deny myself the pleasure of asking you to participate of a parcel of wine I have been chusing for myself. I do it the rather as it will furnish you a specimen of what is the very best Bourdeaux wine. It is of the vineyard of Obrion, one of the four established as the very best, and it is of the vintage of 1784 (...).\\" As a consequence of the French Revolution, in July 1794 Joseph de Fumel was guillotined, and his holdings were divided. Posthumously, de Fumel's nephews obtained a pardon for him as well as the restitution of the confiscated property, but they left France. In 1801, they sold Haut-Brion to Talleyrand, Prince of Benevento, owner of Haut- Brion for three years. A less prosperous period followed between 1804 and 1836 under successive ownership of various businessmen, until Joseph-Eug√®ne Larrieu bought Haut-Brion when it was sold by auction. In 1841, by buying the Chai- Neuf building from the Marquis de Catellan, he brought the estate back to the former size of the estate up until the death of Fran√ßois-Auguste de Pontac in 1694. Larrieu's family owned Haut-Brion until 1923. In the classifications of 1855 ahead of the International Exhibition in Paris, Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion was classified Premier Grand Cru, as the only estate from Graves among the three established First Growths of the M√©doc. The prices of Haut-Brion in the 19th century were consistently higher than those of any other Bordeaux wine. This trend has continued into the present day, with the price of the estate's grand vin averaging $571. Modern history Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion presentation card dated 1931, demonstrating the designs of the early 20th century, the label, cork, case and capsule markings. After a series of unsuccessful owners during difficult times, the American banker Clarence Dillon bought Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion on May 13, 1935 for ‚Ç£2,300,000. Several unverified anecdotes surround the acquisition, as Dillon was believed to also consider buying ch√¢teaux Cheval Blanc, Ausone or a majority share in Margaux, but didn't care to make the trip on a rainy, chilly day, and chose Haut-Brion for its proximity to Bordeaux and riding facilities. One account claims Dillon never got out of the car. Dillon made his nephew Seymour Weller president of the new company \\"Soci√©t√© Vinicole de la Gironde\\" (later Domaine Clarence Dillon S.A.S.), who held the position for five decades. Weller restored the park, cleaned the chais, and installed electricity along with new vinification equipment. He retained Georges Delmas, the r√©gisseur and director of Haut-Brion since 1921, and former manager of Cos d'Estournel. Haut-Brion first began using its distinctive bottle, emulating designs of old decanter models, from the 1958 vintage which was released in 1960. Georges Delmas retired in 1961, and was succeeded by his son Jean- Bernard Delmas, born at the estate, instigating a number of renovations. In the 1960s, Haut-Brion was the first of the great growths to innovate with new stainless steel fermentation vats. Clonal selection research was begun in 1972, in collaboration with INRA and the Chambre d'Agriculture. Insisting that great wine cannot be made with only one clone, Jean-Bernard Delmas has stated, \\"You need an assemblage of excellent clones\\", adding, \\"We know where each plant is located\\". At Haut-Brion, each hectare contains 10 to 15 different clonal selections. in 1975, at the age of 83, Seymour Weller retired as President of the company. His cousin's daughter and granddaughter of Clarence Dillon, Joan Dillon, then Princesse Charles de Luxembourg and later Duchesse de Mouchy, replaced him. In 1976, the 1970 vintage of Haut-Brion ranked fourth among the ten French and California red wines in the historic \\"Judgment of Paris\\" wine competition. The fierce competition that had existed between Haut- Brion and Ch√¢teau La Mission Haut-Brion over several years, which rose to a peak in the 1970s and early 1980s, ended when Domaine Clarence Dillon acquired La Mission in 1983. From the 2007 vintage, in connection with the 75-year anniversary of Dillon family ownership, the red second wine Ch√¢teau Bahans Haut-Brion was released under the new name Le Clarence de Haut-Brion. The name Ch√¢teau Bahans Haut-Brion had been in use for at least a century, and over a period it was sold without a declared vintage. Starting with the 2009 vintage, the white second wine Les Plantiers du Haut-Brion was renamed La Clart√© de Haut-Brion. Manager Jean-Bernard Delmas retired in 2003, and was succeeded by his son Jean-Philippe Delmas. Prince Robert of Luxembourg (son of Prince Charles of Luxembourg) who has acted as an administrator at Haut-Brion since the age of 18, became in 2008 Pr√©sident Directeur G√©n√©ral of Domaine Clarence Dillon. Production Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion devotes to red grape varieties, with a distribution of 45.4% Merlot, 43.9% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9.7% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot, and to white grape varieties, distributed with 52.6% S√©millon and 47.4% Sauvignon blanc.Delmas, Jean-Philippe (January 2009) The vineyards are elevated, up to 27 meters, somewhat above the Bordeaux norm. The soil consists of G√ºnzian gravel and some parcels have high contents of clay. All the vineyards are located in a cluster near the ch√¢teau itself and on the other side of the main road. The selection of optimum rootstocks and clones has been a large task at Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion, pioneered by Jean-Bernard Delmas, which has greatly contributed to the quality of the plant material in the vineyard. The long-term aim has been to lower yields, not by green-harvesting but by ensuring healthy and balanced vines. The average age of the vines is approximately 35 years with the oldest parcels dating back to the 1930s, planted with an average vine density of 8000 vines/ha. Harvesting takes place by hand and each parcel is worked by the same team of workers to increase the teams' familiarity with the individual vines. The harvest of the white grapes takes place very early due to the proximity to the city of Bordeaux which results in a warmer microclimate and thus earlier ripening. The white grapes are picked as late as possible, sorted and then pneumatically pressed in whole bunches. There is no skin contact and fermentation takes place in oak barrels with indigenous yeast. After sorting in the field, the red grapes are destemmed, crushed and moved to a special double-tank with fermentation taking place in the top and malolactic fermentation in the bottom, using gravity to move the wine. Previously ageing took place in 100% new oak casks lasting 18 months. This has been reduced to 35% new casks and wine destined for the second wine Le Clarence is aged in 25% new oak. The white wine is aged in 40-45% new oak for 10‚Äì12 months. Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion has its own cooperage. The annual production ranges from of the red grand vin Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion, and from of Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion Blanc. Of the second wines, the red Le Clarence de Haut-Brion previously named Ch√¢teau Bahans Haut-Brion, has a production of , and the white La Clart√© de Haut- Brion, previously named Les Plantiers du Haut-Brion, has a production of .

It is held annually in mid-August on the State Fairgrounds in Lewisburg, West Virginia. The 2021 State Fair of West Virginia is scheduled for August 12th-21st. The State Fairgrounds consists of a large open park for carnivals and exhibition, grandstands, and several exhibition buildings. Free parking is provided adjacent to the fairgrounds. Over the years the following concerts have been held at the grandstand ‚Ä¢Conway Twitty ‚Ä¢Loretta Lynn ‚Ä¢George Jones ‚Ä¢Merle Haggard ‚Ä¢Johnny Cash ‚Ä¢Lorrie Morgan ‚Ä¢Little Big Town ‚Ä¢Britney Spears ‚Ä¢Big Time Rush ‚Ä¢Victoria Justice ‚Ä¢Tammy Wynette ‚Ä¢Travis Tritt At the 2019 State Fair Alabama was scheduled to perform but Randy Owen became ill. Jamey Johnson filled in for Alabama. History The first event to be called the State Fair occurred in Wheeling on February 1, 1881. The Lewisburg fair evolved from local events that date back to 1854. 1917‚Äì18 saw the fair get cancelled. In 1941 the state government declared it to be the official State Fair. However, World War II forced cancellation of the event until 1946. The Meadow River Lumber Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. And the COVID-19 pandemic forced the 2020 fair to be scrapped & deferred to 2021. Current activities By the standards of large states with a more agricultural economies, the West Virginia event is relatively small. It lasts over eight days. It features a traveling carnival with various rides, competitive exhibitions by farmers and 4-H and FFA members, harness racing (no gambling is currently allowed), exhibitions by manufacturers of farm machinery and industrial tools, and a nightly concert performed by popular artists. Higher stakes Bingo is conducted at the fair than is normally permitted under state law. A beauty queen is selected. In political years, elaborate displays by candidates and political parties are also a part of the fair. Midway Rides are provided by the Orange unit of Reithoffer Shows. The 2006 fair generated 174,438 paid admissions, which was the highest number since 2002; that year, security screens were set up at the gates. Adding children under five (who are admitted free) and various other complementary admissions brings the estimated attendance to 210,000. Prior to the completion of Interstate 64 in 1988 the fairground was difficult to access from most of the state and the event was much more local in nature. However, it has grown greatly since that time. The Fair is a non-profit organization under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Although the Fair does not release its financial statements to the public, managers claim that it operates on a \\"small margin.\\" According to a 2006 report commissioned by the Fair, it has an annual economic impact of $8.9 million on Greenbrier County. The Fair receives no appropriation from the state, supporting itself from admissions, fees charged to vendors, and rental of the fairgrounds to other groups. It does receive support in kind from the state Department of Agriculture and from West Virginia University.

It was published by Dark Horse Comics in February-July 1996, It follows the usual black and white noir style artistry of previous Sin City novels, with the exception of yellow on Roark Junior late in the story. It is one of the comics adapted into the Sin City film. Plot The story begins more than eight years before any other Sin City book takes place, with policeman John Hartigan on his final mission before his forced retirement (he suffers from severe angina). Roark Junior, son of one of the most powerful and corrupt officials in Basin City, is indulging his penchant for raping and murdering pre-pubescent girls. It is Hartigan's mission to rescue Junior's latest quarry, an 11-year-old named Nancy Callahan. Hartigan succeeds in rescuing Nancy by disabling Junior's getaway car, which was being guarded by Burt Schlubb and Douglas Klump, two guns-for-hire with \\"delusions of eloquence\\". Hartigan knocks them out and kills the twin guards Benny and Lenny. He chases the escaping Junior to the pier and then proceeds to use his revolver to surgically shoot off Junior's left ear, right hand, and genitals. Before he can finish Junior off, Hartigan's corrupt partner Bob, who fears angering Senator Roark, shoots Hartigan several times. Hartigan then stalls Bob for as long as he can to save Nancy when backup arrives, going so far as to pull a spare gun and have Bob unload his gun on him. Bob leaves the fallen Hartigan, who passes out with Nancy in his arms. Roark Jr. lapses into a coma from his injuries, and Senator Roark takes issue with the abuse of his son. Hartigan survives and recovers thanks to the senator, who wants Hartigan to suffer for the rest of his life. He is framed for raping Nancy, branded as a pedophile and sentenced to a lengthy prison term amid a public outcry that brands him one of Sin City's most hated citizens. He remains silent about his pain, knowing that Senator Roark would execute anyone who ever found out the truth. The only one to whom Hartigan speaks in the hospital is Nancy, who sneaks out against her parents' wishes to see the man who saved her. Hartigan tells her to stay away from him, so Nancy tells Hartigan she will write him letters instead. She will sign her name as \\"Cordelia\\" to hide her identity. Before leaving, Nancy tells Hartigan she loves him. After his stint in the hospital, Hartigan is seen tied to a chair, cuffed and being beaten by Det. Liebowitz in order to force him to sign a false confession. Amid the hours of repeated punching and being tempted by prison luxuries and even sex with an Old Town prostitute, Hartigan doesn't crack under the pressure, although he hallucinates that he is granted the strength of Hercules, breaks from his cuffs and kills Liebowitz by exploding his head. Afterwards, alone in prison and abandoned by his wife Eileen (who remarries and finally has children) and his friends, he finds solace in the carefully disguised weekly letters he receives from Nancy. Hartigan quickly develops a paternal love for young Nancy, and sees her as the daughter he never had. For eight years, he drags himself through his jail time, his only respite the letters his young admirer sends him, until finally the letters stop coming. Although he initially believes Nancy has merely outgrown her childhood hero, Hartigan soon becomes increasingly worried that Senator Roark has finally found her. His fears are confirmed when a deformed, hairless visitor with sickly yellow skin who smells distinctly like garbage arrives at his prison cell and punches him out. Hartigan awakens and discovers the same type of envelope Nancy always uses containing an index finger from the right hand of a 19-year-old girl. Cover to That Yellow Bastard #4. Art by Frank Miller. Roark Jr. reborn as the Yellow Bastard. Believing Nancy to be in imminent danger, Hartigan decides to find some way out, and contacts his lawyer, Lucille (the lesbian parole officer from The Hard Goodbye). Much to her surprise and disgust, Hartigan decides to claim responsibility to the crimes of which he was accused. At his parole hearing, he is humiliated again when Senator Roark piously offers to forgive him. Hartigan knows it's a ruse to insult him, but asks Senator Roark for forgiveness in order to win parole. Hartigan is finally released, apparently due to Senator Roark's satisfaction over his confession and submission. Back on the streets, the now 60-year-old Hartigan sets off to find Nancy. He goes to her apartment, but finds it empty and in disarray. The only clue to her whereabouts is a pack of matches from Kadie's bar. Following the lead, Hartigan discovers that she is now a woman who works in the club as an exotic dancer - and is unharmed. The envelope containing the finger was merely a ploy to lead Roark to Nancy. Hartigan smells a set-up, and something far worse: the distinct odor of rotting garbage. \\"That Yellow Bastard\\", the man who arrived at the cell with the envelope, has followed him and found Nancy. Nancy recognizes Hartigan and jumps into his arms, kissing him. They leave Kadie's and get into her car. There is a high-speed pursuit, with the \\"Bastard\\" close on their tail, Hartigan uses Nancy's revolver to fire a precise shot that hits the \\"Bastard\\" in the neck. Hartigan insists on stopping to confirm the kill; accompanied by Nancy, he discovers the \\"Bastard's\\" foul-smelling blood everywhere, but no body. Eventually, he and Nancy hide out in a motel. There, they share a kiss, where Nancy reveals she is in love with him; but Hartigan refuses to move any further because of his age and the paternalistic nature of his relationship to Nancy. Unknown to them, the \\"Bastard\\" has hidden in the backseat of Nancy's car, and emerges while they talk. Hartigan, in the shower, is ambushed once again by \\"That Yellow Bastard\\", who reveals himself to be none other than Roark Junior. Senator Roark used his vast financial resources to resurrect his son using new medical techniques to re-grow his severed body parts. As a result, Junior lives, but with some \\"side-effects\\". Junior knocks Hartigan down, lynches him naked with a noose, and boasts of raping and killing dozens of girls over the past eight years. He then taunts Hartigan with the promise that Nancy will suffer the same fate. Roark Jr. kicks the desk out from under Hartigan and escapes with Nancy. That Yellow Bastard #6. Art by Frank Miller. Hartigan is shown beating Roark Jr to death. At first, Hartigan resigns himself to death but, in a sudden bout of determination, he revives himself through sheer will, breaks a window and cuts his hands free with a glass shard. Schlubb and Klump arrive to dispose of Hartigan's body, but Hartigan subdues them and forces them to reveal Junior and Nancy's whereabouts. He learns that Junior has fled to the Roark Family Farm (described as \\"a place where bad things happen\\"). Racing to the Farm, Hartigan suffers a severe angina attack, but soldiers through the pain. Meanwhile, Nancy is being flogged by Junior but, like Hartigan, resists the urge to scream in order to deny her torturer the satisfaction; she then realizes that Junior is impotent unless he hears his victims scream. Hartigan takes down four other corrupt police officers guarding the Farm and confronts Junior, who by that time has Nancy at knife point. Hartigan fakes a heart attack to catch Junior off guard. He stabs Junior, castrates him (this time with his bare hands), and beats him to death. Nancy and Hartigan share another, more passionate, kiss, and Hartigan tells Nancy to flee, assuring her that he will call up some old police friends of his to clean up the scene of the crime. After Nancy leaves, Hartigan narrates that he had to lie to her in order to protect her; Senator Roark will want to punish Hartigan for killing his son, and would not hesitate to use Nancy in order to do so. Knowing full well that no sane attorney would try to prosecute Senator Roark, Hartigan realizes that there is only one way to end the entire ordeal. In an act of pure love and sacrifice, Hartigan shoots himself in the head to save Nancy and end Roark's vendetta.

Plot Inside her apartment, a frightened Shellie is comforted by Dwight - with a new face since the events of A Dame To Kill For - as the drunken Jackie Boy bangs on the door. Dwight tells Shellie to let Jack and his entourage in, confident he can 'handle them'. Jackie Boy enters and insists Shellie call her fellow barmaids to join his pub crawl but she refuses, and Jack hits her. He goes to the bathroom where Dwight ambushes him with a straight razor and tells him to stop bothering Shellie, dunking his head in the toilet. Jack storms out with his posse. Shellie finds Dwight on the ledge outside the building; determined to stop Jack from causing more trouble, Dwight pursues him, ignoring Shellie's muffled yell that sounds like \\"Stop!\\". Speeding after Jack's car, Dwight catches the attention of police, who follow them to the border of Old Town, the area of Sin City populated by prostitutes. Walking alone, Becky rejects Jack‚Äôs request for her services. In pursuit, Dwight meets Gail, one of Old Town's most experienced hookers and guardians, who advises him to let the girls handle Jack themselves. Spotting Miho on the roof, he agrees. When Jack pulls a handgun on Becky, Miho throws a Manji-shaped shuriken that cuts off Jack's hand, then descends on the car and kills his entourage. Jack aims his gun at Miho, who throws a plug into the barrel. Jack tries to shoot Dwight and the gun shatters, embedding the slide into his forehead.

He is taunted by Jack‚Äôs corpse and is pulled over by police, who let him off with a warning for a broken taillight. At the Tar Pits, Dwight is attacked by Irish mercenaries and is seemingly killed by a shot to the chest. The mercenaries finds Jackie Boy's badge, having stopped the bullet, and Dwight disposes of several of them but is knocked into the pits with the sinking car. A mercenary removes Jackie Boy's head as proof of his murder, and leaves Dwight for dead. Miho rescues Dwight, and he deduces that an informant in Old Town has told the mob of Jack‚Äôs death. Dwight takes off with Miho and her driver, Dallas, in pursuit of the remaining mercenaries. In Old Town, Gail is kidnapped and tortured by Manute, having survived his previous encounter with Dwight and Miho. Gail refuses to \\"facilitate\\" the process of surrendering Old Town; she learns Becky has sold them out, and bites a chunk off of her neck.

In the film, Clive Owen plays Dwight, Brittany Murphy plays Shellie, Benicio del Toro plays Jack, Rosario Dawson plays Gail, Devon Aoki plays Miho, Alexis Bledel plays Becky, and Michael Clarke Duncan plays Manute. A notable difference from the comic version is that Becky survives the final gunfight by hiding in a nook in the alley, leaving her alive for the final \\"epilogue\\" scene of the movie which ends when she meets The Salesman from The Customer is Always Right, who had been introduced in the movie's prologue. He then offers her a cigarette just like he did in The Customer is Always Right, and Becky seems to sense why he's there and tells her mother she loves her before hanging up. There is also a deleted/extended scene from the movie, where Manute and two thugs actually escape the gunfight, bloodied and battered, only to be cornered by Miho in the alley. Miho then tosses the sword right through the two thugs, and finally and definitely kills Manute by bisecting him with a scythe.

T. Lane, , Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, , pp. 98-99. In his youth he was influenced by the atmosphere of the Bulgarian National Revival. In his memoirs written in 1922, Blagoev mentions that he was born in a pure Bulgarian village, receiving his national idea by Bulgarian agitators and as a result he was educated in nationalist spirit.Dimitar Blagoev, Short notes from my life, 1926, p.1Entangled Paths Towards Modernity: Contextualizing Socialism and Nationalism in the Balkans, Augusta Dimou, Central European University Press, 2009, , p. 45. He learned consequently in Bulgarian Exarchate's schools in Istanbul (1873‚Äì1874), Adrianople (1874‚Äì1875), Gabrovo (1875‚Äì1876) and Stara Zagora (1876‚Äì1877). As a student in Gabrovo he supported the cause of the April uprising, and participated on its preparation. During the Russo-Turkish War, he supported the activity of the opalchentsi and the Russian Army.–°–æ—Ñ–∏—è –í–∞—Å–∏–ª–µ–≤–∞, ¬© –ï–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–æ —Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ LiterNet, 10.10.2006, ‚Ññ 10 (83) –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Å—Ç–µ–Ω–æ–ø–∏—Å–∏ –≤ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–∑–∞–≥–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ —Ü—ä—Ä–∫–≤–∞ \\"–°–≤. –î–∏–º–∏—Ç—ä—Ä\\". Later he studied at the Odessa Realschule from 1878 to 1880. In autumn 1880, Blagoev enrolled in Saint Petersburg University. In the Russian capital, he was originally influenced by the populist ideas of Lavrov those of the French anarchist Proudhon. But by the autumn of 1883, reading the first volume of Das Kapital, by Karl Marx, and works by the German socialist Lassalle, and pamphlet Socialism and the Political Struggle written by the exiled Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov had converted him to Marxism. In 1884, he formed the first Marxist group to operate within Russia, which was known as the Blagoev Group. In 1885, the group produced a newspaper, \\"Rabochii\\" (Worker), Russia's first Marxist publication. Also in 1885, it aligned with PLekhanov's Emancipation of Labour Group, based in Switzerland. In 1883, Blagoev met and married the teacher, writer, and women's activist Vela Blagoeva (n√©e Victoria Atanasova Zhivkova) with whom he would have four children: Stela, Natalia, Vladimir and Dimitur. Return to Bulgaria Blagoev was arrested on 1 March 1885, and extradited to Bulgaria, settled in Sofia and began to propagate socialist ideas. In July 1891, on his initiative, the social democratic circles of Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Sliven, Stara Zagora, Kazanlak and other cities united to form the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party (BSDP). The marxist nucleus of the BSDP was opposed by a group, who were essentially opposed to making the social democratic movement into a party. In 1893 this group, led by Yanko Sakazov, founded a reformist organization, the Bulgarian Social Democratic Union. In 1894, Blagoev‚Äôs supporters agreed to unite with the Unionists in the interests of working class unity and took the name Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party. He was a founder and became the leader of its left wing, which split from the BSDWP in 1903 to found the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party (Narrow Socialists).History of the Balkans: Twentieth century, Joint Committee on Eastern Europe publication series, Barbara Jelavich, Cambridge University Press, , p. 138. Blagoev was also activist of the Plovdiv Macedonian- Adrianople Committee, and its chairman from 1897. In 1898 Gotse Delchev made attempt to convince him to lead the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee, but he refused. Under his guidance the foundations of the class trade-union movement was laid in 1904. From 1897 to 1923 Blagoev directed the publication of the party‚Äôs theoretical organ, the journal \\"Novo vreme\\", which published more than 500 of his articles. Meanwhile, he worked as teacher in different cities in Bulgaria. In 1905, Blagoev translated into Bulgarian the first volume of Das Kapital and a number of other works by Marx. Blagoev‚Äôs book \\"From the History of Socialism in Bulgaria\\" was published in 1906 and it has initiated Bulgarian Marxist historiography. He led the delegations of narrow socialists at the Balkan socialist conferences in Belgrade (1910) and Bucharest (1915). Wartime activities and stance He was against foreign intervention by the Great Powers in Southeast Europe, believed in a Balkan Federative Republic and opposed Bulgaria's military engagements in the Second Balkan War and First World War. A deputy to the National Assembly of Bulgaria, Blagoev voted in October 1914, along with the rest of the faction of narrow socialists, against war credits. During World War I as deputy Blagoev exposed \\"the war‚Äôs imperialist nature and the traitorous role of the Second International\\". Blagoev hailed the Russian October Revolution and propagandized for the ideas of the Bolsheviks. Under his leadership the Narrow Socialist party broke with the Second International. In a speech before the Bulgarian National Assembly in 1917, Blagoev called himself \\"Macedonian Slav\\".–û—Ä–¥–µ –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ—Å–∫–∏. ‚Äû–ò—Å–∫–∞–∂—É–≤–∞—ö–µ –Ω–∞ –î–∏–º–∏—Ç–∞—Ä –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ–µ–≤ –∑–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∏—Ç–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥ –ë—É–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏–æ—Ç –ø–∞—Ä–ª–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç –≤–æ 1917‚Äú (–°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–æ—Å—Ç, –°–∫–æ–ø—ò–µ), –à–∞–Ω—É–∞—Ä–∏ 1967.–ë–∏–±–ª. –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞ –í., –ö—É–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –ú., –ö—Ä–∞—Ç—ä–∫ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫, —Ç.

In a Declaration against the Treaty of Neuilly, read by Dimiter Blagoev in the Bulgarian National Assembly in 1919 he protested against the partition of the Bulgarian land and nation and promoted the ideas of the Bulgarian Soviet Socialist Republic, as a part of a Balkan Federal Soviet Socialist Republic, as the only political solution able to assure freedom of Macedonia, Thrace and Dobruja and as a counterweight of Bulgarian nationalism.Declaration of the Bulgarian Communist Party against the Neuilly Peace Treaty, read by Dimiter Blagoev in the National Assembly. Later years and death Blagoev led the Narrow Socialists into the Communist International in 1919, and the party changed its name to the Bulgarian Communist Party. However, during this period Blagoev and the party as a whole did not completely adopt Bolshevik's positions on the basic questions. This determined the party‚Äôs policies during the Vladaya Soldiers‚Äô Rebellion of 1918 and the military coup of 9 June 1923 when the party adopted a position of neutrality. He was also an opponent of the failed September Uprising and thought that there were no ripe conditions for a revolution in Bulgaria yet. Blagoev was also author of a number of research essays on questions of Marxist philosophy, political economy, history, esthetics, and Bulgarian literature. He died in Sofia, Bulgaria.

The Moldavian Democratic Republic (), also known as the Moldavian Republic, was a state proclaimed on by the Sfatul »öƒÉrii (National Council) of Bessarabia, elected in October‚ÄìNovember 1917 following the February Revolution and the start of the disintegration of the Russian Empire. The Sfatul »öƒÉrii was its legislative body, while the \\"Council of Directors General\\", renamed the \\"Council of Ministers\\" after the Declaration of Independence, was its government. The Republic was proclaimed on 2/15 December 1917, as a result of the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia. The anthem of the country was De»ôteaptƒÉ-te, rom√¢ne!.  History =Summarized The brief history of the 1917-1918 Moldavian Democratic Republic can be divided into three periods: the period of autonomy within Russia, the period of independence, and the period of federation with Romania. On 2/15 December, Moldavia proclaimed itself a constituent republic of the Russian Federative Democratic Republic. On 1/14 January 1918, the Front Section of the Rumcherod Bolsheviks entered Chi»ôinƒÉu, the capital of the nascent republic. After the nationalist faction of the Sfatul »öƒÉrii requested military assistance from Romania, the Romanian Army crossed the republic's border on 10/23 January, taking the capital within days. With the Romanian Army in full control, on 24 January/6 February, the Moldavian Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence. On 27 March/9 April, Moldavia entered a conditioned union (essentially a federation) with the Kingdom of Romania, retaining its provincial autonomy as well as its legislative body (the Sfatul »öƒÉrii). On 27 November/10 December, after the end of World War I, a secret meeting of Sfatul »öƒÉrii members renounced all conditions and proclaimed the unconditional union of Bessarabia with Romania, effectively amounting to an annexation by the latter.Marcel Mitrasca, Algora Publishing, 2007, Moldova: A Romanian Province Under Russian Rule : Diplomatic History from the Archives of the Great Powers, pp. 34-39 This was its last act, as it was subsequently dissolved and prominent unionists were invited to Bucharest.Vladimir Ubeivolc, Langham Monographs, 2016, Rethinking Missio Dei among Evangelical Churches in an Eastern European Orthodox Context, p. 29 During its 1-year existence, the Moldavian Democratic Republic had three Prime Ministers: Pantelimon Erhan, Daniel Ciugureanu and Petru Cazacu. Detailed When the February Revolution occurred in Petrograd in 1917, the governor of the Bessarabia Governorate stepped down and passed his legal powers to Constantin Mimi, the President of the Gubernial Zemstvo, which was named the Commissar of the Provisional Government in Bessarabia, with Vladimir Criste his deputy. Similar procedures took place in all regions of the Russian Empire: the chiefs of the Tsarist administrations passed their legal powers to the chiefs of the County and Governorate Zemstvos, which were then called County/Governorate Commissars.Ion Nistor, p. 279 The Peasants' Congress, which took place in October 1917, voted Mimi out and Ion Incule»õ in as the new Commissar. This move was planned by Alexander Kerensky, who sent Incule»õ, an associate professor at the University of Petrograd, to Bessarabia to take hold of the situation. As soon as the Peasants' Congress, which had no legal power, voted, Kerenski formally replaced Mimi with Incule»õ. When Incule»õ arrived in Chi»ôinƒÉu to take power, he faced the quiet opposition of the nobility, so he agreed to take the position of deputy commissar to Vladimir Criste. When the republic was proclaimed, Criste stepped down and passed his legal powers to Incule»õ. The Sfatul »öƒÉrii (National Council) of Bessarabia was elected in October‚ÄìNovember 1917, and started to work in December 1917. It proclaimed the Moldavian Democratic Republic as a federal subject (autonomous republic) of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic. In the context of the October Revolution, the Russian Army on the Romanian Front disintegrated. The large number of retreating soldiers increased the level of anarchy in Bessarabia, leaving the National Council with only minimal authority over the territory. To further complicate matters, as the Council was delaying a decision on the agrarian question, peasants across the region started to break up the estates of the large landowners and divide them among themselves. As the General Staff of the Romanian Front was unable to send any troops, attempts were made to organize a Moldavian National Guard, but the results were far from expectations. Furthermore, most of the army corps nominally subjected to the National Council came under Bolshevik influence. However, in mid-January Romanians entered the country, engaged in battles with the Moldavian and Bolshevik troops and within a couple of weeks controlled much of the country.van Meurs, Wim, The Bessarabian question in communist historiography, East European Monographs, 1994, p. 65 Among the leaders of Moldavian troops that offered resistance were also figures formerly loyal to the National Council, such as captain Anatolie Popa. Following the signing of separate peace armistices by Imperial Germany with Romania, Ukraine and Bolshevik Russia the Sfatul »öƒÉrii, with 86 votes in favour, 3 against and 36 abstentions, proclaimed the Union of Bessarabia with the Kingdom of Romania on , with the condition of local autonomy and the continuation of Bessarabian legislative and executive bodies, legally ending the Moldavian Democratic Republic. Discouraged by the fact that the Romanian troops were already present in Chi»ôinƒÉu, many minority deputies abstained from voting.Cristina Petrescu, \\"Contrasting/Conflicting Identities:Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans\\" in Nation-Building and Contested Identities, Polirom, 2001, pg. 156King, C. The Moldovans: Romania, Russia and the Politics of Culture, Hoover Institution Press, 2000, pg. 35 The union was confirmed in the Treaty of Paris (1920).  Leadership  The leadership of the Moldavian Republic was composed of Ion Incule»õ, the president of the Sfatul »öƒÉrii and President of the Republic; and Pantelimon Erhan, the President of the Council of Directors General. The new leadership and Council was put in place after the country was declared independence by Daniel Ciugureanu, as President of the Council of Ministers. The Sfatul »öƒÉrii was initially composed of 120 elected members, although member numbers were later increased to 135 and then 150. For example, on 9 April, there were 138 legislators, of which 125 took part in the vote, and 13 were absent. On , the Sfatul »öƒÉrii elected the government of the Moldavian Democratic Republic - the Council of Directors General, with nine members, seven Moldavians, one Ukrainian, and one Jew: * Pantelimon Erhan, President of the Council, and Director General for Agriculture. * Vladimir Criste, Director General for Internal Affairs. * »òtefan Ciobanu, Director General for Education. * Teofil Ioncu, Director General for Finance. * Nicolae N. Codreanu, Director General for Railways. * Major Teodor Cojocaru, Director General for Armed Forces. * Mihail Savenco, Director General for Justice. * E. Grinfeld, Director General for Industry and Trade. * Ion Pelivan, Director General for Foreign Affairs. In its first decree, the Council set forward the aim to \\"introduce order in all the aspects of life of the country, to eliminate anarchy and disaster, to organize all the aspects of state administration\\". An Executive Clerk Office (Cancelarie) of the Council of Directors General was set up, and all state, public and private institutions were required to communicate through the Executive Clerk Office to the corresponding Director General for all questions regarding the government of the country. All acts in the domain of public administration made without the previous consent of the respective Directors-General were declared legally void, while the director freed from responsibility for such acts.Halipa, Moraru, p.74-75  Gallery  File:–î–µ–∫–ª–∞—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è_–æ_–ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∑–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏–∏_–ú–æ–ª–¥–∞–≤—Å–∫–æ–π_–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π_–†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏.jpgDeclaration of the Moldovan People's Republic.

The Dirichlet eta function is given by :\\\\,\\\\eta(s)=\\\\Phi (-1,s,1). Identities For Œª rational, the summand is a root of unity, and thus L(\\\\lambda, \\\\alpha, s) may be expressed as a finite sum over the Hurwitz zeta-function. Suppose \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{p}{q} with p, q \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} and q > 0.

History \\"Alabama\\" was written as a poem by Julia Tutwiler, a distinguished educator and humanitarian. It was first sung to an Austrian air, but in 1931, the music written by Edna Gockel Gussen, an organist, and choirmaster from Birmingham, Alabama, was adopted by the State Federation of Music Clubs and through their efforts, House Joint Resolution 74 was adopted March 9, 1931. Act no. 126, adopted the music and words as the state song of Alabama. The bill was introduced by the Hon. Tyler Goodwyn, Montgomery, and was signed into law by Governor B. M. Miller. The inspiration for writing the poem Alabama came to Julia Tutwiler after she returned to her native state from Germany, where she had been studying new educational methods for girls and women. She recalled that in Germany patriotism was inspired by spirited songs. She thought that it would be helpful toward restoring the spirits of her own people to give them a new patriotic song, inspiring her to write \\"Alabama.\\" Lyrics : Alabama, Alabama, We will aye be true to thee, : From thy Southern shores where groweth, : By the sea thine orange tree. : To thy Northern vale where floweth, : Deep blue the Tennessee, : Alabama, Alabama, We will aye be true to thee! : Broad thy stream whose name thou bearest; : Grand thy Bigbee rolls along; : Fair thy Coosa-Tallapoosa : Bold thy Warrior, dark and strong, : Goodlier than the land that Moses : Climbed lone Nebo's Mount to see, : Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee! : From thy prairies, broad and fertile, : Where thy snow-white cotton shines. : To the hills where coal and iron, : Hide in thy exhaustless mines, : Strong-armed miners -sturdy farmers; : Loyal hearts what'er we be, : Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee! : From thy quarries where the marble : White as that of Paros gleams : Waiting till thy sculptor's chisel, : Wake to life thy poet's dreams; : Fear not only wealth of nature, : Wealth of mind hast thou no fee, : Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee! : Where the perfumed south-wind whispers, : Thy magnolia groves among, : Softer than a mother's kisses, : Sweeter than a mother's song, : Where the golden jasmine trailing, : Woos the treasure-laden bee, : Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee! : Brave and pure thy men and women, : Better this than corn and wine : Make us worthy, God in Heaven : Of this goodly land of Thine. : Hearts as open as thy doorways. : Liberal hands and spirits free. : Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee! : Little, little can I give thee, : Alabama, mother mine. : But that little - hand, brain, spirit. : All I have and am are thine. : Take, O take, the gift and giver. : Take and serve thyself with me. : Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee!

He was a member of the Rockefeller family. Early life  Rockefeller was born in New York City, New York, the only child of Arkansas Governor Winthrop Rockefeller (1912‚Äî1973) and actress Jievute \\"Bobo\\" Paulekiute (1916‚Äî2008). His parents separated in 1950 and divorced four years later. His maternal grandparents were Lithuanian.http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/bobo-rockefeller-91-married- well-divorced-better/76767/ Rockefeller grew up in both the United States and in Europe and was educated at schools in New York, England, and in Switzerland. He graduated from Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas with a degree in Ranch Management. Career Rockefeller served from 1981 to 1995 on the Arkansas State Police Commission. In 1991, he was appointed by President George H. W. Bush to serve on the President‚Äôs Council on Rural America and became chairman of the council. He was a president of the Quapaw Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America and served on the board of directors of the national Scouting organization. He was elected his state's lieutenant governor in a November 1996 special election triggered by the resignation of Governor Jim Guy Tucker and the succession to the governorship of then- Lieutenant Governor Mike Huckabee. Rockefeller was subsequently re-elected in 1998 to a full four-year term with 67 percent of the vote, far greater than the vote received by his father in the 1966 and 1968 gubernatorial elections. Rockefeller was elected once again in 2002 with 60 percent of the vote. According to his website: \\"As Lieutenant Governor he focused on economic development, education and literacy. As Acting Governor on September 11, 2001, the day terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, he resisted calls to declare a state of emergency and instead urged Arkansans to remain calm and to donate blood. He sponsored Project ChildSafe, a national firearms safety program that has distributed hundreds of thousands of free trigger locks in Arkansas. He was honorary chairman of the Arkansas Literary Festival. In 1997, Rockefeller created Books in the Attic, a program using existing resources, Boy Scouts, and volunteers to ensure access to reading opportunities for all children. In 2004, he served as the chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party.Arkansas Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter Personal life On March 22, 1971, Rockefeller married Deborah Cluett Sage of New York, the eldest daughter of Louis Davidson Sage and the former Constance Cluett Ward. The couple met while both were studying in Oxford, England. The wedding took place at the Bruton Parish Church at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. The couple had three children: *Andrea Davidson Rockefeller (b. July 31, 1972) *Katherine Cluett Rockefeller (b. February 7, 1974) *Winthrop Paul Rockefeller Jr. (b. July 10, 1976) The couple divorced on January 11, 1979. On June 4, 1983, Rockefeller married Lisenne Dudderar, an administrative assistant with the Arkansas Nature Conservancy. They had four sons: *William Gordon Rockefeller *Colin Kendrick Rockefeller (born c. 1990) *John Alexander Camp Rockefeller *Louis Henry Rockefeller They adopted a daughter, Grace, in Hong Kong. Win and Lisenne founded a school for children with learning disabilities in Little Rock, now known as the Academy at Riverdale. Wealth Rockefeller served as chief executive of Winrock Farms, Inc., which had been set up by his father, and had interests in various small businesses around the state: in retailing, automobiles, farming, and the resort industry. He was an active member of the National Federation of Independent Business. Rockefeller was ranked # 283 on the Forbes magazine list of the nation's wealthiest people in 2005, with a fortune the magazine estimated at $1.2 billion. As lieutenant governor, which was a part-time job, he forwarded his $34,673 state salary to charity.Ark. Lt. Gov. Win Paul Rockefeller dies - USA Today, 16 July 2006 Illness and death Rockefeller had announced his candidacy for governor and was expected to face the more conservative Asa Hutchinson in the Republican primary election in May 2006. On July 20, 2005, however, he bowed out of the race, citing myeloproliferative disease, a blood disorder that can develop into leukemia if left untreated. In October 2005 and March 2006, Rockefeller underwent unsuccessful bone marrow transplants at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. On July 8, 2006, after the failure of his second bone marrow transplant, he returned to Little Rock, where he died eight days later at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. On July 19, his body lay in state in the rotunda of the Arkansas State Capitol, and the next day, a memorial service was held at Pulaski Heights United Methodist Church, of which Rockefeller was a member. At the time of his death, he was survived by his mother, wife, children, and one granddaughter. See also *Rockefeller family *Winthrop Rockefeller ReferencesExternal links *\\"Arkansas Lt. Gov.

While a fairly minor figure in the Venetian School, he was a competent composer of madrigals and wrote a few works in the grand Venetian polychoral style.  Biography  Nothing is known about him prior to his appearance in Padua in 1567 as an organist at Crosieri Cathedral. That same year he tried to gain the prestigious job as first organist of the cathedral there. In 1568 he acquired the position of primary organist at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, a Venetian establishment almost as prestigious as St. Mark's; he held this post until 1584 at which time he returned to Padua to take the post at the cathedral that he at first failed to win. In December 1585 he was fired from his job in Padua, probably because of an unexcused absence, but he returned to Venice to become organist of yet another Venetian church, Santo Stefano. In 1586 he became first organist at St. Mark's, the position just vacated by Andrea Gabrieli; thus he was first organist alongside Giovanni Gabrieli, who was second organist. Unfortunately Bellavere died after only holding this post for nine months. Bellavere was a talented composer and could have become a major member of the Venetian school, had his career not been cut short; possibly he died fairly young, though reliable information on his age is missing.  Works  Bellavere wrote, besides keyboard works (being an organist), choral works, notably madrigals in a light style reminiscent of Andrea Gabrieli, as well as four motets and two settings of the Magnificat. His last music shows a progressive use of the multiple choir and instrument group style that was to make Giovanni Gabrieli famous, and which is the hallmark of the Venetian School.

In Maharashtra the alternative term Urus is used as well. During the Zatra, the idol(s) or murtis of the Hindu deity or deities are taken out on special procession either in a \\"Palkhi\\" (sort of a Palanquin) or in a large, multi-storied chariot called the Rath. Traditionally, every temple observes this festival once a year on the traditional day. All zatras usually occur after Diwali in October and continues until the Shigmo or Holi festival in March. The most famous Zatra of Goa is that of the temple of the Hindu deity Lairai at Shirgao, a place located roughly 30 km away from Panaji when people walk on burning coals with bare legs and that of deity Goddess Shantadurga at Village Fatorpa in Quepem Taluka; approx 50 km from Panaji and 18 km from Madgao. These Zatras can be compared to Mela (Hindi) for its other commercial and entertainment activities. Popular snacks sold and consumed during zatra are ladu which is the local name for laddu and khaje which are fried chickpea flour sticks dipped in a jaggery and sesame mixture.Khaje - A popular snack in Goa zatra Also occurring during the Zatra is the phenomenon of possession, usually but not exclusively of women, by the spirit of the deity; this is called Bhar, whereby they act as oracles and claim to predict future events.

The city serves as a railway station in the Mineralnye Vody‚ÄîKislovodsk branch, and is located southwest of Mineralnye Vody and west of Pyatigorsk. It is considered the cultural capital of Russia's Greek population and even today close to ten percent of its population is of Greek descent. Population: History In 1798, the Russian military and border redoubt of Yessentuksky was laid on the right bank of the Bolshoy Yessentuchok River, near its confluence with the Podkumok River. After the construction of the Kislovodsk fortress in 1803, the redoubt was abolished, and only the Cossack post was kept on its site. The mineral waters of Yessentuki were first probed in 1810 by the Moscow doctor Fyodor Gaaz. Gaaz found two small wells with salty water (the present Gaazo-Ponomaryovsky spring) in the valley of the stream of Kislusha, about northeast of the Yessentuksky post. A detailed study of Bugunta mineral waters (the original name of the waters, after the Bugunta River flowing nearby) was made in 1823 by the Russian doctor and pharmacologist A. P. Nelyubin, who found twenty more mineral springs on the slopes of the mountain he referred to as Shchelochnaya (Nelyubin's numbering of the Yessentuki mineral waters is still maintained). In 1825, General Yermolov founded the stanitsa of Yessentukskaya on the Bugunta River northeast of the former Yessentuksky post; its inhabitants were engaged in trade, trucking, and serving arriving patients. In 1839, water from springs ##23-26 was led to the common pool, where the first two baths of the wooden bathhouse were built at the expense of the Cossack Regiment Management. Since 1840, springs ##4 and 17 have come into use and become especially popular. Yessentuki was recognized as one of the best health resorts for treatment of the digestive organs. In 1846, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov, the namestnik (vicegerent) of Caucasus, ordered to extend the territory of the stanitsa of Yessentukskaya to the northeast to approach the springs. Since then, Buguntinskiye mineral waters were referred to as Yessentukskiye. In 1847, some grounds closely adjacent to the springs were transferred to the newly established state Management of Waters in Pyatigorsk. In the late 1840s, bottling of Yessentuki waters and their dispatch to other cities of the country began. By the early 1870s, regular sale of the water was carried out in most of the large Russian cities. Construction of the Rostov-on- Don‚ÄìMineralnye Vody railway in 1875 and the Mineralnye Vody‚ÄìKislovodsk highway (via Pyatigorsk and Yessentuki) contributed to increase in the number of guests coming to Yessentuki for treatment. In 1883, the resort was visited by about 5,000 people; in 1900, by more than 13,000; in 1913, by 38,000. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, medical establishments, hotels, and summer residences were intensively built. In 1902, a seventy-bed sanatorium for the poor, the first one within the Caucasian Mineral Water system, was opened; in a year, the first departmental twenty-bed sanatorium for postal workers was built. In 1905, drilling of holes resulted in discovery of new springs (main spout of spring #17, new discharges of the water similar to the one of spring #4). In 1917, the resort area was separated from the stanitsa of Yessentukskaya and was granted town status. During the Russian Civil War, resort facilities of Yessentuki fell into decay. Restoration work began only in 1920. In 1922, the clinical branch of Pyatigorsk Balneal Institute (the present Pyatigorsk Research Institute of Balneology and Physiotherapy) was opened. In 1925, the health resort operated six sanatoria and treated the total of about 13,000 patients. During the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, the health resort was heavily damaged by Nazi occupation from August 10, 1942 to January 11, 1943 and was restored at the end of the 1940s. In 1991, Yessentuki provided rest and treatment for more than 217,000 patients. In 1991, the health resort operated twenty-five sanatoria, including ten belonging to the trade unions; the number of beds totaled over 10,000. It also provided outpatient treatment and board and treatment authorization. Service of guests involved such facilities as a resort polyclinic with aerosun rooms and climatic pavilions; a therapeutic mud bath; three bathhouses: Nizhniye (lower) baths (50 baths), Verkhniye (upper) baths (90 baths), and a new bathhouse (110 baths); 4 drinking galleries and well-rooms of springs ##4 and 17; an inhalatorium shared by all the resorts; a department of mechanotherapy, applying special techniques of therapeutic physical training. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of krai significance of Yessentuki‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Resolution #63-p As a municipal division, the city of krai significance of Yessentuki is incorporated as Yessentuki Urban Okrug.Law #88-kz Mineral springs Of all mineral springs of Yessentuki, about twenty are of medical value. Sodium carbonic hydrocarbonate-chloride (i.e. salt-alkaline) water of springs #4 and #17, which have made the health resort popular, are the most famous and therapeutically valuable. The hot springs (35.5¬∞‚Äì46 ¬∞C) similar to the waters of springs #4 and #17 in their structure have been led to the surface in the vicinities of the village of Novoblagodarnoye ( north of Yessentuki). The water of springs #4 and #17 and their analogues are used for peroral treatment. Carbonic hydrogen-sulphide water of holes #1 and #2, as well as calcium-sodium hydrosulphuric sulphate-hydrocarbonate (the so-called sulphur- alkaline) water of the Gaazo-Ponomarevsky spring are used for baths, lavages, inhalations and other balneotherapeutic procedures. Calcium-magnesium sulphate-hydrocarbonate water of spring #20 is used for baths. The water of springs #4 and #17 is bottled by a local bottler as a healing water (#17) and as a healing table water (#4) under the name of Yessentuki. Alongside mineral waters, the medical establishments of Yessentuki use sulphide silt muds of Tambukan Lake ( southeast of Pyatigorsk). Besides, climatotherapy, electrochromophototherapy, etc. are widely used. The health resort specialises in treatment of patients with diseases of digestion organs as well as those with metabolic disorder. Economy The town has food-processing enterprises (a cannery, a dairy factory, a brewery, a meat-processing plant, etc.), a knitting mill, a clothes and a shoe factory. Points of interest Balneotherapy facilities in Yessentuki (1915), fronted by statues of Asclepius and Hygieia The oldest architectural monument of Yessentuki is the wooden St. Nicholas' Church (built in the mid-1820s, presumably by the architects Giovanni and Giuseppe Bernardacci) in the centre of the former stanitsa. The orthogonal lay-out of the town, dating back to the middle of the 19th century, and a regular residential building-up of the second half of the 19th and the early 20th centuries, have been preserved here, in the southern end of Yessentuki. The resort area is to the north-east of the stanitsa part of Yessentuki. Its core is the extensive Kurortny (Glavny) Park (planted mostly with ash, oak, hornbeam, chestnut, maple, poplar, linden, etc., decorative bushes, flowers), laid in 1849, with springs of mineral water and numerous constructions: the building of the drinking gallery (1847‚Äì1856, architect S. Upton, Moresque style), the Nikolayevskiye (the present Verkhniye) baths (1899, architects N. V. Dmitriyev and B. V. Pravzdik), the Commercial gallery (1912, architect Y. F. Shreter, neo-classicism; the present Electroheliotherapy Institute), the wooden observation pavilion with colonnade referred to as Oreanda (1912), four pavilions above drinking well-rooms (1912‚Äì1913, architect N. N. Semyonov, neo-classicism), etc. The majority of sanatoriums and boarding houses are concentrated around Glavny Park. The area to the north of the Park (between the latter and the railway line) was developed since the end of the 19th century as a zone for private sanatoriums, villas (Orlinoye gnezdo, 1912‚Äì14, Art Nouveau), and resort constructions; the monumental building of the therapeutic mud bath in the spirit of ancient Roman thermae decorated with a mighty Ionic portico and numerous sculptures (1913‚Äì1915, architect Shreter, sculptors L. A. Ditrikh and Vasily Kozlov). In 1903, the Angliysky Park was laid out behind the railway line. The main area of modern industrial and residential building is the so-called Novye Yessentuki. Among the significant structures of the middle of the 20th century are four solemn entrances to the Kurortny Park (mid-1950s, architect P. P. Yeskov), the drinking gallery of spring No. 4 (1967, architect V. N. Fuklev), the Ukraina sanatorium (1972), etc. Climate The climate is moderately continental. Winter is mild, with thaws; the temperature in January averages to ; severe frosts sometimes take place; mists are frequent. Spring is short, sometimes the weather is cool, rainy (mostly in April). Summer is warm, with a large number of hot and dry days; the temperature in July averages to . Fall is warm and lasting; the temperature in September averages to about 15-20 ¬∞C. Precipitations of about a year. A large number of clear, sunny days (280 a year on average) is typical. The open position in the east and in the west makes Yessentuki accessible for winds prevailing here: dry eastern ones, which are hot in summer and cold in winter; and wet south-west ones, cool in summer and warm in winter. Notable people Fast growth of the Yessentuki health resort in the last third of the 19th and the early 20th centuries attracted famous representatives of Russian culture, including the writers Vladimir Korolenko, Aleksandr Kuprin, Maxim Gorky and Konstantin Balmont; the composers Sergei Taneyev, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Sergei Prokofiev; the singer Feodor Chaliapin; and the theatrical figures Maria Savina, Vera Komissarzhevskaya and Konstantin Stanislavsky.

She wrote three copies of the work. In 1968, friends typed samizdat copies, repeating the pictures on the back sides of the sheets. Excerpts from the work were first published in Ogonyok and Znamya magazines in 1990, as well as in The Observer (June 1990). After that, German and French publications followed. In 2001 the complete text, in six volumes, was published in Russia.  Biography  Eufrosinia Kersnovskaya was born in Odessa to a family of Russian gentry. During the Russian Civil War the family moved to their estate in Bessarabia to become farmers. Bessarabia was soon united with Romania. In 1940, Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union, and the Kersnovskaya family (Eufrosinia and her mother) were oppressed as former landowners. In 1941 she was exiled to Siberia as an exile settler (—Å—Å—ã–ª—å–Ω–æ–ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–µ—Ü) to work as a logger. In 1942 she attempted to escape, but was recaptured and sentenced to death. She refused to ask for clemency and wrote on a sheet of paper provided to her for this purpose: \\"I cannot demand justice, I do not want to ask for mercy\\". Kernovskaya's death sentence was nevertheless commuted to 10 years of labor camps, which she spent in the Norillag (–ù–æ—Ä–∏–ª—å–ª–∞–≥, Norilsk labor camp) at mining works. After the discharge in 1953 she lived in Yessentuki and wrote her memoirs during 1964‚Äì1968, which were published only in 1990. Her memoirs are illustrated by hundreds of drawings of life in the Gulag. They are also remarkable for the quality of the drawings.

Vesaas is widely considered to be one of Norway's greatest writers of the twentieth century and perhaps its most important since World War II. Biography Vesaas was born in Vinje, Telemark, Norway. He was the oldest of three sons. He was guilt-ridden by his refusal to take over the family farm, and this guilt permeates much of his authorship. He spent much of his youth in solitude, seeking comfort and solace in nature. The destruction he witnessed after World War I also made a deep impression on him. He married the writer Halldis Moren Vesaas and moved to Midtb√∏ in his home district of Vinje in 1934. His authorship covers almost 50 years, from 1923 to 1970. Written in Nynorsk, his work is characterized by simple, terse, and symbolic prose. His stories are often about simple rural people that undergo a severe psychological drama and who according to critics are described with immense psychological insight. Commonly dealing with themes such as death, guilt, angst, and other deep and intractable human emotions, the Norwegian natural landscape is a prevalent feature in his works. His debut was in 1923 with Children of Humans (Menneskebonn), but he had his breakthrough in 1934 with The Great Cycle (Det store spelet). His mastery of the nynorsk language, landsm√•l (see Norwegian language), has contributed to its acceptance as a medium of world class literature. A prolific author, he won a number of awards, including the Gyldendal's Endowment in 1943 and Dobloug Prize in 1957. He was awarded the Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1963 for his novel The Ice Palace and the Venice Prize in 1953 for The Winds. He was mentioned as being considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature on three separate occasions (1964, 1968 and 1969). The most famous of his works are The Ice Palace (Is-slottet), a story of two girls who build a profoundly strong relationship, and The Birds (Fuglane), a story of an adult of a simple childish mind, which through his tenderhearted empathy and imagination bears the role of a seer or writer. His novels have been translated into 28 languages. Several of his books have been translated into English ‚Äì many of them published by Peter Owen Publishers‚Äì among them Spring Night, The Birds, Through Naked Branches, and The Ice Palace.

This article is a list of schools currently or historically associated with the Society of Friends, regardless of their current degree of affiliation. Friends schools vary greatly, both in their interpretation of Quaker principles and in how they relate to formal organizations that make up the Society of Friends. Most Friends schools are similar in their mission however: to provide an academically sound education while also instilling values of community, spirituality, responsibility and stewardship in their students. Some institutions founded by Friends were never formally \\"Quaker schools.\\" Some historically Friends institutions are no longer formally associated with the Society of Friends. Those that continue to call themselves \\"Quaker schools\\" may have formal oversight from a Friends yearly or monthly meetings (often called coming \\"under care of\\" a meeting), and others are governed by members of the Society of Friends and/or adhere to aspects of Quaker practice.

It is the adopted son of Godzilla, and is sometimes referenced as Minya in the American dubbed versions. Overview Introduced in Son of Godzilla, Minilla was born on Sollgel Island, when its egg was prematurely cracked open by a group of mutant giant mantises called Kamacuras. Godzilla soon arrived, killed two of the Kamacuras, and rescued Minilla. Godzilla proceeded to train Minilla and defended it against further attacks from the final Kamacuras and the giant spider Kumonga. Godzilla and Minilla were placed in hibernation when a group of scientists completed a weather experiment, resulting in the freezing of their island. The monsters were revived when the snow melted, and eventually relocated to Monster Island, as seen via stock footage in Godzilla vs. Gigan. In Destroy All Monsters, Minilla, Godzilla, and many other Earth monsters live on a new island called Monsterland. Together they battle the three-headed space dragon King Ghidorah at Mount Fuji. They kill Ghidorah and save planet Earth. After, Minilla and the other monsters return to Monsterland. In Godzilla: Final Wars, Minilla convinces his father not to attack the crew of the Gotengo before leaving with Godzilla into the ocean. Development According to director Jun Fukuda, Minilla's creation was not an attempt at appealing to child audiences, but was merely a new approach for the series.David Milner, \\"Jun Fukuda Interview\\", Kaiju Conversations (July 1994) After filming Ebirah, Horror of the Deep, Godzilla creator Tomoyuki Tanaka reportedly approached screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa and suggested the idea of giving Godzilla a son to commemorate the New Year. According to Godzilla historian Steve Ryfle, the character's creation was likely a response to the contemporary light-hearted Gamera films.

History The idea to combine educational activities in a joint Chinese-German university college for postgraduate studies dates back to the visit of former German chancellor Dr. Helmut Kohl in November 1993. Negotiations between China and Germany started in 1994, and in the following year the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) was assigned the realization of this project. The Shanghai \\"Chinesisch-Deutsches Hochschulkolleg\\" or CDHK, as the college for postgraduate studies is called for short, was finally opened in February 1998. On October 7, 2002, the college moved into new modern building in Chifeng Lu. Objectives As an institute at Tongji University, the CDHK today offers bilingual master studies in the following fields: *electrical engineering (automation, information technology) *mechanical engineering (production engineering, automotive engineering) *economics (supply chain management, marketing, financial management, economic law, actuarial science) According to German educational standards, the curriculum is oriented towards broad knowledge and practical experience. Thus, the CDHK is able to train junior staff with both leadership qualities and experience in two cultures for the benefit of Chinese and German companies in China. Course of studies The postgraduate studies at CDHK take three years and start with intensive German language training in the first semester. From the second to the third semester students proceed their language studies in addition to their respective field studies and will attend a language test. As an end of the German language training course, all the students are obliged to take a middle-level German test and received a German language certificate issued by German College of Tongji University. The students attend classes of Chinese professors who themselves have studied in Germany for a considerable time or finished their PhD at a German university. Moreover, each semester CDHK invites German tutors for one or two weeks to hold German language lectures in their respective fields. Basically all the courses are co-conducted by Chinese and German Professors. Double Masters Program In the fourth semester students have the chance to go to Germany for an internship in a company and/or study at one of its partner universities. In the later case, students must have passed TestDAF, a German language test, with at least a score of 16(on a 20 scale). In electro technics there even is the chance to prepare for an international final degree at the Technical University of Munich, the so-called \\"double master\\" program. In the year of 2008, this \\"double master \\" program was extended to the students of mechanical engineering with the partner university of Ruhr-University Bochum This program is sponsored partially by DAAD. Several graduates already work on their PhD either in Germany or China. Perspectives The Chinese-German College for Postgraduate Studies is sponsored by Tongji-University and the DAAD as well as by numerous companies that have among others donated eighteen chairs and support the project by presentation, visits and contacts. It is the first educational joint-venture of this dimension, enjoying the support of both governments, and has the advantage of the close cooperation with its entrepreneurial sponsors.

He is the author of Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, and several dozen other novels for adults and children. Many of Maguire's adult novels are inspired by classic children's stories; Wicked transforms the Wicked Witch of the West from L. Frank Baum's 1900 book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its 1939 film adaptation into the misunderstood green-skinned Elphaba Thropp. The blockbuster 2003 Broadway musical Wicked was inspired by Maguire's first novel for adults. Written by Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman, the musical is currently Broadway's fifth longest-running show (surpassing Les Mis√©rables on October 28, 2019), and at its peak nine companies ran simultaneously around the world.

Both countries had supported each other in the Soviet‚ÄìAlbanian and Sino-Soviet splits, together declaring the necessity of defending Marxism‚ÄìLeninism against what they regarded as Soviet revisionism within the international communist movement. By the early 1970s, however, Albanian disagreements with certain aspects of Chinese policy deepened as the visit of Nixon to China along with the Chinese announcement of the \\"Three Worlds Theory\\" produced strong apprehension in Albania's leadership under Enver Hoxha. Hoxha saw in these events an emerging Chinese alliance with American imperialism and abandonment of proletarian internationalism. In 1978, China broke off its trade relations with Albania, signalling an end to the informal alliance which existed between the two states. Origins The Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, pictured in 1971 In September 1956, Enver Hoxha headed a delegation of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania (PLA) at the Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of China. Writing years later of his impressions of the country before the visit, he noted that: Khrushchev's rehabilitation of Tito and Yugoslavia and his \\"Secret Speech\\" in February 1956 put the Soviet leadership at odds with its Albanian counterpart. According to the Albanians, the \\"Khrushchev group's approaches to the Yugoslav revisionists and its open denigration of Joseph Stalin were the first open distortions of an ideological and political character, which were opposed by the PLA.\\" After arriving in Beijing on September 13, Hoxha held his first (and only) meeting with Mao Zedong in between sessions of the party's congress. Mao's first two questions concerned Yugoslav-Albanian ties and the Albanians' opinion on Stalin. Hoxha replied that Albania's relations with Yugoslavia were \\"cold\\" and he gave Mao \\"a brief outline, dwelling on some of the key moments of the anti-Albanian and anti-Marxist activity of the Yugoslav leadership.\\" On the subject of Stalin, Hoxha stated that the Party of Labour considered him \\"a leader of very great, all-round merits, a loyal disciple of Lenin and continuer of his work.\\" Mao argued that the 1948 Information Bureau decision to expel Yugoslavia was incorrect, and also stressed what he considered to have been Stalin's mistakes in regard to China. Hoxha later recalled that \\"our impressions from this meeting were not what we had expected... We were especially disappointed over the things we heard from the mouth of Mao about the Information Bureau, Stalin and the Yugoslav question. However, we were even more surprised and worried by the proceedings of the 8th Congress. The whole platform of this Congress was based on the theses of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, indeed, in certain directions, the theses of Khrushchev had been carried further forward... Apart from other things, in the reports which Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Zhou Enlai delivered one after the other at the 8th Congress they defended and further deepened the permanent line of the Communist Party of China for extensive collaboration with the bourgeoisie and the kulaks, 'argued' in support of the great blessings which would come to 'socialism' from treating capitalists, merchants, and bourgeois intellectuals well and placing them in high leading positions, vigorously propagated the necessity of collaboration between the working class and the national bourgeoisie, and between the communist party and the other democratic nationalist parties, in the conditions of socialism, etc., etc. In fact, the 'hundred flowers' and the 'hundred schools' of Mao Zedong... constituted the Chinese variant of the bourgeois-revisionist theory and practice about the 'free circulation of ideas and people', about the coexistence of a hotch-potch of ideologies, trends, schools and coteries within socialism.\\" According to Hoxha, Mao at the 1957 International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties declared that, \\"If Stalin were here, we would find it difficult to speak like this. When I met Stalin, before him I felt like a pupil in front of his teacher, while with Comrade Khrushchev we speak freely like equal comrades\\" and condemned the \\"Anti-Party Group\\" of Molotov and others. Hoxha also claimed that Mao expressed regret that the Yugoslavs refused to attend the conference, with Mao speaking of those \\"who are 100 per cent Marxists, and others who are 80 per cent, 70 per cent or 50 per cent, indeed there are some who may be only 10 per cent Marxists. We ought to talk even with those who are 10 per cent Marxists, because there are only advantages in this. Why should we not gather, two or three of us, in a small room and talk things over? Why should we not talk, proceeding from the desire for unity?\\" In Hoxha's view the refusal of the Yugoslavs to attend, as well as both Soviet and Chinese desires to enhance their prestige in the world communist movement in response to events over the previous year, produced a situation where \\"the 1957 Moscow Declaration [resulting from the Conference], in general, was a good document\\" owing to its emphasis on opposing revisionism, which both the Soviets and Chinese found advantageous to stress at the time. The Chinese leader Mao Zedong, pictured in 1963 According to William E. Griffith, the Chinese position on international affairs had begun to shift to the left owing to deepening contradictions with the Soviet Union and the failure of the Hundred Flowers Campaign at home. \\"Only when the Chinese decided, in 1957 and openly in 1960, to challenge Soviet domination of the [communist] bloc did they seriously look around for allies whom they were ready and willing to support.\\" By 1960 the Albanians found themselves in ideological agreement with the Chinese, as Elez Biberaj notes: \\"The Chinese had criticized Khrushchev for his rapprochement with Tito, and considered the toleration of Yugoslav 'revisionism' dangerous to the entire communist bloc... Although the seeds of the Sino-Soviet conflict were sown during Stalin's time, policy differences between Beijing and Moscow emerged during the mid- and the late 1950s, coinciding with the deterioration of Albanian-Soviet relations.\\" The Chinese found the Albanians useful owing to their hostility to perceived Soviet revisionism, with Albanian articles on the subject being reprinted in the Chinese media. In November 1960 the Second International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was to be held, and a Commission was created in October to prepare for it. The Albanian delegation headed by Hysni Kapo and the Chinese delegation headed by Deng Xiaoping, however, were at odds; Kapo's speech to the Commission criticized the Soviet handling of the Bucharest Conference and its attacks on China, whereas Deng stated that, \\"We are not going to speak about all the issues... We are not going to use such terms as 'opportunist', or 'revisionist', etc.\\" Neither Kapo nor Ramiz Alia (another member of the delegation) felt this stand was correct, with Hoxha sending letters to the delegation calling Deng's speeches \\"spineless\\" and further replying that, \\"They are not for carrying the matter through to the end... They are for mending what can be mended, and time will mend the rest... If I were in the Soviets' shoes, I would accept the field which the Chinese are opening to me, because there I will find good grass and can browse at will.\\" Alia thus wrote that on the subject of principles, \\"The Chinese were concerned only about the [Soviet] 'conductor's baton', which they wanted to break. They went no further.\\" Nonetheless, Hoxha recalled years later that, concerning the breakdown in relations between China and the Soviet Union, \\"we were quite clear that [the Soviets] did not proceed from principled positions in the accusations they were making against the Chinese party. As became even clearer later, the differences were over a series of matters of principle which, at that time, the Chinese seemed to maintain correct stands. Both in the official speeches of the Chinese leaders and in their published articles, especially in the one entitled 'Long Live Leninism', the Chinese party treated the problems in a theoretically correct way and opposed the Khrushchevites.\\" On this basis it defended the activity of the Communist Party of China at the Conference, \\"it did so in full consciousness in order to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and not to be given some factories and some tractors by China in return.\\" 1960s Enver Hoxha and Zhou Enlai in 1966 Griffith wrote in the early 60s that \\"Albanian documents are notable for their tone of extreme violence and defiance. A remarkable combination of traditional Balkan fury and left-wing Marxist-Leninist fanaticism, the Albanian anti-Khrushchev polemics... were certainly much more extreme than the relatively moderate, flowery, and above all 'correct' language in which the Chinese Communists have normally couched their most icy blasts against Moscow... It seems doubtful that Peking initiated or even necessarily approved the intensity and extent of the Albanian verbal violence... they quite possibly could not or did not feel it wise to restrain him.\\" One author noted that \\"Hoxha's speech [to the November 1960 Conference] so vehemently denounced Khrushchev that even the Chinese delegates looked embarrassed.\\" With both states claiming that the Soviet leadership had betrayed Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and was presiding over the restoration of capitalism in the USSR, \\"China came to be perceived as having replaced the Soviet Union as the leader of the 'anti-imperialist struggle.' This image was reinforced by the poor state of Beijing's relations with the capitalist countries in general. ... The revolutionary spirit characterizing the Chinese society was highly regarded by the Albanian leadership, and was considered as an indication of the Marxist-Leninist character of the CCP and its policies. During the formative years of the alliance, Tiran√´ looked to Beijing as a center for the development of a new and 'truly' Marxist-Leninist movement.\\" In 1964 Zhou Enlai visited Albania and signed a joint statement which, among other things, stated that, \\"Relations between socialist countries, big or small, economically more developed or less developed, must be based on the principles of complete equality... It is absolutely impermissible to impose the will of one country upon another, or to impair the independence, sovereignty and interests of the people, of a fraternal country on the pretext of 'aid' or 'international division of labor.'\\" The informal alliance between China and Albania was considered by Jon Halliday to be \\"one of the oddest phenomena of modern times: here were two states of vastly differing size, thousands of miles apart, with almost no cultural ties or knowledge of each other's society, drawn together by a common hostility to the Soviet Union.\\" Biberaj wrote that it was unusual, \\"a political rather than a military alliance\\" without any formal treaty having been signed and \\"lacking an organizational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination,\\" being \\"characterized by an informal relationship conducted on an ad hoc basis.\\" One early disagreement between the Chinese and Albanians concerned the character of the Soviet leadership and polemics against it. In July 1963 Hoxha wrote in his diary that, \\"The Chinese are saying about Khrushchev today what Khrushchev said about Tito yesterday: 'He is an enemy, a Trojan horse, but we must not let him go over to the enemy, must not let him capitulate, because there is the question of the peoples of Yugoslavia', etc.\\" and that \\"we are not dealing with a person or a group that is making some mistakes, that in the middle of the road sees the disaster looming up ahead and turns back; in this case it would be essential to manoeuvre, without giving way on principles, 'to prevent him from going over to the imperialists'. But with Khrushchev it is not at all in order, or correct, even to consider, let alone do such a thing. He has betrayed completely.\\" The Chinese were reluctant to engage in public polemics with the Soviet leadership in 1961‚Äì63, stressing the need for a \\"united front\\" against the Americans and accordingly asking the Albanians to tone down their own polemics and ask for the restoration of diplomatic relations from the Soviet Union, with the Albanians taking offense to such views. Another early disagreement between the Chinese and Albanians was over the subject of border disputes. Hoxha wrote in his diary in August 1964 that \\"Chou En-lai raises with the Rumanians territorial claims against the Soviet Union. He accuses the Soviet Union (Lenin and Stalin because, this 'robbery', according to Chou En-lai, took place in their time) of having seized Chinese, Japanese, Polish, German, Czech, Rumanian, Finnish, and other territories. On the other hand, Chou En- lai tells the Rumanians that they are doing well to claim the territories which the Soviet Union has seized from them. These are not Marxist-Leninist, but national-chauvinist positions. Regardless of whether or not mistakes may have been made, to raise these things now, when we are faced, first of all, with the ideological struggle against modern revisionism, means not to fight Khrushchev, but on the contrary to assist him on his chauvinist course.\\" In September that year the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania sent a letter to the CC of the CCP on the Sino-Soviet border dispute, stating that, \\"Under the pressure of Khrushchev's revisionist propaganda, under the influence of Khrushchev's slanders and calumnies, and for many other reasons, the masses of the Soviet people will not understand why People's China is now putting forth territorial claims to the Soviet Union, they will not accept this, and Soviet propaganda is working to make them revolt against you. But we think that even true Soviet communists will not understand it, nor will they accept it. This would be a colossal loss for our struggle.\\" The CC of the CCP did not reply. With the downfall of Khrushchev and rise of Leonid Brezhnev in October 1964 the Chinese called for the Party of Labour of Albania to join in supporting the new leadership \\"in the struggle against the common enemy, imperialism.\\" The Party of Labour felt that Brezhnev's rise merely represented \\"Khrushchevism without Khrushchev\\" and in a letter to the CC of the CCP urged the continuation of polemics against the Soviet leadership, whereas the Chinese sought to get the Albanians to send a delegation to Moscow together with their own delegation headed by Zhou Enlai. Recalling this incident in 1968 Hoxha wrote that, \\"Chou En-lai went to Moscow without us and there he suffered [an] ignominious defeat... Later we were told: 'We made a mistake in going to Moscow and in proposing it to you, too', etc., etc.\\" Regardless of these and future differences between the two informal allies, the Albanians subsequently wrote that they \\"supported China publicly... in the international arena for those stands of the Chinese side which were correct.\\" A constant irritant on the Albanian side was an inability to have regular contacts with the Chinese. Examining Hoxha's two-volume Reflections on China (consisting of extracts from his political diary), Halliday writes that, \\"If there is a central theme to the whole 1600 pages, it is the problem of deciphering China's actions... In the very first entry... Hoxha writes that in spite of the importance of consulting about 'revisionism', 'up to now, the Chinese have not had any contact at all with us to discuss these things. Were our enemies to know that between us there is no consultation at all about the fight against the modern revisionists, they would be astonished. They would never believe it. But that is how things stand.' ... Hoxha presents the decade and a half of 'alliance' with China as years when Albania had to muzzle itself quite a lot, with the occasional bust-out to signal disapproval of China's actions... The diary is rich in accounts of his attempts to decode both published statements and acts, on the one hand, and (something not so widely known) the private communications of the Chinese to the Albanians which were also in 'code'. In the end, Hoxha is reduced to watching the TV of his hated Yugoslavia and capitalist Italy.\\" In October 1966 Hoxha delivered a speech to a plenum of the CC of the Party of Labour titled \\"Some Preliminary Ideas about the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution,\\" noting that, \\"We have been informed about and have followed the recent developments in China only through the Chinese press and Hsinhua. The Communist Party of China and its Central Committee have not given our Party and its Central Committee any special comradely information. We think that as a party so closely linked with ours, it ought to have kept us better informed in an internationalist way, especially during these recent months.\\" Hoxha analyzed the events in China in an overall negative fashion, criticizing among other things the fact that the CCP had not held a congress in ten years and that four years had gone by without a plenum of the CC being called, a practice which \\"cannot be found in any Marxist-Leninist party.\\" Hoxha said that \\"the cult of Mao was raised to the skies in a sickening and artificial manner\\" and further added that, in reading of its purported objectives, \\"you have the impression that everything old in Chinese and world culture should be rejected without discrimination and a new culture, the culture they call proletarian, should be created.\\" He further stated that, \\"It is difficult for us to call this revolution, as the 'Red Guards' are carrying it out, a Proletarian Cultural Revolution... the enemies could and should be captured by the organs of the dictatorship on the basis of the law, and if the enemies have wormed their way into the party committees, let them be purged through party channels. Or in the final analysis, arm the working class and attack the committees, but not with children.\\" The beginning of the Chinese \\"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\\" coincided with the intensification of the Albanian \\"Ideological and Cultural Revolution\\" in the fields of culture, economics and politics, which unlike its Chinese counterpart was presented as \\"a continuation and deepening of policies, programs, and efforts undertaken by Albania over a period of some twenty years,\\" with other differences being that Hoxha's presence was never given \\"the symbolic and mystical stature in the Albanian revolution that Mao Tse-tung enjoyed in China,\\" there was no inner-party factional struggle at the root of Albanian initiative, the Albanian army played no significant role in events, and there were no Albanian equivalents to the Red Guards nor was there an \\"influx of supporters of the revolution from the provinces to Tiran√´... no public purges, no turmoil in the State University of Tiran√´ or dislocations of the school system, and no damaging blow to the economy as a result of changes brought on by the revolution.\\" The Albanians also resisted Chinese efforts to get them to praise \\"Mao Zedong Thought\\" as constituting a \\"higher stage\\" of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. Another difference between the Albanians and Chinese was on the treatment of \\"anti- revisionist\\" parties in Europe and elsewhere who openly upheld the positions of the Albanians and Chinese against the Soviet Union, with the Chinese being reluctant to organize them in joint endeavors due to fears of alienating \\"neutral\\" parties such as those in North Korea and North Vietnam, whereas the Albanians took an active interest in such efforts; Hoxha wrote that the CCP \\"is avoiding general meetings... It holds meetings with other parties, one at a time, which it is entitled to do, and after such meetings these parties come out with statements and articles which defend everything which China says and does. Now the entire concern of the Communist Party of China is that the Marxist-Leninist communist movement should accept that the ideas of Mao Tsetung lead the world, accept the cult of Mao, the Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the entire line of the Communist Party of China with its good points and its mistakes... Just as the opinions of one party cannot be accepted en bloc, neither can those of two parties be accepted en bloc. All must state their opinion. Therefore, the joint meeting and the taking of joint decisions is important.\\" Following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 an Albanian delegation to Beijing was told by Zhou Enlai that \\"Albania, as a small country, had no need of heavy armament and that it was not at all in a position to defend itself alone from foreign aggression... Therefore, according to Chou En-lai, the only road for Albania to cope with foreign aggression was that of... concluding a military alliance with Yugoslavia and with Rumania... [and he] repeated this same thesis to the Albanian Government delegation which had gone to Peking in July 1975... [which] was turned down again by our delegation in a clear-cut and categorical manner.\\" An indication of the Albanian position on Romania was shown by Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's visit to China in June 1971, with Hoxha writing in his diary that: \\"Hsinhua reported only that [Mao] said to him: 'Rumanian comrades, we should unite to bring down imperialism'. As if Ceausescu and company are to bring down imperialism!! If the world waits for the Ceausescus to do such a thing, imperialism will live for tens of thousands of years. It is the proletariat and the peoples that fight imperialism.\\" 1970s Following Lin Biao's downfall the Chinese leadership began seeking an accommodation with the United States against the Soviet Union, viewing the latter as a more dangerous opponent to its interests. Henry Kissinger's visit to China in July 1971 and the subsequent announcement of Nixon's visit came as a shock to the Albanians, with Hoxha writing in his diary at the time that \\"when the Americans were killing and bombing in Vietnam and the whole of Indochina, China held secret talks with the Americans... These disgraceful, anti-Marxist, uncomradely negotiations were held without the knowledge of the Vietnamese, let alone any knowledge on our part. This was scandalous. This was a betrayal of the Chinese towards the Vietnamese, towards their war, towards us, their allies, and all the other progressive peoples. This is revolting.\\" A month later the CC of the Party of Labour of Albania sent a letter to its Chinese counterpart strongly protesting the decision to receive Nixon, writing among other things that \\"regardless of the result of the talks, the very fact that Nixon, who is known as a rabid anti-communist, as an aggressor and murderer of peoples, as the representative of the blackest of American reaction, is to be received in China, has many minuses and will bring many negative consequences to the revolutionary movement and our cause. There is no way in which Nixon's visit to China and the talks with him can fail to create harmful illusions about American imperialism. ... It will exert a negative influence on the resistance and struggle of the American people themselves against the policy and aggressive activity of the government of Nixon, who will seize the opportunity to run for President again. ... It is not hard to guess what the Italian workers who clashed with the police and demonstrated their repugnance to Nixon's recent visit to Italy, the Japanese workers who did not allow Eisenhower even to set foot on their territory, and the peoples of Latin America who protested and rose against the Rockefellers and all the other envoys of the Washington government, will think. Only the Yugoslav Titoites and the Rumanian revisionists welcomed President Nixon to their capitals with flowers.\\" The CC of the CCP did not reply to the letter. In that year and in 1972, however, the Chinese did send messages notifying the Albanians that they should expect a lower level of economic activity with China in the future. In October 1971 Hoxha was informed that the Chinese would not be sending a delegation to the 6th Congress of the Party of Labour held next month, which prompted Hoxha to write that, \\"Every cloud has a silver lining. Reaction and the revisionists will make the most of this anti-Marxist action of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, but the international communist movement will judge how right our Party has been in its line and how wrong the Communist Party of China is on this question.\\" At the 6th Congress Hoxha indirectly criticized recent Chinese foreign policy moves by declaring that, \\"As long as American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist imperialism are two imperialist superpowers and come out with a common counter-revolutionary strategy, it is impossible for the struggle of the peoples against them not to merge into a single current. You cannot rely on the one imperialism to oppose the other.\\" In 1973 China's trade with Albania experienced a significant decline, to $136 million from $167 million a year earlier. Reflecting on China's relations with the Party of Labour at this point, Hoxha wrote that \\"Chou En-lai, Li Hsien- nien and Mao have cut off their contacts with us, and the contacts which they maintain are merely formal diplomatic ones. Albania is no longer the 'faithful, special friend'. For them it comes at the end of the line, after Rumania and Yugoslavia in Europe ... it is quite obvious that their 'initial ardour' has died.\\" In April the same year Geng Biao informed the Albanians that \\"China does not approve the creation of Marxist-Leninist parties and does not want the representatives of these parties to come to China. Their coming is a nuisance to us but we can do nothing about them, for we cannot send them away. We accept them just as we accept the representatives of bourgeois parties.\\" In 1974‚Äì75 various figures in Albanian military, economic and cultural fields were arrested, with some executed on charges of plotting a coup d'√©tat which would install a government favorable to greater ties with the West and which would promote economic and cultural liberalization on broadly Yugoslav lines. In his diary at the time Hoxha wrote that, \\"The Chinese make a friend of any state, any person, whether Trotskyite, Titoite, or a Chiang Kai-shek man, if he says, 'I am against the Soviets'. We are opposed to this principle... It is clear that the Chinese do not like these and other stands of ours, because they tear down the Marxist-Leninist disguise they want to maintain, therefore they are exerting pressure on us. This pressure is economic, because politically and ideologically they have never made us yield and will never be able to make us yield. ... Their pressure is not imaginary, but took concrete form in the military and economic plot headed by Beqir Balluku, Petrit Dume, Hito √áako, Abdyl K√´llezi, Ko√ßo Theodhosi, Lipe Nashi, etc.\\" In April 1974 Deng Xiaoping, head of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations, proclaimed the \\"Three Worlds Theory\\" at a speech to its General Assembly, which declared that the world was divided into \\"first\\" (the United States and the Soviet Union), \\"second\\" (France, Great Britain, West Germany, Japan, etc.), and \\"third\\" (the various countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia) worlds, of which China was declared to be in the third. Writing on such matters, Hoxha declared that, \\"When China took its pro- American and anti-Soviet stance, this policy was manifested in all its relations with the foreign world. Imperialist America, the fascists Pinochet and Franco, Tito and Ceausescu, renegades and adventurers, German revanchists and Italian fascists are its friends. For China ideology has no importance... The Chinese imagine (there is no other way their actions can be interpreted) that the whole world thinks and is convinced that China is red and revolutionary. This policy which China is pursuing has a 'revolutionary' aim: to unite the 'third world', the 'second world' and American imperialism against the Soviet social-imperialists. And from their actions it turns out that in order to achieve this 'ideal' they must not take much account of principles. 'We now defend the United States of America,' the Chinese justify themselves, 'because it is weaker than the Soviet Union, but with this we must also deepen the contradictions between the Soviet Union and the United States of America'. ... Having deviated from a principled Marxist-Leninist class policy, China, naturally, must base itself on the political conjunctures, on the manoeuvres and intrigues of reactionary governments.\\" In response to Albania's refusal to endorse the \\"Three Worlds Theory,\\" the rapprochement with the United States, and other activities, \\"Beijing had drastically reduced the flow of its economic and military assistance\\" to Albania by 1976, trade declining to $116 million in that year from $168 in 1975. Culmination At the 7th Congress of the Party of Labour, held in November 1976, Hoxha indicated his opposition to the new Chinese leadership that had taken over with the death of Mao Zedong in September by refusing to mention Hua Guofeng and openly denouncing Deng Xiaoping while calling for a multilateral meeting of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist parties. According to the Albanians in their 1978 letter to the Chinese, the latter had tried to pressure them to denounce those who were not part of the ruling group in China: \\"As we did not do this, it comes to the conclusion that we are partisans of Lin Piao and 'the gang of four'. It is wrong in both aspects. ... The Party of Labour of Albania never tramples on Marxist-Leninist principles, and has never been, nor will it ever be, anybody's tool.\\" The Congress also saw activity on the part of various delegations from \\"anti-revisionist\\" parties, 29 in all, of whom a number expressed definite preference for the Albanian line over its Chinese counterpart. Speaking at the Congress, Hoxha reiterated his declaration at the 6th Congress on opposing both superpowers equally, and also denounced the Common Market and NATO, both of which were looked upon favorably by China in its anti-Soviet strategy. \\"Loyal to the interests of the revolution, socialism, and the peoples,\\" Hoxha said, \\"our Party will support the proletariat and the peoples who are against the two superpowers and for their destruction, against the capitalist and revisionist bourgeoisie and for its overthrow.\\" In December the Albanians were given a Chinese note criticizing Hoxha's report to the Congress, with Hoxha deciding to have the CC of the Party of Labour give an official reply, stressing in it that \\"the PLA is an independent Marxist-Leninist party which formulates its own line itself, from the viewpoint of the Marxist-Leninist theory, on the basis of realistic analyses of the internal and external situation... it accepts criticism by sister Marxist-Leninist parties, and it will discuss many problems with them, and vice-versa, the PLA also has the same right towards other sister parties.\\" Hoxha also had the reply mention that various letters sent to the CC of the CCP by its Albanian counterpart never received replies, such as the letter on Nixon's decision to visit China. The new Albanian letter did not receive a reply. Around this time Hoxha began analyzing the works of Mao Zedong and the history of the Communist Party of China. As part of his examination of the then-recently released 1956 Mao speech \\"On the Ten Major Relationships\\" in late December, Hoxha wrote of the Sino-Soviet split that \\"Mao's aim was to help not Khrushchev but himself, so that China would become the main leader of the communist world... He wanted meetings, wanted social-democratic agreements because he himself was a social-democrat, an opportunist, a revisionist. But Mao could not extinguish the fire [against perceived Soviet revisionism] or the polemic, and seeing that he was unable to establish his hegemony, he changed his stand. Mao took a somewhat 'better' anti-Soviet stand, and here he appeared to be in accord with us who were fighting Khrushchevite revisionism consistently. But even at this time he had hopes of rapprochement with the Khrushchevite revisionists. ... Then, from the strategy of the fight on the two flanks he turned towards the United States of America.\\" Hoxha further wrote that: \\"Mao Tsetung accuses Stalin of left adventurism, of having exerted great pressure on China and the Communist Party of China. ... Glancing over all the main principles of Mao Tsetung's revisionist line, in regard to all those things which he raises against Stalin, we can say without reservation that Stalin was truly a great Marxist-Leninist who foresaw correctly where China was going, who long ago realized what the views of Mao Tsetung were, and saw that, in many directions, they were Titoite revisionist views, both on international policy and on internal policy, on the class struggle, on the dictatorship of the proletariat, on peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, etc.\\" In May 1977 a Chinese parliamentary delegation visited Romania and Yugoslavia, but not Albania, and referred to the Yugoslav system as socialist while praising the Non-Aligned Movement, while Tito was invited to Beijing in August and praised by his hosts. In September 1978 Tito declared that, according to Hua, \\"Mao Zedong said that he should have invited me for a visit, stressing that in 1948, too, Yugoslavia was in the right, a thing which he had declared even then, to a narrow circle. But, taking into consideration the relations between China and the Soviet Union at that time, this was not said publicly.\\" On July 7, 1977 an editorial in Z√´ri i Popullit written but not signed by Hoxha and entitled \\"The Theory and Practice of the Revolution\\" openly attacked the \\"Three Worlds Theory\\" by name and thus signified a direct attack on the Chinese. Among other things the editorial stated that, \\"The Marxist-Leninists do not confuse the fervent liberation, revolutionary and socialist aspirations and desires of the peoples and the proletariat of the countries of the so-called 'third world' with the aims and policy of the oppressive compradore bourgeoisie of those countries ... to speak in general terms about the so-called 'third world' as the main force of the struggle against imperialism ... means a flagrant departure from the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and to preach typically opportunist views ... according to the theory of the 'three worlds', the peoples of those countries must not fight, for instance, against the bloody fascist dictatorships of Geisel in Brazil and Pinochet in Chile, Suharto in Indonesia, the Shah of Iran or the King of Jordan, etc., because they, allegedly, are part of the 'revolutionary motive force which is driving the wheel of world history forward'. On the contrary, according to this theory, the peoples and revolutionaries ought to unite with the reactionary forces and regimes of the 'third world' and support them, in other words, give up the revolution.\\" Furthermore, \\"The supporters of the theory of 'three worlds' claim that it gives great possibilities for exploitation of inter-imperialist contradictions. The contradictions in the enemy camp should be exploited, but in what way and for what aim? ... The absolutisation of inter-imperialist contradictions and the underestimation of the basic contradiction, that between the revolution and the counter-revolution ... are in total opposition to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism.\\" And, \\"This is an anti-revolutionary 'theory' because it preaches social peace, collaboration with the bourgeoisie, hence giving up the revolution, to the proletariat of Europe, Japan, Canada, etc. ... it justifies and supports the neo-colonialist and exploiting policy of the imperialist powers of the 'second world' and calls on the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America not to oppose this policy, allegedly for the sake of the struggle against the superpowers.\\" Hoxha wrote on the occasion of the editorial's publication that, \\"The Chinese did not make the slightest effort to defend their notorious theses about the revolution, because in fact there was no way in which they could defend them, because the division into three worlds and the inclusion of China in the 'third world', is nothing but an effort to extinguish the proletarian revolution and make the proletariat submit to the yoke of the capitalist bourgeoisie of the industrialized countries and of American imperialism. This absurd anti-Marxist theory allegedly combated Soviet social-imperialism which was endangering American imperialism, Chinese social-imperialism and the developed capitalist countries. The Chinese theories, which have their source in the bourgeois- revisionist views of Mao Tsetung, Chou En-lai, Teng Hsiao-ping and Chairman Hua, take no account at all of the peoples and the revolution.\\" The Chinese temporarily revived their interest in the pro-Chinese parties in order to use them as polemicists against attacks on the \\"Three Worlds Theory\\" while pro- Albanian parties fought back; on November 1 People's Daily dedicated its entire issue that day to an article entitled \\"Chairman Mao's Theory of the Differentiation of the Three Worlds Is A Major Contribution to Marxism- Leninism\\" in recognition that China could no longer rely entirely on proxies in defending its foreign policy from the Albanians. In December 1977 Hoxha recorded in his diary that a group of Chinese specialists were not being sent to Albania because in their excuse \\"the appropriate conditions do not exist, therefore as long as good conditions and understanding have not been created, we are not going to send our specialists for these objects.\\" In April and May 1978 the Albanian Foreign Ministry made an official complaint that Chinese experts in the country \\"had the deliberate intention of harming Albania's economy\\" and on July 7 that year, on the first anniversary of the publication of \\"The Theory and Practice of the Revolution,\\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the Albanian embassy in Beijing that it was ceasing all economic and military agreements with the country. On July 29 the Albanians replied, declaring the July 7 decision \\"a reactionary act from great power positions, an act which is a repetition, in content and form, of the savage and chauvinist methods of Tito, Khrushchev and Brezhnev which China, also, once condemned. The Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian Government reject the attempts made in the Chinese note to blame Albania, to groundlessly accuse the Albanian leadership of allegedly being ungrateful for China's aid and of allegedly having tried to sabotage the economic and military cooperation between the two countries. To any normal person it is unbelievable and preposterous that Albania, a small country, which is fighting against the imperialist-revisionist encirclement and blockade and which has set to large-scale and all-round work for the rapid economic and cultural development of its country, which is working tirelessly for the strengthening of the defence capacity of its socialist Homeland, should cause and seek cessation of economic cooperation with China, refuse its civil and military loans and aid.\\" The letter went on to note delays on the Chinese side in providing equipment and materials for the vast majority of its economic projects in Albania, but also concluded that, \\"The true motives for the cessation of aid and loans to Albania have not an exclusively technical character, as the note of the Chinese Government makes out, on the contrary they have a deep political and ideological character.\\" The letter concluded that, \\"Albania will never submit to anybody, it will stand to the end loyal to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It will march non-stop on the road of socialism and communism illuminated by the immortal teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin. ... Though encircled, socialist Albania is not isolated because it enjoys the respect and love of the world proletariat, the freedom-loving peoples and the honest men and women throughout the world. This respect and love will grow even more in the future. Our cause is just! Socialist Albania will triumph!\\" Subsequent developments Following the split with China, the Albanians proclaimed that their country was the only one in the world genuinely constructing a socialist society. In December 1977 Hoxha wrote an analysis of the Chinese revolution, declaring that, contrary to the Chinese view, \\"in general, the decisions and directives of the Comintern, first of all of the time of Lenin, were correct, and that those of the time of Stalin were correct, too.\\" On the character of the revolution he wrote that, \\"In my opinion, and as far as I can judge, China carried out a bourgeois- democratic revolution of a new type through the national liberation armed struggle\\" and that \\"the revolution in China could not be carried through to the end. ... So long as the working class in China shared power with the bourgeoisie, this power, in essence, was never transformed into a dictatorship of the proletariat, and consequently the Chinese revolution could not be a socialist revolution.\\" Biberaj writes that throughout the alliance the Albanians had a definite advantage in that \\"the scope of China's decision- making participation in Albania was insignificant ... it was the Albanians rather than the Chinese who decided on the use of the aid... Tiran√´ was in a stronger bargaining position than Beijing because the Chinese were more keen in maintaining the alliance.\\" Peter R. Prifti noted that Albania's relations with China \\"emphasize[d] once again the great importance the Albanian leaders attach to ideology ... [and] proved conclusively‚Äîif such proof were needed‚ÄîAlbania's independence of China. It demonstrated that the Albanian Party was not a mere mouthpiece of Peking but follows a basically independent foreign policy.\\" Recalling his pre-1956 impressions of China, Hoxha once wrote that, \\"It was said that Mao was following an 'interesting' line for the construction of socialism in China, collaborating with the local bourgeoisie and other parties, which they described as 'democratic', 'of the industrialists', etc., that joint private-state enterprises were permitted and stimulated by the communist party there, that elements of the wealthy classes were encouraged and rewarded, and even placed in the leadership of enterprises and provinces, etc., etc. All these things were quite incomprehensible to us and however much you racked your brains, you could not find any argument to describe them as in conformity with Marxism-Leninism. Nevertheless, we thought, China was a very big country, with a population of hundreds of millions, it had just emerged from the dark, feudal-bourgeois past, had many problems and difficulties, and in time it would correct those things which were not in order, on the right road of Marxism-Leninism.\\" Likewise in September 1977 Hoxha wrote that, \\"The question of Chinese communism has been an enigma to me. I am not saying this only now, but have expressed my doubt years ago in my notes. This doubt arose in my mind immediately after the Bucharest Meeting, and it was aroused because of the timorous stand the Chinese adopted there. ... Khrushchev's activity compelled Teng to change [his conciliatory] report and make it somewhat more severe, because Khrushchev issued a document in which China was attacked, and distributed it before the meeting. Teng was also compelled by the resolute stand of our Party, but that is a long story. The later stands of the Chinese, I am speaking about their political and ideological stands, have shown continuous vacillation, and this was precisely the basis of the enigma and my doubt about them ... but now we can say that this policy of China was a great fraud, a major manoeuvre of the Chinese revisionists to disguise themselves.\\" In the view of the Albanians, the shift in China's line between 1956 and 1960 was due to the following: \\"After the death of Stalin, the Chinese, with Mao Zedong at the head, thought that their time had come ... they wanted to gain as much as they could from Soviet economic aid, in order to become a great power, indeed, an atomic power. But these projects could not be carried out smoothly. If Mao Zedong had his hegemonistic ambitions, Khrushchev and his associates had their expansionist plans, too. ... While making most of what benefit they could get from the Chinese, at the same time Khrushchev and his associates began to be 'cautious' and 'restrained' in their support and aid for them. They did not want China to grow strong, economically or militarily. ... The policy of rapprochement with American imperialism, which Khrushchev was pursuing, likewise, was incompatible with the interests of the Chinese, because that would leave China out of the game of great powers. In this situation, seeing that Khrushchev's line had caused concern in the communist movement, the Communist Party of China seized the opportunity ... seized the 'banner' of defence of the principles of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. ... Undoubtedly, not to compel Khrushchev to abandon his course of betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, but to have him accept the hegemony of China and join it in its plans.\\" As Hoxha put it, \\"when Mao Zedong and his associates saw that they would not easily emerge triumphant over the patriarch of modern revisionism, Khrushchev, through the revisionist contest, they changed their tactic, pretended to reject their former flag, presented themselves as 'pure Marxist-Leninists', striving in this way, to win those positions which they had been unable to win with their former tactic. When this second tactic turned out no good, either, they 'discarded' their second, allegedly Marxist-Leninist, flag and came out in the arena as they had always been, opportunists, loyal champions of a line of conciliation and capitulation towards capital and reaction. We were to see all these things confirmed in practice, through a long, difficult and glorious struggle which our Party waged in defence of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism.\\" In December 1978 Hoxha's ' was released, the second half of which was a criticism of the \\"Three Worlds Theory,\\" Chinese foreign policy in general, and Maoism. Hoxha declared that China had become a \\"social-imperialist\\" country, aspiring to superpower status alongside the USA and USSR by tactically allying with the former against the latter on account of the former's greater economic strength and willingness to invest in the Chinese economy. On the subject of Maoism Hoxha stated that \\"Mao Zedong was not a Marxist-Leninist, but a progressive revolutionary democrat, who remained for a long time at the head of the Communist Party of China and played an important role in the triumph of the Chinese democratic anti-imperialist revolution. Within China, in the ranks of the party, among the people and outside China, he built up his reputation as a great Marxist-Leninist and he himself posed as a communist, as a Marxist- Leninist dialectician.

Biography Batya Gur was born in Tel Aviv in 1947 to parents who survived the Holocaust. She earned a master's degree in Hebrew literature from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Between 1971 and 1975 Batya lived in Greensboro, NC, where she taught Hebrew and Jewish studies to elementary students at the North Carolina Hebrew Academy at Greensboro (now called B'nai Shalom Day School).

Five sequels ensued. The first book was adapted as a film for Israeli television. In every book in the series Michael Ohayon enters a closed world, an isolated society, with rules of its own (for example psychoanalysts, literary scholars in academia, or members of a kibbutz). By his fundamental approach and his inner understanding of human nature, Ohayon succeeds in breaking the ring of silence and solving the murder mystery on his way to the next book.

It was produced by ABC Television for three series, and Thames Television for a further four. The series depicted the cases and investigations handled by the enquiry agent Frank Marker (Alfred Burke), an unmarried loner who is in his early forties when the series begins. The title is a twist on the more usual \\"private eye\\". Background The series was created by writers Roger Marshall and Anthony Marriott with the aim of getting away from \\"square-jawed\\" heroes of the type featured in Hollywood movies‚Äîa wish shared by Alfred Burke, the actor chosen to play Marker. This aim allowed for flexibility in the structure and plot lines of the episodes; each individual episode usually dealt with an individual case for Marker, but story arcs spanning several episodes, or in one case an entire series, were produced during the life of the programme. Marker's work ranged broadly, from routine matters such as gathering evidence for divorces (at a time when British law required evidence of infidelity or other compelling reason for annulling a marriage) or creditworthiness enquiries, to more exotic investigations such as tracing missing people (or in one case, a prize-winning whippet). Many of the narratives conclude with Marker leaving a situation as it was at the beginning of the episode‚Äîfor example, in \\"The Man Who Didn't Eat Sweets\\", he fails to tell his client that she is one of her husband's three wives. Episodes produced by ABC Television 1965‚Äì1968 The first episode of the series was broadcast (in black and white) in January 1965 and was set in London, although very little (if any) location work was actually performed and the episodes were mostly confined to the TV studio. Of the 41 episodes produced by ABC, only five are currently known to exist in television- broadcastable format‚Äîthe rest being victims of the common television company policy of wiping. However, two episodes from the first series remain. In \\"Nobody Kills Santa Claus\\", the second episode of the first series (transmitted 30 January 1965), Marker plays comparatively little part in the plot. The episode does establish key aspects of Marker's character: his modest lifestyle arising from his modest fees for his work‚Äîthe oft-quoted \\"six guineas a day plus expenses\\" (which became ¬£6.30 a day in the later Thames- produced episodes, once Britain converted to decimal currency)‚Äîhis shabby office, and the fact that he is often compelled to take on almost any offer of work just to earn his living. The plot concerns Marker being hired to protect a rather unlikeable businessman, Carson, who is receiving death threats. In keeping with the series' ethos of downplaying physical violence, Marker insists on being employed as a chauffeur rather than a bodyguard. He ends up taking a physical beating for his unlikeable client‚Äîa beating that is mostly off-screen and one that the viewer only sees the results of. The episode ends with Marker refusing an offer of permanent employment by Carson and returning to his freelance ways. Marker's work of necessity often involved him with the police and the criminal underworld‚Äîboth factions dislike him but, although they have some need for him, make his life difficult. The other surviving series 1 episode, \\"The Morning Wasn't So Hot\\", sees Marker cross paths with an organised criminal gang; he is thrown into the River Thames by underworld figures as \\"persuasion\\" to drop his enquiries into the whereabouts of a missing girl he has been hired to trace‚Äîshe has been forced into a life of professional vice at the behest of the gang. Partly as a result of this, the beginning of the second series he decides to leave London and moves to England's second city of Birmingham. Things do not improve, and he continues to be mixed up in a world of shadowy figures. The ABC episodes ended with \\"Cross That Palm When We Come To It\\" (broadcast on 13 April 1968) as Marker acts for a solicitor over some stolen jewels, as a go-between with the gang who stole them and want the reward money. Taking the recovered jewels back to his office, Marker receives a visit from the police and is convicted of receiving stolen property‚Äîthe solicitor who hired him was crooked and has disappeared. Marker pleads guilty to the charge and is sentenced to two-and-a- half years in prison. \\"Cross That Palm\\" is not one of the five surviving ABC episodes. It did however provide the basis for a 1974 novelisation by Audley Southcott (Sphere Books, ). Episodes produced by Thames Television 1969‚Äì1975 Big changes had occurred in the ITV franchises in Britain in 1968, and ABC had been forced to merge with rival company Rediffusion London to create what became one of the powerhouses of UK television production‚ÄîThames Television. Thames picked up the series again in 1969 and produced 46 more episodes; unlike their ABC precursors all 46 remain safely in the archives, although 11 of these were still produced and broadcast in black and white. One other was made in colour (but broadcast in black and white) as a test of Thames's new colour equipment, which was first used for broadcasting from November 1969‚Äîtwo months after the fourth series of Public Eye finished its on-air run. ABC's audience research had shown that many viewers found the character of Marker as interesting as his cases. For this reason, the first Thames series is quite different in style from the other three, and was written entirely by Public Eye co-creator Roger Marshall. Commonly referred to as 'the Brighton series', the collection of seven episodes links together to tell the story of Marker's release from prison and his gradual rehabilitation into everyday life, culminating in him renting a new office and starting up again as an enquiry agent. This series also introduces regular characters such as Marker's probation officer Mr Hull and his landlady Mrs Mortimer ‚Äî the first such characters in the series apart from Marker himself. The Brighton episodes The first episode of the fourth series, \\"Welcome to Brighton?\\" (broadcast 30 July 1969) starts with a custom title sequence giving a brief recap of Marker's offence and his prison career. The first shot is of Marker lying awake in bed with the judge's voice going through his head, passing sentence on him. It is about a year since the events of \\"Cross That Palm When We Come To It\\" and Marker has been transferred to an open prison before being released on parole to complete his sentence. He is determined not to fall into a life of crime, despite what his fellow prisoners tell him (\\"You've crossed over the line now, mate ‚Äî you're not one of them, you're one of us!\\"). In the first half of the episode, Marker is released from prison and heads for Brighton where the parole system has arranged accommodation for him with a Mrs Mortimer (Pauline Delaney). Through an extensive location-shot sequence on the sea front at Brighton, the viewer experiences Marker's disorientation at a world which appears to have changed considerably since he was sent to prison. He immediately encounters the very same sort of people with whom he dealt every day in his pre-prison life; a semi-drunken encounter with a woman who tries to steal his money and using his detective skills to trace the wife of a fellow inmate from the prison he has just been released from. Marker meets his parole officer, Mr Hull (played by John Grieve) and gets a job with a local builder, Mr Kendrick. In the third episode of the series, \\"Paid in Full\\", a colleague at Kendrick's yard has his pay packet stolen (workers in Britain were still paid in cash, rather than by cheque or bank transfer, in the late 1960s). Although completely innocent of any wrongdoing (as he points out, he would be stupid to steal the money as it would immediately end his parole and send him back to prison) Marker is placed under immense pressure by Kendrick's other employees once they find out he is an ex-prisoner. The episode ends with Marker reluctantly agreeing to give up the job at Kendrick's, and graphically illustrates the problems faced by ex-convicts as they try to reintegrate themselves with society. \\"Paid in Full\\" also contains a scene where Marker visits an antiques shop in Brighton to enjoy his newfound freedom to purchase something with the money he is earning. A conversation ensues with the old lady who owns the shop, wherein Marker explains some of his family history. The fourth episode in the Brighton series, \\"My Life's My Own\\", is a direct sequel to the Armchair Theatre play Wednesday's Child, though the role of Shirley is played by Stephanie Beacham in Public Eye and Prunella Ransome in the earlier Armchair Theatre episode (the other two overlapping roles are played by the same actors, however). This episode is also notable for an early television treatment of a lesbian relationship.Cathode Ray Tube Review ‚Äì Armchair Theatre Volume Two'My Life's My Own' BFI Entry The Brighton series sees Marker establish a platonic friendship with Mrs Mortimer. Although he is told that she is a widow, she later confides in him that she has a husband who left her, and who she presumes is still alive. She tells the probation service she is a widow because she feels it would be more socially acceptable for a widow to be seen to take in ex-prisoners as lodgers‚Äîan interesting comment on the social attitudes of late-1960s England. Towards the end of the series, Marker works briefly for another enquiry agent, Rylands‚Äîin \\"The Comedian's Graveyard\\" he is hired to trace a young girl who has run away from her home and is now appearing in a run-down end-of-pier theatre act. Unthinkably for the character during the ABC episodes, he invites Mrs Mortimer out for an evening at the theatre, together with the girl's aunt who has hired him. The partnership with Rylands soon splits up as Marker finds his working methods intolerable and makes it clear he thinks Rylands is less than honest with his clients. The final episode of the Brighton series was \\"A Fixed Address\\", broadcast (in monochrome) on 10 September 1969‚Äîalthough it was actually made in colour, as noted above. The series afforded a great deal of character development to secondary characters. Mrs Mortimer's estranged husband turns up on her doorstep claiming that he wants to restart their relationship. It transpires that his employers have offered him a lucrative post in an exotic overseas location‚Äîbut only if he is a married man accompanied by his wife. The episode is notable for Marker setting up on his own again as an enquiry agent. The end credits are played over shots of him admiring his new (but still run- down and dingy) office. The end credits returned to the original theme music of previous series rather than the barer, more static arrangement that had been used especially for the Brighton episodes. The Eton episodes Thames commissioned a further series, this time of thirteen episodes, and the fifth series began on 5 July 1971. Several ITV companies in the early 1970s faced strike action as unions demanded better wages for handling the more complex colour broadcasting equipment. As a result, the first five episodes of series five were made in black and white although they were juggled around for transmission so that all five were not shown together. The series opened with \\"A Mug Named Frank\\"; some months have passed since \\"A Fixed Address\\" and Marker is still living with Mrs Mortimer. She comments to him that his old problems are still present in Brighton‚Äîthe police all know of him and of his record of being in prison. She also points out that, by his own admission, life has not been easy for Marker since he set up office on his own again and that he isn't getting much work. A chance encounter in a supermarket ultimately results in Marker making the decision to move to Eton. To emphasise this, the opening titles to the episode are those used for the Brighton series, whereas the closing credits play over a film of Marker walking around Windsor and Eton, as used for the rest of the series. The episode also introduces the new regular character of Detective Inspector Percy Firbank (played by Ray Smith)‚Äîa local police officer whose interest is piqued by Marker. The remaining 12 episodes of series 5 often explore the Marker-Firbank relationship in detail. Marker is very suspicious of authority figures, especially policemen, and Firbank‚Äîat least initially‚Äîconsiders enquiry agents to be a lower form of life. The two gradually come to like each other, even when their relationship is tested‚Äîthe final episode of the series is \\"John VII, Verse 24\\" (29 September 1971) in which it appears Firbank is corrupt and is accepting money from known criminals. Series 5 also demonstrates the variety that the programme could offer: in \\"Well‚ÄîThere Was This Girl, You See...\\" Marker again becomes involved in stolen jewels, but is exceptionally careful, too careful as it turns out, as his tactic of exerting pressure on a young man he thinks is involved backfires when he chooses to run to the police rather than Marker, and wrecks Marker's chances of getting a share of the reward money. An embarrassed Marker has to explain to an amused Firbank what has gone wrong. In \\"Shades of White\\", Marker is hired to monitor the suspicious activities of an ambitious local businessman's daughter‚Äîhe becomes friendly with the businessman's housekeeper but then has his trust betrayed (again) when it transpires the housekeeper is acting to receive items stolen by the daughter's friends. Lighter moments in series 5 come with \\"Transatlantic Cousins\\" as a visiting American hires Marker to trace his English relatives, assisted by the tourist's daughter. They find out that the American family does have an English relative who has inherited a baronetcy but the daughter also discovers that, because of a previously unknown member of the family who was killed in a war, her father is actually the rightful inheritor of the title. Marker's failed alliances A further series of Eton-based episodes aired from 8 November 1972 to 14 February 1973, with the series now fully in colour. The final series began on 6 January 1975 with another arc of related episodes. Starting with \\"Nobody Wants To Know\\", Marker investigates a horse-doping racket being run by an organised criminal gang. He ignores warnings to drop the case, because he \\"doesn't like being bullied\\" but gets a serious beating-up for this. The next episode, \\"How About a Cup of Tea?\\", recalls the Brighton era as Marker comes out of hospital and his friends (including Firbank and a returning Mrs Mortimer) attempt to rally round him and cheer him up. He tries to find a career other than enquiries but is told by an unhelpful job centre clerk (Robin Askwith) that he is too old to do anything new. The episode concentrates again on Marker and how, with his friends to help him, he pulls himself out of the negative cycle of self-pity and depression. The final episode of the trilogy is \\"How About It, Frank?\\", in which he reluctantly takes revenge on those responsible for his beating up and narrowly avoids another encounter with the wrong side of the law. He enters into a partnership with another enquiry agent, Ron Gash (Peter Childs). Gash is an ex-policeman and, although much more likeable than Rylands (of the Brighton episodes) he does have very different ideas about the job from Marker. Although Marker would show interest in money if a large quantity of it appeared to be heading his way (such as \\"Well‚ÄîThere Was This Girl, You See ...\\") he never considers raising his fees to provide himself with a more comfortable living standard. Gash is far more profit-motivated and also considers Marker's shabby appearance to be off-putting to potential clients. Yet again Marker decides he doesn't like working with a partner, and in the episode \\"What's to Become of Us?\\" (10 February 1975) Gash and he part ways peacefully and amicably. For the final half-dozen episodes Marker relocates to Chertsey in Surrey, partly to avoid a clash of location with Gash's business. The move to Chertsey sees the series return to its traditional format of a new case each week for Marker. In \\"Fit of Conscience\\" he is asked to investigate the collapse of a residential apartment block and it becomes apparent that the concrete has been incorrectly formulated. Those responsible for this, the primary cause of the collapse, leave the country and avoid being brought to British justice for their actions. The series often produced such downbeat endings, with the villains getting away with their crimes or at the very least, with the resolution unclear and further thought required on the part of the viewer. The end of the series, its fate and legacy Public Eye came to an end on 7 April 1975 with the episode \\"Unlucky For Some\\". A hotel owner asks Marker to investigate his wife's odd behaviour. It transpires that her first husband is still alive and she is being blackmailed about this. Marker traces the first husband and plans to claim a large reward on offer for doing so, only to find that, 15 minutes before he could stake his claim, the blackmailer has carried out his threat and has therefore obtained the money. Marker is left with nothing and, ten years after he first appeared on British TV screens, Frank Marker still needs to take every case that comes his way in order to make ends meet. Thames had not wanted to end the series at this point. The intention was that Euston Films, Thames' film-making subsidiary, would continue with an eighth and final series but would make it on film, rather than the PAL 625-line video format which it had been recorded on up till then. This made sense as Euston had a good track record, having scored major successes with Van der Valk, their revamped version of Special Branch, and The Sweeney. These were generally larger-scale, glossier and more 'action- packed' operations than the more intimate Public Eye. Alfred Burke, fearing that the move onto film would mean the series would lose its particular, low- key identity, decided not to take up the option. Public Eye became largely forgotten and confined to archival oblivion for almost twenty years, despite being a popular favourite for a decade and a ratings-topper in its time.Screen Online One episode (\\"Who Wants To Be Told Bad News?\\" from series 5) was repeated in 1989 to mark Thames Television's 21st anniversary, but thereafter nothing more happened. Thames then lost its franchise in controversial circumstances in 1992. Thames' successor Carlton Television considered remaking the series in the 1990s, but again nothing came of this. Recognition returned in 1995 when British satellite channel UK Gold (then part-owned by Thames) repeated all the colour Thames episodes from series 5 onwards. UK Gold had a policy of not showing any black and white material; thus the Brighton episodes and \\"Shades of White\\" remained unscreened. A small group of British Television enthusiasts, Kaleidoscope, did much to promote the programme and negotiated the rights to rescreen, at conventions and meetings, many of the black-and-white Thames episodes and the remaining ABC episodes. They also unearthed a 1968 ABC promotional reel, on a long-obsolete domestic videotape format, which included a five-minute extract from the otherwise-missing third series episode \\"Must Be the Architecture, Can't Be the Climate\\" and audio recordings of several lost ABC episodes. Most notably, Kaleidoscope organised and hosted a 'Public Eye: Thirtieth Anniversary' convention in 1995. This was attended by Alfred Burke in person. The television channel Talking Pictures TV began repeating the series from series 4 onwards in October 2018. DVD release Network Video issued the Brighton series in a three-DVD box set in mid-2004, complete with some restoration work. Bonus material included the complete ABC episode \\"Nobody Kills Santa Claus\\" and the above-mentioned extract from \\"Must Be The Architecture...\\" Sales of the box set were moderate; a follow-up four-disc set of Series 5, including the ABC episode \\"Don't Forget You're Mine\\", was released in December 2004. Network released the 1972/3 and 1975 series on DVD in 2008, and the remaining ABC material on 27 August 2012 (2-DVD set, Network/StudioCanal 7953731). A 17-disc box set of every surviving episode, including a book on the making of the series by Andrew Pixley, plus interviews with Alfred Burke and surviving episode fragments and audio soundtracks, was released by Network Video in 2012. (A Box Named Frank, 7953697). Theme music The downbeat, moody theme music for the series was composed by Robert Sharples, writing under the pseudonym of Robert Earley. Sharples was perhaps best known as musical director of Opportunity Knocks but had several memorable TV themes to his credit, as well as being a skilled conductor.

The role is equivalent to an aide-de-camp, but the term is now prevalent only in the Commonwealth of Nations.

There are now three equerries to the Queen of the United Kingdom, at least one of whom is in attendance on the Sovereign on a daily basis. For some years the Queen's senior equerry has also held the position of Deputy Master of the Household. The Queen's permanent equerry is an officer of OF3-OF4 (Maj-Lt Col) rank or equivalent, recruited from the three services of the British Armed Forces in turn. Many previous equerries have gone on to reach higher rank. The Queen's temporary equerry is a captain of the Coldstream Guards, who provides part- time attendance. When not required for duty, an equerry has additional regimental or staff duties. Senior members of the British Royal Family each also have one or two equerries.

She has been a primary figure in the development of the marimba, in terms of expanding both technique and repertoire, and through her collaboration with the Yamaha Corporation, developed the modern five-octave concert marimba.  Biography  Abe began playing the xylophone while in elementary school in Tokyo, Japan, studying under Eiichi Asabuki. At age 13, she won an NHK talent contest and began performing professionally on live radio. She attended Tokyo Gakugei University where she completed a bachelor's and master's degree in music education. She began working in the Nippon Columbia, NHK and other recording studios while in college. In 1962, she and two friends (who were also students of Asabuki) founded the Xebec Marimba Trio, performing popular music, arrangements of folk songs and some of Abe's arrangements. They recorded more than seven albums between 1962 and 1966. During this period she had her own show on Japanese television, instructing schoolchildren in xylophone playing, as well as a radio show called \\"Good Morning Marimba\\". She also began her recording career, putting out 13 albums in a five-year span. In 1963, the Yamaha Corporation sought Japanese marimba players to assist in the design of their new instruments; Keiko Abe was chosen for her original and clear ideas of the marimba sound and design, particularly her concept of how the marimba should be able to blend in ensembles, for example, moving away from the inconsistencies and lack of focus of folk percussion instruments. Her ideas for the desired sound of the instruments guided Yamaha's design, and in the 1970s began production. In addition, at her urging, the range of the new marimba was stretched from four octaves to five, which has become the standard for soloists. Abe has been closely associated with Yamaha ever since, and their first ever signature series of keyboard percussion mallets bears her name. Her compositions, including \\"Michi\\", \\"Variations on Japanese Children's Songs\\", and \\"Dream of the Cherry Blossoms\\", have become standards of the marimba repertoire. Abe is active in promoting the development of literature for the marimba, not only by writing pieces herself, but also by commissioning works by other composers and encouraging young composers. She has added at least 70 compositions to the repertoire. She uses improvisation as an important element in developing her musical ideas which she then uses in her compositions. In addition to her intensive composing, touring, and recording schedule, Abe has been a lecturer, then professor, at the Toho Gakuen School of Music in Tokyo since 1970. She was the first woman to be inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 1993. Abe uses the YM-6100 Marimba made by Yamaha. Her music is mainly published by Xebec Music Publishing and Schott, Japan.  References  * J. Michele Edwards. \\"Keiko Abe\\", Grove Music Online, ed. L.

It includes details of Operation Deadstick, the coup de main operation by gliderborne troops to capture both Pegasus Bridge and Horsa Bridge before the main assault on the Normandy beaches. It sold tens of millions of copies in eighteen different languages. It is based on interviews with a cross-section of participants, including U.S., Canadian, British, French and German officers and civilians. The book begins and ends in the village of La Roche-Guyon. The book refers to the village as being the most occupied village in occupied France and states that for each of the 543 inhabitants of La Roche-Guyon there were more than 3 German soldiers in the village and surrounding area. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel commander-in-chief of Army Group B had his headquarters in the castle of the village which was the seat of the Duc de La Rochefoucauld. Ryan's book is divided into three parts: the first part is titled \\"The Wait\\", the second part is named \\"The Night\\" and the third part is named \\"The Day\\". The book includes a section on the casualties of D-Day and also lists the contributors including their service details on the day of the invasion and their occupations at the time the book was first published. Ryan dedicated his book for all the men of D-Day. Researchers spent almost three years locating survivors of D-Day and over 3000 interviews were undertaken in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, France and Germany. 383 accounts of D-Day were used in the text of the book. Senior Allied officers who assisted the author included General Maxwell D. Taylor, Lieutenant General James M. Gavin, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick E. Morgan and General Sir Richard Nelson Gale. German officers who assisted with the book included Generaloberst Franz Halder, Hauptmann Hellmuth Lang and General der Infanterie G√ºnther Blumentritt. The author also used Allied and German post action reports, War diaries, histories and official records. On 6 June 1965, the author published an article \\"More of The Longest Day\\" in Reader's Digest as a supplement. Editor Peter Schwed gave the book its title from a comment made by the German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to his aide Hauptmann Helmuth Lang on April 22, 1944: \\"...the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive...the fate of Germany depends on the outcome...for the Allies, as well as Germany, it will be the longest day.\\" In 1962, the book was adapted into a Hollywood film of the same name. In May 2014, publisher Andre Deutsch released the 70th Anniversary Collector's Edition, with the addition of 120 photographs, 30 unpublished removable facsimile documents from the Cornelius Ryan Archive and cover by Brazilian photographer Rodrigo Bressane, depicting an interpretation of the iconic Helmet in Omaha Beach, as seen on the Hollywood adaptation.

He was a journeyman lithographic artist in Switzerland and Paris until 1847. His first known American print (credited to \\"C Bachmann\\" as artist and \\"J Bachmann\\" as publisher) appeared in 1848, a view from an imagined point above Union Square in New York, looking south toward The Battery. In 1849 and 1850, he created and published a series of American views, including views of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans and Havana. Both directly copied and used as a primary source by other lithographers at home and in Europe, these were the first major bird's eye views (drawn from an imagined perspective), as opposed to panoramic views (views drawn directly from the artists experience) in the United States (smaller views had appeared as early as the 1820s). Although best known for his views of New York, his name is attached to a variety of prints, including the well-known \\"Bird's Eye View of the Seat of War\\" series produced during the American Civil War, which show the theater of war in six sections, each a perspective view of entire states or sets of states. Bachmann married and had four children, the eldest of whom, John Bachmann, Jr. also became a lithographer. Except for two brief sojourns in Philadelphia, he appears to have remained in the Heights neighborhood of Jersey City from the late 1850s until his death in 1896. Most of his views of New York City manage to sneak in his home neighborhood in Jersey City. His last known work, a view of Havana, is now in the collection of the Library of Congress. The one other known painting by Bachmann, a version of one of his views of Philadelphia, hangs in the Free Library of Philadelphia.

He was believed to be one of the wealthiest men of the state, owning tens of thousands of acres of land, many slaves, several distilleries, a tavern, and ferries. Early life and education Clay was born in Powhatan County, Virginia in 1757 to Charles and Martha Clay. After serving in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, he joined the westward migration to Kentucky, where he became a surveyor. This gave him a chance to assess lands for cultivation and development. He was a cousin of US Congressman and statesman Henry Clay and Alabama governor Clement Comer Clay. Kentucky Clay developed and owned several distilleries and a tavern in central Kentucky, where development occurred near Lexington. He also started a business providing ferry service at several stops across the winding Kentucky River. In 1789 he was elected Kentucky's representative to the Virginia House of Delegates (when the western territory was still part of that state). Later he was elected and served in both the house and senate of the Kentucky General Assembly. Marriage and family In 1795, Green Clay at 38 married the much younger Sally Lewis (d. 1867) in Kentucky. She was the daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth (Payne) Lewis. They had seven children, of whom six survived to adulthood.\\"Portrait of Green Clay\\", White Hall-Clermont Foundation, accessed 4 February 2014 Their first child was Elizabeth Lewis Clay (1798-1887)\\"KOAR's Russian Connection\\", Kentucky Online Arts Resource Blog, 15 October 2012 and other daughters were Pauline, Sallie, and Sophia (b. 1813; d. 1814). .E.

Clay (b.1808), Elijah (b. 1815), and Cassius Marcellus Clay (b.1810). At age 17, Elizabeth married John Speed Smith, who became a politician in Kentucky and U.S. Congressman. Their son Green Clay Smith was named for his maternal grandfather; like his father, maternal uncles Brutus and Cassius, and cousins, he also became a politician in Kentucky and the U.S. Congress. War of 1812 During the War of 1812, Clay was commissioned as a general in the Kentucky militia. In the spring of 1813, he was ordered to the aid of General William Henry Harrison, who was besieged by British forces at Fort Meigs, Ohio. Clay fought his way into the fort; however, many of his men were taken prisoner by Tecumseh after they had captured a British artillery battery. When the British abandoned the siege, Clay was left in command of the fort. He was still commanding when the British returned in July 1813. In an attempt by Tecumseh to lure Clay and the garrison out of the fort, the native warriors staged a mock battle, appearing to ambush a column of American reinforcements. Clay was not fooled, since he knew no reinforcements were coming. He was able to hold out until the British again retreated. Later years After the war, Clay returned to his plantation, and spent the rest of his life directing the labor of his many slaves in cultivating commodity crops of tobacco and hemp. He is thought to have been the wealthiest man in Kentucky of his time, as his many slaves were valuable as property. He died at his home in 1828 at the age of 73, and was buried with Masonic rites in Richmond, Kentucky.\\"Green Clay\\", The Political Graveyard His widow Sally Lewis Clay married again, to Jeptha Dudley, a Baptist minister.

It displays science and astronomy pictures and information, and it is located inside the transfer tunnel. It was opened on 1988 and became the first Latin American scientific exhibition installed in a public transport location. The purpose is to provide scientific information to passengers and it is aimed at young people since a large number of them are students at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). The tunnel measures () and features images of the autumn-sky constellations, planets and satellites, the Milky Way, and, in the middle of the tunnel, there is a drawn-to-scale representation of the celestial sphere displaying the constellations, drawn with luminous paint. The exhibition was installed by Universum, UNAM's science museum. It is estimated that visit it with the guided tour service. In 2018, the Institute of Astronomy of the UNAM (es) remodeled the tunnel. Other exhibitions On 2008, the Metro authorities installed the 1997 mural Monstruos de fin de milenio (), which was painted and donated to the metro system by Mexican painter Ariosto Otero Reyes (es). In , the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) of the IPN exhibited multiple human brains, their anatomy, and some injuries they suffered. In , the Geology Museum of the UNAM (es) displayed rocks, fossils, minerals, and a shark jaw. In June 2016, the system featured an exhibition of 80 preserved human body parts by the Tominaga Nakamoto University, a dusplay of 50 sculptures by Nour Kuri representing human bodies, and 6 photographs by Duilio Rodr√≠guez representing pain. In May and , La Raza station hosted exhibitions by Manuel de la Cera, Norma Pati√±o, Teresa Olalde, and the Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM)'s LibroFest. From to 2018, the Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development (SAGARPA) and the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO) displayed an exposition in the tunnel on bees and their ecological importance. In 2020, the station temporarily displayed pictures, landscapes, and sculptures created by Swiss artist H. R. Giger. In , the Government of Mexico City built a bicycle parking station outside La Raza station.

He was the longtime companion of Jacqueline Onassis, former First Lady of the United States.  Early life  Tempelsman was born on August 26, 1929 in Antwerp, Belgium, the son of Leon and Helene Tempelsman, both Orthodox Jews, in a Yiddish-speaking family in Antwerp's Jewish community. In 1940, Tempelsman and his family emigrated to the United States to escape persecution by Nazi Germany during World War II. When he was 16, Tempelsman began working for his father, a diamond broker. He attended New York City's public schools and New York University.  Business interests  In 1950, Tempelsman created a new marketing niche by persuading the US government to stockpile African diamonds for industrial and military purposes, with him as middleman. In 1957, at the age of 27, he and his lawyer, Adlai Stevenson, traveled to Africa, where Tempelsman had begun forging ties with leaders. His contacts eventually ranged from South African anti-apartheid politician Oliver Tambo to Zaire's kleptocratic dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko and the influential Oppenheimer diamond family. Tempelsman is chairman of the board of directors of Lazare Kaplan International Inc. (LKI), the largest diamond company in the United States, noted for its \\"ideal cut\\" diamonds sold worldwide under the brand name, Lazare Diamonds. Tempelsman is one of fewer than 90 ‚Ä≥sightholders‚Ä≥ in the world, which means that 10 times a year he is permitted to buy diamonds directly from the powerful De Beers cartel in the City of London. Because DeBeers was a virtual monopoly, for many years it could not operate legally in the United States. Maurice Tempelsman sitting at a table with Nicolae Ceausescu (not in this detail of the photo) in Romania July 1974. He is also a general partner of Leon Tempelsman & Son, an investment company specializing in real estate and venture capital.  Philanthropic and political activities  Tempelsman maintains relations with political and business leaders, in particular government leaders in Africa and Russia, and leading figures in the U.S. Democratic Party. His extensive political contacts and monetary contributions often provide him with access and prestige in those markets, as was the case during the presidency of Bill Clinton. From 1993 to 1997, Tempelsman visited the White House at least ten times, met privately with Hillary Clinton on two separate occasions, vacationed with the Clintons and the Kennedy family in Martha's Vineyard, and flew to Moscow and back with President Clinton on Air Force One. In Southern Africa, Tempelsman has played a key role in negotiations between hostile governments and companies engaging in diamond exploration. He met with Mobutu Sese Seko, to assist the regime's business dealings with De Beers. In the 1960s Tempelsman hired as his business agent the CIA station chief in Kinshasa, Larry Devlin, who helped put Mobutu in power and afterward served as his personal adviser. From March 3, 1977, Tempelsman briefly held the title of honorary consul general for Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), at the DRC's consular offices in New York City. In addition to the DRC, Tempelsman has played a key role in the diamond industries of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and Sierra Leone. Tempelsman served as chairman of the Corporate Council on Africa (CCA) from 1999 to 2002 and again from 2007 to 2008, after which he was named chairman emeritus. An example of his work with the CCA involved assisting government leaders with establishing the New Partnership for Africa's Development. Tempelsman was a board member of the Southern African Enterprise Development Fund, and past chairman and long- serving board member of the Africa-America Institute. Tempelsman is a trustee of the Eurasia Foundation, and a director of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Center for National Policy, the Business Council for International Understanding, and the U.S.-Russia Business Council. He is chairman of the International Advisory Council of the Harvard School of Public Health's AIDS Initiative, and is an honorary trustee and an honorary member of the corporation of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Tempelsman is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and was named a visitor to the Department of Classical Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. A director of the Academy of American Poets, Tempelsman also serves as a trustee of the New York University Institute of Fine Arts, and on Lenox Hill Hospital's Advisory Board. He has served on several Presidential Commissions including the President's Commission for the Observance of Human Rights, the Citizen's Advisory Board of Youth Opportunities and the National Highway Safety Advisory Committee, and was appointed to the New York Council on International Business. Personal life=Marriage and children Tempelsman has grown children by his wife Lilly Bucholz, who had also fled Antwerp with her family. They were married in 1949. Their daughter, Rena, is the widow of Robert Speisman, an executive vice president of Lazare Kaplan International Inc. who died on board American Airlines Flight 77, when the aircraft crashed into The Pentagon during the September 11 attacks. Tempelsman and Bucholz formally separated in 1984. According to People, Bucholz and Tempelsman never legally divorced.  Relationship with Jacqueline Onassis  Tempelsman was the longtime companion of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Maurice and Lilly Tempelsman were guests at the State Dinner given at Mount Vernon, Virginia in honor of the President Ayub Khan of Pakistan in 1961. The two began their lengthy relationship in 1980, five years after the death of Jacqueline Onassis' second husband Aristotle Onassis. In 1988, Tempelsman moved into Onassis's Fifth Avenue penthouse apartment in New York City. During their relationship, he handled Onassis's finances, quadrupling the $26 million that was secured from her late husband's estate. The couple frequently took walks through Central Park and were photographed doing so in the days preceding her death from Non-Hodgkin lymphoma at age 64 on May 19, 1994. At Onassis's funeral service, Tempelsman read Constantine P. Cavafy's poem Ithaca, one of her favorites, and concluded by saying: \\"And now the journey is over, too short, alas, too short. It was filled with adventure and wisdom, laughter and love, gallantry and grace. So farewell, farewell.\\" Tempelsman was one of two executors of the will that she had drawn up with her long-time attorney, Alexander D. Forger. She left him a \\"Greek alabaster head of a woman\\" and named Tempelsman to be a co‚Äëchair of a charitable organization, the C & J Foundation. However, there was no residuary left to fund the foundation after estate taxes were paid.

The francophones of the region can trace their origins to Continental French fishermen who settled in the late 1800s and early 1900s, rather than the Qu√©b√©cois. Some Acadians of the Maritimes also settled in the area. For this reason, Newfoundland French is most closely related to the Norman and Breton French of nearby St-Pierre-et-Miquelon. Today, heavy contact with Acadian French--and especially widespread bilingualism with Newfoundland English--have taken their toll, and the community is in decline. The degree to which lexical features of Newfoundland French constitute a distinct dialect is not presently known. It is uncertain how many speakers survive; the dialect could be moribund. There is a provincial advocacy organisation F√©d√©ration des Francophones de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador, representing both the Peninsular French and Acadian French communities. Distribution Newfoundland French communities include Cap-St-Georges, Petit Jardin, Grand Jardin, De Grau, Rousseau Rouge, La Pointe √† Luc, Trois Cailloux, La Grand‚Äôterre, L‚ÄôAnse-aux- Canards, Maisons-d‚ÄôHiver and Lourdes. In addition, there is a town named Port Aux Basques on the western side of Newfoundland. There are also nearby Acadian French communities in the Codroy Valley and Stephenville. These francophones speak in the Acadian dialect of French, and not Newfoundland French. History=Origins France contested ownership of Newfoundland from 1662 until 1713, when it ceded the island to Great Britain as part of the Treaty of Utrecht. During the Seven Years' War France (and Spain) vied for control of Newfoundland and the valuable fisheries off its shores. Fighting ceased in 1763, with French fishing rights to the western coast enshrined in the Treaty of Paris. This period saw an influx of Breton, Norman and Basque fishermen to the region, though most of the activity was seasonal, and French settlement before the late 1800s was forbidden. Despite British disapproval, the clandestine settlement continued, though without the benefit of schools and essential services. As a result, literacy among Francophones was uncommon in the twentieth century. In 1904 ownership of the region was transferred from France to the Colony of Newfoundland. In addition to French immigration from Europe, Acadian immigrants arrived from Cape Breton Island and the Magdalen Islands to colonize Cape Saint-George, the Codroy Valley and Stephenville called \\"l'Anse-aux-Sauvages\\" (the Cove of Savages) beginning in the 19th century. Until the middle of the 20th century, fishermen from Brittany who spoke Breton as their mother tongue, but were educated in French through the Jules Ferry schools, came to establish themselves on the Port-au-Port peninsula; this is arguably the primary cause for the differences between Newfoundland and Acadian French. Contact with anglophone populations, bilingualism, and assimilation Contact between francophone and anglophone Newfoundlanders had been historically both limited and normally peaceful. In the first half of the twentieth century, the west coast of Newfoundland was roughly evenly distributed with English-speaking and French-speaking families, mostly working within their own linguistic communities. The major exception was the Catholic Church, wherein the priests were nearly always monolingually English-speaking. This strongly encouraged bilingualism in the francophone community and laid the seeds for assimilation. In 1940, the establishment of the American air force base at Stephenville began French Newfoundland‚Äôs decline. Newfoundland French and Acadian French speakers who had lived and worked their entire lives in relative francophone isolation now found themselves at the heart of an American, Canadian, British and Newfoundlander anglophone economic centre. Families were grateful for the economic opportunities brought by the base, but transmission of French across generations dropped-off dramatically. The absence of French-language education and the mandatory attendance of all children in English-speaking schools, as well as both radio and television programs in English, caused more recent generations to fail to master more complicated grammar and subject matter in French. English was becoming the only language of the educated. Patrice Brasseur, a French linguist, has made numerous visits to the island. In speaking with remaining elderly Newfoundland francophones, he has found that French-speaking children were often punished for speaking French at school. Marriages between francophone and anglophone Catholics also became a contributing factor in assimilation, with intermarriages becoming more common from the 1930s onward. Confederation Since 1949, when Newfoundland became a Canadian province, the use of French on the island has continued to decline. The presence of French was ignored by both governments, similarly to the Mi'kmaq populations, with there being no official position on the matter, but with the de facto policy of assimilation. As a result of the absence of francophone education and religious teaching, Newfoundland French is now spoken by only a handful of elderly residents and is considered moribund. Typically, Franco-Newfoundlanders in Newfoundland now use Acadian French rather than the Newfoundland dialect, though a small number of families still speak a strongly inflected hybrid dialect. Today, 15,000 descendants of French settlers live in the province, and there is a movement to reestablish the Newfoundland dialect as the French language of education in the province. However, schoolchildren in the province are currently being introduced to either standard Canadian French, or an Acadian-influenced variety thereof.

It was directed by John Lee Hancock, produced by Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, and Mark Johnson, distributed by Touchstone Pictures, and starred Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston, Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett, and Jason Patric as Jim Bowie. The screenplay is credited to Hancock, John Sayles, Stephen Gaghan, and Leslie Bohem. In contrast to the 1960 film of the same name, this film attempts to depict the political points of view of both the Mexican and Texan sides; Santa Anna is a more prominent character. The film received mixed reviews by critics and was a box office bomb, losing the studio over $146 million. Plot The film begins in March 1836 in the town of San Antonio de Bexar, showing the aftermath of the Battle of the Alamo. The film then flashes back to a year earlier. Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) attends a party where he tries to persuade people to migrate to Texas and encounters David Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), recently defeated in his bid for re- election to Congress. In San Felipe, Texas, the Texas provisional government is meeting to discuss what action to take after the recent capture of the Alamo and Bexar by the Texans at the first Battle of San Antonio de Bexar. Texas has rebelled against Mexico, and its dictatorial president Santa Anna is personally leading an army to retake the Alamo. The Texan War Party calls for the Texas army to depart Bexar, cross into Mexico and confront the Mexican forces at Matamoros. The Opposition Party seeks to rebuild the Texan army and establish a permanent government. The provisional government votes out Sam Houston as commander of the Texas army; a disgusted Houston tells Jim Bowie to go to San Antonio and destroy the Alamo. The provisional government in turn orders William Barret Travis (Patrick Wilson) to take command of the Alamo. Travis, feeling that the Alamo's small force cannot withstand the Mexican Army, sends a rider to deliver a plea for reinforcements. As small groups of Texans arrive, Travis oversees defense preparations, hoping that enough reinforcements will arrive before the inevitable attack. Crockett arrives in San Antonio, where he finds the other defenders impatient for Santa Anna to arrive. When Santa Anna arrives earlier than anticipated, the Texans retire to the Alamo compound despite its vulnerability, and begin fortifying it as best they can. Travis continues to write for reinforcements, but only few men arrive. Santa Anna's army surrounds the compound, and the siege begins. Bowie meets with Mexican General Manuel Castrill√≥n (Castulo Guerra) to talk things over, but Travis stubbornly fires a cannon at the Mexican camp, abruptly ending their conversation. Bowie returns to tell Travis that Santa Anna has offered the opportunity to surrender. Travis passes this to his men, but the defenders decide to stay and fight. With his hopes of an easy victory foiled, Santa Anna orders to grant no quarter against the Alamo defenders. Bowie becomes ill and is rendered bedridden. On the final day of the siege, the Mexicans launch a surprise attack before dawn. Despite taking heavy casualties, they breach the walls of the mission, and Travis is killed. Overwhelmed, the Texans fall back to the buildings, where they, including Bowie, are all slain. Crockett and the last remaining defenders retreat to the church, where they make their last stand. Crockett is taken prisoner, and in a final act of defiance he mockingly offers to safely lead Santa Anna to Sam Houston. Santa Anna angrily orders Crockett to be executed. Days later, after hearing that the Alamo has been taken, Houston, once again in command of the Texan army, orders a general retreat eastward. They are pursued by the victorious Mexican Army, led by the confident Santa Anna. In an attempt to catch the retreating Texans, and against the advice of his officers, Santa Anna splits his army, leaving only a few hundred men to defend him. A few weeks later, Houston halts his retreat near the San Jacinto, where he decides to face the Mexicans in a final stand. With the support of two cannons and a small group of mounted Tejanos, Houston surprises Santa Anna's army during its afternoon siesta, and in the ensuing rout the vengeful Texans massacre at least seven hundred Mexican soldiers and capture Santa Anna. In exchange for his life, Santa Anna agrees to order all Mexican troops to withdraw from Texas and accept Texan independence. The film ends with Crockett standing on a roof of the Alamo, playing his violin and overlooking the compound.

The set of the Alamo used during filming. The film was conceived by Imagine Entertainment, with Ron Howard as director and partner Brian Grazer as producer. Russell Crowe was cast as Sam Houston, Ethan Hawke as William Barret Travis and Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett. But there were financial and creative disagreements between Imagine and Disney, particularly over Howard's proposed budget. Disney rejected Imagine's proposal, and Crowe and Hawke left the project. Disney opted for director John Lee Hancock and a budget of $107 million. Thornton remained with the project as Crockett, while Howard and Grazer were credited as producers. A full $35 million was spent promoting the film.A Battle Disney May Never Forget; For 'The Alamo,' a Long and Bumpy Road, From Conception to Release The film was shot between January and June of 2003, primarily using sets built on a ranch in Travis County, near Austin. Filming on the Alamo set Most of the film was shot at a ranch near Austin; at 51 acres, it was the largest set ever built in North America (at the time). A number of buildings, including the mission, were constructed for the film, at a cost of about $10 million. They depicted a Spanish colonial village. The sets were subsequently abandoned but were visited occasionally, at the Milton Reimers Ranch Park, although they were deteriorating; they were not intended to endure for a long period of time. Nine of the 12 major structures were damaged in a fire in September 2011.Fire destroys set of 2004 \\"Alamo\\" remake in TexasAlamo movie set burned by fire The park's web site in 2020 makes no mention of the movie or the sets.Milton Reimers Ranch Park Hancock's version was purported to be the most accurate of all the Alamo films, but various liberties were taken, such as building the Alamo chapel facade forward 40 feet more than the extant (and presumably historically- correct) structure. According to one of the DVD version's special features, Hancock did that to show the Alamo chapel and the interior of the fort in one shot. Battle scenes In the winter of 1835‚Äì1836, when the Mexican Army was moving north through desert areas, shortly before it crossed the Rio Bravo (Rio Grande), it endured a snowstorm of uncommon intensity, and soldiers suffered illness and hunger. Snow making machines were used to create the scenes of the march through the snow. Four days later, a snow storm blanketed the set, for real. Two calls were made to find thin and gaunt extras to play the soldiers, but the film's scenes of the attack on the Alamo were shot in harsh weather. Extras stood for hours in cold rain, making some scenes gruelingly realistic. A few days of the filming was held up, due to bitter cold and very muddy conditions. Final editing After the film was shot, it was edited down to three hours; later it was reduced to two hours, with scenes and certain characters removed. Shortly prior to the release, 15 minutes were added. Nonetheless, Quaid's role had been significantly reduced from the first version.A Battle Disney May Never Forget; For 'The Alamo,' a Long and Bumpy Road, From Conception to Release Historical accuracy The depiction of Crockett's fate came from memoirs supposedly written by Jos√© Enrique de la Pe√±a, an officer in Santa Anna's army. It was the first film to show Crockett executed as a prisoner of war; all others had depicted his death as occurring during the battle. That sparked criticism from many Alamo enthusiasts and some historians, given the dubious legitimacy of its origins. Reception The film received mixed reviews. It holds a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the main consensus being \\"Too conventional and un-involving to be memorable.\\" It holds a Metacritic score of 47/100, indicating \\"mixed or average\\" reviews. Variety called it \\"a historically credible but overly prosaic account of the most celebrated episode in the creation of an Americanized Texas.\\" The Houston Chronicle gave the film a grade of \\"B\\", saying Hancock, whom the paper points out is a \\"former Houstonian\\", \\"shows respect if not reverence for his state's mythical heritage, even while viewing it from modern perspectives\\"; it notes the \\"build-up to battle is prolonged and talky, and for a classic tale of heroic defiance, this Alamo feels more restrained than rousing. Again, it's no-win. When Hancock supplies history, the action and drama bog down. And even when he's right, he's wrong, since so many historians disagree about what happened at the site in what is now Downtown San Antonio.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave it a \\"C+\\", saying \\"Hancock's moderate, apolitical, war-is-hell dramatization of the famous 1836 battle that shaped the future of a free and independent American Texas isn't nearly the flop that the exceptionally harsh and unavoidable advance chatter has suggested it is. (It's not the jingoistic call to patriotism of John Wayne's 1960 version, either.) But The Alamo never harmonizes into a cinematic experience any more resonant than the average, manly, why-we-fight pic, or coalesces into a stirring cry for freedom.\\" According to Roger Ebert, \\"Conventional wisdom in Hollywood is that any movie named The Alamo must be simplistic and rousing, despite the fact that we already know all the defenders got killed. (If we don't know it, we find out in the first scene.) Here is a movie that captures the loneliness and dread of men waiting for two weeks for what they expect to be certain death, and it somehow succeeds in taking those pop-culture brand names like Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie and giving them human form.\\" He gave the film 3 and a half stars out of 4. The film was a box office flop. Its opening was overshadowed by The Passion of the Christ, and first weekend earnings were only $9.1 million. The film closed with $22.4 million in the domestic market, and only $25.8 million in total, on a $107 million budget. The Alamo remains one of the biggest box office bombs of all time.Eller, Claudia,\\"The costliest box office flops of all time\\", Los Angeles Times (January 15, 2014) See also * Battle of the Alamo * The Alamo (1960 film), starring John Wayne * The Last Command (1955 film), starring Sterling Hayden ReferencesExternal links Alamo Sentry: Popular Culture of The Alamo * View of movie set from Google Maps 2004 films 2000s Western (genre) films American films American Western (genre) films English-language films Spanish-language films Films set in San Antonio Films set in 1836 Films shot in Texas Texas Revolution films American war drama films Imagine Entertainment films Touchstone Pictures films Films directed by John Lee Hancock Films produced by Ron Howard Cultural depictions of Davy Crockett Films with screenplays by Stephen Gaghan Films scored by Carter Burwell Siege films Epic films based on actual events Films with screenplays by John Lee Hancock ","title":"The Alamo (2004 film)"},{"id":"1343167","text":"Chinese and Mongolian mode of dumb bargain Silent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter (\\"dumb\\" here used in its old meaning of \\"mute\\"), or depot trade, is a method by which traders who cannot speak each other's language can trade without talking. Group A would leave trade goods in a prominent position and signal, by gong, fire, or drum for example, that they had left goods. Group B would then arrive at the spot, examine the goods and deposit their trade goods or money that they wanted to exchange and withdraw. Group A would then return and either accept the trade by taking the goods from Group B or withdraw again leaving Group B to add to or change out items to create an equal value. The trade ends when Group A accepts Group B's offer and removes the offered goods leaving Group B to remove the original goods. This system was used in many parts of ancient Africa. Silent trading was mainly used during the period 500 to 1500. The practice was also well established between tribes in Africa in their trade with India. Cosmas Indicopleustes describes this practiced in Azania, where officials from Axum traded for gold with beef.Cited in J. Innes Miller, The Spice Trade of the Roman Empire (Oxford: University Press, 1969), pp. 167f. Although Miller offers an extensive passage in translation, he does not provide the source for his quotation. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal recorded this practice when he occupied Ceuta in 1415. In West Africa gold mined south of the Sahel was traded for salt mined in the desert. The salt from the desert was needed by the people of Sahel to flavor and preserve their food and the gold had obvious value, especially in trading with the European people. Because of this trade, cities grew and flourished and parts of West Africa became commercial centers. West Africa produced large amounts of gold until about 1500 AD. The communication in this gold-for-salt was carried out using drums.Holt World History: The Human Journey. p. 193. Silent trade might be used because of an inability to speak the other traders' language, or to protect the secrets of where the valuable gold and salt came from. Silent bartering has been used since ancient times, such as the ancient Ghana Empire. The Ghanaian salt traders would leave pounds of salt by the Niger river and the gold traders would leave a fair amount of gold in turn. Procedure To perform a silent trade, one group of traders would go to a specific location, leave their trading goods and then withdraw to a distance. Then play a drum to signal the other traders that a silent trade was taking place. The other group of traders would then approach and inspect the goods (most commonly salt or gold). If the goods met with approval, the second group would then take the goods, leave their own goods in return, and depart. This system of trading was used in particular in ancient Ghana. It was also used among the Kushites and the Aksumites. The Greek historian Herodotus wrote about the gold trade with Ghana and Carthage: \\"The Carthaginians also tell us that they trade with a race of men who live in a part of Libya beyond the Pillars of Hercules. On reaching this country, they unload their goods, arrange them tidily along the beach, and then, returning to their boats, raise a smoke. Seeing the smoke, the natives come down to the beach, place on the ground a certain quantity of gold in exchange for the goods, and go off again to a distance. The Carthaginians then come ashore and take a look at the gold; and if they think it represents a fair price for their wares, they collect it and go away; if, on the other hand, it seems too little, they go back aboard and wait, and the natives come and add to the gold until they are satisfied. There is perfect honesty on both sides; the Carthaginians never touch the gold until it equals in value what they have offered for sale, and the natives never touch the goods until the gold has been taken away.\\" <3 Banyan merchants W.S.W. Ruschenberger, M.D., in Zanzibar in 1835, describes Banyan merchants, then cites \\"Establecimientos ultramarinos. Tomo III.

The British Army, supported by Tecumseh's Confederacy, failed to capture the fort during the Siege of Fort Meigs. It is named in honor of Ohio governor Return J. Meigs, Jr., for his support in providing General William Henry Harrison with militia and supplies for the line of forts along the Old Northwest frontier. History Construction of the fort started in February 1813 by soldiers under the command of General William Henry Harrison (future president) at a site where present-day Perrysburg, Ohio developed. It was to provide a supply depot and staging point for US military operations in Canada that would also command the rapids of the Maumee River. The remnants of the British Fort Miami were across the river downstream, to the northeast. The winter climate was harsh, and the landscape unforgiving. A U.S. sentry froze to death during his two hours of guard duty. The walls were constructed using logs cut to a 15-foot length, partially buried in the ground, then protected by a steep earthen slope thrown against the logs to strengthen them against bombardment. An embankment against the interior side provided a parapet. When completed, the fort was the largest wooden walled fortification in North America. The First Siege: On May 1, 1813, British allied forces, under General Henry Proctor and Chief Tecumseh, opened a bombardment of the fort, which had mustered 1,200 regulars and militia, and laid siege. Reinforcements reached the fort on May 4, increasing its garrison to 2,800. Early on the morning of May 5, a detachment from Clay's brigade under Colonel William Dudley landed from boats on the north bank of the river, stormed the British batteries on the north bank and spiked the guns. Coming under fire from Indians in the woods, part of the Kentuckian force pursued Tecumseh's men, who led them deeper into the forest. In the woods, the disorganized Kentuckians suffered heavy casualties in confused fighting. Nearly 550 were captured, and of Dudley's 866 officers and men, only 150 returned to the fort. This became known as \\"Dudley's Massacre\\" or \\"Dudley's Defeat\\". The Shawnee, Delaware (Lenape) and other Native American warriors attacked any wood-gathering parties sent out from the fort. Harrison held out against the British by using a pair of 14-foot high embankments (\\"traverses\\") thrown up inside the walls along the length of the interior to absorb the incoming British shells. Proctor abandoned the siege on May 9, 1813 and retreated to Detroit. The Second Siege: Having mobilized the garrison into an army, Harrison left General Green Clay in command of the fort, much reduced in size from its original layout. In July 1813, the British attempted to appease their allies by again besieging Fort Meigs. The Indians staged a mock battle to lure the garrison out. The Americans, however, saw through the ploy. After the failed siege attempt, the British moved on to Fort Stephenson, where Fremont, Ohio stands today. That attack also failed, causing heavy British losses and forcing their retreat to Canada. Once the British had retreated from the area for good, General Harrison ordered Fort Meigs dismantled. In its place, a small, square stockade was constructed to serve as a supply base and to protect the Maumee rapids. The Treaty of Fort Meigs was signed there in 1817, and the post was abandoned that same year. In 1864, brothers Timothy and Thomas Hayes became the owners of the land on which the fort had stood and were instrumental in preserving it in memory and honor of the men who fought the battles. The heirs of the Hayes brothers sold the property to the state in 1907. On September 1, 1908, the large obelisk monument that can be seen from outside the fort was dedicated by a local veteran of the Civil War to the fallen soldiers of Fort Meigs. The Ohio Historical Society reconstructed the fort in the late 1960s, and its museum, featuring numerous artifacts uncovered during excavation in connection with the rebuilding, opened in 1974. It is a National Historic Landmark. Memorial The museum entrance Fort Meigs Monument, 1910s Today, Fort Meigs is the site of an Ohio State Memorial in Perrysburg, Ohio. The 65-acre (263,000 m¬≤) park includes the full-size 10-acre replica of the 1813 fort. Between 2000 and 2003 its wooden palisades were rebuilt with fresh timbers, the seven blockhouses were repaired, and exhibits or facilities built inside four of them. The $6.2 million renovation project also saw the museum replaced by a Museum and Education Center of 14,000 square feet that features 3,000 square feet of exhibits on Ohio's role in the War of 1812, classrooms for student and adult workshops, and office and maintenance areas. The museum exhibit \\"Legacy of Freedom: Fort Meigs and the War of 1812\\" focuses on the themes of era, conflict, understanding and remembrance. These sections place the War of 1812 into the context of the times and explain Fort Meigs' role in the conflict. The original grand traverse is preserved within the interior of the fort, although erosion has reduced it from its original 14-foot height, and a reverse traverse was constructed to the original specifications by the OHS. Located at the corner of a nearby cemetery are the remains of an original mortar position laid by the British for use during the siege.

The picture also stars Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie and Laurence Harvey as William B. Travis, and the supporting cast features Frankie Avalon, Patrick Wayne, Linda Cristal, Joan O'Brien, Chill Wills, Joseph Calleia, Ken Curtis, Ruben Padilla as Santa Anna, and guest star Richard Boone as Sam Houston. The motion picture was photographed in 70 mm Todd-AO by William H. Clothier and released by United Artists. Plot The film depicts the Battle of the Alamo and the events leading up to it. Sam Houston leads the forces fighting for Texas independence and needs time to build an army. The opposing Mexican forces, led by General Santa Anna, are numerically stronger as well as better-armed and -trained. Nevertheless, the Texans have spirit and morale remains generally high. Lieutenant Colonel William Travis is tasked with defending the Alamo, a former mission in San Antonio. Jim Bowie comes with reinforcements and the defenders prepare. Meanwhile, Davy Crockett arrives with a group of Tennesseans. Santa Anna's armies arrive and surround the fort. The siege begins. An embassy from the Mexican Army approaches the Alamo, and as they list the terms of surrender, Travis fires a cannon, signalling his refusal to surrender. In a nighttime raid, the Texans sabotage a super-sized cannon used by the Mexicans. They maintain high hopes as they are told a strong force led by Colonel James Fannin is on its way to break the siege. Crockett, however, sensing an imminent attack, sends one of his younger men, Smitty, to ask Houston for help, knowing this will perhaps save Smitty's life. The Mexicans frontally attack the Alamo. The defenders hold out and inflict heavy losses on the Mexicans, although the Texans' own losses are not insignificant, and Bowie sustains a leg wound. Morale drops when a messenger informs Travis that Fannin's reinforcements have been ambushed and slaughtered by the Mexicans. Travis chooses to stay with his command and defend the Alamo, but he gives the other defenders the option of leaving. Crockett, Bowie and their men prepare to leave, but an inspired tribute by Travis convinces them to stay and fight to the end. The noncombatants, including most of the women and children, leave the Alamo. On the thirteenth day of the siege, Santa Anna's artillery bombards the Alamo, and the entire Mexican army sweeps forward, attacking on all sides. The defenders kill numerous Mexicans, but the attack is overwhelming and the fortress' walls are breached. Travis tries to rally the men, but is shot and killed. Crockett leads the Texans in the final defense of the fort, but the Mexicans swarm through and overwhelm the defenders. Crockett is killed in the chaos when he is run through by a lance and then blown up as he ignites the powder magazine. Bowie, in bed with his wound, kills several Mexicans but is bayoneted and dies. As the last Texan is killed, the Mexican soldiers discover the hiding place of the wife and child of Texan defender Captain Dickinson. The battle eventually ends with a total victory for the Mexicans. Santa Anna observes the carnage and provides safe passage for Mrs. Dickinson and her child. Smitty returns too late, watching from a distance. He takes off his hat in respect and then escorts Mrs. Dickinson away from the battlefield. The subplot follows the conflict existing among the strong-willed personalities of Travis, Bowie, and Crockett. Travis stubbornly defends his decisions as commander of the garrison against the suggestions of the other two - particularly Bowie with whom the most bitter conflict develops - as well as trying to maintain discipline among a force made up primarily of independently minded frontiersmen and settlers. Crockett, well liked by both Bowie and Travis, eventually becomes a mediator between the other two as Bowie constantly threatens to withdraw his men rather than deal with Travis. Despite their personal conflicts, all three learn to subordinate their differences, and in the end, bind themselves together in an act of bravery to defend the fort against inevitable defeat.

He hired James Edward Grant as scriptwriter, and the two began researching the battle and preparing a draft script. They hired Pat Ford, son of John Ford, as a research assistant. As the script neared completion, however, Wayne and Herbert Yates, the president of Republic Pictures, clashed over the proposed $3 million budget.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 261. Wayne left Republic over the feud but was unable to take his script with him. That script later was rewritten and made into the movie The Last Command with Jim Bowie the character of focus.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 262. Production Wayne and producer Robert Fellows formed Batjac, their own production company. As Wayne developed his vision of what a movie about the Alamo should be, he concluded he did not want to risk seeing that vision changed; he would produce and direct the movie himself, though not act in it. However, he was unable to enlist financial support for the project without the presumptive box-office guarantee his on-screen appearance would provide. In 1956, he signed with United Artists; UA would contribute $2.5 million to the movie's development and serve as distributor. In exchange, Batjac was to contribute an additional $1.5 to $2.5 million, and Wayne would star in the movie. Wayne secured the remainder of the financing from wealthy Texans who insisted the movie be shot in Texas.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 263. In an interview in the UK with Robert Robinson after the movie was finished, Wayne admitted he invested $1.5 million of his own money in The Alamo and believed it was a good investment. Set Replica Alamo mission used for production The movie set, later known as Alamo Village, was constructed near Brackettville, Texas, on the ranch of James T. Shahan. Chatto Rodriquez, the general contractor of the set, built of tarred roads for access to the set from Brackettville. His men sank six wells to provide 12,000 gallons of water each day, and laid miles of sewage and water lines. They also built of horse corrals.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 264. Rodriquez worked with art designer Alfred Ybarra to create the set. Historians Randy Roberts and James Olson describe it as \\"the most authentic set in the history of the movies\\". Over a million-and-a-quarter adobe bricks were formed by hand to create the walls of the former Alamo Mission. The set was an extensive three- quarter-scale replica of the mission, and has been used in 100 other westerns, including other depictions of the battle. It took more than two years to construct. Casting Wayne was to have portrayed Sam Houston, a bit part that would have let him focus on his first major directing effort, but investors insisted he play a leading character. He took on the role of Davy Crockett, handing the part of Houston to Richard Boone.Clark, Donald, & Christopher P. Andersen. John Wayne's The Alamo: The Making of the Epic Film (New York: Carol Publishing Group, 1995) Wayne cast Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie and Laurence Harvey as William Barrett Travis. Harvey was chosen because Wayne admired British stage actors and he wanted \\"British class\\". When production became tense, Harvey spoke lines from Shakespeare in a Texan accent.John Wayne ‚Äî The Man Behind The Myth by Michael Munn, published by Robson Books, 2004 Other roles went to family and close friends of Wayne, including his son Patrick Wayne and daughter Aissa.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 265. The future western songwriter and stuntman Rudy Robbins had a bit role in the film as one of the Tennessee Volunteers. John Wayne had made Rio Bravo (1959) with singer Ricky Nelson in a supporting role to attract teen audiences. It had worked, so he hired Frankie Avalon to perform a similar function. According to Avalon, \\"Wayne had seen some of the rushes from Timberland and thought I would be right.\\" After making the film, Wayne told the press \\"We're not cutting one bit of any scene in which Frankie appears. I believe he is the finest young talent I've seen in a long time.\\" \\"Mr. Wayne said I was natural as far as acting goes\\", said Avalon. Several days after filming began, Widmark complained he had been miscast and tried to leave. Among other things, it seemed ridiculous that the relatively diminutive (5'9\\") Widmark would be playing the \\"larger than life\\" Bowie, who was a reported 6'6\\". After threats of legal action, he agreed to finish the picture.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 266. During the filming he had Burt Kennedy rewrite his lines.pp. 146-147 Joyner, C. Courtney Burt Kennedy Interview in The Westerners: Interviews with Actors, Directors, Writers and Producers McFarland, 14/10/2009 Avalon says: \\"There may have been some conflict with Widmark in portraying the role that he did, but I didn't see any of that. All I know is he was tough to work for without a doubt because he [Wayne] wanted it his way and he wanted professionalism. He wanted everybody to know their lines and be on their mark and do what he wanted them to do.\\"Beach movies were all about pretty girls: [Final Edition] TIANEN, DAVE. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Milwaukee, Wis. [Milwaukee, Wis] 03 Nov 2002: 2A. Sammy Davis, Jr. asked Wayne for the part of a slave, for he wanted to break out of performing song and dance. Some producers blocked the move, apparently because Davis was dating white actress May Britt. Direction Wayne's mentor John Ford showed up uninvited and attempted to exert undue influence on the film. Wayne sent him off to shoot unnecessary second-unit footage in order to maintain his own authority. Virtually nothing of Ford's footage was used, but Ford erroneously is described as an uncredited co-director.Clark, Donald, & Christopher P. Andersen. John Wayne's The Alamo: The Making of the Epic Film, Carol: 1995 According to many people involved in the film, Wayne was an intelligent and gifted director despite a weakness for the long-winded dialogue of James Edward Grant, his favorite screenwriter. Roberts and Olson describe his direction as \\"competent, but not outstanding\\".Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 268. Widmark complained that Wayne would try to tell him and other actors how to play their parts which sometimes went against their own interpretation of characters. Filming Filming began on September 9, 1959. Some actors, notably Frankie Avalon, were intimidated by rattlesnakes. Crickets were everywhere, often ruining shots by jumping on actors' shoulders or chirping loudly. A bit player, LeJean Ethridge, died in a domestic dispute during filming, and Wayne was called to testify at an inquest. Harvey forgot that a firing cannon has a recoil; during the scene in which, as Travis, he fires in response to a surrender demand, the cannon came down on his foot, breaking it -- he didn't scream in pain until after Wayne had called \\"Cut!\\". Wayne praised his professionalism. Filming ended on December 15. A total of 560,000 feet of film was produced for 566 scenes. Despite the scope of the filming, it lasted only three weeks longer than scheduled. By the end of development, the film had been edited to three hours and 13 minutes.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 269. Music The score was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, and most famously featured the song \\"The Green Leaves of Summer\\", with music by Tiomkin and lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. The song was performed on the soundtrack by The Brothers Four whose rendition reached #65 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; it has been covered by many artists. Another well known song from this film is \\"Ballad of the Alamo\\" (with Paul Francis Webster), which was performed on the soundtrack by Marty Robbins.William R. Chemerka, Allen J. Wiener: Music of the Alamo. Bright Sky Press, 2009. p. 118, 151 Frankie Avalon released a cover version as did the folk duo Bud & Travis whose rendition (with \\"The Green Leaves of Summer\\" on the flip side) reached #64 on the Billboard chart. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. The original soundtrack album has been issued on Columbia Records, Var√®se Sarabande, and Ryko Records. In 2010, a complete score containing recorded versions of Tiomkin's music was issued on Tadlow Music/Prometheus Records, as conducted by Nic Raine and played by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. This release contains previously unreleased material. Release Wayne hired publicist Russell Birdwell to coordinate the media campaign. Birdwell convinced seven states to declare an Alamo Day and sent information to elementary schools around the United States to assist in teaching about the Alamo.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 272. In 1960, the world premiere was held at the Woodlawn Theatre in San Antonio, Texas. Themes=Historical accuracy The film does little to explain the causes of the Texas Revolution or why the battle took place.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 270. Alamo historian Timothy Todish said \\"there is not a single scene in The Alamo which corresponds to a historically verifiable incident.\\" Historians James Frank Dobie and Lon Tinkle demanded their names be removed as historical advisors.Todish et al. (1998), p. 188. Politics Wayne's daughter Aissa wrote \\"I think making The Alamo became my father's own form of combat. More than an obsession, it was the most intensely personal project in his career.\\"Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 271. Many of Wayne's associates agreed that the film was a political platform for Wayne. Many of the statements that his character made reflected Wayne's anti- communist views. To be sure, there is an overwhelming theme of freedom and the right of individuals to make their own decisions. One may point to a scene in which Wayne, as Crockett, remarks: \\"Republic. I like the sound of the word. Means that people can live free, talk free, go or come, buy or sell, be drunk or sober, however they choose. Some words give you a feeling. Republic is one of those words that makes me tight in the throat.\\" The film draws elements from the Cold War environment in which it was produced. According to Roberts and Olson, \\"the script evokes parallels between Santa Anna's Mexico and Khruschchev's Soviet Union as well as Hitler's Germany. All three demanded lines in the sand and resistance to death.\\" Many of the minor characters, at some point during the film, speak about freedom and/or death, and their sentiments may have reflected Wayne's own viewpoint. Response Though the film had a large box-office take, its cost kept it from being a success, and Wayne lost his personal investment. He sold his rights to United Artists, which had released it, and it made back its money. Critical response was mixed, from the New York Herald Tribune's four-star \\"A magnificent job...Visually and dramatically, The Alamo is top-flight,\\" to Time magazine's \\"flat as Texas.\\"quoted in Ashford, Gerald. On the Aisle, San Antonio Express and News, November 5, 1960, p. 16-A The film has a score of 52% on Rotten Tomatoes from 21 reviews.The Alamo - Rotten Tomatoes The film is thought to have been denied awards because Academy voters were alienated by an overblown publicity campaign, particularly one Variety ad claiming that the film's cast was praying harder for Chill Wills to win his award than the defenders of the Alamo prayed for their lives before the battle. The ad, placed by Wills, reportedly angered Wayne, who took out an ad of his own deploring Wills's tastelessness. In response to Wills's ad, claiming that all the voters were his \\"Alamo Cousins,\\" Groucho Marx took out a small ad which simply said \\"Dear Mr. Wills, I am delighted to be your cousin, but I voted for Sal Mineo‚Äù (Wills's rival nominee for Exodus).Levy, Emanuel. Oscar Scandals: Chill Wills http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=822 Wayne provided a clip of the film for use in How the West Was Won. Despite being anachronistic (How the West Was Won begins in 1839 and the Alamo fell in 1836), the clip occurs near the beginning of the second half of the film, as Spencer Tracy narrates the events that led up to the American Civil War. Awards and honors The Alamo won the Academy Award for Best Sound (Gordon E. Sawyer and Fred Hynes) and was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Chill Wills), Best Cinematography (Color), Best Film Editing (Stuart Gilmore), Best Music (Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture) (Dimitri Tiomkin), Best Music (Song) (Dimitri Tiomkin and Paul Francis Webster for The Green Leaves of Summer), and Best Picture (John Wayne, producer). Its successful bid for several Oscar nominations over such films as Psycho (which reviewed four nominations) and Spartacus (which received six) was largely due to intense lobbying by producer John Wayne.Dirks, Tim. http://www.filmsite.org/aa60.html Dimitri Tiomkin won the best original score Golden Globe award. The movie was selected by the National Board of Review as one of the year's 10 best films. The picture won the Bronze Wrangler award as the best theatrical motion picture of the year from the Western Heritage Awards. Different versions The Alamo premiered at its 70 mm roadshow length of 202 minutes, including overture, intermission, and exit music, but was cut severely for wide release. UA re-edited it to 167 minutes. The 202-minute version was believed lost until Bob Bryden, a Canadian fan, realized he had seen the full version in the 1970s. He and Alamo collector Ashley Ward discovered the last known surviving print of the 70 mm premiere version in Toronto. It was pristine. MGM (UA's sister studio) used this print to make a digital video transfer of the roadshow version for VHS and LaserDisc release. The print was taken apart and deteriorated in storage. By 2007, it was unavailable in any useful form. MGM used the shorter, general release version for subsequent DVD releases. At present, the only existing version of the original uncut roadshow release is on standard definition 480i digital video. It is the source for broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies. The best available actual film elements are of the 35 mm negatives of the general release version. A restoration of the deteriorating print found in Toronto, supervised by Robert A. Harris, was envisaged but to date is not underway. The endangered version is the 70 mm uncut roadshow version (202 min). The cut 167-minute version still exists in decent condition in 35 mm. In 2014, an Internet campaign was formed urging MGM to restore The Alamo from the deteriorating 70mm elements. This garnered some publicity from KENS-TV in San Antonio, and attention from filmmakers such as J.J. Abrams, Matt Reeves, Rian Johnson, Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuar√≥n, and Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu. In his 2014 biography of Wayne, John Wayne: The Life and Legend author Scott Eyman states that the full-length Toronto print has deteriorated to the point where it is now unusable.Eyman, Scott.

They were known to their Northern Paiute cousins as Wea Dukadu (\\"Acorn Eaters\\").Northern Paiute Language Project The Ahwahnechee people's heritage can be found all over Yosemite National Park.Fragnoli, D. (2004). Naming yosemite. ATQ (The American Transcendental Quarterly), 18(4), 263. History Traces of human habitation in the valley go back to as long about 3,000 years. Mariposa Phase settlements, which show archaeological continuity with the historical Ahwahnechee, appear from about 800 years ago.Wuerthner, George (1994). Yosemite: A Visitors Companion. Stackpole Books, p. 13  Early Settler Colonialism  Presence of the Ahwahnechee was first recorded by white people in the context of the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th century. In 1850 a settler named James D. Savage set up a mining camp down below the valley, and spent most of his time mining for gold and trading with the few other white men in the area. He stole several Indian women and took them as \\"wives\\" and developed influential relations with the nearby natives. After taken indigenous women, later that year, Savage's camp and post were attacked by the Ahwahnechee, who raided his supplies, and killed two of his men in a likely attempt to free their community members. This, in turn, sparked the Mariposa Indian War of 1850 to 1851. In 1851, during the Mariposa War, California State Militia troops of the Mariposa Battalion burned Ahwahnechee villages and took their food stores in an act of war and genocide.Mazel, 100 The state militia with Savage as their major and the Indian Commissioners from Washington were called out to either force the natives to sign treaties. Six tribes made agreements with the government to accept reservation land further down into the foothills. One of the tribes that refused to meet was the Ahwahnechees. When the soldiers, led by Savage, moved towards their camp to force them out, their chief, Teneiya, finally appeared alone and attempted to conceal the location and number of his people. Major Savage told Teneiya that he would travel to the valley to find them. Chief Teneiya said that he would go back and return with his tribe. When the chief appeared again Savage noticed that there were very few of the natives present. He asked the chief where the rest of his people were, and Teneiya denied having any more people than were there at the moment. Savage was convinced that if he found the rest of the tribe he could persuade them to come with him back to the negotiations. The Major kidnapped some of the men, taking them with him to the north through the mountains and came upon the valley. This was the first entry into Yosemite Valley by any white men. Camping that night, the men debated what to call the valley they had just discovered. They agreed upon the name that the white men had already called the tribe, Yosemite. The date was March 25, 1851.Bingaman, John W. The Ahwahnechees: A Story of Yosemite Indians. 1966. October 2014. . Once they reached the village of Teneiya's people a search was made but no more Indians were found there or in the valley at all. The soldiers returned to the meeting place but Chief Teneiya and the part of the tribe that was already in their custody escaped and returned to the mountains. That May, a second expedition of militia travelled north to capture the chief and his band. Only a few indigenous people, among them two of Chief Teneiya's sons, were found. The chief was eventually brought in to find that his sons had been shot for trying to escape. Within a few days, the chief also tried to escape by jumping into the river. After the recapture of Chief Teneiya, the rest of the band was found and brought to the Fresno reservation in the foothills. They then petitioned for their freedom to return to their mountain home and returned to their secluded valley of ‚ÄúAhwahnee.‚Äù In 1852, a Mariposa expedition of US federal troops heard a report that Ahwahnechee Indians killed two European- American miners at Bridalveil Meadows. Soldiers were again dispatched and the troops executed five Ahwahnechee men.Mazel, 98-99 Later, the tribe fled over the mountains to shelter with a neighboring people, the Mono tribe. They stayed the year and then returned to their native valley.  Later history  Chief Teneiya (d. 1853) was a leader in Yosemite Valley. His father was Ahwahnechee.L. H. Bunnell: Discovery of Yosemite: Chapter XVIII. (retrieved 8 Dec 2009) He led his band away from Yosemite to settle with Paiutes in eastern California.Mazel, 99 Teneiya has descendants living today. The official canon says that the Ahwahnechee of Yosemite \\"became extinct\\" as a people in the 19th century; however, the US federal government has evicted Yosemite Native people from the park in 1851, 1906, 1929, and 1969.Mazel, 162 Jay Johnson, an Ahwahnechee leader in the Mariposa Indian Council, hopes to get federal recognition for Yosemite Indians. Plant use The Ahwahnechee performed controlled burns in the Yosemite Valley that controlled undergrowth and maintained the oak population. Acorns were a central staple to their diet. Black oak acorns provided almost 60% of their diet.Schaffer, Jeffrey P. \\"The Living Yosemite‚ÄìThe Ahwahnechee.\\" 100 Yosemite Hikes. (retrieved 8 Dec 2009) These acorns were taken out of a big stash and lain on a slab of rock in the sun to dry. Once they had dried, the acorns were ground up in small holes atop big granite slabs also called a mortar and pestal. Once they had been sufficiently ground down to a fine powder, the acorn ‚Äúflour‚Äù was put into a shallow depression at the edge of the river. This depression was lined, often with nearby ferns, to keep the acorn powder from being lost in the sand. Rocks were then heated in a fire and placed into the small depression with the acorn flour to heat and potentially boil the bitter taste out, to make it more palatable. When soaked and edible, the flour, now turned to a mush due to the water, was taken out and put into willow cooking baskets. It was heated over a fire, and consumed either as a mush, or baked into a flat bread.Wilson, Herbert Earl. The Lore and Lure of Yosemite. n.d. National Park Service naturalist, Will Neely created a list of the plants commonly used by the Ahwahnechee. Black oak, sugar pine, western juniper, canyon live oak, interior live oak, foothill pine, buckeye, pinyon pine nuts provided acorns and seeds for food. Other plants provided smaller seeds. Mariposa tulip, golden brodiaea, common camas, squaw root, and Bolander's yampah provided edible bulbs and roots. Greens eaten by the Ahwahnechee included broad-leaved lupine, common monkey flower, nude buckwheat, California thistle, miner's lettuce, sorrel, clover, umbrella plant, crimson columbine, and alum root. Strawberry, blackberry, raspberry, thimbleberry, wild grape, gooseberry, currant, blue elderberry, western choke cherry, Sierra plum, and greenleaf manzanita provided berries and fruits. The Ahwahnechee brewed drinks from whiteleaf manzanita and western juniper. Commonly used medicine plants included Yerba santa, yarrow, giant hyssop, Brewer's angelica, sagebrush, showy milkweed, mountain dogbane, balsamroot, California barberry, fleabane, mint, knotweed, wild rose, meadow goldenrod, mule ears, pearly everlasting, and the California laurel. The tribe used soap plant and meadow rue to make soap. They used fibers from Mountain dogbane, showy milkweed, wild grape, and soap plant for cordage. Baskets were woven from splints of American dogwood, big-leaf maple, buckbrush, deer brush, willow, and California hazelnut Additional bracken fern would add black colors to the basket and redbud would provide red. The tribe made bows from incense-cedar, and Pacific dogwood. They built homes from Incense-cedar. Dwellings The people lived in camps at the bottom of the valley, in huts known as o-chum. These small homes were built with pine for the framing and supports, using the wood in a teepee like structure with a diameter of about twelve feet. For the insulation of the homes, cedar bark was used to cover the pine poles to create a sturdy and durable covering for the family housed inside. There were two openings in the huts: One was big enough to be used as an entrance, and the latter is a small opening at the top of the teepee to allow some ventilation for smoke. A small fire was built in the colder months, and easily kept the dwellers warm. These o-chums were able to provide housing to a family of six. To make the bedding, the natives would often use the skins of the animals that they shared the land with. The mattress was made from the skins of bigger animals such as bears and deer. And the blanket was made from the skins of smaller animals, cut into strips and woven together for extra warmth. Another sort of building that the Ahwahnechees often used was a sweat house. These structures were somewhat similar to the o-chum except for the fact that the top, instead of being at a point, was rounded and the entire structure was covered with mud. The sweat houses were used by the young hunters, before they went on a trip, to rid their bodies of the human smell that could betray their presence to the prey. And provided the men with a way to relax and cleanse themselves for religious and health purposes. Hunting When it came to game, the natives had a wide range of quarry. They hunted everything from deer and large game, to worms and small insects. The animals provided much more than just food. They provided skins for clothing, sinew for tying, and other purposes. The whole animal was used in some way, with little waste. Whatever meat that was not eaten right away was hung to dry and made into jerky for later consumption. The braves went on hunting trips that could take days or even weeks, trying to get enough to take back to the tribe without diminishing the future game supply. Ahwahnechee place names Some Ahwahnechee tribal names for areas around Yosemite Valley include the following: * Ahwahne: Yosemite Valley * Tissaack (Tis-se'-yak): Half Dome (South Dome) - meaning ‚ÄúFace of a Young Woman Stained with Tears‚Äù for the dark vertical dripping stripes of lichensMy Yosemite: A Guide for Young Adventurers, Mike Graf * Loya: Sentinel Rock * Tutocanula or Tutockahnulah: El Capitan * Ahwiyah: Mirror Lake * Patillima or Ernating Lawootoo: Glacier Point * Pohono: Bridalveil Fall * Piwyack: Tenaya Lake * Yonapah: Vernal Fall * Yowihe: Nevada Fall * Mahtah: Liberty CapJackson, Helen Hunt. \\"Bits of Travel at Home (1878).\\" Yosemite Online Library.

He produced albums for artists including Rush, Kevin Ayers, Tina Turner, Howard Jones, Saga, The Fixx, Bob Geldof, Thompson Twins, Stevie Nicks, Chris de Burgh, Suzanne Vega, Underworld, Duncan Sheik, Formula and Eleanor McEvoy. He also recorded eleven albums, including those billed under his own name, the pseudo-band name Thinkman, and as a member of the band Quantum Jump. Biography Hine was born in Wimbledon, London on 21 September 1947. In the early 1960s, Hine formed half of the folk duo Rupert & David. The duo performed in pubs and clubs and occasionally shared the stage with a then-unknown Paul Simon. The duo's one released single (on the Decca label in 1965) was a cover of Simon's \\"The Sound of Silence\\". The single was not a success, but was notable for featuring a young Jimmy Page on guitar and Herbie Flowers on bass. Hine released two albums under his own name in the early 70s: Pick Up a Bone (1971) and Unfinished Picture (1973). In 1973, Hine, along with guitarist Mark Warner, bassist John G. Perry (then of Caravan) and drummer Trevor Morais (formerly of The Peddlers) formed the band Quantum Jump, releasing two albums, Quantum Jump (1976) and Barracuda (1977). After a re- release of the track \\"Lone Ranger\\" (from Quantum Jump) became an unexpected UK Top Ten hit in 1979, a third album ‚Äì Mixing, a reworking of tracks selected from the first two Quantum Jump albums ‚Äì was released. After Quantum Jump disbanded, Hine released a trilogy of albums under his own name, including Immunity (1981); Waving Not Drowning (1982); and The Wildest Wish to Fly (1983). The American release of Wildest Wish dropped two tracks, radically reworked two others and incorporated two tracks from 1981's Immunity ‚Äì including \\"Misplaced Love\\", which featured a guest vocal by Marianne Faithfull and had been a minor hit in Australia, reaching number 14 on the chart. In 1985, Hine wrote and produced much of the soundtrack for the black comedy film Better Off Dead. In 1994, Hine released The Deep End. In 1995 he joined with guitarist Phil Palmer, Paul Carrack, Steve Ferrone and Tony Levin to form the band Spin 1ne 2wo. The group released a self-titled project, made up of rock covers of songs by artists including Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Blind Faith, Steely Dan and Bob Dylan. In 2008, Hine oversaw the direction of the compilation album Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace, and also contributed to it a remixed version of his song, \\"The Heart of the Matter\\" (from The Deep End). In 2008, during the Beijing Olympics, the album was iTunes third most downloaded around the globe. Hine wrote two songs for Le Cheshire Cat et moi, a 2009 CD by Nolwenn Leroy which was produced by Teitur Lassen. In 2011 Rupert Hine, launched Auditorius, a joint music publishing project with BMG Rights Management. In November the same year, following a glowing citation from Bob Geldof, Rupert was honoured by the APRS with a Sound Fellowship Award; presented to recognise special contributions to the 'Art, Science and Business of Recording'. Hine joined Joe Boyd, Clive Green, Bob Ludwig, Jimmy Page and Chris Thomas to receive the award from Sir George Martin, APRS President, who together with an elite group of past recipients; sound and music innovators, including Sir Paul McCartney, Peter Gabriel, Chris Blackwell, also holds a Fellowship Award. In March 2015, Esoteric Recordings (part of Cherry Red Records) issued \\"Unshy on the Skyline\\", a compilation from a trio of albums Hine made between 1981 and 1983, Immunity, Waving Not Drowning and The Wildest Wish to Fly, complemented by the lyrics of poet and artist Jeannette-Th√©r√®se Obstoj, and featuring guest contributions from musicians Robert Palmer, Phil Collins and guitarist Phil Palmer. The album has been re-mastered by Hine's long time friend and sound engineer Stephen W Tayler, who had recorded, mixed and co-produced the original albums. To recognise the Dalai Lama's 80th birthday in July 2015, the Art of Peace Foundation commissioned Hine to produce Songs for Tibet II, to celebrate and honour the Dalai Lama's vision. A follow-up to the Grammy-nominated Songs for Tibet that Hine produced in 2008, artist contributions came from Sting, Peter Gabriel, Lorde, Kate Bush, Elbow, Duncan Sheik, Howard Jones, The Family Crest, Ed Prosek, Of Monsters & Men, Bob Geldof, Crystal Method, Rival Sons, Eleanor McEvoy and Hine himself. On 30 August 2019, Esoteric Recordings (part of Cherry Red Records) issued \\"Fighting Apathy With Shock\\", a \\"best of\\" chosen by Hine from his Thinkman project, the albums The Formula (1986), Life Is A Full Time Occupation (1988) and Hard Hat Zone (1990) all with lyrics by Jeannette Obst√∂j (1949-2015). Re-mastering of the collection is by Stephen W Tayler who co-produced the original albums. Although Hine performed nearly all the music himself, there are notable contributions from The Fixx's Jamie West-Oram, Stewart Copeland of The Police and Caf√© Jacques' vocalist Chris Thomson. Followers of Hine's prior projects were intrigued to see him fronting the group: a departure from his earlier solo work. The four-piece, which appeared on television programmes across Europe in support of the record, combined its music with a mission to call out the dangers of the all-too-powerful media. Unusually, and with a finely judged sense of irony, the men who accompanied Hine in public appearances were actors, not musicians (Greg Crutwell, Andy Baker and Julian Clary). And Thinkman was not a real band at all. By the time the last album was released the band's message had shifted away from media topics and onto environmental issues (the track \\"Take Them to the Traitors' Gate\\", was dedicated to Prince Charles) and a new team of supporting players were deployed for appearances; the line-up included Karl Hyde and Rick Smith of Underworld. Hine died at his home in Wiltshire on 4 June 2020 at the age of 72.

It is located in Venustiano Carranza borough east of downtown Mexico City. It lies along Lines 1 and 4. Name and iconography The station logo depicts a swimming duck. Its name and logo come from the surrounding neighbourhood of La Candelaria de los Patos (the Spanish word pato means \\"duck\\") where, only a few decades ago, many duck species lived and were bred and sold in a local market. General information Metro Candelaria has a subsidiary name, Metro Palacio Legislativo (\\"Legislative Palace\\"), because of its proximity to the Palacio Legislativo de San L√°zaro used by the Chamber of Deputies (C√°mara de diputados), the lower house of the Mexican Congress. Candelaria is a transfer station, with Line 1 running underground and Line 4 on an elevated surface viaduct. The station features an in-corridor cultural display. The Line 1 platform for the station was opened on 5 September 1969, and the Line 4 platform was opened on 29 August 1981. Service from Candeleria to Santa Anita started on 25 May 1982. This station has the only \\"Lost and Found\\" office in the entire Metro system.

It was produced by BBC Films and Revolution Films. It is a dystopic science fiction love story exploring the implications of current trends in biotechnology. The soundtrack was composed by David Holmes under the name \\"Free Association\\". The film was shot on location in Shanghai, Dubai, and Rajasthan, with interiors done on stage in London. The mix of foreign locations was chosen because the juxtaposition of elements in these cities offered a believable futuristic setting. Plot In the near future the world is divided between those who live \\"inside\\", in high- density cities, and the poor underclass who live \\"outside.\\" Access to the cities is highly restricted and regulated through the use of health documents, known as \\"papeles\\" in the global pidgin language of the day (composed of elements of English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Italian, Farsi and Mandarin). Most city residents venture outside only after dark since direct sunlight is now considered hazardous to their health (UV rays can cause melanoma). However, a few residents still venture outdoors during the day. The government appears to be authoritarian and dystopian.15 Underseen And Overlooked Dystopian Futures In Film. indiewire.com (19 March 2014). Retrieved on 28 August 2020. Society is regulated by various \\"codes\\". The code of the movie title prohibits \\"genetically incestuous reproduction\\", which may occur as a result of the various medical technologies which have become commonplace, such as cloning. William Geld, an insurance fraud investigator, is sent to Shanghai to interview employees at a company known as \\"The Sphinx\\", which manufactures \\"covers\\", ostensibly \\"insurance cover documents\\" but which in fact regulate the movements of people among cities and \\"inside\\" and \\"outside\\". William's assignment is to identify employees who are suspected of forging \\"covers\\". After interviewing numerous Sphinx employees, he identifies a young worker named Maria Gonzalez as the forger. He is able to do this using a genetically engineered \\"empathy virus,\\" which allows him to gain information from people if they voluntarily reveal something about themselves. Maria tells William that she has the same dream each birthday: she is traveling the subway to meet someone she cannot identify. Each birthday she is one station closer to her destination, where she expects to meet the person. William is captivated by her, and instead of turning her over to security, he identifies another employee as the forger. William then meets up with Maria and they begin an affair. Putting complete trust in a man who could have had her arrested, Maria reveals how she was able to smuggle papeles out of her workplace. In a nightclub they meet Damian, a naturalist who longs to travel to Delhi to study bats. He has applied for cover for eight consecutive years but has always been refused. Maria supplies Damian with a papel. William is upset by this and indicates that he should turn Maria over to the authorities, but Maria knows he won't. William explains that there are legitimate reasons why Damian is unable to obtain the proper clearances legally. Maria believes that some risks are worth taking to fulfill one's dreams. Back at her apartment, Maria shows William her \\"memory scrapbook\\" (an electronic booklet that records video from the user's mind), which contains memories of her parents and friends. Other movies show her passing papeles to various people. She thinks they are beautiful and their eyes are full of desire and dreams, and that they have a different look from \\"everyday\\" people. As Maria sleeps, William finds a forged cover in her room and takes it. William's travel cover will expire the next day so he returns home to his family. On the way to the airport, he gives the forged cover to a street vendor at the city's perimeter checkpoint, an act of humanity which could change the vendor's life. Later, he learns that Damian died in Delhi after exposure to a virus to which he had no immunity. William is reprimanded for not discovering the true Sphinx forger. He explains that he had trouble with his empathy virus and requests that someone else be sent, as there may have been an accomplice to the innocent man he fingered as the guilty party. However, he is ordered to deal with the problem and to return to Shanghai. Upon his return William discovers that Maria has gone. Her apartment is abandoned and the only clue is a medical clinic appointment. He visits the clinic and, using his empathic abilities, learns that Maria was pregnant and that the pregnancy was terminated due to a violation of Code 46. William knows that this means Maria is somehow genetically related to him, but he has no idea how. William discovers that Maria has been taken to have her memory of the episode erased. He talks to Maria, but finds her memory of him is gone. He succeeds in getting the clinic to release Maria into his care by telling them she is a witness in his fraud investigation. After she is released, William proves to Maria that she knows him by his intimate knowledge of her and by showing her the memory recording of when she gave Damian the papel, which includes a shot of William. William tells her about the memory erasure and about how he didn't report her for fraud. Maria is disturbed by this information and becomes very distressed. William gives her a sleeping pill and, while she is sleeping, he cuts some hair from her head and takes it to a facility providing instant DNA analysis. There he discovers that Maria is fifty percent genetically related to him, a biological clone of his mother, who was one of a set of twenty-four in-vitro fertilised clones. This knowledge does not affect William's feelings, but instead of going back to Maria he decides to go home to his family. However, when he tries to leave he is not allowed to do so as his 24-hour cover is now expired. William then realises that his only hope of returning home is to get a papel from Maria. He returns to her apartment and tells her about his inability to leave. She agrees to help him. She tells him she must acquire a papel and meet him at the airport later. She goes to work to obtain a papel, but is unable to forge one herself, as she was moved to another area of work, so a co-worker makes the cover for her. While taking a train to meet William she remembers her birthday dream, and that he was the person she is looking for in the dream. She recalls her feelings for him. She meets William, gives him the papel and tells him so. He decides not to leave her. William and Maria then travel to Jebel Ali in the Middle East, which does not require special travel clearance. The two hide out in the old city where they book a room. Here William reveals to Maria that, in addition to the memory wiping, she has been given a virus that induces a terrorising adrenaline rush in response to physical contact with the person who brought about the Code 46 violation. However, Maria still wants to make love with William, so he ties her down to prevent her from fleeing once the adrenaline rush kicks in. Afterward Maria enters a somnambulistic state, also caused by the virus, which forces her to report the further Code 46 violation to the authorities. She is unconscious of this, though William is aware of the virus's reaction. They then rent an old car and travel away to escape the authorities who are tracking them. William crashes the car while avoiding a collision with camels and pedestrians and they are both knocked unconscious. When William awakes in the hospital he finds himself in Seattle with his wife and child. He has no memory of Maria or the Code 46 violation, as all memories of her and their time together have been completely flushed from his mind and replaced with memories of a successful investigation. The authorities had brought William before a tribunal, but decided the empathy virus had affected his judgment. He attempts to use the empathy virus to read his son's thoughts on the drive back from the hospital, but is unable to because the virus was permanently removed, and antibodies implanted to render reinfection impossible. Maria is more severely punished, in effect, by not having her memories of William loving her erased (instead being altered to make them stronger), essentially forced to remember him and exiled to the place she hated the most, the desert, outside of \\"cover\\". Her final words of the film (portrayed through voiceover of the end-of-film events and a montage of her poor, \\"beggar\\" life and existence) are, \\"I miss you.\\" CastThemes=Genetics Critic Roger Ebert comments that the character of Maria Gonzalez \\"suggests ethnic distinctions have been lost in generations of government-supervised DNA matchups\\". Morality There are some connections with the Oedipus myth. The most obvious are the inadvertent mother-son sexual relation and the Sphinx, but also Maria's exile and William's loss of empathy (compare to Oedipus' loss of sight). Carla Meyer, in her review for the San Francisco Chronicle, argues that \\"the film updates a classical premise ‚Äì the struggle for personal freedom ‚Äì by pairing it with ethical and moral quandaries\\". Language Characters in Code 46 frequently use words from a number of languages, especially Spanish, combined with English to communicate with each other. For example, the characters use the Mandarin Chinese \\"Ni Hao\\" (‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºâfor greeting each other, the Spanish \\"palabra\\" for \\"password\\" and \\"afuera\\" for \\"outside\\" (exiled), the Basque word \\"agur\\" for hello, and \\"Khoda Hafez\\" being Farsi for goodbye. There are also words in Italian (e.g. \\"ti amo\\", I love you), in French (e.g. \\"√† bient√¥t\\", see you soon), and Arabic traditional greetings like \\"As-Salamu Alaykum\\" (ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿπŸÑŸäŸÉ; \\"peace be with you\\", but generally meant as \\"hello\\"). The idea is to portray a society that is not only multi-ethnic but also characterized by language fusion with expressions coming from the dominant languages of our present and those that are going to be dominant in our future. In the karaoke club scene, Mick Jones of The Clash sings The Clash song \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go?\\". Earlier in the same scene, a girl singing along with a piano is playing a famous theme of Portugal's traditional genre Fado de Coimbra, named \\"Coimbra Menina e Mo√ßa\\".

Shawinigan Handshake is the epithet given to a chokehold executed on February 15, 1996 by Jean Chr√©tien, then-Prime Minister of Canada, on anti-poverty protester Bill Clennett. The phrase comes from Chr√©tien's birthplace of Shawinigan, Quebec, as the former prime minister often styled himself the \\"little guy from Shawinigan\\". The incident On the day of the incident, Chr√©tien was in Hull (Gatineau), Quebec to commemorate the first National Flag of Canada Day. As Chr√©tien addressed the assembled crowd, anti-poverty activists heckled the Prime Minister over proposed changes to Canada's unemployment insurance program, and, as he made his way to his limousine at the cessation of the ceremonies, Chr√©tien was confronted by Clennett. At that moment, Chr√©tien grabbed Clennett by the back of the neck and chin, forcing Clennett to the ground and breaking one of his teeth.\\"Prescott not the first to pack a punch\\". CNN, May 17, 2001. Another protester who then blocked Chr√©tien's passage had his megaphone knocked away by the Prime Minister, and was promptly pushed to the ground by Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers. Chr√©tien later defended these actions, stating: \\"some people came my way... and I had to go, so if you're in my way....\\" He also blamed the RCMP for allowing Clennett to obtain such close proximity to the Prime Minister, though the RCMP said they saw no breach of security. Chr√©tien also demonstrated a casual attitude towards the affair, later joking that he had used the Shawinigan Handshake because he mistook Clennett for John Nunziata, whom Chr√©tien had dismissed from the Liberal caucus for voting against the 1996 budget. Reform Party Member of Parliament Deborah Grey subsequently nicknamed Chr√©tien \\"The Shawinigan Strangler\\". This sobriquet was later used by other opposition MPs as well; in a member's statement on February 12, 1997, Chuck Strahl sarcastically nominated Chr√©tien for a \\"Parliamentary Oscar\\" for his \\"performance\\" in The Shawinigan Strangler.Statements by Members. Hansard, February 12, 1997. While Clennett did not press charges against the Prime Minister, another person, Kenneth Russell, did accuse Chr√©tien of assault on March 28, and the Prime Minister was formally charged by a judge in the Quebec Superior Court. These charges, however, were rejected by the Attorney General of Quebec. Bill Clennett Bill Clennett has since run for provincial office, standing as a Qu√©bec solidaire candidate in Hull in Quebec's 2007 and 2008 provincial elections.Activist grabbed by Chr√©tien runs for office. cbc.ca, February 23, 2007. Bill Clennett and his team ranked third in 2008 after the Liberal Party of Quebec and the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, beating the Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec, the Quebec Green Party, and the Independence Party. Legacy The label of the \\"Shawinigan Handshake\\" beer, which depicts Chr√©tien strangling Satan in a similar fashion to how he strangled Clennett. The epithet and incident remain enduring popular local lore in Shawinigan, decades after the incident. Following the incident, popular Canadian TV sports personality, Don Cherry, commented that he liked politicians being direct in this manner, and the performance of Chr√©tien in particular. Shawinigan microbrewery Trou du Diable has released an award-winning beer named \\"Shawinigan Handshake\\" with Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien strangling hockey commentator Don Cherry on its label, in honour of the local lore.

It is the American transplant of a famous European yeshiva of the same name. Telshe in Ohio, a prominent Haredi institution of Torah study, also has branches in Chicago and New York. In 1875YIVO says \\"around 1870\\" but 1875 is when it became more than a minor local institution. this famous Eastern European yeshiva was founded in the Lithuanian town of Tel≈°iai (Yiddish: ◊ò◊¢◊ú◊ñ \\"Telz\\"). During World War II the yeshiva began relocating to Wickliffe, Ohio, in the United States and is now known as the Rabbinical College of Telshe, (commonly referred to as Telz Yeshiva or Telz in short.) History Telshe yeshiva building, Tel≈°iai, Lithuania The yeshiva was begun in the town of Tel≈°iai (\\"Telshe\\" in Russian or \\"Telz\\" in Yiddish) to provide for the religious educational needs of young Jewish men in Telshe and its surrounding towns. By 1900 is was \\"one of the three largest yeshivot in Imperial Russia.\\" The yeshiva was established by three important Orthodox rabbis and Talmudists: * Meir Atlas, later the rabbi of Shavli (the Yiddish name for ≈†iauliai) and the father-in-law of Elchonon Wasserman and Chaim Ozer Grodzensky; * Zvi Yaakov Oppenheim and, who later became the rabbi of Kelm; * Shlomo Zalman Abel, the brother-in-law of Shimon Shkop. They received financial assistance from a Jewish banker in Berlin, Mr. Ovadyah Lachman. Rabbi Eliezer Gordon Rabbi Eliezer Gordon In 1883, Eliezer Gordon was appointed as the (head rabbi) of the town of Telz and in 1884, rosh yeshiva (dean) of the yeshiva. A student of Yisrael Salanter, he was a brilliant Talmudist and expert in Torah law who had appointed by Rabbi Salanter as a maggid shiur (lecturer) in Salanter's yeshiva at a young age. Gordon also served as rabbi in Kelm, and for a brief time in Slabodka (a suburb of Kaunas/Kovno known in Lithuanian as Viliampole). Although Rabbi Salanter strongly held that everyone required mussar study, he made an exception for Rav Laizer. Gordon was not satisfied with a yeshiva that served only the younger students in Telz and the vicinity. It eventually became one of the largest in Imperial Russia. He added his son-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch to the faculty and in 1885 he acquired the talents of Rabbi Shimon Shkop. Both Bloch and Shkop were innovators in the field of Jewish education, each pioneering new methods and approaches to the study of the Torah (Hebrew Bible), Talmud and Halakha (Jewish law). Together, their methodical formulae set down the foundation for what became known in the world of Torah study as the Telzer Derekh ( the \\"Telzer approach\\"). Innovation brought a rapid increase in the student body. Among them were designating lectures for specific student levels. Whereas other contemporary yeshivas provided one level of study for all students, Telz provided students with lectures commensurate with a student's age and understanding. When a student's standard had advanced, he would advance to the next shiur (class-level). This system was soon integrated into the structure of almost all yeshivas and remains the accepted structure in most yeshivas worldwide. There were five different shiurim at Telz; Rabbi Gordon delivered the highest shiur. Telz was especially noted for its ability to develop its talmidim in lomdus. Rabbi Laizer Yudel Finkel once stated that every talmud student would be best off studying at Telz, where he can develop his learning skills, for two years, and then studying in another yeshiva. The yeshiva eventually outgrew their Telz community-provided building and in 1894 moved into a new facility. That year they added a new subject of study‚Äîmussar (\\"Jewish ethics\\"). Until then the study of mussar was a students' personal prerogative; now, it was a part of the yeshiva curriculum. A new faculty position was created: mussar mashgiach (teacher of ethics). Telz's first mussar mashgiach was Rabbi Ben Zion Kranitz, a student of Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv. Kranitz was mild mannered, and did not force his students to accept the mussar approach. In 1897, however, Rabbi Gordon engaged a new mussar mashgiach‚Äîthe dynamic Rabbi Leib Chasman, who instituted a very strict mussar regime in the yeshiva. Many students opposed this approach. Chasman later achieved world renown as the senior mussar mashgiach at the Hebron Yeshiva in Jerusalem.Lusch, L., ed., The late Rabbi Leib Chasman, People and Personalities, in The Shtutshin Community In 1902, Rabbi Shimon Shkop left to become the rabbi of Breinsk, Lithuania. In 1905 Rabbi Chaim Rabinowitz joined the yeshiva to fill this void. Rabinowitz had served as rabbi to the town of Meishad, and later as a maggid shiur (\\"lecturer\\") at the Knesses Beis Yitzchak yeshiva in Kovno, Lithuania. As with his predecessor, Rabinowitz innovated a unique style of Talmudic analysis. In 1910, while fundraising for the yeshiva in London, Rabbi Gordon suffered a heart attack and died. He had stamped his imprint onto the lives of hundreds of young men. Among his students, now rabbis, were: Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, Elchonon Wasserman, Zvi Pesach Frank, Yehezkel Abramsky and others who in turn left their imprint on Jewish society and culture. Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch Rabbi Gordon's 1910 passing saw his son-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch assuming the mantle of leadership as both rabbi to the community and rosh yeshiva. Not only was Bloch an innovator in the realms of Talmudic analysis, he also possessed a unique approach to Torah study and Jewish philosophy. In 1920, he established in Telz primary schools for both boys and girls, and also added a mechina (\\"preparatory school\\") to the yeshiva. Previously, older students would tutor younger students who entered the yeshiva but were not up to the standard of the lowest class. The mechina was structured in the same fashion as the yeshiva itself with four levels of classes commensurate with the different levels of student advancement. At the time, the notion of a yeshiva possessing its own preparatory school was novel. Today, however, it has become an accepted norm, something Rabbi Bloch pioneered. Parallel to an easier version of the yeshiva curriculum, the mechina also featured secular studies, another innovation at the time. This was cause for opposition from the ranks of many rabbis, who were unaccustomed to the idea of secular studies occupying a position in any form of yeshiva. In 1924, however, the Lithuanian government announced its decision to accredit only those rabbinical colleges that possessed a secular studies department. The Rabbinical College of Telshe was the only such institute, although secular studies were only in its mechina. A kollel (\\"postgraduate institute\\") began in 1922, to train graduates for the rabbinate. Admission required that a student display great promise. Bloch's son-in-law Chaim Mordechai Katz served as dean (rosh hakollel). =Yavneh= In 1918, a teachers training institute had been established in Kovno; however, the seminary did not achieve much success. The faculty of the academy turned to Rabbi Bloch, renowned for his pedagogical prowess, to take it over, and, in 1925 The Yavneh School for the Training of Teachers reopened in Telz under the auspices of The Rabbinical College of Telshe. This served as a postgraduate institute, with the charter of producing teachers for Jewish schools. The curriculum at the teacher's institute included educational skills, Hebrew Bible, Talmud, the Hebrew language and literature and mathematics. The school succeeded in supplying qualified and trained teachers of a high caliber not only to the communities of Lithuania, but also to those of greater Europe. Yavneh Girls High School Building in Telz, Lithuania. For many years the Jewish community in Lithuania had lacked a structured educational system for teenage girls. Rabbi Bloch felt that such a concept was called for and in 1927 a high school department for girls was established in Telshe. The school found immediate praise and support from many rabbis and community leaders who saw the immense value that such an institute had to offer. In 1930, a sister institute to The Yavneh Teacher's Training Institute was opened by Rabbi Joseph Leib Bloch of Telz, who hired Kovno-born Dr. Yitzhak Raphael Etzion (Holzberg) to run it. The school offered a two-year course to young women who wished to enter the field of education. Like its male counterpart, the female division of the Yavneh school succeeded in producing many high quality teachers who branched out across Europe. See also: Sarah Schenirer #Teacher's Seminary; Seligman Baer Bamberger's Bais Medrash L'Morim. =Bloch legacy= These various schools were all incorporated as a part of The Rabbinical College of Telshe. Thus, under Rabbi Bloch's leadership, the yeshiva grew to include young primary school students through to qualified professionals, ready to embark on careers in the rabbinate and Jewish education. A committee was established for the publication of the lectures (shiurim) delivered in the yeshiva and subsequently, the lectures of Rabbi Bloch and Rabbi Rabinowitz were circulated and studied in other yeshivas. The popular acceptance of their novellae in the yeshiva world today, is due much to their circulation in the pre-Holocaust yeshiva world. In October 1930, Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch died, and his second oldest son, Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Bloch succeeded him as both Rabbi to the community and rosh yeshiva. Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Bloch Students of Telshe on Purim 1936. At the time of Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch's passing, his son Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Bloch was only 38 years old; however, he had been lecturing in the yeshiva since 1926 and had already acquired a name as one of the greatest minds in the rabbinic world. Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Bloch's two brothers: Rabbi Zalman Bloch and Rabbi Eliyahu Meir Bloch also occupied positions within the yeshiva. All remained dedicated to continuing with their father's educational methods and approach. In 1931, a committee was established to maximize traditional Jewish education to as many Jewish children as possible. Schools were made in small towns where there had previously been little or no structured schooling. Older students in the yeshiva were selected to teach for periods of time at these schools, following which, they would return to continue their studies at the yeshiva. Beyond providing many communities with new educational options, these schools also gave Telzer students another opportunity for self-development and growth. Rabbi Chaim Rabinowitz died a year and a day after the death of Yosef Leib Bloch. Rabinowitz's son, Rabbi Azriel Rabinowitz, a mere age 26, was appointed as a rosh yeshiva. In 1933, the yeshiva built a new building to house the mechina (\\"preparatory school\\"). Until the onset of World War II, the yeshiva continued to offer traditional Jewish education to all ages. The establishment of schools outside of Telz had furthered this goal. The Holocaust In the Fall of 1939, the Russians were allowed to bring troops into Lithuania on the pretext of defending the country. In June 1940, the Russians seized control of the country and quickly transformed it into a \\"soviet socialist republic.\\" As part of this transformation, private Jewish organizations and schools were disbanded and the yeshiva was closed. Most of the students dispersed, with only about a hundred students remaining in Telshe. The learning was done in groups of 20-25 students, studying in various batai medrashim (\\"small synagogues\\") led by the rosh yeshivas. During the early years of World War II, Rabbi Elya Meir Bloch and Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz were in the United States on a fund-raising mission. As the war broke out, their only option to ensure the continuity of the Yeshiva was to transfer the whole yeshiva to American soil. In October 1940, a group of students led by Rabbi Chaim Stein escaped from war-ravaged Lithuania as it was overrun by the Nazis. This daring flight took place on the Sabbath. While travel is ordinarily prohibited on the Sabbath, one must transgress this prohibition in order to save lives and escape great peril. The original faculty, their families and most of the student body who chose to be left behind in Europe, were killed in Lithuania by Nazi forces and Lithuanian collaborators. Escaping to Russia as the war ravaged Eastern Europe, another war was taking place in the Pacific - the very direction that the students led by Rabbi Chaim Stein were headed. The students achieved safe passage via the Trans-Siberian Railroad to the Far East. The group had somehow acquired visas from the renowned Chiune Sugihara, and became beneficiaries of his admirable action to risk his life to enable people from war-torn Europe seek refuge elsewhere in the world. Shortly after, the students traveled to Australia. Since some of the students that British subjects in possession of British passports, such as Rabbi Shlomo Davis, their visas were granted. Upon arrival in Australia, they were greeted by the small but vibrant Jewish community in Brisbane. As they planned out their next course of action, the group of students reached out to improve the Jewish quality of life in the local Jewish community. Among this group was Rabbi Chaim Stein, who later became Rosh Yeshiva in Wickliffe, Ohio, Rabbi Shlomo Davis who became a teacher and later a senior administrator for the students registrar (retired and living in Lakewood, New Jersey), and Rabbi Nosson Meir Wachtfogel, who later became mashgiach ruchani of Beth Medrash Gevoha in Lakewood, New Jersey. The local Jewish community, afraid that these scholars would cause a flourishing of orthodoxy, paid for their transit to the US. This group found their way to the United States in early 1941.1941: Once reunited with their Roshei Yeshiva, Rabbi Elya Meir Bloch and Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz, they eventually settled in Cleveland, Ohio. Telshe in the United States The yeshiva was opened in Cleveland in the house of Yitzchak & Sarah Feigenbaum on November 10, 1941. As of 1954, it became officially titled the Rabbinical College of Telshe. They relocated to the present Wickliffe location in 1957. Telshe consists of a high school, college and post-graduate school. The yeshiva is a non-profit and is accredited through the Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools. The yeshiva has a department of secular studies that grants a high school diploma. In the United States, the yeshiva was initially led by a faculty including the late Rabbis Elya Meir Bloch, Chaim Mordechai Katz, Boruch Sorotzkin, Mordechai Gifter, Chaim Stein, Aizik Ausband, and Pesach Stein. When R'Mordechai Gifter died in 2001, his son Zalman, a rabbi and graduate of Telshe, \\"took over the yeshiva.\\" The 2013 student count of 130 included 80 in grades 9-12; the highest student count, in 1966, was about 425. Notable alumni Among the well-known alumni of the yeshiva are: * Ezriel Carlebach (1909‚Äì1956), Israeli journalist and editorial writer * Rabbi Naftoli Carlebach, Orthodox Jewish rabbi and accountant * Rabbi Nachum Zev Dessler, Cleveland, Ohio * Rabbi Azriel Goldfein, founding Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivah Gedolah of Johannesburg * Rabbi Chaim Dov Keller, Chicago, Illinois.

In 1960, the yeshiva opened a branch in Chicago, Illinois. Within 10 years the branch in Chicago became independent of the yeshiva in Cleveland and no longer has an official formal connection to the yeshiva in Cleveland, although informal ties remain close. * Kiryat Ye'arim (Telz-Stone), Israel. In 1977 Rabbi Mordechai Gifter brought a group of 20 students from Cleveland to open a branch of the yeshiva in Kiryat Ye'arim (Telz-Stone), Israel. Classes took place in several apartments. In 1979, when Rabbi Baruch Sorotzkin died, Rabbi Gifter was asked to return to Cleveland and the Israeli branch closed.Rose, Binyamin. \\"The Prince of America's Torah Renaissance: An appreciation of Rav Mordechai Gifter, ztz\\"l, on his tenth yahrtzeit\\".

On Friday, 16 December 1960 a United Airlines Douglas DC-8, bound for Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport) in New York City, collided in midair with a TWA Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation descending into the city's LaGuardia Airport. The Constellation crashed on Miller Field in Staten Island and the DC-8 into Park Slope, Brooklyn, killing all 128 people on the two aircraft and six people on the ground. It was the deadliest aviation disaster in the world at the time. The death toll would not be surpassed until a Lockheed C-130B Hercules was shot down in May 1968, killing 155 people. In terms of commercial aviation, the death toll would not be surpassed until the March 1969 crash of Viasa Flight 742, which crashed on takeoff and killed all 84 people on board the aircraft, as well as 71 people on the ground. The accident became known as the Park Slope plane crash or the Miller Field crash, after the crash sites of each plane respectively. The accident was also the first hull loss and first fatal accident involving a Douglas DC-8. Aircraft and crews United Airlines Flight 826, Mainliner Will Rogers, registration was a DC-8-11 carrying 84 people from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport) in Queens. The crew was Captain Robert Sawyer (age 46), First Officer Robert Fieberg (40), Flight Engineer Richard Pruitt (30), and four stewardesses. Trans World Airlines Flight 266, Star of Sicily, registration was a Super Constellation carrying 44 people from Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, to LaGuardia Airport in Queens. The crew was Captain David Wollam (age 39), First Officer Dean Bowen (32), Flight Engineer LeRoy Rosenthal (30), and two stewardesses. Star of Sicily's sister ship N6902C, Star of the Seine, was destroyed in another mid-air collision with a United Airlines flight in 1956. Background At 10:21 A.M. Eastern Time, United 826 advised ARINC radio‚Äîwhich relayed the message to UAL maintenance‚Äîthat one of its VOR receivers had stopped working. ATC, however, was not told that the flight had only one receiver, which made it more difficult for the pilots of flight 826 to identify the Preston intersection, beyond which it had not received clearance. At 10:25 A.M. Eastern Time, air traffic control issued a revised clearance for the flight to shorten its route to the Preston holding point (near Laurence Harbor, New Jersey) by . That clearance included holding instructions (a standard race-track holding pattern) for UAL flight 826 when it arrived at the Preston intersection. Flight 826 was expected to reduce its speed before reaching Preston, to a standard holding speed of 210 knots or less. However, the flight was estimated to be doing 301 knots when it collided with the TWA flight, several miles beyond that Preston clearance limit. During the investigation, United claimed the Colts Neck VOR was unreliable (pilots testified on both sides of the issue). (\\"Preston\\" was the point where airway V123 -- the 050-radial off the Robbinsville VOR -- crossed the Solberg 120-degree radial and the Colts Neck 346-degree radial.) However, the CAB final report found no problem with the Colts Neck VOR. The prevailing conditions were light rain and fog (which had been preceded by snowfall).  Collision and ground impacts  According to the DC-8's FDR, the aircraft was off course and for 81 seconds, had descended at while slowing from more than 400 Kts to 301 Kts, at the time of the collision. One of the starboard engines on the DC-8 hit the Constellation just ahead of its wings, tearing apart that portion of the fuselage. The Constellation entered a dive, with debris continuing to fall as it disintegrated during its spiral to the ground. The initial impact tore the engine from its pylon on the DC-8. Having lost one engine and a large part of the right-wing, the DC-8 remained airborne for another minute and a half. The DC-8 crashed into the Park Slope section of Brooklyn at the intersection of Seventh Avenue and Sterling Place (), scattering wreckage and setting fire to ten brownstone apartment buildings, the Pillar of Fire Church, the McCaddin Funeral Home, a Chinese laundry, and a delicatessen. Six people on the ground were killed.Disaster in Fog ‚Äî New York Times ‚Äî 17 December 1960 The crash left the remains of the DC-8 pointed southeast towards a large open field at Prospect Park, blocks from its crash site. A student at the school who lived in one of the destroyed apartment buildings said his family survived because they happened to be in the only room of their apartment not destroyed. The crash left a trench covering most of the length of the middle of Sterling Place. Occupants of the school thought a bomb had gone off or that the building's boiler had exploded. The TWA plane crashed onto the northwest corner of Miller Field, at , with some sections of the aircraft landing in New York Harbor. At least one passenger fell into a tree before the wreckage hit the ground. There was no radio contact with traffic controllers from either plane after the collision, although LaGuardia had begun tracking an incoming, fast-moving, unidentified plane from Preston toward the LaGuardia \\"Flatbush\\" outer marker.Excerpts of Tape Conversations at Time of Air Crash ‚Äî New York Times ‚Äî 22 December 1960 Investigation The likely cause of the accident was identified in a report by the US Civil Aeronautics Board. Initial survivor The only person to initially survive the crash was an 11-year-old boy from Wilmette, Illinois. He was traveling on Flight 826 unaccompanied as part of his family's plans to spend Christmas in Yonkers with relatives. He was thrown from the plane into a snowbank where his burning clothing was extinguished. Although alive and conscious, he was badly burned and had inhaled burning fuel. He died of pneumonia the next day. Legacy In 2010, on the 50th anniversary of the accident, a memorial to the 134 victims of the two crashes was unveiled in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn. The cemetery is the site of the common grave in which were placed the human remains that could not be identified. The events of the collision are documented in the 5th season 1 episode of The Weather Channel documentary Why Planes Crash. The episode is titled \\"Collision Course\\" and was first aired in April 2013.

The screenplay by Julius J. Epstein is based on the book for the 1954 stage musical of the same title by Logan and S.N. Behrman, which in turn had been adapted from Marcel Pagnol's trilogy. Pagnol wrote two plays, Marius (1929) and Fanny (1931) and completed the cycle by writing and directing a film, C√©sar, in 1936. Meanwhile, Marius (1931) and Fanny (1932) were also produced as films. The film deleted all the songs from Fanny, the musical, but the music by Harold Rome served as the underscore for the soundtrack, and the title tune is used as the Main Title theme. Although it was composed for another medium, it was nominated for both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. Plot C√©sar (Charles Boyer) is a barkeeper in Marseille in the early 1920s. His 18-year-old son Marius (Horst Buchholz) works for him at his bar, but wants nothing more than to go to sea and leave his boring existence behind. The only thing holding him back is Fanny (Leslie Caron), an 18-year-old girl with whom he grew up. Fanny works selling fish with her mother down at the waterfront. Fanny has been in love with Marius her whole life. She flirts with him, but Marius always rejects her. Fanny invites Marius to a Sunday-night dance, but he rejects her once more. Unbeknownst to Fanny, Marius is planning to leave the next day. Encouraged by his friend, the ‚ÄúAdmiral‚Äù (Raymond Bussieres), he has secretly signed on as a sailor on a round-the-world scientific expedition. Offended, Fanny leaves. Meanwhile, elderly merchant Panisse (Maurice Chevalier) asks to meet with Fanny's mother Honorine (Georgette Anys), who believes he wants to propose to her. To Honorine's surprise, Panisses wants to marry Fanny, even though he knows she loves someone else. Although disappointed, Honorine does not object: Panisse is worth 600,000 francs. Fanny tells Marius that she has rejected Panisse's proposal because she loves him and is willing to wait until he returns. Marius tells her he will be away for five years and to forget about him. They declare their love for each other and go to Fanny's house, where they are alone. The following morning, Honorine discovers Fanny and Marius in bed together. She and C√©sar begin to plan their children's wedding, but Fanny urges Marius to leave. She even lies to him, telling him that she would rather marry a rich man like Panisse than him. But, in truth, she is afraid that, eventually, he will grow to hate her for depriving him of this great opportunity. About two months after Marius goes off to sea, Fanny discovers that she is pregnant with his child. She tells Panisse, who is happy to marry her anyway, overjoyed by the possibility of a male heir to carry on his name. They marry, and Fanny gives birth to a boy. C√©sar, knowing the baby's true father, collaborates with Panisse to give the baby the name C√©sario Marius Panisse. On C√©sario's first birthday, Panisse takes the train to Paris on business. While he is gone, Marius returns, on a short leave. He visits Fanny, and upon learning her child is his, apologizes to Fanny. He knows now that she said those things only to make him go. Marius tells her that he wants her back, but C√©sar comes in before anything can happen. Panisse arrives home early. Knowing that Fanny will not leave without the boy, he says that he will not try to stop Fanny from going with Marius, but he will not part with the child. Fanny tells Marius she loves him, but she will not take C√©sario from Panisse. Marius leaves without Fanny or his child. Ten years later, C√©sario (Joel Flateau) is looking forward to his birthday party. After being taken to the waterfront, C√©sario wanders off and meets the Admiral. The Admiral takes the boy sailing without telling anyone and reunites him with Marius, though C√©sario has no idea who Marius is. Marius, who is now working in a garage, is overjoyed to see his son, but when Panisse is told the boy is missing, he is stricken and taken to his room. Fanny is shocked to find C√©sario with his father. She announces that Panisse is dying, and Marius drives them home. When they arrive at the house, Panisse calls for C√©sario to sit with him. Fanny goes outside and talks with Cesar and Marius. Marius expresses his bitterness and announces his plans to leave for the United States the next day. Fanny explains to Marius that she never told him about the baby because on the day he left, she hoped he would turn around and not get on the boat. When he did not, she felt betrayed and angry. Fanny goes in to Panisse. On his deathbed, Panisse dictates a letter asking Marius to marry Fanny and be a father to C√©sario. His only request is that the boy keep the last name, Panisse.

The original film trilogy in French was directed by Alexander Korda (Marius, 1931), Marc All√©gret (Fanny, 1932) and Pagnol himself (C√©sar, 1936). There was a 1933 Italian film named Fanny, the 1934 German film Der Schwarze Walfisch (\\"The Black Whale\\"), and Port of Seven Seas, a 1938 American film directed by James Whale, also based on the trilogy.Hayward, Susan and Vincendeau, Ginette, French Film, Texts and Contexts. London: Routledge 1990. , p. 82 Jack L. Warner purchased the screen rights to the stage musical but, believing that the popularity of movie musicals was on the wane, he decided to eliminate the songs. West Side Story, released the same year as Fanny, proved to be a box office hit.Fanny at Turner Classic Movies The production did benefit significantly from the decision: Charles Boyer, who had refused the role when it involved singing because he would neither sing nor allow his voice to be dubbed, gladly accepted when that was no longer necessary. Boyer and Chevalier, who were old friends, were delighted to be able to work together, at last. Before the picture's release, art house theater owners booked the original films, promoting the showings as the last opportunity to see them before the new picture came out. In fact, Warner's acquisition of the screen rights removed the films from circulation for decades. Plans for the original title, Joshua Logan's Fanny were scrapped when reporters pointed out the double meaning. Screenwriter Julius J. Epstein had collaborated with Joshua Logan on Tall Story the previous year, but he initially declined the director's offer to adapt Fanny for the screen, because he found it difficult to believe Marius' motivation for leaving Marseille. He accepted the assignment after Logan found a solution in Marius' relationship with his father. Epstein relied on Pagnol's plays for inspiration, but retained the ending of the musical, which was quite different from the plot of Pagnol's original film, C√©sar. Some scenes and dialogue are taken directly from the 1938 film. Prior to Warner's decision to film the property as a straight drama, Logan had offered Charles Boyer the role of C√©sar but the actor declined because he felt he could not sing and was unwilling to lip sync to someone else's voice. When the songs were dropped, he accepted the offer. He and Maurice Chevalier, cast as Panisse, were old friends but had never performed together. Both welcomed the opportunity to do so. Audrey Hepburn agreed to portray Fanny but eventually had to decline the role due to prior commitments. Assuming the French would dislike an English language interpretation of the Pagnol plays, Leslie Caron was hesitant to replace her, but she liked the script and accepted three weeks before principal photography began. Among the Marseille locations used for filming were Notre-Dame de la Garde and Vieux Port. Critical reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times observed, \\"Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show, whether partial to music or no, you can't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart. For Mr. Logan, with the aid of expert craftsmen and a cast of principals that we do not believe an act of divine cooperation could have greatly improved upon, has given the charming Marseilles folk play a stunning pictorial sweep, a deliciously atmospheric flavor and a flesh-touching intimacy. And, embraced by these graphic, sensuous virtues are the rich human, comic elements that flowed out of Pagnol's little pictures and glimmered upon the Broadway stage . . . To be sure, there are flaws in the compound. The cutting is often too abrupt, some scenes are confused by intercutting, and the tempo in the early phases is much too fast. Also, occasionally the actors are costumed too prettily, and the domestic magnificence of the Panisses in the last part is tasteless and absurd . . . [But] on the whole, the appropriate atmosphere of Marseilles is literally and colorfully conveyed ‚Äî in excellent color, by the way. Perhaps there will be some prim objection to the lush emotionalism of it all and to the frankness of the musical nudging, but we loved it.\\"New York Times review Nominations * Academy Award for Best Picture * Academy Award for Best Actor (Charles Boyer) * Academy Award for Best Original Score (Harold Rome) * Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Jack Cardiff) * Academy Award for Best Film Editing (William H.

SGPC also administers Darbar Sahib in Amritsar. The SGPC is governed by the chief minister of Punjab. The SGPC manages the security, financial, facility maintenance and religious aspects of Gurdwaras as well as keeping archaeologically rare and sacred artifacts, including weapons, clothes, books and writings of the Sikh Gurus. Bibi Jagir Kaur became the first woman to be elected president of the SGPC for the second time in September 2004. She had held the same post from March 1999 to November 2000. History=Foundation In 1920 the emerging Akali leadership summoned a general assembly of the Sikhs holding all shades of opinion on 15 November 1920 in vicinity of the Akal Takht in Amritsar. The purpose of this assembly was to elect a representative committee of the Sikhs to administer the Harimandir Sahib Complex and other important historical gurdwaras. Two days before the proposed conference the British government set up its own committee consisting of 36 Sikhs to manage the Harimandir Sahib. Sikhs held their scheduled meeting and elected a bigger committee consisting of 175 members and named it Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. The members of the government appointed committee were also included in it. Harbans Singh Attari became vice president and Sunder Singh Ramgarhia became secretary of the committee. By that time Master Tara Singh had started taking interest in Sikh religious affairs. He was one of the 175 members elected to the committee. The formation of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee provided a focal point for the movement for the reformation of Sikh religious places. The Committee began to take over management of gurdwaras one by one, and were resisted by incumbent mahants. Starting in late 1920, a large number of reformers both in urban and rural Punjab had joined to form separate and independent religious orders called jathas. The primary purpose of a jatha was to gain control over local gurdwaras. A jatha under the command of a jathedar would occupy a shrine and try to take over management in its favor from its current incumbents. Sometimes the transfer went peacefully especially in the case of smaller Gurdwaras with less income resources. This was done sometimes with the threat of force. The Sikh leadership was fully aware of the importance of the press for the success of any movement. It enlisted the active support and sympathy of some of the important nationalist papers in the country like 'The Independent', Swaraj (Hindi), The Tribune, Liberal, Kesri (Urdu), Milap (Urdu), Zamindar (Urdu) and Bande Matram (Hindi).Two of the vernacular dailies Akali (Pbi.) and the Akali-te-Pardesi (Urdu), edited by Master Tara Singh also played an important role. It brought the necessary awakening among the Sikh masses and prepared them to undertake the struggle for reform. With the direct and indirect support of the Central Sikh League, the Indian National Congress and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the Shiromani Akali Dal started a non-violent struggle against the government for the control of the Gurdwaras. The reports of some immoral acts perpetrated at Tarn-Taran reached the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee at its meeting on 14 January 1921. A fortnight earlier a local jatha was beaten up and not allowed to perform kirtan at the gurdwara. It decided to send a jatha from Amritsar under Jathedar Teja Singh Bhuchar. Jathedar Kartar Singh Jhabbar with Akalis from 'Khara Sauda Bar' joined him. On 25 January, a group of about forty workers took over the control of Sri Darbar Sahib Tarn-Taran from its Mahant. In the ensuing conflict two Akalis were killed and several others wounded by the henchmen of the Mahants. The Mahants were ousted from the Gurdwara and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee appointed a managing committee. Gurdwaras Act of 1925 In early 1920s, Malcolm Hailey, the governor of the Punjab showed his readiness to assist the Sikhs in taking possession of all the important Gurdwaras in the province through a five-member committee constituted by the Sikh members of the legislative council. Hailey presented a draft of a new Gurdwara Bill to the Akali leaders imprisoned in Lahore fort. Master Tara Singh, Bhag singh Advocate, Gurcharn singh Advocate, Teja Singh Akerpuri(Jathedar AkalTakht Sahib) Sohan Singh Josh and Sardar Teja Singh Samundri studied each clause of the bill carefully. The bill met all the Akali demands and was signed into law on 28 July 1925 by the Viceroy of India after its ratification by the Punjab legislative council. The Act came into force on 1 November 1925 with a gazette notification from the government of Punjab. The Act made a Central Gurdwara Board elected by the Sikhs to be the custodian of all important Sikh places of worship. The first meeting of the Gurdwara board passed a resolution that its designation be changed to Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, which was accepted by the government. Thus ended what came to be known in common parlance as the 'Third Sikh War'. The Punjab government withdrew its orders declaring the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and other Akali organs as unlawful associations and recognized the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee as a representative body of the Sikhs. In making the Punjab government agree to such recognition, the Akali leadership undoubtedly scored a victory over the bureaucracy. The Sikh Gurdwara bill met most of the demands of the Sikhs, but the government was willing to release the prisoners conditionally i.e. on the understanding to be given by the Akalis that they would agree to work for the Gurdwara Act. The Shiromani Akali Dal and the executive declared conditions imposed for the release of prisoners as wholly unnecessary, unjust and derogatory. Among the prominent Akalis, Mehtab Singh and Giani Sher Singh along with twenty other Akali leaders accepted the conditional release. Master Tara Singh, Bhag Singh Advocate, Teja Singh Samundari, Teja singh Akerpuri (Jathedar Akal Takht)and Fifteen other Akalis did not come out as government emphasis on eliciting written assurance and acceptance was to Master Tara Singh, an attack on the self-respect of the Sikhs. He said, \\"We ourselves have enacted this Act and we are responsible for implementing it, then why this condition?\\" Teja Singh Samundari died of a heart attack in the jail after some time. The Punjab Government failed to prove the charges against Master Tara Singh and the remaining Akalis, few months later they all were released unconditionally. The courage and sacrifice shown by the Akalis during the trial very soon drove the Mehtab Singh's group out of the political field and led to a rift in the Akali ranks, as the newly released Akalis condemned Mehtab Singh's group as collaborators. Mehtab Singh's group was also known as 'Rai Bahadur Party'. This group had majority in the committee and Mehtab Singh was elected its President. The Akali Party launched a campaign against the conditionally released leaders. When the new elections for the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee were held, the Akali Party won majority and the newly elected Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee elected Kharak Singh as the President and Master Tara Singh as the Vice President. Since Baba Kharak Singh had not yet been released the responsibility of the president fell on the shoulders of Master Tara Singh.At the time of 1996 the first time SGPC election is held in Himachal Pradesh and the first person who won from that seat is the candidate of panthak akalidal whose name is Satnam Singh Gill. 1953 Amendment to Gurdwaras Act of 1925 In 1953, an amendment to the 1925 act allowed the reservation of 20 out 140 seats on the SGPC for the members of the Sikh scheduled castes 2016 Amendment to Gurdwaras Act of 1925 The 2016 amendment to the act by the Indian parliament stripped around 7 million ‚ÄòSehajdhari‚Äô Sikhs of voting in the SGPC elections See also *President of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee *Chief Khalsa Diwan * Balwant Singh Nandgarh * Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee ReferencesFurther reading *Dilgeer, Dr Harjinder Singh, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920‚Äì2000), Sikh University Press, Belgium, 2000 *Dilgeer, Dr Harjinder Singh, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee Kiven Bani (Punjabi), Amritsar, S.G.P.C., 2001. *Dilgeer, Dr Harjinder Singh, Sikh Twareekh 5 volumes (Punjabi), Sikh University Press, Belgium, 2007. *Dilgeer, Dr Harjinder Singh, Sikh History, 10 volumes (English), Sikh University Press, Belgium, 2010‚Äì11. 10 volumes (English) External links *Shiromani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee *Bibi Jagir Kaur *Sikh history book by SGPC *Sikh history book *SGPC Explained Amritsar Organisations based in Punjab, India Sikhism in India Sikh organisations Gurdwaras in India ","title":"Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee"},{"id":"1343256","text":"Jake Gold (born April 4, 1958) is an American-born Canadian music manager.

Biography  He was born in Schambeck, Austria (now Zs√°mb√©k, Hungary). After working as a school-teacher in Buda, and learning the elements of music from the school-choirmaster, he became first oboist at Graz, and, at twenty-five, bandmaster of the 4th Regiment of Austrian Artillery. His first composition, a Hungarian march, written in 1836, attracted some notice, and in 1843 he was able to establish an orchestra in Berlin. With this band he travelled far, even to the United States in 1848 -1849.\\"Josef Gungl and His Celebrated American Tour: November 1848 to May 1849\\" by Roger L. Beck and Richard K.

In 1853 he became bandmaster to the 23rd Infantry Regiment at Brno, but in 1864 he moved to Munich, and in 1876 at Frankfurt, after having conducted with great success a series of promenade concerts at the Covent Garden in London in 1873. From Frankfurt, Gungl went to Weimar to live with his daughter, a well-known German opera singer, and died there.  Compositions  Gungl was a very prolific composer, and in his lifetime composed no less than 436 dances, the most popular of which being the waltzes Amoretten, Hydropaten, Casino and Dreams on the Ocean, the In Stiller Mitternacht polka, and the Blue Violets mazurka. His Hungarian march was transcribed by Franz Liszt. His music is characterized by the same-easy flowing melodies and well-marked rhythm that distinguish the dances of the younger Strauss, to whom alone he can be ranked second in this kind of composition.

He played seventeen seasons in Major League Baseball from 1970 to 1986 for the Houston Astros, Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Cardinals and the Los Angeles Dodgers. In a 17-year career, Cede√±o was a .285 hitter with 199 home runs and 976 RBI in 2006 games. His 550 stolen bases rank him 27th on the all-time list, and the 487 steals he accumulated with the Astros ranks him first on the franchise's all-time leader list ahead of superstar Craig Biggio. A 1973 offseason incident in his native Dominican Republic, that resulted in Cede√±o's conviction for involuntary manslaughter in the death of his 19 year old mistress, substantially clouded the remainder of his career, especially Cede√±o's reputation with fans; Cede√±o received no prison time and was fined $100. Baseball career=Houston Astros Signed by Houston as an amateur free agent in 1967, Cede√±o debuted on June 20, 1970 at 19 years of age. His .310 batting average in his rookie season in , allowed him to finish 4th in the Rookie of the Year voting. The very next year, he led the Major Leagues in doubles. The following season, his third, he again led in doubles, not just his league, but in the majors. He batted .320 in both 1972 and 1973. In 1972, Cede√±o hit 22 home runs, had 55 stolen bases, and again led the league in doubles. He won a Gold Glove Award that season as well. Houston manager Leo Durocher once compared Cede√±o to Willie Mays, saying \\"At 22 Cede√±o is as good or better than Willie was at the same age,\\". Cede√±o, circa 1973 Possessing a rare combination of power, blazing speed, and good defense, he became the second man in Major League history (after Lou Brock in 1967) to hit 20 home runs and steal 50 bases in one season. Cede√±o accomplished the feat three years in a row (1972‚Äì1974). He also stole 50-plus bases the next three years (1975‚Äì1977), twice led the league in doubles (1971‚Äì1972) and collected 102 RBI in the 1974 season. He would finish in the top ten of stolen base leaders from 1971-1978 and again in 1980. His 550 stolen bases rank 27th all time as of January 2018. A winner of five consecutive Gold Glove Awards (1972‚Äì1976), Cede√±o appeared in four All-Star Games (1972‚Äì1974; 1976), and was a contender for the National League MVP in 1972. In the All-Star Game of that year, Cede√±o beat out Roberto Clemente for the starting National League position. Cede√±o also hit for the cycle in both 1972 and 1976. On September 9, 1981, while playing at Atlanta Stadium, Cede√±o entered the stands to confront a heckler. No punches were thrown and no charges were filed, but Cede√±o was ejected from the game and immediately suspended as a result. On September 11, Cede√±o was fined $5000 by National League President Chub Feeney but received no further suspension, as Cede√±o apologized to the fan on the phone and in writing which Feeney cited as \\"mitigating circumstances\\". Cincinnati Reds On December 18, 1981, Cede√±o was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Ray Knight By 1985, Cede√±o was one of the Reds' five active members of the 2000-hit club, along with Pete Rose, Tony P√©rez, Dave Concepci√≥n and Buddy Bell.  St Louis Cardinals On August 29, 1985, he was traded for an outfielder named Mark Jackson to the St. Louis Cardinals, where he hit .434 with six home runs in 28 games, and arguably provided the necessary power for his new team to outpace the New York Mets to reach the playoffs. With only one month left in the season, Cede√±o had the Cardinals' longest hitting streak during their 1985 season. He then played at first base to replace the injured Jack Clark in the final regular season games, and played in the outfield in the playoffs to help replace the injured Vince Coleman. Cedeno was granted free agency on November 12, 1985. Los Angeles Dodgers Cede√±o finished his career with the Dodgers and played his final game on June 2, 1986. Estrellas Orientales In between, Cede√±o played six seasons for the Estrellas Orientales club of the Dominican Winter League, and reinforced the Tigres del Licey in the 1972 Caribbean Series. He later played with the Gold Coast Suns of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in its 1989 inaugural season. Career statistics In 17 seasons, Cede√±o was in 2006 games played, compiling a .285 batting average (2087-7310), with 436 doubles, 60 triples, 199 home runs, 976 RBI, 550 stolen bases, 664 walks, a .347 on- base percentage and .443 slugging percentage. In 17 post-season games, he hit only .173 (9-52). He played first base and all three outfield positions and recorded a .985 fielding percentage. Coaching career After retiring, Cede√±o has been both a fielding and hitting coach in the Dominican and Venezuelan winter leagues. He also served as a coach for the rookie-level Gulf Coast League farm team of the Washington Nationals before being let go in 2009. After that, he served as a hitting coach for the Greeneville Astros of the Appalachian League. Personal life On December 11, 1973, when he was 22 years old, Cede√±o was involved in an incident in his native Dominican Republic in which a gun discharged in a motel room, killing a 19-year-old woman who was in the room with him. Authorities said Cede√±o and the woman were drinking and playing with a gun when the gun fired, killing the 19-year-old. He was initially charged with voluntary manslaughter and held in prison without bail, while his lawyers negotiated for a reduction of the charge to involuntary manslaughter. He was held for 20 days before he was released on bail. He was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and fined $100.

It, and Karymsky are Kamchatka's largest, and most active and most continuous erupting volcanoes.  History  Shiveluch began forming about 60,000 to 70,000 years ago, and it has had at least 60 large eruptions during the Holocene.Global Volcanism Program During this era, the most intense period of volcanism ‚Äî including frequent large and moderate eruptions ‚Äî occurred around 6500‚Äì6400 BC, 2250‚Äì2000 BC, and AD 50‚Äì650. This coincides with the peak of activity in other Kamchatka volcanoes. The current active period started around 900 BC. Since then, the large and moderate eruptions have been following each other at 50 to 400 year-long intervals. Catastrophic eruptions took place in 1854 and 1956, when a large part of the lava dome collapsed and created a devastating debris avalanche. The most recent eruption of Young Shiveluch started on August 15, 1999, and continues . On February 27, 2015 Shiveluch erupted shooting ash into the atmosphere about 30,000 feet crossing the Bering Sea and into Alaska.  Characteristics  Terrain map of central Kamchatka Peninsula showing location of Shiveluch. Shiveluch belongs to the Kliuchevskaya volcano group. There are three elements of the volcano: the stratovolcano Old Shiveluch (–°—Ç–∞—Ä—ã–π –®–∏–≤–µ–ª—É—á); an ancient caldera; and the active Young Shiveluch (–ú–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–π –®–∏–≤–µ–ª—É—á), with an elevation of about 2,800 metres (9,186 ft).Holocene Volcanoes in Kamchatka / Shiveluch Shiveluch is one of Kamchatka's largest and most active volcanic structures. It is a stratovolcano composed of alternating layers of solidified ash, hardened lava and volcanic rocks. The nearest settlement from the volcano is Klyuchi, situated 50 km from the mountain. The settlement is small enough to evacuate rapidly in case of a major eruption.  Gallery  Image:Shiveluch activity (ash plume), 2012-11-06.pngActivity on 6 November 2012.

Co-directed by Sidney Olcott and Frank Oakes Rose, this \\"photoplay\\" was produced by the Kalem Company of New York City, and its scenes, including the climactic chariot race, were filmed in the city's borough of Brooklyn.\\"KALEM FILMS...BEN HUR\\", advertisement, The Moving Picture World (New York, N.Y.), December 7, 1907, p. 649. Internet Archive, San Francisco. Retrieved July 2, 2020. While this film is significant for being the first motion-picture adaptation of Wallace's novel, its production also served as a landmark case of copyright infringement by an early American film studio. In 1908 Kalem was successfully sued for representing parts of Wallace's book on screen without obtaining permission from the author's estate. Copies of the film, which survive, are now in the public domain and are readily available for free viewing online in the collections of various digital archives and on streaming services. PLAY video; digital copy of partial cut of Ben Hur (1907) with modern musical track added; running time 10:01. Plot With an original total running time of just 15 minutes, Kalem's \\"Roman Spectacle\\" only highlights some of the principal events described in the novel, although notably excluding Judah Ben-Hur's encounters with Jesus Christ or his presence at Christ's crucifixion. The film company in its advertising in 1907 describes the release being composed of \\"Sixteen Magnificent Scenes\\" with intertitles introducing screen presentations such as \\"Jerusalem Rebels Against Roman Mis- rule\\", \\"The Family of Hur\\", \\"Ben Hur in Chains to the Galleys\\", and \\"Ben Hur and Messala‚ÄîThe Challenge\\". A significant portion of the film's latter content is devoted to portraying the story's chariot race. Just four chariots, including those driven by Ben-Hur and Messala, are depicted, with each being drawn by teams of four black horses. Virtually all of the contest's action is implied visually, occurring off-camera, and not shown to viewers of the film. Roman spectators on screen cheer as they pretend to watch the charioteers racing three laps around the track of the Circus Maximus. Only brief footage shows the contestants speeding by the static camera as their vehicles are supposedly completing each of the laps. After Judah wins the race against Messala and the two other competitors, the intertitle \\"Ben Hur Victor\\" appears. The film then ends with spectators continuing to cheer; Judah being awarded a laurel wreath by the emperor; and Messala, who was injured during the race, lying on a stretcher and gesturing toward his former friend.  Cast  *Herman Rottjer as \\"Chief Chariotier\\" and possibly as Judah Ben-Hur *William S. Hart as Messala (uncredited and unverified involvement in film) *Gene Gauntier in unverified role *Harry T. Morey in unverified role *Beal (or Peal), Sheridan, and Matler as other \\"Drivers\\" in chariot race Production The production was directed principally by Sidney Olcott with assistance from Frank Oakes Rose, a stage manager with Henry J. Pain's Fireworks Company, an entertainment business at Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn, New York. Filmed outdoors in the October 1907, the project was shot in just four days with the production crew mindful that the region's \\"fall rains might begin at any time\\".Gauntier, p. 184. William S. Hart's casting in the film remains unverified. This image likely relates to promotion of his many performances as Messala in the 1899-1900 Broadway production of Ben Hur.\\"The Drama: A Spectacle at the Broadway, 'Ben Hur.'

ProQuest Historical Newspapers (Ann Arbor, Michigan); subscription access through The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library. The lead actors Actor William S. Hart, who would later become the silent era's foremost star of \\"cowboy pictures\\", allegedly reprised his role as Messala in Kalem's production, having already played the part on stage in the highly successful Broadway production of Ben Hur, which ran for 194 performances between late November 1899 and May 1900.\\"Ben Hur\\", cast, November 29, 1899‚ÄîMay 1900, Internet Broadway Database (IBDB), The Broadway League, Manhattan, New York. Retrieved July 4, 2020. His participation in this film, however, remains unverified from period records and is therefore suspect as fact. It appears that Hart's well-documented work in the earlier Broadway adaptation of Wallace's novel became erroneously linked to the 1907 short. If Hart were indeed cast in the film, it is surprising that Kalem in its advertising did not widely promote the presence of an established Broadway actor in the motion picture, especially a veteran of a Ben Hur production in the \\"legitimate\\" theatre. With regard to the identity of the actor who performed in the film's title role, misinformation and confusion also persist in modern sources. Many of those sources cite a professional film actor, \\"Herman Rottger\\", as Ben-Hur in Kalem‚Äôs production.The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is one source that cites \\"Herman Rottger\\" as Ben Hur in the film. Refer to \\"Ben Hur (1907)\\". IMDb, Seattle Washington. Retrieved July 5, 2020. Actually, only one verified cast member in the 1907 production, one who possessed a nearly identical name‚Äî\\"Herman Rottjer\\"‚Äîwas an employee with Pain's Fireworks Company. That entertainment company on summer nights since 1879 had staged for audiences at a \\"massive outdoor stadium and lake at Manhattan Beach\\" spectacular pyrotechnic displays to simulate famous battles, revolutions, historic fires, and natural disasters such as the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD and its destruction of the Roman town of Pompeii. In the early 1900s, Pain's live pyrodramas included elaborate sets of Roman architecture and staged chariot races.Solomon, p. 193.\\"Coney Island History: The Story of Pain's Manhattan Beach Fireworks Shows\\", Luna Park Heart of Coney Island, 2015. Retrieved July 5, 2020. In Kalem‚Äôs large advertisement for Ben Hur in the December 7, 1907 issue of the trade journal The Moving Picture World, the studio credits Rottjer as the \\"Chief Chariotier\\" in the film. That credit certainly suggests Rottjer, who was 29 years old at the time, had considerable experience driving Pain's replicas of the two-wheeled ancient vehicles, along with experience performing in Pain's summer Vesuvius-Pompeii shows and in other grand productions staged by the company. His chariot and show experience made him an ideal choice to act or \\"pantomime\\" in the role of the lead character in Kalem's short. Although Rottjer would continue to work for Pain's for several years after the film's release, he would later establish a career in the film industry. Federal census records show that in 1910 the German-born Rottjer continued to reside in Brooklyn with his wife and three daughters and was still employed at the local \\"Firework Plant\\", presumably Pain's; however, by 1917 he was working as an \\"explosion expert\\" in Brooklyn for Vitagraph Studios, which that year purchased Kalem Company.Schaefer, Fred (1917). \\"A Reel Battle is Perilously Similar to a Real One\\", The Photo-Play Journal, July 1917, p. 26.

Contrary to information given in other sources, Rottjer did not die in 1917. Later census records further document that by 1920 he had moved with his family to Hempstead in Nassau County, New York, but he was still employed in the motion-picture industry as a \\"Pyrotechnical\\" specialist.\\"Fourteenth Census of the United States: 1920\\", digital copy of original enumeration page, Town of Hempstead, Nassau County, New York, January 10, 1920.

Filming at Sheepshead Bay Race Track Although Kalem initially planned to use props and \\"standing scenery\\" from Pain's, the studio acquired most of its production needs elsewhere and opted, perhaps due to budget and scheduling constraints, to film the project's chariot race and other scenes at the Sheepshead Bay Race Track, which was located close to Manhattan Beach. The track by October 1907 was closed for the season and was immediately available for Kalem to use. The film's credited screenwriter or \\"scenarist\\", Gene Gauntier, described the film's setup in her series of autobiographical articles for Woman's Home Companion in 1928: Roman-era sets built by Pain's Fireworks Company at Manhattan Beach, c. 1903; the company where the film's co-director, Frank Oakes Rose, worked as a stage manager (Library of Congress Collection) To enhance the status of \\"The Most Superb Motion Picture Spectacle Ever Produced in America\\", Kalem would later state in its advertisements that the film's costumes were from the wardrobe collection of the Metropolitan Opera House on 39th Street in New York. In reality, the \\"Elliott's\\" screenwriter Gauntier identifies as the source for the cast's attire, was Gus Elliott, an \\"old German\\" prop and costume supplier, whose business was located at St. Mark's Place in Manhattan.Solomon, pp. 192-193. Chariot race While Rottjer was credited as the film's \\"Chief Chariotier\\" and likely drove Ben-Hur's chariot in the staged race at Sheepshead, the other charioteers were off-duty soldiers of Brooklyn's \\"3rd Battery\\" of the National Guard.Solomon, Jon. \\"The Kalem Ben Hur (1907)\\", pp. 193-194.

Members of that local military unit were well known for their expertise in horsemanship. As a testament to their equine abilities, soldiers of Brooklyn's Third Battery in August 1908 would later set a world record for \\"military endurance\\" by riding 50 miles from Nanuet, New York to Brooklyn in just six hours, much of the time traveling at night and over mountain roads.\\"Endurance Records\\", The World Almanac and Encyclopedia.

Copyright infringement Advertisement in The Moving Picture World, December 1907 In addition to being the first screen adaptation of Lew Wallace's novel, the production is noteworthy in film history as well for establishing precedent in copyright law in the United States. The motion picture was released nearly three years after Wallace's death, but it was produced by Kalem without the permission of the author's estate. Former Kalem screenwriter Gauntier remarked in her noted 1928 autobiography that in the early silent era it was a common practice for studios to ignore copyrights and dismiss any proprietary rights of original authors or creators of intellectual properties. On March 20, 1908‚Äî14 weeks after the release of Ben Hur‚Äîthe publishing house Harper & Brothers, stage producers Klaw and Erlanger, and the author's estate filed a joint copyright- infringement law suit against the Kalem Company as well as against the Kleine Optical Company, which had produced the copies of the film for Kalem's distributors. The case was initially decided against Kalem, the primary defendant, in May 1908. Three and a half years later, on appeal to the United States Supreme Court, justices in the case Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros. issued their final ruling against the film company. That ruling on November 13, 1911 established the precedent that all motion picture production companies must first secure the film rights of any previously published work still under copyright before commissioning a screenplay based on that work. Ultimately, Kalem was required to pay the plaintiffs $25,000 ($ today) as well as all related court costs for the case.\\"Connecticut Cradle of the Movies\\", The Hartford Daily Courant, December 26, 1926, p. D5; \\"Kalem's Spectacle First\\", Los Angeles Times, June 30, 1930, p. 1. ProQuest. Earlier, in 1908, perhaps seeking to capitalize on the growing publicity of its case against Kalem and the release of the film, Harper & Brothers published the lavishly designed illustrated book The Chariot Race from Ben-Hur by Lew Wallace, which excerpts only that event from the novel.

He later discussed the social stigma of illegitimacy and his personal experiences of it in a 1964 radio documentary and a 1973 op/ed piece in The Observer. He lived with his mother, Marian, until her death in 1943. Hulke attempted to register as a conscientious objector during the World War II but his application was rejected and he was conscripted into the Royal Navy.

Hulke met writer Eric Paice at Unity and the two wrote as a team for television beginning in the late-1950s with ‚ÄúThis Day in Fear‚Äù, which was produced by BBC Television in 1958 as part of its Television Playwright anthology series. The pair then wrote four plays for ABC's Armchair Theatre, produced by future Doctor Who creator Sydney Newman. Hulke and Paice also co-wrote two B-movie screenplays, Life in Danger, released in 1959 by Butchers Films, and The Man in the Back Seat, released in June 1961 by Independent Artists Studio. In 1960, Newman commissioned Hulke and Paice to write a children's science fiction serials for ABC ‚Äì Target Luna. Its success led to Newman hiring them to write three more series: Pathfinders in Space, Pathfinders to Mars, and Pathfinders to Venus. Newman went on to hire Hulke to write a total of nine episodes of The Avengers, four of which he co-wrote with Terrance Dicks, a friend and lodger at the rooming house Hulke managed and whom Hulke recruited as a co-writer when he learned of his desire to break into television. Newman moved to BBC Television to become its Head of Drama and, in 1964, asked Hulke to write a six part story for a new series Newman had created, Doctor Who. The story, ‚ÄúThe Hidden Planet‚Äù, was about a twin planet of Earth's hidden on the other side of the Sun. Hulke's story was not produced but he went on to write for the series beginning in 1967.

Military figures are usually presented unfavourably ‚Äì Invasion of the Dinosaurs and The Ambassadors of Death both have a general as the ultimate villain. One of his best-known contributions to the series is Doctor Who and the Silurians. This story depicts an encounter between the human race and the remnants of a technological reptilian race that ruled Earth in prehistoric times. Hulke avoids casting either side as heroes or monsters. He was a friend and mentor to Terrance Dicks, with whom he collaborated in 1962 on The Avengers episode \\"The Mauritius Penny\\", which was Dicks' first television credit; The War Games, Dicks' first Doctor Who script, and on the non-fiction book The Making of Doctor Who. He also contributed to Target Books' range of Doctor Who novelisations, adapting many of his scripts before his death, as well as 1973's The Green Death. Hulke's novelisations were noted for providing a wealth of additional background detail and character depth. He wrote an influential screenwriting manual, Writing for television in the 70's in 1974, and an updated version, Writing for Television, which was released posthumously in 1981. Death Hulke died of cancer on 6 July 1979, aged 54.

It is the fourth film adaptation of the novel. Charlton Heston's production company, Agamemnon Films (in association with GoodTimes Entertainment), produced this direct-to-video animated version of the story, with Heston himself reprising his role as the title character. It would prove to be his final film role before his death in 2008. Synopsis The animated version tells the same story as the 1959 film, with some differences. The story begins with Balthazar waiting in the desert for the two other wise men for a journey to Bethlehem. The story of Ben-Hur begins 30 years after the birth of Christ. In contrast to the 1925 and 1959 versions, the face of Jesus is shown and his words are heard in this film. The character of Messala is different from the 1959 film. Appearing lame, he approaches Ben- Hur for forgiveness, and joins Ben-Hur's family and Balthazar to witness the passion of Jesus. Ben-Hur gives water to Jesus on the way to Calvary. As Jesus dies, Ben-Hur and his family, with Balthazar, Messala, and Esther, clasp their hands in prayer. Miracles occur when Jesus heals Ben-Hur's family of leprosy, and enables Messala to walk again. He comes near the cross thanking Jesus for the miracle. At the film's end, Mary Magdalene sees Jesus emerge from the tomb and he ascends into heaven, giving the promise to the apostles to preach the gospel. Ben-Hur, now married to Esther, shares with his children his story and faith in Jesus.

The character is commonly associated with the X-Man Gambit. She first appeared in X-Men vol. 2 #8, and was created by Jim Lee and Scott Lobdell. Publication history Belladonna plays a major role in the first Rogue mini-series. Fictional character biography Young street-thief Remy LeBeau met Bella Donna Boudreaux when they were only children, and the pair soon became friends. Unbeknownst to them both, they came from rival Guilds (those of Thieves and Assassins, respectively). As they grew up and the rivalry between the Guilds increased, their fathers arranged for a marriage between the two in the hopes that it would unite the Guilds. Immediately after the wedding, Bella Donna's brother, Julien, lashed out in jealousy and challenged Remy in a fight to the death. Remy won, killing Julien, and as punishment, he was exiled from New Orleans. Choosing to make his own choices in life from that point on, he abandoned Bella Donna.X-Men Origins: Gambit #1 A few years later, Bella Donna sought out Gambit to help fend off the Brood, who were attacking the Guilds. Having persuaded Gambit and the X-Men to come back to New Orleans, they battled the new enemy with the aid of Dan Ketch, the second Ghost Rider.Ghost Rider Vol. 2 #26-27 Using her new psychic powers, Bella Donna followed Psylocke into the astral plane and expended her energy, before collapsing in Gambit's arms. Believing her dead, he told the Thieves Guild to take care of her, and went off for revenge against the Brood.X-Men Vol. 2 #8-9 As it happened, Bella Donna was not actually dead, but merely in a coma. Gambit risked his life to bring her Candra's Elixir of Life. In the meantime, although she was catatonic, she accidentally touched Rogue and lost her memories. She woke up without any recollection of who she was, or who Remy was, and was taken away by her father.Gambit (1993) #1-4 Bella Donna's memory slowly returned, and she felt as if her soul had been violated. Enraged and manipulated by Candra, she had Rogue's comatose old boyfriend Cody kidnapped.Rogue #1 This led to Rogue trying to rescue Cody in Louisiana. Eventually, Cody loses his life in the fight between Rogue and Candra.Rogue #2-4 Gambit returned again to New Orleans, ignorant to the multiple hits put up against him in the meantime. Bella Donna herself had taken one of the contracts, though she had no intention of killing him. Instead, she arranged it so that she could meet with him and sort out the conflicting emotions she had about him. After he was elected Viceroy of the Unified Guilds of New Orleans he passed power on to her, and returned to the X-Men. She now rules in his absence, still in love with him. She briefly entered a relationship with Bandit, a former New Warriors member, eerily reminiscent of Gambit, but Gambit subsequently revealed he was manipulating her. It has yet to be revealed whether Bella Donna has retained her mutant powers after the events of M-Day. Bella Donna reappeared, still leading the Assassin's Guild. She dispatches a group of super-villain assassins after Domino. Much later, she clashes with Kaine who takes on the Scarlet Spider identity. After hearing of Remy and Anna-Marie's wedding, Bella paid her ex-fiance a quick visit at the newlywed's humble abode right when the Thieves Guild comes crashing into it. Gambit's old flame came to warn him that none in the guilds are all too happy with whom he married and now his subordinates are gunning for both his crown and his head.Mr. & Mrs. X Vol 1 #6 She would opt to keep the sharks in her den off of his back as long as she could, but could make no guarantees due to their rival sects history before bidding farewell. Ms. Bordeaux would next turn up in the service of Candra once more as she proposed to unite the Thieves & Assassins Guilds in wake of Nate Grey's devastation of the X-Men and the mutant population. But found herself on the receiving end of her reborn patron's treachery once again when the External offered a choice between her and Rogue as a sacrifice in exchange for power or exile. Gambit would choose neither however and instead opted to free his new wife while working out a new deal between his clan and their mortal enemies while putting his adopted father; Jean-Luc LeBeau in as a regent whom oversees and reports back to him while returning leadership of the assassins back to Bella Donna. Who escorts the scheming patron of her clansmen away while joking of sending the now infantile manipulator to school if she does not behave.Mr. & Mrs. X Vol 1 #11 In other media *Bella Donna appears in the X-Men animated series, first as an image from Gambit's past in season 1, and fully in the episode \\"X-Ternally Yours\\", where she blackmails Gambit to come to her. *Bella Donna was slated to appear in the film Gambit, portrayed by Lizzy Caplan, but was cancelled following Disney's buyout of 20th Century Fox.

The scandal had political ramifications for the Radical Socialist moderate government of the day when it was revealed that Prime Minister Camille Chautemps had protected Stavisky, who suddenly died in mysterious circumstances. The political right engaged in large anti-government demonstrations on 6 February 1934, resulting in Paris police firing upon and killed fifteen demonstrators. A right-wing coup d'√©tat seemed like a possibility at the time, but historians agree that the multiple right-wing forces were uncoordinated and not trying to overthrow the government.Paul F. Jankowski, Stavisky: A Confidence Man in the Republic of Virtue (2002) Stavisky Serge Alexandre Stavisky (1888‚Äì1934), who became known as le beau Sacha (\\"Handsome Sasha\\"), was a Russian Jew born in modern- day Ukraine whose parents had moved to France. Stavisky tried his hand at various professions, working as a caf√© singer, a nightclub manager, a soup factory worker, and as the operator of a gambling den. In the 1930s he managed municipal pawnshops in Bayonne but also moved in financial circles. Stavisky sold lots of worthless bonds and financed his \\"hockshop\\" on the surety of what he called the emeralds of the late Empress of Germany--which later turned out to be glass. Stavisky maintained his fa√ßade by using his connections to many people in important positions. If a newspaper tried to investigate his affairs, he bought them off, either with large advertisement contracts or by buying the paper. In 1927 Stavisky was put on trial for fraud for the first time. However, the trial was postponed repeatedly and he was granted bail nineteen times. Stavisky probably continued his scams during this time. One judge who claimed to hold secret documents involving Stavisky was later found decapitated. Janet Flanner wrote: > The scheme which finally killed Alexandre Stavisky, his political guests' > reputations, and the uninvited public's peace of mind, was his emission of > hundreds of millions of francs' worth of false bonds on the city of > Bayonne's municipal pawnshop, which were bought up by life-insurance > companies, counseled by the Minister of Colonies, who was counseled by the > Minister of Commerce, who was counseled by the Mayor of Bayonne, who was > counseled by the little manager of the hockshop, who was counseled by > Stavisky.Janet Flanner, Paris was Yesterday (1972) Faced with exposure in December 1933, Stavisky fled. On 8 January 1934, the police found him in a chalet in Chamonix, dying from a gunshot wound. Stavisky was officially determined that have committed suicide, but there was a persistent speculation that police officers had killed him. Fourteen Parisian newspapers reported his death as a suicide, but eight did not. The distance the bullet had traveled led Le Canard encha√Æn√© to propose the tongue-in-cheek theory that Stavisky had \\"a long arm\\". Political crisis of 6 February 1934 After Stavisky's death, details about his long criminal history, his ties to the French establishment, and his controversial death became publicized. His close involvement with so many ministers led to the resignation of Prime Minister Camille Chautemps amidst accusations from the right-wing opposition that he and his police had intentionally killed Stavisky to protect influential people. When Chautemps was replaced by √âdouard Daladier, one of his first acts was to dismiss the prefect of the Paris police, Jean Chiappe, notorious for his right-wing sympathies and suspected of encouraging previous anti-government demonstrations. Daladier then dismissed the director of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise, who had been staging William Shakespeare's controversial play Coriolanus, and replaced him with the head of the S√ªret√©-G√©n√©rale, a supporter of Chautemps and Daladier's centre-left Radical Socialist Party. He also appointed a new Interior Minister, Eug√®ne Frot, who announced that demonstrators would be shot. The dismissal of Chiappe was the immediate cause of the 6 February 1934 crisis, which some saw as a possible right-wing putsch. According to historian Joel Colton, \\"The consensus among scholars is that there was no concerted or unified design to seize power and that the police lacked the coherence, unity, or leadership to accomplish such an end.\\"Joel Colton, \\"Politics and economics in the 1930s\\" in From the Ancien Regime to the Popular Front, ed. Charles K. Warner (1969), p. 183 The historian of fascism, Ren√© R√©mond, described it as \\"barely a riot ... a street demonstration\\".Peter Davies, The Extreme Right in France, 1789 to the Present: From de Maistre to Le Pen (Routledge, 2002), p. 96. However, the left feared an overt fascist conspiracy. Fomented by several conservative, anti-Semitic, monarchist, or fascist groups, including Action Fran√ßaise, the Croix-de-Feu and the Mouvement Franciste, the demonstration took place on the night of 6‚Äì7 February 1934. The police fired upon and killed fifteen demonstrators. Daladier was forced to resign. His successor was conservative Gaston Doumergue, who formed a coalition government. It was the first time during the Third Republic that a government had to resign owing to oppositional rioters. Other results were the formation of anti-fascism leagues and an alliance between the SFIO socialist party and the French Communist Party, which in turn led to the 1936 Popular Front. Further consequences The scandal engulfed a remarkable range of personalities from politics, high society and the literary-intellectual elite of Paris. Mistinguett was asked why she had been photographed with Stavisky at a nightclub; Georges Simenon reported on the unfolding affair and Stavisky's ex-bodyguard threatened him with physical violence; Colette, referring to the inability of any of Stavisky's high-placed friends to remember him, described the dead con-artist as \\"a man with no face\\". A trial of twenty people associated with Stavisky began in 1935. Printed charges were 1200 pages long. All of the accused, including Stavisky's widow, two deputies, and one general, were acquitted the following year. The amount defrauded was estimated to be the equivalent $18 million at then prevailing exchange rates plus an additional $54 million that came within months of being attained. The location of Stavisky's wealth is still unknown. The Stavisky Affair left France internally weakened. The country remained deeply divided for the rest of the decade, but the political weaknesses it exposed and exacerbated were not confined to France. The Affair was emblematic of a broader erosion of democratic values and institutions in post-World War I Europe. Portraits of the affair French film director Alain Resnais told the story in the 1974 film Stavisky, featuring Jean-Paul Belmondo in the title role and Anny Duperey as his wife Arlette. Hollywood released a depiction in 1937 with Stolen Holiday, starring Claude Rains as Stavisky's fictional counterpart, Stefan Orloff, and Kay Francis as his wife. Stolen Holiday asserted unequivocally that Orloff was shot by police and his death made to look like a suicide.

They can be either bacteria or archaea and can grow aerobically or anaerobically, and require single-carbon compounds to survive. General Methanotrophs are especially common in or near environments where methane is produced, although some methanotrophs can oxidize atmospheric methane. Their habitats include wetlands, soils, marshes, rice paddies, landfills, aquatic systems (lakes, oceans, streams) and more. They are of special interest to researchers studying global warming, as they play a significant role in the global methane budget, by reducing the amount of methane emitted to the atmosphere. Methanotrophy is a special case of methylotrophy, using single-carbon compounds that are more reduced than carbon dioxide. Some methylotrophs, however, can also make use of multi-carbon compounds which differentiates them from methanotrophs that are usually fastidious methane and methanol oxidizers. The only facultative methanotrophs isolated to date are members of the genus Methylocella and Methylocystis. In functional terms, methanotrophs are referred to as methane-oxidizing bacteria, however, methane-oxidizing bacteria encompass other organisms that are not regarded as sole methanotrophs. For this reason methane-oxidizing bacteria have been separated into four subgroups: two methane-assimilating bacteria (MAB) groups, the methanotrophs, and two autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AAOB). Methanotroph classification Methantrophs can be either bacteria or archaea. Which methanotroph species is present, is mainly determined by the availability of electron acceptors. Many types of methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB) are known. Differences in the method of formaldehyde fixation and membrane structure divide these bacterial methanotrophs into several groups. These include the Methylococcaceae and Methylocystaceae. Although both are included among the Proteobacteria, they are members of different subclasses. Other methanotroph species are found in the Verrucomicrobiae. Among the methanotrophic archaea, several subgroups are determined. Aerobic methanotrophs Under aerobic conditions, methanotrophs combine oxygen and methane to form formaldehyde, which is then incorporated into organic compounds via the serine pathway or the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, and [Carbon dioxide], which is released. Type I and type X methanotrophs are part of the Gammaproteobacteria and they use the RuMP pathway to assimilate carbon. Type II methanotrophs are part of the Alphaproteobacteria and utilize the serine pathway of carbon assimilation. They also characteristically have a system of internal membranes within which methane oxidation occurs. No methanotrophic archaea are known that can use oxygen. Anaerobic methanotrophs Under anoxic conditions, methanotrophs use different electron acceptors for methane oxidation. This can happen in anoxic habitats such as marine or lake sediments, oxygen minimum zones, anoxic water columns, rice paddies and soils. Some specific methanotrophs can reduce nitrate or nitrite, and couple that to methane oxidation. Investigations in marine environments revealed that methane can be oxidized anaerobically by consortia of methane oxidizing archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. This type of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mainly occurs in anoxic marine sediments. The exact mechanism behind this is still a topic of debate but the most widely accepted theory is that the archaea use the reversed methanogenesis pathway to produce carbon dioxide and another, unknown substance. This unknown intermediate is then used by the sulfate-reducing bacteria to gain energy from the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. The anaerobic methanotrophs are not related to the known aerobic methanotrophs; the closest cultured relative to the anaerobic methanotrophs are the methanogens in the order Methanosarcinales.. Metal-oxides, such as manganese and iron, can also be used as terminal electron acceptors by ANME. For this, no consortium is needed. ANME shuttle electrons directly to the abiotic particles, which get reduced chemically . In some cases, aerobic methane oxidation can take place in anoxic (no oxygen) environments. Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera belongs to the phylum NC10 bacteria, and can catalyze nitrite reduction through an \\"intra-aerobic\\" pathway, in which internally produced oxygen is used to oxidise methane. In clear water lakes, methanotrophs can live in the anoxic water column, but receive oxygen from photosynthetic organisms, that they then directly consume to oxidise methane aerobically . Special methanotroph species Methylococcus capsulatus is utilised to produce animal feed from natural gas. Recently, a new bacterium Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera was identified that can couple the anaerobic oxidation of methane to nitrite reduction without the need for a syntrophic partner. Based on the studies of Ettwig et al., it is believed that M. oxyfera oxidizes methane anaerobically by utilizing the oxygen produced internally from the dismutation of nitric oxide into nitrogen and oxygen gas.  Methanotroph Taxonomy  Many methanotrophic cultures have been isolated and formally characterized over the past 4 decades, starting with the classical study of Whittenbury (Whittenbury et al., 1970). Currently,18 genera of cultivated aerobic methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria and 5 genera of Alphaproteobacteria are known, represented by approx. 60 different species.  Methane Oxidation by Methanotrophs  Methanotrophs oxidize methane by first initiating reduction of an oxygen atom to H2O2 and transformation of methane to CH3OH using methane monooxygenases (MMOs). Furthermore, two types of MMO have been isolated from methanotrophs: soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). Cells containing pMMO have demonstrated higher growth capabilities and higher affinity for methane than sMMO containing cells. It is suspected that copper ions may play a key role in both pMMO regulation and the enzyme catalysis, thus limiting pMMO cells to more copper-rich environments than sMMO producing cells.

Collective security is more ambitious than systems of alliance security or collective defense in that it seeks to encompass the totality of states within a region or indeed globally, and to address a wide range of possible threats. While collective security is an idea with a long history, its implementation in practice has proved problematic. Several prerequisites have to be met for it to have a chance of working. It is the theory or practice of states pledging to defend one another in order to deter aggression or to exterminate transgressor if international order has been breached. History=Early mentions Collective security is one of the most promising approaches for peace and a valuable device for power management on an international scale. Cardinal Richelieu proposed a scheme for collective security in 1629, which was partially reflected in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. In the eighteenth century many proposals were made for collective security arrangements, especially in Europe. The concept of a peaceful community of nations was outlined in 1795 in Immanuel Kant's Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch. Kant outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states. However, he argues for the establishment of a peaceful world community not in a sense that there be a global government but in the hope that each state would declare itself as a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings. His key argument is that a union of free states would promote peaceful society worldwide: therefore, in his view, there can be a perpetual peace shaped by the international community rather than by a world government.http://www.constitution.org/kant/perpeace.htm International cooperation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war. This period also saw the development of international law with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. European diplomatic alignments shortly before the World War I. Germany and the Ottoman Empire allied after the outbreak of war. The forerunner of the League of Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), was formed by peace activists William Randal Cremer and Fr√©d√©ric Passy in 1889. The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of parliament, in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League. At the start of the twentieth century two power blocs emerged through alliances between the European Great Powers. It was these alliances that came into effect at the start of the First World War in 1914, drawing all the major European powers into the war. This was the first major war in Europe between industrialized countries and the first time in Western Europe the results of industrialization (for example mass production) had been dedicated to war. The result of this industrial warfare was an unprecedented casualty level with eight and a half million members of armed services dead, an estimated 21 million wounded, and approximately 10 million civilian deaths. By the time the fighting ended in November 1918, the war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage on the continent. Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as \\"the war to end all wars\\", and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included arms races, alliances, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. The perceived remedies to these were seen as the creation of an international organization whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage wars, and penalties that made war unattractive to nations. Theory Collective security can be understood as a security arrangement in which all states cooperate collectively to provide security for all by the actions of all against any states within the groups which might challenge the existing order by using force. That contrasts with self-help strategies of engaging in war for purely-immediate national interest. While collective security is possible, several prerequisites must be met for it to work. Collective security also contrasts with alliances by different ways. In a Ph.D dissertation by Andreatta, collective security is based on the perspective of all together in a group against any of them, rather than on unilateral idea of some against specific others. Alliances have the form of two groups against each other, such as states A+B+C against states Y+Z; however, collective security takes the form of conducting one agreement between A+B+C+Y+Z against any of them. Moreover, it is also different from an alliance since collective security is made to focus on internal regulation required universal membership, but alliance is made to deter or reduce an outside threat as an exclusive institution. In an alliance, a state would see its allies as an absolute gain and its enemies as a relative gains without legal obligation. In contrast, collective security follows the case of neutrality, as the whole group is required to punish the aggressor in the hope for it not to violate general norms, which are beyond the states' control, rather than by their self- interest. The opposite of short-term interest in which allies fight against a common threat, collective security tends to use universal interests for global peace. Sovereign nations eager to maintain the status quo willingly co-operate and accept a degree of vulnerability and, in some cases for minor nations, also accede to the interests of the chief contributing nations organising the collective security. It is achieved by setting up an international co- operative organisation under the auspices of international law, which gives rise to a form of international collective governance, despite being limited in scope and effectiveness. The collective security organisation then becomes an arena for diplomacy, the balance of power, and the exercise of soft power. The use of hard power by states, unless legitimised by the collective security organisation, is considered illegitimate, reprehensible, and necessitating remediation of some kind. The collective security organisation not only gives cheaper security but also may be the only practicable means of security for smaller nations against more powerful threatening neighbours without needing to join the camp of the nations that balance their neighbours. The concept of \\"collective security\\" was pioneered by Michael Joseph Savage, Martin Wight, Immanuel Kant, and Woodrow Wilson and was deemed to apply interests in security in a broad manner to \\"avoid grouping powers into opposing camps, and refusing to draw dividing lines that would leave anyone out.\\" The term \\"collective security\\" has also been cited as a principle of the United Nations and earlier the League of Nations. By employing a system of collective security, the United Nations hopes to dissuade any member state from acting in a manner likely to threaten peace and thus avoid a conflict. Collective security selectively incorporates the concept of both balance of power and global government. However, collective security is not the same as the balance of power, which is important in realism. According to Adreatta, the balance of power focuses on a state's unilateral interests in stopping aggression. Since states look at the world as having a security dilemma because of the fear of relative gain, a state does not want any state to become predominant and so causes a mutually-restraining equilibrium. In other words, the balance of power between states supports the decentralization of power. States are separate actors and do not subordinate their autonomy or sovereignty to a central government. \\"Singly or in combinations reflecting the coincidence of interests, States seek to influence the pattern of power distribution and to determine their own places within that pattern.\\"I.L. Claude, Jr., \\"The Management of Power in the Changing United Nations\\", International Organization, Vol. 15 (Spring 1961), pp. 219‚Äì221 The expectations of order and peace come from the belief that competing powers will somehow balance and thereby neutralize one another to produce \\"deterrence through equilibration.\\"Claude, p. 222 In contrast, under collective security, states share the long term goal of global peace, reversing relationship between individual and community goals mentioned in the balance of power theory, which fails to maintain stability. For example, it led to break down of war during the case of Napoleonic Wars and the World Wars, when states unilaterally decided to be unwilling or unable to fight. At the same time, the concept of global government is about centralization. Global government is a centralized institutional system that possesses the power use of force like a well- established sovereign nation-state. The concept strips states of their \\"standing as centers of power and policy, where issues of war and peace are concerned\\" and superimposes on them \\"an institution possessed of the authority and capability to maintain, by unchallengeable force so far as may be necessary, the order and stability of a global community.\\" Despite different characteristics of balance of power theory, collective security selectively incorporates both concepts, centralization and decentralization, which can broil down to the phrase \\"order without government.\\"I. L. Claude, Jr. \\"An Autopsy of Collective Security\\", Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 90 (Winter 1975‚Äì76), p. 715 Thus, collective security seems to be more reliable alternative since it gathers power as a team to punish the aggressor, and it is an attempt to improve international relations and to provide solid rules under anarchy. Basic assumptions Organski (1960) lists five basic assumptions underlying the theory of collective security:As quoted in Ghosh (1960), pg 89. Paraphrased. * In an armed conflict, member nation-states can agree on which nation is the aggressor. * All member nation-states are equally committed to contain and constrain the aggression, irrespective of its source or origin. * All member nation-states have an identical freedom of action and ability to join in proceedings against the aggressor. * The cumulative power of the cooperating members of the alliance for collective security is adequate and sufficient to overpower the might of the aggressor. * In the light of the threat posed by the collective might of the nations of a collective security coalition, the aggressor nation will either modify its policies or be defeated. Prerequisites Morgenthau (1948) states that three prerequisites must be met for collective security to successfully prevent war: * The collective security system must be able to assemble military force in strength greatly in excess to that assembled by the , thereby deterring the from attempting to change the world order that is defended by the collective security system. * Those nations, whose combined strength would be used for deterrence as mentioned in the first prerequisite, should have identical beliefs about the security of the world order that the collective is defending. * Nations must be willing to subordinate their conflicting interests to the common good defined in terms of the common defense of all member-states. League of Nations betrayed Czechoslovakia and signed Munich Agreement, with Nazi Germany effectively dishonoring the French- Czechoslovak alliance. After World War I, the first large-scale attempt to provide collective security in modern times was the establishment of the League of Nations in 1919 and 1920. The provisions of the League of Nations Covenant represented a weak system for decisionmaking and collective action. According to Palmer and Perking, they pointed failure of the United States to join the League of Nations and the rise of the Soviet Union outside the League as one of major reasons for its failure to enforce collective security. Moreover, an example of the failure of the League of Nations' collective security was the Manchurian Crisis, when Japan occupied part of China, both of which were League members. After the invasion, members of the League passed a resolution that called for Japan to withdraw or face severe penalties. Since every nation had a veto power, Japan promptly vetoed the resolution, severely limiting the League's ability to respond. After one year of deliberation, the League passed a resolution condemning the invasion without committing its members to any action against it. The Japanese replied by quitting the League. The Abyssinia Crisis occurred in 1935, when Fascist Italy invaded the Abyssinian Empire, now Ethiopia. In a similar process, sanctions were passed, but Italy would have vetoed any stronger resolution. Additionally, Britain and France sought to court Italy's government as a potential deterrent to Hitler since Mussolini had not yet joined the Axis powers of World War II. Thus, neither Britain nor France put any serious sanctions against the Italian government. In both cases, the absence of the United States deprived it of another major power that could have used economic leverage against either of the aggressor states. Inaction by the League subjected it to criticisms that it was weak and concerned more with European issues since most leading of its members were European, and it did not deter Hitler from his plans to dominate Europe. Abyssinian Emperor Haile Selassie continued to support collective security, as he assessed that impotence lay not in the principle but its covenantors' commitment to honor its tenets. One active and articulate exponent of collective security during the immediate prewar years was Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov. After the Munich Agreement in September 1938 and the passivity of outside powers in the face of German occupation of the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Western powers were shown not to be prepared to engage in collective security with the Soviet Union against aggression by Germany. Soviet foreign policy was revised, and Litvinov was replaced as foreign minister in early May 1939 to facilitate the negotiations that led to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact with Germany, which was signed by Litvinov's successor, Vyacheslav Molotov, on August 23. The war in Europe broke out a week later with the invasion of Poland, which started on September 1. Thus, collective security may not always work because of the lack of commitment and the unwillingness of states or the international community to act in concert (Mingst 1999).  United Nations  The leaders of some of the SEATO nations in Manila, hosted by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos on 24 October 1966 The 1945 United Nations Charter contains stronger provisions for decision-making and collective military action than those of the League of Nations Covenant, but it represents not a complete system of collective security but a balance between collective action and the continued operation of the states system, including the continued special roles of great powers. States in the UN collective security system are selective to support or oppose UN action in certain conflicts, based on their self-interests. The UN can be somehow seen as the platform for self-interest purposes for members in Security Council because of the permanent members' veto power and the excessive assistance or aid, which have made those states to act unilaterally and to ignore the approval of or to violate resolutions of the Security Council. The Iraq Crisis is a clearer example: \\"Rather than seek the global interest of peace and security through stability in Iraq and the Middle East region, the domination oriented members amassed their vast economic, diplomatic and military resources, captured and brazenly subjugated Iraq to an unprecedented condominial regime serving their economic interest under Iraq Reconstruction Programme\\" (Eke 2007). In addition, the lack of geographical spread of members in the Security Council causes an imbalance in the role of maintenance global peace and security. The voices of small countries can be heard, but policies are not adopted in response to them unless they serves the great powers' interests. However, collective security in the UN has not completely failed. The role of the UN and collective security in general is evolving with the rise of civil wars. Since the end of World War II, there have been 111 military conflicts worldwide, but only 9 of them have involved two or more states going to war with one another. The others have been civil wars in which other states have intervened in some manner. That means that collective security may have to evolve towards providing a means to ensure stability and a fair international resolution to those internal conflicts. Whether that involves more powerful peacekeeping forces or a larger role for the UN diplomatically is likely to be judged on a case-by-case basis. Collective defense thumbcenter210px Member states of NATO Collective defense is an arrangement, usually formalized by a treaty and an organization, among participant states that commit support in defense of a member state if it is attacked by another state outside the organization. NATO is the best- known collective defense organization; its famous Article 5 calls on (but does not fully commit) member states to assist another member under attack. This article was invoked only after the September 11 attacks on the United States, after which other NATO members provided assistance to the US War on Terror by participating in the War in Afghanistan. Collective defense has its roots in multiparty alliances and entails benefits as well as risks. On the one hand, by combining and pooling resources, it can reduce any single state's cost of providing fully for its security. Smaller members of NATO, for example, have leeway to invest a greater proportion of their budget on nonmilitary priorities, such as education or health, since they can count on other members to come to their defense, if needed. On the other hand, collective defense also involves risky commitments. Member states can become embroiled in costly wars benefiting neither the direct victim nor the aggressor. In World War I, countries in the collective defense arrangement known as the Triple Entente (France, Britain, Russia) were pulled into war quickly when Russia started full mobilization against Austria-Hungary, whose ally, Germany, later declared war on Russia.

The international impact of the movement includes the Black Power Revolution in Trinidad and Tobago. By the late 1960s, Black Power came to represent the demand for more immediate violent action to counter American white supremacy. Most of these ideas were influenced by Malcolm X's criticism of Martin Luther King Jr.'s peaceful protest methods. The 1965 assassination of Malcolm X, coupled with the urban riots of 1964 and 1965, ignited the movement. New organizations that supported Black Power philosophies ranging from socialism to black nationalism, including the Black Panther Party (BPP), grew to prominence. While black American thinkers such as Robert F. Williams and Malcolm X influenced the early Black Power movement, the Black Panther Party and its views are widely seen as the cornerstone. It was influenced by philosophies such as pan-Africanism, black nationalism and socialism, as well as contemporary events including the Cuban Revolution and the decolonization of Africa.Komozi Woodard, \\"Rethinking the Black Power Movement\\", Africana Age. History=Origins The first popular use of the term \\"Black Power\\" as a social and racial slogan was by Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture) and Willie Ricks (later known as Mukasa Dada), both organizers and spokespeople for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. On June 16, 1966, in a speech in Greenwood, Mississippi, during the March Against Fear, Carmichael led the marchers in a chant for black power that was televised nationally. The organization Nation of Islam began as a black nationalist movement in the 1930s, inspiring later groups. Malcolm X is largely credited with the group's dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s (from 500 to 25,000 by one estimate; from 1,200 to 50,000 or 75,000 by another). In March 1964, Malcolm X left the Nation due to disagreements with Elijah Muhammad; among other things, he cited his interest in working with other civil rights leaders, saying that Muhammad had prevented him from doing so. Later, Malcolm X also said Muhammad had engaged in extramarital affairs with young Nation secretariesa serious violation of the group's teachings. On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was shot and killed while speaking at the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights, New York City. Three Nation members were convicted of assassinating him. Despite this, there has long been speculation and suspicion of government involvement. The forty police officers at the scene were instructed to \\"stand down\\" by their commanding officers while the shooting took place. After the Watts riots in Los Angeles in 1965, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee decided to cut ties with the mainstream civil rights movement. They argued that blacks needed to build power of their own, rather than seek accommodations from the power structure in place. SNCC migrated from a philosophy of nonviolence to one of greater militancy after the mid-1960s. The organization established ties with radical groups such as the Students for a Democratic Society. In late October 1966, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party. In formulating a new politics, they drew on their experiences working with a variety of Black Power organizations.Seale, 1970, part I; Newton, 1973, parts 2‚Äì3; Bloom and Martin, 2013, chapter 1; Murch, 2010, part II and chapter 5. Escalation in the late 1960s Black Panther Party members marching and carrying flags. The Black Panther Party initially utilized open-carry gun laws to protect party members and local black communities from law enforcement. Party members also recorded incidents of police brutality by distantly following police cars around neighborhoods.Bloom and Martin, 45. Numbers grew slightly starting in February 1967, when the party provided an armed escort at the San Francisco airport for Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow and keynote speaker at a conference held in his honor.Black Panther Newspaper, May 15, 1967, p. 3; Bloom and Martin, 71‚Äì72. By 1967, the SNCC began to fall apart due to policy disputes in its leadership and many members left for the Black Panthers.C. Gerald Fraser, \\"SNCC Has Lost Much of Its Power to Black Panthers\\", New York Times news service (Eugene Register-Guard), October 9, 1968. Throughout 1967 the Panthers staged rallies and disrupted the California State Assembly with armed marchers.Pearson, 129. In late 1967 the FBI developed COINTELPRO to investigate black nationalist groups and others.Stohl, 249. By 1969, the Black Panthers and their allies had become primary COINTELPRO targets, singled out in 233 of the 295 authorized \\"black nationalist\\" COINTELPRO actions. In 1968 the Republic of New Afrika was founded, a separatist group seeking a black country in the southern United States, only to dissolve by the early 1970s. By 1968, many Black Panther leaders had been arrested, including founder Huey Newton for the murder of a police officer (Newton's prosecution was eventually dismissed), yet membership surged. Black Panthers later engaged the police in a firefight in a Los Angeles gas station. In the same year, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, creating nationwide riots, the widest wave of social unrest since the American Civil War.Peter B. Levy , Baltimore '68, p. 6. In Cleveland, Ohio, the \\"Republic of New Libya\\" engaged the police in the Glenville shootout, which was followed by rioting. The year also marked the start of the White Panther Party, a group of whites dedicated to the cause of the Black Panthers. Founders Pun Plamondon and John Sinclair were arrested, but eventually freed, in connection to the bombing of a Central Intelligence Agency office in Ann Arbor, Michigan that September. By 1969, the Black Panthers began purging members due to fear of law enforcement infiltration and engaged in multiple gunfights with police, and one with a black nationalist organization. The Panthers continued their \\"Free Huey\\" campaign internationally. In the spirit of rising militancy, the League of Revolutionary Black Workers was formed in Detroit, which supported labor rights and black liberation. Peak in the early 1970s In 1970 the Honorary Prime Minister of the Black Panther Party, Stokely Carmichael, traveled to various countries to discuss methods to resist \\"American imperialism\\".Joseph, Peniel E. Waiting 'Til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America, Henry Holt and Company, 2007. In Trinidad, the black power movement had escalated into the Black Power Revolution in which many Afro-Trinidadians forced the government of Trinidad to give into reforms. Later many Panthers visited Algeria to discuss Pan-Africanism and anti-imperialism. In the same year former Black Panthers formed the Black Liberation Army to continue a violent revolution rather than the party's new reform movements.Marie-Agn√®s Combesque, \\"Caged panthers\\", Le Monde diplomatique, 2005. On October 22, 1970, the Black Liberation Army is believed to have planted a bomb in St. Brendan's Church in San Francisco while it was full of mourners attending the funeral of San Francisco police officer Harold Hamilton, who had been killed in the line of duty while responding to a bank robbery. The bomb was detonated, but no one in the church suffered serious injuries.Van Derbeken and Lagos. \\"Ex-militants charged in S.F. police officer's '71 slaying at station\\", San Francisco Chronicle (January 23, 2007). In 1971, several Panther officials fled the U.S. due to police concerns. This was the only active year of the Black Revolutionary Assault Team, a group that bombed the New York South African consular office in protest of apartheid. On September 20 it placed bombs at the UN Missions of Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) and the Republic of Malawi.Edward F. Mickolaus, Transnational Terrorism: a chronology of events, Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 1980, p. 258. In February 1971, ideological splits within the Black Panther Party between leaders Newton and Eldridge Cleaver led to two factions within the party; the conflict turned violent and four people were killed in a series of assassinations.Donald Cox, \\"Split in the Party\\", New Political Science, Vol. 21, No. 2, 1999. On May 21, 1971, five Black Liberation Army members participated in the shootings of two New York City police officers, Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones. Those brought to trial for the shootings include Anthony Bottom (also known as Jalil Muntaqim), Albert Washington, Francisco Torres, Gabriel Torres, and Herman Bell. During the jail sentence of White Panther John Sinclair a \\"Free John\\" concert took place, including John Lennon and Stevie Wonder. Sinclair was released two days later. On August 29, three BLA members murdered San Francisco police sergeant John Victor Young at his police station. Two days later, the San Francisco Chronicle received a letter signed by the BLA claiming responsibility for the attack. Late in the year Huey Newton visited China for meetings on Maoist theory and anti- imperialism.Revolutionary Suicide Penguin classics Delux Edition\\" page 352 Black Power icon George Jackson attempted to escape from prison in August, killing seven hostages only to be killed himself. Jackson's death triggered the Attica Prison uprising which was later ended in a bloody siege. On November 3, Officer James R. Greene of the Atlanta Police Department was shot and killed in his patrol van at a gas station by Black Liberation Army members. 1972 was the year Newton shut down many Black Panther chapters and held a party meeting in Oakland, California. On January 27, the Black Liberation Army assassinated police officers Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie in New York City. After the killings, a note sent to authorities portrayed the murders as a retaliation for the prisoner deaths during 1971 Attica prison riot. To date no arrests have been made. On July 31, five armed BLA members hijacked Delta Air Lines Flight 841, eventually collecting a ransom of $1 million and diverting the plane, after passengers were released, to Algeria. The authorities there seized the ransom but allowed the group to flee. Four were eventually caught by French authorities in Paris, where they were convicted of various crimes, but one ‚Äì George Wright ‚Äì remained a fugitive until September 26, 2011, when he was captured in Portugal. After being accused of murdering a prostitute in 1974, Huey Newton fled to Cuba. Elaine Brown became party leader and embarked on an election campaign.Perkins, Margo V. Autobiography As Activism: Three Black Women of the Sixties, Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2000, p. 5. De-escalation in the late 1970s In the late 1970s a rebel group named after the killed prisoner formed the George Jackson Brigade. From March 1975 to December 1977, the Brigade robbed at least seven banks and detonated about 20 pipe bombs ‚Äì mainly targeting government buildings, electric power facilities, Safeway stores, and companies accused of racism. In 1977, Newton returned from exile in Cuba. Shortly afterward, Elaine Brown resigned from the party and fled to Los Angeles.Brown, 444‚Äì50. The Party fell apart, leaving only a few members. MOVE developed in Philadelphia in 1972 as the \\"Christian Movement for Life\\", a communal living group based on Black Liberation principles. When police raided their house in 1978, a firefight broke out; during the shootout, one officer was killed, seven other police officers, five firefighters, three MOVE members, and three bystanders were also injured. In another high-profile incident of the Black Liberation Army, Assata Shakur, Zayd Shakur and Sundiata Acoli were said to have opened fire on state troopers in New Jersey after being pulled over for a broken taillight. Zayd Shakur and state trooper Werner Foerster were both killed during the exchange. Following her capture, Assata Shakur was tried in six different criminal trials. According to Shakur, she was beaten and tortured during her incarceration in a number of different federal and state prisons. The charges ranged from kidnapping to assault and battery to bank robbery. Assata Shakur was found guilty of the murder of both Foerster and her companion Zayd Shakur, but escaped prison in 1979 and eventually fled to Cuba and received political asylum. Acoli was convicted of killing Foerster and sentenced to life in prison. In 1978 a group of Black Liberation Army and Weather Underground members formed the May 19th Communist Organization, or M19CO. It also included members of the Black Panthers and the Republic of New Africa. In 1979 three M19CO members walked into the visitor's center at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women near Clinton, New Jersey. They took two guards hostage and freed Shakur. Several months later M19CO arranged for the escape of William Morales, a member of Puerto Rican separatist group Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci√≥n Nacional Puertorrique√±a from Bellevue Hospital in New York City, where he was recovering after a bomb he was building exploded in his hands. Decline in the 1980s Over the 1980s the Black Power movement continued despite a decline in its popularity and organization memberships. The Black Liberation Army was active in the US until at least 1981 when a Brinks truck robbery, conducted with support from former Weather Underground members Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, left a guard and two police officers dead. Boudin and Gilbert, along with several BLA members, were subsequently arrested.CourtTV Crime Library, Ambush: The Brinks Robbery of 1981 M19CO engaged in a bombing campaign in the 1980s. They targeted a series of government and commercial buildings, including the U.S. Senate. On November 3, 1984, two members of the M19CO, Susan Rosenberg and Timothy Blunk, were arrested at a mini-warehouse they had rented in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Police recovered more than 100 blasting caps, nearly 200 sticks of dynamite, more than 100 cartridges of gel explosive, and 24 bags of blasting agent from the warehouse. The M19CO alliance's last bombing was on February 23, 1985, at the Policemen's Benevolent Association in New York City. MOVE had relocated to West Philadelphia after the earlier shootout. On May 13, 1985, the police, along with city manager Leo Brooks, arrived with arrest warrants and attempted to clear the MOVE building and arrest the indicted MOVE members. This led to an armed standoff with police, who lobbed tear gas canisters at the building. MOVE members shot at the police, who returned fire with automatic weapons. The police then bombed the house, killing several adults and children, and causing a large fire that destroyed the better part of a city block. In 1989, well into the waning years of the movement, the New Black Panther Party formed. In the same year on August 22, Huey P. Newton was fatally shot outside by 24-year-old Black Guerilla Family member Tyrone Robinson. Characteristics=Education The fifth point of the Black Panther Party's Ten-Point Program called for \\"education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present day society.\\" This sentiment was echoed in many of the other Black Power organizations; the inadequacy of black education had earlier been remarked on by W. E. B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey, and Carter G. Woodson. With this backdrop, Stokely Carmichael brought political education into his work with SNCC in the rural South. This included get-out-the-vote campaigns and political literacy. Bobby Seale and Huey Newton used education to address the lack of identity in the black community. Seale had worked with youth in an after-school program before starting the Panthers. Through this new education and identity building, they believed they could empower black Americans to claim their freedom. Media Just as Black Power activists focused on community control of schools and politics, the movement took a major interest in creating and controlling its own media institutions. Most famously, the Black Panther Party produced the Black Panther newspaper, which proved to be one of the BPP's most influential tools for disseminating its message and recruiting new members. WAFR was launched in September 1971 as the first public, community-based black radio station. The Durham, North Carolina, station broadcast until 1976, but influenced later activist radio stations including WPFW in Washington, D.C. and WRFG in Atlanta. Legacy New Black Panther Party members marching in 2007 After the 1970s the Black Power movement saw a decline, but not an end. In the year 1998 the Black Radical Congress was founded, with debatable effects. The Black Riders Liberation Party was created by Bloods and Crips gang members as an attempt to recreate the Black Panther Party in 1996. The group has spread, creating chapters in cities across the United States, and frequently staging paramilitary marches. During the 2008 presidential election New Black Panther Party members were accused of voter intimidation at a polling station in a predominantly black, Democratic voting district of Philadelphia.\\"Republicans Push For New Black Panther Hearing\\". CBS News, July 27, 2010. After the politically upsetting shooting of Trayvon Martin black power paramilitaries formed, including the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, African American Defense League, and the New Black Liberation Militia, all staging armed marches and military training. Some have compared the modern movement Black Lives Matter to the Black Power movement, noting its similarities.

The club comes from Limavady, County Londonderry, and plays home matches at the Showgrounds. Club colours are royal blue shirts with white trim, blue socks and royal blue shorts. Away colours are all yellow. The current manager is Lee Guy, who took over from Mark Clyde in 2020. History The club was formed in 1884 when Alexander (formed in 1880 by the Alexander Cricket Club, which itself was formed in 1878) amalgamated with another local club, Wanderers. Alexander had been a founder member of the Irish Football Association in 1880, contributing to the purchase of the original Irish Cup.Northern Whig, 8 December 1884; Belfast Newsletter, 12 October 1880 Nicknamed \\"The Roesiders\\" or \\"The Lims\\", in 1885 and 1886 the club reached consecutive Irish Cup Finals, losing both to Distillery - the first 3‚Äì0 and the second 1‚Äì0. After a protest by Limavady in 1886 the result was confirmed, but medals were withheld from both teams in spite of a challenge in the High Court by a Distillery player. Between 1882 and 1888, the club provided seven internationals to the Irish national football team. The club also famously travelled to Liverpool in 1886, and defeated Everton 1‚Äì0- the first team from outside Great Britain to do so. After a long time as a junior team, the club joined the senior Irish Football League in 1997‚Äì98, and reached its first Irish Cup semi-final in over a century in 2003‚Äì04. In 2008, the club lost its senior status when it failed to gain admission to the new IFA Premiership. Since then, the club played in the IFA Championship until relegation in May 2019. In April 2013, three players received suspensions after being found guilty of breaching IFA betting rules on one of the club's league matches. The club won the NIFL Championship 2 in the 2015-2016 season but were denied promotion to NIFL Championship 1 as they were unsuccessful in applying for a licence. However they were promoted as winners of the Premier Intermediate League in 2016-2017 Carlos Tevez loan In September 2011, the club vice chairman David Brewster issued a fax to Manchester City, offering to take Argentinian International Carlos Tevez on loan after the player had refused to go on as a substitute in a UEFA Champions League fixture. The club offer suggested that they would ensure Tevez stayed match fit and would avoid being cup tied, but asked that City continued to pay his reported ¬£200,000 per week wages, a figure higher than Limavady's entire turnover for a year. The offer, although meant as tongue in cheek became global headline news with some news agencies believing the offer to be a serious one. The story gained the club brief worldwide recognition although Manchester City themselves did not respond.

Iranian art films have garnered international fame and now enjoy a global following.The Iranian Cinema Iranian films are usually written and spoken in the Persian language. Iranian cinema has had many ups and downs.Iran cinema history Along with China, Iran has been lauded as one of the best exporters of cinema in the 1990s.Abbas Kiarostami: Articles & Interviews Some critics now rank Iran as the world's most important national cinema, artistically, with a significance that invites comparison to Italian neorealism and similar movements in past decades. A range of international film festivals have honoured Iranian cinema in the last twenty years. Many film critics from around the world have praised Iranian cinema as one of the world's most important artistic cinemas. History=Visual arts in Iran The earliest examples of visual representations in Iranian history may be traced back to the bas-reliefs in Persepolis (c. 500 BC). Bas relief is a method of sculpting which entails carving or etching away the surface of a flat piece of stone or metal. Persepolis was the ritual center of the ancient kingdom of Achaemenids and \\"the figures at Persepolis remain bound by the rules of grammar and syntax of visual language.\\"Honour, Hugh and John Fleming, The Visual Arts: A History. New Jersey, Prentice Hall Inc, 1992. Page: 96. Iranian visual arts may be said to have peaked about a thousand years later during the Sassanian reign. A bas-relief from this period in Taq Bostan (western Iran) depicts a complex hunting scene. Similar works from the period have been found to articulate movements and actions in a highly sophisticated manner. It is even possible to see the progenitor of the cinema close-up: a wounded wild pig escaping from the hunting ground,Iranian Cinema: Before the Revolution among these works of art. After the conversion from Zoroastrianism to Islam; Persian art continued its visual practices. Persian miniatures provide great examples of such continued attempts. The deliberate lack of perspective in Persian miniature enabled the artist to have different plots and sub-plots within the same image space. A very popular form of such art was Pardeh Khani. Another type of art in the same category was Naqqali. Popular dramatic performance arts in Iran, before the advent of cinema, include Marionette, Saye-bazi (shadow plays), Rouhozi (comical acts), and Ta'zieh.M. Ali Issari, Cinema in Iran: 1900-1979 pages 40-67. Early Persian cinema Cinema was only five years old when it came to Persia at the beginning of the 20th century. The first Persian filmmaker was Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi, the official photographer of Muzaffar al-Din Shah, the King of Persia from 1896-1907\\\\. After a visit to Paris in July 1900, Akkas Bashi obtained a camera and filmed the Shah's visit to Europe upon the Shah's orders. He is said to have filmed the Shah's private and religious ceremonies, but no copies of such films exist today. A few years after Akkas Bashi started photography, Khan Baba Motazedi, another pioneer in Iranian motion picture photography emerged. He shot a considerable amount of newsreel footage during the reign of Qajar to the Pahlavi dynasty.M. A Issari, Cinema in Iran, page 96. The first public screening took place in Tehran in 1904, presented by Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahaf Bashi. He arranged the screening in the back of his antique shop. In 1905, Sahaf Bashi opened the first movie theater in Cheragh Gaz Avenue in the national capital. In 1909, with fall of the Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar heir of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar and the success of the constitutionalists, Russi Khan lost his support. Consequently, his film theatre and photography studios were destroyed by the public. Soon after, other cinema theatres in Tehran closed down. Movie theatres sprang up again in 1912 with the help of Ardeshir Khan, an Armenian-Iranian.Iranian Cinema: Before the Revolution In 1904, Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi opened the first movie theater in Tehran. The cinematographic camera was introduced to Iran in 1929, as yet another tool of modernization. After Mirza Ebrahim Khan, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were little more than 15 theatres in Tehran and 11 in other provinces. In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian, decided to establish the first film school in Iran. Within five years he managed to run the first session of the school under the name \\"Parvareshgahe Artistiye Cinema\\".Omid, Jamal. The History of Iranian Cinema 1900-1978. Tehran: Rozaneh Publication, 1995, 1174 pgs (Persian). 1930s and 1940s Roohangiz Saminejad in Lor Girl (1933) In 1930 the first Iranian silent film was made by Professor Ovanes Ohanian called Abi and Rabi. In 1933 he made his second film titled Haji Agha. Later that year, Abdolhossein Sepanta made the first Iranian sound film, entitled Lor Girl, which was released in 1933 in two Tehran cinemas, Mayak and Sepah. The story of the film was based on a comparison between the state of security in Iran at the end of the Qajar dynasty and during Reza Shah period. Sepanta would go on to direct movies such as Ferdowsi (the life story of the most celebrated epic poet of Iran), Shirin and Farhad (a classic Iranian love story), and Black Eyes (the story of Nader Shah's invasion of India). In 1937, he directed Laili and Majnoon, an Eastern love story similar to the English story of Romeo and Juliet. The present day Iranian film industry owes much of its progress to two industrious personalities, Esmail Koushan and Farrokh Ghaffari. By establishing the first National Iranian Film Society in 1949 at the Iran Bastan Museum and organizing the first Film Week during which English films were exhibited, Ghaffari laid the foundation for alternative and non-commercial films in Iran. Early Persian directors like Abdolhossein Sepanta and Esmail Koushan took advantage of the richness of Persian literature and ancient Persian mythology. In their work, they emphasized ethics and humanity.Iranian filmmakers and influence of Ancient Persian literature Pre-revolutionary cinema, 1950s-1970s Ezzatollah Entezami in The Cow (1969) Behrouz Vossoughi & Jamshid Mashayekhi in Qeysar (1969) The 1960s was a significant decade for Iranian cinema, with 25 commercial films produced annually on average throughout the early ‚Äò60s, increasing to 65 by the end of the decade. The majority of production focused on melodrama and thrillers. From 1937 till 1947 because of the world economic conditions and then the involvement in World War Two, the motion picture industry in Iran did not produce a single film, but the flow of foreign film to Iran did not stop. In 1947, Esmail Koushan, with the help of some of his colleagues, established Mitra Films (1997), the first real film company in Tehran. Through their persistence, local feature film production was born and survived. The movie that really boost the economy of Iranian cinema and initiated a new genre was Ganj-e Qarun (Croesus Treasure), made in 1965 by Syamak Yasami. Three years later Davoud Mollapour directed Shohare Ahoo Khanoom (Madam Ahou's Husband), which revolutionized Iranian Cinema by portraying women's role in the Iranian society at that time. It also showed actresses (Mehri Vadadian and Adile Eshragh) to be the heroes on big screen for the first time. In 1969, Masoud Kimiai made Kaiser. With Kaiser (Qeysar), Kimiai depicted the ethics and morals of the romanticized poor working class of the Ganj-e-Qarun genre through his main protagonist, the titular Qeysar. But Kimiay's film generated another genre in Iranian popular cinema: the tragic action drama.Shahin Parhami, Iranian Cinema: Before the Revolution With the screening of the films Shohare Ahoo Khanoom directed by Davoud Mollapour in 1968, and Kaiser and The Cow, directed by Masoud Kimiai and Darius Mehrjui respectively in 1969, alternative film established their status in the film industry. By 1970 Iranian cinema entered into its mature stage. The College of Dramatic Arts, instituted in 1963, produced its first graduates at the decade's beginning. Many progressive film co-ops and associations came into existence and there were a few regular film festivals taking place in the country. Attempts to organize a film festival that had begun in 1954 within the framework of the Golrizan Festival, bore fruits in the form of the Sepas Film Festival in 1969. The first Iranian film festival was held in 1970 with Kaiser, The Cow, and Shohare Ahoo Khanoom winning the first, second and third prize for the best pictures respectively. The endeavors of Ali Mortazavi also resulted in the formation of the Tehran International Film Festival in 1973. From 1950 to the mid-1960 the Iranian film industry grew rapidly. Many studios were established as well as others that entered the Cycle of the film industry independently. There were 324 films produced during this period 1950 for 1965. By 1965 there were 72 movie theatres in Tehran and 192 in other Provinces. Ebrahim Golestan in 1965 directed by films of interest Brick and Mirror 1965. Bahram Beyzai is the director of one of the ground-breaking films of the Iranian New wave, 1972 Ragbar (Downpour). Sohrab Shahid-Saless is auteur director who embodied his original style in his 1975 film Still Life. Abbas Kiarostami is now a well-known director of the 1990s who directed one of the last films that screened before the revolution in 1978, Gozaresh (The Report). Post-revolutionary cinema In the early 1970s, a New Iranian Cinema emerged (cinema motef√§vet). However, following the Revolution in 1979, a few filmmakers and actors went into exile as Khomeini altered the focus in features. Between 1979 and 1985, about 100 features were released. While Khomeini's censorship remained, the small number of features produced focused on sexual display and European influence. In 1982, the annual Fajr Film Festival financed films. The Farabi Cinema Foundation then stepped in to try and reassemble the disorganized cinema. The following year, the government began to provide financial aid. This change in regime encouraged a whole new generation of filmmakers, which included female directors as well. With this, the focus shifted to children overcoming obstacles: true stories, lyrical, mystical drama, real-life problems, documentary footage, etc. Post- revolutionary Iranian cinema has been celebrated in many international forums and festivals for its distinct style, themes, authors, idea of nationhood, and cultural references. Starting With Viva... by Khosrow Sinai and followed by many excellent Iranian directors who emerged in the last few decades, such as Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi. Kiarostami, who some critics regard as one of the few great directors in the history of cinema,Kiarostami Will Carry Us; The Iranian Master Gives Hope planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema when he won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Taste of Cherry in 1997. The continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious international festivals such as the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, and the Berlin Film Festival attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces .. In 2006, six Iranian films, of six different styles, represented Iranian cinema at the Berlin Film Festival. Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of Iranian cinema.Iran's strong presence in 2006 Berlin Film FestivalIran films return to Berlin festival An important step was taken in 1998 when the Iranian government began to fund ethnic cinema. Since then Iranian Kurdistan has seen the rise of numerous filmmakers. In particular, the film industry got momentum in Iranian Kurdistan and the region has seen the emergence of filmmakers such as Bahman Ghobadi, actually the entire Ghobadi family, Ali-Reza Rezai, Khosret Ressoul and many other younger filmmakers.\\"Kurdish Cinema Really Started out with Yilmaz G√ºney\\" There is also movie-documentary production, often critical of the society in the name of the Islamic revolution ideal, like the films directed by Mohammedreza Eslamloo. By the year 2001 the number of features produced in Iran rose to 87 (from 28, which is the number of films that were produced in 1980, after the fall of the Shah). The most popular genres were melodramas and historical pageants which seldom went to festivals. In 1997, the newly elected president, Mohammed Khatemi, would eventually come to play a role in helping filmmakers achieve a certain degree of artistic freedom. Contemporary Iranian cinema Today, the Iranian box office is dominated by commercial Iranian films. Western films are occasionally shown in movie theaters. and contemporary Hollywood productions are shown on state television. Iranian art films are often not screened officially, and are viewable via unlicensed DVDs which are available. Some of these acclaimed films were screened in Iran and had box office success. Examples include Rassul Sadr Ameli's \\"I‚Äôm Taraneh, 15\\", Rakhshan Bani-Etemad's \\"Under the skin of the City\\", Bahman Ghobadi's \\"Marooned in Iraq\\" and Manijeh Hekmat's \\"Women's Prison\\".Qantara.de - - Iranian Cinema - Beyond Festival Films Commercial cinema in Iran The internationally award-winning cinema of Iran is quite different from the domestically oriented films.

In the more conservative social climate of Iran after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, however, he came to be considered an embarrassment to Iranian national identity and his films -- which depicted romance, alcohol, vulgarity, objectification of women, scantily-dressed men and women, nightclubs, and a vulgar lifestyle now condemned by the Islamic government -- were banned. Although this would effectively prevent Fardin from making films for the remainder of his life, the ban did little to diminish his broad popularity with Iranian moviegoers: His funeral in Tehran was attended by 20,000 mourners.BBC News. (2000). \\"Iranian 'King of Hearts' dies\\". BBC News. Retrieved November 8, 2006. Before Fardin, one could argue, Iran simply did not have a commercial cinema.Farewell to Fardin: Death of legendary actor marks end of an era During the war years, crime thrillers such as Senator, The Eagles, Boycott, The Tenants, and Kani Manga occupied the first position on the sales charts.http://www.offscreen.com/biblio/essays/women_of_iran/ Officially, the Iranian government disdains American cinema: in 2007 President Ahmadinejad's media adviser told the Fars news agency, \\"We believe that the American cinema system is devoid of all culture and art and is only used as a device.\\"\\"Ahmadinejad turns down chance to star in Oliver Stone film\\", The Guardian, July 2, 2007. However, numerous Western commercial films such as Jaws, The Illusionist, Passion of the Christ, House of Sand and Fog, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Sherlock Holmes, Alpha and Omega, Scarface, Casino Royale, The Mechanic, and The Aviator have been screened in Iranian cinemas and Iranian film festivals since the revolution. Despite great pride in the country's more than 100-year film history, Western cinema is enormously popular among Iran's young people, and practically every recent Hollywood film is available on CD, DVD, or video.Sixteen foreign films to compete at Fajr FestivalIran Daily - Arts & Culture - 12/13/06 State television has also broadcast more Western movies‚Äîpartly because millions of Iranians have been switching to the use of banned satellite television equipment. Iranian New Wave films Nasser Taghvaee Bahram Bayzai, voted the best Persian filmmaker of all time in 2002 Iranian New Wave refers to a new movement in Iranian cinema. According to film critic Eric Henderson, the acclaimed documentary The House Is Black (ÿÆÿßŸÜŸá ÿ≥€åÿßŸá ÿßÿ≥ÿ™) directed by Forough Farrokhzad (famous Iranian poet and director) paved the way for the Iranian New Wave. The movement started in 1964 with Hajir Darioush's second film Serpent's Skin, which was based on D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover featuring Fakhri Khorvash and Jamshid Mashayekhi. Darioush's two important early social documentaries But Problems Arose in 1965, dealing with the cultural alienation of the Iranian youth, and Face 75, a critical look at the westernization of the rural culture, which was a prizewinner at the 1965 Berlin Film Festival, were also contributing significantly to the establishment of the New Wave. In 1968, after the release of Shohare Ahoo Khanoom directed by Davoud Mollapour, and the 1969 release of The Cow directed by Darius Mehrjui followed by Masoud Kimiai's Qeysar, and Nasser Taqvai's Tranquility in the Presence of Others, the New Wave became well established as a prominent cultural, dynamic and intellectual trend. The Iranian viewer became discriminating, encouraging the new trend to prosper and develop. In the 1960s, there were 'New Wave' movements in the cinema of numerous countries. The pioneers of the Iranian New Wave were directors like Forough Farrokhzad, Sohrab Shahid Saless, Bahram Beizai, and Parviz Kimiavi. They made innovative art films with highly political and philosophical tones and poetic language. Subsequent films of this type have become known as the New Iranian cinema to distinguish them from their earlier roots. The most notable figures of the Iranian New Wave are Abbas Kiarostami, Jafar Panahi, Majid Majidi, Bahram Beizai, Darius Mehrjui, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Khosrow Sinai, Sohrab Shahid-Saless, Parviz Kimiavi, Samira Makhmalbaf, Amir Naderi, and Abolfazl Jalili. The factors leading to the rise of the New Wave in Iran were, in part, due to the intellectual and political movements of the time. A romantic climate was developing after the 19 August 1953 coup in the sphere of arts. Alongside this, a socially committed literature took shape in the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1960s, which may consider as the golden era of contemporary Persian literature.The New Wave in Iranian Cinema - From Past to Present Features of New Wave Iranian film, in particular the works of legendary Abbas Kiarostami, can be classified as postmodern. Iranian New Wave films shared some characteristics with the European art films of the period, in particular Italian Neorealism. However, in her article 'Real Fictions', Rose Issa argues that Iranian films have a distinctively Iranian cinematic language :\\"that champions the poetry in everyday life and the ordinary person by blurring the boundaries between fiction and reality, feature film with documentary.\\" She also argues that this unique approach has inspired European cinema directors to emulate this style, citing Michael Winterbottom's award winning In This World (2002) as an homage to contemporary Iranian cinema. Issa claims that \\"This new, humanistic aesthetic language, determined by the film-makers‚Äô individual and national identity, rather than the forces of globalism, has a strong creative dialogue not only on home ground but with audiences around the world.\\"Real Fictions In his book Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present, Future (2001) Hamid Dabashi describes modern Iranian cinema and the phenomenon of [Iranian] national cinema as a form of cultural modernity. According to Dabashi, \\"the visual possibility of seeing the historical person (as opposed to the eternal Qur'anic man) on screen is arguably the single most important event allowing Iranians access to modernity.\\" While Beyzai and Taghvai represent the first generation and Karim-Masihi and Kiarostami represent the second generation of New wave filmmakers, the third generation is represented by Rafi Pitts, Bahman Ghobadi, Maziar Miri, Asghar Farhadi, Mani Haghighi, and Babak Payami,Rising talent on Iranian SceneTo Kiarostami or Not To Kiarostami along with newly emerged filmmakers such as Saman Salur and Abdolreza Kahani. Iranian popular art films Parallel to the Iranian New Wave, with its neorealist and minimalist art cinema, there exists a so-called \\"popular art cinema\\" in Iran. Filmmakers who belong to this circle make films with a broader range of audience than the narrow spectrum of highly educated people who admire the New Wave, but believe that their movies are also artistically sound. Filmmakers such as Nasser Taghvaee and Ali Hatami are the best examples of this cinematic movement (some of these filmmakers also make new wave films e.g. Mum's Guest by Darius Mehrjui). The Demon and the Bald Hassan, Adam and Eve, The Fisherman's Story, City of Oranges, and Talisman are some of Hatami's works. Iranian women's cinema Following the rise of the Iranian New Wave, there are now record numbers of film school graduates in Iran and each year more than 20 new directors make their debut films, many of them women. In the last two decades, there have been a higher percentage of women directors in Iran than in most countries in the West. Samira Makhmalbaf directed her first film, The Apple, when she was only 17 years old and won the Cannes Jury Prize in 2000 for her following film The Blackboard. The success and hard work of the pioneering Rakhshan Bani-Etemad is an example that many women directors in Iran were following much before Samira Makhmalbaf made the headlines And the current Tahmineh Milani, Niki Karimi.

However, it took many years until it found its way and identity by defining characteristics of Iranian war cinema. Shows the most poematic view on the Iran Iraq war and still after years, is one of the leading films about this historical event from a humanistic aspect, although unlike other Iranian war cinema which are fully supported by the Iranian government this film was made with numerous difficulties. In the past decades, the Iranian film industry has produced many war films. In the Iranian war film genre, war has often been portrayed as glorious and \\"holy\\", bringing out the good in the protagonist and pandering to nationalist sentiments with propagandistic messaging. Tears of Cold and Duel were two films that have gone beyond the traditional view of war. Many renowned directors were involved in developing Iranian war cinema:History of Iranian war cinema * Morteza Avini (Famous TV Documentary: Ravayat-e Fath) * Shahriar Bahrani (Famous film: The Attack on H3) * Mohammad Bozorgnia (Famous film: Jang-e naftkesh-ha) * Ahmad Reza Darvish (Famous film: Duel) * Seifollah Dad (Famous film: Kani Manga) * Samuel Khachikian (Famous film: Eagles) * Ebrahim Hatamikia (Famous films: Mohajer, Az Karkheh ta Rhein, Booy-E Pirahan-E Yusef, The Glass Agency and Che (2014 film)) * Mohsen Makhmalbaf (Famous film: The Marriage of the Blessed) * Rasoul Mollagholipour (Famous films: Safar be Chazabeh & Mim Mesle Madar) * Ali Shah Hatami (Famous film: Akharin Shenasaee) * Kamal Tabrizi (Famous films: Dar Maslakh-e Eshgh & Leily Ba Man Ast) * Kiumars Pourahmad (Famous film: The Night Bus) * Behzad Behzadpour (Famous film: Khodahafez Rafigh) Other films famous and popular Iran Iraq War: Goodbye Life directed by Ensieh Shah-Hosseini, Heeva, Mazrae-ye pedari and Safar be Chazabeh directed by Rasoul Mollagholipour, Kirkuk Operation, Hoor on Fire and Kani Manga directed by Seifollah Dad.

Iranian animations There exist some evidences suggesting that Ancient Iranians made animations. An animated piece on an earthen goblet made 5000 years ago was found in Burnt City in Sistan-Baluchistan province, southeastern Iran. The artist has portrayed a goat that jumps toward a tree and eats its leaves.First Animation of the World Found In Burnt City The first Tehran International Animation Festival was held in 1999, four decades after the time the production of first animation films in Iran. The Second Tehran International Animation Festival was held in February 2001. Apart from Iranian films, animations from 35 foreign countries participated in the festival. The following are among the notable filmmakers of Iranian animated films: * Noureddin Zarrin-Kelk * Bahram Azimi * Ali Akbar Sadeghi Children and youth films Although early attempts also existed, the Iranian children and youth cinema came of age with acclaimed director Mohammad Ali Talebi (b. 1958). He started his career in the 1980s and achieved success beyond Iran with Bag of Rice (1997) and Willow and Wind (2000), whose script was written by Abbas Kiarostami.Mazda Moradabbasi,Don't Miss Your Dreams : Analysis of Mohammad Ali Talebi's Children and Youth Film, Teheran: Farabi Cinematic Foundation, 2012. Talebi believed that producing movies for children and teenagers was a service to ‚Äúthe most fragile and vulnerable of the Iranian society.‚Äù In the 2010s, he became somewhat skeptical about the future of children and youth cinema in Iran, and in 2018 moved to Slovakia.Panps Kotzathanasis, ‚ÄúInterview with Mohammad-Ali Talebi: You can still see works of quality coming out, but I feel these are the last attempts of an era that is vanishing‚Äù, Asian Movie Pulse, June 27, 2019. Timeline of Iranian films *Pre 1960 *1960s *1970s *1980s *1990s *2000s *2010s Influence of Iranians on Other's New Wave Amongst the pioneers of French New Wave were Fran√ßois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol and Eric Rohmer or Barbet Schroeder (born in Tehran, Iran in 1941 where his German geologist Father was on assignment). During the first half of the 20th century, France was the major destination for Iranian students who wished to study abroad. Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Fereydoun Hoveyda was one of them. Fereydoun Hoveyda played a major role in French cultural scene and especially in the field of Cinema, for he was the prot√©g√© of Fran√ßois Truffaut whom he befriended and with whom he helped create the well-known film magazine Les Cahiers du Cin√©ma that spearheaded the French Nouvelle Vague or New Wave Cinema. He also worked closely with Italian film director Roberto Rossellini on several film scripts during that period. Fereydoun Hoveyda was not the only Iranian of his generation to play an active role in promoting the French Cin√©ma d'Auteur. Youssef Ishaghpour is another example. Another Iranian figure in French New Wave was Shusha Guppy a singer, writer and filmmaker who was Jacques Pr√©vert's girlfriend. However, the most important contribution to the French New Wave cinema is that of Serge Rezvani an Iranian poet born in Tehran in 1928. He played a major role as music composer of both Fran√ßois Truffaut Jules et Jim and Jean-Luc Godard Pierrot le Fou, considered as landmarks of French New Wave Cinema. Farah Diba studied at the Beaux Arts and became the focus of attention and the French press was to see her as the new Persian Cinderella. Farah Diba was one of the rare foreign dignitaries to become a permanent member of the French Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. Iranian Robert Hossein (son of legendary musician Aminollah Hossein) started his acting career with his French Armenian friend Chahnour Varinag Aznavourian (known as the famed crooner Charles Aznavour) in the mid fifties essentially type cast as \\"Mr. Tough Guy\\". However he got international acclaim in the early Sixties particularly in Europe, Russia and Asia as the mysterious \\"Jeoffrey, Comte de Peyrac\\" lover of the lovely Mich√®le Mercier in the soft erotic-adventure film series of Ang√©lique Marquise des Anges. In the seventies and eighties he was to play opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo in police thrillers like The Professional. Hossein became known for being a talented theater director and his taste for popular historical vehicles involving large sets and numerous actors. After the resignation of French President Charles de Gaulle, Iranian Anic√©e Shahmanesh became known under the screen name Anic√©e Alvina, playing a French girl in a British film hit called Friends, the music score of which propelled British pop star Elton John. She was also to take on a courageous lesbian role in the screen adaptation of Fran√ßoise Mallet-Joris' novel Le Rempart des B√©guines. Two major documentaries were produced in these years by respectively Agn√®s Varda and the duo Claude Lelouch-Claude Pinoteau. Agn√®s Varda, first to be discovered to young actor G√©rard Depardieu in her 1970 film Nausicaa, directed a love story set in Isfahan (1976) between a French woman (Val√©rie Mairesse) visiting Iran as a tourist and her guide an Iranian Man (Ali Raffi). The film was entitled Plaisir D'Amour en Iran. The romantic film was shot on location in The Masjed Shah. Claude Pinoteau and Claude Lelouch on the other hand shot their documentary just after the Persepolis Celebrations in 1971. They decided to address the urban transformations and cultural emancipation that the country was subject to by the early seventies. Several Iranian expats such as Philippe Khorsand or Persian play writer/actor Yasmina Reza have also gained notice in recent years. The latter is particularly known for her highly intellectual introspections in such plays like Art (Sean Connery bought the film rights advised by his French wife). Music in Iranian cinema Although Iranian composers usually have their own special style and music structure, they all share one thing: melodic, lively rhythms. That might be because they often begin with folkloric songs and shift to film music. In the past few decades, a few composers have emerged in the Iranian cinema with highly appraised works. Composers like Hormoz Farhat, Morteza Hannaneh, Fariborz Lachini, Ahmad Pejman, Majid Entezami, Babak Bayat, Karen Homayounfar, Naser Cheshmazar and Hossein Alizadeh were some of the most successful score composers for Iranian films in the past decades.Music in Iranian cinema Iranian international film festivals Film festivals have a rather long history in Iran that goes back to the 1950s. The first Tehran International Film Festival opened in April 1973. Although the festival never reached the level of Cannes and Venice, however, it managed to become well known as a class A festival. It was a highly reputable festival and many well-known filmmakers took part in it with their films. Great filmmakers such as Francesco Rosi, Michelangelo Antonioni Grigori Kozintsev, Elizabeth Taylor, Pietro Germi, Nikita Mikhalkov, Krzysztof Zanussi, Martin Ritt won the festival's awards.F for Festival Fajr Film Festival The Fajr International Film Festival has taken place since 1983.

Some Iranian films that have been internationally acclaimed are banned in Iran itself. Conversely, some Iranian filmmakers have faced hostility in other countries. Censorship within Iran Dariush Mehrjui's seminal film Gaav (The Cow, 1969) is now considered a pioneering work of the Iranian New Wave. The film was sponsored by the state, but they promptly banned it upon completion because its vision of rural life clashed with the progressive image of Iran that the Shah wished to project, while its prominence at international film festivals annoyed the regime.Steve Nottingham: Early Soviet Cinema After the Iranian revolution, filmmakers experienced more restrictions. Since the mid-1980s, Iran's policy on film censorship has been changed in order to promote domestic film production: the strict censorship eased after December 1987. Old directors resurfaced and new ones emerged. However, the application of the rules is often inconsistent. Several films have been refused release inside Iran, but have been given export permits to enter international film festivals. Even here, the censorship is inconsistent: May Lady by Rakhshan Bani-Etemad (1998) got through but her contribution to Stories of Kish (1999) did not.The new Iranian Cinema All of Jafar Panahi's filmsBlowing the Whistle have been banned from public theaters in Iran. Offside was relegated to \\"a guest slot\\" at the International Fajr Film Festival. \\"It was not shown as an important film\\", says Panahi. \\"They didn't give any value to it.\\" Several of Mohsen Makhmalbaf's films are also banned in Iran. For example, Time of Love and The night of Zaiandeh-rood were banned for dealing with physical love and for raising doubts about the revolution.Iran Chamber Society: Iranian Cinema: Mohsen Makhmalbaf Tahmineh Milani In 2001, feminist filmmaker Tahmineh Milani who made The Hidden Half was jailed because her movie was presumed anti- revolution (against the 1979 Islamic revolution). Many Iranian and international artists and filmmakers demanded her release. After 8 days of Imprisonment, Eventually President Khatami and the Minister of Culture were able to secure her release. In Nargess, Rakhshan Bani-Etemad who is a pioneer among female Iranian film directors, pushes censorship codes to the limits, questioning the morals of society, showing desperate people overwhelmed by social conditions and a couple living together without being married. Abbas Kiarostami was significantly acclaimed in Europe but the Islamic government has refused screening of his films in his own country. Kiarostami's films have been banned in his country for more than 10 years. They are only accessible there through unauthorized DVDs and private screenings. Kiarostami is uncertain what the government dislikes about his films, saying \\"I think they don't understand my films and so they prevent them being shown just in case there is a message they don't want to get out.\\". Despite this, Kiarostami has displayed an extraordinarily benign perspective, at least in recorded interviews: \\"The government is not in my way, but it is not assisting me either. We lead our separate lives.\\" Despite the censorship, Kiarostami insists on working in Iran, saying \\"I think I really produce my best work in Iran.\\" He believes that throughout the ages and all over the world censorship has existed in one form or another and artists have managed to live with this, saying \\"Today, the most important thing is that, although there is censorship, Iranian filmmakers are doing their job and they surpass the difficulties of censorship showing and discussing many things. So why ask me about what's not in the films? It has happened many times that a filmmaker hides a weakness under the excuse of censorship but difficulties have always existed in our lifestyle and our role is to surpass them.\\"Al-Ahram Weekly  Culture  Strategic lies The director Mohammed Rasoulof, was convicted of charges relating to state security and anti-government propaganda. https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/002/2012/en/ In 2009 and 2013 the number of political films and drama like Khers, Guidance Patrol, The Wooden Bridge, I am a Mother and Private Life (Zendegi Khosoosi) were Sanctioned.

Abbas Kiarostami was refused a visa to attend the New York Film Festival, Ohio University and Harvard University in 2002, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Festival director Richard Pena, who had invited him, said: \\"It's a terrible sign of what's happening in my country today that no one seems to realize or care about the kind of negative signal this sends out to the entire Muslim world\\". Finnish film director Aki Kaurism√§ki boycotted the festival in protest. Similarly, Bahman Ghobadi, winner of the Golden Plaque at the Chicago International Film Festival, refused to accept the prize in protest of the U.S. government's refusal to issue him a visa.Gomgashtei dar Aragh (2002) - Awards In 2007, Ahmed Issawi, the abashed Arab director of the New York South Asian Film Festival admitted that a conscious decision was made not to invite any Iranian filmmakers, saying \\"That's a territory I no longer want to tread [...] It's over. Given the whole thing with Iran‚ÄîI refuse to approach it.\\"U.S. Visa Policy Inhumane and Counterproductive Several other Iranian filmmakers have experienced hostilities from other countries. In November 2001 in Afghanistan, Taliban officials, who banned movies and most filmmaking, arrested three of Majid Majidi's crew members who were helping him secretly shoot Barefoot to Herat, a documentary on the country's internal refugees. Samira Makhmalbaf also survived a kidnapping in Afghanistan. {West, Dennis and Makhmalbaf, Mohsen. \\"I Make Cinema in Order to Breathe: An Interview with Mohsen Makhmalbaf\\". Cin√©aste. 34.4, Fall 2009: 10‚Äì15. JSTOR Web. 24 Apr. 2014} In March 2007, a bomb explosion severely injuring several actors and crew members halted production in Afghanistan of Two Legged Horse, the film by Iranian helmer Samira Makhmalbaf. Mohsen Makhmalbaf was the target of two unsuccessful murder attempts when he shot Kandahar in Iran near the Afghan border in 2000, and his daughter Hana was twice the victim of a failed abduction attempt during the shooting of Samira's last film At Five in the Afternoon in the Afghan capital Kabul in 2002.Bomber targets Makhmalbaf  Arresting filmmakers  On 1 March 2010, Jafar Panahi was arrested. He was taken from his home along with his wife Tahereh Saidi, daughter Solmaz Panahi, and 15 of his friends by plain-clothes officers to Evin Prison. Most were released 48 hours later, Mohammad Rasoulof and Mehdi Pourmoussa on 17 March 2010, but Panahi remained in section 209 inside Evin Prison. Panahi's arrest was confirmed by the government, but the charges were not specified. On April 14, 2010, Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance said that Panahi was arrested because he \\"tried to make a documentary about the unrest that followed the disputed 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\\"On 18 May, Panahi sent a message to Abbas Baktiari, director of the Pouya Cultural Center, an Iranian- French cultural organization in Paris, stating that he was being mistreated in prison and his family threatened and as a result had begun a hunger strike. On 25 May, he was released on $200,000 bail while awaiting trial. On 20 December 2010, Panahi, after being convicted for \\"assembly and colluding with the intention to commit crimes against the country‚Äôs national security and propaganda against the Islamic Republic,\\" the Islamic Revolutionary Court sentenced Panahi to six years imprisonment and a 20-year ban on making or directing any movies, writing screenplays, giving any form of interview with Iranian or foreign media as well as leaving the country except for Hajj holy pilgrimage to Mecca or medical treatment. Panahi's colleague, Mohammad Rasoulof also received six years imprisonment but was later reduced to one year on appeal. On October 15, 2011, a court in Tehran upheld Panahi's sentence and ban. Following the courts decision, Panahi was placed under house arrest. He has since been allowed to move more freely but he cannot travel outside Iran. Hossein Rajabian, an Iranian independent filmmaker, After finishing his first feature film, was arrested by Iranian security forces on 5 October 2013 outside his office [in Sari] alongside two musicians, and was transferred to Ward 2-A of Evin Prison where all three of them were held in solitary confinement for more than two months and were threatened with televised confessions. He was released on bail (around $66,000) in mid- December, pending trial. Two years later, his case was heard at Branch 28 of Tehran Revolutionary Court which was presided over by Judge Moghisseh (Summer 2015). He was sentenced to six years in prison and fines for pursuing illegal cinematic activities, launching propaganda against the establishment and hurling insults at sanctities. On appeal, his sentence was changed to three years imprisonment and three years of suspended jail and fines. Hossein Rajabian was sent to the ward 7 of Evin Prison in Tehran. After spending one third of his total period of imprisonment (that is 11 months), he went on hunger strike to protest against unjust trial, lack of medical facilities, and transfer of his brother to another ward called section 8 of the same prison. During the first hunger strike period, which lasted 14 days, he was transferred to hospital because of pulmonary infection and he could not continue his hunger strike because of the interference of the representative of the prosecutor who was sent as an intermediary. After some time, he sent an open letter to the judicial authorities of Iran and went again on strike which brought him the supports of international artists. After 36 days of hunger strike, he could convince the judicial authorities of Iran to review his case and grant him medical leave for the treatment of his left kidney suffered from infections and blood arising out of hunger strike. he, after a contentious struggle with the judicial officer of the prison was sent to the ward 8 for punishment.

They are palm- like, dioecious trees and shrubs native to the Old World tropics and subtropics. Common names include pandan (), screw palm, and screw pine. They are classified in the order Pandanales, family Pandanaceae. Description Aerial, prop roots Often called pandanus palms, these plants are not closely related to palm trees. The species vary in size from small shrubs less than tall, to medium-sized trees tall, typically with a broad canopy, heavy fruit, and moderate growth rate. The trunk is stout, wide-branching, and ringed with many leaf scars. Mature plants can have branches. Depending on the species, the trunk can be smooth, rough, or warty. The roots form a pyramidal tract to hold the trunk. They commonly have many thick stilt roots near the base, which provide support as the tree grows top-heavy with leaves, fruit, and branches. These roots are adventitious and often branched. The top of the plant has one or more crowns of strap-shaped leaves that may be spiny, varying between species from to or longer, and from up to broad. They are dioecious, with male and female flowers produced on different plants. The flowers of the male tree are long and fragrant, surrounded by narrow, white bracts. The female tree produces flowers with round fruits that are also bract-surrounded. The individual fruit is a drupe, and these merge to varying degrees forming multiple fruit, a globule structure, in diameter and have many prism-like sections, resembling the fruit of the pineapple. Typically, the fruit changes from green to bright orange or red as it matures. The fruits can stay on the tree for more than 12 months. Ecology These plants grow from sea level to . Pandanus trees are of cultural, health, and economic importance in the Pacific, second only to the coconut on atolls. They grow wild mainly in semi- natural vegetation in littoral habitats throughout the tropical and subtropical Pacific, where they can withstand drought, strong winds, and salt spray. They propagate readily from seed, but popular cultivars are also widely propagated from branch cuttings by local people. Species growing on exposed coastal headlands and along beaches have thick 'stilt roots' as anchors in the loose sand. Those stilt roots emerge from the stem, usually close to but above the ground, which helps to keep the plants upright and secure them to the ground. While pandanus are distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical islands and coastlines of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, they are most numerous on the low islands and barren atolls of Polynesia and Micronesia. Other species are adapted to mountain habitats and riverine forests. The tree is grown and propagated from shoots that form spontaneously in the axils of lower leaves. Pandanus fruits are eaten by animals including bats, rats, crabs, and elephants, but the vast majority of species are dispersed primarily by water. Its fruit can float and spread to other islands without help from humans. Cultivation and uses Pandanus has multiple uses - dependent in part on each type & location. Some Pandanus are a source of food while others provide raw material for clothing, basket weaving and shelter. Crab claw sail woven from pandan leaves on a tepukei, an ocean‚Äëgoing outrigger canoe from Temotu, Solomon Islands Philippine basket woven from leaves of karagumoy (Pandanus simplex) in the hexagonal kinab-anan pattern Pandanus leaves are used for handicrafts. Artisans collect the leaves from plants in the wild, cutting only mature leaves so that the plant will naturally regenerate. The leaves are sliced into fine strips and sorted for further processing. Weavers produce basic pandan mats of standard size or roll the leaves into pandan ropes for other designs. This is followed by a coloring process, in which pandan mats are placed in drums with water-based colors. After drying, the colored mats are shaped into final products, such as placemats or jewelry boxes. Final color touch-ups may be applied. Pandan cake flavoured with pandan leaf extract Pandan leaves from Pandanus amaryllifolius are used widely in Southeast Asian and South Asian cuisines to add a distinct aroma to various dishes and to complement flavors like chocolate. Because of their similarity in usage, pandan leaves are sometimes referred to as the \\"vanilla of Asia.\\" Fresh leaves are typically torn into strips, tied in a knot to facilitate removal, placed in the cooking liquid, then removed at the end of cooking. Dried leaves and bottled extract may be bought in some places. Sama woman making a traditional mat (tepoh) from pandan leaves in Semporna, Sabah, Malaysia Pandan leaves are known as daun pandan in Indonesian and Malay; dahon ng pandan (lit. \\"pandan leaf\\") or simply pandan in Filipino; ÊñëËò≠ (bƒÅn l√°n) in Mandarin; as ‡πÉ‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏¢ (bai toei; ) in Thai, l√° d·ª©a in Vietnamese; pulao pata in Bengali; and rampe in Sinhalese and Hindi. In Sri Lanka, pandan leaves are used heavily in both vegetable and meat dishes, and are often grown in homes. It is common practice to add a few pieces of pandan leaf when cooking red or white rice as well. In Southeast Asia, pandan leaves are mainly used in sweets such as coconut jam and pandan cake. In Indonesia and Malaysia, pandan is also added to rice and curry dishes such as nasi lemak. In the Philippines, pandan leaves are commonly paired with coconut meat (a combination referred to as buko pandan) in various desserts and drinks like maja blanca and gulaman. In Indian cooking, the leaf is added whole to biryani, a kind of rice pilaf, made with ordinary rice (as opposed to that made with the premium-grade basmati rice). The basis for this use is that both basmati and pandan leaf contains the same aromatic flavoring ingredient, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. In Sri Lanka, pandan leaves are a major ingredient used in the country's cuisine. Kewra (also spelled Kevda or Kevada) is an extract distilled from the pandan flower, used to flavor drinks and desserts in Indian cuisine. Also, kewra or kevada is used in religious worship, and the leaves are used to make hair ornaments worn for their fragrance as well as decorative purpose in western India. Species with large and medium fruit are edible, notably the many cultivated forms of P. tectorius (P. pulposus) and P. utilis. The fruit is eaten raw or cooked. Small-fruited pandanus may be bitter and astringent. Karuka nuts (P. julianettii) are an important staple food in New Guinea. Over 45 cultivated varieties are known. Entire households will move, and in some areas will speak a pandanus language at harvest time. The taste is like coconut or walnuts. Throughout Oceania, almost every part of the plant is used, with various species different from those used in Southeast Asian cooking. Pandanus trees provide materials for housing; clothing and textiles including the manufacture of dilly bags (carrying bags), fine mats or ‚Äòie toga; sails, food, medication, decorations, fishing, and religious uses.

Early life Thompson was born in Bristol on 1 August 1914. His family had links to the theatre. Thompson studied at Dover College then went to work in the theatre, joining the Nottingham Repertory Company as an actor and stagehand. He later went to work for a repertory company in Croydon, Surrey. He wrote plays in his spare time, and had started when he was nine. One of them, Murder Happens? was performed at Croydon in 1934. His second staged play, Double Error, had a brief West End run at the Fortune Theatre in 1935. An article from this time about the play said he had written 40 plays already, including four in between his first two staged plays.Picture Gallery Date: Wednesday, 22 May 1935 Publication: Daily Mail p 19 A company worth ¬£10,000 was formed to exploit Thompson's writings over the next seven years but this appears to have not had a long life. Thompson later said he had written a part for himself to act in but when management asked him if he wanted to do so he said \\"of course not\\" and \\"the die was cast. Later I decided if I didn't have the guts to admit I wanted to play the role I should never act again and I never did.\\" Screenwriter The film rights to Double Error were purchased for ¬£100. Thompson was hired to work in the scriptwriting department at British International Pictures at Elstree Studios. While there he made his one appearance an actor in films, playing a small role in Midshipman Easy (1935). His first credit was The Price of Folly (1937), based on his play. He also worked on the scripts for Glamorous Night (1937) and he worked as dialogue coach on Jamaica Inn (1939), directed by Alfred Hitchcock. He wrote the scripts for The Middle Watch (1940), made at Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) and East of Piccadilly (1941). World War II Thompson served in World War II as a tailgunner and wireless operator in the RAF. In 1942 a revised version of Double Error, titled Murder Without Crime, opened at the Comedy Theatre in London. The play had a run on Broadway in 1943. Post War After the war Thompson returned to his work as scriptwriter under contract at Associated British on such films as No Place for Jennifer (1949) and For Them That Trespass (1949), the latter starring Richard Todd in his debut. Thompson was dialogue director on The Hasty Heart (1949), which turned Todd into a star. He later said he gave up dialogue directing because he found the job \\"impossible. My job was to take stars through their lines but I felt that I was also expected to be a spy for the front office. If a word was altered they wanted to know why. It was a way of keeping control.\\" The same year his play The Human Touch, co written with Dudley Leslie, ran for more than a hundred performances at the Savoy Theatre in a production starring Alec Guinness.Antigone, by Jean Anouilh: New. The Human Touch, by J. Lee-Thompson and Dudley Leslie: Savoy Findlater, Richard. Tribune; Blackpool Iss. 632, (18 February 1949): 22. British film director=Early films His first film as a director was Murder Without Crime (1950), made at ABPC, who put Thompson under contract. Thompson was offered ¬£500 for the screen rights to the play and ¬£500 to direct. He said \\"it was not so much that I wanted to direct movies it was to get the money so I could continue writing plays. But while directing it I got the feeling that I wanted to be a movie director.\\" Thompson said \\"the fact is I found directing to be much easier than writing and I enjoyed it much more than writing as well. So I became a film director.\\" The film was about a man who thinks he has committed murder. Thompson also wrote the screenplay, based on his own play Double Error. In the words of Thompson's Screenonline profile \\"this well structured film went largely unnoticed but contained many of the themes which were to characterise Lee Thompson's work: a good person's struggle with their conscience, an external force of evil, and an out-of- character moment of violence which has long-term consequences. Believing people can \\"commit crimes without being criminals\\", he sought to make his audiences condone or at least understand behaviour that they would normally condemn.\\" Thompson's first film success was one he directed and co-wrote (with Anne Burnaby), The Yellow Balloon (1953), the story of a child who is blackmailed into helping a criminal after accidentally causing his friend's death. He followed it with a comedy, For Better, For Worse (1954) starring Dirk Bogarde, which was even more popular though it is little remembered today. Social Realist films Thompson's fourth film as director The Weak and the Wicked (1954), portrays the lives of women in prison and is based on memoirs by Joan Henry, who became Thompson's second wife. Thompson wrote the script, again in collaboration with Anne Burnaby. It starred Glynis Johns and Diana Dors and was a hit at the box office. The success of the film greatly added to Thompson's prestige and he began to be regarded as one of the leading directors in the country. Thompson was loaned to Rank Films to direct a Jack Buchanan comedy, As Long as They're Happy (1955), co-starring Dors and An Alligator Named Daisy (1955), also starring Dors, along with Donald Sinden. He returned to ABPC and the theme of female prisoners in Yield to the Night (1956), an anti-capital punishment tale with Diana Dors as the condemned prisoner. Thompson later said the \\"pattern\\" of his ABPC films was \\"two pieces of tepid rubbish for one decent project - if I could persuade Robert Clark, who was head of production. He used to wring his hands when I insisted. 'Okay,' he'd finally say. 'Do it if you must. But it won't make money.' I admired him for that really. He did give you a bit of a chance.\\" The Good Companions (1957) was lighter fare, based on a book by J. B. Priestley. According to one obituary Thompson \\"made excellent use of the CinemaScope screen, assembled a fine supporting cast and, with zestful choreography... came up with one of the few successes in a genre for which the British cinema was not noted.\\" Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957), with Yvonne Mitchell, Anthony Quayle and Sylvia Syms and written by Ted Willis, deals with the collapse of a 20-year marriage. Action director Thompson had a big success with Ice Cold in Alex (1958), the story of a British Army unit trekking across North Africa in the Second World War. It featured John Mills, Sylvia Syms, Anthony Quayle and Harry Andrews. It won three BAFTA Awards, including Best British Film. He followed it with North West Frontier (1959), an adventure film set in British India starring Kenneth More and Lauren Bacall. It was one of the most popular films in Britain in 1959. No Trees in the Street (1959) was a thriller written by Willis. Also in that genre was Tiger Bay (1959), starring John Mills. It introduced cinema audiences to Mills' daughter Hayley and German actor Horst Buchholz. Hayley Mills also earned a BAFTA for Most Promising Newcomer portraying a 12-year-old girl who refuses to betray a sailor accused of murder. Thompson followed this with I Aim at the Stars (1960). Hollywood career=Guns of Navarone and Cape Fear Thompson vaulted to international fame with The Guns of Navarone (1961) as a last-minute replacement for director Alexander Mackendrick. His take-charge attitude during its production earned him the nickname 'Mighty Mouse' from lead actor Gregory Peck. Co-star Anthony Quinn said Thompson: > Never read a scene until he had to shoot it and approached each shot on a > whim. And yet the cumulative effect was astonishing. Lee Thompson made a > marvelous picture but how? Perhaps his inventiveness lay in defying > convention, in rejecting the accepted methods of motion picture making and > establishing his own. Perhaps it was in his very formlessness that he found > the one form he could sustain, and nurture, the one form that could, in > turn, sustain and nurture him. Perhaps he was just a lucky Englishman who > pulled a good picture out of his ass. The Guns of Navarone, a Second World War epic filmed on location in Rhodes, Greece, was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Thompson for Best Director. In 1961 he said \\"primarily I am in the business to entertain. This does not mean that I never want to try artistic movies again. But I do not think you can sell art on the big movie circuits. Art belongs in the art houses.\\" Later he said \\"I liked the character bits best\\" about Navarone. \\"Anyone can make an explosion.\\"Anyone can make an explosion Malcolm, Derek. The Guardian3 Feb 1969: 8. The success of Navarone won him entry into Hollywood, where he directed Cape Fear (1962), a psychological thriller with Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Polly Bergen and Lori Martin. Based on a novel called The Executioners by John D. MacDonald, Cape Fear shows how a sex offender can manipulate the justice system and terrorise an entire family. Highly controversial for its time, the film was cut heavily in both the United States and the United Kingdom. He worked on a project with Warren Beatty and Clifford Odets based on an idea of Beattys. It was never made. Neither was The Short Cut which he discussed doing with Daryl F. Zanuck, or The Living Room from a novel by Graham Greene or Chips with Everything by Arnold Wexler. Mirisch Brothers Thompson directed Yul Brynner in the Cossack epic Taras Bulba (1962) for producer Harold Hecht. Thompson was going to follow it with Big Charlie starring Brynner but the movie was not made. In 1962 the Mirisch Brothers signed the director to a four-picture contract. The first made under this was the Mayan Indian epic Kings of the Sun (1963), starring Brynner. In September 1962 Thompson said he would make I Love Louisa with Elizabeth Taylor produced by Arthur Jacobs. (This film became What a Way to Go!(1964) with Shirley MacLaine.) He would put actors under personal contract like Talitha Pol. In September 1963 Thompson announced he had formed a company, Bowhall Productions, to make around four films a year in the $120,000-$160,000 budget range. Thompson said it was \\"unlikely\\" the films would \\"make a profit\\" but they were movies he \\"deeply wanted to make\\". They included Chips with Everything, Rose without a Thorn by Clifford Bax, and a film in Spain. Following Return from the Ashes he would also make a $7 million movie in Africa Thunder of Giants. Instead he did another with MacLaine, John Goldfarb, Please Come Home (1965). Back in England Thompson made Return from the Ashes (1965) for the Mirisch Brothers. In April 1965 Thompson announced he would make High Citadel based on a novel by Desmond Bagley for the Mirisch Brothers. These plans were postponed when Thompson received an offer to replace Michael Anderson, who had fallen ill before he was to start directing a thriller about cults with David Niven, Eye of the Devil (1967) (originally titled 13). High Citadel was never filmed. Another film announced but never filmed was The Case Against Colonel Sutton which he was going to do with producer Martin Poll. Neither was a proposed musical remake of The Private Lives of Henry VIII. After a war film, Before Winter Comes (1968) Thompson was reunited with the star, producer and writer of Navarone in the Western Mackenna's Gold (1969) but it did poorly at the box office. So too did the espionage tale The Chairman (1969) with Gregory Peck. He was meant to follow that with You?, about assassination from a script by Andrew Sinclair.'Chairman' Shot in Crossfire Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times 6 Feb 1969: h13. It was never filmed. \\"I freely admit I've done some pretty bad stuff,\\" he said in 1968. \\"It's entirely my own fault. The trouble was I accepted some dismal scripts. I wasn't tough enough... Writing is the fundamental thing.\\" Some have argued that Thompson's creative decline coincided with the end of his relationship with Henry. Apes Movies Back in the UK he directed Country Dance, also known as Brotherly Love (1970). Thompson's handling of a smaller scale film impressed producer Arthur Jacobs, with whom Thompson had made What a Way to Go; Thompson was the first director attached to the Jacobs production The Planet of the Apes and Thompson says he turned down the first two sequels. He was available to make the fourth and fifth movies in the series, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for the Planet of the Apes. Writer Paul Dehn said Thompson had a reputation as someone with a drinking problem but that he had overcome it by the time of the Apes films. \\"They were cutting back on the budgets the whole time after the first one\\", said Thompson later. \\"It was a bad policy.\\" Later career=US Television Thompson began working more in US television, directing the television films A Great American Tragedy (1972), Huckleberry Finn (1974) starring Jeff East and Paul Winfield, The Reincarnation of Peter Proud (1974) and Widow (1976) as well as the pilot episode of The Blue Knight (1975). He returned to playwriting with Getting Away with Murder (1976).Puzzling plot that breeds indifference Author: John Barber Date: Thursday, July 22, 1976 Publication: The Daily Telegraph (London, England) Issue: 37682 p 13 Charles Bronson In 1976, Thompson started collaborating with actor Charles Bronson, starting with the Warner Bros. crime story St. Ives . John Crowther, who worked with both men, later said Thompson was the total antithesis of Charlie and they got along famously. They really worked well together.‚Äù In 1977, Bronson and Thompson teamed again on an unconventional western called The White Buffalo. Thompson directed two films starring Anthony Quinn, The Greek Tycoon and The Passage. Reviewing the latter The Guardian called Thompson a director who \\"should know better but often doesn't\\".To hell and back and there again The Guardian 1 Mar 1979: 12. The Globe and Mail argued Thompson was \\"possibly the worst experienced director working in the world today.\\" Thompson directed the horror film, Happy Birthday to Me in 1980. In 1981 with Bronson the film Caboblanco had its Los Angeles opening on 24 April. Also that year he directed an episode of the TV show Code Red, which he followed with another Bronson movie, 10 to Midnight. Thompson worked with Bronson again on, The Evil That Men Do (1984) which was shot in Mexico. Thompson was called in to replace original director Fielder Cook, who was fired shortly before filming. Producer Pancho Okhenr sad Thompson \\"knew exactly what shots he needed to put together the film... [Bronson] had a lot of respect for Lee. The whole crew appreciated when the director didn‚Äôt make them work over and over getting the same shot from different angles... He was just a terrific filmmaker.‚ÄùTalbot, Paul. \\"CINEMA RETRO SPECIAL REPORT: PAUL TALBOT ON ... Celebrating Films of the 1960s & 1970s, www.cinemaretro.com, February 01, 2014. Retrieved June 23, 2015. Also released that year was The Ambassador that starred Robert Mitchum. On 22 November 1985, King Solomon's Mines premiered. Thompson directed an Indiana Jones-style pastiche shot in Zimbabwe with Richard Chamberlain and reasonably successful at the box office. On 18 April 1986, Murphy's Law, the Thompson and Bronson collaboration of that year, started its theatrical run. It is a neo-noir thriller film. Acting in the film are Kathleen Wilhoite, Carrie Snodgress, Robert F. Lyons, and Richard Romanus. Thompson tried another Indiana Jones-type tale with Firewalker, which premiered on 21 November. The film paired the actors Chuck Norris with Louis Gossett, Jr. as its leads. The action adventure co-stars Will Sampson and Melody Anderson. Norris and Gossett play Max Donigan and Leo Porter, two soldiers of fortune, whose adventures rarely result in any notable gain. They are befriended by an inscrutable woman of mystery Patricia (Anderson). Patricia's map leads them on a quest for treasure in Central America. The name of the movie comes from the powerful guardian of the treasure. In 1986, Thompson was credited as the director of two Charles Bronson films made by Cannon. On 16 September premiered Messenger of Death and on 6 November Death Wish 4: The Crackdown. He later reflected, \\"I realized these films were not going to enhance my reputation. I had to live with that. You're not going to be offered the great films at a certain age.\\" 3 February 1989, Thompson's final directorial effort was released Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects starring Charles Bronson. In 1990 Thompson moved to Sooke. In 1992 Thompson said he was trying to finance a remake of Tiger Bay with Anna Chumsky and Alec Baldwin. The director said \\"I have certain regrets now. I would rather have stuck to making films like Yield to the Night which had some integrity and importance. But the British film industry caved in. I shouldn't denigrate myself too much because I have enjoyed making my films but I suppose I sort of sold out.\\" In 1998 he worked as a boom operator on the film Bride of Chucky.'Navarone' director was a 'presence': [Final Edition] LOUINN LOTA. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Milwaukee, Wis. [Milwaukee, Wis]04 Sep 2002: 9B. Personal life Thompson was married three times. His first wife was Florence Bailey, whom he married in 1935 when he was 18. They had a son, Peter (1938‚Äì97), who became a film editor on several of his father's films and predeceased him, and a daughter, Lesley, who survived him. They divorced in 1957. His second wife was prisoner and author Joan Henry, whom he married in 1958. They collaborated on Weak and the Wicked and Yield to the Night. He left her for actor Susan Hampshire. In March 1962 Hedda Hopper reported that Thompson was \\"sweating it out\\" in Los Angeles while Henry and Hampshire were \\"awaiting his decision in London.\\" Thompson confirmed this in an interview, while Hampshire and Henry were less forthcoming to the press.For love of two women Author: Jonan Ruddy Date: Friday, 2 Mar. 1962 Publication: Daily Mail p3 In September Hopper reported that it was over between Thompson and Hampshire.

Death Thompson died of congestive heart failure on 30 August 2002, at his holiday home in Sooke, British Columbia, Canada aged 88. Critical appraisal The Guardian obituary called him \\"a compelling craftsman\\". The Washington Post said \\"he directed adventure films noted for their punchy pacing, rich atmosphere and nuanced characterization.\\" Variety said he was \\"Known as a craftsman who had a clear sense of how each film should play, scene by scene\\". The Independent said \\"he lent his acute sense of atmosphere and vivid visual style to a wide range of material. His intimate kitchen-sink melodramas... were unflinching portraits of social realism unusually stark for their time. His thrillers were tautly edited exercises in suspense, and he also made some engaging comedies and a bracing musical...Though his later films can most kindly be labelled potboilers, his body of work in the Fifties and early Sixties was an impressive one.\\" In 2000 he stated that he made so many American films \\"because of my insecurity and effort to stay here. If I was given a script and it had something good in it I'd say, 'Good, I've got my next picture!' That is not the way to make good films, so some of them were good and some not so good.... What an idiot! 'You should have stayed at what you really wanted to make.' If I have anything to say to young directors today it's don't make a film for the sake of making it. Make it only if you really believe in it.

Lee Thompson"},{"id":"1343463","text":", simply known as Pearl, is a multinational corporation based in Japan with a wide range of products, predominantly percussion instruments. History Pearl was founded by Katsumi Yanagisawa -who began manufacturing music stands in Sumida, Tokyo- on April 2, 1946. In 1950, Yanagisawa shifted his focus to the manufacturing of drums and named his company \\"Pearl Industry, Ltd.\\" By 1953, the company's name had been changed to \\"Pearl Musical Instrument Company,\\" and manufacturing had expanded to include drum kits, marching drums, timpani, Latin percussion instruments, cymbals, stands, and accessories. Yanagisawa's eldest son, Mitsuo, joined Pearl in 1957 and formed a division to export Pearl products worldwide. To meet increasing worldwide demand for drum kits following the advent of rock and roll music, in 1961 Pearl built a factory in Chiba, Japan to produce inexpensive drum kits, also known as \\"STENCIL KITS\\" that bore the brand names of more than thirty distributors such as Apollo, Coronet, Maxwin, CB-700, Stewart, Werco, Ideal, Crest, Revelle, Revere, Roxy, Lyra, Majestic, Silvertone, Toreador, WESTBURY and Whitehall. In 1966, Pearl introduced its first professional drum kit, the \\"President Series\\". In the early 1970s, Pearl was distributed in the U.S. by Norlin, the parent company of Gibson guitars at the time. Today, Pearl's Taiwanese operation encompasses five factories whose output supplies nearly the entire worldwide market for Pearl products. The original Chiba factory now caters to the domestic Japanese market, producing drum kits, marching drums, timpani, and symphonic chimes. Adams Musical Instruments are sold in the U.S. through Pearl dealers, Hughes and Kettner guitar and bass amplifiers are distributed through Pearl's main warehouse in Nashville, Tennessee and Sabian cymbals are distributed in Japan through Pearl dealers. Pearl created several drum products, such as shells in the 1970s that were made of wood with a fiber- glass lining. There was also a shell made of a composite called \\"Phenolic.\\" Additionally, Pearl combined roto-toms and these Phenolic shells to create the Vari-Pitch line of drums. Other early innovations included shells that were slightly undersized, so that the drum head would extend over the edges, much like a gong drum. Pearl manufactured seamless, extruded acrylic shells that were different from the tabbed-and-seamed Vistalite shells used by Ludwig. Pearl also developed the hinged tube tom-arm, a design widely copied by many other drum manufacturers. Construction Pearl has made shells for more than 30 companies. In the 1960s, they ceased making shells for other companies, and began manufacturing drums under their own name and used the Pearl logo for the first time. Their construction technique is known as SST or \\"Superior Shell Technology.\\" All Pearl drums feature this construction. Each ply is placed into a cylinder, and pressure is applied from both sides. While in the press, the shell is heated to bring the glue to a boil, thus forcing it through the wood grain and fusing the shells very tightly. The individual plies are scarf jointed, and all the seams are offset, resulting in a \\"seamless\\" drum (Pearl demonstrates the strength by parking a Humvee with its tire on a tom shell).Pearl Drums SST Video (2:57) This creates a drum shell of incredible strength.

The first generation of Export drums were made of 9-ply Philippine mahogany, and the newer were made with 6 plies (7.5mm) of Poplar, with the ECX series being made from maple, and come standard with Pearl's ISS tom mounting system. They were discontinued and replaced by the Vision series (VMX - 6ply maple, VBX - birch, VSX, VX) and later reintroduced in 2013 (as the EXX) to replace the Forum line. *Session - The successor of the World Series, Prestige Session Elite (SLX), Prestige Session (lacquered) and Performance Session (covered) were introduced in 1991.

In 1997 SRX Prestige Session Select replaced SPX and SX line. The shells were 7 ply maple and mahogany. In 2001 SRX Prestige Session Select became the SRX Session Custom, 6-ply all-maple shells with the OptiMount suspension system and 2.3mm SuperHoops II.

They were placed between the Export and DX/DLX kits, and the only differences were tom arms (Worlds came with the TH-80 Tom Holders, whereas the higher series had TH-90 tom holders), and the DX/DLX had super hoops (V1). In 1987, World series replaced DX/DLX series. Shells were 8 ply shells - 2 inner plies were linden, 5 plies mahogany, and 1 outer ply birch. Later shells (from 1989) were 7-ply birch/mahogany.

These drums are made in Taiwan. *Masters Custom (MCX) - Drums made from 6 plies of maple. These drums replace the entire Session and Masters Premium lines until the introduction of the Session Studio Classic, with the only difference being that they feature die-cast hoops, Masters Series lugs, Masters Series OptiMount tom mounts, and Remo drum heads. They are the same configuration as the Masters Premium MRP kits, but they only come in 5 finishes with bright chrome being the only hardware option.

Hardware and Pedals In addition to producing drums, Pearl has also produced hardware for its drum and percussion instruments as well as pedals. One of Pearl's major improvements was the introduction of the Uni-Lock tilter on their tom mounts and cymbal stands.

This was further improved with the introduction of the Gyro-Lock tilters which rotate a full 360 degrees. Most of Pearl's pedals come equipped with PowerShifter heel plates, which allow the player to adjust the pedal's feel by sliding the plate either forwards or backwards.

Muslims travel back and forth between them seven times in what is known as Sa'ee () ritual pilgrimages of ·∏§ajj and Umrah. Muslims walk between the two mountains (called Sa'ee), which they believe was made a ritual as a tribute to Hajar's search for water in the area when she ran out of provisions after Ibrahim left her in the valley upon God's command. The space between the two mountains in which the pilgrims walk is called al-Mas'aa.  Geography  Safa is a small mountain located at the bottom of the Abu Qubais Mountain, about 130 meters (430 ft) southeast of the Ka'bah, which is the beginning of the Sa'ee. As for Marwa, it is also a small mountain of white stone, located 300 meters (980 ft) to the northeast of the Ka'bah and it is connected to Qaiqan Mountain, marking the end of the Sa'ee. Safa, Marwah and the Masa'a (space between the two mountains) were located outside the Masjid al-Haram and were separate until the year 1955/56 (1375 AH), when the project to annex the two sites into the Masjid al-Haram was undertaken for the first time, and they were subsequently annexed. The distance between Safa and Marwa is approximately , therefore, seven trips back and forth amount to roughly .  History = Geological perspective  The individual geological history of the two mountains is relatively unknown. Marwa has been described as smoother and lighter in color than Safa, with some even calling it white, such as Majd ad-Din Ferozabadi, az-Zubaidi, al-Fayoumi. al-Alusi further went on to say that Safa's color was comparable to a tint of red. Safa and Marwa are a part of the Hejaz mountain range, which run parallel to most of the Saudi coast on the Red Sea. The Hejaz themselves are part of the larger Sarawat range, which is characterized by young and jagged mountains.  Islamic narrative  In Islamic tradition, the civilization of Mecca started after IbrƒÅhƒ´m (Abraham) left his son IsmƒÅ øƒ´l (Ishmael) and wife HƒÅjar (Hagar) in the valley, which Muslims believe was a command by God. When their provisions were exhausted, Hajar eventually ran out of food and water and could no longer breastfeed Ismail. She thus ran back and forth seven times between Safa and Marwa hoping to find water. To make her search easier and faster, she went alone, leaving the infant on the ground. She first climbed the nearest hill, Safa, to look over the surrounding area. When she saw nothing, she then went to the other hill, Marwah, to look around. While Hagar was on either hillside, she was able to see Ishmael and know he was safe. However, when she was in the valley between the hills she was unable to see her son, and would thus run whilst in the valley and walk at a normal pace when on the hillsides. Hagar traveled back and forth between the hills seven times in the scorching heat before returning to her son. Allah then sent Angel Jibril (Gabriel) to their aid and a spring of water appeared from the ground. The well was named Zamzam and the journey back and forth Safa and Marwa was made a ritual during Hajj and Umrah. The two mountains are mentioned by name in the Qur'an, in Surah Al- Baqarah (2), verse 158.  Before Muhammad  The early Ansari Muslims gave up the custom of Sa'ee seeing it as idol worship and shirk and a sign of the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (jahiliyyah). It is in this context that Verse 158 of Surah 2 was revealed (Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith 22/23). In another narration by Abdullah Yusuf Ali in his commentary on Verse 2:158, he argues that the verse had been revealed because the pagans of Quraysh had placed two idols atop the two hills and the Muslims felt hesitated to walk between the hills seeing it as idol worship or as an act of shirk. Anas ibn Malik also said that he felt hatred in walking between the two hills as he saw it as a pre-Islamic custom from the jahiliyyah until Allah had revealed Verse 2:158 (Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 2). Aisha confirmed the verse had been revealed with regards to the Ansar. who was it sinful to walk between the hills as they used to visit the idol Manat at Qudaid (near Mecca) in the state of Ihram before going about with the rituals of their pilgrimage in pre-Islamic times. Several similar reasons have been given by multiple scholars of Islam, including al-Suyuti in his Asbab an-Nuzul and George Sale in his Preliminary Discourse to the Quran.  Significance in the Hajj and Umrah  Performing the Sa'ee serves to commemorate Hajar's search for water for her son and God's mercy in answering prayers. Two walkways guide pilgrimes from Safa to Marwa, and from Marwa to Safa, with two narrower walkways in the center to serve elderly and disabled pilgrims. The walkways between the two mountains are collectively called the Mas'aa () and are air-conditioned. Water pumped from the Zamzam Well is also available on the way. Sa'ee is an integral part and rukn of Hajj and Umrah.

It was located on high ground about halfway across the Virginia Peninsula between the James River and York River. Middle Plantation represented the first major inland settlement for the colony. It was established by an Act of Assembly to provide a link between Jamestown and Chiskiack, a settlement located across the Peninsula on the York River.  Overview  Middle Plantation's growth was encouraged by the completion in 1634 of a continuous fortification, or palisade, across the peninsula a distance of about between Archer's Hope Creek (later renamed College Creek), which drained southerly to the James River and Queen's Creek, which drained northerly to the York River. Also in 1634, James City Shire was established by the House of Burgesses to include Middle Plantation and the surrounding area. James City Shire soon thereafter became James City County, the oldest county in the United States. As the small town grew, a new Bruton Parish Church was constructed there. In 1693, Middle Plantation was selected as the site of the new College of William & Mary. After serving as a temporary meeting place several times during contingencies of the 17th century when the Capital of the Colony had been located at Jamestown, Middle Plantation became the new Capital of the Virginia Colony in 1699. It was soon renamed Williamsburg in honor of King William III of Great Britain, and is today the site of the Historic District known as Colonial Williamsburg. Royal Governor Sir Francis Nicholson described Middle Plantation as a place where \\"clear and crystal springs burst from the champagne soil.\\"  Geography  Middle Plantation was located on a ridge at the western edge of a geographic plateau of the Tidewater Region of southeastern Virginia, from which the land of the coastal plain slopes eastward down to sea level at the lower end of the Virginia Peninsula. At this point, the land portion of the Peninsula was relatively narrow between two creeks which drained into the James River and the York River. As much of the lower peninsula to the east was becoming settled, this was a natural point for the English settlers who established Jamestown and the Virginia Colony beginning in 1607 to build a line of defense during early conflicts with the Native Americans.  History = Concept of a defensive palisade across the peninsula  The idea of a palisade or fortification across the peninsula was discussed as early as 1611. Sir Thomas Dale, then governor, in a letter to the Earl of Salisbury, recommended the establishment of a fortified settlement at Chiskiack, some twenty miles (32 km) up the York River from Point Comfort. But, during the era of the marriage of colonist John Rolfe and Native Princess Pocahontas, who were married in 1614, there was a period of peaceful relations with the Natives. Nothing was immediately done to implement the suggestion. The idea of building a palisade was renewed around 1623, following the Indian Massacre of 1622. At that time, 73 of the settlers were slain in Martin's Hundred at Wolstenholme Towne, situated on the James about below Jamestown. The survivors were so alarmed and weakened that they temporarily abandoned the settlement. Governor Francis Wyatt and his Council wrote to the Earl of Southampton that they had a plan of \\"winning the forest\\" by running a pale between the James and York from Martin's Hundred to Chiskiack. In 1626, Samuel Mathews, of Denbigh and William Claiborne, of Kecoughtan, offered to build the palisades and construct houses, at short intervals, between Martin's Hundred and Chiskiack. They attached conditions and costs, and historians do not believe their offer was accepted.  Development along north side of the peninsula  There was little development along the north side of the peninsula adjacent to the York River by the English settlers before 1630, and no action on a cross-peninsula palisade had taken place. Under Governor John Harvey, at a meeting held at Jamestown, October 8, 1630, Governor Harvey and the Governor's Council, > \\"for the securing and taking in a tract of land called the forest, bordering > upon the cheife residence of ye Pamunkey King, the most dangerous head of ye > Indyan enemy,\\" did \\"after much consultation thereof had, decree and sett > down several proportions of land for such commanders, and fifty acres per > poll for all other persons who ye first yeare and five and twenty acres who > the second yeare, should adventure or be adventured to seate and inhabit on > the southern side of Pamunkey River, now called York, and formerly known by > the Indyan name of Chiskiack, as a reward and encouragement for this their > undertaking.\\" Under this order, houses were built on both sides of King's Creek, and extended rapidly up and down the south side of the York River. By September, 1632, population on the south side of the York River had become considerable enough to claim two representatives in the General Assembly. Chiskiack and York The region on the York River was divided into two plantations, one retaining the old name, Chiskiack (an Indian name), and the other to be named York. The latter was settled by Sir John Harvey at the mouth of Wormeley's Creek, about three miles (5 km) below the present Yorktown. Years later, Captain Nicholas Martiau, a French engineer employed by the colony, patented the land embracing the site of Yorktown. When, in 1680, the General Assembly authorized the establishment of 10 ports, it directed that one be here, between the two settlements of Chiskiack and York. Thus, the town of Yorktown at once assumed importance. Soon, both Chiskiack and York became two of the lost towns of Virginia.  1632: Middle Plantation patented  The plan of running a palisade across the peninsula was no longer deferred. Dr. John Potts blazed the way by obtaining on July 12, 1632 a patent for at the head of Archer's Hope Creek, midway between Chiskiack and the James River. On September 4, 1632, the General Assembly directed that land should be offered to all persons settling between Queen's Creek and Archer's Hope Creek, as it had been offered two years before to inhabitants at Chiskiack. In February, 1633, the Assembly enacted that a fortieth part of the men in \\"the compasse of the forest\\" east of Archer's Hope and Queen's Creek to Chesapeake Bay (essentially all of the lower peninsula) should be present \\"before the first day of March next\\" at Dr. John Potts' plantation, \\"newlie built,\\" to erect houses and secure the land in that quarter. Work on the palisade had commenced by March 1, 1633. With this labor, palisades, six miles (10 km) in length, were run from creek to creek, and, on the ridge between, a settlement to be called Middle Plantation was made. It represented the first major inland settlement for the colony.  A healthful site chosen for Middle Plantation  The doctor would have certainly recognized the sanitary advantages of the country around Middle Plantation. As the ridge between the creeks was remarkably well drained, there were few mosquitoes. The deep ravines penetrating from the north and south made the place of much strategic value. Also, the only practical road down the Peninsula was over this ridge, and this road was easily defended. At Middle Plantation, some years later, this road was later to be called Duke of Gloucester Street.  1634: Palisade across the Peninsula completed  By 1634, the palisade (or stockade) was completed across the Virginia Peninsula, which was about wide at that point between Queen's Creek which fed into the York River and Archer's Hope Creek, (since renamed College Creek) which fed into the James River. The new palisade provided some security from attacks by the Native Americans for colonists' farming and fishing lower on the Peninsula. The palisade is partially described in the following extract from a letter written in 1634, from Jamestown, by Captain Thomas Yonge: > a strong palisade ... upon a streight between both rivers and ... a > sufficient force of men to defence of the same, whereby all the lower part > of Virginia have a range for their cattle, near fortie miles in length and > in most places twelve miles (19 km) broade. The pallisades is very neare six > miles (10 km) long, bounded in by two large Creekes. ... in this manner to > take also in all the grounde between those two Rivers, and so utterly > excluded the Indians from thence; which work is conceived to be of > extraordinary benefit to the country ...  1635-1693: life at Middle Plantation  As Middle Plantation was developed midway between the heads of Queens Creek and Archer's Hope (later renamed College Creek), settlers moved into the region in considerable numbers, establishing homesteads. Among these was Rich Neck Plantation. Not much is known of the early years of the settlement; the palisades made it a place of refuge from Indian attack. On April 27, 1644, the second major Indian massacre occurred in the Colony. At that time, the Chief of the Powhatan Confederacy, Opechancanough, was captured. Although this event was to represent the high-water mark of hostilities with the Natives, in 1646, Captain Robert Higginson was directed to run a new pale at Middle Plantation, as the old was out of repair. By the 1650s, Middle Plantation began to look both populated and wealthy. Colonel John Page, a merchant who had emigrated from Middlesex, England with his wife Alice Lucken Page in 1650, was largely responsible for building Middle Plantation into a substantial town. In an era of wooden buildings, brick was a sign of both wealth and permanence. Page built a large, brick house in Middle Plantation and began encouraging the growth of the area. The Ludwell brothers (Thomas and Phillip) also built a substantial brick home, even larger than that of Page., College of William and Mary The houses which Page and the Ludwells built were among the finest in the colony. The Pages' eldest son, Francis built another brick house nearby. By the third quarter of the seventeenth century, Middle Plantation began to look like a place of importance.  Bacon's Rebellion  During Bacon's Rebellion (1675), Middle Plantation was second only to Jamestown as the center of the political upheaval. On August 3, at the house of Major Otho Thorpe at Middle Plantation, Nathaniel Bacon held a convention of the leading men, including four councillors. They adopted resolutions stressing independence from the people in power. The people pledged themselves to resist the Royal Governor, Sir William Berkeley to the utmost, and to oppose any force sent out from England. Historians note that it was a struggle for power between Bacon and his followers and the more established settlers represented by Berkeley. During the resulting conflict, Governor Berkeley retreated to the Eastern Shore. After Bacon died of natural causes later that year, Berkeley soon regained power and returned to the Peninsula. After Bacon's death and the suppression of his followers, Middle Plantation was the site of the execution of William Drummond. Berkeley suggested he may have been \\"the original cause of the whole Rebellion.\\" The same day on which Drummond was executed, the rebel Jean Baptista, a Frenchman, was also hanged there. Berkley also hanged many other colonists who had been involved in the uprising. Upon learning of the many executions, King Charles II was so displeased by the scale of retaliation that he recalled the Royal Governor to England. During the Rebellion, most of Jamestown was burned to ground. The House of Burgesses had to temporarily move to Middle Plantation while the reconstruction of the old parliament house was underway.  Peace with the Natives  Succeeding Berkeley on May 5, 1677, Acting Governor Sir Herbert Jeffryes invited the weroances of the neighboring Indian tribes to his camp to seek a lasting peace. On May 29, 1677, King Charles II's birthday, attendees included the queen of the Pamunkey, her son, Captain John West; the queen of the Weyanoke, the king of the Nottoways,King Shurenough of the Manakins (Monacans), and the king of the Nansemonds. By the articles which they all signed, the Indian leaders agreed to live in due submission to the English people. As a guarantee of good treatment, Jeffryes presented each of them with a coronet or frontlet adorned with false jewels. (One of the frontlets, presented to the queen of Pamunkey, is now held by the Virginia Historical Society). As Bacon's forces had destroyed the statehouse and all other buildings at Jamestown, the first General Assembly summoned after the rebellion was held in February, 1677, at Berkeley's residence, Green Spring Plantation. In October, the assembly met at Major Otho Thorpe's house in Middle Plantation. That year, the Assembly discussed idea of moving the capital from Jamestown, but instead rebuilt the state house at Jamestown.  Churches, Bruton Parish  In 1633, shortly after Middle Plantation was established, a parish of the Church of England with the same name, Middle Plantation Parish was established. The colonists soon built a wooden church. In 1644, Harrop Parish in James City County became active, and it united with Middle Plantation Parish in 1658 to form Middletown Parish. Marston Parish, founded in 1654 in adjacent York County merged with Middletown Parish in 1674 to form the new Bruton Parish. Bruton Parish Church (circa 1902) The name \\"Bruton Parish\\" honored the prominent Ludwell family and Governor Sir William Berkeley, whose ancestral homes were at Bruton in Somerset, England. Reverend Roland Jones was the first minister of Bruton Parish. In 1678, Colonel John Page (Middle Plantation), a wealthy colonist, donated a plot of land about by and funds for building a brick church and for the surrounding churchyard at Middle Plantation.Bruton Parish Church, Hesperides, 2007 Other subscribers pledged additional funds. About by , and the brick church was completed in 1683 and dedicated the next year at the Epiphany. The first brick Bruton Parish Church was of Gothic design with supporting buttresses. Soon the vestry authorized a steeple and a ring of bells. Royal approval of the structure came in 1694 when the Governor, Sir Edmund Andros, gave the parish a large silver server (paten). The church was replaced by a larger building finished in 1715 which is still extant.\\"History\\" , Bruton Parish Official Website, accessed 2 Apr 2010  1693: The College of William & Mary  After years of campaigning, a long-sought dream of the colonists came to fruition in 1693 following a mission to London by the Reverend Doctor James Blair, the highest ranking representative of the Church of England in the colony. Blair returned with the charter for a new college, and selected land adjacent to Middle Plantation as the site. There they established The College of William & Mary, named for the reigning King and Queen of England. The College opened in temporary buildings in 1694. It was given a seat in the House of Burgesses and was supported by taxation of a penny per pound on tobacco exported from Maryland and Virginia. Sir Christoper Wren Building, formerly known as the College Building, was built between 1695 and 1699 and remains the oldest academic building in continuous use in the United States.  1699: named the new capital of the Virginia Colony  On October 20, 1698, the statehouse (capitol building) in Jamestown burned for the fourth time. Once again removing itself to a familiar alternate location, the legislature met at Middle Plantation, this time in the new College Building. While meeting there, a group of five students from the College of William and Mary submitted a well-presented and logical proposal to the legislators outlining a plan and good reasons to move the capital permanently to Middle Plantation. Despite the periodic need to relocate to Middle Plantation, throughout the seventeenth century, Virginians had been reluctant to move the capital from its \\"ancient and accustomed place.\\" After all, Jamestown had always been Virginia's capital. It had a state house (except when it periodically burned) and a church, and it offered easy access to ships that came up the James River bringing goods from England and taking on tobacco bound for market. However, the students argued that the change would escape the dreaded malaria and mosquitoes that had always plagued the Jamestown site. The students pointed out that, while not located immediately upon a river, Middle Plantation offered nearby access to two deepwater (6-7' depth) creeks leading to a choice of two rivers. Other advocates of the move included the Reverend Dr. Blair and Sir Francis Nicholson. Nicholson succeeded Sir Edmund Andros as governor of Virginia. The earlier work of several prominent individuals like John Page, Francis Page, Thomas Ludwell, Philip Ludwell, and Otho Thorpe in building their fine brick homes and creating a substantial town at Middle Plantation also played a major role. And, there was of course, the new College of William and Mary with its fine brick building. The proposal for the move was received favorably by the House of Burgesses. In 1699, the capital of the Virginia Colony was officially relocated to Middle Plantation.  Renamed as Williamsburg  About the same time the Capital was moved, Middle Plantation was renamed Williamsburg by the Governor, Colonel Francis Nicholson, in honor of King William III of Great Britain. The new site was described by Governor Nicholson as a place where \\"clear and crystal springs burst from the champagne soil.\\" Williamsburg remained the capital of Virginia until 1780.
