Hyperreligiosity generally includes abnormal beliefs and a focus on religious content or even atheistic content, which interferes with work and social functioning. Hyperreligiosity may occur in a variety of disorders including epilepsy, psychotic disorders and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Hyperreligiosity is a symptom of Geschwind syndrome, which is associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. Also a generalized behavioral tendency, or thought modality caused or attributed to learned behaviors and thought distortons connected to cultic abuse. Or strong sectarian indoctrination as to influence cognition and or causal to frequent thought distortions, often marked with irrational or ablative reasoning. Signs and symptoms Hyperreligiosity is characterized by an increased tendency to report spiritual, religious or mystical experiences, religious delusions, rigid legalistic thoughts, and extravagant expression of religiosity. Hyperreligiosity may also include religious hallucinations. Hyperreligiosity can also be common among individuals who have intense atheistic beliefs. Pathophysiology and cause Hyperreligiosity may be associated with epilepsy ‚Äì in particular temporal lobe epilepsy involving complex partial seizures ‚Äì mania, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, hallucinogen related psychosis and psychotic disorder. In persons with epilepsy episodic hyperreligosity may occur ictally or postictally, but is usually a chronic personality feature that occurs interictally. Hyperreligiosity was associated in one small study with decreased right hippocampal volume.

It has a single hairy leaf and one, two or sometimes three small creamy-white flowers, usually with the lateral sepals and petals curving around the ovary and crossing each other. It is a rare orchid, only found in the extreme south-east of the state. Description Caladenia dorrienii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which grows in clumps. It has a single, erect, narrow linear, hairy leaf, long and wide. One, two or sometimes three white to creamy-white flowers are borne on a stalk tall. The flowers are long and wide. The sepals and petals are relatively short, greenish-white with red lines and dark glandular tips. The dorsal sepal is erect and the lateral sepals and petals usually curve downwards and cross each other. The labellum is pale white, relatively broad and has smooth to slightly toothed edges. Along its centre line there are two rows of white or pale red-tipped calli. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia dorrienii was first formally described by Karel Domin in 1912 from a specimen collected by Arthur Dorrien-Smith near Bridgetown. The description was published in Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany. The specific epithet (dorrienii) honours the collector of the type specimen. Distribution and habitat The Cossack spider orchid is only found in scattered communities between Kojonup and Boyup Brook and near West Dale in the Avon Wheatbelt and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions where it grows in moist clay soils amongst dense small plants in wandoo woodland.

Its mission is to train Cadets in basic military leadership and commission them as 2nd Lieutenants upon the completion of a bachelor's degree. Founded in 1873, the ROTC Battalion has continued to serve the nation and US Army Cadet Command and was given the nickname, \\"The West Point of the West\\" after it produced more commissioned officers than any other ROTC Battalion in the USA during World War II. Pre-Civil War Prior to the American Civil War, the small number of officers the Army needed was provided by the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and a few other colleges, such as Norwich University. With the expansion of the Army to unprecedented size for the Civil War, the need for trained officers quickly exceeded the number available. As a result, Congress passed the Land Grant Act of 1862, which specified that courses in military tactics should be offered at colleges established as a result of the Act. Corvallis College (now Oregon State University) was founded in 1858 as an academy supported by the Methodist Church. 1868‚Äì1906; educating the citizen soldier Corvallis College was named a Land-Grant institution in 1868, and thus was required to begin teaching military science. The first students were described as \\"being fine of muscle and brain but had to be taught to read and do simple arithmetic,\\" perhaps explaining why military training did not begin immediately. A new college president, Benjamin Lee Arnold, a Confederate veteran, arrived in the spring of 1872 \\"prepared to take charge of neglected military tactics as soon as arms arrived.\\" Captain Benjamin D. Boswell of the 11th Infantry Regiment (and had served with the 4th West Virginia Infantry during the Civil War) was on extended leave and had been voluntarily helping with the Cadets. In September 1873, he was \\"regularly retained as Professor of Military Science.\\" CPT Boswell wrote about three difficulties: \\"There was sometimes no suitable room for drilling, there were no books on military science in the city, and that the boys were farmer's sons they went home on good days to help with the planting and harvesting when the weather was best for drilling.\\" For about four years a varied collection of blue uniforms were worn until 1876, when President Arnold arranged for a local tailor to have the first official Cadet uniforms made. Gray, with caps of the Civil War type, it has long been speculated that they were inspired by Arnold's Confederate background, or perhaps from the \\"long gray line\\" of the US Military Academy at West Point. Each Cadet purchased his own for $16 to $18, depending on size. Education in military tactics continued until 1877 when all guns were taken for the Nez Perce Wars, so \\"drill was not among the college activities of the time.\\" In 1884, college president Arnold made a passionate plea to the legislature for 60 to 70 guns to replace those taken and never returned. Finally, in 1886, guns and a cannon were sent from Fort Vancouver and drill and military tournaments began again. A Cadet band was organized in 1891 consisting of 13 pieces obtained by private subscription. The new band, together with two companies of Cadets, marched down the railroad station to perform when President William Henry Harrison arrived on the Presidential train. The second Regular Army officer, 1LT C. F. Dentler, was detailed by the War Department as Professor of Military Science in 1894. When he arrived, he was put in charge of Cauthorn Hall (now Kidder Hall), a dormitory known for the unruly behavior of its occupants. It is reported that \\"he put in operation War Department rules for behavior. In a short time Cauthorn was an orderly place, and every student was getting better grades in his classwork.\\" That summer (1894), the Cadets marched in the Portland, Oregon parade and were very popular with the 1st Oregon soldiers who \\"swarmed them to get all manner of drinks,\\" since they were they only military unit carrying canteens. Uniforms returned to 'army blue' in 1896 after a vote of the Cadets. In 1898, all regular officers and National Guard officers were needed on active duty for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Lieutenant Woodbridge Geary, US Army, who'd been Professor of Military Science for two years, was killed in the Philippine Islands. The Cadet Battalion of 1901 commemorated his service with a marble slate. In 1898, the Mechanical Hall, which held all the military equipment, burned down, destroying everything. Later that year, Major Edwards of the Oregon National Guard, arrived fresh from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War to head the military program. He instituted many changes: New Springfield rifles; the first Armory (now Mitchell Playhouse) was built; encampments were introduced. These three day encampments were conducted four miles southwest of Corvallis and became community affairs. City merchants brought out crates of oranges for the Cadets and visitors came to the camp, \\"an enjoyment long to be remembered.\\" 1906‚Äì1941; an era of growth 1LT D.P. Quinlan, 5th Cavalry, US Army, had arrived as the new Professor of Military Science in 1905. By this time there were four companies of infantry, with detachments of field artillery, Cavalry, Engineers, Signal, and Hospital Corps and a 28-piece band. The blue uniform changed to olive drab, handsome with a black visored cap, white gloves and puttees. The college insignia was worn on it, and an orange hat band and orange breast cord were added for dress. The buttons had OAC on them, for the then Oregon Agricultural College. Two historic leaders were at OAC during this period: College President William Jasper Kerr, who was far seeing in his objectives and believed in the distribution of responsibility; and Captain Ulysses G. McAlexander, whose record as a commandant and soldier was outstanding. McAlexander was commandant and professor of Military Science and Tactics from 1907‚Äì1912, and again from 1915‚Äì1916. While at OAC, he increased the battalions to four, and replaced the old Springfield rifles with the then modern Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen rifles, securing 720 of them for the 700 Cadets. The military band was increased to 60 pieces and played at commencements. Captain H. L. Beard, long their conductor, took the band to the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California, where they played for a month, bringing much acclaim to Oregon State. With the increasing size and popularity of the Cadet regiment, the Oregon Legislative Assembly passed an act providing for the construction of the present armory. Completed in 1910, the Armory was one of the largest and finest in the country. The 100 x 300 ft. riding hall allowed the Cadets to practice on horseback in all kinds of weather. The Cadets placed a bronze tablet, dedicating the building on 12 June 1911, to McAlexander \\"In Appreciation of whom, we the members of the Cadet Regiment of 1911, have placed this plate.\\" It can be seen today on the north wall of the building. In World War I, Major McAlexander became world-famous as the \\"Rock of the Marne,\\" while leading the 38th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division, and later as a Major General who commanded the \\"Texas\\" Brigade of the 90th Infantry Division. He was also awarded the military's second highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross. By 1917, the military instruction had become so efficient that the War Department classified OAC as a \\"Distinguished College.\\" Regular training was discontinued during World War I and the Student Army Training Corps (SATC) was established in 1918 (distinct from ROTC) to meet the demands for officers in the war. In this accelerated program there were over 3,000 students carrying 14 hours of collegiate work weekly (principally in engineering) besides their military subjects. The National Defense Act of 1916 had established the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and in January 1919, after the war ended, military training was reestablished as ROTC. Five major departments were organized: Infantry, Field Artillery, Engineering, Motor Transport, and Cavalry. Polo teams were begun, coached by the ROTC officers. In the 1930s, the rifle team won the \\"Doughboy of the West\\" trophy; the college continued to be rated \\"Distinguished College\\" by the War Department; and polo matches against schools such as Stanford University kept Oregon State ROTC in the limelight. The ROTC band became two separate bands and presented over 200 weekly broadcasts on KOAC, Military Balls added to the glamour. However, an era was ending. The Cavalry dismounted in the mid-30s and horses were dispensed with entirely in 1937, when the field artillery \\"heavy horses\\" were replaced by motor vehicles. 1941‚Äì1945; a nation at war Oregon State College was referred to as the \\"West Point of the West\\" during these years. More Cadets were commissioned than at any other non-military academy in the United States. In 1942, there were 1,683 ROTC Cadets. 110 officers were commissioned that year and went immediately into service. By 1945 more Cadets were commissioned than at any other school in the West. Enlistments lowered ROTC enrollments drastically during the war years, but in March 1943, an Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) came into existence to provide troop technical training in engineering, communications, and languages. A student from those years remembers that at the beginning of the war all the young men were immediately put into uniform. Most of them were absorbed elsewhere, but the engineers stayed, later to be joined by ASTP groups. In all, over 2,000 men were trained at the University while about 9,000 graduates and former students, many of them had their military training at Oregon State, served on active duty during World War II. 1946‚Äì1978; educating for global involvement After the Second World War ended in 1945, a Department of Naval Science was added at Oregon State. Providing officer training for the both the US Navy and the US Marine Corps, it is now one of the largest in the nation and has earned the unofficial title \\"Naval Academy of the Northwest.\\" Women were admitted to the Naval program for the first time in 1972, and over 1,000 Navy and Marine officers have been commissioned since the beginning of the program. The US Air Force was established in 1948, with the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947. On 1 July 1949, the US Army Air Corps training branch became a separate officer training unit now known as Aerospace Science. The Air Force ROTC draws more freshmen scholarships than any other AFROTC unit in the nation and has had over 1,000 officers commissioned, including the first women in 1970. In 1977, two graduates of the OSU AFROTC became the first women pilots in the Air Force. Today, the Army and Air Force ROTC programs at the University share the McAlexander Fieldhouse. The Army ROTC, from its beginning in 1917, had commissioned enough officers to make Oregon State the leader in the nation among non-military schools. In 1973, women were admitted to Army ROTC. Now the ROTC has very little military drill and the emphasis is on leadership training and general professional education. Military training has changed tremendously since the early drills on muddy grounds near Benton Hall. In 1962, ROTC was changed from mandatory participation for physically able male students to a completely voluntary program. In 1964, the ROTC Vitalization Act brought scholarships and financial aid to a streamlined ROTC program, and OSU attracts more scholarship winners than of any other school of its size in the nation. Leadership, scholasticism, technical, and scientific training are emphasized, as well as physical fitness. During this era, Cadets attending Western Oregon University and the Oregon State University Cascades Campus also became members of the Beaver Battalion and train with them during labs and field training exercises. With over one hundred years of history, Army ROTC at Oregon State University and its partner schools continues to train junior officers and commission them into various fields of the Army.

Mazique (October 2, 1913 ‚Äì September 18, 2007) was an activist who helped found the Capital Transit campaign with United Federal Workers to integrate Washington D.C.'s bus operators. Mazique wrote extensively for The Washington Afro-American newspaper on topics such as the United Nations position on African Nations, and how black children were being educated in DC schools. She served on the National Council for the Southern Negro Youth Congress in 1945, a group claimed to be a Communist front organization. She was the subject of a U.S. Government Office Of War Information documentary photo series in 1942 while she was a clerk at the Library of Congress. The photos, taken by John Collier, were supposedly depicting a day in the life of a typical black Washingtonian but critics argued the photos were \\"less picturesque and less a credit to freedom's national seat\\" than a typical day of an average black woman in Washington D.C. Mazique graduated from Spelman College and received a Masters in African Studies from Howard University where she wrote her thesis on the development of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Mazique argued her own acrimonious divorce case despite the court's requests to take legal counsel. She kept her children, but lost her case for personal financial support.Mazique v. Mazique, Open Jurist. Retrieved January 21, 2017. Personal life Dr Mazique and Jewel Mazique and \\"one of their nieces whom they are rearing\\" Mazique was married to Edward Craig Mazique in 1937, separated in 1961, and divorced in 1965. They had two sons, Edward and Jeffrey. Jeffrey was the first black child to attend kindergarten at the Sidwell Friends School in 1956. As a direct result, Senator James Eastland, an anti-integrationist from Mississippi, withdrew his son from the school. Jewell Mazique preferred to be involved with social causes more than having a social life, stating in an interview, \\"The frills of social life hold no charms for me, I am more concerned for instance with what the political leaders of Paris decided to do about their colonial possessions than what the Paris designers decide about what women will wear. Divorce Mazique decided that her marriage to Edward could not continue although she did waver in her decision. Eventually Edward started divorce proceedings on the grounds of desertion. Mazique hired a number of lawyers before she decided that she could do a better job herself. The divorce was very public and at one point Jewell's friends appeared with placards outside the Park Sheraton Hotel in Washington in support of her divorce case. The location was chosen as Marguerite Belafonte had a fashion show there and she was seeing Edward Mazique. One placard read \\"Let not justice be rationed to Jewell R. Mazique in the Domestic Relations Court\\". Jewell's friend wrote to the newspapers and they formed a committee to support her. The case was settled in her husband's favour and it was noted that Jewell had argued her own case despite the court's advice.

She campaigned for free, compulsory, secular education for all and for free school meals. Early life and education Bridges-Adams was born at Maesycwmmer, Bedwas, Monmouthshire, south Wales, the daughter of a Welsh engine-fitter William and his wife Margaret. The family later moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne and after working at schools in Newcastle, Bridges-Adams studied at the University of London and in 1882 was awarded a distinction at Bedford College, London, in Greek and Maths. She married Walter Bridges-Adams on 22 October 1887. Career Bridges- Adams's early career was as a teacher in schools in Birmingham and in London, and she was also the headmistress of a board school (a type of free elementary school established by the Elementary Education Act 1870). In 1894 she stood for election to the London School Board, representing the Greenwich division, supported by the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society, trade unions (the Gas Workers' Union, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers) and the London Nonconformist Council. She failed to be elected, but was successful three years later, and was re-elected in 1900 as the sole Independent Labour Party candidate, with an increased majority, remaining a member of the board until its abolition. The school boards were then one of the few elected bodies of the United Kingdom on which women could serve. In 1900, she was involved in the opening of a Fr√∂bel-influenced free \\"kindergarten\\" in Woolwich, London; this was the first such educational establishment in England. With the closing of the school boards, she became secretary to Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, and with her continued campaigning. In 1905, the two led a motor tour of the country to promote the concept of free school meals. Bridges-Adams founded the first 'Open Air School for Recovery' (which aimed to show the \\"therapeutic effects of open air and regular meals on debilitated children\\") in Bostall Woods, London in 1907 and another on Shooter's Hill, London, the following year. She supported adult education for workers through the Plebs League and the Central Labour College, and founded the Working Women's Movement. Outside of her education-related campaigning, Bridges-Adams was also involved in other causes. She fought for improved living conditions of working class women: as a member of her local Woolwich Women's Co-operative Guild, she campaigned for improved housing and sanitation, and for the building of cultural facilities such as a picture gallery and a free library. In 1917, alongside Joseph King (a Member of Parliament) and Lord Edward Stanley (a peer and former member of the London School Board), she campaigned for the continuation of the right of asylum for refugees from the Russian Empire. Personal life On 22 October 1887, the then Mary Daltry married Walter Bridges Adams, the son of William Bridges Adams. Together they had one son, William Bridges-Adams (1889‚Äì1965). Her husband predeceased her, dying in 1902. Her husband's family paid for her son to attend Bedales School, a progressive private school. Though this may have conflicted with her own views about education, sending her son to a fee-paying boarding school was likely the only way she could have continued her activism as a single-parent.

It was a body of mounted irregulars, mostly cowboys and ranchers from the area around Fort Macleod (District of Alberta), the headquarters of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) located at the base of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, about west of Medicine Hat (in what was then the District of Assiniboia). This unit is not to be confused with the present-day Canadian Army Reserve unit The Rocky Mountain Rangers of Kamloops, British Columbia. Rather, it is the ultimate ancestor of the South Alberta Light Horse (SALH). The campaign against Riel in North West Canada was put under the command of Major-General Frederick Middleton, a British-born commander of the Canadian Militia, who had seen extensive military service. Middleton did not trust the newly formed Canadian Militia cavalry troops from Eastern Canada, as they had little experience, and had no feel for the ground on which they were to patrol. Instead, Middleton took the advice given to him by the Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, who suggested that he recruit local troops, who would be \\"much more serviceable than town-bred men who compose our cavalry.\\"Graves, Donald E. (2005). Century of Service: The History of the South Alberta Light Horse. Toronto: Robin Brass Studio. p. 29. The main purpose of the RMR was to fight as a mounted cavalry against either discontented Canadian First Nations, or border-jumping American warriors. They were to supplement patrols of the NWMP and provide security to the railroad construction crews. Major John Stewart, 1885Commanded by John Stewart, a rancher turned militia officer from the Fort Macleod area, the RMR was a microcosm of local citizens, stockmen, trappers, politicians and discharged Mounties hammered into an irregular cavalry unit. Stewart was directed in early March 1885 to organize \\"four units of Rocky Mountain Rangers\\". Stewart was in immediate communication by telegraph with former military contacts back home, as he was visiting family in Ottawa when news of the Metis uprising reached him. He quickly began the task of organizing the units. There were 114 members led by Major Stewart. The members were to supply their own mounts, tack and sidearms but since this last resulted in a variety of questionable weapons, Major Stewart arranged for the issuance of some NWMP rifles including a few of the obsolete single shot Snider‚ÄìEnfield .577 and 40 of the new 1876 .45-75 Winchesters.Edward N. Baker, RMR, 1885 Number 3 Troop of the RMR remained in the Fort Macleod area as a home guard, but Number 1 and 2 Troops were sent to Medicine Hat, a very strategic point where the newly built Canadian Pacific Railway bridged the South Saskatchewan River ‚Äì the largest physical obstacle on its entire route between Winnipeg and the Rocky Mountains. Seizure or destruction of the bridge at that point would have played havoc with continued effective use of the railway, which was of immense help in transporting men, equipment and supplies. The RMR's main task was to patrol the region of southern Alberta and western Assiniboia, in the Cypress Hills region. As events unfolded quite rapidly in the North-West Rebellion near Batoche and Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, a fair distance north of the Cypress Hills, it soon became apparent that the Rangers were not going to be directly involved in that fighting. Still, there were a couple of incidents in which the Rangers took action. The first was on 19 May 1885, when a cattle herder was attacked by First Nations and M√©tis warriors, and the second was in early June when a patrol near the Cypress Hills came under attack. So, while not directly involved in the main fighting in Saskatchewan, the Rangers were always aware that trouble could have developed farther south, and the presence of the Rangers helped keep the peace and provide assurance to the local settlers.http://www.rockymountainrangers.ca/?p=full The 1885 RMR were disbanded on 17 July that year. There was probably much disappointment among the troops at the disbanding of the corps. However, Captain Stewart was able to obtain the North West Canada Medal and the Rebellion scrip. The scrip entitled any Ranger who applied for it either $80 or of land. As the ultimate ancestor of the SALH, the battle honour , is borne on the guidon of the SALH due to the service of the RMR in this period.http://www.salh.net/history/guidon References *Century of Service: The History of the South Alberta Light Horse by Donald E.

A proponent of the Froebelian method, she focused on kindergarten training schools, playground courses, and a mother's course. She is remembered for Miss Annie Coolidge Rust's Froebel School of Kindergarten Normal Classes. Early years and education Annie Coolidge Rust was born in Richmond, Virginia, one of a family of nine children. Her father, Thomas Adams Rust, a successful hardware merchant in Richmond, was a native of Salem, Massachusetts. The mother, born Phoebe Cutler Chamberlain, was from New Hampshire, but had moved to Boston with her parents when she was a child. She was well educated and very active in church affairs in Boston. The parents agreed that a part of each year should be passed in Boston, the rest of the time being in spent at their Southern home in Richmond. While their children were still young, the family removed to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and, after some of the children were graduated from the Cambridge schools, the family removed to Boston. The mother believed that it would be important for Rust to have a knowledge of the Froebelian principles of education, known as the Kindergarten System. While visiting a friend in Cambridge one day, she learned of a Kindergarten and Normal Class, which Madame Matilda H. Kreige and her daughter, Alma Kreige, from Berlin, had opened in Boston, they having been requested by their teacher, Baroness Bertha von Marenholtz-B√ºlow, to come to the US and introduce this system of education. Rust entered the school as a pupil in one of the first Normal Classes, and after a successful course of study, was graduated in June. Career A summer kindergarten was offered to Rust, which she accepted, she being one of the first pupils of Madame Kreige to teach. In the following autumn, an opportunity to teach a private kindergarten with a large salary was offered her in the West, which she accepted. Access was also given her to the private libraries of the influential people of the city. At the approach of spring, Rust found that the climate did not agree with her, and felt obliged to give up her position and return to Boston. Not long after, a lady came to Boston to secure a teacher for a private school near New York City and Rust was engaged for this position. One of the mothers, a patron, sending three children to the school, was so pleased that she invited Rust to come to live in her home, which she did, and remained through one school year, teaching the older children music on kindergarten principles, at the same time that she was holding her position as teacher of the private school. At the close of this school year, Rust was invited to visit the family at their summer home on the seashore. From there, she was called South by her father and mother, to assist in the disposition of some family property. She remained South through a part of the summer until this was accomplished, the family returning in the autumn to their own house in Boston. A parent who had heard of Rust through Madame Kreige desired that she should open a private kindergarten at Rust's own house, saying she would secure pupils for her from her own friends, which she did. The arrangement pleased Rust as she was able to do more for the children under this arrangement. Subsequently, a lengthy article appeared in the Boston Transcript, written by one of the pupil's mothers relating to Rust's work. As a result, there were many visitors to the kindergarten. An educator from Chicago, after a visit to the school, pronounced the education to be exemplary, and said that he would like to take some of the material as a means of rendering instruction to students in some of the higher levels. The class increased in numbers, until a larger room was needed. Here a Mothers' Class was started; and, as Rust considered herself too much of a novice to assume the responsibility of this class, at her request Elizabeth Peabody took the charge. After one of the patrons of this school removed to Brookline, arrangements were made for an afternoon kindergarten to be established in her home to be run by Rust. This kindergarten was carried on until the city classes had grown to such a size that they required Rust's full attention. Children were received from three years of age, until the age of 12. All the instruction was given upon Froebelian principles. In the meantime, the school had grown to such a size that a house was taken, and Rust associated herself with a kindergarten-trained mother; they together undertaking the establishment of a Kindergarten Normal Class for young ladies. At this time it was deemed advisable to establish a school in a new location out of the city, with larger grounds. A location quite near Boston was decided upon and a kindergarten was soon started by Rust, and after three years' time here again were the different classes above the kindergarten department. It was impossible to secure suitable rooms for the size of the school, and for this reason, for a time, the school was limited to nearly one-half, consequently the patrons decided to build a model building, with the understanding that Rust should hire the building and carry on her school. During the summer, Rust was often consulted as to the best arrangement of the building, and helped in its plans, she coming for this purpose several times from the seashore at Magnolia where she usually passed her summers, having nature-study classes, thus collecting specimens of sea flora, minerals, and so forth, for the fall classes of the new school. But when Rust realized she would be unable to make it the model school she desired, or add to it her Kindergarten Normal Classes, she sought other opportunities. About this time, an urgent appeal came to Rust from a Western city to accept the position of head instructor in a Kindergarten Normal Class, which had been started by the Free Kindergarten Association, and also as instructor in one of the free kindergartens, numbering 100 children, started that autumn, both of which she accepted. She was also very successful with the Normal Class. But the climate of that city, with its strong lake winds, was too severe for Rust, and she was suddenly taken will with pneumonia. Upon her recovery, she was unable to resume her work there, so she returned to Boston After a short rest, she was advised to go to an inland city, and having an opportunity to purchase in Worcester a private school, of children from 3‚Äì12 years of age, she accepted, naming it the Froebel School, at the same time starting a Kindergarten Normal Class, being urged to do this by a member of the Massachusetts Board of Education, as there was no such Training School in Worcester. Her work there was successful, graduating large classes. Rust also gave talks before different clubs in that city and elsewhere. After several years of successful work in Worcester, Rust realized that she was shut off from many things with which she needed to keep in touch in order to grow. She then returned to her former home, Boston, where she would have certain advantages, and here re-established herself in her Kindergarten Normal Classes. Although urged by former pupils, being now parents, to again organize a kindergarten and school for children, she decided to give her time to the instruction of Normal Classes only (at the New Century Building) and to give talks before clubs. Miss Annie Coolidge Rust's Froebel School of Kindergarten Normal Classes Rust's Froebel School of Kindergarten Normal Classes occupied the Pierce Building, Copley Square, Boston. The aim of the school was to prepare young women as kindergarten, primary, and playground teachers, and to give non-professional courses. Supplementary classes were offered in history and principles of education, symbolic education, music, voice training, physical training applied to games; also special lectures by educators, observation and practice teaching, and a short course in Montessori methods. Affiliations Rust was a member of the American Froebel Union; this became the Kindergarten Department of the National Educational Association. She was a member of the Eastern Kindergarten Association, the National Education Association, the International Kindergarten Union, and the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. She was formerly a member of the Worcester Woman's Club, and helped to organize the Women in Council Club, Roxbury, Massachusetts. She belonged to Trinity Church, Boston.

In the South, McGovern was universally viewed as a left-wing extremist because of his support for busing and civil rights, plus his opposition to the Vietnam War, support for granting amnesty to draft dodgersPerry, James Moorhead; Us and Them: How the Press Covered the 1972 Election, p. 136 and support for a $1,000 giveaway to each American as a solution to poverty.Grantham, Dewey W.; The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History, p. 179 Many, especially Republican campaigners, also believed McGovern would legalize abortion and illicit drugs if he were electedDavis, Lanny; Scandal: How \\"Gotcha\\" Politics Is Destroying America, pp. 65-66 ‚Äì despite the fact that his running mate Sargent Shriver was firmly pro-life. In a state that would reflect McGovern's national results, the Democratic nominee did not win a single county in Georgia. Despite overwhelming Democratic dominance of the state for over a century, owing to the Republican leanings of several pro-Union North Georgia counties, chiefly Fannin but also Towns and Pickens, this was the first time any candidate had swept every Georgia county.Thomas, G. Scott; The Pursuit of the White House: A Handbook of Presidential Election Statistics and History, p. 425 Even more unusual, every county in the state would go on to vote for the Democratic candidate, Jimmy Carter, in the next presidential election. The 1972 election constitutes the only time Fulton CountyThe Political Graveyard; Fulton County, Georgia (home of Atlanta) and Hancock CountyThe Political Graveyard; Hancock County, Georgia have not voted Democrat since at least 1880. It is the last time the following counties have ever voted Republican: Calhoun, Clay, Macon, Stewart, Talbot, Taliaferro, and Warren.Sullivan, Robert David; ‚ÄòHow the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century‚Äô; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results Results by county {width=\\"60%\\" class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" County ! colspan=\\"2\\" Richard Milhous Nixon Republican ! colspan=\\"2\\" George Stanley McGovern Democratic ! colspan=\\"2\\" Margin ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Total votes cast -

It was established in 1894. The hospital functions under the aegis of the CNI, Diocese of Chandigarh, with Rev. Joel Mall as the Bishop. The hospital is located on station road about 3.5 km from Cantonment railway station and 3.2 km from Cantonment bus stand. The hospital provides excellent nursing care. It is the oldest hospital and teaching institute of North India . School of Nursing Frances Newton Hospital School of Nursing offers three and a half years of diploma in General Nursing & Midwifery (G.N.M) course along with one and half years of Auxiliary Nursing and Midwifery (ANM) course, at undergraduate level. The institution came into being in 1921. It has the recognition from Indian Nursing Council (INC), Delhi, Government of Punjab and is affiliated to Punjab Nursing Registration Council (PNRC). History The medical missionary work in this sensitive border town was started in the year 1894 by the Presbyterian Church of United States. Rev. Janvier Newton and his wife Mrs. Frances on whom the hospital is named arrived in Firozpur in the year 1877. The same year i.e. 1877 Rev. Janvier had to return to US for health reasons. He took a two years condensed medical course at the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia. Although this was not long enough time to get medical degree, it qualified him to do much for the benefit of the sick. In 1882 when he took charge of the Mission work in Firozpur, he opened a small dispensary in Firozpur City and daily treated a number of patients during summer, while in winter he connected medical work with his preaching. He traveled to the surrounding villages on a camel, back carrying his saddle bags of medicines and equipment. He worked mainly among men. Mrs. Frances, Dr. Newton's wife on whom the hospital is named, was much concerned about the women as there was no medical facility for them. She started running a dispensary for women and children from her residence. Later on, her daughter after taking a short medical course in America joined her. It was the mid 1880s that this dispensary from their home started functioning. When she had gone to US for leave and lying on sick bed in the Women's hospital, Philadelphia, Mrs. Frances Newton thought of building a hospital for the women and children of Firozpur area. She started talking about this and praying about it. The result was $2000/- collected to build the hospital for women and children. That was the beginning of Frances Newton Hospital and a 50-bed hospital was finally opened in 1894, and later on School of Nursing was opened in 1923. The first fully trained Missionary doctor that came out to the Frances Newton Hospital, Firozpur was Dr. Maud Allen from California. She was the Medical Superintendent of the hospital for 30 years. She owned a car which was very very rare thing ‚ÄòModel-T Ford‚Äô. She was an outstanding doctor and liked by all. Dr. Grace Edwards was the next missionary to be the Medical Superintendent for the next six years. She got married and Dr. Dorothy Ferris took charge of the hospital in 1936. Dr. Ferris, a graduate from the University of Cincinnati and a short course at the Columbus College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, before coming to India. She spent a year in Language schools. It was in 1947, the year of India's Independence and the time of partition of Punjab that the men patients most of whom were the victims of the communal violence of those days were also admitted to the hospital. It was then that the hospital became a general hospital for women, children and men. The terrible floods of 1947 razed to ground 36 out of the 39 buildings of the buildings. Dr. Ferris discussed about the floods and the damage to the hospital. She said, ‚ÄúThen of course cae the problem? What are we going to do? Are we going to rebuild or not? The hospital was on the border, the centre of conflict between Pakistan and India. Everybody advised us not to build. It was too dangerous place. Every time there is trouble we would be in middle of it, and so we made it a matter of prayer‚Äù. She continued, ‚ÄúLord, where do you want the hospital? Do you want it or is time to close?‚Äù Dr. Ferris said that the answer came that ‚ÄúI will establish you after your old estates, and I will do better upto you than at the first, and you will know that I am God.‚Äù So on this foundation the new hospital was built. The donations came from the Presbyterian Women's Jubilee Fund. In place of the 85 bed hospital prior to the floods, a 150-bed hospital was built and officially opened in 1953. On the retirement of the last Missionary Medical Superintendent, Dr. Dorothy Ferris and Dr.& Mrs. Bakhshish Masih were contacted in New York and asked to return to India to take over the responsibilities of the hospital from Dr. CY. Satow who had acted as the Medical Superintendent after Dr. Ferris retired. In 1986 Dr. Bakhshish Masih left and went to the States. The responsibility of running Frances Newton Hospital was handed over to Dr. Richard David who was working as Deputy Medical Superintendent and joined with his wife Dr.(Mrs.) Reena David in September 1976. Dr. Richard David worked in Frances Newton Hospital as a Director/Medical Superintendent till 31 July 2014. Dr. Anurag Amin has been appointed as Director Medical Superintendent on 1 August 2014.

Robert Leo \\"Bob\\" Hulseman (April 5, 1932 ‚Äì December 21, 2016) was an American businessman and entrepreneur who was best known as the inventor of the red solo cup, which is produced by his family's company, Solo Cup Company. He also co-designed the Traveler Lid, which prevents foam from hot beverages such as lattes and cappuccinos from touching the drinker's nose, now widely used by Starbucks and other brands. Hulseman joined the staff of The Solo Cup Company, which had been founded in 1936 by his father Leo Hulseman, when he was 18 years old. Hulseman spent more than 60 years at the Solo Cup Company, including as the company's President and CEO from 1980 until 2006. Hulseman developed and introduced the red solo cup, which crucial product of the Solo Cup Company and a part of everyday life for many Americans. The cup became an icon of college and tailgate parties and an essential element in popular drinking games, including beer pong. The red cup was further popularized by Toby Keith's 2011 hit single, \\"Red Solo Cup\\". Biography Early and personal life Hulseman was born in Chicago, Illinois, on April 5, 1932. His mother, Dorothy (n√©e Hall), was a singer known by the stage name Dora Hall, while his father, Leo Hulseman, established the Solo Cup Company, a manufacturer of disposable cups, bowls and plates, in 1936. Robert Hulseman survived polio as a teenager, which left one of his legs shorter than the other, which was surgically corrected, and affected the left side of his body. He met his wife, Sheila, with whom he had ten children, while both were students at Marquette University. He also briefly served in the United States Army. Career His father, Leo Hulseman, a former Dixie Cup employee, had founded the Solo Cup Company in 1936. Robert Hulseman joined his father's company as a factory worker when he was 18-years old and worked his way through a series of jobs. Hulseman later developed the Solo Cup Company's plastic business, which would lead to the development of the plastic red solo cup during the 1970s. Robert Hulseman created the solo cup during the mid-1970s and utilized his own children and family as a focus group. Hulseman would place small plastic cups of varying colors on his kitchen table for his kids to peruse, including blue, red, peach and yellow. While the peach cups were not a hit, the red solo cups proved popular with both his children and consumers. Hulseman, himself, favored blue solo cups. Husleman initially launched the red solo cups in smaller 5, 7 and 9 ounce sizes. However, he eventually introduced the iconic 16 ounce red solo cup, which proved to be the most popular size long term. When the 16 ounce red cups were first sold, very few consumers drank beers that size. However, consumer tastes changed to match the size of the popular plastic cups. Today, the plastic solo cups are manufactured in dozens of colors, but the red solo cups remain the company's best seller. Hulseman became President of the Solo Cup Company, which he inherited from his father, in 1980, succeeding his father. He later became the company's CEO as well. In 1986, Hulseman and his employee, Jack Clements, developed the Traveler Lid for use on coffee cups and other hot beverage containers.

Wenzel Parler (, 1404) was an architect and sculptor from the Parler family of German-Bohemian master builders and son of Peter Parler. He worked on Gothic churches in the Holy Roman cities of Prague, N√∂rdlingen, and Vienna during the Late Middle Ages.  Life  The first work of Wenzel Parler can be found in the second half of the 1370s in Prague, where he was instrumental in the construction of St. Vitus Cathedral until at least 1392. His brother Johann Parler the younger took over construction of the cathedral in 1398, and they in turn were succeeded by a certain Master Petrik. Under these three masters, the transept and the great tower were finished, as was the gable which connects the tower with the southern transept. Nicknamed Golden Gate, it became the portal through which kings of Bohemia entered the cathedral for coronation ceremonies.Bork, Robert Odell (2011): The Geometry of Creation: Architectural Drawing and the Dynamics of Gothic Design. Farnham, UK: Ashgate Publishing. pp254-256. He left Prague in 1398 and his younger brother Johann Parler the younger took over construction of the cathedral. Although not clearly documented, Wenzel probably went on to oversee construction of St. Salvator's Church () in N√∂rdlingen, a free imperial city in the Holy Roman Empire. From 1400, he surfaced as a stonemason at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, where he became (Master Builder of the Cathedral) from 1403. The original architectural idea for the southern tower was probably developed by Wenzel.Missong, Alfred (1970). Heiliges Wien. 3rd Edition. Wien: Wiener Dom-Verlag. p 22. The Italian Envoy there wanted to recruit him to Milan to oversee the building of Milan Cathedral, but Parler died in 1404 before he could take on the project. Wenzel Parler's identity as the cathedral architect in Vienna is not fully confirmed. Wenceslas was a common name in Bohemia and southern Germany at that time, and Parler derives from Parlier, which means \\"foreman\\" or \\"construction manager.\\" However, the fame of his family along with the timing and significant stylistic parallels between St. Vitus Cathedral and St. Stephen's Cathedral make the common identity likely.

Dante and Virgil are each shown 6 times, descending through the 10 chasms of the circle via a ridge. One of only 4 fully coloured pages. The Divine Comedy Illustrated by Botticelli is a manuscript of the Divine Comedy by Dante, illustrated by 92 full-page pictures by Sandro Botticelli that are considered masterpieces and amongst the best works of the Renaissance painter. The images are mostly not taken beyond silverpoint drawings, many worked over in ink, but four pages are fully coloured. The manuscript eventually disappeared and most of it was rediscovered in the late nineteenth century, having been detected in the collection of the Duke of Hamilton by Gustav Friedrich Waagen, with a few other pages being found in the Vatican Library. Botticelli had earlier produced drawings, now lost, to be turned into engravings for a printed edition, although only the first nineteen of the hundred cantos were illustrated. In 1882 the main part of the manuscript was added to the collection of the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin (Museum of Prints and Drawings) when the director Friedrich Lippmann bought 85 of Botticelli's drawings. Lippmann had moved swiftly and quietly, and when the sale was announced there was a considerable outcry in the British press and Parliament.Havely, R. N., Dante's British Public: Readers and Texts, from the Fourteenth Century to the Present, pp. 244‚Äì259, 2014, Oxford University Press, , 9780199212446, google books Soon after that, it was revealed that another eight drawings from the same manuscript were in the Vatican Library. The bound drawings had been in the collection of Queen Christina of Sweden and after her death in Rome in 1689, had been bought by Pope Alexander VIII for the Vatican collection. The time of separation of these drawings is unknown. The Map of Hell is in the Vatican collection. The exact arrangement of text and illustrations is not known, but a vertical arrangement ‚Äî placing the illustration page on top of the text page ‚Äî is proposed by Barbara Watts as a more efficient way of combining the text-illustration pairs. A volume designed to open vertically would be approximately 47 cm wide by 64 cm high, and would incorporate both the text and the illustration for each canto on a single page. The Berlin drawings and those in the Vatican collection were assembled together, for the first time in centuries, in an exhibition showing all 92 of them in Berlin, Rome, and London's Royal Academy, in 2000-01. The 1481 printed edition Engraving by Baldini after Botticelli, from the 1481 book The drawings in the manuscript were not the first to be created by Botticelli for the Divine Comedy. He also illustrated another Commedia, this time a printed edition with engravings as illustrations, that was published by Nicholo di Lorenzo della Magna in Florence in 1481, and is mentioned by Vasari. Scholars agree that the engravings by Baccio Baldini follow drawn designs by Botticelli, though unfortunately Baldini was unable to render Botticelli's style very effectively.Lightbown, pp. 86-89 Botticelli's attempt to design the illustrations for a printed book was unprecedented for a leading painter, and though it seems to have been something of a flop, this was a role for artists that had an important future.Landau, 35, 38 Vasari wrote disapprovingly of the edition: \\"being of a sophistical turn of mind, he there wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante and illustrated the Inferno which he printed, spending much time over it, and this abstention from work led to serious disorders in his living.\\"Vasari, 152 Vasari, who lived when printmaking had become far more important than in Botticelli's day, never takes it seriously, perhaps because his own paintings did not sell well in reproduction. The Divine Comedy consists of 100 cantos, and the printed text left space for one engraving for each canto. However, only 19 illustrations were engraved, and most copies of the book have only the first two or three. The first two, and sometimes three, are usually printed on the book page, while the later ones are printed on separate sheets that are pasted into place. This suggests that the production of the engravings lagged behind the printing, and the later illustrations were pasted into the stock of printed and bound books, and perhaps sold to those who had already bought the book. Unfortunately Baldini was neither very experienced nor talented as an engraver, and was unable to express the delicacy of Botticelli's style in his plates.Lightbown, 89; Landau, 108; Dempsey The project may have been disrupted by Botticelli's summons to Rome to take part in the project to fresco the Sistine Chapel. He was perhaps away from July 1481 to at the latest May 1482.Lightbown, 90, 94  Conception and progress of the manuscript Lucifer's second drawing by Botticelli from Inferno XXXIV. Lucifer's picture spans two pages, and lies outside the text- illustration structure, unifying the narrative of the series. It also illustrates the full story of Inferno canto XXXIV and shows Lucifer's geographical position in Hell. It is often thought that Botticelli's drawings were commissioned by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, an important patron of the artist. The early 16th-century writer known as the Anonimo Magliabecchiano says that Botticelli painted a Dante on parchment for Lorenzo, but makes it sound as if this was a completed work. Alternatively the drawings we have may have been a different set for Botticelli's own use and pleasure, which is the conclusion of Ronald Lightbown.Lightbown, 282 Although the printed and illustrated book was rapidly replacing the traditional and very expensive illuminated manuscript in the last decades of the 15th century, the grandest bibliophiles were still commissioning manuscripts,Ettlingers, 178-179 and continued to do so well into the next century, from artists such as Giulio Clovio (1498‚Äì1578), perhaps the last major artist to be mainly a manuscript illuminator. The drawings illustrate a manuscript of Dante's Divine Comedy. The entire thematic sequence of each canto was supposed to be illustrated by its own full-page drawing by Botticelli, an unprecedentedly ambitious conception. Normally, by the 15th century, a single incident was shown in each framed illustration in illustrated Dantes, as for other narrative works. Botticelli was combining this tradition with another, continuous narrative, where recurrent incidents were shown, usually unframed and in the margin below the text. Thus the principal figures of Dante, Virgil and Beatrice often appear several times in an image.Ettlingers, 178-179; Lightbown, 294 There are two additional drawings, a map of Hell preceding Inferno, and a double-page drawing of Lucifer that depicts Dante's and Virgil's descent to Hell. The text is written on the reverse of the drawings, so that it was on the same page as the next drawing. As was usual, the text was completed before the illustrations were begun, omitting the major capital letters which were to be illuminated. The exact date of creation of the drawings is unknown but it is agreed that they were produced over a period of several years, and a stylistic development has been detected.Lightbown, 282, 290 Estimates vary between a start around the mid-1480s with the last approximately a decade later, and a period extending between about 1480 and 1505 (by which time Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco was dead).Lightbown, 282-290, 295 Botticelli never completed the task. Many of the images are not fully drawn and illumination is completed for only four of them. However, the drawings are of such artistry and beauty, that they have been described as \\"central to Botticelli's artistic achievement\\" and no less important than the Primavera. They represent by far the bulk of surviving drawings by Botticelli. Of the small number of other sheets surviving, none relate directly to surviving paintings.Lightbown, 296 Botticelli is thought to have started the drawings at least roughly following the text sequence. The drawing for Canto I of Inferno has the figures at a larger scale than that used in later cantos, up to the end of the Purgatorio. The earlier drawings for the Inferno are generally the most completed, and the most detailed,Lightbown, 290 but cantos II to VII, XI and XIV are missing, though probably made by Botticelli. We have the text pages for the last cantos, Paradiso, XXXI to XXXIII, but the drawings were never begun.Lightbown, 280 The differing degrees of completion, and the canto numbers and first lines of the matching text inscribed on some sequences of pages but not others, all complicate understanding Botticelli's progress, and have been extensively debated.Lightbown, 280-296 Technique Paradise, Canto XXX. The vegetation and small figures to the left of the path have been inked over; on the right only the silverpoint stage has been done. Each page was first drawn with a metal stylus, leaving lines that are now very faint. There are numerous changes evident, which are easy to make in this technique. The next stage was to go over these lines with a pen and black or brown ink. Most of the pages were not taken beyond these stages, which are often found together on a page, with only some areas inked over. Other pages have not yet been inked at all. Only four pages fully received the final stage of colouring in tempera, though others are part-coloured, usually just the main figures. It has been argued that Botticelli, or his patron, came to prefer the uncoloured drawings, and deliberately left the rest, but this is not accepted by most scholars.Lightbown, 282; Ettlingers, 179  Structure and innovations The illustration for canto XV is part of the third round of Inferno, depicting the punishment of those who acted violently against God, nature, and art. Botticelli's manuscripts incorporate several innovations in the way text and images are presented in the volume. In other similar illustrated manuscripts of Dante's Inferno, multiple illustrations were used to depict the events described in a canto. In addition, most of the space in a page was given to the illustration and associated commentary while the text portion was smaller in comparison. Therefore, a single canto spread over multiple pages. Botticelli's text and illustration arrangement innovates by presenting the text on a single page in four vertical columns. In addition, unlike similar works, Botticelli's manuscript uses but a single illustration per canto, which occupied a whole page, presenting a unified depiction of the sequence of events of a canto in a vertical format. This way, the readers know that when they advance to a new page, they enter the thematic sequence of a new canto. The text of each canto, from left to right, matches, to a high degree, the pictorial representation as the reader views the illustration from the upper left corner and then proceeds downwards. This reflects the vertical structure of the descent of the two poets through the nine circles of Hell. The additional two illustrations of the Map of Hell and Lucifer lie outside this canto-text structure, thus providing an element of continuity which unifies the work. Lucifer's second drawing by Botticelli from Inferno XXXIV spans across two pages, and lies outside the text-illustration structure, unifying the narrative of the series. It also illustrates the full story of Inferno canto XXXIV and shows Lucifer's geographical position in Hell. Botticelli renders vertically the ground planes of the illustrations of the second and third rounds of Inferno. Although the illustrations for the first three rounds depict different imagery, the vertical perspective links them into a single unit. The third round consists of the illustrations for cantos XV, XVI and XVII, which depict the punishment of those who sinned by violence against God, nature and art. Botticelli uses thirteen drawings to illustrate the eighth circle of Hell, depicting ten chasms that Dante and Virgil descend through a ridge.  Dimensions Inferno X, with just Dante (in red) and Virgil (in blue) coloured. Each page of the manuscript was approximately 32 cm high by 47 cm wide. Since the text of each canto was written on a single page and the accompanying illustration was on a separate page, arranging the two pages in a horizontal format would have been impractical as it would be approximately wide. This would entail the readers turning their heads from left to right while trying to connect the text columns on the left to the illustration on the right. A vertical arrangement, stacking the illustration page on top of the text page, is a more efficient way of combining the text-illustration pair; a volume designed to open vertically is a more probable scenario for Botticelli's manuscript. If the manuscript's binding were to open vertically, the dimensions would be approximately wide by high, and would incorporate both the text and the illustration on a single page. This would have made reading the text and looking at the drawing of each canto easier and more efficient.  Content location  The Vatican Library has the drawing of the Map Of Hell, and the illustrations for cantos I, IX, X, XII, XIII, XV and XVI of the Inferno. The Map of Hell and the drawing for canto I are drawn on each side of the same goat-skin parchment. The drawings that were in the Berlin museum were separated post-war after the division of Germany, but the collection was re- integrated following reunification. The Berlin Museum houses the rest of the extant illustrations, including the drawing for canto VIII. The sequence of the Inferno drawings for cantos XVII to canto XXX for Paradiso is without gaps. The page for the drawing of canto XXXI appears blank, and the sequence ends with the unfinished drawing for canto XXXII.  Film  The film Botticelli Inferno is based on the history of the illustrated manuscript. Notes References *Dempsey, Charles, \\"Botticelli, Sandro\\", Grove Art Online, Oxford Art Online.

The human-authored processes of chemical engineering are accordingly represented as biomimicry of the natural phenomena above, and the entire class of non-photosynthetic chains by which complex molecules are constructed is described as chemo-. Chemosynthesis can be applied in many different areas of research, including in positional assembly of molecules. This is where molecules are assembled in certain positions in order to perform specific types of chemosynthesis using molecular building blocks. In this case synthesis is most efficiently performed through the use of molecular building blocks with a small amount of linkages. Unstrained molecules are also preferred, which is when molecules undergo minimal external stress, which leads to the molecule having a low internal energy. There are two main types of synthesis: additive and subtractive. In additive synthesis the structure starts with nothing, and then gradually molecular building blocks are added until the structure that is needed is created. In subtractive synthesis they start with a large molecule and remove building blocks one by one until the structure is achieved. This form of engineering is then contrasted with mechanosynthesis, a hypothetical process where individual molecules are mechanically manipulated to control reactions to human specification. Since photosynthesis and other natural processes create extremely complex molecules to the specifications contained in RNA and stored long-term in DNA form, advocates of molecular engineering claim that an artificial process can likewise exploit a chain of long-term storage, short-term storage, enzyme-like copying mechanisms similar to those in the cell, and ultimately produce complex molecules which need not be proteins. For instance, sheet diamond or carbon nanotubes could be produced by a chain of non-biological reactions that have been designed using the basic model of biology. Use of the term chemosynthesis reinforces the view that this is feasible by pointing out that several alternate means of creating complex proteins, mineral shells of mollusks and crustaceans, etc., evolved naturally, not all of them dependent on photosynthesis and a food chain from the sun via chlorophyll. Since more than one such pathway exists to creating complex molecules, even extremely specific ones such as proteins edible to fish, the likelihood of humans being able to design an entirely new one is considered (by these advocates) to be near certainty in the long run, and possible within a generation.  Modern Applications  Cellulose Nanoparticles that can be synthesized through Chemosynthetic methods. Several methods of nanoscale chemosynthesis have been developed, a common variant of which is chemical bath deposition (CBD). This process enables large-scale synthesis of thin film layers of a variety of materials, and has been especially useful in providing such films for opto-electronics through the efficient creation of lead sulfide (PbS) films. CBD synthesis of these films allows for both cost-effective and accurate assemblies, with grain type and size as well as optical properties of the nanomaterial dictated by the properties of the surrounding bath. As such, this method of nanoscale chemosynthesis is often implemented when these properties are desired, and can be used for a wide range of nanomaterials, not just lead sulfide, due to the adjustable properties. As explained previously, the usage of chemical bath deposition allows for the synthesis of large deposits of nanofilm layers at a low cost, which is important in the mass production of cadmium sulfide. The low cost associated with the synthesis of CdS through means of chemical deposition has seen CdS nanoparticles being applied to semiconductor sensitized solar cells, which when treated with CdS nanoparticles, see improved performance in their semiconductor materials through a reduction of the band gap energy.Vanalakar, S.A. \\"Quantum Size Effects in Chemosynthesized Nanostructured CdS Thin Films.\\" Digest Journal of Nanomaterials and Biostructures. The usage of chemical deposition in particular allows for the crystallite orientation of CdS to be more favourable, though the process is quite time consuming. Research by S.A. Vanalakar in 2010 resulted in the successful production of cadmium sulfide nanoparticle film with a thickness of 139 nm, though this was only after the applied films were allowed to undergo deposition for 300 minutes. As the deposition time was increased for the film, not only was the film thickness found to increase, but the band gap of the resultant film decreased.

Racing history The MARC Focus GTC which won the Invitational class at the 2014 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour. The MARC Mazda3 GTC which won the Invitational class at the 2016 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour. Production Founder Ryan McLeod entered several editions of the Bathurst 12 Hour under the team's former name, Racer Industries. After an initial foray in 2009 with father Peter and brother Gerard, the family entry, driving a Holden Astra SRi returned in 2010 to win its class. In the years following, the team moved away from a family focus, instead providing opportunities to various young drivers including Chaz Mostert, Scott Pye and Ashley Walsh in a HSV VXR Turbo. The team won further class victories in 2012, in which the team finished seventh overall, and in 2013. GTC In 2013, an initial GTC prototype was built and tested by Pace Innovations, following their work on new chassis for the Supercars Championship and V8SuperTourer series. The initial model, styled as a Ford Focus, featured a five-litre Ford Coyote V8 engine and was tested at Queensland Raceway by Glenn Seton and Russell Ingall amongst others. After an initial plan to run the cars in South Africa, Racer Industries developed a package based on the GTC prototype and entered three cars, now each branded as a MARC, in the Invitational class of the 2014 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour. McLeod used the event as a launching pad for developing and promoting a package that could compete in global endurance races on a reduced budget. The team, or its cars, have since competed in the Silverstone 24 Hours, Dubai 24 Hour and Sepang 12 Hours amongst others. In 2015, the team competed in the full season of the 24H Series, consisting of six 12 or 24 hour races globally. Since then, VDS Racing Adventures have used MARC cars in the series. In 2015, MARC also unveiled a Mazda3-styled body panel kit to enter the 2015 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour, which still used the Ford Coyote engine. In 2014, MARC Cars were given their own class in the National Sports Sedan Series, while they are also eligible for the Australian GT Trophy Series as of 2016. With the Invitational class at the Bathurst 12 Hour predominantly made up of MARC entries, the team has won four consecutive class victories with the GTC prototypes, which extends to six when taking into account their HSV victories. In 2017, MARC Cars competed in the United States for the first time, with entries in the California 8 Hours at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca and the 24H COTA at the Circuit of the Americas. II V8 The MARC II V8 which won the Invitational class at the 2018 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour. Ahead of the 2018 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour, MARC Cars Australia launched the MARC II V8, their second generation GTC racer unofficially styled on the Ford Mustang. Their three entries in the Bathurst 12 Hour were allowed to lap in the 2:06s bracket, having previously been restricted to 2:10s. With MARC Cars making up seven of the nine entries in the Invitational class, the manufacturer picked up another class victory, with the sole remaining MARC II V8 finishing ahead of the first generation MARC entries. GT3 and GT4 In 2016, MARC Cars acquired a BMW M6 GT3 and entered it in selected rounds of the 2016 Australian GT Championship, including hiring factory BMW driver Bruno Spengler to drive with regular driver Morgan Haber at the Phillip Island round. The team also entered their M6 GT3, as well as a record six GTC entries, at the 2017 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour with Chaz Mostert as lead driver. Mostert qualified second on the grid, however the car did not finish the race after suffering a Gearbox failure. From the 2018 Bathurst 12 Hour, MARC Cars prepared a BMW M4 GT4 for American entry RHC-Lawrence/Strom.

Thoughts of Ionesco was a Detroit-based post-hardcore band extant from 1996-1999 and known for detuned guitars, screamed vocals, complex arrangements, improvisational sections inspired by free jazz, and their destructive live performances. Background Formed in 1996, the band was briefly a five-piece named Building featuring members of the melodic hardcore band Empathy in addition to founding members Sean Madigan Hoen, Brian Repa, and Nathan Miller. After reducing the line-up to a three- piece, they recorded a demo and played a house show in Ypsilanti, MI under the name Triptych; the show was stopped by local police after the band finished their first song. Their demo tape displayed influences of My War-era Black Flag mixed with then contemporary hardcore groups like Deadguy and Universal Order of Armageddon; the band's sound was further complicated by the metal- influenced double-bass drumming by Repa. Prior to an early show opening for Washington D.C.'s Damnation A.D., the band renamed themselves Thoughts of Ionesco (referencing the absurdist playwright Eugene Ionesce), a decision motivated by their desire for an additional guitarist and what they perceived as constraint in a moniker signifying a set of three. The band, however, would never find an appropriate second guitar-player. Thoughts of Ionesco in Pontiac, MI. 1999. Two songs culled from their Triptych demo tape were released as a 7\\" on the band's own record label, Cascade Records, in late 1996. Hoen and Repa were in high school at the time, limiting their performances to weekend excursions around the Midwest. In December 1996, they recorded what would become their album ...And Then There Was Motion. In early 1997, Michigan hardcore label Conquer the World Records offered to release their latest recording, but the band offered instead a remixed version of their demo tape, which was released as The Triptych Session. The album was well received in hardcore fanzines. Thoughts of Ionesco toured North America in the summer of 1997, frequently with their friends Wallside. Their second album, ...And Then There Was Motion, was released later in 1997 by Kalamazoo Michigan label Makoto Records. The recording revealed a heavier sound and more complex arrangements and was described by Alternative Press Magazine as \\"an ultimate realization of pain-through-sound.\\" Throughout 1997 TOI performed shows with North American hardcore bands Converge, Coalesce, Dropdead, His Hero is Gone, Botch, as well as numerous punk and hardcore festivals. A split 7\\" with Detroit band Cromwell was released later that year. In early 1998, original drummer Brian Repa left the band for the first time and was replaced by Derek Grant of the Suicide Machines (and later Alkaline Trio). With Grant, the band began exploring noise sections, extended improvisation and epic song structures inspired by Mahavishnu Orchestra and electric-period Miles Davis while simultaneously seeking an even heavier sound in the vein of Swans and Godflesh. The band recorded its third LP, A Skin Historic, with Grant in summer of 1998. It was slated to be released by the well-distributed Alley Sweeper Records and received advanced reviews, yet the label folded. Grant left the band and was replaced by Brett Fratangelo. The album was soon released on Makoto Recordings. At this time the band added a live saxophonist and, disillusioned with the hardcore scene, began opening for extreme metal bands like Brutal Truth and Nile. In February 1999 Thoughts of Ionesco contributed two exclusive songs to Utilitarian Records' Various Artists compilation The Collateral Compilation. In May 1999, Thoughts of Ionesco toured the United States and Canada with Small Brown Bike and Dead Season. Amid personal turmoil and differences with Fratangelo, the band cancelled both a U.S. and European tour that summer. Drummer Brian Repa returned for the band's final recording, For Detroit, From Addiction, which was tracked days after their final show in Ann Arbor Michigan on November 20, 1999. The album was released two year later by At Arms Mechanics. In 2006, Chicago label Seventh Rule released an anthology CD, The Scar is Our Watermark, featuring selected, remastered songs from each of the band's releases. In 2014, Alternative Press listed Thoughts of Ionesco in their article \\"Twenty '90s Bands that Need to Reunite Already.\\" Also in 2014, Hoen, now a writer, published a memoir Songs Only You Know, in which he recounted a troubled young adulthood and family life. The book features several scenes in which he performs and travels as part of Thoughts of Ionesco. The book was a Barnes and Noble Discovery Selection, a Michigan Notable Book, and was named a top-ten book of 2014 by Rolling Stone.. In 2017 TOI reunited with drummer Derek Grant to record a three-song EP, Skar Cymbals, and on June 24th played their first show in nearly eighteen years at the Magic Stick in Detroit, Michigan. Longtime friend and fan Jeff Tuttle (formerly of Dillinger Escape Plan) joined the band as second guitarist. Skar Cymbals was released to underground acclaim, although plans for future performances and releases were not announced.

The film was released theatrically in the United States on January 6, 2017. Plot As good at math as he is terrible with girls, Ryan Chess (Troy Doherty) has spent an entire summer pining away for his pretty and vivacious co-worker, Carly Alvarez (Flavia Watson). Just as the summer is coming to a close and he has worked up the courage to ask her out, he is shocked to learn the store is closing at the end of the day. And Carly is going to move away. Far away. With a full ride to MIT only a few months away, he knows he is nuts to care. But he does. And so he hatches a crazy plan to save the store by the end of the day and thereby make Carly fall in love with him, with the help of his best friend Jeremy (Zedrick Restauro), and his co- workers Ellen (Raychel Diane Weiner), and Gary (Ross Mackenzie). An uphill battle that gets even more difficult when the handsome and possibly sinister regional manager, Brady (Alex Ashbaugh), arrives. Brady says he is there to roll up his sleeves and pitch in with the sale, but Ryan suspects ulterior motives. And when he discovers that Carly and Brady were once romantically involved, he really loses his composure and chances of saving the store. Ultimately, Ryan relies on his big brain to save the store and out Brady as the villain he is. It is here that his confidence shines and Carly sees him for who he really is and falls in love with him.

He has described the budget as \\"less than 90% of the commercials [he] made before this movie,\\" and revealed the budget of the film, from start to finish, was less than $200,000. Significant changes to the script were made weeks before production started due to location changes, and due to recasting of the Jane Chess character. The film's setting of Cy's Auto Sound & Stereo was meant to be similar to Fry's Electronics or Best Buy, but due to budget constraints, Grossman instead rewrote it as a small mom and pop type store, shot on location at Al and Ed's Car Stereo, a small southern California chain of car-centric stores. Director of Photography Seamus Tierney shot the film on a Red Epic, in 4K. Release Film Festivals The film premiered, and began its festivals run, at the 2016 Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival, where it won the awards Best Director for Grossman, Best Supporting Actress for Raychel Diane Weiner, and Best Cinematography for Seamus Tierney. At South By Southwest 2016 Film Festival, the film was nominated for Excellence in Title Design under Title Designer Karin Fong, and Title Editor Caleb Woods. Other 2016 festivals it was an official selection for include the Beverly Hills Film Festival, Cinema At The Edge Film Festival, South Bay Film & Music Festival, and the LA Indie Film Festival. Theatrical & Digital Releases The film was released for a limited theatrical run in Los Angeles, starting January 6, 2017, exclusively at Arena Cinelounge in Hollywood.

This trend has been associated with nostalgia for the 1980s musical scene, and a dislike for current musical trends. One of the pioneers of this genre is Canadian producer and YouTuber Tronicbox. Others who have made songs in this genre include Saint-Laurent, Callum Warrender, Jerry Galeries, and Nick*. Part of this trend is to also simulate the 1980s style of album covers and VHS-quality video. Thump, the music section for Vice, described this genre as a \\"niche\\"; Tronicbox wrote in late 2017: \\"Starting to see so many \\"80's Remix\\" popping up on the internet these days\\". Concept photo-manipulated Justin Bieber from the 80s remix of What Do You Mean? One of the earliest attempts at an '80s remix was a remix of the Game of Thrones Theme by Russian musician Steve Duzz in 2014. Duzz's remix was later incorporated with a '80s-era VHS intro of the same series. According to The A.V. Club, the general premise of this musical genre involves the hypothetical question of how modern day pop stars would have sounded if they had dominated the industry in the 1980s instead of the 2010s; the site described the results as \\"surprisingly listenable\\" despite the contradiction of present-day lyrics and 1980s production values. The site mentions that the songs take music back to the \\"sweet, shallow, and gloriously artificial\\" time of the 1980s. To achieve the effect, the 1980s remix artists take the original song and \\"slather it with obsolete-sounding synthesizer music.\\" They use various images of '80s music such as saxophone solos, syncopated synthesiser beats, and a more liberal use of chord progressions than the originals. Some song adaptions seek inspiration from specific 1980s songs. An example is \\"Sugar\\" by Maroon 5 reworked with a backing track very reminiscent of \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" by Rick Astley. The comments section of 1980s remix songs usually include fake obituaries of fallen '80s stars who are either dead or obscure in the present-day era. They also include references to high school proms, weddings, and other life events from the '80s where the commentators supposedly had the song in their life (essentially parodying the comments frequently seen in the comment sections of '80s hits). Critical reception Yahoo.com described Tronicbox's remix of \\"Into You\\" as a \\"dreamy and slinky '80s midtempo bop\\". ABC thought \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" was a \\"pitch-perfect '80s makeover, complete with wailing guitars\\". NME described \\"What Do You Mean It‚Äôs 1985\\" as having \\"motive synths and echo-y vocals over a pinky-plonky piano riff and a drum machine being spanked oh so tenderly, before one hell of a sax solo.\\" The site thought \\"Love Yourself\\" (Purpose 1985) was an upbeat and sassy rework of Bieber's original song, while describing \\"One Last Time\\" as an \\"early Madonna-esque disco banger\\". NZ Herald thought the \\"clever reworking\\" of Justin Bieber songs could have been at home in the soundtracks to 1980s classics like The Breakfast Club or Sixteen Candles, while suggesting \\"One Last Time\\" would have offered serious competition to Madonna's chart reign. Mashable thought the remix of \\"Firework\\" was flawless, while The Huffington Post thought the Bieber arrangements were \\"pure genius\\" and sounded breathy. News Cult thought the Bieber songs would have perfectly suited Saved by the Bell. FACT magazine said \\"What Do You Mean\\" had a \\"reverb heavy drums and a ripping sax solo\\". Capital FM said that Saint-Laurent transformed \\"This Is What You Came For\\" through \\"technical wizardry\\" through synth and guitar. PopCrush thought \\"One Last Time\\" paid homage to Madonna, Vanessa Williams, and Whitney Houston while sounding like an aerobic song. SpinOrBinMusic deemed Tronicbox's work as \\"strangely amazing\\", while E! News deemed them masterpieces. Like Totally 80s took his work less seriously, describing it as funny and hilarious, while recommending it as the \\"perfect prank\\" for kids who were oversinging the 21st century songs. Digital Spy said Tronicbox reworked the songs into \\"gloriously retro anthems\\". MensXP described Jerry Galeries' reworking of Linkin Park's Numb as having a \\"peppy...retro-disco-vibe\\" that would have topped the 80's charts. Thump called \\"Closer\\" as more than a gimmick, and instead something \\"strange and sultry\\". This Is What You Came For works \\"weirdly well\\" according to Elle magazine.

It tells the story of Violet Paige, a controversial, bisexual celebutante in Gotham City who was tortured and cybernetically-enhanced by a secret organisation in her youth, becoming the vigilante Mother Panic to get revenge. The series features guest appearances by Batman and his allies, and was the only Young Animal launch title to feature an original character at its time. Publication history Creation Young Animal is an imprint of DC Comics, designed to tell stories set within the DC Universe aimed specifically at mature readers. Mother Panic was the final of the imprint's four launch titles to release. The series and its title character, Violet Paige, was conceived by Young Animal curator Gerard Way and illustrator Tommy Lee Edwards, both of whom conceptualized the character's background. Jody Houser, the author of Valiant Comics' Faith, was asked by Young Animal editor Molly Mahan to write several sample pages featuring Mother Panic to see if she \\"could nail [her] voice\\". Houser, who had grown up reading Batman, was hired shortly after turning in her work and began to write the series. She expanded upon Way's and Edwards' concept to \\"flesh out\\" the main character and establish her within Gotham City and the Batman mythos. Unlike the other Young Animal titles, which feature established DC characters such as the Doom Patrol, Mother Panic features an original character created for the series. Houser's vision of Paige was essentially that of an anti-Batman: unlike Batman, Paige's identity as a vigilante is \\"not entirely an act\\" and the character as a whole is \\"messed up\\". Houser hoped that the series would last for several years and that Paige will continue to evolve. She also wanted to explore aspects of Gotham not seen in other Batman-related comics, due to the mature themes of Mother Panic; for this reason, she excluded well-known adversaries such as the Penguin and Catwoman. The first several issues were illustrated by Edwards, followed by Shawn Crystal and John Paul Leon. Jim Krueger writes a backup story called \\"Gotham Radio\\" for the series. Print run The first issue of Mother Panic was published on November 9, 2016, cover-dated January 2017. The issue's story established Violet Paige and the series' setting in Gotham City, and featured a cameo by Batman. All Young Animal titles (except Doom Patrol) were placed on hiatus after 12 issues. https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/12/gerard- ways-young-animal-relaunches-its-core-comic.html In early 2018, DC published the five-issue crossover story Milk Wars featuring both Young Animal characters (including Mother Panic) and more traditional DC Universe characters including the Justice League.https://www.dccomics.com/graphic- novels/milk-wars-2018/dcyoung-animal-milk-wars Mother Panic was relaunched in May 2018 with a new first issue and given the subtitle Gotham A.D. Unlike the first series, the second volume is set in a dystopian future where masked vigilantes are outlawed, Batman having abandoned Gotham.https://io9.gizmodo.com/dcs-young-animal-imprint-is-getting-a-cosmic- reshuffle-1821300634 Gotham A.D. ended after six issues in August 2018. Reception The original Mother Panic series has been generally well- received. On the review aggregator ComicBookRoundUp, it holds an average rating on 7.8/10, based on 135 reviews. Reviewing the first issue for IGN, Jesse Schedeen called it the standout of the Young Animal lineup. He wrote that although it was set within Gotham City, Mother Panic felt distinctive from the Batman family and surreal. Gotham A.D. was also well-received.

Early life and education Murnain was born in Newcastle, to parents Anne and Neil, and grew up in Narrabri in north western New South Wales. Murnain attended Narrabri Public School and Narrabri High School. Her mother, Anne Murnain, contested the federal seat of Gwydir for the Australian Labor Party in 1998 and 2001. Murnain joined the Labor party herself when she was old enough, in 2000, and attended her first party conference at 15 years of age. She campaigned for Australia to become a republic. Murnain moved to Sydney to attend the University of New South Wales to complete a Bachelor of Social Science. Murnain worked three jobs while studying. She is currently undertaking a Masters of Business Administration at the Australian Graduate School of Management (UNSW). Murnain is married to Tom Hollywood, an Army Reservist and Labor staffer who has worked for NSW Labor MLC Sophie Cotsis. Career Murnain worked as an electorate officer for Michael Daley MP from 2005‚Äì2007. She served as a policy advisor for Ageing and Disability Services to Kristina Keneally MP from 2007‚Äì2008. In 2008 Murnain began working at the NSW Labor Party head office as an organiser running campaigns in local, state and federal by-elections and general elections. With the support of the Australian Political Exchange Council, Murnain undertook an Individual Study Tour of the United States of America in 2012 and aided the Democratic Party campaign. In 2013 Murnain was appointed Assistant General Secretary of NSW Labor. In February 2016 Murnain was elected by ballot as the first female General Secretary of NSW Labor. Federal Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, backed Ms Murnain, then aged 29, stating that \\"She's not to be underestimated. She'll make a strong NSW General Secretary.\\" In response to a report into the status of women within the NSW division of the Labor Party, commissioned in response to the sexual harassment claim, Murnain stated that her goal as General Secretary is to achieve cultural reform and strengthen Labor's affirmative action rules. Murnain introduced the Party's first code of conduct and announced the introduction of compulsory ethics seminars for newly elected representatives. At the 2016 NSW Labor Conference delegates voted in affirmative action reforms such as a women's mentoring program and targets for women to have equal representation in all elected party positions, across all council, state and federal electorates, by 2027. In the lead up to 2016 federal election, Murnain led a campaign strategy similar to Obama's \\"organising to win\\" campaign. Labor NSW won 24 of the available 47 seats, with half of NSW Labor seats held by women, meeting the party's affirmative action goal. Murnain brokered a deal between left and right factions of NSW Labor to have Linda Burney, NSW Deputy Leader, run for the federal seat of Barton. Burney was subsequently elected as the Member for Barton and became the first indigenous woman elected to the Australian House of Representatives. Murnain oversaw the local government elections in 2016 where Labor regained most councils across western Sydney, and three by-elections in Canterbury, Wollongong and Orange. Murnain-backed Sophie Cotsis to run in Canterbury and Paul Scully in the seat of Wollongong. Murnain was suspended as General Secretary of NSW Labor on 28 August 2019 after she testified before the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) to knowing, since September 2016, about a potentially illegal 2015 donation of $100,000 from Huang Xiangmo, a billionaire closely linked to the Communist Party of China, to the NSW Labor Party; and not disclosing the donation to relevant authorities.

It covers the town of Weipa on the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula, including the localities of Rocky Point, Trunding, Nanum, Evans Landing, and Weipa Airport. It is an unusual local government area as it is not governed and managed by a council elected by residents but rather by the company Rio Tinto Aluminium (which operates a bauxite mine in the area) through a governing body called the Weipa Town Authority. In June 2018, Weipa Town had a population of 4,240.  History  In 1955, New Zealand geologist Harry Evans discovered bauxite (the raw material used to make aluminium) on the western coast of Cape York Peninsula while he was exploring for oil. Further surveys established it was the largest bauxite deposit in the world. In November 1957, the Queensland Government approved a ¬£50 million project of the British Australian Consolidated Zinc group to develop a bauxite mine on the Cape York Peninsula to be operated by its newly created subsidiary, Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Pty. Limited (from 1960 known as Comalco). As part of the agreement, the government passed legislation to enable a town, harbour and treatment works to be established at the company's expense at Kumrunja (Rocky Point) on the south side of the Mission River. Under the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Pty. Limited Agreement Act (1957) the area for the town was excised from Shire of Cook and Comalco became the manager of the new town. In 1964 the first housing was constructed in the new township of Weipa at Rocky Point. In 1967 the Township of Weipa was officially opened by the Queensland Premier Frank Nicklin. In 1993, Comalco held elections to form a Citizens Advisory Committee to assist in the administration of the town. In 1997 the committee evolved into the present Weipa Town Authority.  Towns and localities  Unlike most local government areas in Queensland, Weipa Town consists of two disconnected areas. The first covers the town of Weipa () with a narrow connecting road to the harbour area (). The second area () covers the Weipa Airport. Having been excised from Shire of Cook, Weipa Town is still surrounded by the Shire. However, the Napranum Aboriginal Shire (formerly known as the town of Weipa South) and Shire of Aurukun (also excised from Shire of Cook) are very close by and, although also split in a number of disconnected areas are effectively neighbouring local government areas. Weipa is the only town in this local government area. The residential area of Weipa comprises three localities; from north to south, they are Rocky Point, Trunding, and Nanum. The harbour area is within the locality of Evans Landing. The airport area is the locality of Weipa Airport.  Weipa Town Authority  While Rio Tinto (formerly Comalco) remains responsible for the administration of the town, it discharges this obligation through the Weipa Town Authority. The Authority has seven members: four elected by the residents, two appointed by Rio Tinto, and one appointed by the Alngith indigenous people. Weipa Town is a gazetted local government area and the Weipa Town Authority undertakes the duties of a typical local government, such as: * town planning and community development * providing infrastructure and services * making and enforcing local laws * levying local government rates and charges Services provided by the authority include road maintenance, water supply, garbage collection, parks, sports ovals, and public swimming pools. The authority provides the Hibberd Library in Hibberd Drive, Rocky Point. However, the Weipa Town Authority is not a true local government authority as defined in the Local Government Act (2009) because it is part of a corporation. This has implications in relation to loan and budget requirements, Goods and Services Tax on rates, the development of land, and changes to the town boundaries. Unlike other local governments in Queensland, the Weipa Town Authority has a chairman rather than a mayor. In 2017, the chairman is Michael Rowland. In 2016, discussions took place in regard to \\"normalising\\" Weipa Town into a true local government authority . The three options under discussion were to make Weipa Town a normal local government authority with its present boundaries, to absorb Weipa Town back into the Shire of Cook, or to create a new Western Cape Region centred on Weipa.

Description  The Lewis Shaw Coleman House, built in 1914, is the first private residence in Lawrence County to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was added to the register in 2016 for its architectural significance. The two-story, \\"U\\"-shaped American Craftsman style \\"airplane\\" bungalow sits on a limestone rubble foundation and the first floor walls are brick. It features exposed rafters in open eaves, low-pitched gable roofs with wide overhangs, decorative gable beams, and a prominent front porch with tapered stone columns. Also on the property are the contributing carriage house (c. 1927) and garage (c. 1955). (includes 12 photographs from 2016)  The People  Lewis Shaw Coleman and his wife Mary Kate Miller Coleman, children of two prominent Lawrence County families, built the Coleman House in 1914 on a corner lot overlooking Oak Park in Aurora. Established in 1870, Aurora saw sudden population growth due in large part to a mining boom in 1885 which spiked the population over 3,400 by 1890. Aurora's population peaked in 1900 at 6,191 a gain of more than 77%. As the mining industry faded by 1910, the population had fallen 33% to 4,148. However Aurora's business infrastructure remained strong with three banks, three flour mills, a shoe factory, a daily and weekly newspaper, and three lumber yards including the M.L. Coleman Lumber Company and the T.A. Miller Lumber Company. McCord Lafayette (M.L.) Coleman, born 1859, was one of the business giants of Aurora operating six lumber yards in the region as well as a hardware and implement business. He founded the largest milling company in the county and served as president of a local bank. He was successful in mining, owned a 120-acre apple orchard, and a large herd of Jersey milk cows. Lewis Shaw Coleman was his only son. Thomas Alexander (T.A.) Miller, born 1858, was another Aurora business giant. \\"In 1897, Mr. Miller returned to the lumber business in Aurora, to which he had moved in 1892. He expanded until he owned ten yards and several sawmills in Arkansas. He built a brick block in Greenfield while a resident there, the first brick building in Miller, a town which bears his name, the courthouse at Mount Vernon and the Franklin school here.\\" In 1915, Mr. Miller would be elected mayor of Aurora. Mary Kate Miller was his eldest daughter. Mary Kate Miller Coleman, Lewis Shaw Coleman In 1914, Lewis Shaw Coleman and Mary Kate Miller, a high-profile couple in the community, were married with two young sons. They were well positioned to build a remarkable home when a prime building lot unexpectedly became available within three blocks of the center of Aurora. A grand Victorian home built in 1906 by Mrs. Jeanette Seburn on a prominent lot at the northwest corner of Park and College Streets had burned to the ground. Lewis Shaw Coleman purchased the newly vacant building site in 1913 planning \\"to have a fine residence erected.\\" As construction neared completion in 1914, The Aurora Advertiser pronounced the significance of the Coleman bungalow writing \\"Louis (sic) Coleman is completing a beautiful bungalow on East College\\", adding that such homes \\"...show the progressive spirit of the city. Builders here see the beautiful possibilities in these creations in the architectural lines.\\" Contemporary accounts of the construction did not note the architect of the Coleman House and the architect currently remains unknown. Fortune did not smile on the young Coleman family and in 1916, their youngest son Lewis Shaw Coleman Jr died at the age of five and in 1918, Mary Kate died at the age of 32, just six days after Lewis registered for the World War I draft. In February 1929, Lewis and his second wife Irene Madry Coleman signed a Promissory Note to the Bank of Aurora with their home as collateral. Following the stock market crash in October 1929, O.E. and Linda Moore purchased the Coleman House at a sheriff's auction on the Lawrence County courthouse steps for $2,500 in October 1930. The Moore family, the second owners of the Coleman House, went on to be the longest inhabitants - raising their family and living at the same address for more than 50 years. \\"O.E. Moore came to Aurora in 1926 and purchased the Summit City Creamery located in a small building in the west part of the present plant. It grew into a large butter plant, later shifting to the manufacture of cheese, with trucks fanning out for miles picking up milk at the farms. Mr. Moore was for many years president of the Aurora board of education.\\" Following the Colemans and the Moores, three other families have owned the home: Bill and Terry Duncan, Wayne and Mary Lou Holmes, Kelly and Mary Jo Johnston. All of these families cared for the architectural treasure envisioned by Lewis and Mary Kate.  The Architecture  In direct obvious contrast to the Victorian homes occupying the 200 block of East College Street, the young Colemans, still in their 20s, opted for the American Craftsman style incorporating originality, a visible sturdy structure of clean lines, prominence of handicraft, and local natural materials. The Coleman house is built with definitive Craftsman features including exposed rafters in open eaves, low-pitched gable roofs with wide overhangs, decorative gable beams, large windows to connect the house with nature, and a prominent front porch with tapered stone columns matching the battered stone foundation. Matching stonework is found both in the tapered limestone piers supporting the oversized open-timbered end-gabled front porch and in two full-height limestone chimney stacks at the rear of the home. The second floor ‚Äòairplane‚Äô level covers a smaller footprint than the main level below and is clad in wood shake shingles. It is a significant example of Craftsman Airplane Bungalow architecture in the Southwest Missouri Ozarks.  The National Register of Historic Places  The Coleman House joins four NRHP listings in Lawrence County: the Lawrence County Courthouse (Missouri) in Mount Vernon, the Pierce City Fire Station, Courthouse and Jail, the Lawrence County Bank Building in Pierce City, Missouri and the Old Spanish Fort Archeological Site near Mount Vernon. The Coleman House is the only residential property listed in the county. And it is interesting to note that the T.A. Miller family was responsible for two of the four county buildings: T.A. Miller was awarded the construction contract for the Lawrence County Courthouse in 1900; and his daughter Mary Kate Miller, along with her husband Lewis, built the Coleman House fourteen years later. Inclusion on the NRHP, the official list of historic places worthy of preservation in the United States, recognizes the architectural significance of the Coleman House and helps to raise awareness of the importance of historic preservation in Southwest Missouri. It does not place restrictions or limitations on the use, transfer, or maintenance of the property.

Summary  Hal and his crew are getting a treaty signed with Hibernia for ships and are coming home when a storm blows them off course. They are swept out into the Endless Ocean and after eight days, are running short on water and decide their only chance for survival lies in going west, farther into the ocean. Delirious with thirst, they see a tree branch and a seagull and in their state they don't realize that they must be approaching land. More coming soon When the Brotherband crew are caught in a massive storm at sea, they‚Äôre blown far off course and wash up on the shores of a land so far west that Hal can‚Äôt recognize it from any of his maps. Eerily, the locals are nowhere in sight, yet the Herons have a creeping feeling they are being watched. Suddenly the silence is broken when a massive, marauding bear appears, advancing on two children. The crew springs into action and rescues the children from the bear‚Äôs clutches, which earns them the gratitude and friendship of the local Mawagansett tribe, who finally reveal themselves. But the peace is short-lived. The Ghostfaces, a ruthless, warlike tribe who shave their heads and paint their faces white, are on the warpath once more. It‚Äôs been ten years since they raided the Mawagansett village, but they‚Äôre coming back to pillage and reap destruction. As the enemy approaches, the Herons gear up to help their new friends repel an invasion.

The OLF originally fought the Ethiopian Empire to liberate Oromo people and establish an independent Oromia state along with ELF and TPLF. Despite being the largest ethnic group with more than a third of the country‚Äôs population, the Oromo people have historically been marginalized from central roles in national politics and, many say, borne the brunt of historical injustices. The conflict began in 1973, when Oromo nationalists established the OLF and its armed wing, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA).  Background  The Oromo people are an ethnic group that mainly inhabit Oromia, Ethiopia, with communities in neighbouring Kenya and Somalia as well.Merriam- Webster Inc, Frederick C. Mish, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, (Merriam-Webster: 2003), p.876 They are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia and the wider Horn of Africa; according to a 2007 census, they make up about 34.5% of Ethiopia's population, and others estimate that they make up about 40% of the population. In 1967, the imperial regime of Haile Selassie I outlawed the Mecha and Tulama Self-Help Association (MTSHA), an Oromo social movement, and conducted mass arrests and executions of its members. The group's leader, Colonel General Tadesse Birru, who was a prominent military officer, was among those arrested. The actions by the regime sparked outrage among the Oromo community, ultimately leading to the formation of the Ethiopian National Liberation Front in 1967 and the Oromo Liberation Front in 1973.  Timeline   1970‚Äì1980  In 1974, the Ethiopian military ousted the imperial regime and seized control of the country. The new regime promptly arrested Oromo leaders; subsequently, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) was formed during a secret conference attended by Oromo leaders, including Hussein Sora and Elemo Qiltu. A group of armed Oromo fighters in the Chercher Mountains were adopted as the OLF's armed wing, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). The OLA increased its activities in the Chercher Mountains, prompting the Ethiopian regime to send its military to the region to quell the insurrection. In June 1974, General Tadesse Birru, an Oromo nationalist who had been arrested by the imperial regime in 1966 along with other high ranking military officers, escaped from house arrest and joined Oromo rebels led by Hailu Regassa in Shewa. Birru and Regassa were later captured and executed by the Derg regime. In late August 1974, an OLA unit came down from their stronghold in the Chercher Mountains and made their way closer to Gelemso, hoping that nearby fully grown crops would be able to hide them from Ethiopian soldiers as they advanced towards other nearby towns. Three of the unit's new recruits were unaccustomed to climbing long distances, so they spent the night around the bottom of the mountains, while the rest of the soldiers camped at the top. When an OLA soldier was sent to retrieve the three recruits, it was discovered that they had been killed by Ethiopian militiamen who had followed the unit to Tiro. A large group of Ethiopian policemen and militiamen surrounded the OLA position in the mountains, and the two opposing groups began to exchange gunfire. A group of Ethiopian soldiers led by General Getachew Shibeshi later arrived, and began to shell the stronghold with mortar rockets, killing most of the OLA's members, including Elemo Qiltu. The event became known as the Battle of Tiro. Contingents of the OLA continued to fight the regime after the battle and later gained a massive influx of recruits and volunteers after the Derg regime executed Tadesse Birru and Hailu Regassa. In 1976, the OLF established a stronghold in the Chercher Mountains and began reorganizing itself. A congress was created by Oromo leaders, which revised the 1973 OLF Political Program and issued a new detailed program. The program called for the \\"total liberation of the Oromo nation from Ethiopian colonialism\\". The conference is now known as the Founding Congress, and marked the beginning of modern Oromo nationalism.  1980‚Äì1990  In the 1980s, the OLF estimated that they had over 10,000 soldiers. They were poorly equipped in comparison to other rebel groups in Ethiopia at the time, such as the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) and the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The OLF also opened an office in Sudan in the 1980s, after its office in Somalia was closed down. During the 1980s, the government of Ethiopia was accused of using scorched earth tactics, such as burning down entire villages and massacring inhabitants. The OLF also lost several prominent members due to government ambushes and heavy fire; the secretary general of the OLF at the time, Galassa Dilbo, was nearly killed in one such ambush.  1990‚Äì2000  In the early 1990s, the Ethiopian Democratic People's Republic began to lose its control over Ethiopia. The OLF failed to maintain strong alliances with the other two big rebel groups at the time; the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) and the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF). In 1990, the TPLF created an umbrella organization for several rebel groups in Ethiopia, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The EPRDF's Oromo subordinate, the Oromo People's Democratic Organization (OPDO) was seen as an attempted replacement for the OLF. In 1991, the EPRDF seized power and established a transitional government. The EPRDF and the OLF pledged to work together in the new government; however, they were largely unable to cooperate, as the OLF saw the OPDO as an EPRDF ploy to limit their influence. In 1992, the OLF announced that it was withdrawing from the transitional government because of \\"harassment and [the]assassinations of its members\\". In response, the EPRDF sent soldiers to destroy OLA camps. Despite initial victories against the EPRDF, the OLF were eventually overwhelmed by the EPRDF's superior numbers and weaponry, forcing OLA soldiers to use guerrilla warfare instead of traditional tactics. In the late 1990s, most of the OLF's leaders had escaped Ethiopia, and the land originally administer by the OLF had been seized by the Ethiopian government, now led by the EPRDF.  2000‚Äì2018  OLF forces retreat into Kenya, February 3, 2006 After the Eritrean‚ÄìEthiopian War, the OLF moved its leadership and headquarters to Eritrea. The OLA allegedly began receiving military training and arms from the Eritrean government. On 25 July 2000, OLF and IFLO signed a peace agreement after five days of negotiations, thus ending 20 years of inter-factional fighting. In 2004, the Gambela Region-based Ethiopian Unity Patriots Front (EUPF) rebel group launched forays into Oromia with the help of Eritrea. These raids were only limited in scope, however, as the EUPF had no popular support among the Oromo people, despite having some Oromo members. In 2006, the OLA in southern Oromia retreated into Kenya in an attempt to regroup. That same year, Brigadier General Kemel Gelchu of the Ethiopian military took 100 of his soldiers and joined the OLF in Eritrea. Despite initially aiding the OLF as leader of its military wing, in 2008, General Kemel Gelchu took matters into his own hands and announced that the OLF would lay down its weapons and abandon its previous goal of seceding Oromia and instead work as a political party to democratize Ethiopia. Along with this announcement, he commanded OLF soldiers in south Oromia to lay down their weapons and surrender to the government. On 30 May 2015, various media outlets reported that the OLF had attacked a federal police station in the Ethiopian side of Moyale town killing 12 Ethiopian soldiers. This occurred weeks after Ethiopian forces swarmed across the Kenyan border and began absuing locals of Sololo town looking for OLF troops. These forces later responded to the attack by launching an attack on Moyale District Hospital and killing one guard.

During 1782, Tipu Sultan, the son of Hyder Ali took the reign of the fort and built fortifications. Tipu was invaded many times by the British forces. Tipu Sultan built the mosque during 1786-87 close to his palace. After several unsuccessful attempts, British forces under the command of Colonel Wellesly, made an attack on 4 May 1799 under the covers. The forces had 2,494 British officers and 1 lakh Maratha cavalry and Nizams soldiers totaling to a force of more than 2 and half lakh which attached less than 20 thousand soldiers in the fort who defended bravely, had it not been to the treacherous ministers poorniah and mir sadaq they would have repelled the invaders successfully. The treacherous ministers mixed dung and water in the gun powder Tipu was killed in the battle and the English had a treaty with the Wodeyar queen.

The plot concerns siblings who lure swingers to their Hollywood mansion, kill them, then - with long scenes of blood transfusions - drain their blood. Though there is no classical vampirism in the film‚Äîin the sense of supernatural beings or blood drinking‚Äîthe plot's focus on draining blood to prolong life has led to many sources considering it a vampire film.John L.

Larry uses his new rental property to bring various willing women for the purposes of sex, while Jason and Bridget watch through a secret peep hole. Unbeknownst to Larry, however, once he departs the scene, Bridget and Jason capture his sex partners and drain their blood in an effort to prolong Jason's life. Eventually, Larry's wife Robin (Clara Perryman) discovers his infidelity. While initially hurt and angry, she soon decides to rent the \\"black room\\" for her own sexual purposes. When Larry finds out his wife is also cheating on him, he becomes angry and jealous, arguing with her and finally agreeing to cease his illicit activities in exchange for her doing the same. Both partners agree to cease their activities in \\"the black room.\\" They soon discover, however, that Jason and Bridget have kidnapped their two children, and plan to drain their blood.

Set at the turn of the 21st century in Iraqi Kurdistan, the multi-narrator novel explores the relationship between an emerging political elite and intellectuals in contemporary Iraqi Kurdistan, portraying the Kurdish authorities' increasing authoritarian tendencies.It is the first Kurdish novel to be translated into English. The novel became best-seller in Iraqi Kurdistan in 2008. It was published in Kurdish under the title of Ghazalnus w Baghakani Khayal ÿ∫€ïÿ≤€ïŸÑŸÜŸàÿ≥ Ÿà ÿ®ÿßÿ∫€ï⁄©ÿßŸÜ€å ÿÆ€ï€åÿß⁄µ. Outline The lead character in the novel is a poet, Ghazalnus, whose outlook is in stark contrast with that of a powerful politician, nicknamed the Baron of Imagination. The Baron has his own scheme, to construct a beautiful district, ‚Äúa mini-paradise‚Äù, and he approaches the town's poets and intellectuals to help him with the design of the project. This is a satirical reference to the Kurdish authorities‚Äô liking for extravagant schemes, such as high-security residential areas and hotels, on which they spend public money, while failing to address essential political and social problems. Yet, he opposes the idea of artists and writers exploring taboo subjects - such as unresolved murders and corruption. In the multi-layered novel, a group of like-minded friends, led by a poet, go on an odyssey to find the bodies of two lovers killed by the authorities. The plot features elements of fantasy: the poet discovers a land that turns into an infinite garden at night, a group of women living in a shelter to escape domestic violence weave the world's biggest carpet, and a Hollywood film buff leads a group of blind children on an imaginary sea journey. Each chapter of the novel has a different narrator, and usually there are thematic and chronological connections between chapters. Characters Many of the characters in this novel and other works by Ali have significant names. Here, many of them have more than one name. * Ghazalnus, (literally \\"writer of ghazals\\"); also referred to as Bahman Nasser; poet; he represents intellectuals who don't yield to the pressures of money or intimidation. * The Baron of Imagination; a powerful politician who sees intellectuals as a threat and tries to win them over by carrot or stick. * Hassan-i Tofan, also known as Hassan-i Pizo; former assassin and member of Kurdish armed movement against the Saddam regime. He denounces his violent past after he joins Ghazalnus's inner circle. * Trifa Yabahri, another member of Ghazalnus's inner circle, and the most prominent female character in the book; an imaginative woman who helps women at a shelter weave carpets. * Majid-i Gul Solav, also known as the Imaginary Magellan; another member of Ghazalnus's group; a young film buff who has never left his hometown but embarks on imaginary journeys. Media Slate website's Joshua Keating wrote an article about the book, mainly focusing on the challenges facing translating Kurdish books into English. On September 5, Sarhang Hars published a news article on NRT English (Later re-published by E-Kurd Daily and became a source for two other reports which included interviews with both Bakhtyar Ali and Kareem Abdulraman.

Founded in 2001, Euratlas has created a collection of history maps of Europe from year 1 AD to year 2000 AD that present the evolution of every country from the Roman Empire to present times. The evolution includes sovereign states and their administrative sub- divisions, but also unorganized peoples and dependent territories. The maps show European country borders at regular intervals of 100 years, but not year by year. This leaves out many important turning points in history. Euratlas is considered a digital humanities company, and a scholar research software used in the field of Historic Cartography. It is broadly known among American and European universities, who mainly use Euratlas as a research tool and as a digital library Atlas.  The Sequential Mapping Policy  This concept was first designed by the German scholar Christian Kruse (1753-1827). Kruse, well aware that historical accounts are often biased for geographical, philosophical or political reasons, created a set of sequential maps in order to give a global vision of the successive political situations. Nowadays, the majority of atlases don't use this approach, but are event-based, like the well-known Penguin Atlas of History. The sequential approach intends to make the sequence of maps more neutral and suitable for students, historians and professionals of several fields. Although, this approach has been discussed as it leaves out many important history events that are not reflected on any of the maps because of the century interval.  The Geo-referenced Historical Data  Initially, the European maps by century were developed as vector maps. From 2006 on, they have been converted to a Geographic Information System (GIS) database, enabling geo-referenced data capabilities. The map information is distributed in several layers: Physical (Geography information layer); Political information layer (Supranational entities, Sovereign States, Administrative divisions, Dependent States and Autonomous peoples); and special layers for Cities and Uncertain Borders. The software database also contains much non-geographical information about political relationships between the various kinds of territories.  Map projection  Euratlas History Maps uses a Mercator projection, with the center in Europe. The maps include North-African coast and the Near-East, offering a complete view of the Mediterranean basin. Also the European Russia plains are shown, but not Scandinavia, specially Finland which is cropped off the map view.

Life  Victor Brown was born in Banes, Cuba, the son of Jamaican parents: John Brown, an engineer, and his wife Mirian, n√©e Brown. He trained as an engine-room seaman and left Jamaica for Britain in 1939, before serving in World War II. He subsequently performed (eventually, with his brother Noel, as the Brown Brothers) for the Entertainments National Service Association and the League of Coloured Peoples, and then in nightclubs. He worked with Prince Zulamkah and then briefly joined forces with the pianist Winifred Atwell. In 1947, he moved with his wife, Kameedea, n√©e Packwood, to West Africa, where she was working as a nurse. While there, he joined Ghanaian music troupes (playing with E. T. Mensah and Guy Warren) and tried to establish a timber business. When that failed, he returned to Britain and began performing with his brother Noel, working their way to the Gateways, a pioneering lesbian club in Chelsea, where he met the pianist Chester Harriott. The pair formed a duo, with Harriott on the piano and Brown singing (he was a tenor), an arrangement that proved successful; they spent eight years playing and touring as a variety act, Harriott & Evans (for Victor Brown was then known on stage as Vic Evans), mixing with a booming jazz scene and travelling across the world.

He is The Gompf Family Professor at the Johns Hopkins University and a board member of the American Chemical Society (ACS). Before his appointment at Johns Hopkins, Hernandez spent 20 years as a faculty member at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he became a full professor. In addition to his work as a professor, Hernandez is also the director of the Open Chemistry Collaborative in Diversity Equity, a program dedicated to creating more diversity in academia. Biography Born in Havana, Hernandez moved to Spain with his family when he was a child. The family later moved to Florida, where Hernandez attended school. When he was in high school, a research program at the University of Miami sparked an interest in science. He attended Princeton University, where he earned an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering and mathematics in 1989. Four years later, he received a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley. After serving on the chemistry faculty at Georgia Tech for 20 years, Hernandez moved to Johns Hopkins University in 2016. He has special interests in the dynamics of chemical reactions, transition state theory and non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics. Hernandez describes his area of study as \\"the interplay between molecular motions ‚Äî such as reactions or rearrangements ‚Äî and changes in their environments\\". Hernandez directs a program known as the Open Chemistry Collaborative in Diversity Equity (OXIDE). The program supports research and awareness into issues of diversity within chemistry departments. The program, which Hernandez started when he was at Georgia Tech, was initially funded by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and U.S. Department of Energy, and later the Sloan Foundation. OXIDE is dedicated to creating changes in science departments by making changes from the top down. This includes creating policies that allow for more diversity and create a more inclusive environments. In the fall of 2016, Hernandez was elected to his second three-year term as a board member of the ACS.  Awards  Hernandez has received numerous awards for his work in the sciences.

It is also the last episode to have the subtitle \\"Mad City\\". The episode was written by Seth Boston and directed by Louis Shaw Milito. It was first broadcast on January 30, 2017. In the episode, with Gotham now falling into darkness, Jerome and his followers begin to wreak havoc across the city while Jerome kidnaps Bruce to finish what he started on the night he died. His plan includes taking him to a carnival where citizens are used as the attractions for his amusement while Gordon, Alfred and Bullock rush to stop him. Meanwhile, Cobblepot sets off to find Nygma but soon discovers in which side Nygma is on. The episode is heavily based on the popular graphic novels The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: The Killing Joke, and Batman: Death of the Family, on which certain events are applied to the series. The episode received enormous praise from critics, with significant praise towards the nods to the comics, Mazouz's and Monaghan's performance and the ending. Plot Following the power outage, the GCPD is filled with criminals while the police officers attempt to arrest the criminals. Meanwhile, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) and his henchmen arrive at a warehouse and find Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) waiting there. He kills the henchmen and shows Cobblepot Isabella's wreaked car to reveal that he knows his involvement in her death. Kathryn (Leslie Hendrix) and a Court member (James Remar) discuss the events that are happening on Gotham with the member telling her to give the GCPD a chance although she is doubtful of his faith on \\"him\\". With the lights not coming back until the next day, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) discuss Jerome's (Cameron Monaghan) next move and remember that he talked with Lee (Morena Baccarin) and discover that he is planning to kill Bruce (David Mazouz). Nygma ties Cobblepot to Isabella's car, prompting Cobblepot to confess that he killed Isabella and did for his love for him. Nygma also puts a cauldron of corrosive acid tied to a chained big piece of ice so when the ice melts, the acid will kill Cobblepot. Bruce and Alfred (Sean Pertwee) are attacked at Wayne Manor by Jerome and his followers, who destroys the owl statue. Jerome takes Bruce and orders the followers to kill Alfred. Gordon arrives just in time to kill the followers and save Alfred. Jerome takes Bruce to a boardwalk circus where the citizens are used as game attractions for the followers' amusement. Jerome kills one of his followers and uses his blood to draw a face on Bruce's mouth. Meanwhile, Cobblepot manages to break free when a police officer helps him. He returns to Dahl Manor and is taken by Butch (Drew Powell) and Tabitha (Jessica Lucas). Jerome has Bruce tied to a post in order to close the event with a \\"boom\\" and has a cannon filled with a cannonball and knives in order to kill him. Gordon, Alfred and Bullock arrive and fight the followers while Jerome ignites the cannon. In the last second, Bruce frees himself and flees while Jerome follows him. Barbara (Erin Richards) tells Cobblepot that if he wants to live, he needs to call Nygma in order to kill him. However, Cobblepot realizes that love involves the sacrifice and discovers that he ruined Nygma's happiness for his and decides to die instead of calling. Nygma appears, revealing that he wanted him to die so he can see that he can't truly love anyone but is clearly moved by Cobblepot's statement that he can. Bruce escapes into a house of mirrors while Jerome follows him there. They fight in one of the rooms when Bruce gets the upper hand and brutally beats Jerome, disfiguring him. At Jerome's goading, Bruce takes a shard of glass to kill him but at the last moment, decides not to kill him. He leaves and reunites with Alfred. Jerome gets up and tries to attack Bruce, but is subdued by Gordon, who knocks off his face. Jerome is then arrested and taken to Arkham Asylum with his face being placed back. In Wayne Manor, Bruce tells Alfred about what happened and how he felt that what he did was justice. Alfred states the rules he cannot break and Bruce vows to never kill. Meanwhile, Kathryn talks with a now- brainwashed Five for their new purposes. When Five gets concerned, the Court member replies that he will go with someone to join them as \\"no one refuses the Court\\". He visits Gordon, revealing himself to be his uncle Frank Gordon, the man who wore the ring. Nygma takes Cobblepot to the harbor docks in order to kill him. Cobblepot continues pleading that he created him and that he still loves him but Nygma shoots him instead in the stomach and throws his body into the harbor. Production Development In November 2016, Drew Powell tweeted that the fourteenth episode of the season will be titled \\"The Gentle Art of Making Enemies\\" and was to be written by Seth Boston and directed by Louis Shaw Milito. Casting On November 2016, James Remar was cast as Frank Gordon, Gordon's uncle, in a role that was described as \\"The elder Gordon left Gotham after Jim's father died, but 25 years later, he's back and looking to reconnect with his nephew. But Frank has a dark secret that will force Jim to choose between saving his family and saving Gotham.\\" Remar is the second Dexter vet to join the show, the first being David Zayas. Camren Bicondova, Chris Chalk, Maggie Geha, Benedict Samuel, and Michael Chiklis don't appear in the episode as their respective characters. Despite the announcement in January 2017, no guests stars were announced with the episode's title. Reception Viewers The episode was watched by 3.46 million viewers with a 1.1/4 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a 4% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.60 million viewers with a 1.2/4 in the 18-49 demographics. With this rating, Gotham ranked second for FOX, behind Lucifer, third on its timeslot and sixth for the night behind The Odd Couple, Lucifer, a rerun of Kevin Can Wait, a rerun of The Big Bang Theory, and The Bachelor. The episode ranked as the 56th most watched show of the week and the 24th most watched show of the week in the 18-49 demographics. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall viewership of 5.09 million viewers and a rating of 1.8 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Critical response \\"Mad City: The Gentle Art of Making Enemies\\" received enormous praise from critics. The episode received a rating of 89% with an average score of 9.53 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.1 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"The Bruce/Jerome stuff was great here in the goofily malicious 'The Gentle Art of Making Enemies,' giving us this show's version of Batman vs. Joker. Elsewhere, with Riddler and Penguin, things didn't go so well as Ed's tired and convoluted revenge plot (thankfully) gasped its last breath.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the series a perfect 5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"If we had to go into hiatus (do we HAVE to? *sad face*) this was the way to go. Gotham has proved time and time again that it knows how to excite an audience, this episode was no exception.\\" Sage Young of EW gave the episode a \\"A\\" and wrote, \\"Gotham is a different show now than it was at the end of season 2, and the transition has been smooth. The violence and gore have been amped up to resemble the Gotham City we know from the movies. And these machinations of the town's underworld players are putting them on the brink of a war. While Oswald and Ed played out their Greek tragedy, Tabitha and Barbara were quietly killing all those 'old dudes' who used to call the shots. The crown is up for grabs. Justice is malleable. And Bruce Wayne is ready to get off the sidelines.\\" Karmen Fox of The Baltimore Sun wrote, \\"As much as I appreciate innovation, having a winter fragment of episodes was a terrible idea. Yes, it was explosive, and yes, it got viewers excited to see Jerome rejoin Gothams rogue gallery, but ending it after three episodes is a surefire way to lose momentum.\\" Sydney Bucksbaum of Nerdist wrote, \\"The Joker came, he saw, and he very nearly almost conquered on Gotham. But thanks to the combined efforts of Jim Gordon and a young Bruce Wayne, he was stopped before he could do any permanent damage to the city.\\" Robert Yanis, Jr. of Screenrant wrote, \\"Moreover, Ed and Penguin's friendship ‚Äî which was so key to the first half of the season ‚Äî now looks poised to develop into something far complicated, especially with the bloody way in which this week's episode wraps things up. While Penguin‚Äôs perpetual rise and fall has long been a narrative trend for Gotham virtually every season, Ed's story feels like it's just beginning, with the character's true destiny now seemingly right around the corner. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's look at 'The Gentle Art of Making Enemies' a bit closer before getting into any more specifics.\\" Kayti Burt of Den of Geek gave the episode a perfect 5 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"This show will always have its issues, but if it keeps delivering installments like this one, bolstered by the strong talent of its cast, production team, and directors, it makes a good argument for its continued existence in this era of Peak TV. If nothing else, it remains committed to its comic book tone and really is like nothing else on TV.\\" Accolades TVLine named Monaghan the \\"Performer of the Week\\" for the week of February 4, 2017, for his performance in this episode. The site wrote, \\"Monaghan is so good at being colorfully bad, it almost makes us angry every time one of his arcs as that joker, Jerome Valeska, comes to an end.\\" References  External links  Gotham (season 3) episodes 2017 American television episodes ","title":"The Gentle Art of Making Enemies (Gotham)"},{"id":"52940842","text":"Davey Lake may refer to: *Davey Lake (Alberta) *Davey Lake (Saskatchewan) See also *Davy Lake ","title":"Davey Lake"},{"id":"52940859","text":"Davey Lake is a lake in Red Deer County, Alberta, Canada.

The cognomen \\"Isauricus\\" is reminiscent of two consuls of the late Roman Republic, Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus, consul 79 BC, and his son Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus, twice consul in 48 BC and 41 BC; their descendants can be traced into the second century AD. Birley speculates that Antonius Isauricus may be descended from these Republican consuls through the female side. Quintus Antonius Isauricus is named in an inscription from Eboracum (York). The inscription was dedicated to his wife, Sosia Juncina, whom Birley speculates may have been related to another consul, Quintus Sosius Senecio, consul in 99 and 107. A fragment of the Fasti Feriarum Latinarum and a military diploma provide evidence of his consulate. Inscription at York The altar on display in the Yorkshire Museum The Inscription which names Isauricus is an altar dedicated to Fortuna by his wife, Sosia Iuncina. It was found in 1839 at the site of the Old Railway Station, York and is associated with the Roman Baths nearby. Dedications to the Goddess of fortune are often associated with bath-houses. The stone, measuring 71 x 40 x 38 cm and made of limestone, is inscribed with seven lines of texts.

Maltby, Rector of Morton, opened a mission in the village, which constructed a Mission Room out of four or five cottages. Around 1880 the congregation built an Iron Mission Church, which served until the permanent church could be constructed. The permanent church was built between 1900 and 1901 as a memorial to John Jackson of Stubben Edge, Ashover. The architect was Mr. Percy H. Currey of Derby.

The group was founded in July 2016 and publicly launched on November 11 after Trump won the 2016 United States presidential election. DisruptJ20's inauguration protests were a part of a wider array of protests organized both locally and nationally from a more extensive initial plan. The protests included efforts to blockade one bridge and to shut down security checkpoints. James O'Keefe and Project Veritas had some success infiltrating DisruptJ20's planned inauguration efforts. Description A Washington, D.C.-based political organization, DisruptJ20 (also appearing with an inserted space before \\"J20\\") had the initial stated aim of protesting and disrupting events of the inauguration of Donald Trump as 45th President of The United States. One organizer of the DisruptJ20 protests, Alli McCracken, stated that the group is protesting Trump's views on women, undocumented immigrants and Muslims. Al Jazeera described the members of the organization as \\"liberal activists\\". Steven Nelson of the U.S. News & World Report, after interviews with organizers and representatives, described it in December 2016 as the \\"more radical protest-organizing network DisruptJ20, which has more than 1,700 Facebook group members.\\" A representative of the organization has stated that it would also have demonstrated had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 presidential election. History and protest planning DisruptJ20 was founded around July 2016, about six months before Trump's inauguration. \\"J20\\" was chosen to stand for January 20, the scheduled day of the 2017 inauguration. DisruptJ20 was publicly launched on November 11, 2016 with a YouTube video and social media accounts. It and its aims were described in an interview with Legba Carrefour, \\"an organizer with DisruptJ20\\",While an individual with this name appears on various social media accounts (e.g., Twitter and Flickr), the existence of clear references in both the given name and the surname, to Haitian voodoo, directly via Legba and indirectly via Carrefour, make it possible that this participant's name is a pseudonym or nom de guerre. See this participant at Twitter, etc., and see the linked articles on the apparent direct and indirect voodoo references.There is no report as of February 1, 2017 that this individual bears any relation to the French multinational retailer, Carrefour. as According to Nelson of the U.S. News, the DisruptJ20s website in December 2016 associated the organisation with the \\"DC Welcoming Committee [DCWC] collective\\" (describing it as \\"being assisted by\\" the DCWC) and Nelson reports that DisruptJ20, at this time, involved individuals from an array of progressive groups (as individuals, rather than representing their groups). Nelson quotes Carrefour, who he describes as \\"a local anarchist handling press\\" for DisruptJ20, as indicating that \\"more than 200 people attended an organizing meeting at a local church ... on short notice\\" and that photographs \\"show[ed] supporters representing a range of ages and interests.\\" Regarding intent, Carrefour stated to Nelson, On January 14, 2017, about a hundred demonstrators met at the American University to plan and prepare their protests. Carrefour described their plans for inauguration week, beginning the weekend of January 14‚Äì15, 2017 (\\"MLK weekend\\"), indicating that DisruptJ20 was: * holding \\"an Action Camp ... doing a lot of non-violent direct action trainings\\" on that weekend; * sponsoring a \\"queer dance party\\" at the residence of Vice President Mike Pence, on Wednesday, January 18; * arranging an \\"action\\" for the DeploraBall‚Äîdescribed as an \\"Alt-Right Trump inaugural ball\\"‚Äîon Thursday, January 19, with the aim of \\"trying to shut that down\\"; * having, on the 20th, inauguration day, \\"blockades ... at all the checkpoints around the inauguration parade route and to get into the viewing area ... transit blockades all day ... several unpermitted marches, an especially big one at Logan Circle\\" at 10 A.M., and a permitted march at 12 P.M., as well as events going on throughout inauguration evening.\\" After the January 14 meetings, James O'Keefe of Project Veritas posted a video shot at pizzeria Comet Ping Pong in the capital showing members of the DC Antifascist Coalition, a part of DisruptJ20, planning to disrupt the DeploraBall at the National Press Building on January 19‚Äîthrough use of stink bombs (of butyric acid) and activation of the building's sprinkler system. DisruptJ20 countered that it had caught on to the Veritas operation and had thus fed its operative a false plot; however, based on the video, the DC police arrested a man associated with the group on January 19, 2017 for his alleged planning to disrupt the DeploraBall. Veritas released a second part to the video showing DisruptJ20 participants discussing their plans to create blockades for bridges and trains; as a result of the latter video, a DisruptJ20 organizer announced that the group would scale back on their blockade efforts, and only shut down one bridge. Inauguration actions, eve and day DisruptJ20's efforts in Washington, D.C. were a part of a wider array of nationwide protests, that included nationwide rallies such as Our First Stand: Save Our Health Care (organized by congressional Democrats and health care activists) and Poets Protest Against Trump (by such artists, on local city hall steps), both the weekend before the inauguration; the celebrity Love-a-thon (a Facebook- broadcast fund-raiser for liberal causes, featuring a number of film actors) on inauguration day, and the Women's March on Washington [D.C.] and hundreds of sister marches nationwide, the day following the inauguration. The DisruptJ20 protests were specific actions, organized in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland in particular. A number of their protest activities occurred throughout Washington on January 19‚Äì20, 2017. Protests involving DisruptJ20 members from a variety of groups occurred at the National Press Building during the day and into the evening, on the January 19. On January 20, DisruptJ20 participants linked arms at security checkpoints, attempting to shut down flow into the inauguration through these checkpoints. A post-event press release from DisuruptJ20, reported on by The Washington Post, state that \\"climate justice activists\\" numbering ca. 400 participated in physically blocking the inauguration security checkpoints, including a four-hour block of the checkpoint at 3rd and D Streets NW. The statement indicated, \\"[our] work is done.\\" In addition, DisruptJ20-associated attempts to block traffic through a sit-in occurred at the intersection of 12th and K Streets NW. Broad responses to the effort Comments both supportive and judgmental have appeared around the DisruptJ20 inauguration activities. Activist filmmaker Michael Moore indicated support for their efforts in the two cities, via Twitter. Publications ranged in opinion from support to criticism. The presentation from The Huffington Post took the form of an information article directing interested readers to the DisruptJ20 web page, and to various protests in which they could participate. Legal proceedings In February 2017, the organization announced fundraising and legal support for individuals arrested for January 20 activities. Those arrested on Inauguration Day were charged with rioting, and were released pending a court date. A class action lawsuit was filed for false arrest, and excessive force. On April 3, 2017, the Metropolitan Police Department raided the house of a DisruptJ20 activist as part of its \\"investigation into the conspiracy to riot.\\" On 17 July 2017, the US Department of Justice served DreamHost, the company hosting the DisruptJ20 website, with a search warrant for all information held about the site. The information requested in the warrant included the IP addresses of 1.3 million people who visited the site, as well as the date and time of their visit and information about the browser and operating system. In addition to this, the contact information, email content and photos of thousands of people was requested. DreamHost challenged the warrant in court, arguing that it was a \\"highly untargeted demand\\" that chilled its users' constitutional rights. The Electronic Frontier Foundation also called the warrant an unconstitutional fishing expedition. On October 10, 2017, Chief Judge Robert Morin of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia issued an order significantly narrowing the warrant's scope. \\"[W]hile the government has the right to execute its Warrant,\\" he wrote, \\"it does not have the right to rummage through the information contained on DreamHost's website and discover the identity of, or access communications by, individuals not participating in alleged criminal activity, particularly those persons who were engaging in protected First Amendment activities.\\" In late November 2017, six people charged with rioting went on trial. Prosecutors alleged that these six people were taking part in DisruptJ20 protests and vandalism. A jury trial found the six defendants not guilty on all counts in December 2017. On January 18, 2018, the U.S. Justice Department dropped charges against 129 people, leaving 59 defendants to face charges related to the DisruptJ20 protest. By early July 2018, federal prosecutors had dropped all charges against all defendants in the case.

Groups of hawkwatchers often congregate along well-known migratory routes such as mountain ridges, coastlines and land bridges, where raptors ride on updrafts created by the topography. Hawkwatches are often formally or informally organized by non-profit organizations such as an Audubon chapter, state park, wildlife refuge or other important birding area. Some hawkwatches remain independent of any organizing structure. Most hawkwatchers post their count numbers each day to hawkcount.org, a nonprofit website that coordinates hawkwatching data. Other platforms such as eBird are also used, but usually include other types of birds. Techniques and equipment A high flying osprey passes the Allegheny Front Hawk Watch as it migrates south for the winter. The distinct M-shape of the silhouette is a key identifier for this species. Hawkwatchers usually use binoculars, spotting scopes, and cameras to aid in the identification of flying raptors. Unlike other forms of birding, auditory cues are rare, for many raptors do not vocalize in flight. Instead, hawkwatchers rely on shape, flight behavior and plumage to identify raptors. Several books specialize in learning hawk identification, which is usually challenging because of the distances and the speed at which the raptors migrate. Hawks At A Distance and Hawks From Every Angle by Jerry Liguori help hawkwatchers identify raptors that are high in the sky, at odd angles, and appear unusually small. Unlike typical field guides, these books describe birds' motion, temperament and personality, something most significantly described in Hawks in Flight by Dunne, Sibley, and Sutton as gestalt. Hawkwatchers who want greater detail on subspecies view photo field guides like Raptors of Western North America and Raptors of Eastern North America by Brian K. Wheeler, Wheeler, Brian (2003), Raptors of Western North America and Raptors of Eastern North America. Princeton University Press. and his updated 2018 field guides with paintings, Birds of Prey of the West and Birds of Prey of the East. Wheeler, Brian (2018), Birds of Prey of the West and Birds of Prey of the East. Princeton University Press. . Definitions The word \\"hawk\\" in hawkwatching is used to describe common birds of prey. Typical North American raptor families and species are: * Accipiters ‚Äì Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii), northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus) * Buteos ‚Äì broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis), red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), red- tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), rough-legged hawk (Buteo lagopus), short- tailed hawk (Buteo brachyurus), zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus) * Crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) * Eagles ‚Äì bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) * Falcons ‚Äì American kestrel (Falco sparverius), merlin (Falco columbarius), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), aplomado falcon (Falco femoralis) * Kites ‚Äì Mississippi kite (Ictinia mississippiensis), snail kite, swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus), white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus) * Harrier ‚Äì northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) * Osprey ‚Äì (Pandion haliaetus) (only one surviving species) * Vultures ‚Äì turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), black vulture (Coragyps atratus) Hawk counters are responsible for keeping an accurate tally of the numbers of each species. Each hawkwatch usually designates an official counter responsible for certifying the count's accuracy. Organizations The Hawk Migration Association of North America (HMANA) is a membership-based organization committed to the conservation of raptors through the scientific study, enjoyment and appreciation of raptor migration. Hawk Migration Studies is the official journal of HMANA and is printed twice a year, for the spring and fall migrations. Notable hawkwatches Hawkcount.org lists over 300 hawk sites, with 173 recently active. In 2015, Hawk Migration Studies reported on 37 sites during spring migration, and 130 sites for fall migration. Noteworthy hawk sites include: * Allegheny Front Hawk Watch in Cairnbrook, Pennsylvania, which holds the record in the Eastern Flyway for the most golden eagles (386) counted in a year. This record was set in 2015 along with the one-day record of 74 golden eagles on October 24, 2015, which contributed toward the fall seasonal record of 320 golden eagles. (The single day and the fall total golden eagle records were broken in 2018 by Franklin Mt. Hawkwatch.)

He is portrayed by Zahari Baharov. He was a ruthless Bulgarian gangster who initially served as the loyal right-hand man of the powerful Bulgarian mafia boss, ex-cop and wealthy businessman Petar Tudzharov, only to be betrayed by him later on, which prompted him to become his enemy. Andonov eventually takes his seat as the new ruling crime lord of the Bulgarian mafia after Tudzharov's incarceration and death. Baharov's performance received critical acclaim and Andonov's character development was noted as one of the series's highlights as the antithesis to Martin Hristov, the main protagonist.  Early life  Ivo was born in a stable and good family of physicians and studied only in elite schools. While still very young, his parents went to work in Israel and Ivo was left in the care of a distant aunt. He eventually took to the streets due to the neglect of his family and impressed Petur Tudzharov while he was still building his criminal empire.  Description  He is Dzharo's violent and feared right-hand man. Ivo is not a typical criminal. He accepts everything as a military organization. He is a fan of various terrorist factions and thinks of himself as a criminal who fights with the unfair system. He consumes cocaine and drinks heavily, although it enhances his aggression. His biggest fear is that he will die at an old age peacefully in his sleep. He dreams of a heroic death, to become a legend. Season 1 In the first season, Andonov is introduced as Tudzharov's right hand-man and leader of his gang. Andonov is described as special by Emil Popov, who urges Martin to be incredibly careful around him. Andonov is described as sadistic, manipulative,violent and highly intelligent. A common theme throughout the series remains the fact that he is the only criminal who correctly guesses that Martin is an undercover cop from their very first meeting. His disdain towards Martin prompts him to prove to his boss that he is a cop. In Episode 1.2 we are introduced to his mother Cveta who he hides from everyone, showing a clear sign of weakness. She doesn't know that he is a criminal. Andonov and Tudzharov's relationship becomes increasingly strained as Martin starts to outperform him and gains Tudzharov's trust. When Tudzharov orders him to kill Sunny, Andonov defies him and keeps her alive and hidden from him, due to the fact that he has loved her all this time. Season 2 In season 2, Ivo started to go rogue from Tudzharov a little by little. In Episode 2.6 he planned with Rosen Gatzov, also known as The Hook, to rob the van with the profit of the selling in the shopping mole, but during the robbery, he and The Hook are ambushed by the police led by Emil Popov and they start to run. During the chase, Ivo was wounded and he returned in his house. His mother sent Sunny in the pharmacy to buy medicines. When a local criminal was arrested for robbery of the same pharmacy in which Sunny took the medicines, just after she went from there, CCTV footage was shown to criminal's attorney, who happened to be Tudzharov's lawyer too, Boyana Vasileva. Vasileva saw that Sunny is alive and passed it to Tudzharov. When Tudzharov found out about Sunny's fake death, he ordered Ivo's kill, but the assassin failed and Ivo killed him. Ivo, later, definitely departed Dzharo's group and started his own. Sunny, later, departed Ivo's house and moved to Martin's place. Ivo, then, went to Martin's place and told him to keep her safe and then returned to his house. After the conversation with Martin on her grave, Ivo entered his car and saw when police arrested Martin. Season 3 In season 3, after Tudzharov was arrested and sentenced, Ivo reunited his crew, The Hook, Adriana, and Zdravko Kiselov, also known as The Hair, and started his own criminal group. Later, Ivo recruited a new man, Krum, to be his right hand. In Episode 3.1, Ivo ordered Martins murder, but the attempt failed. In Episode 3.4, Ivo got hit by the biggest strike ever - Tudzharov ordered his mother's murder. Ivo arrived in his mother's place too late and saw her lying on the floor dead. He sat down, took her head in his arms and cried. In Episode 3.5, Ivo started business with pimping of prostitutes and VAT fraud. In Episode 3.8, Ivo is arrested on three counts - VAT fraud, pimping of prostitutes and murder. During the conversation with inspector Popov, who arrested him, Ivo showed him a clip on cellphone showing Popov's daughter snorting cocaine. In Episode 3.8, after the conflict with general Penev, Ivo ordered his murder and the general was murdered outside of the restaurant in which Ivo had the dinner. In Episode 3.9, Ivo ordered a robbery of the gold treasure, which was successful, but, later, the police found the hiding place of the treasure and returned it. In season 3 finale, Ivo ordered Martin's kidnapping. Ivo, later, met with Dzharo with The Hook and Tisho and revealed that he knows about Dzharo's daughter Nia. Dzharo, furious, shot Ivo and escaped and The Hook freed Martin to go after him. The Hook knelt near Ivo and Ivo gave him his cellphone and told him that he is expecting one call. Ivo, then, closed his eyes and mobile rang. The Hook and Tisho looked who is calling and saw who it was. When Popov came there, The Hook and Tisho weren't there. Popov ordered that Ivo be hospitalised. Season 4 It is revealed in season 4 that Ivo survived shooting and is now in relationship with Dzharo's daughter Nia. Because of Dzharo's shot, Ivo start to walk with a stick. In Episode 4.3, Ivo ordered Dzharo's kill, but, the attempt failed. Ivo told Nia he knows she went to met with Dzharo and that he needs to believe her. Later, Ivo was arrested for drug trafficking by Martin and inspector Zarev. Shortly after, Ivo was released from prison. In Episode 4.5, Ivo was abducted by Lizzard's men and got tortured. The Hook managed to free him. In Episode 4.7, Ivo with his men robbed casino owned by Dzharo and Bardem. In next episode, several of Ivo's places had been blown up by Dzharo's Turkish men. Later, Ivo was arrested for murder of one of the whores. Ivo was informed by his lawyer that his semen was found in her vagina, but Ivo told him that she only gave him an oral sex. Lawyer told him that the police now can have him another 72 hours and that the DA will order his arrest. In the same episode, Ivo again sent his men to kill Dzharo, but the attempt again failed. In Episode 4.9, Ivo was released because the girl who gave the testimony change it because Martin found out from Adi that Dzharo paid the girl to accuse Ivo. The girl's later found dead. In season finale, Ivo informed The Hook he is going to meet with Faruk, but in the finale moment, Ivo sent The Hook on that meeting.  Season 5  In season 5 premiere, Ivo took over Dzharo's business with heroin and freed The Hook from prison using a little beating. In Episode 5.2, Ivo found out about Dzharo's drug business with Italians and his nickname \\"Il kane\\" (in Italian \\"The Dog\\") and went in Rome, but he there found out somebody already came there who said \\"Il kane\\" sent him. He, then, found ou it is Nia when she came to meet with him. In Episode 5.9, Ivo sent his associate Dimitriev to pay off customs officer, but Dimitriev and officer ended up arrested. Later, Ivo found out the officer called five times Nia and he went to her apartment and revealed he knows she is trying to blackmail him. Ivo, then, hit her a few times and, finally, raped her and went from her appratment. Ivo was killed in the final episode of the series.

Born 26 October 1923 in Ajaccio (Corsica), died 4 March 2006 in Montpellier (H√©rault-France).  Lifetrajectory  Antoine Bonfanti, \\"Always say, tell, convince...\\" He began learning his profession as a trainee boom-operator on the film La Belle et la B√™te by Jean Cocteau. He is considered as being one of the pioneers of direct- sound in film-making on location: ‚Äúthe school of direct-sound is French - said the sound-engineer Jean-Pierre Ruh- it began with Antoine Bonfanti‚Äù. He is characterised by his collaborations with directors as Bernardo Bertolucci, Andr√© Delvaux, Amos Gita√Ø, Jean Luc Godard, Joris Ivens, William Klein, Chris Marker, G√©rard Oury, Alain Resnais, Ren√© Vautier, and Paul Vecchiali. (see filmography below). His primary occupation is the authenticity of sound: above all he likes building the whole universe of sound of one film, through every stage from filming to sound-mixing (that means the live-sounds, the ambiances in location and after the sound-effects, the dubbing and the mixing in auditorium). In this pattern, he had 120 films of which 80 feature films. Otherwise, his filmography includes about 420 titles of long and short Films of fiction or documentary; and within this number, some can be still missing because - as involved in cinema as in politics - Antoine did lots of \\"for free\\" that, may be, haven't been listed. Member of the R√©sistance and, after, volunteer soldier in the war-years 1943-1945; militant, communist by spirit, vigilante, he is part of SLON collective - which later becomes ISKRA - and of the Medvedkine-groups. He shared his sound-artist's talent and he has trained several generations of sound-engineers in many countries (Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Morocco, Mozambique, Peru, Portugal, Tunisia, Venezuela), where to make of the cinema is a matter of fight. The film \\"Antoine Bonfanti - Traces sonores d‚Äôune √©coute engag√©e\\" by Suzanne Durand, reconstitutes a professional path of more than 50 years which demonstrate a commitment going far-beyond the simple trade and his collaboration with a lot of film-makers; it is also an original approach of the sound's practical. He recounts it himself also, interviewed by No√´l Simsolo in a transmission on France-Culture, called \\"M√©moire du si√®cle, Antoine Bonfanti\\" on 20 August 1997, and broadcast during \\"Les Nuits de France-Culture\\" at midnight of 25 January 2016.  Biography  Antoine Bonfanti, Albania, 1988 Antoine, nicknamed \\"Nono\\" by his Corsican family, \\"Toni\\" by his war comrades, \\"Bonbon\\" within the world of cinema, was born in Ajaccio in 1923. The family leaves again for Africa in 1926, having already spent some years in Conakry in \\"R√©publique de Guin√©e\\", (formerly \\"Guin√©e fran√ßaise\\"). His father is \\"receveur principal des postes\\" in Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina-Faso (formerly \\"Haute- Volta\\"). Antoine spends some of his youth there but, when his eldest brother must go to high-school, the family returns to Corsica, before his father be appointed \\"percepteur\\" (tax-collector) at Saint-Rambert d‚ÄôAlban, and after at Touquet-Paris-Plage. As a child, he discovers the paroquial-cine in Corsica. At Touquet, the family goes to the cinema pretty often. He remembers fondly the showing of the film \\"Les marins de Kronstadt\\" d‚ÄôEfim Dzigan, organised by his father to mark the death of Roger Salengro in 1936, where spectators leave the theater singing \\"l‚ÄôInternationale\\". He is 13 during the \\"Front populaire\\". At Boulogne-sur-Mer in the boarding-school at the \\"Coll√®ge Mariette\\" - and on his train journeys - he uses to pass near the steelworks, red flags hanging from the rooftops; and he remains very touched by the striking workers who were raising their fists to salute the train. The \\"pros and con\\" fight in the school-yard. There, Antoine \\"has been lucky enough to have Jean Marcenac as his teacher of Philosophy and French, who opened up the eyes and his library\\". His political awareness began in June 1940, after the \\"dr√¥le de guerre\\". He didn't understand Paul Reynaud‚Äôs phrase who said after the debacle: \\"I don‚Äôt believe in miracles, but if someone were to tell me that a single miracle could save France, I‚Äôd believe in that miracle\\". But two days later the Germans were occupying Touquet. Later, boarding at College in Orl√©ans (his \\"correspondent\\" is a Corsican chief of police), he was expelled in November 1941 for knocking out the chief-supervisor who deprives him of his meal; Antoine was a lightweight boxer, (he was also a talented and competitive swimmer). He feels the pull of the resistance. He produces pamphlets on linoleum \\"in private\\", and tries on several times to reach England by small boats with friends. He is becoming dangerous for his father who is part of one resistance-movement; and when Antoine is called up, in May 1942, for the construction of the \\"Mur de l‚ÄôAtlantique\\", his father orders him to escape to Corsica (it‚Äôs his formerly correspondent who obtains a pass for him). He then forms part of the ‚Äú R√©sistance arm√©e urbaine‚Äù at the ‚ÄúFront National‚Äù (at this time: Front national pour la lib√©ration et l‚Äôind√©pendance de la France): ‚Äúwe were in a war of liberation against the Germans, and also in a war of revolution against the Petain-regime‚Äù. In 1943, he commit himself as voluntary-soldier in the ‚ÄúBataillon de choc‚Äù. He becomes ‚Äúchasseur‚Äù in the fourth company. After the Toulon-loading, his batallon goes up as far as Tyrol; Antoine loses numerous comrades on the way. To his great detriment, he is only demobilized in September 1945. He has two children from a first marriage, Jean-Claude and Francis. Years later, he married Maryvon Le Brishoual whom he met in Brazil in 1968, during the filming of ‚ÄúLe grabuge‚Äù (O tumulto) by Edouard Luntz, produced by Fox. They have three children: Kalanna, Sol√®ne and Ma√´l. En 1946, he took correspondence lessons from the ‚ÄúConservatoire des Arts et M√©tiers‚Äù; and thanks to his cousin, Mathieu Bonfanti, he was chosen as boomer-trainee on ‚Äú La belle et la b√™te‚Äù by Jean Cocteau, at the ‚ÄúStudios de St Maurice‚Äù where, in the following time, he learns all the roles, all the trades of sound. In 1948, he started to work at ‚Äú Radiodiffusion fran√ßaise‚Äù (which become RTF en 1949 and ORTF in 1964) where he learns ‚Äú √† faire ce qu‚Äôil ne faut pas faire‚Äù (what not to do). Ardent militant, he fights against the American politics which refuses to accept quotas; but with the ‚ÄúAccords Blum-Byrnes‚Äù, L√©on Blum sacrifices French cinema, in order ‚Äú to put France back on the right track‚Äù with the Plan Marshall accepted, and announced in June 1947. This activism didn‚Äôt stop him entering M.G.M. France (Metro Goldwyn Mayer), very famous at the time, where he acquired control of post-synchronisation and sound-mixing. In 1958, he began working with most of directors ‚Äú who counted during a period which counted and who fit, more or less, the Nouvelle vague movement‚Äù. He becomes acquainted with them at the SIMO - auditorium at Boulogne-Billancourt where he admired and learned lots with Jean Neny, the great inventor of many techniques of dubbing and mixing in auditoriums. When the film is shooting on location, he looks for other microphones, makes wind covers (bonnettes) for little booms for documentary; and later, he will spend a lot of time creating a model of square boom. In 1962, he makes the sound, with Pierre Lhomme as cameraman, for the now mythical ‚ÄúLe joli mai‚Äù, film by Chris Marker. He is part of SLON, which late becomes ISKRA (whose he is manager for some years). He is part also of the Medvedkine groups: it‚Äôs the extraordinary adventure with the workers from Rhodiaceta in Besan√ßon in 1967, and those of Peugeot factories in Sochaux in 1968. Also in 1962, he begins teaching several times a year at l‚ÄôINSAS in Brussels until the mid eighties. He took a keen interest by Cuba in 1963 during the filming of the documentary of Claude Otzenberger ‚ÄúFidel si, Fidel no‚Äù (‚ÄúCuba 63‚Äù). He donated then to the ICAIC his favorite appliances (Nagra III and his fetish micro Beyer M160). For him ‚ÄúCuba is the discovery of a single application of a socialist concept, but the Cubans, remarkable people, don‚Äôt deserve what they were to endure afterwards‚Äù. He is rebelling constantly against l‚Äôembargo (called blocus in Cuba) that U.S.A. established in 1962, and still applied. En 1989, he began teaching at EICTV, each year until February 1999. Directors such as Ren√© Vautier, Yann Le Masson, Bruno Muel, and Jacqueline Meppiel are his comrades, brothers and sister by spirit. But Antoine also is collaborator of people very different of his political family, so long as he can ‚Äúmake his sound to become the sound of the film‚Äù, and when it is all the easier for him to impose his direct sound on films where the actors improvise and can‚Äôt be dubbed in post-production (as Louis de Fun√®s in the films of G√©rard Oury). He is invited to talks, seminars and conferences on sound, is a jury member or president at film festivals, but he is mostly solicited to institutes, centers and cinema schools in numerous countries; the Cinemath√®que of Lisbonne devoted a week to him in 1985. In September 2000, being sick, he ‚Äúgoes down‚Äù to Montpellier to live with his wife Maryvon, near his beloved Mediterranean sea. That is there he dies in March 2006.

Accessibility apps are applications that increase the accessibility of a device or technology for individuals with disabilities. Applications, also known as, application software, are programs that are designed for end users to be able to perform specific tasks. There are many different types of apps, some examples include, word processor, web browser, media player, console game, photo editor, accounting application and flight simulator. Accessibility in general refers to making the design of products and environment more accommodating to those with disabilities. Accessibility apps can also include making a current version of software or hardware more accessible by adding features. Accessibility apps main aim is to remove any barriers to technological goods and services, making the app available to any group of society to use. A basic example is that a person who experiences vision impairments is able to access technology through enabling voice recognition and text-to-speech software. Accessibility apps are closely related to assistive technology.  History of Apps  The term apps as society knows it is a relatively new term. Strain (2015) mentions that Founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, is responsible for the way society thinks of mobile apps. In 1983, Jobs made a speech at a technology conference in Aspen, US where he predicted the ‚Äúevolution of a new digital distribution system‚Äù. Jobs described this system similar to a record store where it will be possible in the future to download software over phone lines. The term society knows as apps was a further development from early PDAs that held the game Snake on the Nokia 6110 phone. PDAs stands for personal digital assistant and is a small handheld computer that is capable of providing emails and internet access. The Apple App store was launched on 10 July 2008 with 500 apps. The Google Play Store, which was originally known as the Android Market was launched on 22 October 2008. It is interesting to note that the iPhone 3G was released just a day after the App Store opened. This was the first iPhone which was able to connect to 3G. Today, as of 2020 there is 2.2 million apps available to download on the Apple App store. Matthew Panzarino, co-editor of TechCrunch, believes that there are three phases of app history in mobile technology. Firstly, the initial gaming and utilities apps available in mobiles. This was seen in early PDAs and the first-generation iPhone. Secondly, apps that were focused around grabbing the user's attention and dominating the mobile home screen. Thirdly, today's phase in which apps are service layers, purpose built and utilise technology such as hardware sensors, location, history of use and predictive computation. Today in 2020 apps are not only present in technology such as mobiles and computers but also wearable technology such as watches.  History of Accessible Technology  Examples of accessible technology dates back to the 1800s. In 1808 Pellegrino Turri built one of the first typewriters to help a blind friend write. In 1916 Harvey Fletcher built the Western Electric Model 2A hearing aid. In 1934 the first issue of talking books was released so that blind people could listen to books. In 1995 Microsoft built in accessibility features into Windows 95 instead of previously having to purchase accessibility add-on.  The Need  In recent years there has been a push from society for app developers to increase accessibility. Fifteen percent of the world's population, experience some form of disability, equivalent to one billion people. Thus, accessibility apps are incredibly relevant in today's society. The main driver behind accessibility apps stems from society's increasing need for interconnectedness and growing demand for technology. In recent years there has been improvement in making technology more accessible for those with disability. However, the 2018 Australian Human Rights Commission states that more measurements need to be put in place in order to achieve equal access and for all groups of society to reap the benefits from today's digitally connected society. Pick and Azari (2008) highlight the importance in educating society about the progress but also the future around accessibility and technology.Screen display of accessibility options in the settings application of an iPhone  Accessibility Features in iPhones and Computers  People who experience disabilities are able to increase the accessibility of technology they already own through enabling specific features. For example, within the settings app on iPhones, there are several features that increase accessibility such as ‚ÄòAssistive Touch‚Äô, ‚ÄòClassic Invert Colours‚Äô, ‚ÄòColour Filters‚Äô and ‚ÄòMagnifier‚Äô. These adjustments found in iPhone settings have the ability to improve accessibility for people who experience disabilities such as motor impairments, visual impairments, colour blindness, and insensitivities. Hence, it is not just independent apps but also features within software that are able to increase accessibility for individuals.  Benefits  New technology, such as accessibility apps provide a platform to increase accessibility to services for people with disability. The lower costs of services made available through new technologies can improve equality amongst groups with disability. The benefits of new technology go beyond accessibility apps. Teachers have found that new technology has made learning material more accessible to students, and in turn, increased the number of students able to enrol in university courses. Apps have been developed to allow persons with disability to control their household and complete daily tasks through voice recognition software. Additionally, apps have been created that allow a person to take a photo of their surroundings and their phone will describe the photo. For example, a person who is vision impaired can go to a supermarket, take a photo of a product, and the app will name the product. Alternatively, a person can take a photo of another person and the app will describe the person's emotions audibly. People who live with disabilities face difficulties every day and in situations most people take for granted. The study (Mayordomo-Martinez et al., 2019) explains how an accessibility app functions and what apps need to consist of in order to achieve accessibility. The study uses ‚ÄòAccess Earth‚Äô as a prime example of an app that has made the outside environment more accessible to people. The app achieves this by locating and sharing facilities such as parking, bathrooms, and buildings in a free global community. Hence, this accessibility app has the ability to improve living conditions and individual's livelihoods. Furthermore, there are also apps, such as ‚ÄòAccessNow‚Äô that enhance accessibility by creating global communities for members to share and search accessibility information. A recent study (Yu, Parmanto, Dicianno, & Pramana, 2015) looked at the accessibility of mental health self-care app, iMHere, for individuals and its accessibility options for people suffering Spina Bifida. All of the participants in the study could use the app without assistance and stated they would use the app again in the future. However, there were complications in regards to accessibility of the app. Participants noted that due to each of their unique disabilities, there was a need for the app to allow personalisation by the user in order to modify content appearance such as the size and colour of text.  Case Study  This case study is an example of how new technologies can create barriers for people with disability if accessibility is not considered when designing technology. The Commonwealth Bank Eftpos system that was released in 2017 was an example of a poorly executed app that did not include accessibility features. The bank's new system was a tablet with no physical buttons or tactile keys, unlike other previous Eftpos machines. As such, the system was heavily criticised by the disabled community because of the touchscreen-only system which forced the blind and visually impaired to either give out their credit card pins when paying or to not go through with the payment. Stores with such machines were no longer accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired. Such people were forced to resort to family members to complete their weekly grocery shop because the individual had stopped going to retailers with these machines. Ultimately, this app which was created without the consideration of the disabled community meant that individuals and small businesses who were both using the app suffered as a result of payments being terminated. A few years later, in 2019, Commonwealth Bank of Australia agreed to introduce a software upgrade to the Eftpos machine to make it more accessible for the visually impaired. This was a result of a discrimination case brought against the bank and several other campaigns from vision-impaired Australians. CBA recognised its wrongdoing and introduced several actions to mend its mistakes. Firstly, they released upgrades to the software to include easier activation of the accessibility feature and other enhancements. Secondly, the bank added training available to merchants so they could understand how to use and implement the accessibility features to customers. Finally, CBA also created a video for card holders demonstrating how they can activate the accessibility features and use it when purchasing an item in store. CBA has stated that it is now committed to ensuring that accessibility will be a key factor and consideration behind further product development.  Discriminative Aspects of Technology  Technology can contain discriminatory aspects that can negatively affect individuals. Technology has the ability to violate human rights such as the right to privacy, security, safety, and the right to non-discrimination and equal treatment. New technology poses a threat to society's right to privacy. New technology has the ability to personalise products and services by altering preferences and characteristics relevant to the user. This process is possible because of the collection, storage, use and transfer of the user's personal information. Data collection of user's personal information can be used to influence search engine results, direct marketing, and opens up the possibility of mass surveillance by the government and private sector. For this reason, people are concerned with their online privacy. New technology has the ability to enhance but also threaten personal safety and security. For example, new technology such as drones can be used to identify threats to society or be deployed as weapons. Additionally, there is a form of technology that allows people who have diabetes to monitor their blood glucose and administers insulin when required. However, this same technology poses a threat to individuals because it enables a platform for cybercrime where abuse, exploitation, intimidation and threatening conduct becomes possible. New technology poses a threat to the right to non- discrimination and equal treatment. Economic inequality can become apparent when a particular labor force is replaced by robotics. Although, technology can also reduce inequality, for instance, sustainable energy technologies can improve the livelihoods of those living in developing nations. The access to technological innovations can vary greatly depending on how economically, socially, and physically marginalised a group is. New technology is becoming a part of everyday life whether it is shopping, transport, or accessing government services. For this reason, it is important that all groups of society have equal access to technology. Technology can discriminate against elderly people. For example, older people may have difficulty accessing online government services or could be at risk of personal health data being exploited. Children and young people can also be discriminated against by technology through the use of social platforms. People with disability are a group that are especially exposed to the discriminating aspects of technology. Currently, people with disability experience lower digital inclusion rate which means they are unable to access the same amount of digital platforms as those who do not have disability. Concerns remain surrounding affordability, lack of access to equipment, lack of awareness surrounding disability-specific options, insufficient touchscreen technology for people who have vision impairments, and that inaccessible communication technologies can impose employment discrimination to those with disability. There are several frameworks and models in place on a global perspective to protect people with disability from discrimination aspects of technology. For example, in Australia, The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) expect that all private sector companies and government bodies release information that is accessible to all groups of society. The Australian Government is required to test the experience of user's with disability of its services to ensure that information is accessible. In comparison, the US is known to have one of the most comprehensive legal frameworks to ensure online equality. However, these set of laws are not properly enforced and thus people with disability still lack equal online access. Apps need to be designed with ‚Äòuniversality‚Äô and ‚Äòinclusivity‚Äô in mind. App developers need to create apps that are accessible and inclusive to all groups of people including those with disability and specialised needs.

It is widespread in the warmer waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans as far east as New Caledonia and has colonised the eastern Mediterranean Sea from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal, making it a Lessepsian migrant. Description Upeneus moluccensis has an elongated body which has a sub-cylindrical anterior portion which becomes compressed towards the tail with two dorsal fins which are well separated, with the second dorsal fin directly above the anal fin. The caudal fin is deeply forked. The chin bears a pair of barbels which do not extend past the margin of the preoperculum. The upper and lower jaws, the palatine and the vomer are covered in brush-like or villiform teeth. The back is pinkish-red in colour contrasting with the white belly, from which it is separated by single longitudinal yellow stripe which runs from the operculum to the caudal fin peduncle. The dorsal fins are yellow in colour with 3 parallel red bars while the pectoral fin is a similar colour but lacks markings and the pelvic fin is colourless. The upper lobe of caudal fin is whitish and has 5 or 6 black diagonal bars while the lower lobe is unmarked except for the hind margin which is black as the second bar of the upper lobe extends along it. They can grow to 25 cm but are more usually 10‚Äì15 cm. Distribution Upeneus moluccensis has an Indo-West Pacific distribution, occurring from the Red Sea to New Caledonia and as far north as Japan, and south to northern Australia. It is the second most common member of its genus in New Caledonian waters. The first record of U. moluccensis in the Mediterranean was off Palestine in 1947, it had reached the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal as a Lessepsian migrant, and has become common enough in the eastern Mediterranean to be an important species in fisheries. Biology Upeneus moluccensis prefers sandy or muddy substrates where it searches for its food, mainly benthic crustaceans using chemoreceptors on its barbels. As they grow larger fish form a greater part of their diet. In the Mediterranean they spawn from late July up to September, the spawn and larvae are planktonic, settling to a benthic habit at 4‚Äì5 cm in length and becoming sexually mature when they are about a year old, c. 10 cm in length. They form large schools which are normally quite fast swimmers, occasionally stopping to feed. It is normally found at depths of 10-80m on continental or insular shelf regions. The maximum lifespan for fish caught off Turkey was found to be 5 years for males and six years for females. right Fisheries Upeneus moluccensis is sold fresh in markets as well as being utilized for fish meal and valued for its roe. It is regarded as a \\"trash fish\\" by fishermen in the South China Sea because of its relatively small size. The annual catch of goatfish at the fishing harbour of Visakhapatnam in India ranges between 2177 and 3463 tonnes, averaging 2859 tonnes, of which U. moluccensis makes up 18%. In the Mediterranean U. moluccensis is now an important commercial species for trawl fisheries.

L. Burch (1926-1996) The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique (1959), a landmark in the humane use of animals in research, education and testing. Russell and Burch introduced the concept of the Three Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) in the scientific community and provided a blueprint for combining animal welfare considerations and quality of research.  Early life  Bill Russell was born in 1925 in Plymouth, UK. His father, Sir Frederick Stratten Russell, was the Director of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. At the age of seventeen Bill started to study Classics at Oxford, but one year later he joined the army. In the autumn of 1944 his battalion was sent to Northwest Europe. Places he served included the area of Druten, the Netherlands. After the war Bill continued to study Classics and English Literature at Oxford but switched later on to Zoology, with Peter Medawar (later Sir Peter Medawar, Nobel Prize Winner Physiology, 1960) as tutor. In 1952 he defended his thesis on endocrinology and behaviour of the South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. As part of his thesis study he developed, together with Richard Murray, a more humane method of killing this species and introduced, for the first time in ethology, Sir Ronald Fisher‚Äôs method of experimental design and statistical analysis. He also studied psychology and worked for some time as an agricultural research fellow at Oxford.  Career  From 1954 to 1959 he worked, together with Rex Burch, on a project funded by UFAW (Universities Federation for Animal Welfare). The founder of UFAW, C. W. Hume, described Bill Russell as ‚Äúa brilliant young zoologist who happens to be also [a] psychologist and a classical scholar‚Äù. As the result of this project the Principles of Humane Experimental Technique was published in 1959. In the UK the Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments (FRAME), established in 1969, was among the first to recognize the importance of the Three Rs concept. In the years thereafter, recognition of the concept increased, first gradually but later on exponentially, when centres on animal alternatives were established in several parts of the world and also a series of World Congresses on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences was started. After publication of the book Bill worked for five years in private practice as a psychoanalyst and for two years as scientific information officer at the Commonwealth Bureau of Pastures and Field Crops, where he learned Japanese with the aim to understand the contents of agricultural publications from Japan. In 1966 he was appointed as a lecturer at the Department of Sociology, University of Reading, teaching several disciplines such as sociology, statistics, genetics and cultural evolution. He became Reader in 1971 and Professor in 1986. He was not aware of the growing impact of the book until the early nineties, when Marty Stephens, vice-president of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), took the initiative to institute the Russell and Burch Award for advancement of the Three Rs in science and Alan Goldberg, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT), invited Bill and his wife Claire to participate as guests of honour in the First World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences in Baltimore. They accepted the invitation. Bill announced the next World Congress in Utrecht with a song, paraphrasing Cole Porter's \\"Another Op'nin, Another Show\\" from the musical Kiss Me, Kate. Singing was one of his trademarks. Already from the time that he was Lecturer in Reading he used to present parts of his lectures in rhyming songs to the tunes of Gilbert and Sullivan. These were also the years that he earned great popularity in Great Britain by his original approach and through singing answers to some of the questions in BBC radio's Round Britain Quiz. For eight years he was a regular contestant on this programme, representing the West of England. Bill Russell published many research papers and several books on quite different subjects. Together with Claire he published Human Behaviour (Little, Brown,1961), Violence, Monkeys and Man (Macmillan, 1968), and Population Crisis and Population Cycles (1999). He also published a science fiction novel The Barber of Aldebaran (1995), wrote the introduction to The Myths of Greece and Rome (2000) and was a past president of the Folklore Society (and a regular contributor to their newsletter). The three Rs have been globally influential, including in Canada and India. In 2004, in response to a House of Lords Select Committee report informed by Russell's work, the UK launched the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research NC3Rs. Russell work has also been influential in shaping EU legislation.

He was a member of the Taller Torres-Garcia and in 1955 he created, together with his wife Carmen Cano, the Taller Collell of ceramics where for thirty years they taught their ceramic technique, the burnished engobe. Biography Josep Collell was born in Vic, Barcelona, Spain in 1920. His passion for drawing and painting was shaped in the Escola Municipal de DIbuix of Vic. In 1946 he was a founder member of ‚ÄúEls Vuit‚Äù (The Eight), a group of painters who shared a similar artistic concern and a desire to build bridges with the artistic strength previous to the Spanish Civil War. * 1950 He arrived to Montevideo and entered the Taller Torres-Garcia, as a student of the painter Julio Alpuy. * 1953 Carmen Cano, his wife, went to meet him. * 1955 He opened with her the Taller Collell (TC) of ceramics in Montevideo. He contributed to set up the Taller de Artes Pl√°sticas of Maldonado (1958), he taught in the Taller de Artes Pl√°sticas de Rocha (1962-1970) and also in the Museo Departamental de San Jos√© (1966). * 1961 He travelled with Carmen to Spain and learned the technique of enamel on copper. * 1967 With his students travelled to Bolivia and Peru. * 1970 Josep visited Spain and Italy. He admired Italian frescoes, he reencountered the Catalan Romanesque Art and he also visited the Museo del Prado. * 1977 He exhibited ceramics at the Gordon Gallery of Buenos Aires * 1982 At the request of the Uruguayan architect, Mario Payss√© Reyes, he made three ceramic panels for the Embassy of Uruguay in Buenos Aires. * 1985 He retired and closed the Taller Collell. From then on he devoted himself to painting. From 1986 to 1991 the TC was run by Carmen Cano and Josefina Pezzino. * 1994 Together with his wife made their last travel to Spain. He exhibited paintings in Vic and in 1995 in Barcelona * 2000 He received the Premio Moroli of ceramics and exhibited paintings at the Sala Figari in the Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores of Montevideo. * 2008 Organized by El Colectivo Cer√°mica Uruguay he received, together with the ceramic artists Marco L√≥pez Lomba, Tom√°s Cacheiro, Eva D√≠az and Jos√© Gurvich, an hommage to his ceramic career. He passed away on July 21, 2011 and Carmen in December 11th of that same year. The Taller Collell and its burnished engobe On entering the Taller Torres-Garcia (TGG), he discovered the Universalismo Constructivo. It was the name given by Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a to the artistic language he wanted to create for Latin America in order to unite the primitive vision of Pre-Columbian Art and the geometrical abstraction of the European avant-gardes. An aesthetic approach to project to applied arts as well, from ceramics to architecture, and a way to stimulate experimentation with different techniques and materials. In this atmosphere, Josep Collell first encountered ceramics. From the mid 1940s artists in the Taller painted commercial vessels with the oil painting technique, but when Jorge Piria provided them with a kiln, they could already fired glazed pieces. Julio Alpuy, Horacio Torres,Manuel Pail√≥s, Antonio Pezzino, Jos√© Gurvich, and Julio Otero, among others, applied the constructive language to ceramics. Collell started his first ceramic experiments with Antonio Pezzino, Carlos Martinez, Rodolfo Visca and Gonzalo Fonseca. They wanted to build their own ceramic forms and, inspired by the technique and forms of Pre-Columbian ceramics, they investigated the preparation of clay, its firing, and also made their first burnished engobes. Josep persisted in these preliminary essays in order to find a technique, the burnished engobe, that could allow him to paint, grease and burnish the pieces before firing so that clay became another painterly support. From the creation of the Taller Collell in 1955 to its closure in 1985, Josep and Carmen taught with great generosity and dedication the technique of the TC and they also projected a ceramic vision that left its artistic and human mark on the many students attending the Taller. Presently, Casa Collell, the home and Taller Collell, exhibits Josep's work and other artists of La Escuela del Sur. It is also the studio of the ceramicist Josefina Pezzino, who teaches, among others, the technique of the TC. Its legacy is also present in the ceramics of Lidya Buzio and Carme Collell who have spread it through United States and Europe.  External links  * Gurvich Museum * Cecilia De Torres LTD.

The fire charred the bus. Sixteen people on board the bus were killed and at least 26 sustained injuries, 10 serious and two life- threatening.

One of the seriously injured victims suffered third-degree burns. He died on 22 March, raising the number of victims to 17. The accident became the second most severe foreign bus crash involving Hungarians after the 1999 Deutschlandsberg bus crash in which 18 people were killed.  Accident  There were 56 people on board: two drivers, teenage students from the in Budapest and adults accompanying them including one teacher's family, returning from skiing in France. The Setra S317 GT-HD coach was travelling on the A4 motorway at San Martino Buon Albergo near Verona, when, for unknown reasons, the vehicle collided with the traffic barrier and then crashed into a bridge pylon. The collision crushed the right side of the coach up until the middle door and it caused a fuel fire almost immediately.The fuel tank of this type of bus is in front of the front wheel: Setra. With the front door obliterated and the middle door blocked by the pylon, the surviving occupants had to break out windows on the left side to be able to escape; one student ran through the bus breaking windows with a hammer, and was later found dead. Most people on board were sleeping at the time of the accident. A physical education teacher and his wife returned to the bus several times to rescue students. Both of their children died in the accident, and the teacher suffered burn injuries on his back during rescue. Other drivers on the road stopped to help, giving the survivors clothes and blankets, and a cell phone to call families. One driver Lanfranco Fossa stayed for over an hour to help translate for rescue crews, as the students did not speak Italian, only Hungarian and English. There were reports that a following truck driver had noticed \\"something wrong\\" with one of the coach's wheels, and black smoke coming from the rear. Italian authorities found no braking marks on the scene of the crash.  Reactions  Both the Hungarian Police and the Hungarian Ambulance Service (OMSZ) sent a team to Italy to assist the accident investigation and to help the survivors. To help the survivors and victims' families in coping with the psychological shock after the crash, several Hungarian psychologists travelled to Verona. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni expressed condolences for the victims of the accident. The Hungarian government declared 23 January as a national day of mourning in memory of the victims. On that day, Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n, President J√°nos √Åder, Parliamentary Speaker L√°szl√≥ K√∂v√©r and other officials attended a military ceremony in which the national flag at Kossuth Lajos Square in front of the Hungarian Parliament was raised and then lowered to half-mast. Public institutions including BKV buses displayed a black flag, multiple television stations displayed a black ribbon or a black station logo, and several entertainment venues cancelled concerts and events. The Italian ambassador to Hungary and hundreds of students, parents and relatives gathered outside the school mourning the accident and paid homage by lighting candles, memorial photos, drawings and laying flowers.  Investigation  Hungarian Foreign Minister P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥ confirmed that an investigation into the cause of the accident began soon afterwards. According to the Hungarian Foreign Minister, the driver lost control of the coach and that investigators had found no brake marks at the scene. The bus company, Pizolitbusz Ltd, is being investigated; the owner told media the bus had been in good condition. Analysis of the crash revealed that the barrier placed on the side of the highway did not behave according to the safety regulations: instead of bending and guiding the vehicle back to safety, it broke, causing a punctured wheel and acting like a rail trap carrying the bus into the bridge pylon. There was no reinforcement or doubling in the barrier structure before the dangerously close bridge pylon, as is usual in such locations, and the barrier structure was anchored on soft ground rather than concrete. Light poles mounted dangerously close to the guardrail (inside the deformation zone of the barrier, where they should not have been mounted) were knocked out by the bus, causing an electrical short circuit and igniting leaking fuel. Italy's State radio reported that a Slovenian truck driver driving behind the bus, noticed a problem with one of the wheels of the bus and tried to alert the driver of the bus. The broadcaster continued to report that the Slovenian truck driver stayed at the scene, attempting to help until investigators arrived.

It was screened in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition section of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. The film had its world premiere in the Forum section at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival. Both Nana Ekvtimishvili and Simon Gro√ü were awarded Best Director at the Sofia International Film Festival, where their film was entered in the International Competition section. Plot Manana (Ia Shughliashvili), a 50-year-old woman, decides to leave her family, husband, children, and parents. The reasons and rationale for her decision are initially and largely unknown to her family, and seem to remain a mystery to them throughout the entire story. Her perspective, however, is slowly disclosed to the audience. Manana‚Äôs decision to challenge the religious expectations of women in her community gives ‚ÄúMy Happy Family‚Äù an enlightened feminist streak, owing much to its central performance. Manana, a school teacher with a career and income of her own, rents a small flat on the outskirts of town. At a local market, and quite by coincidence, she runs into a former high school classmate who invites Manana to attend their 35th high school reunion. Attending the reunion and visiting with her former friends, a devastating secret is revealed. Her husband, Soso, had an affair while married to Manana and fathered a boy, who is now 13 years old. Weeks later, posing as a meter-reader for the gas company, Manana visits this woman and her son as a way to see them both in person. While living in her flat, Manana also discovers her brother Rezo has spoken to her new neighbors about her life, her decisions, and her situation, and while her brother seems to believe his actions are an attempt to \\"defend\\" his sister from strange men, Manana views his actions as an intrusive violation of her privacy, dignity, and personal agency. Meanwhile, Manana's own son who still lives with Manana's parents and his father brings his pregnant girlfriend to the family home to announce his surprise marriage. Manana's daughter is heartbroken to learn her new husband is having an affair (which Manana had accidentally discovered, but had not disclosed). The film ends as Manana poses several important questions to her husband Soso, and the audience is left to wonder what his responses might have been. Cast  Critical reception  After the Sundance Film Festival, the film was screened in Berlinale forum to positive reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 86 out of 100 from 10 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Eric Kohn of Indiewire writes, \\"My Happy Family was shot by Romanian cinematographer Tudor Vladimir Panduru, and recalls many of the strengths found in recent Romanian cinema, which often peers into the hectic personal dramas of characters who are smothered by social expectations. The story is laced with lovely melodies and traditional songs that play off Manana‚Äôs internal desperation; the camera roams freely around her in crowded scenes that show just how much the groupthink alienates her from her own needs.\\" In The Hollywood Reporter, Jordan Mintzer states that the film is \\"a simple, somewhat mundane scenario that, in the hands of a terrific cast and two talented filmmakers, is transformed into a minor Greek comic-tragedy, with one fearless woman trying to stave off loved ones who smother her with guilt and affection.\\" Village Voice critic Bilge Ebiri said the film was \\"one of the best films of the year.\\" References External links 2017 films 2017 drama films Films from Georgia (country) Georgian-language films Drama films from Georgia (country) ","title":"My Happy Family"},{"id":"52941522","text":"Last Mountain Lake Bird Sanctuary is a National Historic Site of Canada, located in the rural municipality of Last Mountain Valley No. 250 in Saskatchewan. The migratory bird sanctuary was the first established in North America. The area is within the Last Mountain Lake National Wildlife Area, an International Biological Program site, and includes adjacent uplands. The site is used as a staging or nesting area by numerous migratory and colonial bird species, including the sandhill crane and the endangered whooping crane. The lake has rich spawning grounds used by numerous fish species, including the vulnerable bigmouth buffalo. It was recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1987, its centennial anniversary, for its undisturbed natural areas, among them the wetlands, shoreline, forest, and adjacent grasslands, and for being the first bird sanctuary in Canada. History In 1887, Lieutenant- Governor of the North-West Territories Edgar Dewdney recommended the establishment of an area to protect wild fowl. On 8 June 1887, an Order in Council established the Dominion bird reserve at Last Mountain Lake. It was the first bird sanctuary established in North America. A parcel of land of about was reserved as a breeding ground, encompassing the northernmost of the lake's shoreline. In 1917, it was officially named Last Mountain Lake Bird Sanctuary, and was managed and operated by the Fish and Game League. In 1921, it was protected under the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act. Description Last Mountain Lake Bird Sanctuary is located in the Northern mixed grasslands, It is characterised by mud flats used by shorebirds and marshes used by waterfowl at the north end of the lake, whose water level is managed \\"within a series of basin\\" by control structures built by Ducks Unlimited Canada. A dam at the south end of the lake is used to control overall water depth. The shoreline is primarily sandy, interspersed with rocky or gravelly tracts, and features numerous peninsulas forming bays between them. The shallow marshes also feature potholes and saline wetlands that support the reeds lining the shore. Throughout the lake are several natural islands. The surrounding uplands consist of native prairie and low-lying grassland, much of it alkaline. Access to the migratory bird sanctuary is permitted, with seven roads connecting to the site. The site is subject to the federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulations, which prohibits hunting migratory birds, or destroying, disturbing, or removing migratory bird nests and eggs. Permitted activities include hiking, fishing (subject to provincial regulations), and boating. Fauna The autumn North American bird migration sees as many as 400,000 anatidae and 75,000 sandhill cranes stopping at the site. The lake's islands also support various prairie bird and waterfowl species that nest in colonies. The whooping crane, an endangered species, has been recorded to use the lake as a staging area during its migration. Numerous fish species inhabit the lake, which \\"provides some of the richest spawning and nursery grounds in Saskatchewan\\", including the vulnerable species bigmouth buffalo, a filter-feeding fish. The land surrounding the lake is inhabited by various prairie mammals, and is used by deer as a wintering site. National Historic Site On 24 June 1987, the Last Mountain Lake Bird Sanctuary was officially recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada. The dedication ceremony was presided by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The designation was granted primarily because it was the first sanctuary \\"to afford protection to migratory birds\\" that had been established in Canada. Among the elements cited for the designation are undisturbed natural features, including the wetlands, water and shoreline, forest, and adjoining grasslands. Also cited were managed features, including the dam and other water control features, and nearby crop fields that lure birds.

Synopsis In a setup which has been compared to a country house murder mystery, the novel tells the story of sixteen humans who gather on the isolated planet Damiem to witness the passage of a nova front from the Murdered Star; over the course of the book, the truth about the motives of these tourists, the destruction of the star, and the reason for Damiem's isolation are revealed. Reception Tiptree's two novels have received less attention than her short fiction: one publication claiming that Tiptree had less control over her intense vision at novel length is The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, which criticises \\"moments of overt sentimentality\\" and \\"excesses of subplotting\\" in Brightness Falls from the Air. Tiptree's biographer, Julie Phillips, felt that the greater conventionality of this novel was a response to Algis Budrys's criticism of her plots, which Phillips thinks she took too much to heart. Graham Sleight, writing for Locus Magazine, disagrees with aspects of Phillips's and Clute's assessment of the novel, arguing that Tiptree's work from after the revelation of her identity has not received appropriate consideration. While he calls Brightness Falls from the Air a melodrama, he argues that it possesses \\"extraordinary power\\" and that Tiptree \\"has an attentiveness in this book to other issues, most obviously the visual, that she doesn't have elsewhere.\\" Dave Langford reviewed Brightness Falls from the Air for White Dwarf #85, and stated that \\"Few survive the meagre scatter of happy endings.

Biography Early career Tsuchihashi was born in Saga prefecture and graduated from the 24th class of Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1912 and the 32nd class of the Army Staff College in 1920. In 1921 he was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, and from 1923 to 1924 was assigned to learn French at the Tokyo Foreign Language School in Kanda, Tokyo. He was stationed in Europe between 1924 and 1927 as a military attache to France and the League of Nations. After his return to Tokyo, he served as a battalion commander in the 1st Infantry Regiment, and in various administrative posts within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. In August 1935, on his promotion to colonel, he was given command of the IJA 20th Infantry Regiment. In August 1937, he was assigned as a military liaison to France. World War II After his promotion to major general in July 1938, Tsuchihashi became chief of staff of the IJA 21st Army in August 1939, which was transferred to combat operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War as part of the China Expeditionary Army. The primary role of the IJA 21st Army was the Canton Operation (the invasion of Guangdong Province in southern China), together with the Imperial Japanese Navy‚Äôs 5th Fleet, which it completed by the end of the year. The IJA 21st Army was disbanded on February 9, 1940, and Tshuchihashi returned to Tokyo to become military liaison to the Chinese Embassy. After his promotion to lieutenant general in August 1941, he was sent to Taiwan in September 1941 to command the newly-formed IJA 48th Division. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the IJA 48th Division was among the first Japanese forces to land in the Philippines as part of the IJA 14th Army, and Tsuchihashi's forces captured Manila, but did not participate in the Battle of Bataan. Instead, in January 1942 his division was transferred to the control of the IJA 16th Army in eastern Java, where was assigned the capture of Surabaya and its strategic oil fields on 7 March 1942. Afterwards, Tsuchihashi and the IJA 48th Division was subsequently assigned to garrison the island of Timor. Although the island had been captured by Japan in the Battle of Timor, much of the island was still in the hands of Australian and Dutch commandos. Tsuchihashi launched a major counter-offensive in an attempt to push the Australians into a corner on the south coast of the island. The Japanese also recruited significant numbers of Timorese civilians, who provided intelligence on Allied movements. . The island was secured when the remaining Australian commandos were evacuated in December 1942. In November 1944, Tsuchihashi was sent to French Indochina to reorganize and take command of the 38th Army. In March 1945, he played a crucial role in the Japanese coup d'√©tat in French Indochina and became the provisional Governors-General of French Indochina. Tsuchihachi maintained the Japanese policy of neutrality in Indochinese internal politics, and formed a government of French-trained but nationalist ministers.Hammer, Ellen J. (1955), The Struggle for Indochina 1940-1955: Vietnam and the French Experience, Stanford University Press, pp. 481Just before the Japanese surrender, Tsuchihashi met with envoys of the Viet Minh and agreed to turn over power to their movement; however, only days later, French forces arrived to reimpose colonial rule. After the surrender of Japan, Tsuchihashi was taken prisoner by the Nationalist Chinese in Hanoi and held in a prisoner of war camp in Guangdong province, China. In January 1948, he was transferred to French control in Saigon, where he remained until he was released in July 1949. He returned to Japan in June 1950, where he lived in obscurity until his death in 1972.

He was member of the National Liberation Army, and later the National Liberation Front. Bouhouche is known for his nationalist activism in the Middle East and The United States of America supporting the Algerian Revolution against French colonisation and oppression. First Algerian holder of a Ph.D. in political science, his professional career started at the Algerian presidency with Houari Boumediene. Few years later he decided to join the University of Algiers, then the Arab organization of Administrative Sciences as senior expert, in Amman (Jordan). He held various senior positions in academic and scientific circles, both in his country and abroad, and has been awarded several prizes for his academic achievements. The former General Secretary of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said that Bouhouche is one of the most prominent specialist in the fields of political science and public administration.  Early life  Bouhouche was the first born of Hocine and Yamina Kaddour. He lived in El-milia until 1953 when he moved to Constantine and continued his education in the Institute of Abdelhamid Ben Badis. In 1956, he joined the National Liberation Army in Tunis. Two years later, he was sent by the National Liberation Front to Kuwait in order to continue his education and then in the USA in 1960. From an early age, he was very active and eager for great achievement. Bouhouche was among the founding members of the General Union of Algerian Muslim Students chapter of Kuwait, actively participating in promoting the Algerian cause in the Gulf countries and the United States.  Education  Bouhouche continued his secondary education in Shuwaikh secondary school, at Kuwait, and received his B.A. and M.A. from Northern Illinois University. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Missouri at Colombia, in 1970, after that pursued his summer study at the University of California in 1963, and Mary Queens College at the University of Oxford in 1965.

Ability to enrich the field of political science  Bouhouche is one of the most prominent specialist in the fields of political science and public administration and methodology. This was said by Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former General Secretary of the United Nations, who described Bouhouche's book Evolution of Theories and Political Systems as one of the best books he has ever read about political science. He appreciated his efforts to compare political systems of Chinese, Russian, Cuban and Algerian revolutions. The leaders of each revolution succeeded in developing their own particular political systems. In the field of public administration, Bouhouche wrote three outstanding textbooks. He founded the specialty in political science called the science of organization. This Department was created in 1971 when Mohamed Seddik Ben Yahia decided to make reforms in the programs of high education. Mr. Ben Yahia invited Mr. Bouhouche and talked to him about his desires to create the science of management at the Algerian universities. Professor Bouhouche advised Mr. Ben Yahia to focus on the field of public administration, but he said that this subject is taught at the national School of Administration. At the end, the Minister responded favorably to Bouhouche's proposal and created the Department of Sciences of Organization. Bouhouche and his Jordanian colleague Dr. Mohamed Mahmoud Thneibat have written one of the best books in the science of methodology, in the year 2000. Up to now, the book has been re-edited and published 8 times by the Office of Academic Publications, students and researchers in social sciences have learned a lot from this book.

This is a comprehensive listing of the bird species recorded in Rocky Mountain National Park, a park in the U.S. state of Colorado. This list is based on one published by the National Park Service (NPS). Between when the NPS list was published and mid- July 2020, 18 more species have been added through eBird. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. This list contains 283 species and eight identifiable subspecies or forms. Unless otherwise noted, all are considered to occur regularly in Rocky Mountain National Park as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The tags below are used to designate the abundance of some less-common species. Some of the species which the NPS lists as unconfirmed have documented records in eBird. *(R) Rare - \\"usually seen only a few times each year\\" per the NPS (60 species) *(U) Uncommon - \\"likely to be seen monthly in appropriate habitat and season and may be locally common\\" per the NPS (82 species) *(O) Occasional - \\"occur in a park at least once every few years, varying in numbers, but not necessarily every year\\" per the NPS (75 species) *(H) Historical - \\"not in park\\" per the NPS, but historical records exist (6 species) *(Unc) Unconfirmed - \\"Attributed to the park based on weak...or no evidence, giving minimal indication of the species' occurrence in the park\\" per the NPS (12 species) *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to North America by humans (5 species) Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae A female mallard Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils. *Greater white-fronted goose, Anser albifrons, lakes, marshes (O) *Canada goose, Branta canadensis, lakes, marshes, rivers (U) *Wood duck, Aix sponsa, lakes, marshes (R) *Blue-winged teal, Spatula discors, lakes, marshes, rivers (U) *Cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera, lakes, marshes, rivers (U) *Northern shoveler, Spatula clypatea, lakes, marshes, rivers (R) *Gadwall, Mareca strepera, lakes, marshes, rivers *American wigeon, Mareca americana, lakes, marshes, rivers (R) *Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos, lakes, marshes, rivers *Northern pintail, Anas acuta, lakes, marshes, rivers (R) *Green-winged teal, Anas crecca, lakes, marshes, rivers (U) *Canvasback, Athya valisineria, lakes, marshes (R) *Redhead, Athya americana, lakes, marshes (U) *Ring-necked duck, Athya collaris, lakes, marshes, rivers (U) *Greater scaup, Aythya marila (O) *Lesser scaup, Athya affinis, lakes, marshes (U) *Surf scoter, Melanitta perspicillata (O) *Bufflehead, Bucephala albeola, lakes, rivers (U) *Common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula (O) *Barrow's goldeneye, Bucephala islandica, lakes (O) *Hooded merganser, Lophodytes cucullatus (O) *Common merganser, Mergus merganser, lakes, marshes, rivers *Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis, lakes, marshes (U) New World quail Order: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits. *Northern bobwhite, Colinus virginianus (H) Pheasants, grouse, and allies Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae A dusky grouse Phasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies.

Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. *Black swift, Cypseloides niger, cliffs, rocky areas, waterfalls (U) *Chimney swift, Chaetura pelagica (Unc) *White-throated swift, Aeronautes saxatalis, cliffs, canyons, rocky areas (U) Hummingbirds Order: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae A male broad-tailed hummingbird, the most common type of hummingbird in Rocky Mountain National Park Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. *Ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris, montane forests (O) *Black-chinned hummingbird, Archilochus alexandri, montane forests (R) *Calliope hummingbird, Stellula calliope, montane and subalpine forests, meadows (R) *Rufous hummingbird, Selasphorus rufus, montane and subalpine forests, meadows (U) *Broad-tailed hummingbird, Selasphorus platycercus, montane and subalpine forests, meadows Rails, gallinules, and coots Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *Virginia rail, Rallus limicola, marshes (U) *Sora, Porzana carolina, marshes (U) *Common gallinule, Gallinula galeata, lakes, marshes (O) *American coot, Fulica americana, lakes, marshes (U) Cranes Order: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae Cranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds.

She was largely instrumental in founding the Social Art Club of Syracuse, New York. Hicks appeared before the Woman's Congress in 1875 and 1876, urging that the subject of art education should be promoted by associations for study similar to the Social Art Club and Portfolio Club of Syracuse, and that public exhibitions, loan exhibitions and museums should be established. She urged the matter through art and educational journals. In 1879, she was called to Boston to assist in the Prang art educational work in the public schools. Hicks brought to the art educational movement exceptional qualifications for directorship. She had received not only technical art training, but she had also studied the history and literature of art. As the art educational movement has developed throughout the country, Hicks was recognized as one of the leaders. She was deeply interested in the kindergarten and industrial movements in education, and did much to bring them into harmony with art teaching in the public schools. She was one of the pioneers in summer school teaching. Early years and education Mary Amelia Dana was born in Syracuse, October 7, 1836, daughter of Major and Agnes A. (Johnson) Dana. The Dana family had a record in New England of over 250 years, its immigrant progenitor, Richard Dana, having come to this country in 1640, and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From him, the line continued through Daniel,2 Thomas,3 Daniel,4 Daniel,5 to Major Dana, who was of the sixth generation, Mary Dana being of the seventh. Major father was a merchant who supported forward movements. Her mother, Agnes, a poet and artist, was a leader in the literary society of Syracuse; she lived to the age of 94 years. At the age of two years, Hicks had learned the alphabet from large handbills. For some time, she was a pupil in a private school close to her home. Throughout her school life, she was found equal to children three or four years older. She was graduated from the Allen Seminary, Rochester, New York, in 1852, after a course of study in mathematics, the languages, and history, with general study of the sciences; and later she pursued special studies at Harvard University and at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. On her 20 birthday, 7 October 1856, she married Charles Spencer Hicks, a promising young lawyer of Syracuse. In less than two years, her husband was drowned. Art educator In 1858, Hicks faced financial troubles while needing to raise a young daughter. She starting teaching private pupils, most in drawing. Her work with these pupils led her to consider the influence of art instruction on education. Drawing was commonly regarded as an end to be attained only by the specially gifted. Close study and wide observation confirmed her in the belief that drawing should be a study not for the few only, but for all, a means of expression for every child, and therefore should be an integral part of public school education. Receiving the appointment of supervisor of drawing in the public schools of Syracuse, she visited several of the larger cities in the country, to observe school conditions. She found that drawing had a place in nearly every course of study, but that there was actually very little work of merit accomplished. More favorable conditions existed in Boston than elsewhere, but even there, drawing was not given the prominence to which she believed it was entitled. About this time Walter Smith was called to Massachusetts to become the head of art education in the State. He established the Normal School in Boston (now Boston State College), and gave considerable impetus to the study of art. Hicks visited him in Boston, and, introducing his books in Syracuse, found them helpful in the study of historic ornament, supplying in some measure the examples necessary for her work. Several of her classes in the high school numbered seventy or eighty pupils each. In order that the children might be properly taught, she formed teachers' classes that were conducted after school hours. In addition, she closely supervised the work in all the schools, ready to help the teachers with suggestions and encouragement. Her supervision of the schools of Syracuse extended over more than 10 years. Exhibitions of public school drawings were held at the high school building. These exhibitions, together with exhibitions made at the State Teachers' Association and at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, were all factors in the progress of art education in the public schools. In Syracuse, they attracted the attention of broad-minded people, and comprehensive reports upon them were made by physicians, architects, and other people of education, among whom were Dr. Martin B. Anderson, President of University of Rochester, and Dr. Andrew Dickson White, President of Cornell University. Endeavoring to spread the influence of art, Hicks assisted largely in the development of the Social Art Club of Syracuse, the purpose of which was the reading of the history of art and the study of historic and current art. Hicks was president of the club for five years, and through her efforts, its members were able to gather illustrations and to pursue a systematic course of reading relating to ancient, early Christian, and modern art. The club was popular, the waiting list being filled with names of women of high social standing. The Social Art Club was the second club formed in Syracuse, being antedated only by the Portfolio Club, an association of Hicks's pupils. Prang Educational Company Mary Dana Hicks Prang From the beginning of Hicks's connection with the Prang Educational Company in 1878, she was adviser on all the educational phases of the work. Even before her name appeared as joint author of the various publications prepared by the company, all questions involving educational influence and value were brought to her for judgment and advice. Her experience and insight as to the needs of the teachers contributed largely toward making possible the wide introduction of the Prang work in the public schools of the country. Her wisdom helped to make the Prang work acceptable to the educator. Hicks was among the first to point out that the instruction in art given in the public schools should cover entirely different ground from that given in the art schools and studios. She taught clearly the difference in the purpose of the two -‚Äî the one being intended for those specially gifted by nature, while the other means the development of art expression in every child. Advocating these views, she was a frequent speaker at art and educational associations. The difficulties attending the introduction of a comparatively new work and the lack of public school training on the part of supervisors led them to seek frequent conferences with Hicks, and many supervisors submitted to her criticism outlines for work in their schools before giving the work to teachers and pupils. With the need of closer and more systematic instruction for teachers and supervisors becoming apparent, the Prang normal art classes for home study in form, drawing, and color, with instruction by correspondence, were organized in 1887. They were designed to assist public school teachers in preparing themselves to teach the subjects of form, drawing, and color. The advantages of these classes were quickly seized upon by hundreds of teachers in all grades, by principals of schools, and by supervisors. On April 15, 1900, she married Louis Prang (1924‚Äì1909), of Boston, the art publisher. After his death in 1909, Hicks and her step-daughter, Rosa, moved in together, and Hicks studied at Radcliffe College (AA Degree, Art, 1916), and Harvard University (Master's Degree, Education, 1921). She died in 1927. Affiliations Hicks was a charter member of the Massachusetts Floral Emblem Society. She was president of the society in 1898 and 1900. She advocated for the adoption of a floral emblem for the State of Massachusetts. Hicks was a member of the Anti-Imperialist League, the Wintergreen Club, the New England Women's Club, the Boston Equal Suffrage Association for Good Government, the Twentieth Century Club, Women's Educational and Industrial Union, the Boston Business League, the Woman's Alliance, the Eastern Kindergarten Association, the Walt Whitman Fellowship, the Copley Society, the Unity Art Club, the Public School Art League, the Harvard Teachers' Association (of Cambridge, Massachusetts), the Massachusetts Forestry Association, the Massachusetts Industrial Art Teachers' Association, the Social Service League (of New York City), the Onondaga County Historical Association and the Social Art Club (both of Syracuse), the Eastern Art Teachers' Association, the Western Drawing Teachers' Association, the National Educational Association, the American Association for Physical Training, the Massachusetts Prison Association, the Massachusetts Society for Aiding Discharged Convicts, the American Park and Outdoor Association, and the Appalachian Mountain Club. She was also a proprietor of the Boston Athenaeum and a subscriber to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

The Curiosity Rover imaged what may be the first mud cracks (desiccation cracks) ever found on Mars. They may have been formed from drying mud. The site, called ‚ÄúOld Soaker,‚Äù was within an exposure of Murray formation mudstone on lower Mount Sharp. It is hypothesized that these cracks formed more than 3 billion years ago and then were buried by more sediment. All this material eventually turned into rock. Later wind erosion removed the layers that covered the cracked layer. The cracks were filled with material which was resistant to later erosion. This erosion resistant material formed raised ridges, as some of the surrounding layer was removed. This is the first sighting of mud cracks. Previously, Curiosity has examined cracks and ridges of different shapes that were made by groundwater carrying minerals, such as calcium sulfate. Cracks for this process were caused by the pressure of overlying sediments fracturing rock. Gale Crater held ancient lakes that varied in depth and area over time, and sometimes disappeared. Mud cracks show that there were dry times when lakes disappeared. Besides this evidence of mud, Curiosity has found evidence of ancient lakes in older layers and also in younger mudstone. Nathan Stein, a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology led the investigation. Wikimudcracksdensevarious.jpgProbable mud cracks appearing as ridges, as seen by Curiosity Rover.

Competition background Over a 12-year career in Speedway, he rode for six teams. In four consecutive years - 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964 - he rode for teams that ended their seasons at the bottom of the table.Bamford,R & Shailes,G (2007). ‚ÄúThe Story of Oxford Speedway‚Äù. He later found regular success when competing in Grasstrack. When riding in Grasstrack, Hagon started to develop a racing machine, with the assistance of Essex motorcycle dealer and competition sponsor Tom Kirby, creating a lightweight bike powered by a JAP engine. In 1958 he established a business building speedway and grasstrack bike frames in his mother's garden shed, but progress was interrupted in 1960 when he went on tour in Australia with the national England team.

The Porlock ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3,300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that the stones represented supernatural entities for the circles' builders. Although Exmoor witnessed the construction of many monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being Withypool Stone Circle. The Porlock circle is about in diameter and contains thirteen green micaceous sandstone rocks; there may originally have been more. Directly to the north-east of the circle is a cairn apparently connected to a linear stone row. No evidence has been found that allows for absolute dating of the monument's construction, although archaeologists have suggested that the cairn dates from the Early Bronze Age, the circle being a Middle Bronze Age addition. A small lead wheel found inside Porlock Stone Circle suggests that the site was visited during the Romano-British period. The site was rediscovered in the 1920s and since then a variety of stones have been added to it; its current appearance is a composite of prehistoric and modern elements. In 1928 the site was surveyed and excavated by the archaeologist Harold St George Gray. A second excavation took place under the leadership of Mark Gillings in 2013. Location The circle is located two and three-quarter miles south-west of the village of Porlock, in the south-western English county of Somerset. It is one mile south of the A39 road and is immediately to the west of the lane headed south to Exford. The ring is at an altitude of almost above sea level, and is positioned 10 kilometres (six and a half miles) north of the Withypool Stone Circle. The land on which the circle is located slopes from the north-east to the south-west. From the circle, a range of different Bronze Age round barrows, or tumuli, are visible at different points in the surrounding landscape. Among the nearest are Alderman's Barrow, Black Barrow, the two Bendels Barrows, the Rowbarrows, and the Kit Barrows. On the east-northeast side of the circle is the Berry Castle earthwork camp, which dates from the Late Iron Age or Romano-British period. Context The circle, photographed in 2014 While the transition from the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic in the fourth and third millennia BCE saw much economic and technological continuity, there was a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in what is now southern and eastern England. By 3000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic were no longer built, and had been replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. Stone circles are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's south-eastern corner. They are most densely concentrated in south-western England and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen. The tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2,400 years, from 3300 to 900 BCE, the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300 BCE. These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation. This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, but may have been deliberately left as \\"silent and empty monuments\\". The archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead, and wood with the living. Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities. Stone circles in Exmoor There are only two known prehistoric stone circles on Exmoor: Porlock and Withypool Stone Circle. The archaeologist Leslie Grinsell suggested that the circular stone monument on Almsworthy Common was \\"probably\\" the remains of a stone circle, although more recent assessments regard it one of the stone settings, a different form of monument that is more common across Exmoor. Archaeologists have dated these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, and have noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, on Dartmoor. In contrast to the two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor. Detail of the circle This scarcity of large stones may explain why Neolithic and Bronze Age communities used small stones, termed miniliths, in the two Exmoor circles and in other monuments within the region. There are nevertheless other constructions in the area, such as the clapper bridge at Tarr Steps and the three-metre Long Stone at Challacombe, which do use locally sourced large megaliths. This suggests that larger stones would have been available had the sites' builders desired, and that the use of miniliths was therefore deliberate. Exmoor also has a henge, near Parracombe, although it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, linear stone rows, and stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might also explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here. Most of the surviving prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture. For this reason it is likely that the surviving sites are not a reliable indicator of the original extent of these sites. Description Porlock Stone Circle has a diameter of and a circumference of approximately . The stones in the circle are green micaceous sandstone originating from the Devonian period, and were probably collected in the local area. Following his excavation of several stone settings, the archaeologist Mark Gillings argued that three forms of stone were deliberately incorporated into the circle: small uprights, low uprights, and larger stones that are positioned in a sloping position. Most of the latter were thin wedges that had been deliberately selected for their shape or flaked to give them a tapering form. Commenting on those cases where the majority of the stone is below ground rather than protruding from it, Gillings suggested that such a positioning may reflect a \\"deliberate inversion of the upright stone ideal\\". This concept of inversion is also evident at contemporary sites like Holme timber circle in Norfolk and, according to Gillings, might reflect \\"a strong chthonic element\\" to Porlock Stone Circle. Map of Porlock Stone Circle Investigation in the 1920s found ten upright stones and eleven prostrate ones, and concluded that there would have probably been about forty-three stones in the circle, each spaced about apart. The largest gaps in the circle were on its north-west and east-southeast sides, where the stones may have been removed for use as road metal. In 1950, it was noted that some of the stones had since been disrupted by military training during the Second World War. When the site was surveyed in 1989, thirteen stones remained in the circle, several of which were found to be in different locations to the 1920s. A 2009 survey by the Exmoor National Park Authority found only ten. A fuller archaeological investigation in 2013 revealed eleven upright stones and eight fallen. Gillings noted that as it exists in the twenty-first century, the circle is \\"clearly an amalgamation of prehistoric and wholly modern standing stones\\". Directly adjacent to the north-east of the circle is a cairn which has been denuded, many of its stones being removed. There is a linear setting of small stones to the southeast of the circle's edge. First recorded in 1975, at the time the row contained eight stones, six of them upright, covering a length of . The stones were mostly very small and barely visible in the turf, and were spaced at around intervals. In 2012, a burn of the heather revealed that there were five more stones on the southeastern end of the row, indicating a total distance of . The relationship between this stone row and the stone circle is unclear because road construction and quarrying has taken place in the area between the two. The trajectory of the stone row would pass through the cairn adjacent to the circle. Gillings argued that the stone row and cairn were part of a wider monumental landscape incorporating Porlock Stone Circle. He suggested that the cairn was built in the Early Bronze Age, with additions of a rough paving around its perimeter made in the Middle Bronze Age. He also put forward the possibility that the stone circle was built during the Middle Bronze Age as part of a wider \\"re-organisation of the landscape\\" around the cairn. Romano-British use During the 2013 excavation, a four-spoked lead wheel measuring in diameter was found buried in the circle. Although it could not be unequivocally identified, it resembled Late Iron Age and early Roman votive items that are sometimes found in Britain and (more commonly) Gaul. If this identification is correct, it would suggest that Porlock Stone Circle was known about and visited during the Romano- British period. Investigation The circle was rediscovered in the early 20th century by E. T. MacDermot, a man who lived in the Lillycombe estate near Porlock. He knew of several stones on Porlock Common but only noticed the wider circle after the heather was burnt away. MacDermot was aware that the archaeologist Harold St George Gray had investigated Exmoor's Withypool Stone Circle in 1905, and informed him of the discovery. In September and October 1928, Gray surveyed the Porlock circle with the permission of the landowner. He also briefly excavated a small area in the centre of the circle, where a dozen slabs of stone were revealed but no charcoal. In August 2009 a resistivity survey of the site was carried out by Gillings and fellow archaeologist Jeremy Taylor, both of the University of Leicester. They did so at the behest of the Exmoor National Park Authority, which commissioned the research as part of their Monument Management Scheme. This survey indicated that there had been sub-rectangular structures situated around the circle at some point in the past, although Gillings and Taylor acknowledged that excavation would be required to determine at what period these existed. Gillings oversaw this excavation in 2013. His team opened a trench measuring around the circle's northern arc. No artefacts from the period of original construction were revealed, nor were any sealed, undisturbed deposits suitable for environmental sampling and dating. A second trench was opened to examine stones located to the east of the circle, which Gillings's team believed had been part of the stone row. Heritage management The site has been scheduled as an ancient monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, giving it a level of legal protection from alteration. Surveys have shown a marked deterioration in its condition ‚Äì in 1950 Gray could identify 21 stones as part of the circle, but by 2009 the survey on behalf of Exmoor National Park Authority found only 10. Stones have also been added to the circle in recent years, and heritage managers face the question as to whether they should be removed or accepted as part of the circle's on-going biography.

Newspapers including The Seattle Times said it was Seattle's largest protest march in history. The march route was from Seattle's Central District through Westlake Park in Downtown Seattle to the Seattle Center. Drawing an estimated 120,000 to 175,000 marchers according to police and organizers respectively, more than the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, the March filled the entire route through downtown by early afternoon, making vehicle traffic across the route impossible. It was expected to be the third largest protest march in the United States on January 21, after the Women's March on Washington (D.C.) and the march in Los Angeles. An unusual feature of the march is that it was planned to be held in silence. The event was named using the spelling \\"womxn\\"; organizers stated that this naming was meant to symbolize intersectionality with the transgender community. Effects Sound Transit and King County Metro rerouted many bus routes and added additional Link light rail service in anticipation of disruption to the city's transportation grid. The march was routed on South Jackson Street through the Chinatown-International District neighborhood, causing major traffic disruptions. Some businesses in the neighborhood reported large losses in sales, taking place in the lead-up to the Lunar New Year (the largest shopping day of the year in the neighborhood). While restaurants reported good sales, grocery stores that rely on bulk purchases reported losses of up to 65 percent. Prior to the march, business leaders warned that the march would disrupt sales and wrote open letters in the International Examiner asking march participants to return to the neighborhood to offset losses. Participation by people outside of Seattle Hundreds of participants came to Seattle in organized groups from Eastside cities including Sammamish and Kirkland by charter bus, the Kitsap Peninsula by Washington State Ferries, and other Washington locales. Other Pacific Northwest marches Other events in Twisp, Spokane, Yakima and Walla Walla in Eastern Washington and numerous cities in Western Washington, as well as Portland, Oregon drew additional thousands of marchers. The event at the state capitol in Olympia had 10,000 attendees. For days, regional knitting shops were sold out of pink yarn used to make pussy hats crafted and worn by the protestors.

The film stars Sanjay Dutt, Aditi Rao Hydari, and Sharad Kelkar. Principal photography commenced in February 2017 in Agra. Bhoomi trailer was launched on 10 August. The film was released worldwide on 22 September 2017. Plot Bhoomi Sachdeva, a planner and designer, is all set to be married to Neeraj Mathur, her best friend, but has a problem of returning home late from work. Her father Arun Sachdeva is an alcoholic shoe-maker who sells shoes, but she still loves him, as he has a knack of winning over her every time by showering a father's love. Meanwhile, preparations for Bhoomi's wedding with Neeraj come closer, but Vishal Munshi, the son of a middle-aged lady, who is deeply infatuated with Bhoomi, is not happy about it. Despite her warnings, Vishal stalks her, much to her chagrin, and she slaps him back when he tries to force-assert his love, admitting that he is only her friend. Bhoomi goes back to Neeraj, and begins preparing for her big day. In the meantime, Vishal attends to his cousin brother Dedha where he meets the latter's boss Dhauli, a gangster. Dhauli chides Vishal for his cowardice and convinces him to do something about it. One day before the wedding, however, while travelling back home with her aide Jeetu, Bhoomi gets kidnapped as Jeetu takes a small break out there in a bush. Later, as she regains consciousness, she finds Vishal asphyxiating her to near death in Bhagwan Talkies. Vishal, Dedha, and Dhauli take turns in raping Bhoomi, and she falls unconscious. On the day of the wedding, when Neeraj tries to meet Bhoomi, he is shocked to learn of the harsh reality, and is forced against his will to walk back and cancel the marriage, following which, Arun and his childhood friend, Tripurari \\"Taj\\" Mishra come to know of Bhoomi's condition, and visit a local police station. Arun loses control of his temper when the officer-in-charge ignores his complaint while watching a cricket match. The police officer finally registers his complaint, and goes with him to his house, where they find Bhoomi missing. At this stage, Bhoomi is kidnapped again by Vishal, Dhauli and Dedha. This time, Dhauli throws her down a river and shoots the water so that she can't escape. However, Dhauli soon gets a phone call from an anonymous person, from who he comes to know that Bhoomi is alive. Arun, shattered by the entire scene, tries to shower his love on Bhoomi, who is unconscious on a hospital bed. A court case happens, where Arun accuses the defense lawyer of being patriarchal in her approach and body-shaming Bhoomi, while the case is dismissed after they let go of Dhauli, who warns them he will strike again. When confronted, however, both of them break down, bringing them closer to each other. Arun and Bhoomi are shamed. Bhoomi is further shamed in the society when some people write her phone number on the walls. Neeraj returns, trying to pacify her, but she asks him if he can clean the wall and erase her number from the wall. Neeraj is overcome by remorse, but cannot pacify her. The next day, Jeetu's family members visit Bhoomi's house and say that they want to show her something. They show a video from Jeetu's phone in which Jeetu rapes Bhoomi at Bhagwan Talkies. A shocking revealation is made that Jeetu was helping Dhauli all along. Jeetu had taken a break purposefully so that Bhoomi could be kidnapped, and the anonymous caller was none other than Jeetu. Arun and Bhoomi turn ruthless and abduct Jeetu, hiding him from everyone. Jeetu is tortured at a formidable scale. Arun then goes on a scaring spree by haunting Vishal, following him everywhere. One day, Dhauli takes a petrified Vishal to Arun, asking the former to apologize to the latter, but Arun is rather adamant and picks up a fight with Dhauli, who leaves after police intervention. On his 18th birthday, Jeetu is killed by Arun and his body is found in Bhagwan Talkies, where the police officer who had earlier registered Arun's complaint is amazed to see Jeetu's sister disclaiming responsibility and chiding herself for having been his sister. Soon, the police officer gives Arun Arun's keychain that he had been holding when the complaint had been registered, and the policeman says that one mustn't leave his belongings after the match is played. This implies that the policeman knew the truth of the murderer, but he was on Arun's side. A few days later, Dedha comes and tries to assault Bhoomi, but Taj intervenes. However, he crashes into an iron pole and dies from his injuries. Shattered by the loss of his friend, Arun decides to finish off Vishal, Dedha and Dhauli. Vishal, scared off with Jeetu's murder, boards an intercity bus which would lead him back to Dhauli's area, but Arun and Bhoomi confront Vishal and finally force Vishal to castrate himself. Arun drives the bus, which has Bhoomi and a dead Vishal, to Dhauli's area. After a long scuffle, Dedha dies from his injuries. Dhauli tries to escape through a procession of women, but Arun and Bhoomi chase him to a temple, where Arun kills him, and he falls into a water pond out of injuries, unable to make an exit from the pond, and breathes his last as the women in the procession let go of their chunnis, along with Bhoomi's own. Bhoomi and Arun look down at the pond having succeeded in their mission. Cast *Sanjay Dutt as Arun Sachdeva a.k.a.

Count of Meigueil, by right of his wife (jure uxoris). Seigneur of Al√®s (as Bernard II d‚ÄôAl√®s). Bernard became Count of Meigueil upon his marriage to Beatrix de Melgueil, in 1146. One source claims Bernard was in the First Crusade, but there is no evidence that this was the case. Beatrix (1130-1190), also known as Beatrice, was the only child of Bernard IV, Count of Melgueil (d. 1132), and Guillemette de Montpellier (daughter of William V, Lord of Montpellier). Bernard IV inherited the countship from his father Raymond II, representing a lineage of Counts of Melgueil dating to 930. Beatrix became Countess of Melgueil in 1130 upon her father‚Äôs death. Because of her young age, William VI of Montpellier, the son of William V, was named regent of the county and remained so until Beatrix married her first husband Berengar Raymond, Count of Provence. Upon his death in 1144, Beatrix ruled the county. Beatrix then married Bernard II d‚ÄôAl√®s, who became Bernard V, Count of Meigueil. Beatrix and Bernard had two children: * Bertrand Pilet (d. 1191 or after) * Ermessende of Pilet (d. 1176). This is where things become complicated in the ruling of the County of Meigueil. Bertrand was disinherited by his mother and unsuccessfully fought the arrangements made with the Counts of Toulouse by his sister. He swore homage to King Alfonso II of Aragon to help contest these arrangements to no avail. Bertrand married a woman named Bonafosse (d. 1205) of an unknown family and had one child Raymond (d. 1129). Raymond swore allegiance to his brother-in-law Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse, undoubtedly to help regain his inheritance. He married Sibylle d‚ÄôAnduze, daughter of Bernard VII, Seigneur d‚ÄôAnduze. Ermenssende of Pilet married first Pierre Bermond IV, Seigneur of Sauve and Sommi√®res. Her second marriage was to Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse, son of Raymond V of Toulouse and Constance of France, daughter of Louis VI of France. The counts of Toulouse ruled Melgueil until 1211 when Pope Innocent III enfeoffed it to Guillaume d'Autignac, Bishop of Maguelone.

The ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that the stones represented supernatural entities for the circle's builders. Many monuments were built in Exmoor during the Bronze Age, but only two stone circles survive in this area: the other is Porlock Stone Circle. The Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of heathland. It is about 36.4 metres (119 feet 5 inches) in diameter. Around thirty small gritstones remain, although there may originally have been around 100; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and surveyed by the archaeologist Harold St George Gray in 1905. Location Withypool Stone Circle is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill; some sources refer to it as Withypool Hill Stone Circle. The site is 381 metres (1250 feet) above sea level. It is 670 metres (733 yards) east of Portford Bridge, and 4.4 kilometres (2.75 miles) south/south-west of Exford. The site slopes down from east to west. The topsoil is peaty with heather. A range of different Bronze Age round barrows, a type of tumulus, are visible at different points in the surrounding landscape. There is a lone tumulus 262 metres (286 yards) to the north-east of the circle, on the summit of Withypool Hill, although this is so eroded that it can no longer be seen from Withypool Stone Circle itself. The three Brightworthy Barrows can be seen from the circle in a north-west direction. Other Bronze Age barrows visible from the circle are the Green Barrow, the Old Barrow, the Twitchen Barrows, the three Wam Barrows of Winsford Hill, and the barrow on top of Sherdon. Also visible from the circle is a scatter of over thirty stones on the Westwater Allotment; these are up to 0.5 m (1.6 feet) long and in 1988 two were reported as being standing. Elsewhere on Withypool Common is a collection of six stones arranged in a rough circle, which may have represented another stone circle or perhaps the kerbstones from a since-destroyed round cairn. Context While the transition from the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic in the fourth and third millennia BCE saw much economic and technological continuity, there was a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in what is now southern and eastern England. By 3000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic were no longer built, and had been replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. Stone circles are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's south-eastern corner. They are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen. The tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2,400 years, from 3300 to 900 BCE, with the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300 BCE. These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation. This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, but may have been deliberately left as \\"silent and empty monuments\\". The archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suggests that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead, and wood with the living. Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities. Stone circles in Exmoor There are only two known prehistoric stone circles on Exmoor: Withypool and Porlock Stone Circle. The archaeologist Leslie Grinsell suggested that the circular stone monument on Almsworthy Common was \\"probably\\" the remains of a stone circle, although more recent assessments regard it one of the stone settings, a different form of monument which is more common across Exmoor. Withypool Stone Circle in its landscape context, 2014 Archaeologists have dated these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, and have noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, on Dartmoor. In contrast to the two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor. This scarcity of large stones may explain why Neolithic and Bronze Age communities used small stones, termed miniliths, in the two Exmoor circles and in other monuments within the region. There are nevertheless other constructions in the area, such as the clapper bridge at Tarr Steps and the three-metre Long Stone at Challacombe, which do use locally sourced large megaliths. This suggests that larger stones would have been available had the sites' builders desired, and that the use of miniliths was therefore deliberate. Exmoor also has a henge, near Parracombe, although it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, linear stone rows, and stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might also explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here. Most of the surviving prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture. For this reason it is likely that the surviving sites are not a reliable indicator of the original extent of these sites. Description alt=A map of the stone circle. A series of small dark dots mark out the position of the ring. The stone circle measures 36.4 metres (119 feet 6 inches) in diameter. In 1905, there were 37 stones remaining in the circle. At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring; the stones perhaps in these areas may have been removed for use as road metal. There are ground depressions where some of these stones have been removed. In 1915 it was reported that one had been removed but that three additional stones had been found in the circle. By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only 29 stones in the circle. Conversely, the following year the archaeologist Aubrey Burl reported 30 stones, of which three had fallen and 27 remained standing. Originally it may have included around 100 stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 3 inches) apart. The stones themselves are small: on average they measure 10 cm (4 inches) in height, 30 cm (one foot) in width, and 10 cm (4 inches) in depth. The largest protrudes about 0.5 metres (1 foot 8 inches) from the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely have been broken since the original erection of the circle. It is not known if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, but a sample from one stone was examined and found to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones. Investigation The site was accidentally rediscovered in 1898 when Archibald Hamilton was riding across Withypool Heath. His horse stumbled on one of the stones, and on further investigation he located other stones within the bracken. After the bracken on the heath was burned by farmers, Hamilton returned to pay closer attention to the circle. He contacted Colonel Bramble, the Vice President of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, who put him in touch with the archaeologist Harold St George Gray. Gray accompanied Hamilton on a visit to the site in August 1905, when he made a complete survey of the ring. Gray published his findings in a 1906 volume of the Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, in which he drew comparisons between the site and two Cornish stone circles that he had recently surveyed, Fernacre and Stannon Stone Circle. He suggested that the circle had been the site of cremations, the cremated human remains then being buried within the nearby tumuli. In August 1915, Gray returned to the site. He noted that the circle was in largely the same condition as before, but that the ling and whortleberry bushes around the site were more stunted than they had previously been. Between 1982 and 1985, Fowler visited Withypool Stone Circle alongside other prehistoric stone monuments in Exmoor for a catalogue published in a 1988 edition of the Proceedings. The site has been categorised as a scheduled monument since 1925, and is thus accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. In the Historic England database, it is given the listing number of 1021261.

The investigation showed financial irregularities at the company and showed that work was being carried out at a \\"poor standard\\" in west Belfast. In April 2011, the ¬£8 million contract was cancelled after the firm was found to be \\"significantly overcharging\\". Members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) intervened and campaigned for an extension to the Red Sky contract, citing \\"sectarian bias\\" for the contract being cancelled. Jenny Palmer, a DUP councillor, sat on the Housing Executive board. The board was due to discuss a request from the DUP's Minister for Social Development Nelson McCausland to extend Red Sky's contract. She alleged that Stephen Brimstone, McCausland's special adviser, pressured her into changing her vote at the meeting. The Housing Executive chairman said that McCausland's interference into the Housing Executive \\"amounted to an unwarranted and improper interference\\". Background In 2010, a BBC investigation found that there were complaints against the firm Red Sky dating back to 2007. The complaints centred around Red Sky's work in west Belfast being of \\"poor standard\\". In two cases, it was discovered that Red Sky had billed the Housing Executive for work that was never actually completed. In April 2011, the company went into voluntary administration after the Housing Executive had cancelled their contract after an investigation concluded that there were concerns of fraud. DUP intervention Nelson McCausland, the Minister for Social Development, asked the Housing Executive to reinstate Red Sky's contract until such a time where a system for awarding new contracts is introduced. At an emergency meeting of the Housing Executive, the board decided not to overturn its decision. The Housing Executive \\"raised concerns\\" in a letter to its board members about meetings \\"held between McCausland, First Minister of Northern Ireland Peter Robinson and other DUP elected representatives with the former senior management at Red Sky.\\" The executive asked whether the meetings \\"constituted canvassing and lobbying for government contracts in breach of public procurement principles\\". The executive also called McCausland's intervention on the issue \\"incomprehensible\\". A meeting with senior DUP politicians led by Robinson took place with Housing Executive officials. Minutes from the meeting show that Robinson \\"said in his opinion, Housing Executive staff must bear some of the blame for overpayments\\". Brian Rowntree, Housing Executive chairman, wrote a letter following the meeting and told McCausland to \\"step back\\" and threatened legal action against the minister and his department. The DUP believed that Red Sky was 'singled out' because it was a 'Protestant' firm. They claimed \\"sectarian bias\\" on part of the Housing Executive. DUP whistleblower Jenny Palmer sat on the Housing Executive board and alleged that on her way to the Housing Executive board meeting, McCausland's special advisor Stephen Brimstone called her and \\"pressured her\\" into changing her vote at the meeting. Brimstone wanted her to overturn the decision to cancel Red Sky's contract. She made the revelations two years after the board meeting. She alleges that Brimstone told her \\"the party comes first\\". In the subsequent inquiry, Brimstone denied acting inappropriately and said he \\"struggles\\" to remember the conversation. Palmer was later disciplined by the DUP and Brimstone was promoted to special advisor in the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, serving Peter Robinson. Palmer said that the DUP was to give her a public apology for her treatment, which didn't materialise. She said that there had been \\"an effort to keep the sectarian card alive\\" in relation to the board meeting. Committee inquiry The Social Development Committee at the Northern Ireland Assembly held an inquiry into the Spotlight claims. The report concluded that McCausland \\"acted inappropriately\\" by asking for Red Sky's contract to be extended. Sinn F√©in MLA Alex Maskey, deputy chairperson of the committee, said Palmer's evidence was \\"convincing, consistent and compelling\\". The DUP MLAs on the committee, however, disagreed with the report and compiled a minority report which was in favour of McCausland. Their report said he \\"in fact ultimately supported the Housing Executive's decision to proceed with the termination of the contracts\\". At a vote in the Assembly, MLAs voted to \\"note\\" the committee's report and it was passed by 55 votes to 32.

Its tenants include the downtown Los Angeles Macy's store, LA Fitness, Nordstrom Local, UNIQLO and the Sheraton Grand Los Angeles hotel. The plaza has its own access to the LA Metro at the 7th Street/Metro Center station.  History   The Original Broadway Plaza (1973‚Äì2013)  The original Broadway Plaza opened as an enclosed shopping mall in 1973. The structure claimed to be the first enclosed \\"suburban\\" type shopping center in a downtown area in the United States. The original enclosed mall included the downtown The Broadway store, the Hyatt Regency Los Angeles, and an Oshman's Sporting Goods, along with an underground food court and several smaller non-chain shops. The mall was renamed Macy's Plaza in 1996 due to the bankruptcy of The Broadway chain being bought out by Macy's. In 2005, the Hyatt Regency was renamed the Sheraton Los Angeles Downtown. Bally Total Fitness (which occupied the Oshman's space) closed and re-opened as LA Fitness in 2012. In 2013, Macy's Plaza was acquired by Ratkovich, who developed plans to replace the imposing 1973-vintage \\"monolithic\\" red brick fortress-like architectural style, with a more open plan.  Renovation (2015)  A majority of the Macy's Plaza closed in early-2015 for the conversion into a new open-air plaza, given the name The Bloc. The renovation forced many long-time tenants, including Bath and Body Works, Express, Lady Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret, and original 1973 opening tenant Carl's Jr. in the underground food court to close. Many of these tenants, including Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works, moved to the nearby newly-renovated FIGat7th outdoor mall. Macy's and the Sheraton hotel remained open during the renovations. LA Fitness and the United States Postal Service branch at the mall remained operational but were forced to move to street level. In May 2015, the large \\"Macy's\\" sign was taken down and the large glass atrium roof was removed, officially opening the atrium of the once enclosed mall to the sky.  The New Outdoor-Plaza  The Bloc Los Angeles was officially opened in October 2015. By design, the outdoor plaza was the first development in the Los Angeles area to have its own access to the LA Metro (as was planned when the subway line was constructed under Flower Street in 1989). The new plaza will contain Los Angeles' first Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, an Austin-based movie theatre chain, and Starbucks Evenings, a Starbucks store concept that serves alcoholic beverages, along with a Macy's flagship store, GNC, and LA Fitness. Other restaurants include Hatch, Urban Oven, CoffeeWalk YogurTalk, Everytable and District DTLA. In 2016, following a renovation, the Sheraton Los Angeles Downtown was renamed the Sheraton Grand Los Angeles. Due to delays in construction, The Bloc for a while had trouble finding tenants, but once Alamo Drafthouse officially signed their lease, more tenants started signing leases. The Bloc now has 60 percent of the office spaces leased and 76 percent of the retail space leased. In 2018, a retailer Uniqlo opens it store in Downtown LA.

Sheffield Wednesday Burton joined Sheffield Wednesday prior to the start of the 1902/03 season, from Attercliffe, but did not make an appearance for the first team that season, with Sheffield Wednesday going on to win the League in the 1902‚Äì03 season. Despite being born in West Bromwich Burton lived in the Sheffield area from the age of four, playing football for Huntman's Garden School, Chippingham and Attercliffe prior to signing for Sheffield Wednesday. In Burton's early career at Sheffield Wednesday he was described as a left-back who was \\"well built and clever\\" and competed for the left-back position with Ambrose Langley, who he eventually overtook as first choice in 1903. As a footballer with Sheffield Wednesday Burton won the Midland League, Wharncliffe Charity Cup, Sheffield Challenge Cup a Sheffield Charity match medal and a Sheriff of London (Dewar) Charity medal also winning major honours when the team retained the League title in the 1903‚Äì04 season and he also played in the victorious 1907 FA Cup final. West Brom As proven by newspaper reports from the time, in March 1909 Burton was unexpectedly transferred to West Brom, in a double transfer involving teammate George Simpson. Newspapers and fans alike were shocked by the sudden departure, which \\"came as a surprise to the great majority of Sheffield Wednesday supporters.\\" The transfer was described as a \\"sensation\\", \\"sensational news\\" as \\"Burton was regarded as a permanent fixture at Owlerton\\". So loved was Burton at Sheffield Wednesday that in preseason in August 1909 he was reported as enjoying a night with his former Sheffield Wednesday team at Sheffield Hippodrome, despite being a West Brom player. Burton never quite replicated his form whilst at West Brom and by May 1911 had taken to placing advertisements in Athletic News seeking employment as a player or player manager. Scunthorpe United After making efforts to find a new club following an unsuccessful time at West Brom in October 1912 Burton transferred to Scunthorpe United, his first appearance for them coming against Mexborough Town in the Midland League. International Burton never made a single international appearance, despite being a regular in a Sheffield Wednesday team that won major honours, though it was reported that he \\"more than once must have verged on (becoming an) international\\". Family Census records show that in 1901 Harry was boarding with the Darlow family on Staniforth Road in Attercliffe, where he was employed as a printer. In 1907 he married Florrie, also of Attercliffe, and the 1911 census records them living at 50 Hope Street, West Bromwich, where he was still a professional footballer. Following retirement, Harry worked for Messrs John Brown and Co Ltd, a mill, who along with representatives of his former football clubs attended his funeral in Tinsley, Sheffield, in August 1923.

Barack Obama's farewell address was the final public speech of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States, delivered on January 10, 2017 at 9:00 p.m. EST. The farewell address was broadcast on various television and radio stations and livestreamed online by the White House. An estimated 24 million people watched the address live on television. The speech and its transcript are available on the archived version of the Obama White House website. Background Obama served as the first African American President of the United States for two terms, first elected in 2008 and reelected in 2012. During his presidency, his administration addressed the 2007-2008 global financial crisis (including a major stimulus package), oversaw the passage and implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, partially extended Bush tax cuts, took executive action on immigration reform, and took steps to combat climate change and carbon emissions. Obama also authorized the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, signed the New START treaty with Russia, signed the Paris Agreement, and negotiated rapprochements with Iran and Cuba. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress until Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. Republicans took control of the Senate after the 2014 elections, and Obama continued to grapple with Congressional Republicans over government spending, immigration, judicial nominations, and other issues. In the 2016 presidential election, Obama was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the restrictions of the Twenty-second Amendment. In June 2016, Obama endorsed his former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, to succeed him as president. He addressed the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 27 in support of Clinton as the Democratic Party's nominee, and continued to campaign for her throughout the 2016 general election campaign season. However, Hillary Clinton would unexpectedly lose the general election to Republican nominee Donald Trump on November 8, after failing to receive enough votes in the Electoral College, despite receiving a plurality of the national popular vote. The Democratic Party would no longer control the presidency once Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017, and they did not have a majority of seats in either chamber of the United States Congress, and in the state legislatures and governorships. President Obama's approval ratings were nearly at 60 percent at the time of his farewell speech. Venue In a break with recent tradition, President Obama did not deliver his farewell address at the White House. Instead, he gave the speech at the McCormick Place convention center in his home city of Chicago, less than four miles from Grant Park, where he delivered his 2008 election victory speech. McCormick Place is also the same venue where Obama delivered his 2012 reelection victory speech. The event was open to the public, with free tickets being distributed on a first-come, first-served basis on January 7. Composition Keenan checks Obama's farewell address one last time aboard Air Force One en route to Chicago On January 2, 2017, President Obama released a post on the White House blog publicly announcing that he would deliver his farewell address in his hometown of Chicago, and stated that he was \\"just beginning\\" to write his remarks and that he was \\"thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you've changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.\\" In the January 6th press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that \\"the President is interested in delivering a farewell address that's forward-looking\\" and on January 9 he stated that \\"there's still a lot of work that needs to be done on the speech. So the President will be doing a lot of thinking between now and then, between now and 9:00 p.m. Eastern tomorrow, thinking about what he wants to say and what sort of presentation he wants to make to the American public as he enters the last couple of weeks that he has here at the White House.\\" The farewell address was written by President Obama, who dictated passages to Cody Keenan, the White House Director of Speechwriting. The President and Keenan went through at least four drafts of the speech. Former White House speechwriter Jon Favreau and former senior advisor David Axelrod also contributed to the drafting process.

Biography Thorneycroft was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Thorneycroft, JP, a former High Sheriff of Staffordshire, by his wife Jane Whitelaw. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Scots Fusiliers on 22 February 1879, and served in the Anglo-Zulu War later the same year, followed by the operations against Sekukuni. Two years later, he served in the First Boer War of 1881, and took part in the defence of Pretoria, following which he was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1881. He was promoted to captain on 23 January 1887, to major on 1 July 1899, and received the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel on the same day.Hart¬¥s Army list, 1901 Expecting military hostilities, Thorneycroft was one of several officers sent to South Africa to raise volunteer units shortly before the Second Boer War broke out in October 1899. He raised a corps of troopers, later known as the Thorneycroft‚Ä≤s Mounted Infantry, which served in the early stages of the war, including in the campaign to relieve Ladysmith, which was under siege by troops from the Boer republics. In the Battle of Spion Kop in late January 1900, he was selected to lead the initial assault. Before dawn, the British forces had captured what they thought was the summit of the kop, or hill. The Boers, who actually held the higher ground, soon counter-attacked, swarming the British position, and the higher ranking British officers were killed or mortally wounded, leaving Thorneycroft the most senior officer present. A British counterattack failed in the face of withering fire from the Boers, but Thorneycroft refused to allow any under his command to surrender. Not knowing that they actually had gained the upper hand over the course of the day, and running short on both water and ammunition, the British troops retreated under cover of dark. The battle at Spion Kop was considered a resounding defeat, but the British regrouped and was able to relieve Ladysmith four weeks later. Thorneycroft received a brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the April 1901 South Africa Honours list (the award was dated 29 November 1900). He stayed in South Africa throughout the war, which entered a phase of guerrilla warfare from late 1900. In his final despatch from South Africa in June 1902, Lord Kitchener, Commander-in-Chief of the forces during the latter part of the war, described Thorneycroft as \\"an absolutely reliable officer of great experience, common- sense and force of character.\\" For his service in the later part of the war, Thorneycroft received a brevet promotion to colonel on 22 August 1902. After the end of the war in June 1902, Thorneycroft was among a number of officers who left Cape Town in the SS Kildonan Castle in late July, arriving in Southampton the following month. Following his return, he was appointed assistant adjutant-general of the 7th Infantry Division, serving in Dublin, in November 1902. He then became Commander of 14th Infantry Brigade in November 1905 and General Officer Commanding South Midland Division in September 1911 before retiring in July 1912.

When the Nazis took power at the start of 1933 he campaigned for several weeks against fascism and war. Following his arrest he survived more than eleven of the twelve Nazi years in state captivity, but was shot dead at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp by Nazi paramilitaries (SS) a few months before the end of the Second World War. Life Augustin \\"Gustl\\" Sandtner was born in Munich. His father worked as a marble cutter/grinder. \\"Gustl\\" trained for work in a bakery. In 1911 he became an organiser in the \\"Bakers and Pastry Makers Trades Union\\". In 1912 he was conscripted to undertake his military service in the Imperial German Navy. During World War I he joined the \\"International Group\\" and the \\"Spartacus League\\" which grew out of it. As a member of the crew on the Battlecruiser SMS Seydlitz he organised (illegal) revolutionary groups and distributed anti-war literature. On 3 November 1918 he participated in the Kiel mutiny which triggered a year of insurrections across Germany. A few days later he led a delegation of the Kiel sailors south to Munich where he was elected a member of the Soldiers' and Workers' Council. During this period Sandtner became a member of the leadership of the Spartacus League, which over the final days of 1918 was reconfigured, renamed and relaunched, now the core of the new Communist Party of Germany. Sandtner was a member from the outset. As a member of the so-called Bavarian \\"Red army\\" during the short lived Bavarian Soviet Republic of April/May 1919, after the movement was crushed by a combination of still loyal government forces and \\"Freikorps\\" anti-communist volunteer units Sandtner found himself imprisoned at the end of May and threatened with execution. However, the government was keen not to encourage political extremists unnecessarily: many of those involved in the Munich insurrection received amnesties: Sandtner was released at the end of 1919. During 1920 and 1921 he was a member of the Communist Party regional leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for south Bavaria. It was here that he met Hanna Ritter whom he would later marry. He was elected chair of the workers' council at BMW. In 1922 he was sentenced to three and a half years' imprisonment because of his involvement in organising solidarity support for the Communist led insurrections in central Germany in March of the previous year. After his release he moved to Berlin where he became a full-time party official in the city's Wedding and Moabit quarters. In 1926 he was re-arrested and taken into investigative custody because of \\"anti-militarism work among members of the national army\\". However, after a relatively brief period of detention he was amnestied, possibly in response to pressure applied by comrades locally, and released. He took over as head of the \\"State emigration department\\" (\\"Reichsemigrantenabteilung\\") of the party central committee. Sandtner next became local policy chief (\\"Polleiter\\") for several local party sub-districts including the northern part of the Berlin-Brandenburg district. His focus switched away from Berlin when he became policy chief (\\"Polleiter\\") for the party leadership team in Silesia. Two months later, following the regional election in April 1932, he was elected a member of the Prussian parliament (\\"Landtag\\"). The political backdrop changed with the Nazi take-over in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire at the end of February 1933 was immediately blamed on \\"communists\\", and it was indeed those members (and former members) of the Communist Party who had not already gone into hiding or fled abroad who found themselves heading the government's political targets list. Augustin Sandtner spent the first part of 1933 in the border regions of Silesia organising joint rallies by Germany, Polish and Czechoslovakian workers opposed to fascism and the looming risks of war. On 7 February 1933 Sandtner was one of the participants at the \\"illegal\\" Sporthaus Ziegenhals meeting, celebrated subsequently (especially during the \\"East German\\" years) as the last meeting held by the German Communist Party leadership before the participants were arrested and killed, or in a few cases managed to flee abroad. Augustin Sandtner was arrested in Breslau on 27 April 1933. In January 1934 he was sentenced to a three year prison term. At the end of the three year term he was transferred to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Death Inside the concentration camp, as a leader of the illegal Communist Party organisation among the prisoners, working closely with members of resistance groups from other nations, he played a significant part in organising the anti-fascist struggle. After more than eleven years in detention, and still at Sachsenhausen, August Sandtner was one of 24 German camp inmates deemed culpable of \\"illegal activities\\" taken out, together with three French antifascists, and shot dead by Nazi paramilitaries (SS) on 11 October 1944. Others killed included Ernst Schneller and . Celebration Some of the streets named after \\"communist heroes\\" in the days of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) were renamed following German reunification in 1990. However, Augustin Sandtner is still (2017) commemorated on the Berlin street map by Augustin-Sandtner-Stra√üe in the city's Oranienburg quarter. There is also a Gustl-Sandtner-Stra√üe in Teltow on Berlin's southern edge.. During the East German period an army engineering regiment, the Ingenieurbauregiment 2 Augustin Sandtner, specialising in construction-engineering (including the building of large scale nuclear bunkers such as strategic command posts) was also named after Augustin Sandtner. The unit was also known by the unit designation IBR 2. In NVA nomenclature IBR was shorthand for Ingenieurbauregiment (Engineer Construction Regiment).

It protects an area of restinga, dense rainforest and land modified by exotic plantations which is to be restored. The park provides a green space for visitors from the nearby state capital of Florian√≥polis. It features an ecological trail where visitors may see and learn about wild animals rescued from abuse by the environmental police. Location The Rio Vermelho State Park is located on the east coast of Santa Catarina Island, in the municipality of Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina. It is bounded by the district of S√£o Jo√£o do Rio Vermelho to the north, Lagoa da Concei√ß√£o to the west, Mo√ßambique beach to the east and the district of Barra da Lagoa to the south. It has an area of . Highway SC-406 cuts through the park. The park holds one of the oldest sambaquis of the island, about 5,020 years old. The park holds the Ingleses-Rio Vermelho aquifer, which supplies water to the north of Santa Catarina Island, and ensures that the water of the aquifer is plentiful and uncontaminated. A large part of the Mo√ßambique beach is inside the park, the largest beach in Florian√≥polis. History The area now covered by the park was made a Forest Station in 1962 with the goal of finding through experiment the species best able to grow and protect the dunes of the sea coast, and also to provide a green space for the population. Species of pine such as Pinus elliottii and eucalyptus from different parts of the world were planted over a twelve-year period, as well as casuarina, acacias and other exotic species. It is now known that these are all more or less invasive, particularly the pines, and studies are being made on how best to remove all the exotic species and restore the park. The pine and eucalyptus wood will be sold. The Rio Vermelho State Park was created by state decree 308 of 24 May 2007. The objective is to conserve samples of dense rainforest and restinga vegetation, to conserve the associated fauna, to maintain balance in the region's water complex, to restore the ecosystem and to support scientific research and public visits. Environment The park contains 11% dense rainforest of the Atlantic Forest biome (in the Morro dos Macacos), 54% restinga with different heights and species, and 35% ecosystems altered by plantation and invasions of pine and eucalyptus trees. 169 native plant species have been identified, associated with three types of restinga: herbaceous (66 species), shrub (14 species) and arboreal (100 species). The thorny climbing shrub Mimosa catharinensis Burkart was discovered in the area in 1964. It has not been found anywhere else in the world. There are 23 species of mammals on the island, almost all of which may be present in the park. Researchers from the Federal University of Santa Catarina have found the footprints of big-eared opossum (Didelphis aurita) and crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous). The black capuchin (Sapajus nigritus) is found in the park and gives its name to the Morro dos Macacos (Monkey Hill). 106 species of birds and 15 species of reptiles have been recorded. The skull tree iguana (Liolaemus occipitalis) is a rare, endangered species that lives only in the coastal dunes of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Visiting Flooded area The Rio Vermelho State Park is open to the public from Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00 to 17:00 p.m. The park includes a camping site with 600 spaces, 24 hour security, toilets with hot showers, barbecue grills, restaurant service, laundry and other facilities. From the campsite there is a trail to the beach and another trail of through the forest, with vegetation that includes pines and fragments of Atlantic Forest. The Lagoa da Concei√ß√£o terminal is from the campsite, with boat transport to the Costa da Lagoa, a traditional community with restaurants and a waterfall. A ecological trail was opened on World Environment Day, 5 June 2014. It has 16 nurseries holding about 150 wild animals, victims of ill-treatment that had been seized by the environmental police, including monkeys, hawks, macaws and parrots. Admission is free, and the trail has wooden decks to make it accessible to people with difficulty walking. Guided tours are given on the Rio Vermelho Trail, with the guide giving information about the animals and the park. Groups of up to 30 leave every 20 or 30 minutes, with a total of 650 per day. This is considered the maximum to avoid excessive stress on the fauna. The trail has a belvedere looking over the lagoon and flora of the park with toilets and a water fountain.

Life Tapper was born at Enkhuizen, County of Holland, on 15 February 1487. He matriculated at Leuven University on 11 June 1503, and graduated M.A. in 1507. While studying Theology he taught physics and logic. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1515, and graduated Licentiate of Sacred Theology on 3 June 1516 and Doctor of Sacred Theology on 16 August 1519. On 21 November 1519 Tapper succeeded Martinus Dorpius as president of Holy Spirit College in Leuven. In 1535 he became dean of St. Peter's Church, Leuven, and chancellor of the university.Peter G. Bietenholz and Thomas Brian Deutscher (eds.), Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register, vols. 1-3 (University of Toronto Press, 2003), 308-309. Tapper was also the senior representative of the Inquisition of the Netherlands in Leuven where he acquired a particularly bad name as a cruel inquisitor, noted for a blind fanaticism and clever eloquence particularly suited to this spiteful office.Jacob Cornelis van Slee, \\"Tapper, Ruard\\", in Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, vol. 37 (1894), 396. Accessed 3 January 2018. An early history of the Reformation quotes him as follows: > It is no great matter whether those that die on this account be guilty or > innocent, provided we terrify the people by these examples; which generally > succeeds best, when persons eminent for learning, riches, nobility or high > stations, are thus sacrificed. Tapper was well respected by the Habsburg Emperor Charles V, who sent him to represent the Low Countries at the Council of Trent in 1551. After 1555, the successor of Charles, Phillip II, was not at all well disposed to him and he went into decline, dying in Brussels on 2 March 1559. He was buried in St Peter's church, Leuven.

Background The Irish Troubles broke out in August 1969 after the Battle of the Bogside and the Belfast August 1969 riots. Soon after the British Army was called in to restore order but events quickly shaped the conflict into a three-way urban guerrilla war with Loyalist paramilitaries like the Ulster Volunteer Force on one side, Irish Republican paramilitaries like the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on one side and the British state security services making up the other belligerent. The killings in Newry on 23 October 1971 was one in a series of controversial incidents between 1970‚Äì1973 that involved the British Army shooting and killing Catholic Irish Nationalist civilians. During the Falls Curfew of July 1970 the British Army killed four Catholic civilians, the next year in August 1971 (when internment was being introduced) during the Ballymurphy Massacre they shot dead eleven civilians including a Catholic priest and a 50-year-old mother of eight. The most famous of these incidents was Bloody Sunday in January 1972 in which British paratroopers shot dead 14 civil rights protesters, later on that same year British army snipers shot dead five civilians and injured two more Catholic civilians in an event known as the Springhill massacre. The shooting The shooting happened when the undercover British soldiers who were in an observation post on the roof of a Woolworths store believed they saw a robbery taking place at a bank across the street and assumed the robbers were members of the IRA. Sean Ruddy (19), Robert Anderson (25) and Thomas McLoughlin (27) were all shot dead. The British Army said that it had received information that the Provisional IRA was going to launch an operation in the area. None of those killed were members of any paramilitary group and local eyewitnesses claim that the men were just having an argument with someone inside the bank, not robbing it, and that the army simply shot the three men without the men posing any serious risk to the soldiers or anybody else in the area. The shootings were carried out by the British Army‚Äôs Royal Green Jackets. In 2011 the Northern Ireland Historical Enquiries Team (HET) released its four-year investigation into the shooting. The HET report concluded that the killings were \\"a tragedy that should not have happened\\". The report found there to be a \\"question mark\\" over the British Army's conduct. Arthur Ruddy, brother of Sean Ruddy and a former nationalist councillor, said the four-year-long investigation by the Historical Enquiries Team had vindicated the family, who always maintained the 19-year-old's killing was unlawful. There was intense rioting by the nationalist community in Newry for several days after the killing of the three men, with people directing their anger towards soldiers by throwing stones and, in some cases, petrol bombs at them. During the funerals of the men killed, most shops in the town closed out of respect to the dead men - except for the bank where the men had been shot, and the local post office. Both of these had their windows broken by youths throwing stones through them. After this there were further clashes with locals and the army, with the army firing CS gas and baton rounds at the mourners.The Troubles 7, by Joe Baker - issuuEamon Collins (1997) - Killing Rage pp, 44-45  See also  *Bloody Sunday, 1972 *Falls Curfew *List of massacres in Ireland *Operation Demetrius *Springhill massacre References 1971 murders in the United Kingdom Conflicts in 1971 1971 in Northern Ireland Newry Massacres in Northern Ireland Massacres committed by the United Kingdom British Army in Operation Banner Military scandals Mass murder in 1971 Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland Military actions and engagements during the Troubles (Northern Ireland) Terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom in 1971 The Troubles in Belfast Terrorism deaths in Northern Ireland October 1971 events in the United Kingdom Terrorist incidents in Northern Ireland Terrorism committed by the United Kingdom People killed by security forces during The Troubles (Northern Ireland) ","title":"1971 Newry killings"},{"id":"52943597","text":"John T. and Mary M.

It was founded in 1726 and disappeared in 1745.  History  Three Capuchin missionaries arrived Lhasa in 1708 and were later joined by another two missionaries the next year. The missionaries spent the next few years studying the Tibetan language and providing medical services to the locals. However, in 1712 they returned back to Europe as they were suffering from illness, a lack of funds and faced hostility from the Gelugpa order. Italian Capuchin priests Francesco della Penna and Domenico da Fano arrived in Lhasa in 1719 with some Capuchin friars. This was followed by a contest of competition with the Jesuit missionary Ippolito Desideri, the Holy See decided in 1721 in favor of the Capuchins who had already obtained the authorization of the Tibetan authorities to build a chapel. Kelzang Gyatso, the seventh Dalai Lama, authorized the construction of the church on the heights of the city in 1726.Gilles van Grasdorff, √Ä la d√©couverte de l‚ÄôAsie avec les Missions √©trang√®res, Omnibus, juin 2008 (), p. 666 The superior of the mission, Francesco della Penna, returned to Rome in 1737, when Pope Benedict XIV gave a letter to the seventh Dalai Lama, and he took the road to Tibet. The mission soon began making converts which was met with hostility from the Gelugpa Lamas. Hundreds of Lamas appealed to the Lhasa government to banish the European missionaries. The appeal was successful and all missionaries forcefully left Lhasa by 1745. The church was subsequently destroyed. The mission had little success converting any Tibetans and most converts were foreign Nepalis, Kasmiris and Han Chinese who resided in Lhasa. However, the mission had up to 26 Tibetan converts near the end of its existence.

With the patronage of Vilem√≠na knƒõ≈æna z Auerspergu (1826-1898), he began taking lessons from Franti≈°ek Sequens and Maximilian Pirner at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, continued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich with Alexander von Wagner, then worked as a painter and art teacher in Plze≈à. His painting \\"Hopeless Love\\" won a major award at the General Land Centennial Exhibition in 1891. It also earned him a one-year scholarship to study in Paris where he worked with Vojtƒõch Hynais, who had created the curtain for the Prague National Theater. In 1900, as a result of this experience, he was commissioned to create a curtain for the new Josef Kajet√°n Tyl Theatre. At about the same time, he painted lunettes at the recently completed . He also created monumental paintings for the Higher Economic School, now a satellite institute of Charles University. From 1907 to 1925, he was a teacher at the girls' lyceum. He is best known as a regionalist, focusing on costumes and village life from the surrounding areas.

History  It was founded in 1865 by F√©lix Biet and Auguste Desgodins, French missionaries of the Foreign Missions of Paris. The mission was based in Xinjiang but some of its missionaries opted to proselytize in Tibet. Within a few years, Tibetan marauders supported by Buddhist lamas killed 10 priests and destroyed all but one Catholic mission which was based in Yanjing. Bringing with them thirty-five of their faithful, having been expelled from the main mission of Bonga in Yerkalo, conquered by the Chinese empire, were legally established in some plots of land with the complicity of the population and silence of local leaders . Historically, China and Tibet disputed the possession of the Yerkalo saline wells, which passed from one side or the other of the Sino-Tibetan border. Finally, in 1932, the village was placed under the administration of the Lhasa government. According to the Xinhua news agency, the establishment of a small Catholic parish in Tibet was not an easy task. Frequent clashes took place between Catholics and nearby groups, culminating in the death of one of Father Biet's successors, Father Maurice Tornay in 1949.

It owns 18 brands. Its principal brand was Smith & Wesson firearms up until the company was spun out in 2020. The decision to split off firearm business was partly motivated by changing Political climate. History On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corporation from Tomkins plc for US$15 million. Saf-T- Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million. Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith & Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement. On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation. Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation announced in December 2014 that it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies, a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. The company made the acquisition with the eventual intent to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P; and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division. In August 2016, Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million and Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November of that same year, the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. The company had diversified from firearms into sporting goods and outdoor gear, the rugged outdoors business being a larger market than firearms, in hopes of insulating Smith & Wesson from the stock price volatility caused by the unpredictability of the gun business. This culminated in the decision to change the company's name, and on November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation announced that it would change its name to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. The name change took effect on the first business day of 2017. The change occurred at a time when the firearms industry was receiving backlash over gun violence in America, and so was also seen as an attempt to disassociate itself from the negative repercussions surrounding the issue. In 2017, firearms accounted for 86% of American Outdoor Brands's revenues, and the company shipped 420,000 long guns. American Outdoor Brands also owns Battenfeld Technologies, Taylor Brands (a knife and tool maker bought in August 2016 for $95 million), and Crimson Trace (an electro-optics business which it bought in August 2016 for $85 million). On November 13, 2019, American Outdoor Brands Corp. said it would split into two companies: Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc., which would retain gun sales, and American Outdoor Brands, Inc. The transaction was expected to be finalized in the second half of 2020. The company cited changes in political climate and economic, investing and insurance markets. In January 2020, American Outdoor Brands replaced CEO P. James Debney following allegations of misconduct. The company named Mark Smith and Brian Murphy as joint CEOs. On 24 August 2020, the company was spun-off from Smith & Wesson, with S&W; retaining the original stock ticker SWBI and American Outdoor Brands becoming a new publicly-traded company on the NASDAQ as American Outdoor Brands, Inc.

She founded and served as first president of the North Texas Female College (renamed Kidd-Key College), of Sherman, Texas, the first woman south of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line to hold such a position. Early years and education Lucy Ann Thornton was born at Bardstown, Kentucky, November 15, 1839 (another source states June 11, 1839), daughter of Willis Strather and Esther (Stevens) Thornton; granddaughter of James Thornton, of Kentucky, and great- granddaughter of Sir William Thornton, of Virginia. On the maternal side she was of South Carolina Huguenot ancestry. There was a sister, Sarah (born 1836), who married Dr. W. Y. Gadberry. For the most part, her education was acquired at Rev. Stuart Robinson's Institute at Georgetown, Kentucky, where she specialized in literature and history. Career About 1858, at age 17, she married Dr. Henry Byrd Kidd (1821‚Äì1877) of Kentucky, a physician-planter, and took up her residence on an extensive plantation near Yazoo City, Mississippi. Her sister and brother-in-law moved to Yazoo as well. The American Civil War brought ruin and disaster to her husband. At his death in 1877, after a long period of invalidism, he left many debts, and three small children. She took up the management of the debts, and eventually paid them off. She accepted the position of presiding teacher at Whitworth College (now Whitworth University), Brookhaven, Mississippi, and remained there 10 years. In 1888, she became president of the North Texas Female College (now Kidd-Key College), Sherman, Texas. This institution had fallen into disrepute, and had been closed for two years. The buildings were in a dilapidated condition, and but partly finished. With a valuation on the property of US$15,000 it was encumbered with a debt of US$11,000. She reopened the college with 60 boarders and an enrollment of nearly 100 students.

Agile Scrum is based on the concept of working iteratively in short sprints, typically two weeks long, where the requirements and development are continuously being improved. The Fibonacci sequence consists of numbers that are the summation of the two preceding numbers, starting with [0, 1]. Agile uses the Fibonacci sequence to achieve better results by reducing complexity, effort, and doubt when determining the development time required for a task, which can range from a few minutes to several weeks.  Procedure  It is easier to determine the relative complexity of a task rather than figuring out how much time it requires. Due to this, when working with agile, a revised Fibonacci scale is used in terms of points to estimate the work, as opposed to the traditional measurement of time. In one method commonly used to calculate the size of stories in points, a process like the game of Planning Poker, the following process is used: # The Product Owner sits down with the team to estimate the user stories. # Each member estimates a number on the Fibonacci scale that he/she believes represents the size of the task. # All members disclose their number at the same time (to avoid being influenced by each other's estimates). # Any differences in the numbers will be followed by a discussion until a consensus is reached. # Each user story is added to a bucket which represents the corresponding point on the Fibonacci scale. # The steps above are repeated for all user stories. # The buckets are added to the backlog. Giving each member the opportunity to think individually reduces pressure and may result in a more accurate representation of the feature‚Äôs size. In another commonly used method, a process like the game of Two Pass Relative Sizing, also known as the Steve Bockman Method and the Team Estimation Game, the following process is used: # The product manager sits down with the team to estimate a project's worth of user stories, which are provided to the team in a stack of 3x5 or 4x6 cards. # The first team member reads the first card and places it on the table, passing the remaining stack to the next team member. # The second team member reads the second card, may declare a belief that the story is larger or smaller than the card already on the table or may ask the team for help in so determining, and establishes which direction is smaller or larger by placing the card to the left or right of the first card; and passes the remaining stack to the next team member. # The third team member has a choice: to move the position of the second card; or to read the third card, declare a belief that the story is larger than the first two, smaller than the first two; or belongs between the first two; and passes the remaining stack to the next team member. # When all the cards are on the table - if the product manager truly provided a project's worth, then there are likely 60 or 100 or 130 cards and the team has had to \\"snake\\" them to fit them all - then the team begins with the smallest story and assigns it a \\"1\\", continuing to assign \\"1\\"s to subsequent stories until they see an obvious jump to \\"2\\"s, and then to \\"3\\"s, \\"5\\"s, \\"8\\"s, and so on. With the result that the \\"snake\\" of cards is now numbered from the smallest story, a \\"1\\", to the largest epic, a \\"100\\". This method has the advantages that numbers are not used until the second pass; that no guessing is required for the first story read as to how big a \\"5\\" or \\"8\\" or \\"3\\" is; that stories are truly ordered and numbered relative to each other; and when not everyone can estimate the entire story. Regardless of method, as the team goes through multiple sprints and the estimation process is improved, the product manager will be able to determine a stable velocity. The velocity is determined by calculating the number of story points completed in each iteration.  Significance  People estimate user stories with smaller points more accurately than user stories that have higher costs associated with them. As the numbers increase, the difference between two succeeding numbers increases exponentially and leads to less accurate estimates. * Using Fibonacci series is helpful in this scenario because the larger user stories (i.e. stories of size greater than 8) that tend to lead to inconsistent estimates between each team member can be grouped to the nearest estimated Fibonacci number of the corresponding bucket in the backlog. * In case of small user stories the bucket difference is small and hence the final cost of resource and time can be finalized more accurately. One good way to estimate the cost is to express it in terms of multiples of other known user stories' costs. This way, it will be easier for each team member to estimate the relative cost. The estimation process of comparing a story with two previously estimated user stories is called triangulation. The product manager can include a \\"0\\" value in the scale indicating that the user stories need very little time or resources. However, the user story that was assigned 0 cost cannot be used as a relative scale to estimate the cost of other user stories (i.e. we cannot say a story is 10 times harder than a story of size 0). An advantage of Fibonacci sequence is that it allows developers to disaggregate a user story from one large bucket into two preceding buckets (since a bucket is formed by adding the size of two preceding buckets). This process helps to create optimal user stories.

He was killed in action during the Battle of Petersburg and brevetted brigadier general. Early life and education Stedman was born in Hartford, Connecticut on January 6, 1838 to Griffin Alexander and Mary (Shields) Stedman. He graduated from Hartford High School and from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut in 1859. After graduation, he practiced law in Philadelphia. Civil War When the Civil War began he joined the Washington Greys in Philadelphia. He returned to Hartford and joined the First Regiment Colt's Revolving Rifles formed by gunmaker Samuel Colt. The First Regiment reformed and became the 5th Connecticut Infantry Regiment with Stedman commissioned as captain of company I. Stedman and the 5th Regiment were mustered into service on July 22, 1861. On November 27, 1861 he was commissioned major in the 11th Connecticut Infantry Regiment. On June 11, 1862 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and returned with the regiment to the Army of the Potomac and fought in the Battle of Antietam. At Antietam, he had command of the right wing of the regiment in the attack on the stone bridge and was wounded in the leg. He became Colonel on September 25, 1862 and was in command during the Battle of Fredericksburg. In January 1864, the regiment re- enlisted and on its return to the front was assigned to the Eighteenth Corps. On May 9, his troops were engaged at the Battle of Swift Creek and on May 16 at the Battle of Drewery's Bluff where he lost almost 200 men. In late May, he commanded the brigade and fought at Cold Harbor. He was mortally wounded by a bullet in his side during the Battle of Petersburg on August 5, 1864 and died on August 6, 1864. Major General Edward Ord attempted to have Stedman promoted to brevet brigadier general before his death but instead it was awarded posthumously. Cedar Hill Cemetery Stedman sarcophagus with obelisk in background He was originally interred in Cedar Grove Cemetery in New London, Connecticut and was re-interred in the family plot in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut on May 20, 1875. The sarcophagus is carved with his ornamental sword, cap and belt, inscribed with the battles he fought in and the words \\"Brave, just, generous and pure, without fear and reproach\\". Legacy Griffin A. Stedman Monument in the Barry Square neighborhood of Hartford Fort Stedman in Petersburg, Virginia was named in his honor. A bronze statue in his likeness in the Barry Square neighborhood of Hartford, Connecticut was designed by Frederick Moynihan and cast at the Gorham Manufacturing Company. The neighborhood was the former location of Camp-Field, which was the location of muster for Hartford troops training for the Civil War. After the war, the 22nd and 25th Regiments established the Camp-Field Monument Association with the intent to erect a monument to dedicate the site. The association wanted to depict a typical Connecticut volunteer with a military history associated with the site. The association selected Stedman as the subject of the statue. Stedman Street in Hartford is named after him and the General Griffin A. Stedman Jr. Memorial Scholarship at Trinity was instituted in his honor.

It is an industrial water works structure built in the Victorian style, and a rare example of such a structure in Canada to be \\"architecturally and functionally largely intact\\". It is currently used to house the Museum of Steam and Technology. Its construction began in 1856, with the work contracted to local stonemason George Worthington, and was completed by 1859. It was opened on 18 September 1860 by Edward VII, at the time the Prince of Wales, during a two-month royal tour to Canada. It was formally designated a heritage site on 17 November 1977, and listed as a National Historic Site of Canada on 12 June 2007. Background In 1833, Hamilton's water system consisted of five wells. A December 1853 report to city standing committee on fire and water, prepared by William Hodgins, proposed a public water system using Ancaster Creek as a source to avoid using pumps or sourcing water from the potentially contaminated Burlington Bay. The committee dismissed the proposal, and in September 1854 announced a public competition to design a public water system suitable for 40,000 inhabitants, about four times the population of the city. A prize of ¬£100 was offered. This was prompted by a cholera epidemic in the city, which killed 552 people in the summer of 1854. Thomas Keefer was hired to review the submissions, and on 23 December 1854 announced that American engineer Samuel McElroy was the winning candidate. His design included a pumping station at Burlington Heights, and a reservoir near the intersection of York Street and Dundurn Street. Council opted not to build this station, partly encouraged by Keefer whose reports recorded \\"peculiar\\" characteristics of the water from Burlington Bay. In January 1857, Hamilton City Council chose Keefer to be chief engineer to build a public water system drawing water from Lake Ontario. A fountain was installed at Gore Park to remind the city's residents of the pure water that had become available to them. Description The complex is located adjacent to Globe Park, with Queen Elizabeth Way to the east and Woodward Avenue to the west. There are several components to the site. The pump house used steam pressure to pump water from Lake Ontario to a reservoir above the Niagara Escarpment, the boiler house generated the steam, the chimney exhausted the smoke, and the woodshed stored the fuel, initially wood and later coal. The water was distributed to the city's buildings through pipes by gravity. The interior of the Italianate pump house building retains its original machinery, floors, and balustrades. Two Woolf Compound Engines were originally installed, each one a condensing rotative beam engine producing 100 hp built in Dundas. A massive stone structure was built around each 90-ton, engine for support. One of these steam engines still operates, now powered by an electric motor. The chimney is built of brick atop a large stone base consisting of two types of stone. Both the yellow-brown bioturbated Eramosa dolomite and the grey Whirlpool cross- bedding and laminated sandstone were quarried at Stoney Creek. National Historic Site of Canada On 17 November 1977, the Hamilton Waterworks was officially recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada. In addition to the original pumping station, the site also includes the boilerhouse, chimney, and shed, all of which were built in 1859, a second shed built by Worthington in 1910 with a steam pump, a pumphouse built in 1913, a carpenter shed built in 1915, and valves and valve chambers installed throughout the 1900s. Legacy The building's exterior has been featured in the television show Murdoch Mysteries as the setting for the Toronto morgue.
