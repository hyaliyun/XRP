Pollack co-developed the vaccine, also known by the RhoGAM brand name, which is given to pregnant women to prevent Rh disease, with Dr. Vincent Freda and Dr. John G. Gorman of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Pollack's vaccine, introduced in 1968, virtually eliminated cases of Rh disease in developed countries. Prior to the RhoGAM vaccine, Rh disease was responsible for approximately 10,000 infant deaths in the United States annually. The development of the RhoGAM vaccine has been called one of the ten greatest medical breakthroughs of the 20th Century. Pollack, Freda and Gorman were awarded the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award for their achievement in 1980. Early life and education Pollack was born in London on February 26, 1926, to David and Rose Pollack. He served in the Royal Navy during World War II. He enrolled at Imperial College, London after the war, earning a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1948. In 1950, Pollack received a master's degree from St. George's Hospital Medical School. He then worked in the pathology department at St. George's from 1948 to 1954. Career Pollack moved to British Columbia, Canada, in 1954 to become a director of a blood bank and clinical laboratory. In 1956, he moved, this time to Raritan, New Jersey, where he joined the staff of Ortho Pharmaceutical, where he began his research on his Rh disease vaccine. He would eventually become Ortho Pharmaceutical's vice president and director of research. Pollack obtained a doctorate in zoology at Rutgers University while researching Rh disease at Ortho. Pollack later taught immunology at Rutgers University and Columbia University. Illness and death Dr. William Pollock died from complications of diabetes and heart disease on November 3, 2013, in Yorba Linda, California, at the age of 87. He was survived by his sons, Malcolm and David, and predeceased by his wife, Alison Calder, who died in 2006.

The French establishments of Pondicherry, Karikal, Mah√© and Yanam became territories of the Indian Union on 16 August 1962, with the ratification of the Treaty of Cession by India and France. The 14th Amendment came into effect on 28 December 1962. Text Constitutional changes Section 2 of the amendment amended article 81(1) (b) of the Constitution in order to raise the maximum number of seats in the Lok Sabha for members representing the Union territories from 20 to 25, thus enabling representation to be given to the Union territory of Pondicherry. The First Schedule to the Constitution was amended to include the territories of Pondicherry with effect from 16 August 1962. The Fourth Schedule to the Constitution was amended to allocate one seat in Rajya Sabha to the Union territory of Pondicherry. The insertion of a new article 239A in the Constitution, gave Parliament the authority to create by law, Legislatures and Councils of Ministers for the Union territories of Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Goa, Daman and Diu and Pondicherry. Section 4 of the Amendment provided that any law passed for this purpose would not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purpose of article 368. Clause (1) of article 240 of the Constitution was amended to include the Union territory of Pondicherry in order to enable the President to \\"make regulations for the peace, progress and good government\\" of the territory. However, the President would cease to make regulations, when any body is created under the new article 239A to function as a Legislature for Union territories of Goa, Daman and Diu or Pondicherry, with effect from the date appointed for the first meeting of such Legislature. Proposal and enactment The Constitution (Fourteenth Amendment) Bill, 1962 (Bill No. 86 of 1962) was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 30 August 1962. It was introduced by Lal Bahadur Shastri, then Minister of Home Affairs, and sought to amend articles 81 and 240, and the First and the Fourth Schedules to the Constitution. It also sought to insert a new article 239A in the Constitution. The full text of the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the bill is given below: The bill was considered and passed, with some modifications, by the Lok Sabha on 4 September 1962. The bill passed by the Lok Sabha, was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 7 September 1962. Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 5 to 7 of the Bill were adopted, in the original form, by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on 4 and 7 September 1962, respectively. Clause 4 of the Bill sought to insert a new article 239A in the Constitution, which would empower Parliament to create by law, Legislatures and Councils of Ministers for certain Union territories. Hari Vishnu Kamath moved an amendment to Clause 4 in the Lok Sabha, which sought to omit the words \\"nominated or\\" after the word \\"whether\\" in clause 1(a) of the new article 239A, be omitted. The amended Clause 4 was adopted by the Lok Sabha, and later by the Rajya Sabha. The effect of the amendment was that the Legislatures of the Union territories could not be wholly nominated bodies. The bill received assent from then President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan on 28 December 1962, and came into force on the same date. It was notified in The Gazette of India on 29 December 1962. Ratification The Act was passed in accordance with the provisions of Article 368 of the Constitution, and was ratified by half of the State Legislatures, as required under Clause (2) of the said article.

Titled \\"Breakaway\\", it was covered by Canadian singer Celine Dion for her English-language studio album, Loved Me Back to Life (2013). \\"Breakaway\\" was co-written by Johan Fransson, Tim Larsson, Tobias Lundgren and Audra Mae, and produced by Play Production. The song was released by Dion as a promotional single in the United Kingdom on 5 December 2013 and in France on 22 January 2014. Background and release \\"Breakaway\\" and \\"Somebody Loves Somebody\\" are two songs on Dion's album Loved Me Back to Life produced by Swedish trio Play Production (Johan Fransson, Tim Larsson and Tobias Lundgren). Both songs were co-written by Fransson, Larsson, Lundgren and Audra Mae, the great-great-niece of Judy Garland. On 2 December 2013, Dion's official website announced \\"Breakaway\\" as the second UK single. Two days earlier, it was chosen as a \\"Record of the Week\\" on BBC Radio 2. The official audio for the single was released onto Dion's Vevo channel on 3 December 2013. Two days later, \\"Breakaway\\" was added to the A-List on BBC Radio 2's Playlist in the UK. The song peaked at number thirty-eight on the UK Radio Airplay Chart in mid-December 2013 but did not enter the UK Singles Chart. On 22 January 2014, \\"Breakaway\\" was announced as the second single in France and was sent to radio stations on the same day. Critical reception \\"Breakaway\\" received positive reviews from music critics. Jim Farber of Daily News wrote that it \\"balances modern R&B; with '60s lounge music in a way that would flatter Adele\\". USA Today editor Elysa Gardner included this song in her download list and added \\"Dion starts out low and sultry, then lets her big, creamy soprano rip ‚Äî a pattern she follows on the \\"Wall of Sound\\"-inspired Breakaway\\". Gary Graff from The Oakland Press praised the vocal buildup \\"from the lower reaches of her register, a husker tone that sounds just as good as the more pristine approach that's her stock in trade\\". Andrew Hampp of Billboard also praised \\"Breakaway\\" calling it \\"powerful\\" and the song which features \\"arguably the grittiest, most authentically \\"rock\\" vocal we've ever heard or would expect from Dion\\". Deban Aderemi of Wiwibloggs commented that \\"Breakaway\\" is a beautiful piano-led track. The song's orchestration is rich, Dion's delivery is dynamic, yet she remains committed to a performance that comes from the soul. Live performances In early November 2013, Dion performed \\"Breakaway\\" for the UK show, Strictly Come Dancing which was broadcast during the semi-finals on 15 December 2013.

He is a partner and Chair of the Whistleblower Representation Practice at Labaton Sucharow LLP (2011‚Äìpresent), where he represents whistleblowers reporting violations of the federal securities laws to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He began his legal career as a Judge Advocate General in the U.S. Navy (1995‚Äì1999). Prior to entering private practice, Thomas served as an Assistant Director and Assistant Chief Litigation Counsel in the SEC's Division of Enforcement (2003‚Äì2011) and as a trial attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice (1999‚Äì2003). Thomas served as the Chair of the Investor Rights Committee of the District of Columbia Bar (2014‚Äì17) and a board member of the City Bar Justice Center, the pro bono affiliate of the New York City Bar Association. (2013‚Äì16).  Early life and education  Thomas stated he had a troubled childhood in Los Angeles, becoming an emancipated minor at 15. He eventually moved to Vermont to break from his past life, legally changing his name to Jordan Andolini Thomas. He chose Michael Jordan and Vito Andolini Corleone as his namesake, while electing Thomas as it was similar to his original surname, Thompson. He attended Bennington College, where he received his B.A.; he later earned his J.D. from Southwestern University School of Law.http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/jordan_thomas_silent_no_more/ Jordan Thomas Wrote the Rules on‚Äîand Represents‚ÄîWhistleblowers  Professional history   SEC Enforcement experience  While at the SEC, Thomas played a role in the development of the SEC Whistleblower Program, established under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Thomas also developed and served as the first National Coordinator of the SEC's Cooperation Program, designed to encourage individuals and companies to self- report violations of the federal securities laws and to participate in the SEC's investigations and enforcement actions.  Private whistleblower representation  After leaving the SEC, Thomas joined Labaton Sucharow LLP as a partner. He founded and chairs the first national legal practice exclusively devoted to protecting and advocating for whistleblowers who report possible securities violations to the SEC. In explaining his decision to leave the Commission, Thomas said, \\"I believe the SEC whistleblower program will revolutionize the way the SEC enforces the securities laws. And having helped give birth to the program, I would like to be part of seeing it be successful.\\" He represented the first officer of a public company to win an SEC whistleblower award, the first SEC whistleblower to receive criminal immunity and the first SEC whistleblower to receive an award because his company retaliated against him.  Whistleblower cases  JPMorgan‚ÄîThomas represented a whistleblower responsible for the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission's $307 million settlements with two J.P. Morgan wealth management subsidiaries in December 2015. The New York Times called the settlement a \\"black mark for JPMorgan's asset management division,\\" which had over $1 trillion of assets under management. From 2008 to 2015, the subsidiaries failed to disclose numerous material conflicts of interest, including, but not limited to their preference for investing in the firm's more expensive proprietary investment products or third-party managed hedge funds that made payments to a JPMorgan affiliate. This case directly impacted more than 100,000 clients and was the largest monetary sanction ever levied against an investment adviser and the second largest SEC enforcement action of the year. Merrill Lynch‚ÄîThomas represented the whistleblowers responsible for the SEC's $415 million settlement with Merrill Lynch in June 2016. In discussing the importance of the record-setting settlement, Andrew Ceresney, the SEC Director of Enforcement, said \\"[t]he rules concerning the safety of customer cash and securities are fundamental protections for investors and impose lines that simply can never be crossed.\\" From 2009 to 2015, Merrill Lynch misused customer cash to generate profits for the firm, failed to safeguard customer securities from the claims of creditors and used illegal secrecy agreements that impeded employees from voluntarily providing information to the SEC. The wrongdoing in this case involved more than $50 billion in customer assets, led to a new industry-wide initiative by the Commission to find similar violations by other firms, was \\"by far the largest customer protection settlement in SEC history\\" and the largest SEC enforcement action of the year. Visium Asset Management‚ÄîThomas represented the whistleblower responsible for the Department of Justice and SEC investigations of Visium Asset Management, an $8 billion hedge fund. The whistleblower had himself been part of the scheme he reported.SEC Whistleblower Prodded On Misconduct At Fraud Trial - Law360 Law enforcement and regulatory authorities charged that three rogue portfolio managers at the firm had mishandled the valuation of its credit portfolio, and that two of them had engaged in insider trading. The investigation led to the 2016 wind-down of a Wall Street behemoth and the successful criminal prosecution of one rogue trader, as a second rogue trader pleaded guilty. It was the most high-profile shutdown since Steve Cohen's SAC Capital closed in 2013. Harbert Management‚ÄîThomas represented, with co-counsel from Getnick & Getnick LLP, the whistleblower responsible for the New York Attorney General's $40 million settlement with Alabama-based Harbert Management Corporation and top executives at the firm in April 2017. Harbert Management was the fund sponsor for Harbinger Capital Partners, a $26 billion hedge fund based in New York City. The settlement, the largest-ever recovery of its kind, resolved whistleblower allegations that members of Harbinger's investment manager failed to pay millions in New York State tax on performance income for several years. Attorney General Schneiderman praised his client's \\"vital assistance in bringing this matter to light\\" and stated, \\"our investigation uncovered a brazen and deliberate decision to avoid paying millions in taxes owed to New York State. Harbert Management made a clear choice to skirt the rules and as a result, ordinary New York taxpayers were left footing the bill.\\" Orthofix International‚ÄîThomas represented two whistleblowers responsible for the SEC's $8.25 million settlement with Orthofix International, a Texas-based medical device company, in January 2017. His clients, Wall Street analysts, tipped the government to the most serious charges facing the company, accounting failures that caused the company to materially misstate financial statements from at least 2011 to the first quarter of 2013. \\"Orthofix's accounting failures were widespread and significant, causing Orthofix to make false statements to the public about its financial condition,\\" said Antonia Chion, Associate Director in the SEC's Enforcement Division.  Public whistleblower advocacy  Domestically, Thomas has lobbied lawmakers to preserve the pillars of the SEC Whistleblower Program‚Äîanonymous reporting, employment protections and monetary awards. Troubled by the use of secrecy agreements and retaliation to silence SEC whistleblowers, in partnership with the Government Accountability Project, he led a coalition of more than 250 organizations and nearly two million citizens to petition the SEC for action. Following this grassroots advocacy, the Commission has aggressively prosecuted numerous prominent companies for engaging in these illegal practices. Internationally, Thomas has been invited to engagements at the United Nations, UK House of Commons and Australian Parliament. Following public hearings which included his testimony about the SEC Whistleblower Program and its potential application in Ontario, the Ontario Securities Commission established a whistleblower program.

The seventh named storm of the 1996‚Äì97 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gretelle developed within the intertropical convergence zone on January 19, and gradually intensified while moving southwestward. On January 22, the storm intensified to tropical cyclone status while passing northwest of R√©union; there, Gretelle produced strong wind gusts and heavy rainfall in mountainous regions. Subsequently, the cyclone strengthened to reach peak 10-minute sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). On January 24, Gretelle made landfall near Farafangana, the first in the region in 41 years. The cyclone weakened while crossing Madagascar, but restrengthened slightly in the Mozambique Channel. Gretelle meandered off the coast of Mozambique, bringing gusty winds that downed trees, but caused little damage. An approaching trough turned the cyclone to the southeast, and Gretelle dissipated on January 31 to the south-southwest of Madagascar. Damage from Cyclone Gretelle was heaviest near where it made landfall in Madagascar. In several villages, over 90% of the buildings were destroyed, leaving about 80,000 people homeless. Wind gusts at Farafangan reached , which knocked trees onto roads and wrecked about 138,000 tons of crops. Heavy rainfall and high waves flooded coastal regions, in some areas up to deep. Overall damage was estimated at around $50 million, and there were 152 deaths. After the storm, there was a coordinated international relief effort to provide food and money to Madagascar. Meteorological history The intertropical convergence zone spawned a tropical disturbance on January 19, developing a circulation just west of St. Brandon. That day, the M√©t√©o-France on R√©union (MFR) classified the system as a tropical disturbance, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the system as a low-pressure area a day prior. The system intensified into Tropical Storm Gretelle late on January 20, by which time the JTWC gave it the designation Tropical Cyclone 20S. Due to a large ridge centered near √éle Amsterdam, the storm tracked generally southwestward toward the Mascarene Islands. Early on January 22, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, and later that day, the MFR upgraded Gretelle to tropical cyclone status, or with 10-minute sustained winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph). Shortly after attaining tropical cyclone status, Gretelle made its closest point of approach to R√©union late on January 22, passing about northwest of the island. Subsequently, the cyclone developed a small eye, and the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) at 0000 UTC on January 23\\\\. Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated Gretelle continued to intensify to a 1-minute sustained wind peak of 215 km/h (130 mph) at 0600 UTC on January 24, equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Later that day, the cyclone made landfall on southeastern Madagascar near Farafangana near peak intensity. Reports from the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs considered Gretelle the first cyclone to strike the region in 41 years. Gretelle rapidly weakened over land, emerging into the Mozambique Channel as a tropical depression on January 25\\\\. Continuing to the southwest, the depression re-intensified into a tropical storm on January 27. After becoming a tropical storm again, Gretelle slowed in the Mozambique Channel. A cold front bypassed the storm to the south, and a building ridge behind it turned Gretelle to a west-northwest drift. Although it approached southeastern Africa on January 28, an advancing trough turned the storm to the southeast. The next day, the JTWC briefly re-upgraded Gretelle to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, and on January 30, the MFO estimated a secondary 10-minute wind peak of 85 km/h (50 mph). Accelerating to the south-southeast, Gretelle dissipated on January 31 well to the south- southwest of Madagascar. Impact Satellite image of Gretelle in the Mozambique Channel While passing north of R√©union, Gretelle dropped heavy rainfall in the eastern and western portions of the island. Over 48 hours, rainfall totaled nearly at Commerson Crater, while Mafate recorded over . Gretelle produced gusts of about in portions of R√©union. Late in its duration, the cyclone produced heavy rainfall but left minimal damage in Mozambique, estimated at $50,000. Winds of over 55 km/h (34 km/h) knocked over trees and caused power outages in Gaza and Maputo provinces. Officials in South Africa issued rain and wind warnings for the northeast coast. In Madagascar, Gretelle produced wind gusts of over at Vangaindrano near where it moved ashore, and over at Farafangana. The storm also dropped heavy rainfall, although peak totals were unknown due to the meteorological station in Farafangana being destroyed. Heavy rainfall and high waves left heavy damage near the coast, washing away several boats and causing rivers to overflow. Floods in some areas reached deep. Where Gretelle made landfall, most buildings were damaged or destroyed excluding those made of concrete, leaving about 80,000 people homeless. Among the wrecked buildings included a hospital and a prison. About 95% of homes in Vondrozo were wrecked, and in Farafangana, 90% of government buildings were destroyed. In both southern Midongy and Vangaindrano, nearly every building was destroyed. Gretelle damaged or destroyed 1,538 homes in Manakara. Reports from the Red Cross indicated that Gretelle was the severest in the region \\"in living memory\\", with many people surviving the high tides and winds by \\"clinging to trees\\". The storm also damaged water stations, power lines, and thousands of hectares of crops, including food reserves. The World Food Programme estimated that Gretelle destroyed 7,000 tons of rice, 123,500 tons of cassava, and 8,000 tons of cash crops, mostly to coffee. About 40,000 people were isolated for weeks after the storm in Befotaka and Midongy Sud, with many roads blocked by fallen trees. Overall, about 200 people were killed or left missing in Madagascar, with 152 confirmed fatalities by two weeks after the storm, 82 of whom in Vangaindrano. The International Disaster Database later listed 140 as the total fatalities related to Gretelle. Damage from the storm was estimated at $50 million. Aftermath After heavy damage from Cyclone Bonita in 1996, the government of Madagascar initiated a disaster response system that was used during Gretelle; there was quick response but efforts were hampered by damaged infrastructure and disrupted transportation. The storm had cut communications in some areas, but by January 29, or five days after landfall, telephone service was restored to Manakara. Following the storm, the Madagascar government coordinated the distribution of emergency rice rations and other relief items. On January 27, the government launched a fundraiser on television that raised over ‚Ç£130 million (FMG, US$30,000). The southern portion of the country was declared a disaster area. A plane of relief supplies flew from the capital Antananarivo to Manakara along the southeast coast, where trucks distributed the items to the affected areas. A radio station based out of the country criticized the slow pace of relief, citing the lack of available boats after many were destroyed. In addition, there were reports that government aid was being stolen by looters. In the weeks after the storm, the hardest hit residents faced food shortages and lacked access to clean water, in an area already facing ongoing food shortages. In response, the World Food Programme and other agencies of the United Nations created a program to feed about 350,000 people in the region over three months, providing about 5,900 tons of food. In the months after the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes to compensate for the damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition. In the subsequent years, about 40% of the forest at Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region. Due to the scale of the cyclone damage, the government issued an international appeal for assistance. As a result, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided a grant of $30,000. UNICEF provided about $48,000 to secure drug kits for children impacted by the cyclone. The Red Cross of Seychelles donated about one tonne of clothing and 20 tonnes of tuna, and the Red Cross of R√©union sent drugs to Madagascar. The government of France also sent a crew from R√©union to Madagascar to assist in the aftermath, as well as a plane to airdrop the aid. The governments of Germany, Japan, France, the United Kingdom each donated about $100,000 to Madagascar, while the United States provided about $25,000 and 500 tons of food. The government of Japan also sent 2,040 blankets and 10 tents. By February 18, the total contributions by the international community reached about $3 million.

The company was founded in Montreal in 1963 by Paul Golbert.\\"Pajar Canada founder Paul Golbert in his shoemaker father's arms in front of their shop in Livry-Gargan.\\" October 18, 2013 Paul found the inspiration for the company‚Äôs name by using the first letters of his name, his son‚Äôs name and his wife‚Äôs name, (PAul, JAcques, and Rachel), respectively. Today, Pajar produces more than 900,000 pairs of boots a year. Their products are exported to more than 40 countries, with European sales done via a regional head office in Amsterdam. History The company was founded by Paul Golbert in 1963 after he immigrated to Montreal with his wife and son. Paul was born into a family of shoemakers in Paris, France in 1926. \\"About Pajar\\" Golbert became a pioneer of the Canadian footwear industry when he began to import Spanish, French and Italian footwear, opening his first showroom in 1967. During this time, he also worked for Tyrol, a Canadian boots company. When the owners of Tyrol died, Paul took their key employees and started his own factory, becoming a producer of Canadian footwear in 1973. The factory, located in the Plateau district of Montreal on the corner of Mount Royal Avenue and Coloniale Street, is still standing today. The company is still entirely family-owned, and is now run by Paul‚Äôs son Jacques, and his grandson, Michel. In an article featured in The Montreal Gazette,\\"Pajar Boots: Walking in Style\\". October 22, 2013 Jacques explains his family history in a nutshell: ‚ÄúMy dad was the third generation in the shoe business, I‚Äôm the fourth, and my sons are the fifth. It‚Äôs in our blood, shoe manufacturing.‚Äù Pajar became the official provider for the Canadian Alpine Ski Team in 1989.

Having completed this journey the aircraft remained at Singapore and the Flight was redesignated No. 205 Squadron RAF, the first RAF unit to be permanently based there.  Background and objectives  During the 1920s the RAF carried out a number of long-distance flights to explore air- routes and facilities and test the feasibility of long-range reinforcement of more distant parts of the British Empire. The RAF's first international long- range cruise by flying boats was to Egypt in July 1926. The success of that trip paved the way for subsequent longer journeys and the Far East Flight was formed to undertake a journey to Australia and the Far East starting in 1927. The project's publicised aims were to gain experience with the operation of flying boats independent of surface vessels and shore bases, gather information the suitability of locations along the route for flying boats, and to 'fly the flag'; fostering cooperation between Britain and her Empire. The Flight covered approximately 23000 miles (37000 km) from Felixstowe to Singapore, around Australia and back to Singapore between 17 October 1927 and 18 September 1928. A further 4500 miles (7241 km) were flown on the final leg, a return trip from Singapore to Hong Kong in November and December 1928.  Aircraft  Supermarine Southampton flying boats Five new metal-hulled Supermarine Southampton II flying boats were assigned to the Flight. Aircraft S1149, S1150, S1151 and S1152 were delivered to Felixstowe in September 1927, and these four competed the Felixstowe-Singapore-Australia-Singapore legs of the cruise. The fifth aircraft, S1127, was shipped as a spare to Singapore. This aircraft replaced S1149 for the final Singapore-Hong Kong leg on Air Ministry instructions. The aircraft were prepared with a number of modifications from standard specification. Hulls and wingtip floats were finished with white enamel and larger engine radiators, oil tanks and top- plane fuel tanks were fitted. In addition, there were internal changes to provide more space and support facilities for the crew, who had to live on board for periods during the trip. Metal, instead of wooden, airscrews were fitted to the aircraft during the flight. Specially designed collapsible rubber dinghies were also carried. No automatic pilots or blind flying aids were fitted, and only two of the four aircraft had radio sets ‚Äì communication between aircraft in the air being by lamp or hand-signals.  Personnel  The Flight was commanded by Group Captain Henry M. Cave-Browne-Cave DSO DFC, appointed on 17 May 1927 . Cave-Browne-Cave captained S1152 and led the flight to Singapore, around Australia and back to Singapore. In August 1929 he took command of No. 205 Squadron formed from the redesignated Flight in Singapore. The three other aircraft were captained by Squadron Leader G. E.

Career At the time of the 1959 Cuban Revolution Veciana was employed as an accountant by Julio Lobo, and well known as the President of the professional accountants' association. Veciana was recruited as a spy for the CIA by David Atlee Phillips (also known as Maurice Bishop) in 1959 to kill Fidel Castro. After the initial contact with Bishop, Veciana took a 2-3 week course in psychological warfare and sabotage. After the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961, Bishop directed Veciana to help organise an assassination attempt on Castro in Havana from an apartment rented in the name of Veciana's mother- in-law. Veciana left Cuba the day before the October 1961 attempt, his wife and children having already left some months earlier. The attempt, which involved a bazooka, failed.Jay Mallin, The Miami News, 23 November 1961, A BAZOOKA DIDN'T FIRE IN HAVANA AND CASTRO TALKED ON  1960s, Alpha 66  Veciana settled in Miami with his family, and after Bishop contacted him there, at Bishop's direction Veciana founded Alpha 66 in mid-1962, becoming its civilian chief and principal fundraiser, and recruiting its military chief from another Cuban exile organization. Alpha 66 became one of the most active Cuban exile groups, acquiring guns and boats and launching commando raids on Cuba. From August 1968 to June 1972 Veciana was active in Bolivia. Formally a banking adviser to the Central Bank of Bolivia on contracts financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, his office was located in the passport division of the American Embassy, and his primary activity was organising anti-Communist and anti-Castro activities. This included another assassination attempt on Castro in Chile in 1971 involving a plan to put a gun inside a television camera. Veciana's recruiting of Cuban associates who prepared a plan to blame Russian agents for the assassination led to a falling-out with Bishop and the eventual termination of their relationship. When Bishop broke off the relationship in 1973, he paid Veciana $253,000 in recognition of his services; Veciana had previously refused payment.  1970s, and HSCA interview  In 1974 Veciana was convicted of conspiracy to supply narcotics; he served 27 months, still professing his innocence after his release. In 1976 Veciana told the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) that at one meeting with Bishop in Dallas in late-August or September 1963 he had arrived to see Bishop talking with Lee Harvey Oswald. Veciana said that several months after the assassination Bishop had offered to pay a relative of Veciana who worked in the Cuban Intelligence Directorate in Mexico City to say publicly that he had met Oswald there. On September 21, 1979 in Miami, Veciana was wounded in the head during a drive-by shooting while he was riding in his car. He was initially admitted to Pan American Hospital with a small-caliber bullet imbedded above his left ear, then transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital. Veciana's family and friends said that agents of the Cuban government had attempted to kill him. Veciana was not active in Alpha 66 at the time of the shooting. His wife said he had received death threats eight months earlier, and Nazario Sargen, the then current leader of Alpha 66, said Veciana told a press conference a few months previously that the Cuban government was planning to kill him after he had learned about the plot from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Later years  Veciana was briefly employed as treasurer by Maurice Ferr√©'s 2004 campaign for mayor of Miami-Dade. He resigned after a few days, as he did not meet the state requirement of being a registered voter.Noaki Schwartz, Miami Herald, 2 June 2005, Audit: Ferr√© camp broke the law In 2013 Veciana gave interviews saying that he believed that the assassination of John F.

The four-storey house was built as one of three in 1742 by Thomas Andrews; only two of the houses survive to the present day. A wealthy Jewish widow was the first occupier of the house, with the brewer Harry Charrington living there from 1794 to 1833 (Charrington Brewery had offices in the Mile End Road). Charrington greatly altered the house, and following his occupancy the house was subdivided, and shops built on the front garden. Malplaquet House is named after the Battle of Malplaquet, one of the main battles of the War of the Spanish Succession, which took place in France in 1709. However, it is not known whether this naming came from the Jewish widow of the London merchant, who made his living selling war salvage, or from a later resident, the military surgeon Edward Lee. During the rest of the 19th century, the house played host to a variety of small businesses including a bookmaker and a printer, before being occupied in 1910 by the Union of Stepney Ratepayers. The Stepney union remained in the house until 1975. During their occupation, Malplaquet House was further subdivided and additions made to its structure. Malplaquet House was damaged during the London Blitz, but repairs began in 1951 after a ¬£100 donation from the War Damage Association. The architect Richard Seifert provided new shop fronts for the house. Malplaquet House was badly degraded by the 1990s, and the intervention of the Spitalfields Trust helped save it from potential demolition. In 1998, Tim Knox (former director of Sir John Soane's Museum and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, now Director of the Royal Collection) and landscape gardener Todd Longstaffe-Gowan purchased the house from the Spitalfields Trust for ¬£250,000. It had been uninhabited for over a century. Knox and Longstaffe-Gowan's collections of objets d'art and esoteric objects, obtained from Portobello Market, auctions and flea markets, expanded to fill Malplaquet House. In 2010, it was described by The Daily Telegraph as \\"possibly the most superbly restored, privately owned Georgian house in the country\\". The house is part of a group of Grade II listed buildings on the Mile End Road, listed as 133‚Äì139 Mile End Road. It has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since March 1978.

His father, on going to England in 1642, entrusted him with the command of Boyle Castle, County Roscommon. His abilities as a leader were displayed on many occasions, particularly at the relief of Elphin Castle and he continued very active during this time of confusion, and frequently disturbed Heber MacMahon the Roman Catholic Bishop of Clogher then general of the Ulster army. By 1650 he was a member of Cromwell's army and on 11 June 1650, was instrumental in gaining the celebrated victory over his forces at the Battle of Scarrifholis, when he took the bishop prisoner by his own hand. Parliament accorded him full powers, and on 26 July 1649 ordered him to be paid ¬£100 from delinquents' estates \\"in consideration of long attendance\\". cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1649‚Äì50, p. 582. He was then a colonel. On 7 June 1658 he was knighted by Henry Cromwell, lord deputy-general of Ireland. cites Metcalfe, Book of Knights, p. 215.

On 1 October 1670 he was appointed one of the commissioners to examine and state the arrears due to the king before the commencement of that year, of the farm of the revenue for seven years. On 15 July 1674 had a grant by patent of a substantial yearly pension. It was also provided by the Act of Settlement 1662 that all his claims to land should be ratified and confirmed to him and his heirs. For his arrears of service before 5 June 1649 he received four several grants of land. By letters patent dated 25 January 1664 he had confirmed to him the town and lands of Kilcolman, with other lands, amounting to some thousands of acres, in the counties of Limerick, Cork, and Kildare.

UN Special Representative Appointment Nicholas Kay with Somali president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud On 29 April 2013, Kay was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as the new UN Special Representative for Somalia. He officially replaced Augustine Mahiga at the position on 3 June 2013. Vote of confidence In December 2013, following a parliamentary vote of confidence, Kay paid tribute to the outgoing Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon, noting that Shirdon had endeavoured to promote growth and progress and was an important principal in establishing the New Deal Compact between Somalia and its international partners. He also commended the legislators on adhering to procedural rules during the vote, and pledged to work constructively with the succeeding administration. Following the appointment of Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed as the new Premier, Kay congratulated Ahmed on his appointment and pledged to continue supporting the Federal Government's peace and state-building efforts. Somalia-UN cooperative agreement On 26 February 2014, Kay and Somalia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdirahman Duale Beyle signed a bilateral agreement outlining the terms of future cooperation between the United Nations and the Somali federal government. According to Beyle, the pact came after extensive consultations between both parties. Along with attorneys, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud attended the signing of the agreement, which he commended for helping to strengthen cooperation between the Somali authorities and the UN. Jubaland agreement Kay inspecting the guard of honour during the inauguration of the United Nations Guard Unit in Somalia In August 2013, the autonomous Jubaland administration signed a national reconciliation agreement in Addis Ababa with the Somali federal government. Endorsed by the federal State Minister for the Presidency Farah Abdulkadir on behalf of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the pact was brokered by the Foreign Ministry of Ethiopia and came after protracted bilateral talks. Under the terms of the agreement, Jubaland will be administered for a two-year period by a Juba Interim Administration and led by the region's incumbent president, Ahmed Mohamed Islam. The regional president will serve as the chairperson of a new Executive Council, to which he will appoint three deputies. Management of Kismayo's seaport and airport will also be transferred to the Federal Government after a period of six months, and revenues and resources generated from these infrastructures will be earmarked for Jubaland's service delivery and security sectors as well as local institutional development. Additionally, the agreement includes the integration of Jubaland's military forces under the central command of the Somali National Army (SNA), and stipulates that the Juba Interim Administration will command the regional police. UN Special Envoy to Somalia Ambassador Kay hailed the pact as \\"a breakthrough that unlocks the door for a better future for Somalia,\\" with AUC, UN, EU and IGAD representatives also present at the signing. Garowe bilateral agreement In October 2014, Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed led a federal government delegation to the autonomous Puntland region in northeastern Somalia.

They were received at the Garowe International Airport by senior Puntland leaders, including President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali and Vice President Abdihakim Abdullahi Haji Omar, and subsequently attended a well-organized welcoming ceremony at the Puntland presidential palace in Garowe alongside Ambassador Kay and various other members of the international community. Ahmed subsequently co-chaired a reconciliation conference in the city between the visiting federal officials and Puntland representatives led by President Ali. The three-day meeting concluded with a 12-point agreement between the stakeholders, with UN envoy to Somalia Ambassador Kay, EU Ambassador Michele Cervone d'Urso, IGAD representative Mohamed Abdi Afey, and Ethiopian Consul General Asmalash Woldamirat serving as witnesses. According to federal Minister of Culture and Higher Education Duale Adan Mohamed, the pact stipulates that the recent tripartite agreement between Galmudug and Himan and Heeb establishing a new central regional state within Somalia only applies to the Galguduud and south Mudug provinces. In keeping with a 2013 pact signed by former Prime Minister of Somalia Abdi Farah Shirdon and former Puntland President Abdirahman Mohamed Farole, the Garowe bilateral agreement also states that the Federal and Puntland authorities will work together to form a united and inclusive national army. Additionally, parliamentary committees consisting of Federal and Puntland representatives are mandated with ensuring equitable distribution of foreign assistance and overseeing eventual talks pertaining to the Provisional Constitution. Ambassador Kay welcomed the agreement and urged both parties to work for the public interest, and IGAD representative Afey likewise hailed the reconciliation effort.

He led a popular uprising against the established authorities of London, and was imprisoned by Henry III when he resumed power in 1265. Background Fitzthomas was born into the ruling elite of thirteenth century London, and was a member of the Drapers' Guild. At that time the city, with a population of around 100,000 was governed by a council of 24 aldermen. The details of his precise biography are not known, but he became and alderman in the 1240s, and served as Sheriff 1257-8. He was appointed Mayor of London in 1261 (the title of the office later was changed to Lord Mayor in the 14th century). He lived in a mansion at Cornhill. Revolutionary Role In 1263, when De Monfort's forces advanced on London, Fitzthomas led a popular uprising in support of the Barons. He governed through a renewal of the traditional folkmoot form of government, bypassing the elite of aldermen. He publicly endorsed the Provisions of Oxford, the constitutional changes being demanded by the baronial party. Aftermath and death Following the defeat of De Montfort and the barons at Evesham in 1265, Fitzthomas was imprisoned by the then Prince Edward. Even then he remained popular, and there were demands in 1266 for his restoration to the mayoralty. He was released in 1268 and paid a substantial fine of ¬£500.

The study of trust that develops between the photographer and the sitter and the exploration of the power of the photographic medium on people, are both fundamental vectors in his artistic quest. His photographs often addresses subtle and relevant questions on social, political and cultural issues, such as the relationship with nudity, religion, the environment, war or the fragility of life. His works are mainly sketches that avoid unnecessary detail. He is a fourth-generation photographer. Early life Badessi the son of French photographer Elie Badessi and Catalan Maria Louisa Rovira Font was raised in France. Badessi was first interested in painting and filmmaking, but at the age of fifteen, he chose photography as his chief form of artistic expression. While studying language and communication sciences with a focus on journalism and advertising at the Universit√© des Lettres in Avignon, he experimented with photography. He spent hours taking photos of people and soon, started to draw attention to his work by winning prestigious photography contests such as the Guy Laroche Drakkar Prize. Before moving to Paris, Badessi's first noteworthy photograph was published in Paris's Vogue Hommes magazine. The black-and-white portrait was exhibited as part of the Cond√© Nast retrospective at the Centre Photographique et d'Audiovisuel de la Ville de Paris (1986), along with photographs by Irving Penn, Bruce Weber, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Annie Leibovitz that had been taken throughout the years for the company's various prestigious titles. Early career Badessi became fascinated with the interaction that develops between the photographer and the sitter during a photo session, as well as the psychological impact of the photography medium on the sitter. In order to deepen his study of these two observations, he decided to move to Paris in the mid-1980s and enrolled in a class of photography at the Universit√© de Paris VIII. For his M.A. thesis, he created a project entitled \\"Ethnological Fashion Photography\\" whose focus was to study the impact of photography on a relatively unexplored terrain, using clothing as the main communication tool with his subjects. Using the method of \\"La photographie n√©goci√©es\\" (Negotiated Photography) introduced to him by photographer/teacher Michel S√©m√©niako, Badessi, spent several months over the course of two years (1987‚Äì1988), in Niger, Africa, taking photographs and studying the impact of the medium on isolated tribes, that had never or very rarely been exposed to photography. He was able to finance this project thanks to the prominent \\"Bourse de l'aventure\\" prize that he won (1988), which was funded by several sponsors including Fuji Color, VSD magazine, and France Inter. Soon, Badessi's well-polished and unique images started to be seen frequently in photography magazines and exhibitions. It did not take long before he was hired to create images for advertising high-end fashion brands and perfumes. Thanks to these commercial assignments, Badessi has a steady income at an early age and was able to pursue his artistic quest and further explore the photography medium around the world. Career To expend his career, Badessi moved to the United States in the early 1990s. Dividing his time between commercial and personal work, he began focusing on artistic nudes, which he had already experimented with during his early stages behind the camera. Since nude work requires the deepest degree of trust between the photographer and the sitter, he felt that this phase was necessary to further evaluate the psychological impact of photography on people. In addition to his primary focus, Badessi was also interested in the relationship that builds between the photographer and the model during a nude photo-session. Badessi has always been spiritually close to nature. Before the organic products trend, he was well aware that we should respect our environment because we are part of it. He believes that whatever we do badly to nature will come back to us at some point. In between assignments and with this philosophy in mind, Badessi dedicated ten years taking nudes in dramatic landscapes, showing how close we are to nature. In 2000, the prestigious Swiss publishing company Edition Stemmle, released his first book, SKIN, which featured a foreword written by Sondra Gilman, Founder and Chairperson of the photography committee at the Whitney Museum in New York. A few solo shows presenting some of this work had previously taken place in Paris, but in the years to follow the publication of the book, more exhibitions opened in the United States and abroad. At the same time, his photographs became part of numerous important collections and he received several prestigious awards and grants. During this transitional phase of his career, Badessi decided to focus on the fine art aspects of photography and only accepted commercial assignments that would grant him total control over the images. The campaign he produced for Charles Jourdan (2004) is the perfect example of Badessi's desire to create and nurture an image from its concept to its final phase. The success of the Charles Jourdan project was a great challenge, because for two decades, Guy Bourdin had generated a large amount of stunning photographs for the brand that have become iconic images. To bring his own vision, Badessi played with eroticism and mythological symbolism, creating memorable visuals that are in the permanent collection of le Mus√©e de la Publicit√© ‚Äì Les Arts D√©coratifs in Paris. That same year, one of the photographs \\"The Abduction of Ganymede 1\\" made the headlines for an article in the New York Times. Focusing on his artistic undertakings considerably boosted Badessi's desire to get closer and closer to total artistic freedom. Being politically correct‚Äîwhich was a key factor during so many years of working for important brands‚Äîwas no longer an issue, and he could now translate what he would observe in this world into images without restraint. Following that philosophy, Badessi created \\"American Dream, This is not a dream\\" (2006) a series of portraits based on the propagandist campaigns elaborated in the United States to attract new recruits during the Iraq War. The project was acclaimed abroad and widely collected, but seen as too controversial in the States at the time because of the tense relationship between many military families and the Government, as a result, the series was not widely exhibited in the States. \\"American Dream, This is not a dream\\" was later selected for the prestigious Arte Laguna Prize and shown at the Venetian Arsenal (2011).  The unavoidable temporality of existence  Badessi‚Äîwho had mainly taken photographs of people during his career‚Äîdecided to work on a new series called \\"The unavoidable temporality of existence\\", that would not feature people. For this series he set a goal to use inexpensive material to produce images that addressed some laws of physics. Specifically, he focused on laws relative to light, such as the phenomenon of the reflection of color onto a surface. Relying on the ability to freeze time‚Äîan important characteristic of the photography medium‚ÄîBadessi produced weightless sculptures made of aluminum sheets, which appeared sturdy once photographed. These compositions, which recall the work of artists such as John Chamberlain or C√©sar Baldaccini, introduced the notions of chaos, balance, and duality between the fragile and the strong. This undertaking was a way for him to spend time in the studio, experimenting with the fundamental properties of the medium, like he did for hours as an adolescent. This was also a time for him to reflect on the memories of his carefree childhood chasing butterflies in the beautiful landscapes of Provence. This time, as an adult, Badessi's aim was to use the butterfly as a positive and symbolic element to approach a serious topic: The temporality of all things in life. The project that Badessi has been working on in relation to this theme is titled \\"Innocence\\". This series has been in production since 2009. Badessi's newest project, \\"Confessions\\", is due to be released in 2014. Exhibitions Badessi has had solo exhibitions in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Miami, London, Milan, Rome, Paris, Nice, Barcelona, Monaco.

His great grandfather, Cesare Badessi, was an Italian artist who specialized in fresco painting. To explore the \\"New World\\", he moved to Brazil where some of his relatives had emigrated from Italy. For several years, he decided to put painting on the side to take part in the family business, which spanned from banking to coffee exploitations and diamond mining. To resume his painting career, he moved back to Europe and started to practice photography in the late part of the 1800s. At the time, photography was a fairly new medium and was promising to become the alternative to painting. It was starting to open portraiture to an entirely new audience. With a prominent banker as business partner, he opened a photo studio in one of the most fashionable streets of Lisbon, Portugal where he took portraits of the well to do. Miguel Angelo Badessi (Laurent Elie Badessi's grandfather), son of Cesare Badessi, was born in Porto in 1904. In 1923, the entire family moved to Paris, France, for political reasons. There were 10 siblings in the Badessi family and all pursued careers in painting, sculpture or photography. Miguel Angelo Badessi was 19 years old when he arrived in Paris and quickly picked up the art of photography, as he wanted the follow the footsteps of his father and his older siblings. In 1924, at the age of 20, he started to work as a photographer for one of the most important photo studios of the time, Manuel Fr√®res. Later on, he worked in several of the other prestigious Parisian photo studios Lorelle, Saad, and Piaz that mainly focused on high fashion, celebrities and movie stars. It was at Studio Piaz in the late 1930s that he met his future wife Raymonde Feug√®re a photographer who was the daughter of photographer Jules Feug√®re. While working at Studios Manuel Fr√®res, Raymonde Feug√®re met Germaine Hirschefeld, known as Cosette Harcourt, who was taking care of the appointments for sittings of the celebrities. Cosette Harcourt created the Studio Harcourt in 1934 with the brothers Lacroix. They hired a part of the Manuel Fr√®res team and Raymonde Badessi joined the newly opened studio, which quickly became extremely famous for celebrity portraiture. Miguel Angelo Badessi and Raymonde Badessi were married in 1938 while working together at Studio Piaz. Shortly after, they opened their own studio in the XIV arrondissement of Paris. They had one son Elie Badessi (Laurent Elie Badessi's father) who was born in Paris in 1942. He became also a photographer and worked in the family business. In 1957, looking to escape the fast-paced Parisian lifestyle, the Badessis acquired the renowned establishments Studios Ch√¢teauneuf and settled in the south of France.

Furthermore, a debtor must not have any agreements mandated under the instant Act, be bankrupt, nor have accumulated 25% or more of their total debt during the previous 6 months.  Role of Personal Insolvency Practitioners  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 envisages that Personal Insolvency Arrangements can only be applied for through an approved third party, termed a Personal Insolvency Practitioner. The practitioners must be authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and include Solicitors Barristers, Qualified accountants, qualified financial advisers etc. As of 31 October 2013, there were a total of 72 registered Personal Insolvency Practitioners.  Debts covered under the agreement  The type of debts that can be included in a PIA are split into three types; Included, Excludable, and Excluded. * Included Debts :* Housing loans on the principal private residence :* Loans on investment property :* Mortgages/loans on buy- to-let properties :* Personal guarantees :* Personal loans :* Credit Union loans :* Business/commercial loans :* Credit card balances :* Store cards balances :* Overdrafts * Excludable debt (debts that can only be included with creditor consent) :* Any taxes, duties, or levies owed or require payment to the State :* Local government charges :* Local authority rates :* Anything owed under the Nursing Home Support Scheme :* Annual service charges payable to apartment and housing estate management companies :* Any debts incurred under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 * Excluded Debts (debts that cannot be included) :* Court ordered family maintenance payments :* Court fines arising from criminal offenses :* Debts arising from personal injury or wrongful death court-awarded claims :* Debts incurred from fraudulent loans  Agreement processes authorized under the Act   Debtor insolvency declaration  Initially, the debtor is required to provide a PIP with a full disclosure of his or her financial situation. After appraisal, the PIP suggests best possible agreement. If recommended, the debtor can proceed with the PIA application and appoint the PIP to act on their behalf. A Prescribed Financial Statement is then prepared for the debtor that details key information about a debtor‚Äôs finances and clearly shows their insolvent status. It must be fully supported by appropriate financial documentation, such as pay slips, bank statements, etc. The debtor makes a statutory declaration in the presence of witnesses to confirm the Prescribed Financial Statement is true and accurate, and completes and signs the additional documents needed to accompany the Statement to apply for a Protective Certificate. The full application is sent to the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI).  Issuance of Protective Certificate  A court is authorized to issue a Protective Certificate to the debtor, which provides PIP giving the debtor 70 days protection from creditors in which they can prepare a PIA proposal.  Preparation of PIA proposal  After issuance of the Protective Certificate, the PIP is mandated to prepare a draft PIA. During the process, the market value of the secured assets can either be agreed between the debtor, creditor and PIP or the services of an independent valuer can be solicited.  Creditors' meeting and approval of PIA  After the debtor agrees to the PIA proposal, the PIP is required to call a creditors' meeting in which, through voting, creditors representing at least 65% of the total debts must agree to the proposal, including creditors representing not less than 50% of the unsecured debt and not less than 50% of the secured debt. After acceptance through the vote, the documents are required to be forwarded to ISI, which will notify the Circuit Court. Thus final approval sits with the court, and any creditor's objection will be considered by them. The law requires that after approval the debtor‚Äôs name, address details, birth year, and PIA start date are made available on the ISI website.  Execution of PIA  After formal approval by the courts and notification with ISI, debtors are required to make payments to the PIP, which in turn distributes the payments to creditors as per agreements. A PIA has a lifespan of six years. = Completion = If a debtor completes all of their obligations under the PIA, the agreement is considered complete. At completion, the PIP through creditors finalizes the treatment of the remaining debt balances: unsecured debt balances will be written off, while secured debt balances are discharged as per the PIA agreement. The PIP coordinates the removal of the debtor‚Äôs information from the Register of Personal Insolvency Arrangements within three months, making the debtor solvent. = Failure = A PIA will be deemed to have failed if creditors do not agree to the PIA or if the debtor fails to maintain his or her duties and obligations. This can be avoided if a debtor can anticipate a potential problem keeping up with payments, because their PIP may be able to arrange a variation with creditors to ensure a way can be found to continue with the PIA and prevent it from failing.  Insolvency agreements in the UK  In the UK, a similar arrangement exists under the name of individual voluntary arrangement (IVA). IVA has been mandated under the Insolvency Act 1986.

The narrative is partly autobiographical and set in Lyon in the 1920s. It follows two young men who are in love with the same woman; one of them is to become a Jesuit priest, while the other‚Äîthe author's alter ego‚Äîis a fierce agnostic. Rebatet began to write the novel in 1942 and continued to write it in the Sigmaringen enclave, where he fled together with the Vichy government in 1944. In 1946 he was sentenced to death for his sympathy for National Socialism and collaboration during the war, but the penalty was commuted to forced labour the next year. He finished the novel in prison before he was released in 1952. The novel was published in two volumes, with 496 and 519 pages respectively. Reception The novel has been praised by a large number of French-language writers, critics and intellectuals, such as Roger Nimier, Antoine Blondin, Jean Paulhan, √âtiemble, Pol Vandromme, Jos√© Cabanis, Jean Dutourd, George Steiner, Anne Desclos, Jean Duvignaud and Marc- √âdouard Nabe. Several of them have named it as one of the greatest novels of the post-war era, but it is also controversial due to the writer's background. Pascal Alain Ifri, professor of French at the Washington University in St. Louis, wrote in his monograph about the novel: \\"Because of Rebatet's pro- fascist, pro-German and antisemitic positions before and during World War II, notably seen in his virulent pamphlet Les D√©combres, there is, indeed, in the literary and journalist environment, a consensus, which was set at the publication of the book and which continues to this day, to keep quiet about Rebatet's novel, and this despite the fact that love, religion and art, and not politics, constitute its principal themes.\\" References ;Notes ;Bibliography * External links * Publicity page at √âditions Gallimard's website 1952 French novels Novels set in Lyon French autobiographical novels French-language novels Novels set in France Novels set in the 1920s √âditions Gallimard books ","title":"Les Deux √âtendards"},{"id":"41248927","text":"Swan House, 17 Chelsea Embankment in 2011 Swan House, 17 Chelsea Embankment Architect R.

Built in 1876 by the architect Richard Norman Shaw, architecturally it is relevant both to the Queen Anne Revival and to the Arts and Crafts movement. It was built by Shaw for the artistic patrons Wickham and Elizabeth Flower.

In 1892, the journal The British Architect hailed Swan House and its neighbours as \\"some of the finest specimens of modern domestic architecture in London.\\" The building owes its name to its location on the site of what was an inn named The Swan. Creating some confusion, now it is the newer, current structure, rather than the long- destroyed inn that is frequently called the Old Swan House.

The house built in 1875-76 made a home for solicitor and art collector Wickham Flower and his artist wife Elizabeth. Norman Shaw, known for the Piccadilly Hotel in Piccadilly Circus, Cragside in Northumberland and Lowther Lodge in Kensington, now headquarters of the Royal Geographical Society, served as the architect. Shaw designed the lower part of the building in the Queen Anne Revival style popular during the Victorian Era. He incorporated bay windows on the second floor and dormer windows at the top floor for an unusual look. On the third floor, Shaw alternated flat narrow windows with caged oriel windows. In 1892, The British Architect hailed Swan House and the six other homes Shaw designed in the Chelsea Embankment as \\"masterpieces.\\" Wickham Flower hired the firm of designer William Morris to decorate Swan House. Flower also bought two pieces from his good friend, American expatriate artist James Whistler ‚Äî Sweet Shop - Note in Orange and Sun Cloud ‚Äî to display in his home. The four-storey building with basement and dormers was listed as a Grade II building on 24 June 1954. Beginning in 1985, Swan House was an architectural studio and office space for many years. After undergoing a 10-year renovation, Swan House was put on sale as a private home in 2007 for ¬£32 million. The home has a 44-by-18-foot ballroom, a cinema and a basement pool.

Life  Carlone was born some time before 1607, from a family of builders and later Burgers of Leoben. He probably began his career in 1625 as an assistant to his father. Stories about his being involved in disturbances and serving a jail term as a youth are not clearly documented. In 1631 Carlone was resident in R√∂thelstein, where in 1650 he was described as a master stonemason. He worked among other projects on abbey buildings in Gurk (1637) and G√∂ss (from 1652). In 1671 an order for sheet copper shows he was in Passau, in 1677 he was in Garsten, Judenburg and Seckau. In 1678 he was again in Garsten, where he made the designs for his sons to build the monastery church (1685‚Äì1693). Pietro Francesco Carlone died in Garsten. The year of his death is disputed, with different sources giving 1680, 1681 or 1682. He had followed the footsteps of his father, from whom he had learned the craft. In the same way he brought his children into his building company. They first worked as his assistants, later as employees and representatives of the enterprise, and continued the business after his death. Descendants  *Carlo Antonio Carlone (Born 1635 in Scaria, Lombardy, Italy, died May 3, 1708 in Passau), his father's assistant from 1651, in 1661 was an abbey builder in Seckau, then worked according to the plans of the Father, and later as an independent builder. He was the architect of St. Florian Monastery. *Giovanni Battista Carlone (c. 1640/1642 ‚Äì c. 1717 ), worked with his father and brother at the Garsten Abbey church, among other projects. * Bartholomeo Carlone Work  Pietro Francesco Carlone was mainly committed to abbey building. He worked during the Counter-Reformation and revival of the Catholic Church, undertaking work for the Jesuit order (1568‚Äì1584) using the architecture of baroque churches throughout Europe as a model. Like other builders and stucco- workers in his family, including his generation and the next, Carlone built in the so-called \\"Jesuit style\\". However, the Carlones in Austria followed the spread in northern Italy of the pilaster style of church with galleries, barrel vault, straight chancel without transept and twin-tower facade. The innovative element of \\"Carlone\\" churches is not so much the design, but rather the opulent splendor of the stucco decorations. The first buildings associated with the name of Pietro Francesco Carlone are the chapel dedicated to St. Sebastian in Frohnleiten in 1625, and a bathhouse created in 1631 for the Congregation of the Jesuits in Leoben. Chapter tract of the pin in Gurk (1637/38) Cloister (1637‚Äì1638) at the Gurk Cathedral In 1637 Pietro Francesco Carlone laid the blueprint of the buildings for the Cathedral chapter to be built to the north of the transept of the Gurk Cathedral. This was built in 1637‚Äì38 to replace the former abbey buildings of Gurk. The builder incorporated existing structures in the work, which was purely functional and largely dispensed with artistic design. This was followed by an imperial hunting lodge (1639) near the Leopoldsteinersee and work on the water works (1644) in Innerberg, now Eisenerz. G√∂ss Abbey in Leoben (1652‚Äì1654) Carlone was commissioned in 1650 with construction of the huge \\"Upper Convent\\" in the northwest of the church of the Benedictine G√∂ss Abbey in Leoben. At that time it was under the direction of the Abbess Amalia von Leisser. The groundbreaking ceremony took place in 1652 and the work was completed in 1654. In 1827 the building came into the possession of the wheelwrights' co-operative of Vordernberg. Saint George's Abbey, L√§ngsee (1654-1658/1659) Southern Patio in Saint George's Abbey, L√§ngsee Carlone converted Saint George's Abbey, L√§ngsee, into Baroque style in the years 1654‚Äì1658, with the exception of the tower, which was built in 1676. Parish Church of St. Magdalena in Trag√∂ss (1658) In 1658, Pietro Francesco Carlone built the choir and side chapels of the parish church of St. Magdalena in Trag√∂√ü-Oberort in Bruck an der Mur. He had given an estimate for the work in 1640. Seckau Abbey (1658‚Äì1679) Seckau Abbey Carlone was employed for a long period at Seckau Abbey. There he adopted the Baroque style for the expansion that had begun in 1625 on the western front. The Imperial Hall, completed in the year 1640, was decorated with rich stucco work in 1660 in preparation for a visit of the Emperor Leopold I. A year later the east, south and west wings were completed. The west facade and the towers of the Romanesque abbey church were transformed in the years 1671‚Äì1677. Carlone worked until 1679 at Seckau Abbey. That year he received compensation for his work over 18 years. More than half of the buildings were demolished in 1832. The western fa√ßade and the towers were renovated in the 19th Century in the Romanesque Revival style. Abbey church in Garsten (from 1677) The church of the former Benedictine monastery was based on a design by Carlone using the Jesuit church in Linz as a model. Designed and finished by his sons Carlo Antonio and Giovanni Battista, it was said to have one of the most magnificent interiors of the late Austro-Italian Baroque. Abbey Church in Schlierbach (1680‚Äì1683) The plans for the new church of the Cistercian Schlierbach Abbey were supplied by Carlone, and the work was executed by his son Carlo Antonio (according to other sources the two brothers shared the work.) Other members of the Carlone family, Giovanni Battista or Bartolomeo, created the stucco and frescoes in 1684‚Äì85. Carlo Antonio Carlone made the design for the altar. Attributed work Francis Xavier Parish in Leoben (1660‚Äì1665) The church, an impressive monument of the Counter-Reformation, is one of the early churches of Styria that uses the pilaster style later magnificently developed in the Carlone churches of the Frauenberg Sanctuary of Admont Abbey, Schlierbach and Garsten. It is assumed despite lack of archival evidence that this important building in Leoben dates back to Pietro Francesco Carlone, whose father had already settled in Leoben. Old Cathedral in Linz (1678) Old Cathedral, Linz, attributed to Carlone The Jesuit church of St. Ignatius in Linz, known as the Old Cathedral, Linz, whose shell was completed in 1678, is also attributed to Pietro Francesco Carlone. St. Michael's Church, Passau (1677) St. Michael's Church, Passau was built after the fire in 1662 of the Church and Jesuit College. The new church was already completed in 1677. Pietro Francesco Carlone is considered the architect based on stylistic evidence. The interior has a simple pilaster layout. Parts of the building indicate stucco workers from the Carlone enterprise.

His grandson was the oligarch Matthew III Cs√°k.Mark√≥ 2006, p. 351. Family He was born into the Cs√°k clan from unknown parents, as a result there is an inability to connect the Trencs√©n branch to the other branches of the clan. In 1235, when he was first mentioned by contemporary records, Matthew had already begun his political career as a well-known member of junior king B√©la's court, therefore it was not necessary to distinguish him from the other lords by specifying the name of his father.Krist√≥ 1986, p. 28. Matthew I married Margaret from an unidentified family. The marriage produced five children (four sons and a daughter): the eldest one was Mark I, isp√°n (comes) of Hont County in 1247, but there is no further information about him; Stephen I, master of the stewards from 1275 to 1276 and from 1276 to 1279; Matthew II, a notable general and palatine of Hungary (1278‚Äì1280; 1282‚Äì1283); and Peter I, who also held powerful positions, including palatine (1275‚Äì1276; 1277; 1278; 1281) and who, furthermore, was the father of the notorious Matthew III.Krist√≥ 1986, p. 31. They had also a daughter, who married to the Moravian noble Zdislav Sternberg, a loyal bannerman of the Cs√°k clan.Krist√≥ 1986, p. 50. Their son, Stephen Sternberg (or \\"the Bohemian\\") later inherited the Cs√°k dominion because of the absence of a direct adult male descendant after the death of Matthew III in 1321.Krist√≥ 1986, p. 199. After Matthew I's death, his wife, Margaret joined the Dominican monastery at the 'Rabbits' Island and lived there until her death. Career During the rule of Andrew II of Hungary, he supported the crown prince, when B√©la's relation with his father became even worse. The king entrusted his son with the government of Transylvania with the title of duke. After the death of Andrew II on 21 September 1235, B√©la ascended the throne without any opposition and Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom crowned him on 14 October in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. On the same day, Matthew I was appointed master of the stewards, one of the great offices in the Kingdom of Hungary.Krist√≥ 1986, p. 26. During the first years of B√©la IV, a new aristocracy arose, whom the king could rely on. B√©la's main purpose was to restore the royal power that had weakened during his father's rule; e.g., he ordered the burning of his advisors' seats, because he wanted to force them to stand in the presence of the king. As he also wanted to strengthen the position of the towns, he confirmed the charter of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and granted new privileges to several key towns in the kingdom. Furthermore, B√©la dismissed his father's former loyal followers and advisors (during this time, for example, former palatines Denis, son of Ampud was blinded and Julius K√°n was imprisoned). That consideration explains Matthew's rise in a short time from obscurity to the largest positions. He held the office at least until 23 September 1241. Besides that, he also functioned as isp√°n of Temes (1235‚Äì1238) and Nyitra Counties (1240‚Äì1242).Zsoldos 2011, p. 54. Following the disastrous Battle of Mohi (11 April 1241), B√©la IV fled the scene to Spalato (today: Split, Croatia), where Matthew I was also a member of the king's men.Krist√≥ 1986, p. 27. After the Mongol invasion of Hungary, Matthew I was appointed master of the treasury, thus he became responsible for the royal's economic and financial affairs. Beside that position, he was also isp√°n of Sopron (1242) and Pozsony Counties (1242‚Äì1245).Zsoldos 2011, p. 62. B√©la IV donated Chren√≥c (; today part of Chrenovec-Brusno) in Nyitra County to Matthew I in 1243. One year later he acquired the estate of Pruszka (today: Prusk√©, Slovakia) in Trencs√©n County, which previous landowner died without heirs. Later Matthew I exchanged that land to Tunig, Pozsony County. According to a royal charter issued in 1249, B√©la IV formerly also donated Racsic (; today part of Nitrica) to Matthew, who was already dead by that time.Krist√≥ 1986, p. 28. There is no source about his inherited possessions, thus data on his four sons' inherited estates also does not exist. Consequently, he did not initiate his family through the establishment of oligarchical power with land acquisitions, he just marked its direction (from the ancient estates of the genus in Fej√©r County to northwest).Krist√≥ 1986, p. 30. Matthew I Cs√°k was last mentioned by sources on 12 December 1245. As it's written above, he had already died by 1249, according to the king's diploma. In contrast his widow, Margaret, who lived in the 'Rabbits' Island for a long time, claimed in 1276 that she was 51 years old and her husband died 22 years ago, so in 1254. The royal charter, however, is a more reliable source, because medieval people found the years and times difficult to keep track. References Sources * Krist√≥, Gyula (1986).

The Act defined the boundaries of the two states, determined how the assets and liabilities were to be divided, and laid out the status of Hyderabad as the permanent capital of new Telangana state and temporary capital of the Andhra Pradesh state. An earlier version of the bill, Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2013, was rejected by the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly on 30 January 2014. The 2014 bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on 18 February 2014 and in the Rajya Sabha on 20 February 2014. The bill was attested by the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee on 1 March 2014 and published in the official Gazette on 2 March 2014, where as 2 June 2014 is the 'appointed day' according to the act. The new states were created on 2 June 2014.  Legislative history  The Union Cabinet formed a Group of Ministers (GoM) committee in August 2013 led by the Union Home Minister, Sushil Kumar Shinde to look into the suitability of a division of Andhra Pradesh. The members included the Finance Minister, P. Chidambaram, Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, Petroleum Minister & Natural Gas Minister Veerappa Moily, Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh and minister of state in PMO Narayanaswamy. It also took the Srikrishna committee on Telangana into account. A no-confidence motion against the Congress government was submitted to the speaker of the house Meira Kumari by Congress MPs from Andhra Pradesh making the sitting government a minority government was rejected by the speaker. Amidst a lot of protest in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament of India), the bill was introduced by the speaker Meira Kumar at 12:00 pm on 13 February 2014. During this time, there was a lot of shouting of slogans and disruption of proceedings by the Seemandhra (non-Telangana) MPs in the parliament who were determined to stop the bill. The Indian National Congress party MP's attacked the anti-Telangana protestors, and the MP Lagadapati Rajagopal used pepper spray in the parliament. Later he said he was attacked by some Congress MPs from other states and had to use it in self- defense. The parliament was then adjourned at 12:05 pm to 02:00 pm. The leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said she did not know if the bill was introduced. On 18 February 2014, the Telangana Bill was passed by the Voice Vote in the Lok Sabha with support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while the live telecast of the House was cut off and the doors and galleries were sealed. The Seemandhra leaders accused the United Progressive Alliance government of having taken it up for electoral gains and said it was a \\"black day\\" for the Indian parliament. On 20 February, the Telangana bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha (the higher house of parliament) with support from the BJP. MPs from various parties asked for division but it was rejected by the speaker. Finally, the bill was passed by a voice vote. The bill received the assent of the President and published in the Gazette on 1 March 2014. The new State came into effect \\"from the date set by the central government also known as appointed date.\\" It became the 29th state of India.  Suspension of members of parliament  Due to disruptions to the House, Meira Kumar suspended 18 MPs from Andhra Pradesh on 13 February 2014 for the rest of the session. They included 11 MPs of the Congress party (Sabbam Hari, Anantha Venkatarami Reddy, Rayapati Sambasiva Rao, S. P. Y. Reddy, M. Sreenivasulu Reddy, V. Aruna Kumar, A. Sai Prathap, Suresh Kumar Shetkar, K. R. G.vasi akash Kanumuri and G. Sukhender Reddy), three MPs of the Telugu Desam party (Niramalli Sivaprasad, Nimmala Kristappa, and K. Narayana Rao), two MPs of YSR Congress (Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy and M. Rajamohan Reddy), and two other MPs from the Telangana region.  Resolution for the united Andhra Pradesh in Assembly  Though only an opinion is required under Article 3 of the Indian Constitution, a resolution was adopted and the bill was rejected by the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly and Council on 30 January 2014. Only 119 out of 294 MLAs in state assembly are from Telangana. Non-Telangana MLAs opposed the bill. This was the first instance a state was re-organized after a state clearly expressed an opinion against the re-organization in Indian history.  Petitions against the Bill in Supreme Court  Nine petitions were filed in the Supreme Court of India requesting a stay of the tabling of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill in parliament. The court rejected the pleas saying, \\"We do not think this is the appropriate stage for us to interfere\\". They would only consider the petition if the bill was passed in parliament. But the court issued notices to the centre regarding the issue on 7 March 2014. The apex court would take up the issue on 5 May 2014. The next hearing in the Supreme Court was scheduled for 20 August 2014 One petitioner approached the Supreme Court praying that the parliament does not have the power either under Articles 3, 4(2) or any other provision of the Constitution of India to divide a state except by an appropriate amendment of the Constitution under article 368 and with the unanimous consent of the people of the affected State or States. While invoking Articles 2 & 3, the deemed constitutional amendment provision under article 4 (2) of the constitution bypassing Article 368 was said to be invalid after the 24th amendment in 1971. The law ministry of the union government considered bringing appropriate amendments (including constitutional amendments) to the Act to bring legality to it. The common high court of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states stated that the division of the high court located at Hyderabad can only be done with the formation of separate high court for Andhra Pradesh located in that state as per section 31 of the Act. A separate high court for Telangana can not be formed by dividing the present common high court as the existing high court at Hyderabad would become high court of Telangana state after the formation of one for Andhra Pradesh. On the applicability of the section 47 of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Supreme Court in its judgement clarified the manner the financial assets and liabilities of undivided state departments and corporations are to be shared between the new states. In an effort to avoid the huge financial burden to finance the creation of many institutions in the truncated AP state, the affidavit of central government clinched the dispute against the Telangana state AP state also decided to approach Supreme Court regarding the discriminatory sharing of commercial taxes income and refunds under sections 50, 51 and 56 of the act. The state is weary of centres inaction for a long time to amend these sections such that AP state would not loose INR 36 billions.  Details of the Bill  The bill was introduced on 5 December 2013, the first day of the winter session in the Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh. The Union cabinet approved formation of Telangana with ten districts. Hyderabad will remain as the common capital under the Governor's supervision for not more than ten years. A new capital city for Andhra Pradesh would be declared in 45 days. The Bill was drafted based on the boundaries of the proposed Telangana State as approved by the Union Cabinet in its meeting on 3 October 2013. The new state of Telangana would have 119 elected members of its legislative assembly, 40 members of its legislative council, 17 members of the Lok Sabha and 7 members in the Rajya Sabha. The residuary state of Andhra Pradesh would have 175 elected MLAs, 50 MLCs, 25 MPs of Lok Sabha and 11 MPs of Rajya Sabha. There would be a common High Court and its expenditure would be apportioned between the two successor states based on population ratio until a separate court was set up under Article 214 for the residuary state of Andhra Pradesh. The existing Public Service Commission would be the Public Service Commission for the residuary state of Andhra Pradesh and the Union Public Service Commission would, with the approval of President, act as the Public Service Commission for Telangana. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Government of India would constitute a Krishna River Management Board and a Godavari River Management Board within a period of 60 days from the date of coming into force of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill. The Boards would be responsible for the administration, regulation and maintenance of the head works of the dams, reservoirs or head works of canals, as notified by the Government of India on Krishna and Godavari rivers, to implement all the awards made by the Tribunals. The Boards would be responsible for making an appraisal of proposals for construction of new projects on Krishna and Godavari rivers and give technical clearance. While not agreeing for the fresh water allocation of Krishna river among all the four riparian states, the extended Justice Brijesh Kumar tribunal ruled that the water sharing between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states would be finalised project wise from the water allocations made to erstwhile Andhra Pradesh state by earlier Bachawat tribunal. It also stated that the primary reason for the division of the erstwhile state was to ‚Äúfulfil the political and democratic aspirations of the people of Telangana region,‚Äù and not inequitable sharing of water. The Governor shall have special responsibility to the security of life, liberty and property of all those who reside in the common capital of Hyderabad. The Governor's responsibility shall extend to matters such as law and order, internal security and safety of all vital installations in the discharge of these functions. This transitory provision shall cease to have effect after a period not exceeding 10 years. The Bill provides for the creation of separate cadres of All India Services in respect of the two states from the appointed day. Advisory Committee(s) would be constituted to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all employees. The Government of India shall help the successor states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in raising additional police forces for maintenance of public order and shall also deploy one additional unit of the force in Hyderabad for a period of five years. The Greyhound training centre in Hyderabad shall function as common training centre for the successor states for three years. In this period of three years, the GoI shall assist the successor state of Andhra Pradesh in setting up a similar training centre for Greyhounds. The existing Greyhound and OCTOPUS forces shall be distributed between the two states. Of the total equity of Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), 51 per cent shall be with Government of Telangana and 49 per cent with Government of India. Existing coal linkages of SCCL shall continue without any change. New linkages shall be allotted to the successor States as per the new coal distribution policy by the Government of India. Allocation of natural gas will continue to be done as per the policies and guidelines issued by the Government of India. The royalties payable on domestic on-shore production of oil and gas shall accrue to the state in which such production takes place. Allocation of power from Central generating stations shall be allocated to the successor states in the ratio of the average of the actual energy consumption of last five years of the relevant Discoms. For a period of 10 years, the successor state that has a deficit of electricity shall have the first right of refusal for the purchase of surplus power from the other state. Later Polavaram ordinance merging the project-affected villages in the residuary Andhra Pradesh state was accepted by the Parliament in July 2014. Seven mandals from Khammam district of Telangana have been transferred to Andhra Pradesh. Four mandals from Bhadrachalam revenue division namely, Chinturu, Kunavaram, Vararamachandrapuram, Bhadrachalam (excluding the Bhadrachalam revenue village) were transferred to East Godavari district. Three mandals from Palvancha revenue division namely, Kukunoor, Velerupadu, Burgampadu (except 12 villages namely, pinapaka, morampalli, banjara, burgampadu, naginiprolu, krishnasagar, tekula, sarapaka, iravendi, motepattinagar, uppusaka, nakiripeta and sompalli), have been added to West Godavari district. This came into force as the 16th Lok Sabha has passed the Polavaram Ordinance Bill with the voice vote on 11 July 2014.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bill-on-polavaram-project-passed- in-ls-amid-protests/article6200711.ece  New capital for residual Andhra Pradesh  On 4 September 2014, then the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Nara Chandrababu Naidu, declared in the Legislative Assembly that the new capital of Andhra Pradesh state would come up in and around in between Guntur and Vijayawada.

One growing subset of this category is the healthcare royalty fund, in which a private equity fund manager purchases a royalty stream paid by a pharmaceutical company to a patent holder. The patent holder can be another company, an individual inventor, or some sort of institution, such as a research university. Royalties are a usage-based payment from one individual or entity to another individual or entity, giving the right to the use of an asset, product, service or idea.  Structure of Royalty Investments  Royalty funds are a specific type of income trust, used for special-purpose finance, created to hold investments or cash flow in operating companies. These funds aren‚Äôt stocks or bonds but a form of investment fund. A royalty fund raises capital in order to purchase the right to a royalty of a product or service. However, unlike many other corporate entities, the profits derived from the royalties aren‚Äôt taxed on a corporate level. These profits are distributed to shareholders in the form of a dividend, which is taxed on the personal income level. By doing so it avoids double taxation, enabling higher returns on dividends. Thus making royalty funds an attractive investment. Royalty funds are structured in a number of ways. A fund can purchase a royalty or a percentage of a royalty from researchers at a university or a corporate entity for examples a Biotech firm, therefore exchanging capital for ownership of the royalty. Alternatively, the fund can act as a private equity vehicle, extending debt or making loans, in exchange for a proportion of the royalty or securing other assets from the institution as collateral. Usually, investments make go to fund a research project or cover costs of a research project. Royalty funds invest in a range of business areas, including, commodities, energy, entertainment, franchise, patents and IP, pharmaceuticals, and other trademark royalties. An example would be a company making an investment into a pharmaceutical company through the acquisition of a healthcare product or service royalty. The operation of the pharmaceutical company continues, as usual, manufacturing and distribution of the products or services. But once the product has been sold a proportion of the profits will go to the fund that purchased the royalty (the amount or percentage will vary between companies based on the acquisition/investment terms). Another example would be the purchase of royalties in the oil and gas industry, where the rights oil wells, oil mines or oil fields are owned by a royalty fund or also known as royalty trust. Other companies perform the operational aspect of extracting the minerals, paying a ‚Äúroyalty‚Äù in order to extract them.  Funds vs. Investment Trust  Investing in composite funds gives an investor the opportunity to gain exposure into foreign markets that they wouldn't be able to do on their own. By investing in a fund and not one particular stock, an investor is able to reduce their level of risk, by spreading their investment over an average number of 50 assets. This increases an investors diversity and reduces the level of risk. This is possible due to the pooling of capital from multiple investors. Fund managers represent the investors and meet with executives and conduct deals. There are two main decisions an investor can make; * Where to invest (emerging markets or global financial companies, commodities, etc.) * How to invest (Open-end fund or Closed-end funds)  Open-end Funds  By making an investment into an open- end fund, you are essentially buying ownership stake into a range of investments managed by the fund manager. The fund manager combines all the investors capital and aims is to increase its value. The share prices will be dependent on the value of the assets held by the fund, divided by the number of outstanding shares. Shares outstanding are all the shares authorized, issued and purchased by investors. However, this sort of fund can cause liquidity issues, if a lot of shareholders decide to withdraw their funds, resulting in a negative effect on the performance of the fund. This also makes open-end funds less suitable for certain assets. For example, in 2007-2008 during the financial crisis, investors lost a lot of capital, because the fund managers weren't able to sell off assets quick enough. The investors capital was stuck in the funds for months.  Closed-end Funds  Like an open-end fund, closed-end funds pool capital from a variety of investors and has a fund manager make investments on their part. Closed-end funds also have a board of directors to provide another level of oversight of the investments made. Fees and charges tend to be lower than open-end funds, which means that; * Fixed pool of assets * Funds performance unaffected by asset flows However, since assets are being bought and sold between investors in the fund prices can be undervalued or overvalued. Meaning that investors could be at an advantage or disadvantage when buying or selling shares. A final overall drawback is that investment funds aren't offered by many platforms, meaning investors would have a hard time finding them.  Benefits & Disadvantages   Benefits  This includes: * High Yield, royalty funds offer attractive yields to investors in comparison to stocks and bonds. High-end royalty funds offer 8-15% in dividends. * Powerful Investment Tool for people who don‚Äôt have the resources or risk tolerance to buy into a certain industry, but wish to invest directly into an industry on a smaller scale. * Tax-Advantage Yield, higher yields as profits don‚Äôt need to be taxed on a corporate level. * No Corporate Taxes, profits are passed onto the holders of the fund and are declared on their individual tax returns. Enables double taxation to be avoided. * Peculiar Tax Credits. For example, tax breaks may be offered if the investment is in a pharmaceutical product that would benefit health care. It is in the government‚Äôs interest to offer such a tax break to boost R&D; of new products that would help the society. * Potential Inflation Hedge. Since investments are made into assets, the inflation of cash would be avoided. However, the asset would need to be non-depreciative, otherwise the investment may not be profitable. * Higher Sales Price, it appeals to companies who want to sell assets producing cash flow, because they have a higher sales price than what is achievable with conventional finance tools.  Disadvantages  This includes: * Sensitive to interest rates. Share prices will decline when interest rates go up and increase when interest rates fall. * Too good to be true. Often referred to as a ‚Äúget rich quick,‚Äù which could indicate that it‚Äôs an industry with quite some risk if you are one wrong side. Additionally, there is no such thing as ‚Äúgetting rich quick,‚Äù good things take time. * Volatile Markets, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, etc. Performance based, an element of high risk = high reward. If a project fails, the outcome would be no revenue and no profit, resulting in a loss. However, if it does succeed the rewards are high. * High level of risk that a royalty/patent won‚Äôt pay off. Because investments are made into researching institutions ahead of time, it can never be certain whether a patent for a pharmaceutical product or potential oil field will actually pay off. * Investments are complex due to the nature of how investments are made. In order for the fund to be successful, it requires a lot of research and in-depth knowledge of the industry. So investment in specific management of analysts, scientists, geologists, etc. is necessary in order for research to be accurate and profitable. The way of investing is also specific, a lot of paperwork and contracts need to be cleared in order for the purchase to go from the researcher to the fund.  Examples in Intangible Asset Finance  Intangible asset finance deals with the financing of intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, intellectual property, reputations, etc. In 2003, the intangible assets economy of the U.S. was estimated at $5 trillion. *Royalty Pharma: (investing in top therapeutics, typically billion dollar blockbusters products.) *PDL BioPharma: (investing mainly in antibody humanization patents and license agreements in different biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.) *Permian Basin Royalty Trust: (leading royalty trust in oil and natural gas, with a market cap of US $790,000,000).  History and Significant transactions  * David Bowie issues Bowie Bonds on future royalty revenues derived from 25 albums recorded before 1990. * In 2000 PDL BioPharma completed a $115 million deal for a single patent from Yale University. The patent claims to cover Stavudine, a nucleoside analog reverse- transcriptase (NARTI) active against HIV. This was the first acquisition ever made of one whole single pharmaceutical patent. * In 2005 UCC Capital Corporation securitization of BDBG generating property right revenues of roughly $53 million. First to be recognized as a ‚Äúwhole company securitization‚Äù containing primarily intangible assets. * 2005 also included the first ever-live Intellectual Property (IP) auction. Launched by Ocean Tomo, the aim was to speed up patent deals by bringing together patent buyers and sellers in a single venue. Its tremendous success monetarily has resulted in further developments, including an online platform, Royalty Exchange where property rights/patents can be sold and bought. * In 2014 Royalty Pharma acquired the royalty stream promised to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation by Vertex Pharmaceuticals on sales of the drug, Kalydeco, for $3.3 billion; the CFF had invested in discovery and development of the drug under the venture philanthropy model, and said it intended to use proceeds from the royalty sale to further invest in treatments for cystic fibrosis.Andrew Pollack for the New York Times.

UHC is an independent government agency that raises funds in order to offer mortgage loans to lower-income people and to provide resources to developers and builders for creating affordable housing projects. It does not receive any funds from the State of Utah and is completely self-supporting via the issuing of tax-exempt bonds and the creation of and selling of mortgage-backed securities to investors. Background Utah legislation established the Utah Housing Corporation, known as the Utah Housing Finance Agency until 2000, in 1975 with the objective of finding a way to provide affordable housing for low-income and moderate-income persons by creating an adequate supply of mortgage loans with reasonable rates. The company first started under the umbrella of the Utah Economic Department then moving to Community and Culture Department; it is now affiliated with the Department of Workforce Services. From its existence, the Utah Housing Corporation has provided financing for more than 65,000 Utah home buyers, 22,500 affordable rental units, and over 7,200 special needs units of housing. To fund itself, the Utah Housing Corporation uses bonds and mortgage- backed securities. UHC issued its very first bond in 1977. The tax law was much simpler back then. In the beginning, it used bonds to finance mostly multi-family units. The program now works more with single family housing. Half of the mortgage loans used to be new homes. Now most loans are for existing homes. Before 1995 the servicing of loans was outsourced to a third party, after 1995 UHC started servicing their own loans. Until 2013, they only used FHA loans, but now they use conventional loans as well. This program has done well over the years in receiving funding to help lower income families. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) was added to TRA86 to provide some balance and encourage investment in multifamily housing for those in need of affordable rental housing options. Over the subsequent 20 years, it has become an extremely effective tool for developing affordable rental housing, but less efficient economically when compared to programmatic approaches. The LIHTC program has helped meet a critical affordable housing shortage by stimulating the production or rehabilitation of nearly 2.4 million affordable homes in Utah since 1986. This helped encourage more people to buy a house and to give the UHC more options to assist them. 2008 housing market crash When the housing market crashed in 2008, tax-exempt bonds switched places with taxable bonds and sold at a higher price. This made it impossible for the corporation to issue more bonds to finance mortgage loans. UHC then switched to a different business model by copying the mortgage bankers. Instead of issuing bonds and using the cash to create a mortgage loan, UHC now borrows the cash (from their own cash reserves) to create mortgage loans, then bundles multiple mortgage loans together and sells them as mortgage-backed securities in order to get their money back and then lend it out again which creates a recurring source of revenue. UHC also offers a down payment assistance loans to help buyers without a down payment. In 2012, Governor Herbert helped announce two new loans to help fulfill Utah Housing‚Äôs mission, one of which is a loan that offers no mortgage insurance to help keep payments lower for borrowers.

In 1906‚Äì07, the interior was substantially redesigned in the Arts and Crafts style by the architect and designer Charles Voysey, for Emslie Horniman, Liberal MP for Chelsea, anthropologist and philanthropist. According to British Listed Buildings, the interior is \\"widely regarded\\" as one of Voysey's finest interiors, both for the quality of its fixtures and fittings and for the ingenuity of its plan. Voysey's work included lining Mrs. Horniman's second floor bedroom in oak, and ensuring that in fitting the bedstead, the writing table, the jewel-safe and the wardrobe, every inch of space was utilised. The cabinets next to the bed were fitted with sliding shelves, so that her morning teatray would be over the bed. In the 1946 film Wanted for Murder, Garden Corner is home to Eric Portman and his mother Barbara Everest. On 13 June 1946, it was opened as the residential Garden Corner Club, run by Lord Willoughby de Broke, Wing Commander William Herbert Wetton and another ex-RAF officer, with an emphasis on offering cars, yachts and aeroplanes for hire to members. It closed in 1949. In September 1999, it was bought unmodernised by businessman Paul Gregg from a member of the Saudi royal family.

Nelson Thornes. General outline Marx and Engels argue that humans distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence; what individuals are coincides with their production in both how and what they produce. The nature of individuals depends on the material conditions determining their production. How far the productive forces of a nation are developed is shown by the degree to which the division of labor has been carried. Also, there is a direct link between division of labor and forms of ownership. The ruling class, in ruling the material force of society, is simultaneously the ruling intellectual force of society. They regulate the production and distribution of ideas of their age. As the ruling class changes with time, so too do the ideals and the new ruling class must instill upon its society its own ideas which will become universal. The ruling ideas are thought to be the universal interest. However, it is an illusion that the ideas of the ruling class are the communal interests. This system will forever remain in place so long as society is organized around the need for a ruling class.Karl Marx. \\"The German Ideology\\". Literary Theory: An Anthology. 2nd ed. Oxford: Blackwell, 1998. 653-658. Print. To illustrate this theoretical framework, Marx draws on his formulation of base and superstructure. Historical development is the reflection of changes in the economic and material relations of the base. When the base changes, a revolutionary class becomes the new ruling class that forms the superstructure. During revolution, the revolutionary class makes certain that its ideas appeal to humanity in general so that after a successful revolution these ideas appear natural and universal. These ideas, which the super-structural elements of society propagate, then become the governing ideology of the historical period. Furthermore, the governing ideology mystifies the economic relations of society and therefore places the proletariat in a state of false consciousness that serves to reproduce the working class.Marx, Karl. ‚ÄúThe German Ideology‚Äù.

The 246th episode of the series overall, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on December 4, 2013. It is the conclusion of a three-episode story arc that began with \\"Black Friday\\", and continued with \\"A Song of Ass and Fire\\". The story centers upon the children of South Park, role-playing as characters from Game of Thrones, split into two factions over whether to collectively purchase bargain-priced Xbox One or PlayStation 4 video game consoles at an upcoming Black Friday sale at the local mall, where Randy Marsh has been made the Captain of mall security. The episode received critical acclaim. Plot In the conclusion of a three-part storyline, the children of South Park are split into two factions over whether to purchase bargain-priced Microsoft Xbox Ones or Sony PlayStation 4s at an upcoming Black Friday sale at the South Park Mall, a schism that sees best friends Stan Marsh (PS4) and Kyle Broflovski (Xbox) on opposite sides. As the PS4 faction turn their attention to the Red Robin restaurant, which serves as a side entrance into the mall, the Xbox One faction arrives to announce they wish to join the PS4 ranks. Though Stan does not trust them, Cartman and Kyle say they have a way to monopolize the Red Robin: by renting it out for a wedding party. Cartman and Stan, who are having a private talk in the \\"Garden of Andros\\", are interrupted by the elderly owner, who informs Stan of the true intentions of the Xbox faction: they have merely feigned surrender in order to lock the PS4 faction in the Red Robin while they retrieve their consoles. Stan is further angered to be told that this was Kyle's idea. To prevent Stan from informing his allies of this, Cartman defecates in the old man's yard and frames Stan for it, resulting in Stan being grounded. When Kyle learns of this, he tries to explain his actions to Stan but he is promptly sent away. As Randy Marsh's mall security guards deal with the increasing shopper violence, George R. R. Martin arrives at the mall to cut the ribbon that will open the mall for the Black Friday sale. However, he stalls by regaling the agitated crowd with musings on his penis. An impatient shopper charges forward, slices off Martin's penis, and cuts the ribbon, allowing the crowd into the mall, leading to mass deaths. In the Red Robin, Kyle, Kenny and their allies turn on Cartman and his faction, revealing that they are no longer Xbox supporters. The standoff is then interrupted by Bill Gates and the head of Sony. The Sony executive is brutally killed by Gates, who announces that Xbox is victorious. The children journey through the blood-and-corpse-covered mall to purchase their Xbox Ones. While playing with his new console, Cartman realizes that he wishes to play outside, saying that their improvised Game of Thrones role-playing over the past few weeks has been filled with so much the drama, action and romance that they do not need Microsoft or Sony to have fun. Production As with the previous episode, the show's opening title sequence is modified to depict the characters in their role-playing garb, while the soundtrack has been altered to include the penis-themed chorus singing to the Game of Thrones opening theme introduced in the previous episode. Series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone said that they experimented with different styles of opening sequences before settling on the penis-themed chorus version; a Japanese Princess Kenny opening sequence was one of the original ideas. Reception \\"Titties and Dragons\\" received widespread critical acclaim. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.0 out of 10, writing, \\"The final chapter of South Parks Black Friday trilogy finished strong, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, subtle commentary and genius satire. There were a few nitpicks‚Äîmost of which were negligible‚Äîbut overall, this week's episode proved that Matt and Trey can still dish out a satisfying multipart arc, with style.\\" Marcus Gilmer of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A‚àí rating, praising the \\"Red Robin Wedding\\", and said, \\"The show‚Äôs ability to inject a bit of soul is one of the best tricks the writers have pulled off regularly throughout the show's run. Beneath all the crude jokes and the potty humor, there's legitimate heart that manages to be genuine and self-aware without ever straying into the maudlin.\\" References External links *\\"Titties and Dragons\\".

Sun Tzu (544‚Äì498 BC), a military strategist, wrote of the superior power of political warfare in battle. Political warfare is the use of political means to compel an opponent to do one's will, based on hostile intent. The term political describes the calculated interaction between a government and a target audience, including another state's government, military, and/or general population. Governments use a variety of techniques to coerce certain actions, thereby gaining relative advantage over an opponent. The techniques include propaganda and psychological operations (PSYOP), which service national and military objectives respectively. Propaganda has many aspects and a hostile and coercive political purpose. Psychological operations are for strategic and tactical military objectives and may be intended for hostile military and civilian populations.Smith, Paul A., On Political War (Washington: National Defense University Press, 1989), p. 7 Political warfare's coercive nature leads to weakening or destroying an opponent's political, social, or societal will, and forcing a course of action favorable to a state's interest. Political war may be combined with violence, economic pressure, subversion, and diplomacy, but its chief aspect is \\"the use of words, images and ideas\\".Smith, p. 3. The creation, deployment, and continuation of these coercive methods are a function of statecraft for nations and serve as a potential substitute for more direct military action.Smith, p. 5 For instance, methods like economic sanctions or embargoes are intended to inflict the necessary economic damage to force political change. The utilized methods and techniques in political war depend on the state's political vision and composition. Conduct will differ according to whether the state is totalitarian, authoritative, or democratic.Smith, p.12 The ultimate goal of political warfare is to alter an opponent's opinions and actions in favour of one state's interests without utilizing military power. This type of organized persuasion or coercion also has the practical purpose of saving lives through eschewing the use of violence in order to further political goals. Thus, political warfare also involves \\"the art of heartening friends and disheartening enemies, of gaining help for one's cause and causing the abandonment of the enemies'\\".Codevilla, Angelo and Paul Seabury, War: Ends and Means (Washington, DC: Potomac Books, Inc., 2006), p. 151. Generally, political warfare is distinguished by its hostile intent and through potential escalation; but the loss of life is an accepted consequence. Tools Peaceful Political warfare utilizes all instruments short of war available to a nation to achieve its national objectives. The best tool of political warfare is \\"effective policy forcefully explained\\",Codevilla and Seabury, p. 157 or more directly, \\"overt policy forcefully backed\\".Angelo M. Codevilla, \\"Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends,\\" in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), 218. But political warfare is used, as one leading thinker on the topic has explained, \\"when public relations statements and gentle, public diplomacy-style persuasion ‚Äì the policies of 'soft power' ‚Äì fail to win the needed sentiments and actions\\" around the world.J. Michael Waller, \\"Getting Serious About Strategic Influence,\\" The Journal of International Security Affairs 17 (Fall 2009): 24. The major way political warfare is waged is through propaganda. The essence of these operations can be either overt or covert. \\"White\\" or overt propaganda comes from a known source. \\"Gray\\" propaganda, on the other hand, is the \\"semiofficial amplification of a government's voice\\". Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are examples of \\"gray\\" propaganda during the Cold War. \\"Black\\" propaganda, however, is propaganda which originates from an unknown source. The key to black propaganda is the fact that it most often \\"appears to come from a disinterested source when in fact it does not\\".Codevilla, p. 219. There are channels which can be used to transmit propaganda. Sophisticated use of technology allows to disseminate information to a vast number of people. The most basic channel is the spoken word. This can include live speeches or radio and television broadcasts. Overt or covert radio broadcasting can be an especially useful tool. The printed word is also very powerful, including pamphlets, leaflets, books, magazines, political cartoons, and planted newspaper articles (clandestine or otherwise). Subversion, agents of influence, spies, journalists, and \\"useful idiots\\" can all be used as powerful tools in political warfare.Codevilla, p. 220. Aggressive Soviet expansion: Formation of the Eastern Bloc Political warfare also includes aggressive activities by one actor to offensively gain relative advantage or control over another. Between nation states, it can end in the seizure of power or in the open assimilation of the victimized state into the political system or power complex of the aggressor. This aggressor-victim relationship has also been seen between rivals within a state and may involve tactics like assassination, paramilitary activity, sabotage, coup d'√©tat, insurgency, revolution, guerrilla warfare, and civil war. *Foreign infiltration or liberation occurs when a government is overthrown by foreign military or diplomatic intervention, or through covert means. The campaign's ultimate purpose is to gain control over another nation's political and social structure. The campaign could be led by the aggressor's national forces or by a political faction favorable to the aggressor within the other state. Paul M. Blackstock describes three stages involved in the extension of control by the aggressor over the victim:Blackstock, Paul W. The strategy of subversion: Manipulating the politics of other nations (Chicago: Quadrangle, 1964), #Penetration or infiltration: the deliberate infiltration of political and social groups within a victim state by the aggressor with the ultimate purpose of extending influence and control. The aggressor conceals its endgame, which goes beyond the normal influential nature of diplomacy and involves espionage.Blackstock, p. 44. #Forced disintegration or atomization: \\"is the breakdown of the political and social structure of the victim until the fabric of national morale disintegrates and the state is unable to resist further intervention\\". The aggressor may exploit the inevitable internal tensions between political, class, ethnic, religious, racial, and other groups.Blackstock, p.50. This concept is a similar strategy to 'divide and conquer'. #Subversion and defection: Subversion is the \\"undermining or detachment of the loyalties of significant political and social groups within the victimized state, and their transference to the political or ideological causes of the aggressor\\".Blackstock, p.56. In lieu of total and direct transference, the aggressor may accept intermediate states that still meets its objectives, such as the favor of politically significant individuals. Furthermore, the formation of a counter-elite, made up of influential individuals and key leaders, within the victim state establishes the legitimacy and permanency of a new regime. Defection is the transference of allegiance of key individuals and leaders to the aggressor's camp. The individual could relocate or stay-in-place in the victim country, continually influencing local issues and events in the aggressor's favor. Defectors also provide insider information to the aggressor.Blackstock, p.61. *Coup d'√©tat is the overthrowing of a government through the infiltration of the political, military, and social groups by a small segment of the state apparatus. The small segment exists within the state and targets the critical political levers of power within a government to neutralize opposition to the coup and post-coup governing force. Several pre-existing factors are necessary for a coup:Luttwak, p. 32-56 political participation being limited to a small portion of the population, independence from foreign power influence and control, and power and decision-making authority concentrated within a political center and not diffused between regional authorities, businesses, or other groups. A coup utilizes political resources to gain support within the existing state and neutralize or immobilize those who are capable of rallying against the coup. A successful coup occurs rapidly and after taking over the government, stabilizes the situation by controlling communications and mobility. Furthermore, a new government must gain acceptance from the public and military and administrative structures, by reducing the sense of insecurity. Ultimately, the new government will seek legitimacy in the eyes of its own people as well as seek foreign recognition.Luttwak, p. 174 The coup d'√©tat can be led by national forces or involve foreign influence, similar to foreign liberation or infiltration. *Paramilitary Operations: transitional political warfare ranging from small-scale use of violence with primitive organizational structure (e.g. sabotage) to full-scale conventional war. The transition and escalation includes a series of stages and depends on tactical and strategic objectives. Paramilitary activities include infiltration and subversion as well as small group operations, insurrection, and civil war.Smith, p.4. *Insurgency: an organized, protracted political warfare tool designed to weaken the control and eliminate the legitimacy of an established government, occupying power, or other political authority.US Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual FM 3‚Äì24 (Department of the Army, December 2006), p. 13. An insurgency is an internal conflict, and the primary struggle is to mobilize local populations for political control and gain popular support towards the insurgents' cause.US Army, p.20. Insurgencies include political and military objectives, with the end goal of establishing a legitimate, rival state structure.Luttwak, p.26. Insurgencies are unconventional military conflicts which incorporate a variety of methods, ranging from coercive tools like intimidation and assassination, to political tools like propaganda and social services. An insurgency's approaches and objectives could involve perpetual disorder and violence demonstrating the government's inability to provide security for the populace, weakening the government and killing or intimidating any effective opposition against the government, intimidating the population and discouraging its participation in ‚Äì or support for ‚Äì political or legal processes, controlling or intimidating police and military forces (which limits their ability to respond to insurgent attacks) or by creating government repression by provoking over-reactions by security or military forces.US Army, p.18,33. In antiquity Constantine (c.337) showing a depiction of his labarum spearing a serpent. Alexander the Great silver tetradrachm. The Chi-Rho symbol The history of political warfare can be traced to antiquity. The Chinese general and strategist Sun Tzu captures its essence in the ancient Chinese military strategy book, The Art of War: \\"So to win a hundred victories in a hundred battles is not the highest excellence; the highest excellence is to subdue the enemy's army without fighting at all...The expert in using the military subdues the enemy's forces without going to battle, takes the enemy's walled cities without launching an attack, and crushes the enemy's state without protracted war.\\"Carr, Caleb, The Book of War: Sun Tzu The Art of Warfare and Karl Von Clausewitz On War (New York: The Modern Library, 2000), p. 79. There are abundant examples of political warfare in antiquity. In ancient Greece, a famous example is that of the Trojan Horse, which used deception for tactical military objectives. Propaganda was commonly utilized, including Greek rhetoric and theatre which used words and images to influence populations throughout the Hellenic world. This practice has left a lasting legacy of speech as a mechanism of political power, greater than force in solving disputes and inducing submission.Smith, p. 35. During this same period, Alexander the Great used coinage imprinted with his own image, indirectly forcing conquered nations to accept his legitimacy as national ruler and to unite disparate nations together under his dominion.Smith, p. 38. Ancient Rome utilized similar political warfare as the Greeks including rhetoric, as displayed by Cicero; and art, as seen in coinage, statues, architecture, engineering, and mosaics. All of these elements were intended to portray Rome's imperial dominance over its subject nations and the superior nature of Roman society.Smith, p. 39. Following a religious vision, the emperor Constantine I in AD 330 bound the Roman state to the universal Christian Church. In doing so, he linked \\"religious commitment with imperial ambition\\" that proved to be quite successful and powerful.Smith, p. 43. One long-lasting symbol of this is the Chi Rho, which forms the first two letters of the Greeks' name for Christ. This symbol was used for over one thousand years by Constantine's successors as a symbol of \\"imperial majesty and divine authority\\"Smith, p. 42. and still is a powerful symbol within Christianity. By country China China's political leaders during this century have had to first create a nation before they could proceed to contend with other national actors in the international arena. Consequently, insofar as both the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang subscribed to a political warfare concept during their formative years of struggle, the concept was as much concerned with creating national identity and defeating domestic adversaries as it was with China's ability to compete in the world.Heinlein, Joseph J., Jr. Political Warfare: The Chinese Nationalist Model. (PHD Thesis, The American University 1974), p. 3 Since the founding of the PRC in 1949 they have centered much of their political warfare efforts within the United Front Work Department. The Chinese conception of political warfare includes the \\"Three Warfares\\" of public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and legal warfare. As of 2019 Taiwan (Republic of China) was still the primary target of PRC political warfare efforts. China's political warfare campaign aims to isolate Taiwan from the international community and interfere in Taiwan's democratic system and institutions. Soviet Union and Russia Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was committed to political warfare on classic totalitarian lines and continued to utilize propaganda towards internal and external audiences.Smith, p.21. \\"Active measures\\" (Russian: –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ –º–µ—Ä–æ–ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∏—è) was a Russian term to describe its political warfare activities both at home and abroad in support of Soviet domestic and foreign policy. Soviet efforts took many forms, ranging from propaganda, forgeries, and general disinformation to assassinations. The measures aimed to damage the enemy's image, create confusion, mould public opinion, and to exploit existing strains in international relations.Bittman, Ladislav, The KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider‚Äôs View. (Washington: Pergamaon-Brassey‚Äôs, 1985) p. 44 The Soviet Union dedicated vast resources and attention to these active measures, believing that \\"mass production of active measures would have a significant cumulative effect over a period of several decades\\".Bittman, p.43-45. Soviet active measures were notorious for targeting intended audience's public attitudes, to include prejudices, beliefs, and suspicions deeply rooted in the local history. Soviet campaigns fed disinformation that was psychologically consistent with the audience.Bittman, p.56. Examples of Soviet active measures include: *Operation Trust: was a counterintelligence operation conducted by Soviet intelligence against domestic and foreign adversaries. The operation, which ran from 1921‚Äì1929, set up a fake anti- Bolshevik underground organization, \\"Monarchist Union of Central Russia\\", MUCR (–ú–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—Ö–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –æ–±—ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, –ú–û–¶–†), which claimed to plan a conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government. The Trust aimed to create the view that communism was over in Russia and the Soviet Union would abandon its revolutionary ways. Western intelligence services supported the fake anti- Bolshevik dissidents who provided false intelligence reports. The operation's purpose was to identify real dissidents and anti-Bolsheviks, internally and abroad. The operation resulted in the arrests and executions of Russian exile leaders and the general demoralization of anti-Soviet efforts.Epstein, Edward Jay. Deception. (Simon and Schuster: 1989.), p. 23-27. *The \\"Rumor\\" Campaign: In October 1985, a Soviet weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta drew attention to a story in an obscure Indian paper, The Patriot, which alleged that the U.S government engineered the AIDS virus during biological warfare research in the U.S., and that it was being spread throughout the world by U.S. servicemen who had been used as guinea pigs for the experiment.Godson, Roy, \\"'AIDS‚ÄîMade in the USA': Moscow's Contagious Campaign,\\" Ladislav Bittman, ed., The New Image- Makers: Soviet Propaganda & Disinformation Today. (Washington: Pergamaon- Brassey's, 1988.) Chapter 10, pp. 221‚Äì225. The story was broadcast by Moscow's Radio Peace and Progress in English and Turkish broadcasts to Asian countries, some of which had important U.S. military bases. The \\"Rumor\\" campaign was highly effective in the 1980s and continues to resurface today throughout the world.Bittman, p.221 Communist strategy and tactics continually focused on revolutionary objectives, \\"for them the real war is the political warfare waged daily under the guise of peace\\".James D. Atkinson, The Politics of Struggle: The Communist Front and Political Warfare (Chicago: Henry Regnery Co,. 1966), p. vii. the purpose of which is to \\"disorient and disarm the opposition...to induce the desire to surrender in opposing peoples...to corrode the entire moral, political, and economic infrastructure of a nation\\".William R. Kintner and Joseph Z. Kornfeder. The New Frontier of War (Chicago, Henry Regnery Co., 1966), p. xiii. Lenin's mastery of \\"politics and struggle\\", remained objectives for the Soviet Union and other global communist regimes, such as the People's Republic of China. =Soviet political warfare in Afghanistan= The Soviet Union remains a comprehensive example of an aggressive nation which expanded its empire through covert infiltration and direct military involvement.Blackstock, p.71. Following World War II, the Soviet Union believed European economies would disintegrate, leaving social and economic chaos and allowing for Soviet expansion into new territories. The Soviets quickly deployed organizational weapons such as non-political front groups, sponsored 'spontaneous' mass appeals, and puppet politicians. While many of these countries' political and social structures were in post-war disarray, the Soviet Union's proxy communist parties were well-organized and able to take control of these weak, newly formed Eastern European governments.Smith, p.186. Moreover, the clandestine operations of the Soviet intelligence services and the occupying forces of the Soviet military further infiltrated the political and social spheres of the new satellites.Smith, p.187. Conversely, in 1979, the Soviet Union was unable to successfully penetrate the Afghan society after supporting a coup which brought a new Marxist government to power. While Soviet units were already in Kabul, Afghanistan at the time of the coup, additional Soviet troops arrived to reinforce the units and seize important provincial cities, bringing the total of Soviet troops inside Afghanistan to 125,000‚Äì140,000. The Soviets were unprepared for the Afghan resistance which included classic guerrilla tactics with foreign support. In 1989, Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan, having been unable to infiltrate the Afghan society or immobilize the resistance.Doughty, Robert. Warfare in the Western World, Vol. II. (D.C. Health and Company: 1996) p. 954-961. Taiwan Logo of political warfare in Taiwan The Republic of China Government in Taiwan recognized that its Communist adversary astutely employed political warfare to capitalize upon Kuomintang weaknesses over the years since Sun Yat-sen first mounted his revolution in the 1920s, and Chiang Kai-shek's regime had come to embrace a political warfare philosophy as both a defensive necessity and as the best foundation for consolidating its power in hope of their optimistic goal of \\"retaking the mainland\\". Both the Nationalist and Communist Chinese political warfare doctrines stem from the same historical antecedents at the Whampoa Military Academy in 1924 under Soviet tutelage.Heinlein, Joseph J., Jr. Political Warfare: The Chinese Nationalist Model. (Ph.D. thesis, The American University 1974), p. 3 The Nationalist Chinese experience with political warfare can be treated in a much more tangible way than merely tracing doctrinal development. In Taiwan today, the concept is virtually synonymous with the General Political Warfare Department of the Ministry of National Defense, which has authored political doctrine and is the culmination of a series of organizational manifestations of its application. United States =Creation of political warfare capacity= Logo used on aid delivered to European countries during the Marshall Plan. American foreign policy demonstrates a tendency to move towards political warfare in times of tension and perceived threat, and toward public diplomacy in times of improved relations and peace. American use of political warfare depends on its central political vision of the world and its subsequent foreign policy objectives.Smith, p.21 After World War II, the threat of Soviet expansion brought two new aims for American political warfare: #To restore Western Europe through military, economic, and political support #To weaken the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe through propagandaSmith, p. 192. President Harry S. Truman established a government political warfare capability in the National Security Act of 1947. The act created the U.S. National Security Council, which became the infrastructure necessary to apply military power to political purposes.Smith, p.196. Additionally, the United States crafted the Marshall Plan, which provided funding to rebuild, from 1947 to 1951, the European countries devastated by war. President Truman voiced the United States' national, universalist vision for political warfare against the Soviet Union in an address before Congress on March 12, 1947, thereby establishing the Truman Doctrine: > The peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had > totalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will. The Government of > the United States has made frequent protests against coercion and > intimidation, in violation of the Yalta agreement, in Poland, Rumania, and > Bulgaria. I must also state that in a number of other countries there have > been similar developments. > One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is > distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free > elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, > and freedom from political oppression. > The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly > imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a > controlled press and radio; fixed elections, and the suppression of personal > freedoms. > I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free > peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by > outside pressures. > I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies > in their own way. > I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial > aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political > processes. > The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They > spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their > full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must > keep that hope alive. > The free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their > freedoms. > If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world ‚Äì > and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own nation.President Harry > S. Truman's Address Before a Joint Session of Congress, March 12, 1947, > (Avalon Project, Yale Law School), Yale.edu > =Containment policy= The Truman Doctrine was the post-WWII basis for American political warfare operations on which the United States government went further to formulate an active, defensive strategy to contain the Soviet threat.Smith, p.192. On 4 May 1948, George F. Kennan, the father of the containment policy, wrote the Policy Planning Staff Memorandum titled \\"The Inauguration of Organized Political Warfare\\". This National Security Council (NSC) memo established a directorate of political warfare operations, under the control of the NSC, known as the Consultative (or Evaluation) Board of the National Security Council. This directorate fell under the authority of the Secretary of State, while the Board had complete authority over covert political operations. It recognized political warfare as one instrument in the United States' grand strategy. Kennan defined 'political warfare' as \\"the employment of all means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives. Such actions are both overt and covert. They range from such overt actions as political alliances, economic measures (such as ERP ‚Äì the Marshall Plan), and 'white' propaganda to such covert operations as clandestine support of 'friendly' foreign elements, 'black' psychological warfare and even encouragement of underground resistance in hostile states.\\" The memo further defined four projects that were activated by the Board to combat growing Communist influence abroad, including: *Liberation Committees: to encourage the formation of a public American organization which will sponsor selected political refugee committees to give support and guidance to national movements gestating in the Soviet World; *Support of indigenous anti- communist elements: within threatened countries of the free world, to include covertly using private intermediaries; *Underground activities behind the Iron Curtain *Preventive direct action in free countries: only in cases of dire necessity. This covert operation involved: control over anti-sabotage activities in the Venezuelan oil fields, American sabotage of Near Eastern oil installations on the verge of Soviet capture, and designation of key individuals threatened by the Kremlin who should be protected or removed elsewhere. =Cold War era= RFE/RL logo The United States used gray and black propaganda research, broadcasting, and print media operations during the Cold War to achieve its political warfare goals. These operations were conducted against Eastern European targets from Western Europe by two public- private organizations supported partly by the Central Intelligence Agency and the NSC, and partly by private corporations. These organizations were Free Europe, which was launched in 1941 and targeted Eastern Europe, and the American Committee for Liberation (AmComLib) created in 1951 to broadcast information into Soviet Russia. Both were renamed shortly thereafter and combined as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL).Smith, p. 198. Many RFE/RL recruits came either from European emigrants families who were strongly anti-Communist or from US government agencies, most notably from CIA. Officially, \\"the US government denied any responsibility for the radios and took care to conceal the channels of funding, personnel recruitment, and policy influence. Obviously, the major support was American, but it was plausibly not official American and it could be excluded from diplomatic intercourse and international legal complication.\\"Smith, p. 199. RFE/RL was considered to be a gray operation until its existence was publicly acknowledged by \\"activists\\" in the United States during the late 1960s. The goal of the radios was to present the truth to suppressed peoples behind the Iron Curtain \\"to aid in rebuilding a lively and diversified intellectual life in Europe which could...defeat Soviet...incursions on their freedom\\".Smith, p.202. In addition, Voice of America (VOA) started broadcasting to the Soviet citizens in 1947 under the pretext of countering \\"more harmful instances of Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies\\" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media. The Soviet Union responded by initiating electronic jamming of VOA broadcasts on April 24, 1949. In the fall of 1950 a group of scholars including physicists, historians and psychologists from Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and RAND Corporation undertook a research study of psychological warfare for the Department of State. The Project Troy Report to the Secretary of State, presented to Secretary of State on 1 February 1951, made various proposals for political warfare, including possible methods of minimizing the effects of Soviet jamming on the Voice of America broadcasts. It can be assumed that the Truman administration tried to implement plans established by the Project Troy in the project Overload and Delay. The purpose of the latter was to break the Stalinist system by increasing the number of input points in the system and by creating complex and unpredictable situations requiring action. An overt, non- governmental form of political warfare during the Cold War emerged after President Ronald Reagan's 8 June 1982 speech to the British Parliament. In his speech, Reagan appealed for a \\"global crusade for democracy\\"Robert Ree, \\"Political Warfare Old and New: The State and Private Groups in the Formation of the National Endowment for Democracy,\\" 49th Parallel, 22 (Autumn 2008): 22. and as a result, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) was created in December 1983. The NED was a non-governmental organization (NGO) based on four fundamental foundations: * The National Democratic Institute * The National Republican Institute to dispense funds and training to politicians and political parties; * The Center for International Private Enterprise to provide training, funding and networking opportunities for business associations; * AFL-CIO to assist foreign trade unions.Pee, 22. The NED \\"funded programs in support of candidates acceptable to the US in elections in Grenada, Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala throughout 1984 and 1985 in order to prevent communist victories, and create stable pro-US governments\\". It was also active in Europe, funding groups to carry promote pro-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) propaganda in Britain, as well as a \\"right wing French student organisation...linked to fascist paramilitaries\\". Other notable efforts included anti-Sandinista propaganda and opposition efforts in Nicaragua as well as anti-Communist propaganda and opposition efforts in support of the Solidarity movement in Poland between 1984 and 1990. According to a 1991 interview in the Washington Post with one of the creators of the NED, Allen Weinstein, \\"a lot of what we (NED) do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA\\". Liberty Square, W≈Çoc≈Çawek, Poland. The monument is of a Red Army soldier and Polish peasant, holding hands. The Soviet Union used Red Army monuments in Soviet occupied countries as a propaganda tool.

Formed in 1970, the organization sought to create a revolutionary state through armed struggle, and to remove Italy from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Red Brigades attained notoriety in the 1970s and early 1980s with their violent acts of sabotage, bank robberies, kidnappings and murders. Nearly 50 people were killed in its attacks between 1974 and 1988. According to the Center for International Security and Cooperation, the Red Brigades was a \\"broadly diffused\\" terrorist group. Models for the Red Brigades included the Latin American urban guerrilla movements and the World War II Italian partisan movement, which was itself a mostly leftist, anti-fascist revolutionary movement that the Red Brigades saw itself as a continuation of, an example of a youthful anti-fascist minority using violent means for just ends. The group was also influenced by volumes on the Tupamaros published by Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, \\"a sort of do-it-yourself manual for the early Red Brigades\\".Paul Ginsborg, A History of Contemporary Italy 1943‚Äì1988, Penguin 1990 p. 361‚Äì362 The group's most infamous act took place in 1978, when a group headed by Mario Moretti kidnapped the former Christian Democrat Prime Minister Aldo Moro. The kidnappers killed five members of Moro's police escort, and Moro himself 54 days later. In the 1980s, the group was broken up by Italian investigators, with the aid of several leaders under arrest who turned pentito and assisted the authorities in capturing the other members.  1970: the first BR generation  The Red Brigades were founded in August 1970Alexander p. 194 by Renato Curcio and Margherita (Mara) Cagol, who had met as students at the University of Trento and later married, and Alberto Franceschini. Franceschini's grandmother had been a leader of the peasant leagues, his father a worker and anti-fascist who had been deported to Auschwitz.Paul Ginsborg, A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics 1943‚Äì1988, (London: Penguin, 1990) p.361. While the Trento group around Curcio had its main roots in the Sociology Department of the Catholic University, the Reggio Emilia group (around Franceschini) included mostly former members of the FGCI (the communist youth movement) expelled from the parent party for extremist views.A Jamieson. Identity and morality in the Italian Red Brigades. Terrorism and Political Violence, 1990, p. 508-15 In the beginning, the Red Brigades were mainly active in Reggio Emilia, in large factories in Milan, (such as Sit-Siemens, Pirelli and Magneti Marelli), and in Turin (Fiat). Members sabotaged factory equipment and broke into factory offices and trade union headquarters. In 1972, they carried out their first kidnapping: a factory foreman for Sit Siemens was held for around 20 minutes whilst pictures were taken of him wearing a placard declaring him to be a fascist.R. Lumley, States of Emergency: Cultures of Revolt in Italy from 1968 to 1978, (London: Verso, 1990) p.282. The foreman was then released unharmed.See Giovanni Fasanella and Alberto Franceschini (with an afterword by judge Rosario Priore, who investigated Aldo Moro's death), Che cosa sono le BR ( \\"BRIGADES ROUGES. L'Histoire secr√®te des Red Brigades racont√©e par leur fondateur, Alberto Franceschini. Entretien avec Giovanni Fasanella.\\" Editions Panama, 2005 a review by Le Monde During this time the Red Brigades' activities were denounced by far left political groups such as Lotta Continua and Potere Operaio, which were closer to the Autonomist movement. Frequent allegations of links between the Red Brigades and the intelligence services of communist states were made but never proven, and were always rejected by the militants in books, interviews etc. In June 1974, the Red Brigades killed two members of the Italian neo-fascist party, Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI), during a raid on the MSI headquarters in Padua.  1974 arrest of BR founders  In September 1974, Red Brigades founders Renato Curcio and Alberto Franceschini were arrested by General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The arrest was made possible by \\"Frate Mitra\\", alias Silvano Girotto, a former monk who had infiltrated the BR for the Italian security services.Brigate Rosse and Moro Kidnappig: secrets and lies Curcio was freed from prison by an armed commando of the Red Brigades, led by his wife Mara Cagol, but was rearrested some time later. The Red Brigades then operated some high-profile political kidnappings (e.g., Genoa judge Mario Sossi) and kidnapped industrialists (e.g., Vallarino Gancia) in order to obtain ransom money which (together with bank robberies) were their main source of income.  Expansion and radicalization  After 1974, the Red Brigades expanded into Rome, Genoa, and Venice, their numbers grew drastically and began to diversify in its criminal ventures. Bank robberies, kidnappings, drugs and arms trafficking were the major crimes. Its 1975 manifesto stated that its goal was a \\"concentrated strike against the heart of the State, because the state is an imperialist collection of multinational corporations\\". The \\"SIM\\" (Stato Imperialista delle Multinazionali) became a primary target. In 1975, the Carabinieri discovered the farmhouse where industrialist Vallarino Gancia was kept prisoner by the Brigades (Cascina Spiotta). In the ensuing gunfight, two police officers were killed, as was Mara Cagol, Curcio's wife. That following April, the Red Brigades announced that they had set up a Communist Combatant Party to \\"guide the working class.\\" Terrorist activities, especially against Carabinieri and magistrates, increased considerably, in order to terrorize juries and cause mistrials in cases against imprisoned leaders of the organization. Also, since arrested members of the Brigades refused to be defended by lawyers, lawyers designated by the Courts to defend them (\\"difensori d' ufficio\\") were also targeted and killed. Amongst jurists, Professor Fausto Cuocolo was also attacked in 1979, during an exam at University of Genoa: it was the first time that BR attacked in a school.  Kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro  Moro, photographed during his detention by the Red Brigades In 1978, the Second BR, headed by Mario Moretti, kidnapped and murdered Christian Democrat Aldo Moro, who was the key figure in negotiations aimed at extending the Government's parliamentary majority, by attaining a Historic Compromise between the Italian Communist Party and the Democrazia Cristiana. A team of Red Brigades members, using stolen Alitalia airline company uniforms, ambushed Moro, killed five of Moro's bodyguards and took him captive. The captors, headed by Moretti, sought the release of certain prisoners in exchange for Moro's safe release. The Government refused to negotiate with the captors, while Italian political forces took either a hard line (\\"linea della fermezza\\") or one open to negotiating (\\"linea del negoziato\\"). From his captivity, Moro sent letters to his family, to his political friends and to the Pope, pleading for a negotiated outcome. After holding Moro for 54 days, the Brigades realized that the Government would not negotiate and, fearful of being discovered, decided to kill their prisoner. They placed him in a car and told him to cover himself with a blanket. Mario Moretti then shot him eleven times in the chest. Moro's body was left in the trunk of a car in Via Caetani, a site midway between the Christian Democratic Party and the Communist Party headquarters, as a last symbolic challenge to the police, who were keeping the entire nation, and Rome in particular, under strict surveillance. Moretti wrote in Brigate Rosse: una storia italiana that the murder of Moro was the last expression of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist revolutionary action. Original founder Alberto Franceschini wrote that the imprisoned members did not understand why Moro had been chosen as a target. Moro was killed for his value as a symbolic representation of everything the Brigades opposed, rather than anything to do with his individual actions or beliefs. Aldo Moro's assassination caused a strong reaction against the Brigades by the Italian law enforcement and security forces. The murder of a popular political figure also drew condemnation from other Italian left-wing militant formations and even the imprisoned ex-leaders of the Brigades. The Brigades suffered a loss of support. These events were portrayed in the 2003 Italian film by Marco Bellocchio, Good Morning, Night. A crucial turning point was the murder, in 1979, of Guido Rossa, a member of the PCI and a trade union organizer. Rossa had observed the distribution of BR propaganda and had reported those involved to the police. He was shot and killed by the Brigades; this attack against a popular trade union organiser proved disastrous, totally alienating the factory worker base to which BR propaganda was primarily directed. Also, Italian police made a large number of arrests in 1980: 12,000 far-left militants were detained while 300 fled to France and 200 to South America; a total of 600 people left Italy. On the Autonomia Operaia movement, M√©moire de ma√Ætrise (Master's degree, now M1), University of Paris X: Nanterre, 2004 Most leaders arrested (including, e.g., Faranda, Franceschini, Moretti, Morucci) either retracted their doctrine (as dissociati), or collaborated with investigators in the capture of other BR members (as Collaboratori di giustizia), obtaining important reductions in prison sentences. The best-known collaboratore di giustizia was Patrizio Peci, one of the leaders of the Turin \\"column\\". In revenge, the Brigades assassinated his brother Roberto in 1981, significantly damaging the standing of the group and lowering them in the public's eyes to little more than a supposedly radical Cosa Nostra. On 7 April 1979, the Marxist philosopher Antonio Negri was arrested along with the other persons associated with the Autonomist movement, including Oreste Scalzone. Padua's Public Prosecutor, Pietro Calogero, accused those involved in the Autonomia movement of being the political wing of the Red Brigades. Negri was charged with a number of offences including leadership of the Red Brigades, masterminding the kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro and plotting to overthrow the government. At the time, Negri was a political science professor at the University of Padua, visiting lecturer at Paris' √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. Thus, French philosophers F√©lix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze signed in November 1977 L'Appel des intellectuels fran√ßais contre la r√©pression en Italie (The Call of French Intellectuals Against Repression in Italy) in protest against Negri's imprisonment and Italian anti-terrorism legislation.Gilles Deleuze, Lettre ouverte aux juges de Negri, text n¬∞20 in Deux r√©gimes de fous, Mille et une nuits, 2003 (transl. of Lettera aperta ai giudici di Negri published in La Repubblica on 10 May 1979); Ce livre est litt√©ralement une preuve d'innocence, text n¬∞21 (op.cit.), originally published in Le Matin de Paris on 13 December 1979 A year later, Negri was exonerated from Aldo Moro's kidnapping. No link was ever established between Negri and the Red Brigades and almost all of the charges against him (including 17 murders) were dropped within months of his arrest due to lack of evidence. Aldo Moro's assassination continues to haunt Italy today, and remains a significant event of the Cold War. In the 1980s-1990s, a Commission headed by senator Giovanni Pellegrino investigated acts of terrorism in Italy during the \\"Years of Lead\\", while various judicial investigations also took place, headed by Guido Salvini and other magistrates.  The BR in the 1980s  Most of the BR were dismantled in the 1980s.  Kidnapping of Brigadier General Dozier  On 17 December 1981, four members of the Red Brigades, posing as plumbers, invaded the Verona apartment of US Army Brigadier General James L. Dozier, then NATO Deputy Chief of Staff at Southern European land forces. The men kidnapped General Dozier and left his wife bound and chained in their apartment.Collin, Richard Oliver and Gordon L. Freedman. Winter of Fire, Dutton, 1990. He was held for 42 days until 28 January 1982, when a team of NOCS (a special operations unit of the Italian police) successfully carried out his rescue from an apartment in Padua, without firing a shot, capturing the entire terrorist cell. The guard, Ugo MilaniUgo Milani, assigned to kill General Dozier in the event of a rescue attempt did not do so, and was overwhelmed by the rescuing force. Dozier was the first American general to be kidnapped by insurgents and the first foreigner kidnapped by the Red Brigades. After Dozier's return to the US Army in Vicenza, he was congratulated by telephone by President Reagan on regaining his freedom.Dozier, General James/Red Brigade Kidnapping Incident.

Mulinaris' 1983 arrest  After the Abb√© Pierre's death in January 2007, Italian magistrate Carlo Mastelloni recalled in the Corriere della Sera that the Abb√© Pierre had \\"spontaneously testified\\" in the 1980s in support of a group of Italian activists who had fled to Paris and were involved with the Hyperion language school, directed by Vanni Mulinaris. Simone de Beauvoir had also written a letter to Mastelloni, which has been kept in juridical archives.¬´Quel giorno in Tribunale con lui difese i terroristi rossi e l' Hyperion¬ª, Corriere della Sera, 23 January 2007 Some of those associated with the Hyperion School (which included Corrado Simioni, Vanni Mulinaris and Duccio BerioAbb√© Pierre, il frate ribelle che scelse gli emarginati, Corriere della Sera, 23 January 2007 ) were accused by the Italian authorities of being the \\"masterminds\\" of the BR, although they were all cleared afterwards. After Vanni Mulinaris' travel to Udine and subsequent arrest by the Italian justice, the Abb√© Pierre went to talk in 1983 with Italian President Sandro Pertini to plead Mulinaris' cause. Mulinaris had been imprisoned on a charge of assisting the BR. The Abb√© had even observed eight days of a hunger strike from 26 May to 3 June 1984 in the Cathedral of Turin to protest the conditions suffered by \\"Brigadists\\" in Italian prisons and the imprisonment without trial of Vanni Mulinaris, who was recognized as innocent some time afterwards. Mulinaris' treatment was, according to the Abb√©, a \\"violation of human rights\\".L'abb√© Pierre, fondateur d'Emma√ºs, est mort, necrology in Le Monde of the Abb√© Pierre, 22 January 2007 CAMT. R√©pertoire papiers Abb√© Pierre/Emmaus, on the website of the French Archives Nationales (National Archives) D'inattendues amiti√©s brigadistes, Lib√©ration, 24 January 2007 La Repubblica specified that Italian justice has recognized the innocence of all people close to the Hyperion School.AFP news cable: \\"ROME, 23 January 2007 (AFP) ‚Äì L'Abb√© Pierre et les Brigades rouges italiennes : un √©pisode m√©connu\\" (23 January 2007), published on La Croix's website here  Red Brigades-PCC and Red Brigades-UCC 1981 split  In 1981, the Red Brigades had split into two factions: the majority faction of the Communist Combatant Party (Red Brigades-PCC, led by Barbara Balzerani) and the minority of the Union of Combatant Communists (Red Brigades-UCC, led by Giovanni Senzani). In 1984, the Red Brigades claimed responsibility for the murder of Leamon Hunt, United States chief of the Sinai Multinational Force and Observer Group. In the same year, Curcio, Moretti, Iannelli and Bertolazzi, rejected the armed struggle as pointless. In the 1980s, the arrests rate increased in Italy, including that of Senzani in 1982 and of Balzerani in 1985. In February 1986, the Red Brigades-PCC killed the ex-mayor of Florence Lando Conti. In March 1987, Red Brigades-UCC assassinated General Licio Giorgieri in Rome. On 16 April 1988, in Forl√¨, Red Brigades-PCC killed Italian senator Roberto Ruffilli, an advisor of Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco de Mita. After that, the group activities all but ended after massive arrests of its leadership. The BR dissolved themselves in 1988.Paolo Perschichetti, \\"De l'usage s√©lectif du pass√©\\", on Parole donn√©e  Flight to France  In 1985 some Italian members living in France returned to Italy. The same year, French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand guaranteed immunity from extradition to BR members living in France who had made a break with their past, were not sentenced for violent crimes and had started a new life. In 1998, Bordeaux's appeal court decided that Sergio Tornaghi could not be extradited to Italy, on the grounds that Italian procedure would not let him be judged again, after a trial during his absence. In 2002, however, Paris extradited Paolo Persichetti, an ex-member of the Red Brigades who was teaching sociology, signaling for the first time a departure from the \\"Mitterrand doctrine\\". In the 2000s (decade), requests by Italian Justice for extradition from France involved several leftist activists, including Antonio Negri, Cesare Battisti, and others. While leftists had mostly fled to France, many neofascist activists involved in the strategy of tension, such as Vincenzo Vinciguerra or Stefano Delle Chiaie, fled to Spain; Delfo Zorzi, condemned for the Piazza Fontana bombing, was granted asylum and citizenship in Japan, while others fled to Argentina (in particular Augusto Canchi, wanted by Italian justice for his role in the 1980 Bologna massacre.Denuncian que Almir√≥n tambi√©n particip√≥ en la ultraderecha espa√±ola , Telam Argentine news agency, 6 January 2007 ) The issue of a general amnesty in Italy for these crimes is highly controversial and still source of dispute. Most political forces oppose it and, in particular, the associations of victims of terrorism and their family members are adamantly against it.  Later assassinations  A new group, with few links, if any, with the old BR, appeared in the late 1990s. The Red Brigades-PCC in 1999 murdered , an advisor to the cabinet of Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema. On 19 March 2002, the same gun was used to kill professor Marco Biagi, an economic advisor to Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Red Brigades-PCC again claimed responsibility. On 3 March 2003, two followers, Mario Galesi and Nadia Desdemona Lioce, started a firefight with a police patrol on a train at Castiglion Fiorentino station, near Arezzo. Galesi and Emanuele Petri (one of the policemen) were killed, Lioce was arrested. On 23 October 2003, Italian police arrested six members of the Red Brigades in early-dawn raids in Florence, Sardinia, Rome and Pisa in connection with the murder of Massimo D'Antona. On 1 June 2005, four members of the Red Brigades- PCC were condemned to life-sentence in Bologna for the murder of Marco Biagi: Nadia Desdemona Lioce, Roberto Morandi, Marco Mezzasalma and Diana Blefari Melazzi. Several figures from the 1970s, including philosopher Antonio Negri who was wrongly accused of being the \\"mastermind\\" of the BR, have called for a new analysis of the events which happened during the \\"years of lead\\" in Italy. On the other hand, BR founder Alberto Franceschini declared after his release from an 18-year prison term that \\"The BR continue to exist because we never proceeded to their funeral\\", calling for truth from every involved party in order to be able to turn the page.Giovanni Fasanella and Alberto Franceschini, Che cosa sono le BR (See Paris, capitale des ¬´ ann√©es de plomb ¬ª, review of the book in Le Monde, 30 November 2005 )  Statistics  According to Clarence A. Martin, the BR were credited with 14,000 acts of violence in the first ten years of the group's existence. According to statistics by the Ministry of Interior, a total of 75 people are thought to have been murdered by the BR. A majority of the murders were politically motivated, though a number of assassinations of random police and carabinieri officers took place, as well as a number of murders occurring during criminal ventures such as bank robberies and kidnappings.  East Bloc support  The Red Brigades‚Äô primary foreign support came from the Czechoslovak StB and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Soviet and Czechoslovak small arms and explosives came from the Middle East via heroin traffickers along well established smuggling routes. Logistic support and training were carried out directly by the Czechoslovak StB both in Prague and at remote PLO training camps in North Africa and Syria. Smuggled Czechoslovakian-made ≈†korpion submachine pistols were used by the Red Brigades in many of their attacks, including the ambush of Aldo Moro's motorcade (and his later murder), the Acca Larentia killings, a 1982 ambush on an army patrol in Salerno, as well as the murders of Roberto Peci, Diplomat Leamon Hunt, and Commissioner Antonio Esposito. Aware of the involvement and fearing retaliation due to their own involvement with the KGB, the Italian Communist Party lodged several complaints with the Soviet ambassador in Rome regarding Czechoslovak support of the Red Brigades, but the Soviets were either unwilling or unable to stop the StB. This was one of several contributing factors in ending the covert relationship that the Italian Communist Party had with the KGB, culminating with a total break in 1979. Italian journalist Loretta Napoleoni claimed in a TED Talk that she spoke to a \\"part-timer\\" with the Red Brigades who claimed that he used to sail between Lebanon and Italy during summers, ferrying Soviet weapons for a fee from the PLO to Sardinia where the weapons were distributed to \\"other organizations in Europe\\".  Later developments  In October 2007, a former BR commander was arrested after committing a bank robbery while out-of-prison on good conduct terms. On 1 October 2007, Cristoforo Piancone, who is serving a life sentence for six murders, managed to steal ‚Ç¨170,000 from the bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena with an accomplice.

Revolutionary violence in Marxism  In his article \\"The Victory of the Counter-Revolution in Vienna\\" in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung (No. 136, 7 November 1848), Karl Marx wrote that there is only one means to shorten, simplify and concentrate the murderous death throes of the old society and the bloody birth pangs of the new, only one means‚Äîrevolutionary terrorism.Karl Marx ‚Äì Friedrich Engels ‚Äì Werke, Berlin: Dietz Verlag, Vol. V, 1959, pp. 455-7. ; for English translation see In his biography of Joseph Stalin, Edvard Radzinsky, a Russian author of popular history books, noted that Stalin wrote a nota bene‚Äî\\"Terror is the quickest way to new society\\"‚Äîbeside the above passage in a book by Karl Kautsky.Edvard Radzinsky Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives, Anchor, (1997) Karl Kautsky, Terrorism and Communism (1919), Ch.

Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and other leading Bolshevik ideologists recognized mass terror as a necessary weapon during the dictatorship of proletariat and the resulting class struggle. In his The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade K. Kautsky (1918), Lenin wrote: \\"One cannot hide the fact that dictatorship presupposes and implies a \\"condition\\", one so disagreeable to renegades [such as Kautsky], of revolutionary violence of one class against another ... the \\"fundamental feature\\" of the concept of dictatorship of the proletariat is revolutionary violence\\". The Bolsheviks engaged in a form of social determinism that was hostile to bourgeoisie and wealthier classes. Martin Latsis, one of the Soviet leaders directing the Cheka, stated his intentions for those classes who were considered reactionary and incapable of being reeducated. Latsis wrote: > We are engaged in exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class.

The Red Terror is a weapon used against a class that, despite being doomed to destruction, does not want to perish\\".\\"Black book of Communism\\", page 749 On the other hand, they opposed individual terror, which has been used earlier by the People's Will organization. According to Trotsky: \\"The damaging of machines by workers, for example, is terrorism in this strict sense of the word. The killing of an employer, a threat to set fire to a factory or a death threat to its owner, an assassination attempt, with revolver in hand, against a government minister‚Äîall these are terrorist acts in the full and authentic sense. However, anyone who has an idea of the true nature of international Social Democracy ought to know that it has always opposed this kind of terrorism and does so in the most irreconcilable way\\". Many later Marxists, in particular Karl Kautsky, criticized Bolshevik leaders for terrorism tactics. He stated that \\"among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, Terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all\\".Karl Kautsky, Terrorism and Communism Chapter VIII, The Communists at Work, The Terror  Soviet Union  Lenin, Trotsky and other leading Bolshevik ideologists promulgated mass terror as a necessary weapon during the dictatorship of proletariat and the resulting class struggle. In his book Terrorism and Communism, Trotsky emphasized that \\"the historical tenacity of the bougeoisie is colossal[.] [...] We are forced to tear off this class and chop it away. The Red Terror is a weapon used against a class that, despite being doomed to destruction, does not want to perish\\". On the other hand, they opposed to individual terror, which has been used earlier by the People's Will.

Kautsky argued that that Red Terror represented a variety of terrorism because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population and included taking and executing hostages. People were executed simply for who they were, not for their deeds. This and similar types of pronouncements by Communist leaders have led many historians to conclude that despotism, violent persecution, repression and intolerance were intrinsic drives in Communist regimes.Richard Pipes Communism: A History (2001) , pages 39.

Knopf. 720 pages It involved the purge of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the persecution of unaffiliated persons, both occurring within a period characterized by omnipresent police surveillance, widespread suspicion of \\"saboteurs\\", imprisonment and killings. In the Western World, this was referred to as \\"the Great Terror\\". The Soviet collectivization of agriculture used terror against the peasants that resisted, see \\"Dekulakization\\".

Flutrack platform gathers and visualizes tweets every 20 minutes in real time. This open platform and its API allow users and developers to extend this project and take influenza detection to higher levels. The platform could work not only with Twitter but with any data provider. For monitoring purposes, Flutrack gathers flu related tweets for the entire world using the Twitter API. Since the above procedure is complete, the system visualizes and updates tweets every 20 minutes. The Flutrack open-platform differs from similar tracking services in that it extracts and processes flu related data in real time, without interruption.  Feasibility of monitoring influenza  Influenza, or flu, is a viral infection that affects mainly the throat, nose, bronchi and occasionally lungs. It is considered one of the most common human infectious diseases. Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health concern, causing tens of millions of respiratory illnesses and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Influenza differs from the common cold as it is caused by a different group of viruses, and its symptoms tend to be more severe and to last longer. Infection usually lasts for about a week, and is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, aching muscles, headache and severe malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat and rhinitis. Symptoms usually peak after two or three days. Self-diagnosis of influenza is common among the general public. The best predictions for influenza are cough and fever, since this combination of symptoms has been shown to have a positive predictive value of around 80% in differentiating influenza within a population suffering from flu-like symptoms.  Twitter and influenza relation  Twitter, a micro-blogging service, has an estimated community of 500 million active users, generating 340 million messages daily. Twitter users are enabled to send and read one another's 140-character messages, called \\"tweets\\". Despite the high level of noise, the Twitter stream contains information that can be useful for tracking or even forecasting trends, moods or behaviour if it can be extracted in an efficient manner. Furthermore, Twitter has been used as a real-time source for various public health applications.  Flutrack's monitoring tags  The words used as tags are influenza synonyms and common flu symptoms. List of the monitoring tags: * Influenza * flu * chills * headache * sore throat * runny nose * sneeze/ing * fever * cough, dry cough  Tweet filtering  Before saving flu-related tweets to Flutrack's open database, the system filters them automatically by removing tags and hashtags (including @, # symbols). Moreover, only geolocated tweets and tweets whose geolocations are extracted from user profile location (self-declared home location) are saved to the database. If enough location information is not available, tweets are automatically avoided. Tweets having fewer than 5 characters and those containing non-ASCII characters are excluded. Profile location is also automatically filtered from \\"suspicious\\" words (home, heaven etc.), to avoid false or nonexistent location coordinates.  Results and statistics  To evaluate the accuracy of extracted data and results, a correlation between Flutrack's and Google Flu Trends‚Äô datasets hat to be examined. All tweets, from both data providers, were geolocated in the U.S. and extracted from December 2, 2012 to April 7, 2013. The location was chosen based on the fact that the query counts of Google Flu Trends are compared with reliable sources, such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other traditional flu surveillance systems for the U.S. The scatter plot of the normalized population of tweets both from Google Flu Trends and the Flutrack platform was plotted. To quantify the degree of the observed linear relation between the normalized uploads of the two social media, a linear regression analysis was performed. The corresponding coefficient of determination was estimated to be 0.79 thus showing a high degree of correlation between Google Flu Trends and the Flutrack platform.  References  * Beveridge, W.

The film was produced by Rat Pack Filmproduktion in coproduction with Constantin Film. Fack ju G√∂the premiered on 29 October 2013 in Munich, and was subsequently released in cinemas on 7 November 2013. It was released in the United States under the title Suck Me Shakespeer.  Plot  Bank robber Zeki M√ºller has just been out of prison. Upon his release, he goes to retrieve the money he stole in order to repay a debt, but his friend buried it in a construction site. During Zeki's time in prison, the construction project was completed and his money is now buried beneath the new gymnasium at the Goethe Gesamtschule. In order to obtain the money, Zeki applies for the vacant position of a deceased janitor. However, due to a misunderstanding, he is given a job as a substitute teacher. Elisabeth \\"Lisi\\" Schnabelstedt is a student teacher at the Goethe Gesamtschule, her former high school, because she has guardianship over her younger sister, Laura. Lisi does not impose the necessary authority to manage the students successfully. When Ingrid Leimbach- Knorr, homeroom teacher of class 10B, attempts suicide, the management of the difficult class goes to Lisi Schnabelstedt, although the class's brutal pranks upon the new teacher quickly reduces her to tears. Zeki takes over as the substitute homeroom teacher for Lisi's former seventh grade class. In order to regain his money, Zeki works during the night in the cellar of the school on a tunnel leading to the buried money. He also copies Lisi's diploma because he does not have a high school or college education, which eventually becomes known to Lisi. She then blackmails Zeki, allowing her to get her old seventh grade class back while Zeki assumes responsibility over class 10B. Zeki is thrown out of his living situation at a strip club, and tries to sleep in Lisi's garage. When discovered, Lisi allows Zeki to live in her basement as long as he properly teaches class 10B instead of watching films every class period. Through unconventional methods and Lisi's soft leadership, Zeki gains the respect of the class. Although Zeki begins his time as a teacher with draconian methods including shooting students with a paintball gun and holding a student underwater, he eventually takes a softer approach and convinces the students that they do not want to become drug dealers and dependent on welfare by taking them on a field trip to visit Zeki's acquaintances who live this lifestyle. He also becomes more involved in the school by taking over the leadership of the Drama Club, which performs a modern version of Romeo and Juliet, and helping out with the Jugend forscht group. Zeki, concerned about Lisi's image amongst the class, leads the class on an excursion to paint graffiti on a train, during which a student paints the title ‚ÄòFack ju G√∂hte‚Äô. As a result of this increased respect, Lisi passes her practical teaching exam with class 10B. In addition, Zeki arranges an affair for Lisi's little sister Laura with her crush Danger, as well as ensuring Lisi's continued legal guardianship of Laura by pretending to be Lisi's serious boyfriend when Laura's social worker comes to visit. Eventually Zeki finds the money in the tunnel, but the tunnel beneath the gymnasium causes the floor to break and allows Lisi to discover Zeki filling in the tunnel. When Lisi learns about Zeki's past as a criminal, she threatens to call the police if he does not leave his job and her home at once. Zeki, out of options, agrees to drive the get away car for a bank heist. As Zeki's class is about to take their final exam in German, they all take out their motivation photos. A student informs Lisi that Zeki's motivation photo is in his desk. When Lisi opens the desk, she discovers that his motivation for becoming a better person is her. A friend of Zeki's is able to convince that Zeki wants to change his ways for her. Zeki doesn't follow through with the heist because three students stop him to ask if he will be their homeroom teacher next year and he sees the train with the ‚ÄòFack ju G√∂the‚Äô graffiti. He sends Lisi a dress and an invitation to the prom and reports himself to the school principal. The principal wants to keep him and even hands him a falsified high school diploma with a 2.0 GPA. She informs Zeki that the class 10B has drastically improved and if they continue to work towards their high school diplomas, the school will become the best in the city. Their marks in German, previously 5's and 6's (equivalent to F's), have now become better than 3's (C's).

Producer Lena Sch√∂mann praised M'Barek for his 'unbelievable discipline', as the actor had worked out five times a week with a personal trainer, losing eight kilos, months before filming began. M'Barek had just trained his upper body for T√ºrkisch f√ºr Anf√§nger.Press material of 'Fack ju G√∂hte' The main female role was played by Grimme Award winner Karoline Herfurth, who after M√§dchen, M√§dchen and its 2004 sequel was only seen rarely in comedies. Sch√∂mann gave his reasons for Herfurth's choice, stating that she 'has a fantastic instinct for comedy and timing'. The role of school principal went to Katja Riemann, who had just made a guest-appearance in the film of the series T√ºrkisch f√ºr Anf√§nger. A student role was given to Max von der Groeben, who received a ‚Äòbest young actor‚Äô award at the presentation of the 2013 Goldenen Kamera.

The actor has previously appeared in the show as Thomas McPhee in 2011. Mackenzie auditioned for the role of Bailey and a week after attending a second call back, he learned that he had been cast in the show. Mackenzie commented that getting the part of Bailey was \\"amazing\\" and he considered Neighbours his big break within the acting industry. He was initially contracted for four years. The character was created and introduced to Neighbours along with his family, as part of a major overhaul of the show's cast. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 7 February 2013. Bailey is the youngest member of the Turner family. He is portrayed as inquisitive and a nerd. He enjoys applying himself academically. Mackenzie described Bailey as being the glue of the family and someone who keeps a straight head. The actor revealed that he shares some similarities with Bailey. Shortly after his arrival, it emerged that Bailey had played a part in a robbery that saw his brother, Mason (Taylor Glockner), sent to juvenile detention, something their mother knew nothing about. Mackenzie enjoyed the storyline, calling it one of his favourites. Bailey became involved in a love triangle with his best friend, Callum (Morgan Baker), and Rani Kapoor (Coco Cherian), that ended in him almost losing his life. Towards the end of 2013, Bailey found himself being manipulated by his teacher Gem Reeves (Kathryn Beck). Creation and casting On 4 November 2012, it was announced that the five-strong Turner family would be introduced to Neighbours in February 2013. The family were created as part of a major overhaul of the show's cast. Of the Turners, Kate Kendall, who plays matriarch Lauren, explained \\"The producers were looking to get quite a traditional family in there and hark back to some of those old traditions and family values. They're going to be a really charismatic family, but you'll also get some really juicy storylines and that's what the audiences relate to. Viewers will relate to the familiarity of them and hopefully the sense of magnetism that we bring.\\" The Turners were given an immediate link in Erinsborough through long-term resident Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver), the father of Lauren and grandfather to Bailey and his siblings. Calen Mackenzie was cast as Bailey, the youngest member of the Turner family. Mackenzie had previously appeared in Neighbours as Thomas McPhee in 2011. Mackenzie went through an audition process and received a second call back, which made him start to believe that he might get the role. A week later, he learned that he had won the role of Bailey. Mackenzie was initially contracted for four years. When asked how he felt about joining the soap, Mackenzie said \\"I've done quite a few roles on new shows, but to be a part of something which has been going since before you were born and such a huge part of this collective consciousness is really amazing.\\" The actor also felt that Neighbours was his big break within the acting industry. Mackenzie made his first appearance as Bailey on 7 February 2013. Development Characterisation Bailey is the youngest child of Lauren and Matt Turner (Josef Brown). Before his on-screen introduction, Kendall described Bailey as being \\"a brain\\". A writer for the show's official website stated \\"Cheeky, left-of-centre and inquisitive, Bailey Turner is one switched on teen. A self described nerd, Bailey loves flexing his brain muscles and has a unique take on everything.\\" Bailey enjoys applying himself academically and he loves astronomy and physiology. Mackenzie called Bailey \\"the glue\\" of the Turner family, explaining \\"If Dad or Mason can't fix it, Bailey will always try. He is the one who keeps a straight head in the family.\\" He stated that Bailey gets on well with his siblings Amber (Jenna Rosenow) and Mason (Taylor Glockner), but there is a competitive spirit amongst them and sometimes they wind each other up. Bailey loves his parents equally and always wants the best for them. Mackenzie told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that he does share some similarities with Bailey, which include reading comics and playing video games. He added that he would like Bailey's rebellious side to come out more and for him to become less sensible as he develops. Bailey befriends Callum Jones (Morgan Baker) shortly after moving into Ramsay Street. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy commented that the friendship had had \\"lots of ups and downs\\" and Mackenzie agreed, saying \\"It's constantly up and down. They have periods of being good friends, but then something will always go wrong ‚Äì it's always a rollercoaster!\\" Off-screen, Mackenzie became friends with Baker and admitted that they often laugh during filming, particularly if Bailey and Callum have had a falling-out. Mount Isa robbery The Turner family were introduced with the promise that they would be hiding secrets. Eldest son Mason did not arrive with the family and shortly after moving into Number 32, the house was burgled. Bailey becomes \\"a mess\\" upon realising that someone entered the house. Later that night, he retrieves a large amount of money and hides it in a garden gnome, before \\"vigilantly keeping a nervous watch over his family throughout the night.\\" When Mason eventually arrives in town, it is revealed that he has been in juvenile detention for his part in a robbery that took place in Mount Isa. Bailey reassures him that he is keeping the proceeds of the crime safe. A Soap World columnist explained that Bailey has know all the details of the robbery for \\"some time\\" and is soon assuring his brother that he has been keeping the proceeds safe. When Bailey and Mason go to get the money, they find the garden gnome has disappeared. They later learn that the money is in the possession of their neighbour, Sheila Canning (Colette Mann), who eventually gives it back to them. When Mason is later arrested for another armed robbery, the Turner family is thrown \\"into chaos\\" and \\"a heartsick\\" Bailey confesses that he was also involved in the Mount Isa robbery, which in turn forces Matt to admit to Lauren that he covered up for Bailey. Both Bailey and Matt decide to tell the police about their involvement in the robbery and they face prosecution. Mackenzie commented that he \\"thoroughly enjoyed\\" his family's storylines upon their arrival, particularly the aftermath of the Mount Isa robbery. Love triangle Upon moving into Ramsay Street, Bailey immediately noticed Rani Kapoor (Coco Cherian) and developed a crush on her. However, he was warned off pursuing her by his friend Callum, who had wanted Rani to be his girlfriend for a while. Mackenzie commented that while it was hard for Bailey to back off, as he really liked Rani, he did not want to break the code by stealing his friend's potential girlfriend. Mackenzie said it was important to Bailey, but it was not easy as he could not switch his feelings for Rani off. Rani becomes torn between the two boys and eventually shares a kiss with Bailey while they are rehearsing for a school play. Callum is devastated when he finds out about the kiss and stops talking to Bailey, he also asks Rani to do the same. Things come to a head when Callum confronts Bailey, which results in a fight that leaves Bailey in a serious condition. Baker told an Inside Soap columnist that Callum feels let down by Bailey and Rani. Following Callum's ultimatum to Rani, he \\"tries desperately\\" to ignore the tension between her and Bailey. However, it gets too much for him when he sees them talking. Mackenzie said \\"Bailey is cleaning the pool when Rani comes to see him. Callum sees them talking and assumes the worst.\\" Callum makes \\"a pretty off comment\\" comparing Rani to her mother, who had an affair, which leads to Bailey lunging at Callum. During the confrontation, Bailey and Callum begin shoving each other, which results in Bailey hitting his head, losing consciousness and falling into the pool. As Bailey sinks to the bottom of the pool, Rani manages to snap Callum into action and he pulls Bailey out. Local doctor Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) resuscitates Bailey. Mackenzie commented that his character is in bad shape when he is rushed to hospital. Karl reveals that Bailey has inhaled enough water that could lead to secondary drowning. Baker said Callum feels bad about what happened and he hoped his character would forgive Bailey in the future. Mackenzie said the storyline was a challenge for him, as it was all about the emotion. Bailey and Rani begin dating, but their relationship ends when Rani has to leave Erinsborough. Mackenzie hoped Bailey would get another love interest in the future, as he thought Bailey was \\"a sweet kid\\", who had not had much luck. The actor said it would be good for Bailey to find a nice girl who would not mess him around. Gemma Reeves Bailey struggles following the end of his relationship with Rani, which leaves him vulnerable to manipulation by his teacher Gemma Reeves (Kathryn Beck). Mackenzie believed that Bailey had \\"all this love\\" and no one to give it to, which Gem uses to take advantage of him and cause Bailey to fall in love with her. Mackenzie said that Gem makes Bailey believe that they could be more than just friends, saying it was not \\"your usual teacher/student dynamic.\\" The actor explained that the storyline was a big one for his character, saying \\"after being on the show for a year, this is the storyline I've tackled which has had the most substance. It's the heaviest one we've done for Bailey so far.\\" When Bailey catches Gem rigging the school captain vote, he guilts her into replacing the stolen votes. However, he is not prepared for Gem's \\"sinister\\" comeback when she propositions him into not reporting her to the principal, Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). Continuing her manipulation of Bailey, Gem encourages his crush on her and champions his place on a school trip to China. When she is hospitalised, Gem uses Bailey's concern for her to her advantage. She later tells Bailey that she is withdrawing her support for his place on the China trip, as she cannot bear to be without him for so long. Bailey then becomes \\"smitten\\" with Gem and she realises that she can use his naivety to get him to achieve her own needs. Gem also starts to enjoy Bailey's attention and they develop \\"a firm friendship\\", which results in Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) catching them holding hands at Lassiter's Lake. Imogen reports what she saw to Susan, which causes Gem to threaten her. Bailey eventually sees Gem's nasty side when the other people she has tried to manipulate turn against her. Mackenzie stated \\"As much as Bailey is hurt and distraught that Gem has turned on him, he still really cares about her and wants to be there for her. I think you'll see that Bailey is prepared to forgive her.\\" The actor added that Beck was great to work with during the storyline. Wanting answers for why Gem got him to hack into Kate Ramsay's (Ashleigh Brewer) email account, Bailey convinces Callum to break into her room. There they find Gem's diary, which they read and discover her \\"darkest thoughts and secrets.\\" Despite this, Bailey decides to meet with Gem, against Callum's objections. Bailey sends Gem a text and after she agrees to meet him at the local garden nursery, he sneaks out. At the same time, Matt and Lauren discover his absence and rush to find him. When they get to the nursery, Gem begins to panic and \\"events unravel\\". Mackenzie commented \\"Gem is a loose cannon. She has a dangerous side. The more she's backed into a corner, this side comes out.\\" Teenage alcoholism Producers used Bailey to explore the issues of teenage alcoholism in May 2014. After being bullied at school, Bailey turned to alcohol to cope with the situation. Mackenzie explained that Bailey is targeted by school bully Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham) and through their encounters, Bailey began drinking with him. Eventually Jayden pushed Bailey too far. Mackenzie said Bailey was having \\"a tough time\\" and the drinking was his way of escaping everything. He added \\"It's very dark. He hides his drinking from everyone and it spirals out of control.\\" Mackenzie was happy to receive the serious and emotional storyline for his character. He thought it was quite an unexpected thing for Bailey to do, but realised that it could happen to people who are pushed too far. Mackenzie researched the issues of teenage alcoholism by speaking to friends, who had been through similar issues. The actor found the scenes where he had to pretend to be drunk a challenge. He explained \\"When you are under the influence of alcohol, you are trying to appear normal and look not drunk, so that was a strange one ‚Äì pretending to be drunk while pretending not to be drunk!\\" As the storyline progressed, Bailey befriended Ben Kirk (Felix Mallard), who helped show Bailey a new side to himself. Grief and rebellion After Matt died as a result of injuries he suffered in a hit-and- run, Bailey tried to put on \\"a stoic fa√ßade\\" and helped plan his father's funeral. The family went to Mount Isa to spread Matt's ashes and Lauren hoped it would be \\"emotionally cathartic\\" for Bailey, but upon their return to Erinsborough Bailey became withdrawn. Amber's partner Daniel (Tim Phillipps) tried to help him, but Bailey attacked Daniel, saying he was not part of the family. Bailey then went to Matt's memorial site, where in his grief he trashed the memorial. Lauren noticed Bailey's suspicious behaviour and he told her that he missed his father and could not \\"make sense of the tragedy.\\" Bailey later turned to alcohol to cope with his grief and began hanging out with Jayden again. Bailey became enraged and a fight broke out between him and Jayden, which was witnessed by Susan. Lauren then asked Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) to speak with Bailey, but \\"he throws Brad's advice in his face\\" by telling him that Brad will never replace his father. When Bailey learned that Matt had become corrupt in his last weeks, he got drunk again and used his father's badge to impersonate a police officer. After a failed intervention, Bailey criticises his family and then steals a car. Departure On 27 February 2015, Kilkelly reported Mackenzie had left Neighbours after two years with the show. While an official announcement was not made, Mackenzie's acting school Brave Studios confirmed the news. A Neighbours spokesperson said \\"To ensure our loyal fans experience the full impact of our storylines, we are not confirming the contractual arrangements of current and guest cast.\\" Bailey departed on 1 May 2015, after Lou took him to live with his grandmother Kathy (Tina Bursill) in Queensland, following a period of rebellion caused by his grief for Matt's death. Storylines Bailey moves to Erinsborough with his family and he befriends Rani Kapoor and Callum Jones. Callum warns Bailey away from Rani, as he does not want to compete for her affections. After someone breaks into Number 32, Bailey hides a large sum of money in a garden gnome and keeps guard with a cricket bat through the night. When his brother, Mason, arrives, Bailey tells him that he believes Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko) was behind the break-in. Bailey then explains that following the warehouse robbery involving Mason and Robbo, he found some money in the back of their mother's car and thinks Robbo has come for it. It also emerges that Bailey was caught up in the robbery when he tried to stop Mason, but their father protected him. Bailey and Mason discover the gnome has gone, but they later find it in Sheila Canning's garden and get the money back. After Mason is arrested for another armed robbery, Bailey decides to tell the police about his part in the Mount Isa robbery and he is given a caution. Rani casts Bailey in the lead role of her play. Bailey develops feelings for Rani and they share a kiss. When Callum finds out, he fights with Bailey. Rani reluctantly agrees to stop being friends with Bailey. When Callum catches Rani and Bailey talking, he starts another fight. Callum pushes Bailey, who trips and hits his head, before falling into the pool. Callum pulls Bailey out and Karl Kennedy resuscitates him. Callum repairs his friendship with Bailey and Rani by arranging a date for them. Rani and Bailey's relationship ends when Rani leaves for England. A depressed Bailey allows himself to be manipulated by his teacher, Gem. Gem convinces Bailey to hack into Kate Ramsay's (Ashleigh Brewer) email account, where they find an unsent email detailing her one-night stand with Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan). Gem uses the email to end her cousin, Georgia Brooks' (Saskia Hampele) engagement to Kyle. When Bailey realises that he is culpable in Gem's revenge, he exposes her. Bailey later arranges a meeting and suggests Gem talks to the police. Gem gets angry and leaves. Bailey helps Josie Mackay (Kate Mylius) out with an assignment and they begin dating. When Bailey learns that he has a half-sister that was adopted, he tries to find her. Bailey finds Lisa Tucker (Millie Samuels), who fits the criteria for Lauren's daughter, but a blood test shows she is not related to Lauren. When Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham) challenges Bailey to a fight, Bailey gives him alcohol to get him to change his mind. Jayden later invites Bailey to hang out with him and Bailey gets drunk. Josie breaks up with Bailey and he continues to drink with Jayden and his friends. Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) advises Bailey to stop drinking and helps him hide the fact that he has stolen half of Lou's homemade alcoholic ginger beer. Jayden begins bullying Bailey at school. Paige Novak (Olympia Valance) also realises Bailey has a problem with alcohol and covers for him when he steals from the till at Harold's Store. When Matt and Lauren learn of Bailey's drinking problem, they get Sonya Mitchell (Eve Morey) to counsel him. Paige is revealed to be Lauren's daughter and Bailey is the most accepting of her half-siblings. Bailey applies to space camp and sets up an astronomy club, where he meets his rival Alice Azikiwe (Vivienne Awosoga). Alice and Bailey's rivalry eventually develops into a relationship. Bailey decides to pull out of the interview for space camp for Alice, but she talks him out of it. Alice gets into space camp and their relationship ends when she leaves for the United States. Bailey, Amber and Paige learn that they, along with Mason, own Number 32. Matt and Lauren buy the house from them as they do not want to be their children's tenants. Shortly after, they discover the money for the house has been stolen and Bailey admits that it may be his fault, as he was talking to a Russian girl on the internet and may have downloaded some keylogging software, allowing her to steal the money. Matt blames Bailey for the family's financial problems and Bailey is tempted to drink again. Lauren later finds a bottle of wine in Bailey's bag. Paige encourages Bailey to join Brad Willis' (Kip Gamblin) training session for an upcoming fun-run. Bailey pushes himself too hard and collapses. He recovers and Matt helps him train. Matt dies after being involved in a hit-and-run and Bailey struggles to cope. He lashes out at Daniel Robinson (Tim Phillipps) and then trashes Matt's memorial. Bailey begins drinking again and he lashes out at Jayden and Brad, accusing the latter of trying to take his father's place. After spending the day drinking with Jayden and impersonating a police officer, Bailey lashes out when Lou confronts him, shoving him into the kitchen counter. Lauren later has him charged with impersonating a police officer. Lauren, Paige, Amber and Sonya hold an intervention, but Bailey refuses to listen to them. He later steals a car from the garage. Bailey tells Lou that he wants to get away from the sadness in the house, and he agrees to move to Brisbane with Lou. Reception Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly thought Bailey made \\"a confident\\" entrance to Neighbours. TV Week writer Andrew Mercado was not impressed with Bailey's near drowning, commenting that similar stories had been done in 2011 and 2008. He added \\"Seriously, no-one should swim in Erinsborough unless there's a lifeguard on duty.\\" During the Gem storyline, another TV Week reporter said that \\"an uneasy chemistry\\" had developed between the pair and called Bailey a \\"smitten schoolboy\\". When Bailey noticed Josie, Tony Stewart, writing for the Daily Record, quipped \\"Poor Bailey gets entangled in a teenage crush.\\" Stewart observed \\"Bailey's bubble is shortlived and then burst when Callum insists that it's him who she really fancies and that Josie is just using poor Bailey.\\" A reporter for The Age called Bailey and Alice's romance \\"one of the more satisfying relationships\\" in the show. In 2014, Bailey's space camp ambitions storyline won the Soap Extra Award for Most Out-of-This-World Storyline.

With financial and social support from Harriet Burton Laidlaw and other noted suffragettes, as well as the Rose Livingston Prudential Committee, she worked in New York City's Chinatown and in other cities to rescue girls from forced prostitution, and helped pass the Mann Act to make interstate sex trafficking a federal crime. As a young girl, she was abducted and turned into a sex slave. She was given drugs so that she became addicted to opium and by the time she was sixteen, she had given birth to two children. Livingston was rescued in 1903 and initially thought that she wanted to work overseas as a missionary. She realized, though, that there was a lot of good that she could do in New York. She referred to herself as a missionary and worked nights looking for pre-teen and teenage girls who were forced into sexual slavery. A small and thin woman, she was beaten and shot, sometimes spending months in the hospital recovering from her injuries. Once she rescued girls, she helped them transition into a life of freedom. She lectured about the dangers of children and young women being forced into sex work. She also advocated for women's right to vote. The story of her childhood as a sex slave comes from Rose herself, and there is a conspicuous lack of confirmation of it from other sources, and various small discrepancies in her own accounts. For example, she never refers again to the two children she said she bore. Early life New York City Chinatown decorated for New Year, Jan. 21, 1909 Rose Livingston was born around 1876. She said that she was raised in the Methodist faith. At age 10, she was abducted from her home and forced into prostitution in New York's Chinatown, where she developed an opium addiction. She bore two children to her captors, one when she was 12 and the second at 15. She was rescued in 1903, and came to New York that year. She was initially interested in becoming a foreign missionary, but decided she could be an independent missionary in New York City after she saw a drug-crazed girl being rescued. Life's work Initially, about 1903, Livingstone worked at Sunshine Settlement, a settlement house on Baxter and at 106 Bayard Street in New York City. Established in 1900, Sunshine Settlement helped mothers and poor children by providing health services, education, and \\"healthful\\" visits to the seaside beaches. Gospel services and lectures were performed there. It offered a kindergarten, sewing school, and a library. Clients could request medical and legal advice. It operated through ca. 1911. Activist =Background= In 1934, the New York City police department statistics showed that 4,000 females disappeared from that city each year, and many more disappeared without being reported missing. Girls and women became sexual slaves by being physically kidnapped, drugged, or unknowingly lured into the industry with a promise of a job or an adventure. Many girls that Livingston rescued said something like, \\"I met him and he was nice to me. Then he invited me to go for a ride.\\" Then the girls were handed off to another person who would drug, poison, beat, or otherwise mistreat them. Girls were often transported across state lines. Livingston found that there was an auction on the Lower East Side of New York where girls and women were sold. Their captors often got the girls addicted to drugs, so that it was easier to contain and control them. Ultimately, some girls were rescued and did well, some were rescued but were so broken they had to be institutionalized, some died early, and others remained as captive sex workers. =Rescues= Brooklyn Navy Yards baracks, 1909 Focusing on girls that were nine to seventeen years of age, Livingston made it her life's work to free thousands of girls and women from sexual slavery beginning on March 4, 1903 or about 1904. Her modus operandi was to follow men that were sexual slavers, figure out what females were held captive, make friends with them, and encourage them to escape. She looked for enslaved girls in opium dens, dance halls, and bars, particularly in New York City's Chinatown and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Sometimes she ventured out of the city to Boston, Newark, Bridgeport, New Haven, and Chicago. In 1907, there were 300 girls younger than 18 in Chinatown that were sex workers, out of a total of 800 white slaves. Six years later, she could not find any girls under age 18 there. Miss Rose Livingston, dressed as a man, 1914 She had a masculine looking face and she her hair cut short and wore men's clothing when she went in search of girls to rescue‚Äîso that she could blend in at dance calls and other night spots. After she was able to free girls and young women, she offered rehabilitation, and ministered to them in accordance with her Christian faith. Called the \\"Angel of Chinatown\\", she considered herself a missionary and an independent social worker. She saved an eight-year-old girl who had been kidnapped and taken to Philadelphia, after being asked by her father to find his daughter. There were times when bravery and quick thinking helped her rescue girls, like the time that she saved a girl who was being kidnapped by three men. She motioned that she had a gun in her pocket and waited for the police, who arrested the men. She went on high-speed chases in taxis to save girls. When she rescued girls, she took them to her apartment, rather than the police or the children's society, and contacted the girls' families. She was aware of the fact that it was a difficult process to transition back into a family, so she did not believe in rushing girls back to their parents' homes. Livingston described her brand of missionary work: Fighting the Traffic in Young Girls, \\"a book designed to awaken the sleeping and to protect the innocent\\", according to its title page. By 1934, with over 30 years of experience, Livingston rescued 800, 4,000, or 5,000 girls or young women. Of the girls that she rescued, only two returned to life as a sex worker. If the girl had a baby, in her experience, not one of the girls' families took the baby into the family. Many of the girls she rescued looked on her as a mother, and brought potential husbands to her for approval. The League of Nations identified her as a noted figure in the fight against sexual slavery around the world. She found that there was a world-wide network of trafficking sexual slaves. In a report by the League, She offered solutions to the sexual slavery problem, particularly regarding girls and young women. She asked all women to be more understanding of children, so that they did not want to run away from home. She suggested that cities hire plain-clothed police women to patrol vice-ridden districts to prevent girls from being led into slavery. She asked parents to talk to their daughters about the danger of being taken, without terrorizing them. Livingston stated that she believed that this would dramatically reduce the likelihood of girls being kidnapped by avoiding the first false, reckless step‚Äîlike getting into the car of a stranger. =Financial support= Before the Rose Livingston Committee was established, she received support from Miss Elizabeth Voss, whose father had been the city's District Attorney. The Committee of Fourteen women from Brooklyn supported her. At some point a church in Brooklyn, New York provided for her maintenance. About 1911, she became affiliated with suffragettes who offered her support. A few women met her when she was trying to save a girl from killing herself. They introduced Livingston to Harriet Burton Laidlaw whose husband, James Laidlaw, created the Committee of Three with Rev. M. Sanderson and Lawrence Chamberlain. In the late 1920s or early 1930, her work was sponsored by the Rose Livingston Committee, also called the Rose Livingston Prudential Committee, who paid her $600 a year. She used part of her salary to pay for clothes and food for the girls she rescued. The members of the committee included women, several ministers, and a former assistant district attorney. Livingston was supported, financially and socially, by Harriet Burton Laidlaw, as well as other noted suffragettes across the country, and James Lees Laidlaw. She lectured across the country about the prevalence of white slavery. The Rose Livingston Committee issued an annual report of the freed girls and convicted people who were the slaveholders. =Danger= As she rescued women, she put herself in danger. About five feet tall and weighing about 90 pounds, she faced male procurers, or cadets, as she tried to rescue girls and women. She was severely beaten, shot, wounded, and thrown out windows. In 1912, she was severely beaten, resulting in permanent damage. She had severe neuritis and persistent neuralgic pain due to a fracture of the alveolar process of the upper jaw bone. On one side of her face, she lost of all the teeth of the upper jaw. In 1914, a contract was taken out on her life for $500 (). Once, a few years before 1934, she was hurt so badly trying to save a girl from Boston that she was in the hospital for five months and on crutches for two years. She was pushed from a roof of the red-light district in Brooklyn. By 1933, she had 22 beatings, one of which caused severe injury of her eyes. After a number of operations, her eyesight continued to fail her in the 1930s. She carried a gun with her, but was never known to have shot at anyone. Mann Act Before 1910, it was not illegal to engage in sex trafficking across state lines. Livingston helped pass the Mann Act, that made interstate sex trafficking a federal crime in 1910. Awards A week of testimonial dinners were conducted in 1927 to celebrate the 24 years that she helped girls attain freedom. In 1929, she was awarded a gold medal by the National Institute of Social Sciences, for her \\"unique work and indefatigable faithfulness for almost 30 years.\\" In 1937 she was awarded a silver cup by Mrs. J. Sergeant Cram (Edith Claire Bryce) of the Peace House for her \\"deeds of courage without violence\\". Personal life Unidentified 14-year-old striker, Fola La Follette and Rose Livingston in New York City in 1913 In 1914, she participated in one of the Suffrage Hikes from Manhattan to Albany, New York and over the years, she lectured about women's suffrage. In 1914, she conducted lectures throughout 40 counties of Ohio for the Ohio Woman Suffrage Association to explain to girls the dangers of being led into a life as a sexual worker. In order to search for girls at night, she slept during the day for about three hours. To protect her safety, only her best friends knew her address. For thirty years, from about the time that Livingston was rescued from slavery, she lived in cold water flats and had a very frugal lifestyle. She lived in a three-room flat on E. 49th Street in New York City for 46 years, beginning about 1929. It was near the East River. By 1928, she wore masculine clothing. In 1934, she was found living in poverty, and a retirement fund was established for her. Although she read the Bible and a book on Christian Science, she did not attend church services, unless she had agreed to speak at the church. She did not consider herself a Christian Scientist. Although she was quoted as saying that she was still involved helping girls in 1950, she retired after 1937 and received a pension of $100 per month. She was cared for by neighbors who helped her obtain a supplemental Social Security pension and did chores for her. She particularly needed help once she started to lose her sight. She died on December 26, 1975 at 99 years of age. A rabbi conducted a Jewish service for her, and her friend, an Irish-Catholic, arranged for a mass in her memory.

It was built for William R. Hunter, a prominent lawyer in Kankakee who had previously served as Kankakee City Attorney and would later serve on the 12th Illinois Circuit Court. In 1942, the house was purchased by Kankakee mayor Albert F. Hattenburg. History William R. Hunter was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in 1858. Hunter spent much of his early life helping his father on the family farm. He moved to Kankakee, Illinois, United States in 1879. There, he was schooled by the pastor of the local Baptist Church and trained as a stenographer. While working this profession, he studied law in the office of Judge John W. Orr.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/218212.pdf Hunter was admitted to the bar in 1882, the same year he married his first wife Lillian Morrison. In 1886, after a brief sojourn in Los Angeles, California to recover from bronchitis, Hunter was appointed Kankakee City Attorney. In 1892, he joined Harry K. Wheeler to form a law firm. Lillian died in Colorado Springs, Colorado in January 1893; Hunter married his second wife Zula B. Fry in 1894. By 1898, Hunter had amassed enough of a fortune to build a stately residence on the Kankakee River. The Hunter House cost $6800, three times the average price of a home in Kankakee. In 1933, Hunter was appointed a judge for the 12th Illinois Circuit Court. He served in this role until his death in 1939. Albert F. Hattenburg purchased the house in 1942. Hattenburg moved to Kankakee after World War I and opened the Hattenburg Pharmacy in the Arcade Building. In 1937, Hattenburg was elected mayor of Kankakee as a Republican and served for 16 years.

The path is over in length, connecting Toronto neighbourhoods. An archival community map of the pan am path can be found here. History On July 3, 2013, The city of Toronto's Executive Committee recommended the path as a legacy project. On July 18, 2013, In a 37‚Äì1 vote, Toronto City Council committed to create a continuous trail from Brampton to Rouge River. The original Pan Am Path strategy was to assist the Bikeway Trails Implementation Plan approved by Council on June 6th 2012 by accelerating creation of an east‚Äìwest connection across the city. The first section of Pan Am Path, near Cruickshank Park, was completed on June 21, 2014. Updates on the current East Don build by the TRCA can be found here and upgrading of the Highland Creek Section here. The six of the seven founding members of the Friends of the Pan Am Path group came from CivicAction's DiverseCity Fellows program: Brent Chamberlain, Caitlin McClung, James Gen Meers, Jonathan Asmis, Salim Rachid, and Tanzeel Merchant. Devon Ostrom, a curator, artist and advocate with a history of creating projects in Toronto collaborated with the group on this initiative. As a co-founder, Devon sketched out the original concept, named the project and was Lead Curator from 2012‚Äì2017. Route The Pan Am Path follows existing trails in Toronto and includes plans for new trail connections to complete the continuous route from Brampton to Pickering. Starting from the west near the Claireville Reservoir, the trail follows the Humber Valley Trail southward along the Humber River to Lake Ontario. From there, the trail turns eastward and follows the Martin Goodman Trail through downtown Toronto. A new trail connection will be constructed to connect to the Athletes' Village near the Distillery District and connecting to the Lower Don Valley Trail. The Path then follows the Don River north-east to Taylor-Massey Creek. Another new trail will be constructed along the eastern branch of the Don River, where the Path will connect to the Gatineau Hydro Corridor eastward through Scarborough. Another new trail will connect the Path to the Highland Creek Trail, following the Highland Creek back to Lake Ontario, where the Waterfront Trail completes the Path into Pickering. Prior to the start of the Games in 2015, a temporary route was completed using marked on-street connections in places where the new trail connections had not yet been completed. The Pan Am Path, particularly in the Rexdale area, currently features stations along the path for passersby to try rope climbing and chin-ups.

His great-great-grandfather was Henry Sewall, who immigrated to St. Mary's County, Maryland, in 1660; became Secretary of the Province and Counselor; and received numerous parcels of land from Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. On February 14, 1809, he married Anna Maria Rudulph, daughter of Tobias Rudulph, a large landowner. Together, they had at least four children: James Sewall (1823-1881Death of James M. Sewall, Esq.), Martha, Glenn, and Mary. Career Sewall was the secretary of the Republican Party organization in Cecil County, Maryland, in 1810. In 1811, he was elected president of the first bank in Elkton, Maryland. In 1813, Major Sewall commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 49th Maryland Regiment in action against the British during the War of 1812. On April 29, forces under British Admiral George Cockburn, including nine ships, sailed up the Chesapeake Bay. They sacked Frenchtown, Maryland, but when they attempted to move up the Elk River to Elkton, they were repulsed by Sewall's forces at Fort Defiance, an earthenworks fortification a mile below the town. From 1816 to 1840, Sewall served as Clerk of the Circuit Court in Elkton. In 1817, Sewall led the formation of the Elkton and Susquehanna Bridge Turnpike Company, a firm capitalized at $30,000 to build a road from Elkton to the Susquehanna River. Sometime between 1810 and 1820, Sewall built Holly Hall on land inherited by his wife. The Elkton mansion was the family seat for some decades and in 1976 was added to the National Register of Historic Places. He helped found Trinity Episcopal Church in Elkton in 1832. In the 1830s, he served as a director of the Delaware and Maryland Railroad and the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad, which joined two other railroads to create the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. (The main line survives today as part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.) His service as a railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 13, 1970. It is located on Greene Street and is now a museum.Old Capitol Museum website Georgia's original state capitol was in Louisville, Georgia. On December 12, 1804, the state legislature voted to designate Milledgeville as the capital of Georgia. In 1805, $60,000 was appropriated to build a capitol building; and a planned city with elements of Savannah, Georgia, and Washington D.C., was proposed, for centrally-located Milledgeville. Jett Thomas and John B. Scott were the general contractors for the construction work. The Georgia Legislature met in the yet-to-be-completed building for the first time in 1807. The Marquis de Lafayette visited the building in 1825 while on his tour through the United States. Expansions were completed to north and south wings in 1828 and 1834, respectively. East and west porticoes with granite steps were added in 1835. Georgia's Secession Convention in 1861 was held in the building, and a vote for secession carried on January 19, 1861. Governor Joe Brown worked from the building, conducting the affairs of the state militia and engaging in disputes with C.S.A. President Jefferson Davis from the capitol and the nearby Governor's Mansion. Brown and others fled the capitol ahead of the arrival of General William Tecumseh Sherman's Union Army. They occupied the city of Milledgeville on November 23, 1864. The Old Capitol building was damaged, while armories and magazines on Statehouse Square were destroyed. In 1868, during Reconstruction, the legislature moved the capital to Atlanta, a city emerging as the symbol of the New South as opposed to Milledgeville, seen as being connected to the Old South. The statehouse was used as the court house for Baldwin County, Georgia from 1871 - 1879. Then it was used for the Middle Georgia Military and Agricultural College, which became Georgia Military College in 1900. The building remains the center of the college campus and is open for tours.

He found moral philosophy vague, but excelled at science, in which his lecturers included the young Lord Kelvin. Smith joined the British Army (Royal Engineers) during the Crimean War and out of the 380 candidates who took the entry exam he came first. In September 1855, Smith was gazetted to Lieutenant and in the following October was chosen to lead a small group of Royal Engineers bound to help Charles Thomas Newton's archaeological mission to the remains of the ancient civilisation at Knidos in Turkey. Archaeology The Apollo of Cyrene was found in 121 pieces by Smith. It is 2.29 metres tall.

Roger T. Stearn, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 2 Dec 2013 The limestone core of a monument was still there but the marble had been moved or stolen. Other pieces of worked stone lay around where they had been abandoned. Smith was able to replace, examine and move each of the remaining stones, and to create a detailed report on the supposed construction and its historical context. This allowed Pullen to sketch what is thought to be a good reproduction of what the whole mausoleum would have looked like. The Lion of Knidos was loaded onto the naval ship HMS Supply and shipped to London, where it is now held in the British Museum. Smith was very interested in archaeology and he decided to fund another two-year expedition to excavate the lost settlements of Cyrenaica in North Africa. The British government had permitted this expedition and when Smith and Lieutenant E. A. Porcher returned they deposited a large quantity of Cyrene sculptures and artefacts in the British Museum. This included the high Apollo of Cyrene which they found in 121 pieces. They moved the pieces away secretly, fearing the marble fragments would be further destroyed by the locals because the sculpture was non-Islamic.The Cyrene Apollo, Peter Higgs, History Today, Vol. 44, No. 11.

He obtained this appointment following two years he spent assisting with the difficult task of installing the 1,200-mile- long wire required to join Tehran to London.

Stanley studied the biogeography, ecology, evolution, and systematics of shrews, bats and rodents that live on mountains within Tanzania and surrounding countries.  Biography & notable contributions  Stanley and colleagues discovered multiple species new to science, including shrews, bats, rodents, frogs and primates while surveying the fauna of the Eastern Arc Mountains. Stanley led the first ever mammal surveys of various mountains in Tanzania, including Kilimanjaro, Meru, Ngorongoro, Udzungwa, and Rungwe . Two notable discoveries include the kipunji, the first new genus of African monkey in nearly 100 years, and Thor's Hero Shrew, the second species of mammal with a bizarre spinal morphology. Stanley created the innovative bi-lingual \\"Mammals of Tanzania\\" website that provides identification tools in English and Kiswahili for skulls and skins of mammals of the country.

It was in operation as a hotel as early as 1844. The building had been in poor repair for a number of years and was added to a list of the most endangered historic places in Texas in 2012. In 2013, the structure came under new ownership and was being restored for use as a private residence. As of 2019, The Magnolia Hotel is a fully functioning hotel that can be rented out nightly. Tours are also given. It is touted as one of the most haunted hotels in Texas, and many ghost-hunting television shows have been hosted there. History During the Republic of Texas, a two-room log cabin in Seguin, Texas, sheltered travelers on the frontier as early as 1844, and became known as the Magnolia Hotel. An adjoining concrete building was erected by early 1846, and a larger, two-story frame building replaced the log cabin by 1853. The Magnolia Hotel was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey (H.A.B.S.) in 1934, and contributes to the Seguin Commercial Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The Magnolia's limecrete section was built by John Park, a chemist and doctor who experimented with concrete after moving to Seguin in 1846. The hotel was the first 'Park's concrete' building in town, and is surely the oldest still standing. Park's work, with his imitators and rivals, led to Seguin having the largest concentration of mid-19th century concrete structures in the United States. The dating of the concrete hotel is established because Captain Jack Hays, \\"perhaps the most famous Texas Ranger\\" according to Willie Mae Weinert's Authentic History of Guadalupe County, married Susan Calvert, daughter of Jeremiah Strother Calvert, the hotel's owner, \\"in the south room of the concrete portion of the hotel on April 29, 1847, Rev. John M. McCulloch presiding.\\" Park's concrete building was next to a two-room cabin built of logs originally gathered by Seguin citizens to build a stockade as defense against possible Indian raids. The logs were instead sold to Texas Ranger James Campbell, and his cabin became the point of defense. The two-story frame building that now sits atop the large basement, replacing the Campbell cabin, dates from the early 1850s. It shows graceful Greek Revival symmetry and detailing around the door, and a roof line similar to that of the concrete house known as Sebastopol built 1854‚Äì56. Frederick Law Olmsted passed through Seguin in February 1854, and wrote about the town's many concrete buildings, noting, \\"The hotel is large and good.\\" That he made no mention of the hotel itself being of concrete implies that he was referring to the much larger wooden building, dating it to about 1853. Jeremiah Calvert sold the property to Dr. William Read, a dentist who operated the hotel from 1850 to 1860, then Colonel Thomas Dickey Johnson and Katherine Calvert Johnston owned it until 1900. Together they encompassed the years when the Magnolia served as an overnight stop for stagecoaches making their runs from the coastal ports to San Antonio and points west. A young slave rang a bell to announce the stage's arrival, to summon guests at mealtime, and in emergencies. The stone the youngster stood on remains in place. The bell actually came from the Alamo, having been found in the San Antonio River in 1845 then brought to the hotel by John Twohig, and was used at the Magnolia until about 1900. A Seguin woman purchased the bell and donated it to the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, then the managers of the Alamo shrine. During the stagecoach years, from 1848 to about 1880, the Magnolia served as the stagecoach stop in Seguin. As such, the hotel served as a center of social life in the town, serving food, drink and hosting dances in the ballroom. Rival hotels, constructed of brick and boasting of \\"fire-proof\\" construction, opened in the last decade of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century displaced the Magnolia as the premier lodging in town. In the 1930s, the property was bought by the Lannom couple, who lived downstairs and operated with small apartments upstairs for another 65 years or so. The building fell into disrepair, leading Preservation Texas to list it among the state's \\"Most Endangered Historic Places\\" in March 2012. On March 1, 2013, Jim Ghedi and Erin O Wallace-Ghedi purchased the building and have privately funded the restoration bringing it back to its original state. It now has become a private museum and personal residence to the Ghedis. Though much of the building remains a work in progress, the bottom floor has been fully renovated. The building was visited by the Ghost Adventures TV show.http://seguingazette.com/article_ee0626fe-75e2-11e1-809e-0019bb2963f4.html?mode=image&photo;=%27 References Buildings and structures in Guadalupe County, Texas Seguin, Texas 1847 establishments in Texas ","title":"Magnolia Hotel (Seguin, Texas)"},{"id":"41249657","text":"Middle Fork Township may refer to the following townships in the United States:  Iowa  * Middle Fork Township, Ringgold County, Iowa  North Carolina  * Middle Fork Township, Forsyth County, North Carolina * Middle Fork I Township, Forsyth County, North Carolina * Middle Fork II Township, Forsyth County, North Carolina ","title":"Middle Fork Township"},{"id":"41249726","text":"The epithet the Angel may refer to: *Francita Alavez, Angel of Goliad. *Maura Clarke, Angel of the Land. *Clara Barton, Angel of the Battlefield. *Donaldina Cameron (1869‚Äì1968), Angry Angel of Chinatown. *Rose Livingston, Angel of Chinatown. *Billie Holiday, Angel of Harlem See also *Angel of Death (disambiguation) *Angel of Harlem References Lists of people by nickname ","title":"List of people known as the Angel"},{"id":"41249743","text":"Miracle of the cruse of oil () is an Aggadah depicted in the Babylonian Talmud as one of the reasons for Hanukkah. The story of the miracle, as described in the Talmud, occurred after the liberation of the Temple in Jerusalem during the Maccabean Revolt, and describes how the finding of a jug of pure oil that was to be enough to light the lamp for one day; instead, it lasted for eight days.  Historical background   The Maccabees  During the period of the second temple (~516 BCE-70CE), in around 200 B.C., Antiochus III, the Seleucid king of Syria, took control over the kingdom of Judea. He allowed the Jews living in Judea autonomous rule for some time, but then his son Antiochus IV replaced him. Trying to unify his kingdom, Antiochus IV prohibited Jews from practicing Judaism and commanded them to worship Greek gods. Many Jews went along with these demands and were known as Hellenized Jews. Tensions rose and in 168 BCE Antiochus IV invaded Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, killing thousands, and erected an altar for Zeus in the Holy Temple. This resulted in a Jewish revolt led by the priest Matityahu of Modiin. These rebels were known as the Hasmoneans or Maccabees. After two years of guerrilla warfare, they were able to push out a much larger and well equipped Greek army. After retaking Jerusalem, the Jews cleared out the Temple and rededicated it. One of the main aspects of the rededication was the lighting of the Menorah. However, there remained one cruse of oil which had not been defiled, and contained enough oil to last only one night. Miraculously, the one cruse of oil lasted eight nights.  Temple Menorah  The Torah discusses the lighting of the Temple menorah in a number of verses. specifies that pure olive oil must be used to light the menorah. While and speak of seven lights being lit, and specifies that a single \\"light\\" must be lit \\"continually\\", and must burn \\"from evening to morning\\". Thus, according to Jewish tradition, priests ensured that all seven menorah lights were lit during the day, while just one of them (the ner maaravi or ner tamid) burned through the entire night.  Significance of the 8 days  After defeating the Syrian-Greeks in the battlefield, the first of the two miracles celebrated on Hanukkah, the Maccabees returned to Jerusalem and to the Temple. There, they wanted to rededicate the Temple through the resumption of the performance of Temple rituals. One of these rituals was the lighting of the Menorah, however the Menorah could only be lit with pure olive oil. When the Greeks entered the Temple they had defiled almost all the jugs of oil.Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Shabbat 21b As the Maccabees searched for pure oil to light the menorah with, they found just one cruse of pure oil which still had the seal of the High Priest, the symbol of pure oil. This cruse contained just enough pure oil to keep the menorah lit for one day. In order to make pure oil however, individuals making the oil must be in a state of spiritual purity. Being soldiers returning from the battlefield, the Maccabees were deemed impure, and therefore could not make pure oil. Since the process of ritual purification after touching a corpse lasts seven days, the Maccabees could only produce additional pure oil after eight days: seven days of becoming pure including one day, once pure, to actually make the oil. Therefore, the Maccabees would have been unable to light the Menorah for seven days before the completion of new pure oil. Miraculously, the one cruse of oil had lasted for all eight days, and by that point new pure oil was ready. R' Joseph Karo is known for asking why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days, if the oil was expected to last one day, so seemingly only the last seven days were miraculous. This question became famous and many answers were suggested to it; indeed a book was published in 1962 compiling 100 different proposed answers. The answers generally fall into three categories: arguing that the oil miracle actually lasted eight days in some way; arguing that the eighth day is celebrated for a reason other than the oil miracle; and arguing that the eight-day length of Hanukkah is unrelated to the oil miracle.The Question With 100 Answers  Hanukkah  The Talmud, after recounting the story of the miracle of the cruse of oil, continues to pronounce, ‚ÄúThe following year these [days] were appointed a Festival with [the recital of] Hallel (Jewish praise, recited on all festivals) and thanksgiving.‚Äù Since then, the festival of Hanukkah each year, beginning on the 25th of Kislev. During these days, lamentation for the dead and fasting are forbidden, Hallel is recited, and the Menorah is lit. While lighting the Menorah on Hanukkah was originally established solely to commemorate the miracle of the cruse oil, after the destruction of the Second Temple, the holiday took on an additional role. It now also serves as a commemoration of the daily lighting of the Menorah in the Temple, and the Temple in general. Today, the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah lasts eight days to remember, and celebrate, the miracle of the one cruse of oil lasting eight days. One candle is lit on the first night, and a candle is added each night. Ultimately, eight candles are lit on the final night of the holiday. Traditionally, after the lighting of the Menorah, Ma'oz Tzur is sung in honor of the holiday. Latkes, among other oily food, are also eaten on Hanukkah in honor of the miracle of the cruse of oil.

He was one of the lawyers working for James J. Hill's defense team in the Minnesota Rate Cases. In later years he served as a director for a number of large companies including American Telephone & Telegraph, New York Life Insurance Company and the Chemical Bank & Trust.  Early life Hale Holden was born on August 11, 1869, in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Howard Malcomb and Mary Finley (Oburn) Holden. He received his education at Williams College (graduated 1890) and Harvard Law School (entered September 22, 1890; left 1892). Although he graduated from Williams College, he was forced to withdraw from Harvard due to family finances. Career Holden practiced law as a partner in Dean, McLeod & Holden in Kansas City; it was his work in this company as a local attorney for the Great Northern Railway during the Minnesota Rate Cases before the Supreme Court that influenced James J. Hill in his favor.  Railroad career  Hale Holden (left) and Fairfax Harrison, who was president of Southern Railway and an executive with the American Railway Association, in 1917. In 1907, Holden left private law practice to become the general attorney for CB&Q;, where his first assignments were to manage the railroad's interstate commerce litigation. 1910 saw a number of changes to the CB&Q; leadership team, first with vice president Daniel Willard leaving the CB&Q; to become president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which led to Darius Miller's post being extended to include Willard's former position; then when George Harris resigned a few weeks later, Miller assumed the presidency and Holden became Miller's assistant. Holden was promoted to vice president on November 8, 1910. Following the sudden death of Darius Miller in 1914 from appendicitis, Holden assumed the presidency of the CB&Q.; As one of his last statements, Miller was reported to have asked Louis W. Hill to recommend Holden to James J. Hill as Miller's selection for his successor; Holden was elected president by the railroad's board of directors at a meeting on August 27, 1914, immediately after Miller's funeral. At the time, Holden was the youngest chief executive, at age 45, of any American railroad. When World War I began and American railroads were brought under the control of the United States Railroad Administration (USRA), Holden was asked to head the USRA but declined the top position, opting instead to assist incumbent director William Gibbs McAdoo. In 1918, Holden stepped down from the CB&Q; presidency (to be succeeded by Charles Elliott Perkins, Jr., the son of Charles Elliott Perkins) to become USRA's central western region director, then returned to the presidency of the CB&Q; in 1920, serving for another nine years. Also in 1918, Holden was appointed as vice president and director of the American Railway Association, where he served until 1924. He also served from 1922 to 1924 as chairman of the executive committee for Association of Railroad Executives. In the 1920s, Holden advocated, including testifying before the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1922 and 1923, for the consolidation of the railroads in the western United States into four large systems: the Hill railroads (which included Great Northern Railway, Northern Pacific Railroad and Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad), Union Pacific Railroad, Santa Fe Railroad, and Southern Pacific Railroad. In 1929, leaving the CB&Q; again (to be succeeded by Frederick E. Williamson), Holden became chairman of the executive committee for Southern Pacific Railroad (succeeding Henry deForest); he was promoted to chairman of the Southern Pacific in 1932, and finally retired in 1939. Since the Southern Pacific management team was based in New York, Holden also maintained an apartment there at 610 Park Avenue in addition to his home in Chicago.  Personal life  On September 18, 1895, he married Ellen Mitchell Weston, daughter of Byron Weston and Julia (n√©e Mitchell) Weston, in Dalton, Massachusetts, with whom he had two sons and one daughter. His son Hale Holden, Jr., (born in 1900) became an executive with the Pullman Company. Holden was preceded in death by his wife Ellen on October 22, 1936, in Chicago; she was buried in Dalton, Massachusetts. After her death, he moved to New York City, taking up residence on East 72nd Street in Manhattan. Hale Holden died on September 23, 1940, in New York. He was survived by his three children, a sister and a brother.

These milefortlets and intervening stone watchtowers extended from the western end of Hadrian's Wall, along the Cumbrian coast and were linked by a wooden palisade. They were contemporary with defensive structures on Hadrian's Wall. Milefortlet 25 is the southernmost known of the fortlets of the Cumberland coast, but there is nothing to see on the ground, as Milefortlet 25 lies in an industrial area of Maryport. Description Milefortlet 25 is in the southern part of the town of Maryport near a modern industrial zone. There are no visible remains and the area is built upon. The fortlet is about 2 kilometers southwest of the Roman fort of Alauna. At one time this fortlet was known as Milefortlet 26, on the assumption that there had been a dislocation of the pattern of fortlets and towers due to the presence of the Alauna fort. Archaeologist Richard Bellhouse proposed that Towers 23B and 24A were the same as two of the fort's angle-towers. This meant that he suppressed Milefortlet 24 and numbered the two fortlets south of Alauna as Milefortlets 25 and 26. Archaeologists no longer accept this break in the sequence, and this final fortlet is now known as Milefortlet 25.  Associated Towers  Each milefortlet had two associated towers, similar in construction to the turrets built along Hadrian's Wall. These towers were positioned approximately one- third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milefortlet, and would probably have been manned by part of the nearest Milefortlet's garrison. The towers associated with Milefortlet 25 are known as Tower 25A () and Tower 25B (). Tower 25A is situated near the cliff edge at the summit of Rise How Bank. It was excavated in 1969 and again in 1981/82 by Richard Bellhouse. It was his predicted position for Milefortlet 26, but the excavations showed that the structure was a tower (Tower 26A in Bellhouse's system). The tower was 6 metres square with stone walls nearly 1 metre wide. The buried remains included a pre-Roman burial mound, and an early-medieval grain drying kiln constructed within the abandoned tower. The foundations of Tower 25B were discovered in 1880 during the building of a coke oven. The building measured 4 metres square (internally), with walls around 1 metre wide. There was a clay covered cobbled floor, on which pottery fragments were found. The site now lies beneath a reclaimed coal tip which is grassed over. The tower is the final one known in the Cumbrian frontier system.

It stars Jim O'Rear, Noah East, Raymond Kester, Donald A. Becker, James Copeland, and Mark A. Nash. East plays an office worker who must defend himself against zombies, unhelpful co-workers, and annoying party entertainers.  Plot  On his first day at a new job at a local metal company, Andy attends the boring retirement party of a manager. The party includes clowns, mimes, and magicians, all of whom are eccentric and annoy the office workers. However, the frustrated office workers are soon put into an even worse situation when zombies attack the building.  Cast  * Jim O'Rear as Adam Cadabra * Noah East as Andy * Raymond Kester as Terry * Donald A. Becker as Steve * James Copeland as Ronnie * Mark A.

The film was shot in four days, and they needed to shoot 20 pages a day in order to stay on schedule. Jim O'Rear heard about the film and joined about a month prior to filming. The film was originally envisioned as a web series, but they decided that the story was better suited to a feature film. The first day of filming was March 13, 2010, and it included use of local Indiana locations, such as a scrap yard.  Release  On October 29, 2010, Beverly Lane premiered in Noblesville, Indiana. It included a costume contest and prizes. It was released on DVD October 25, 2011. It also played at Gen Con in 2011.  Reception  Mark L.

It is a popular and common street food snack in the coastal and other areas of Turkey such as Istanbul, ƒ∞zmir and Bodrum. Midye dolma is sold at all hours and is normally eaten with lemon juice freshly squeezed over them so that the mussel and rice are not dry and the spices are easily mixed and tasted.  History  The historical preparation of the midye dolma is generally attributed to Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. According to TH. Maggakis' 1888 work Bizans Salnamesi Armenians had used big mussels and prepared the dish using sheep's tail fat or \\"zibir yaƒüƒ±\\", a solid fat imported from Siberia. Balƒ±khane Nazƒ±rƒ± Ali Rƒ±za Bey (1842-1928) also notes that in brickworks owner ≈ûahbaz Efendi's Armenian cook was preparing stuffed mussels. During the 19th century it was reported that ƒ∞stanbulite Turkish women were also cooking stuffed mussels. In the 1960s midye dolma preparation and business has become to be dominated by immigrants from Mardin, who had at the time recently immigrated to ƒ∞stanbul's Galata district. In the following decades they have kept the market share and today, most of the food carts are still being operated by people from Mardin. It was noted that there are flavor differences between Armenian-style and Mardin- style stuffed mussels, the latter being more spicy.  Contamination and pollution  In a 2020 study that examined the presence of microplastics (MP) in stuffed mussels sold in 5 Turkish cities, it has been reported that 100 grams of stuffed mussels on average contained around 5.8 MP pieces. The study also concluded that ƒ∞stanbul had the highest MP quantity per mussel. A study from 2011 reported that approximately 50% of samples of street bought mussels from Ankara were not suitable for consumption in accordance with Turkish Food Codex due to the Salmonella sp. content. The study also found out that 30% of the samples were contaminated with E. coli, 80% with B. cereus, 76.6% with S. aureus and 13.3% with Clostridium perfringens and were not suitable for consumption. Another study from 2007 showed that both lemon juice and lemon dressing use caused slight decrease in Salmonella Typhimurium as an immediate inhibitor, and this effect increased by time.

Inspired by the life of Suzanne de Roug√© du Plessis-Belli√®re, known as the Marquise du Plessis-Belli√®re. The novel is set during the Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678). Ang√©lique's marriage to Jeoffrey de Peyrac is thought to be parallel to that of the daughter of Madame de S√©vign√©, Fran√ßoise-Marguerite de S√©vign√© to the Comte de Grignan. There are some parallels between the career of Ang√©lique's second husband, Philippe de Plessis du Belli√®re, and that of the historical Comte d'Artagnan, well-known through his fictionalized depiction in Alexandre Dumas's The Three Musketeers and its sequels. In 1966, the book was adapted into a film titled Angelique and the King. Plot summary After many trials, Angelique finally takes her place in Louis XIV's court alongside her new husband, who is the Marshal of France, Philippe de Plessis du Belli√®re. She has many problems with her new husband, who despises her for having blackmailed him into marriage. Eventually, she starts loving him (and vice versa) but he gets killed in the King's war at the Low Countries.

He first studied theology, but quickly grew dissatisfied with religious life and took up medicine. He first studied at Bern, then completed an internship in Z√ºrich. Niehans joined the Swiss Army in 1912. When war broke out in the Balkans, Niehans set up a hospital in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Intrigued with Alexis Carrel's experiments, Niehans specialized in glandular transplants and by 1925 was one of the leading glandular surgeons in Europe. In 1931, Niehans treated a patient suffering from tetany whose parathyroid had been erroneously removed by another physician. Too weak for a glandular transplant, the patient was given injections of the parathyroid glands of steer, and she soon recovered. In 1937, influenced by the work of the neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing, Niehans first used cerebral cells, from the hypothalamus and the hypophysis. Beginning in 1948, he also used liver, pancreas, kidney, heart, duodenum, thymus, and spleen cells. In 1949, he began to use lyophilized (freeze-dried) cells, not only fresh ones. In 1953, Paul Niehans treated Pope Pius XII, who in gratitude appointed him member of the Papal Academy of Sciences. In the United States, it is not legally available because of safety concerns and lack of proof of its effectiveness.American Cancer Society cell therapy page Fresh cell therapy Fresh cell therapy (also known as cellular therapy or live cell therapy), developed in the 1930s by Niehans, involves harvesting fresh cells from sheep (New Zealand Black Sheep, is the breed he used) embryo and injecting them directly (intramuscular) into the person‚Äôs buttocks.Live cell therapy todayFresh cell therapy: The medicine of the future? There is no evidence it is useful for any health problem. There have been several instances of severe adverse effects including death. Niehans promoted fresh cell therapy as a cancer treatment. In 1963, the American Cancer Society investigated and found \\"no evidence that treatment with the Fresh Cell Therapy or \\"CT\\" results in any objective benefit in the treatment.\\" Fresh cell therapy is considered an unproven method of cancer treatment and quackery by medical experts.\\"Fresh cell therapy\\".

Introduction After the proclamation of Uzbekistan's independence in September 1991, \\"Lenin Square\\" was renamed in 1992 as \\"Mustaqillik Maydoni\\", which translates to \\"Independence Square\\" in English. The monument to Lenin was dismantled, and in its place the Monument of Independence of Uzbekistan, in the form of the globe, was erected. Later, in front of the pedestal was set a figure of a woman, symbolising the Motherland. Independence Square is now the central square of Tashkent; it hosts celebrations and military parades in the days of special events and public holidays. History The largest square in Tashkent is more like a large park than a square. With several monuments and fountains, surrounded by impressive public buildings and filled with trees and flower beds, the Independence Square in Tashkent is a showcase of modern Uzbekistan. Today the Independence History consists of several areas: administrative buildings, the recreation area with green zones and fountains, monuments including the Arch of Independence and the Independence Monument. The story of the Independence square as a center of Tashkent goes back to more than hundred years. The General Governor of Turkestan built his military fortress in 1865. Since 1974 this place was called the Avenue of Parades, where military parades and demonstrations of workers were held to celebrate the holidays of May 1, International Workers Day, May 9 - Victory Day and November 7 - Revolution Day. Passing through the arch of silver with figures of storks around the fountain, which marks the entrance to the Independence Square, one can see the main monument of the Independence square - the Independence Monument. It is a high pedestal with a golden globe erected on the top with a visual rendering of a map of Uzbekistan. Before the pedestal there is a statue of a seated mother with a baby in her arms. The monumental complex represent the revival of Uzbekistan as a free independent state. The Monument of Independence was erected in 1992, and the complete reconstruction of the area was completed in 2006. On the opposite sits a statue depicting a mourning mother sadly looking down onto an eternal flame in memory of her children who fell when defending the country, to commemorate the fallen unidentified soldiers in the past World Wars. Administrative buildings, including the Cabinet of Ministers, Senate of Uzbekistan and the Ministry of Finance are located on the western side of the Independence square in Tashkent.

And won three Kerala State Film Awards including Best Popular Film, Best Actress for Nazriya Nazim and Best Editor for Lijo Paul. Plot The film begins in 1983 as Dr. Mathew Devasya (Renji Panicker) anxiously paces the hall outside of a delivery room. He learns that his wife has delivered a baby boy and thanks God for the good news. A stranger comments that Mathew was lucky the baby was not a girl, as he would have had to worry about her all his life. As the stranger says this, a nurse comes out of the delivery room carrying the baby, apologizing that she made a mistake, and confirming that the baby is actually a girl. Mathew glares at the stranger and praises God once again. The story resumes in 1999 where the baby girl, Pooja Mathew (Nazriya Nazim), is now a seventeen year old tomboy in grade 12. She introduces the audience to her parents. Her father is a doctor by profession and enjoys recording and listening to his own renditions of songs. Her mother, a college lecturer by profession, is a sweet and down-to-earth woman who loves cooking and appreciating her own culinary skills. Pooja also has two friends: Neetu (Akshaya Premnath), a flirt, and Donna (Oshein Mertil), a foodie. Pooja recounts her childhood memories of being a tomboy, riding a motorbike, and of her friendship with Rachel Aunty (Vinaya Prasad) who makes and sells wine as her job. Pooja is her official wine taster. During one of their meetings, she tells Pooja that she can either choose to marry a man she loves or learn to love a stranger that she is forced to marry through arranged marriage. Because of her advice, Pooja decides that she must find someone to love herself. She settles on Yardley (Harikrishnan), a popular boy in her school. During a school trip, Yardley approaches Pooja with a proposal of marriage. Pooja ponders whether or not to accept. The next day, she and her friends are harassed by a gang of men. Pooja gets angry and gets into a fight with them. When one of the gang twists her arm, a man named Giri (Nivin Pauly) appears and saves her. Pooja instantly falls for Giri and immediately rejects Yardley, explaining that she cannot accept his proposal as she does not have romantic feelings for him. Over the course of the rest of the film, Pooja constantly tries to attract the attention of and learn more about Giri, who has now graduated from college and lives as a part-time farmer and teacher of a Kung Fu Academy. At one point, she learns from her cousin David Kaanjani (Aju Varghese) that her other cousin (and Kaanjani's sister), Julie (Poojitha Menon), used to be Giri's girlfriend, but was married off to another man from the US by David and Julie's father, resulting in enmity between Giri and David. She also learns from Rachel that Giri had been considered as a good suitor to her daughter Helen as well. The year is 2000. On Giri's birthday, which also happens to be a Palm Sunday, Pooja decides that she will confess to him with a locket. When she visits him, it begins to rain and they take shelter in a temple. However, when Pooja tries to declare her love, Giri cuts her off. Telling her that she is just a kid and that she needs to concentrate on her studies because she is destined to become successful, he rejects her. Pooja drops the locket, and leaves Giri behind into the rain in tears. Pooja is distraught by Giri's rejection, but focuses on her studies as Giri had requested. She passes her medical entrance exams and goes to Kozhikode Medical College. Pooja tries to contact Giri before leaving, but learns that he is visiting China on a Kung Fu Academy trip. Actress Teenu did the role of the Chinese woman who appears as Giri's wife during a dream Pooja had. At the medical college, she is still friends with Neetu, and another student, Anna (Anju Kurian). She also befriends a young professor, Dr. Prasad Varkey (Vineeth Srinivasan). During her final year in 2005-06, she runs into Giri again. She confides in Dr. Prasad about Giri and he advises her that enough time has passed and she should pursue him if she is still interested. When Giri's mother is admitted to the hospital, Pooja takes care of her in an effort to get closer to Giri. When Giri's friend Thennal (Nikki Galrani) comes to visit, Pooja thinks they are in a relationship and becomes jealous, until she learns that Thennal is already married. Pooja comes home to stay with her parents and continues her pursuit of Giri by helping him with his social activities like performing community weddings. Now Giri is 28 and Pooja is 21. During this time, she surprises him by helping to publish a book his mother wrote. Though Pooja thinks Giri has started to care for her, she is heartbroken to learn that Giri is engaged to Sreelakshmi (Nimisha Suresh), one of their childhood friends. She learns that David had betrayed Giri in their college days, hence David runs away whenever he sees Giri. One day after Church, David asks Pooja and Giri to help him elope with his love interest Nazeema. After they help him, David gives Giri a letter, telling him only to read it after they've left. When Giri opens the letter, he finds out that Kaanjani had actually eloped with Sreelakshmi. Later, Rachel gestures Pooja towards Giri. They go to the same place where Pooja had first proposed to Giri. As she walks up to Giri, he admits that he has loved her all along. He reveals that he kept some memories like the locket that Pooja originally meant to give him.

The technology treadmill theory was first described by Willard Cochrane in 1958 to explain the increasing land consolidation and ownership of farms and to show how the treadmill creates incentives for people to leave farming and become landowners.  History  The technology treadmill begins when a small number of farmers adopt new technology early. These farmers make profits for a short while because their production costs are lower than other farmers. As more farmers get on the treadmill and adopt the technology, overall production goes up, prices go down, and profits are no longer possible ‚Äì even with the lower production costs. Consequently, new technology must be created to make profits possible again. Furthermore, the remaining farmers are forced to sell their products at lower prices and if they want to remain competitive. Those farmers who do not get on the treadmill go down in the price squeeze and the more successful farmers expand over them.

Education Hanohano earned her AD in political science from Hawaii Community College, her BA in sociology from the University of Hawaii at Hilo, and earned her MBA from the University of Phoenix. Elections *2006 When Democratic Representative Helene Hale retired and left the District 4 seat open, Hanohano won the four- way September 26, 2006 Democratic Primary with 1,183 votes (26.0%), and won the three-way November 7, 2006 General election with 3,307 votes (48.6%) against Republican nominee Brian Jordan and Libertarian candidate Aaron Anderson, both of whom had previously sought the seat. *2008 Hanohano won the three-way September 20, 2008 Democratic Primary with 1,934 votes (42.7%), and won the November 4, 2008 General election with 5,324 votes (50.9%) against Republican nominee Fred Blas. *2010 Hanohano won the September 18, 2010 Democratic Primary with 2,314 votes (47.4%), and won the November 2, 2010 General election with 4,438 votes (54.0%) against Republican nominee Marlene Hapai. *2012 Hanohano was unopposed for the August 11, 2012 Democratic Primary, winning with 3,373 votes, and won the November 6, 2012 General election against a nonpartisan candidate. *2014 Hanohano ran for re-election, but lost in the democratic primary to Joy A. San Buenaventura, garnering 766 votes (20.4%) versus her opponent's 1,628 votes (43.4%). The loss came after Hanohano was involved in a pair of racially charged incidents that garnered widespread local news coverage. *2018 Hanohano attempted to win election as a Trustee to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. She advanced through the primary but failed to gain one of three open seats in the general election, finishing sixth. Controversies In 2013, Hanohano became offended as workers for Hawaii's State Foundation on Culture and the Arts were hanging several works of art in her capitol office. Hanohano confronted the workers, stating that she did not want any art created by \\"Haoles, Japs or Pakes\\" and threatened to cut the department's funding. She later apologized for the racially charged comments in a speech before the House of Representatives whose sincerity would be questioned by local observers. In 2014, Hanohano again faced controversy over racially insensitive comments, this time on the floor of the House. During a meeting of the Ocean Management and Hawaiian Affairs committee that she chairs, Rep. Hanohano responded to testimony of Hawaii Pacific University student Aarin Jacobs about measures to protect sea life by angrily demanding to know why \\"all of you westerners want to come over here and tell us what to do\\". It was reported on March 1, 2014, that the Hawaiian House of Representatives has launched an investigation into the matter, but that Rep. Hanohano had refused to apologize for the remark.

Pumpkin ale may be produced using pumpkin flesh in combination with malt or other more typical beer grains as a portion of the mash bill, contributing fermentable sugars to the wort. It may also be produced by adding natural or artificial flavor to a finished beer. Spice flavor may be added to evoke the flavor of pumpkin pie, a popular American wintertime dessert. Many styles of pumpkin ale are produced, including pale ales, wheat beers, porters, and stouts. Often produced as a seasonal beer in the fall, it is produced by several breweries including Sea Dog Brewery, Shipyard Brewing Company, Saint Arnold Brewing Company and Blue Moon. History The brewing of beer with pumpkin in the United States dates back to 1771. The first commercially brewed pumpkin ale came from Buffalo Bill's Brewery in Hayward, California, in the 1980s, the recipe based on brewing studies made by George Washington. The beer's contemporary popularity has been described as part of a \\"pumpkin spice craze,\\" initiated by a rash of pumpkin- and pumpkin-spice-flavored consumer food products, such as the Pumpkin Spice Latte.

It is commonly referred to as jalap. Description Ipomoea purga is described as a vine that can reach heights of . When fresh, the root is black externally, white and milky within, and varies in size according to its age. It has heart shaped leaves and purple trumpet like flowers. Ipomoea purga is rather difficult to break down, but if triturated with cream of tartar, sugar of milk, or other hard salts, the process of pulverization is much easier, and the powder rendered much finer. When in powder form in order to ingest, the color is a pale grayish brown. Ipomoea purga is native to Mexico and it is naturalized in other parts of the neotropics. Discovery Ipomoea purga was discovered by Spanish conquistadores while settling among Mexican native peoples. It was introduced to Europe in 1565 as a medical herb used to treat an array of illnesses up until the 19th century when better medical practices had been discovered. Medical uses The root contains convolvulin, which is a powerful cathartic (see jalap). It is used to prevent diarrhea, but large amounts will induce vomiting. When applied to a wound, it is said to induce purgation. Chemical composition Ipomoea purga resin can be dissolved in either alcohol or diethyl ether. The resin that is insoluble in ether is odorless while the resin insoluble in alcohol does have an odor and is typically a brownish color. The convolvulinolic acid (C28H52O14)that is produced in Ipomoea purga can be broken down into a sugar molecule (C6H12O6) and a form of crystallized convolvulinolic acid (C16H30O3) when diluted.

It became a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural site on 3 June 1931 and was restored in 1971. History There is some confusion regarding the origin of the monastery. According to local legend, the relics of St Saturnin arrived at the site during the 6th century leading to the construction of a Visigoth monastery. Between 776 and 799, Leidrad of Lyon, the bishop of La Seu d'Urgell, brought the monastery into the Benedictine Order. The monastery prospered in the 10th and 11th centuries leading to a new building which was consecrated to the Virgin Mary, St Michael and St Saturnin in 1040 by Bishop Eriball of Urgell and Bishop Arnulf of Ribagor√ßa. In the 11th century, the monastery was so rich and powerful that it was able to provide assistance to the Counts of Urgell. During this period the monastery's possessions extended from El Bergued√† to Andorra and included the County of Pallars and Cerdanya. Bulls issued by Pope Urban II in 1099 and by Pope Callixtus II in 1119 documented the monastery's privileges and exemptions. The monastery began to decline in the 14th century, leading to its suppression by Pope Clement VIII in 1592 when it received the modest status of Parish of Anserall. Soon abandoned, it fell into ruin. The capitals from the cloister were later transferred to the Maricel Museum in Sitges from where some were sold to American buyers. The church remained a ruin until 1971 when restoration work was initiated. Church Remains of the nave The monastery church was constructed as a T-shaped basilica with its nave and adjoining aisles separated by pillars. All that remains of the original building is the western end which unusually has an apse. The only example of its kind in Catalonia, it is in line with the Carolingian tradition. The main apse opens into three smaller apses, symbolizing the Trinity. The remains of the transept can still be seen but there are only a few small vestiges of the nave and the aisles. The nave was covered with barrel vaulting while the lateral aisles had quarter-circular vaults. There are still traces of the base of the primitive steeple but nothing is left of the cloister which was akin to that in the Cathedral of Santa Maria d'Urgell. The church's baldaquin and 12th century altarpiece depicting bishops with halos are preserved in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.

First designated SS Badger Mariner, she was originally built as a freighter in 1953. However, her career as a cargo vessel was relatively short. In 1958, she was rebuilt as a passenger liner. Renamed SS Atlantic, this ship became familiar to many American tourists during the 1960s, making cruises to the Caribbean and Mediterranean. In 1971, she was retired from commercial service and purchased by C. Y. Tung, a Chinese shipping magnate, and converted to a university at sea, first as the SS Universe Campus, then as the SS Universe. Freighter SS Badger Mariner was built as a 9,214 gross ton cargo ship. Construction occurred in 1952 and 1953 at Sun Ship Building & Dry Dock Co., in Chester, Pennsylvania. She was launched on July 1, 1953. SS Badger Mariner was one of approximately 35 cargo ships of the C4-S-1a class designed and built to provide fast support for the US military, following the retirement of World War II liberty ships. She had a central-island superstructure, with three large deck cranes located forward and two large deck cranes located aft. These cranes serviced four forward hatches and two aft hatches, all of which were hydraulically operated. She had a length of 564 feet, a beam of 76 feet, and a draft of 26 feet, and could achieve a maximum speed of 20 knots. Her cargo capacity was 769,949 cubic feet, all of which was contained in below-deck holds. In 1958 she was sold to the American Banner Lines. Cruise ship Upon acquiring the SS Badger Mariner in 1958, the American Banner Lines undertook an extensive conversion, turning the ship into a medium-sized passenger liner. This work took place at the Ingalls Ship Building Corporation at Pascagoula, Mississippi. Following this conversion, the linear dimensions of the ship remained the same. However, with the addition of passenger decks, her gross tonnage increased to 14,138. She was renamed SS Atlantic. The conversion successfully masked the ship‚Äôs origins as a freighter, and gave her a modern, well-proportioned, though slightly-boxy profile. Overall, her appearance was in keeping with other passenger vessels designed and built in the late 1950s and early 1960s. She sported a black hull with a white strip at the base of the superstructure, the lower deck of which retained the black coloration of the hull. Her upper superstructure was white and was topped by a squat blue funnel. She featured glass-enclosed promenades, running most of the length of both sides of the promenade deck, and spacious public rooms. On June 11, 1958, SS Atlantic departed on her maiden voyage. While under the American Banner Lines flag, she ran between New York, Antwerp, and Amsterdam. This service did not return the expected profit, and the vessel was again placed on the market in 1959. SS Atlantic was soon acquired by the American Export Lines. An extensive refit, completed in May, 1960, boosted her size to 18,100 gross tons. She was turned into a warm-weather cruise ship, catering primarily to tourist class passengers. She was equipped with a large outdoor pool and was given an all white hull and superstructure. Her funnel, in keeping with the American Export Lines livery, was marked by black, white, and buff stripes. She could accommodate 880 passengers, 40 housed in first class accommodations. The vessel was fully air conditioned and each passenger cabin was equipped with a private bathroom. She was fitted with stabilizers in 1961. SS Atlantic had six passenger decks, with the uppermost designated as the Bridge Deck, and those below as the Boat Deck, Promenade Deck, Upper Deck, Main Deck, and ‚ÄúA‚Äù Deck, respectively. Between 1960 and 1967, SS Atlantic ran successful cruises between New York, Florida, and the Caribbean, stopping at St. Thomas, Jamaica and other destinations. Her voyages were advertised as Beachcomber Cruises to the Caribbean. She also made 24-day cruises to the Mediterranean. In January 1967, the SS Atlantic ran aground on a sand bar when leaving Port Everglades, Fort Lauderdale, Florida on a seven-day Caribbean cruise. Tugs required two days to dislodge the ship, which returned to Port Everglades without significant damage. Later in 1967, the vessel was withdrawn from service due to declines in passenger traffic. University at Sea In 1971, the vessel was purchased by C. Y. Tung, was registered to Seawise Foundation, Inc., and was designated SS Universe Campus. From this point forward, she had a very successful career traveling the globe as a university at sea. The vessel housed about 500 students and 60 faculty members for four-month semesters. In 1976, SS Universe Campus was renamed SS Universe. By 1989, she had carried more than 20,000 students. Disposition As a result of aging boilers, delayed sailings, and mounting repair bills, SS Universe was retired in 1995. She was towed to Alang, India, where she was scrapped in 1996.

Maolra Seoighe, Cappancreha, County Galway, was a man who was wrongfully convicted and hanged on 15 December 1882. He was found guilty of the Maamtrasna Murders and was sentenced to death. The case was heard in the English language, though he understood only Irish. He was pardoned in 2018. Maamtrasna murders Maolra Seoighe was the most prominent figure in a controversial trial in 1882 that took place while Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. Three Irish language speakers were condemned to death for the murder of a local family (John Joyce, his wife Brighid, his mother Mair√©ad, his daughter Peig√≠ and son Miche√°l) in Maamtrasna, on the border between County Mayo and County Galway. It was presumed by the authorities to be a local feud connected to sheep rustling and the Land War. Eight men were convicted on what turned out to be perjured evidence and three of them condemned to death: Myles Joyce (a father of five children), Pat Casey and Pat Joyce. Covering the incident, London-based magazine The Spectator wrote the following: > The Tragedy at Maamtrasna, investigated this week in Dublin, almost unique > as it is in the annals of the United Kingdom, brings out in strong relief > two facts which Englishmen are too apt to forget. One is the existence in > particular districts of Ireland of a class of peasants who are scarcely > civilised beings, and approach far nearer to savages than any other white > men; and the other is their extraordinary and exceptional gloominess of > temper. In remote places of Ireland, especially in Connaught, on a few of > the islands, and in one or two mountain districts, dwell cultivators who are > in knowledge, in habits, and in the discipline of life no higher than > Maories or other Polynesians. The court proceedings were carried out in a language they did not understand (English), with a solicitor from Trinity College, Dublin, who did not speak Irish. The three were executed in Galway by William Marwood for the crime in 1882. The role of John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, who was then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, is the most controversial aspect of the trial, leading most modern scholars to count it as a miscarriage of justice; research carried out in the British archives by Se√°n √ì Cuirre√°in, has found that Spencer \\"compensated\\" three alleged eyewitnesses to the sum of ¬£1,250, equivalent to ‚Ç¨157,000 (by 2016 rates). To date, the Spencer family and the British government have issued no apology or pardon for the executions, though the case has been periodically taken up by various political figures. The then MP for Westmeath, Timothy Harrington, took up the case, claiming that the Crown Prosecutor for the case George Bolton, had deliberately withheld evidence from the trial. In 2011, the two sitting members of the British House of Lords, David Alton and Eric Lubbock from the Liberal Democrats, requested a review of the case. Crispin Blunt, Tory Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Prisons and Youth Justice, stated that Joyce was \\"probably an innocent man\\", but that he would not be seeking an official pardon. On 4 April 2018 Michael D. Higgins, the President of Ireland, issued a pardon on the advice of the current government of Ireland saying ‚ÄúMaolra Seoighe was wrongly convicted of murder and was hanged for a crime that he did not commit.‚Äù It is the first presidential pardon relating to an event predating the foundation of the state in 1922 and the second time a pardon has been issued after an execution. The case of Myles Joyce is not an isolated one, and there are strong similarities with the case of Patrick Walsh who was hanged in Galway jail on 22 September 1882 just three months before Maolra for the murders of Martin and John Lydon. The same key players and political factors were active in both cases and his conviction is just as questionable as that of Myles Media In September 2009, the story featured on RT√â's CSI programme under an episode entitled CSI Maamtrasna Massacre. A dramatised Irish-language film regarding the affair, entitled Murdair Mh√°m Trasna, produced by Ciar√°n √ì Cofaigh was released in 2017.

The novel, said to have been started in 1894, was to be about a male prostitute. No trace of the manuscript has ever been found.Berryman, p. 86 Genesis The genesis of the novel is reported in a document found among the papers of Crane biographer Thomas Beer. The document is an unsigned letter that Crane biographer John Berryman attributed to James Huneker, an older acquaintance of Crane's. The letter reads: > One night in April or May of 1894, I ran into Crane on Broadway and we > started over to the Everett House together, I'd been at a theater with > Saltus and was in evening dress. In the Square a kid came up and begged from > us. I was drunk enough to give him a quarter. He followed along and I saw he > was really soliciting. Crane was damned innocent about everything but women > and didn't see what the boy's game was. We got to the Everett House and we > could see that the kid was painted. He was very handsome‚Äîlooked like a > Rossetti angel‚Äîbig violet eyes‚Äîprobably full of belladonna. He took the kid > in and fed him supper. Got him to talk. The kid had syphilis, of course‚Äîmost > of that type do‚Äîand wanted money to have himself treated. Crane rang up > Irving Bacheller and borrowed fifty dollars. > > He pumped a mass of details out of the boy whose name was something like > Coolan and began a novel about a boy prostitute. I made him read √Ä Rebours > which he didn't like very much. Thought it stilted. This novel began with a > scene in a railroad station. Probably the best passage of prose that Crane > ever wrote. Boy from the country running off to see New York. He read the > thing to Garland who was horrified and begged him to stop. I don't know that > he ever finished the book. He was going to call it Flowers of Asphalt.Quoted > in Delany, pp. 193‚Äî94 Questions Whether Crane actually began Flowers of Asphalt remains an open question. Acknowledging that its attestation is not the greatest, Berryman noted that the projected theme was in line with the themes of other Crane works, including Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, George's Mother and to a lesser degree The Red Badge of Courage: \\"the movement in youth from innocence to experience, seen as degradation.\\" He further cited a letter that Crane sent to Hamlin Garland in June 1894 in which Crane reported he was working on a new novel, a letter Huneker could not have known about. The relationship between Garland and Crane deteriorated and Berryman suggested that it could have been as a consequence of how disturbing Garland found the excerpt of Flowers of Asphalt Crane supposedly read to him and Crane's resentment at following Garland's advice to abandon it. Finally, the purported title, the report of Crane's opinion of √Ä rebours and the railway station setting led him to conclude that the account was genuine.Berryman, pp. 86‚Äî8 Writer and critic Samuel R. Delany cast doubt on the veracity of the Huneker letter, noting that it is unsigned and not written in Huneker's usual style, lacking any salutation. Delany allowed for the possibility that Huneker simply wrote the letter quickly or that Beer reconstructed the information from a recollection of an earlier discussion with Huneker. However, Beer's known propensity for fabricating information about Crane makes accepting the passage as factual problematic. Delany speculated that Beer, who was gay, might have created the letter as a way of introducing the idea that Crane was gay or bisexual.Delany, pp. 194‚Äî95 Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim found the account improbable. Crane was impoverished in 1894 and had not yet met Bacheller, making it unlikely that Crane could have borrowed as large a sum as $50 to give to a stranger. He noted that Huneker told writer Vincent Starrett that Crane had started a book called Flowers in Asphalt in October 1898, but at that time Crane was in Havana and was \\"no longer innocent about New York street life\\".Wertheim, p. 110 Influence Avant-garde filmmaker Gregory Markopoulos took the title of his 1951 film Flowers of Asphalt from the Crane novel.Flowers of Asphalt (1951) References Notes Bibliography * Berryman, John (1950, rev. ed. 2001).

Surgical missions provide help to children who would otherwise not have access to this care in their own country. The missions' priorities are to provide local surgeons and medical staff with mentoring and specialized surgical training in order to create self-sustainment. In 2014, MendingKids is scheduled to travel on 11 missions including: Ethiopia, Panama,Guatemala (2 trips), Mozambique, China, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama and Nicaragua. :3)International Surgeries ‚Äì‚Äì Due to a variety of reasons, including funding, it may be near impossible to fly the child to Los Angeles or send a surgical mission team to serve one patient. To solve this type of cases, MendingKids arranges to fund or provide surgeries to these children locally or in neighboring countries by partnering with local hospitals and other NGOs who may have access to surgeons but not the necessary funding. :4) Hometown Mission Mending Kids launched their first Hometown mission in July 2013. The program gives needed operations to children living in the United States treatment when they do not have access to the surgical care they need, or have been denied by providers. A volunteer surgical team from a local hospital perform operations on up to 20 children on one day over the summer.

Degree in botany from the Depauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. She went on to earn her M.S. and her P.h.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1933 and 1935 respectively. During her graduate career, she specialized in plant cytology and agricultural bacteriology under the supervision of Charles E. Allen and W.D. Frost. A fellow student, Robert E. Duncan was also studying in Allen‚Äôs lab. She was married to Robert E. Duncan and had a daughter, Dana Duncan. Both she and Robert worked at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Shortly after graduating, her first position was as an assistant professor at Hood College, where she served until 1942. In December 1942, she joined the Forest Products Laboratory (a division of the United States Forest Service) at Madison, Wisconsin in cooperation with the University of Wisconsin. Originally, she was recruited by the Laboratory to aid in the war effort. However, after the war, she stayed on for the remainder of her career. She eventually rose to the rank of principal pathologist at the lab in the Wood Fungi and Insects Research, where she served until her death in 1968. She was very dedicated to her work, often working on the weekends and extended hours. She is also mentioned to have an innate curiosity of all facets of biology. She also had the ability to be easy-going, yet also exacting in her own work. Career During her career, she published over 40 papers examining various aspects of wood decay fungi, including (but not limited to): sunlight and the effect on respiration, effect of preservatives, and moisture. She also regularly published new findings in regards to species found on decaying wood. A majority of her work surrounded the quality and improvement of wood preservatives. Several articles alluded to the notion that fungi could overcome some rather toxic compounds, such as arsenic. Duncan studied the decay of wood as it pertains to fungal degradation. In her early work, she was responsible for assessing the natural decay of wood from many species. One technique that she was involved in developing was the soil-block technique. Based on articles written, she worked on Basidiomycota and Ascomycota in regards to their role in wood decay. A majority of her work was identifying Ascomycetes associated with wood decay. She examined the capacity of these fungi to attack various types of wood treatments, both synthetic and naturally occurring. Shortly after graduating with her Ph.D., Duncan taught botany and bacteriology at Hood College in Maryland. She continued to study under her major advisor, Allen during the summertime. During this period, she studied the various stages of meiosis that Sphaerocarpos spp. undergoes during its life cycle. In 1942, both Catherine and Robert Duncan accepted positions at the University of Wisconsin. Early in her career, one of the first projects she completed in the forest products laboratory was to examine the natural resistance of decay from different species of trees. In order to study these differences, she also helped develop a technique known as the soil-block technique, which allows for wood decay to be studied at an accelerated rate. This technique became especially important when evaluating wood preservatives and their longevity. This technique is still used today. Basic laboratory techniques for studying wood decay were severely lacking in 1942. These basic laboratory techniques would be used in her later work in addition to being adopted by other agencies, such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). In building on techniques developed in her early work, Duncan became focused on individual components extracted from wood and their relationship to wood decay. This work was particularly relevant to ‚Äúsoft rot‚Äù fungi and the effect the aforementioned fungi had on the invasion of different hosts. Her focus was to add longevity to wood species that were found to be less resistant to microbial decay. Her work on soft rot fungi also led her to identifying and describing the fungi from a physiological standpoint. During her later career, she discovered a novel relationship between sunlight and respiration of Basidiomycetes. Additionally, she also worked with Ascomycetes and their ability to cause soft-rot symptoms on wood. In 1963, Duncan was recognized for her ability to conduct fundamental research and this led to an 18-month appointment abroad working with Frey-Wyssling, a renowned Swiss fungal physiologist. During her appointment, she developed a new technique known as immunofluorescence. This technique proved to be helpful in studying the synthesis and mobilization of cellulase in the hyphae into the host substrate. Duncan also investigated the growth and movement of soft-rot fungi into the wood substrate, made possible by the use of a fluorescent staining technique. During her tenure at the Forest Products Laboratory, she was involved with the dissertations of 30 students. Students noted that \\"It was always a challenge to meet her standards for rigor and proof in research\\". In 1963, Duncan was recognized for her work with two postdoctoral fellowships. The first was awarded by the Forest Products Laboratory. The other was awarded by the National Science Foundation. Duncan also was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Phytopathological Society (APS), and the Botanical Society of America. Both her experience in cytology and her ability to culture diverse wood-inhabiting fungi led to many advances in the fundamental studies in fungal physiology and the interactions observed with plant cell walls. During her career, she published nearly 40 major contributions to the field.

He was named a National Radio Hall of Fame Regional Pioneer by the Illinois Broadcasters Association.  Early Days  Mal was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming in 1919, the only son of Keith Bellairs and Gertrude Sackett of Telluride, Colorado. In his teen years he was raised on the ranch of his uncle Thorwald Sackett in Colorado. He recounted being enthralled by the wonder of radio on a visit to Denver as a boy. He also recounts a family trip to Chicago to attend the worlds fair in 1933.  Radio History  Mal's career in radio began at WCFL (AM) in Chicago in 1947. He left WCFL to do freelance radio and television in the Chicago market. Mal then spent most of the 1950s and 1960s at WBBM (AM) radio in Chicago Illinois. His history with WBBM is recounted in an oral history interview from 1987. Mal's contributions to WBBM were highlighted in a subsequent history of that radio station, WBBM Radio Yesterday & Today. In 1969 Mal and his wife Jo purchased WCLR radio in Crystal Lake, Illinois and changed the call letters to WIVS.Ghrist, John R. Valley Voices: A Radio History. Crossroads Communications, May 1, 1996. They later purchased an FM station in Woodstock, Illinois and used the call letters WXRD. Subsequently, WIVS became WAIT (AM). The Chicago Tribune reported on Mal's \\"semi-retirement\\" in 1992. The article quotes Chuck Schaden, Chicago radio history buff and host of \`\`Golden Age of Radio\`\` programs on WBBM-AM and WNIB- FM 97.1 saying \\"Mal Bellairs was, and still is, as far as I\`m concerned, a giant in Chicago broadcasting.\\"  The Christmas Show  In 1955 Mal presented a Christmas Show that became a Chicago tradition. He did a Christmas Show every year after that, continuing at WBBM (AM) and then at his own station, WIVS. The recording of the Christmas Show that is available online was made from a live broadcast in 1997. A copy of the clearances for the playlist of the 1961 Christmas Show is in the National Archives.

A party of 3000 Polish insurgents commanded by Marian Langiewicz, clashed with units of the Imperial Russian Army. The Poles managed to defeat the enemy, with heavy losses on both sides. After the victorious Battle of Skala, Polish insurgents, who had tried to cross the border with nearby Austrian Galicia, turned northwards and headed towards Miechow. When Poles were camping in Chroberz, they found out about a Russian unit, which marched towards them from Pinczow, along the Nida river valley. Polish commandant (naczelnik) Marian Langiewicz ordered Francois Rochebrune and his Zouaves of Death to cover the march of the main group of Polish forces. When another Russian unit appeared on the left bank of the Nida, Langiewicz sent there infantry under Colonel Dionizy Czachowski. Meanwhile, Rochebrune burned a bridge over the Nida, and joined Langiewicz. All Polish forces began to retreat, protected by Czachowski's infantry.

Early life and education He was born in Guelph, Ontario and raised in Acton, to a family of the political diaspora that left Slovenia in 1945. Taken by his father to his first accordion lesson at age five, he studied with local teachers until 1968, when he enrolled at Toronto's Royal Conservatory of Music. In 1975 he completed his Bachelor of Music at Queen's University, Kingston. That same year, he moved to Toronto and completed his master's degree in Musicology in 1977. Influenced by the Toronto visit of Swiss accordionist Hugo Noth in 1975, Petric studied at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Trossingen in 1977. Musical career In October 1979, Petric made his Canadian debut with Toronto's Arraymusic Ensemble, and became the first accordionist to win the CBC National Radio Auditions, which launched his career on both the English and French radio services of Canada. He started his international career in Washington, D.C. at the Kennedy Centre in 1986 and in London at St John's, Smith Square in 1992. Throughout the 1980s, his artistic activity included commissioning, performing and recording, with invitations from Serge Garant and Montreal's SMCQ ensemble, ACREQ, the string quartets Alcan and St. Germain, the NEM Ensemble, and Penta√®dre; he received invitations to the McGill, Domaine Forget, and Bic St. Fabien festivals. He was the artistic director of The Big Squeeze accordion festival in Toronto in 1991, as well as the Virtuosi Series for the CBC at the Glenn Gould Hall in 1993. In 1998, he turned his attention to the research of period performance practices and instrument building, with the assistance of a Canada Council Senior Artist's Grant, working with period keyboard artists Colin Tilney and Boyd McDonald In 2000, he became the artistic director for the Carte Blanche Series in Montreal for the Soci√©t√© Radio Canada, and Quebec City in 2003. His postmodern approaches attracted the marketing support of four international management companies: MGAM in Toronto, NCCP in London, Sarah Turner Communications in Paris, and Columbia Artists in New York City; as well as financial support of the Koussevitsky Foundation, CBC, and the Canada Council for the Arts. He enjoyed special relationships with Bob Aitken's New Music Concerts in Toronto, the Societe Contemporaine de Quebec in Montreal, the Canadian Electronic Ensemble, and composer Witold Lutoslawski. A steady stream of international tours followed, with up to 80 concerts a year, and international recordings for CBC, SRC, BBC Radio 3, and PBS (USA). His numerous collaborations include: the Petric-Forget Duo, Penta√®dre, Canada‚Äôs Penderecki Quartet, Duo Contempera, the Trio Diomira, Pauline Oliveros, and the ensembles Erosonic and Bellows and Brass.

High school career Etling quarterbacked the Terre Haute South Vigo High School football team in Terre Haute, Indiana. He was poised for a big senior season after a disappointing junior year where the Braves started 3‚Äì0 before losing their final seven games. For his senior year, Etling threw for 1,505 yards and 11 touchdowns. He is an Eagle Scout.New England Patriots Telecast, Boston Channel 4, August 16, 2018. As a junior, Etling committed to Purdue University on April 17, 2012. He also received football scholarship offers from Colorado and Iowa. When Purdue head coach Danny Hope was fired, Etling stayed verbally committed to Purdue. Once Darrell Hazell was hired, Etling wanted to take the time to speak with Hazell before making a final decision on Purdue. Upon the completion of the first semester of his senior year of high school, Etling fulfilled his graduation requirements and decided to enroll at Purdue for the spring semester. College career Purdue In the preseason of 2013, Etling was in a three-way quarterback battle with Rob Henry and Austin Appleby. When Henry was named the starter for the season, Purdue released its depth chart with Appleby listed as the number two quarterback. This led many to believe that Etling would utilize a redshirt. After the Boilermakers started their 2013 season with an 0‚Äì3 record, and with Henry continuing to struggle in the team's fourth game, Etling was thrust into a game with Purdue trailing 27‚Äì10 to Northern Illinois. Etling finished the game with 241 yards passing while throwing two touchdowns and two interceptions. During the ensuing week, Etling was named the starter for the Boilermakers against Nebraska. Purdue struggled in Etling's first start, losing 44‚Äì7. Overall, Etling appeared in eight games, passing for 1690 yards, ten touchdowns, and seven interceptions, with a 116.1 quarterback rating. The team finished with a 1‚Äì11 record. Going into the 2014 season, Etling was named the starter. However, during the season Etling was moved second on the depth chart, behind Appleby. Etling appeared in five games, passing for 800 yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions, and a 102.5 quarterback rating. Purdue's record for the season was 3‚Äì9. On June 11, 2015, Etling asked for and was granted a release on his scholarship from Purdue. LSU On June 22, 2015, it was announced that Etling would transfer to Louisiana State University (LSU). Due to NCAA transfer rules, Etling sat out the 2015 season. He served as the starting quarterback for the LSU Tigers during their 2016 and 2017 seasons, playing a total of 24 games. In 2016, the Tigers were 7‚Äì4 during the regular season and defeated the Louisville Cardinals in the 2016 Citrus Bowl played on December 31. In 2017, the Tigers had a 9‚Äì3 regular season record, and lost to Notre Dame in the 2018 Citrus Bowl played on January 1.

After Marian Langiewicz had fled to Austrian Galicia, remnants of his unit were commanded by General Jozef Smiechowski and Jozef Miniewski. To avoid encirclement, Polish insurgents abandoned their camp in Welecz, and marched to Opatowiec, via Wislica. The insurgents, who planned to cross the Austrian border, were chased by troops of the Imperial Russian Army, who harassed and attacked them. Polish rear was protected by two infantry battalions under Captain Stanislaw Wierzbinski. Near Czernichow and Igolomia, some 800 Poles escaped to Galicia, while a smaller unit of insurgents was surrounded by the Russians in Igolomia.

Recreational caving has occurred there since the 1960s. Fossils found (starting in 2013) in the cave were, in 2015, proposed to represent a previously unknown extinct species of hominin named Homo naledi. Names In the 1980s, the names \\"Empire\\", \\"Westminster\\", and \\"Rising Star\\" were used interchangeably. The species name, naledi (seSotho for \\"star\\"), and the \\"Dinaledi Chamber\\" (incorporating the Sotho word for \\"stars\\")Sesotho dinaledi is a class 10 plural noun built on the class 9 noun naledi \\"star\\" (Bukantswe v.3 dictionary). were so named by members of the Rising Star Expedition in reference to the species and chamber's location in Rising Star Cave. A portion of the cave, used by the excavation team en route to the Dinaledi Chamber, is called \\"Superman's Crawl\\" because most people can fit through only by holding one arm tightly against the body and extending the other above the head, in the manner of Superman in flight. The Superman Crawl opens into the \\"Dragon's Back Chamber,\\" which includes an approximately 15 m (49 foot) exposed climb up a ridge of a sharp-edged dolomite block that fell from the roof sometime in the distant past. This block is the so-called Dragon's Back, so named because the climbing route appears to progress from the tail to the head along the spiked spine of a mythical beast. History Geologists think the cave in which the fossils were discovered is no older than three million years. The cave was explored in the 1980s by the Speleological Exploration Club (SEC), a local branch of the South African Speleological Association (SASA). Discovery of fossils in \\"Dinaledi Chamber\\" On 13 September 2013, while exploring the Rising Star cave system, recreational cavers Rick Hunter and Steven Tucker of the Speleological Exploration Club (SEC) found a narrow, vertically oriented \\"chimney\\" or \\"chute\\" measuring long with an average width of . Then Hunter discovered a room underground (Site U.W. 101, the Dinaledi Chamber), the surface of which was littered with fossil bones. On 1 October, photos of the site were shown to Pedro Boshoff and then to Lee Berger, both of the University of the Witwatersrand. The arrangement of bones, as well as several survey pegs, suggested \\"someone had already been there\\" as recently as a few decades earlier. The appearance of limited fossilisation initially led the explorers to think the bones were from the last caver into the chamber, who had subsequently never made it back out alive. 2013 and 2014 excavations Berger organized an expedition to excavate the fossils, which started on 7 November 2013. The expedition was funded by the South African National Research Foundation and the National Geographic Society. The excavation team enlisted six paleoanthropologists, all of whom were women, who could pass through an opening only 18 cm (7 inches) wide to access the Dinaledi Chamber. Those chosen were Hannah Morris, Marina Elliott, Becca Peixotto, Alia Gurtov, Lindsay Eaves, and Elen Feuerriegel. They have since been nicknamed the Underground Astronauts. The Dinaledi Chamber was assigned the designation UW-101 and was excavated by these six members of the Rising Star Expedition during November 2013. More than 1,200 fossil elements were recovered and catalogued in November 2013, representing at least a dozen individuals. Only 20 out of 206 bones in the human body were not found in the cave as of Summer 2014. By April 2014, between two localities, 1,754 specimens were recovered. The layered distribution of the bones [in clay-rich sediments] suggests that they had been deposited over a long period of time, perhaps centuries. Only one square meter of the cave chamber has been excavated; other remains might still be there. On 20 February 2014, Rick Hunter, Lee Berger, John Hawks, Alia Gurtov, and Pedro Boshoff returned to Rising Star to evaluate a second potential site. The site, designated UW-102, was found by cavers Rick Hunter and Steve Tucker on the last day of the first Rising Star Expedition, and limited excavation began in April 2014. , fossils of at least fifteen individuals, amounting to 1,550 specimens, had been excavated from the cave. About 300 bone fragments were collected from the surface of the Dinaledi Chamber, and about 1,250 fossil specimens were recovered from the chamber's main excavation pit, Unit 3. The fossils include skulls, jaws, ribs, teeth, bones of an almost complete foot, of a hand, and of an inner ear. The bones of both old and young individuals, as well as infants, were found. The 15 partial skeletons, which were found in a small underground chamber, invite speculation on the circumstances of their location. Paleoanthropologist John D. Hawks, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is a member of the team, has stated that the scientific facts are that all the bones recovered are hominin, except for those of one owl; there are no signs of predation, and there is no predator that accumulates only hominins this way; the bones did not accumulate there all at once. There is no evidence of rocks or sediment having dropped into the cave from any opening in the surface; no evidence of water flowing into the cave carrying the bones into the cave. Hawks concluded that the best hypothesis is that the bodies were deliberately placed in the cave after death, by other members of the species. Berger et al. suggest that \\"these individuals were capable of ritual behaviour.\\" They speculate the placing of dead bodies in the cave was a ritualistic behaviour, a sign of symbolic thought. \\"Ritual\\" here means an intentional and repeated practice (disposing of dead bodies in the cave), and not implying any type of religious ritual. This hypothesis has been criticised for its improbability. A study involving the statistical reconstruction of hominin evolutionary trees from skull and tooth measurements, indicates that the most likely age for H. naledi is 912 kya. The Tswaing crater, some 220,000 ¬± 52,000 years old, lies only 70 km distant. A collaborative workshop involving 54 local and international scientists took place in May 2014 at the University of the Witwatersrand, On 10 September 2015, the fossils were publicly unveiled and given the name Homo naledi. Dating The fossils of the Dinaledi chamber have been dated to between 335,000 and 236,000 years ago, long after much larger-brained and more modern-looking hominins had appeared. Geologists estimate that the cave in which the fossils were discovered is no older than three million years, and the ages for flowstone where the fossils were recovered from was interpreted to be deposited between 236,000 and 414,000 years ago. Geology The Rising Star cave system lies in the Bloubank River valley, 2.2 km west of Sterkfontein Cave. It comprises an area of 250 √ó 150 m of mapped passageways situated in the core of a gently west dipping (17¬∞) open fold, and it is stratigraphically bound to a 15‚Äì20 m-thick, stromatolitic dolomite horizon in the lower parts of the Monte Christo Formation. This dolomite horizon is largely chert-free but contains five thin (<10 cm) chert marker horizons that have been used to evaluate the relative position of chambers within the system. The upper contact is marked by a 1‚Äì1.3 m-thick, capping chert unit that forms the roof of several large cave chambers. The altitude above sea level is 1,450 m for the Dinaledi Chamber's floor.

The SOHL was established in 1985. The SOHL is governed by a Board of Directors and employs two permanent full-time staff members. Its membership consists of over 70 heritage language schools and multilingual organizations. Regular membership is open to any community-based non-profit organization in Saskatchewan involved in developing, teaching, and promoting the learning of heritage languages. Associate membership is open to individuals and institutions supportive of the aims and objectives of SOHL but not eligible for regular membership. Associate members cannot vote or hold office. History SOHL had its formal beginning on June 1, 1985, and was designated a non-profit PCO in August 1987. In 1994, SOHL hosted a national conference entitled ‚ÄúSpeak Up, Speak Out!‚Äù It focused on the job and economic opportunities created by languages and on the importance of languages in the international marketplace. In 1996/97, SOHL introduced a new project - the Mini-Language Lessons Program, into the public and separate school systems. Heritage language teachers introduced students to the culture and language of various countries in the world. A Future Search Conference was held in 1999. The purpose was to look at past accomplishments and achievements of SOHL, to look at its current state and to begin the process of creating a new vision for the future. In 2004, SOHL celebrated Heritage Languages Recognition Day with a Choral Festival. Due to the positive response, celebrations are now held annually in both Regina and Saskatoon to mark this occasion. In 2005, SOHL celebrated its 20th Anniversary. Along with a special celebration at our conference, SOHL produced a Centennial History Book looking back at years of Heritage Language Schools in Saskatchewan. In 2008, SOHL celebrated UNESCO's declaration of 2008 as the International Year of Languages.

He served in World War I working on various staffs. Between the wars he held various posts at the head of infantry units or in the Ministry of War, where he was chief of √âdouard Daladier's military cabinet three times between February 1932 and July 1937. Assessed by the British as a \\"political general ... of little of no worth,\\" he was alleged to have formed a screen which restricted contact between the minister and the military officers under his command. During this period he was promoted Brigadier-General in 1932, Major-General in 1935, Lieutenant-General in 1936 and General in 1939. On the outbreak of World War II, Bourret was given command of the Fifth Army, stationed in Alsace. Subordinates who had been critics of Bourret during his time at the ministry grew to admire him as a commander. Amongst the officers under his command was Colonel Charles de Gaulle, who was in command of the army's five scattered battalions of tanks. During the battle of France, on 17 June 1940, he was replaced as commander of 5th Army by Charles-Marie Cond√© and placed in command of the reserves. As the army retreated, he went to Fort de Girancourt, part of the outdated S√©r√© de Rivi√®res fortifications He was taken prisoner on 25 June 1940 at G√©rardmer and spent five years in captivity in the K√∂nigstein Fortress in Saxony.

It won the Rh√∂n competition in 1931 and made several outstanding flights as well as setting a fashion for gull wings. Design and development Lippisch began the design of the influential Fafnir in 1929. Its refined design proved difficult to construct and the aircraft was only just ready for flight tests at the start of the 1930 Rh√∂n competition on the Wasserkuppe. The Fafnir was not the first glider with a cantilever wing, for the Darmstadt Konsul had been built seven years earlier but a cantilever wing with an aspect ratio of almost 20 was exceptional. The single wing spar had to be deep for strength and Lippisch accommodated this by using the G√∂ttingen 652 airfoil which is thick and strongly cambered, additionally providing lift at low speeds. The wing root was faired into the upper fuselage. The wing was straight tapered in plan to elliptical tips and the profile changed along the span through the less cambered, more widely used G√∂ttingen 535 to the familiar Clarke Y profile with washout at the tips to prevent tip stalling. It was plywood covered ahead of the spar, with fabric covering aft. Laterally stabilising dihedral was not common on gliders in 1929 but Lippisch applied it to about 40% of the inner span on the Fafnir, producing a gull wing. Many later gliders followed this form, though it is harder to build and has no solid aerodynamic justification. The trailing edges of the outer part of the wing carried broad and constant chord ailerons. The Fafnir's fuselage was oval in cross section, carefully streamlined with a ply skin and becoming slender behind the wing. The cockpit was just ahead of the wing and originally enclosed in a ply covered faring with only two side apertures for vision. Later this fairing was replaced with a stepped and fully glazed canopy. All the tail surfaces were fabric covered: an all-moving tapered elevator with an unswept leading edge was mounted on the fuselage mid-line below a small, straight edged fin which carried a large, rounded rudder mounted at the keel and moving in a shallow elevator cut-out. Launching accidents showed this exposed low mounting to be a dangerous weakness. A skid, running from the nose to under the wing trailing edge acted as an undercarriage. Operational history The Fafnir had only just begun test flights at the start of the Rh√∂n competition held in August 1930, when wing root turbulence was found to reduce performance. After this was rapidly reduced by the addition of shaped balsa blocks at the cockpit-leading edge junction the glider, piloted by G√ºnther Groenhoff, had some success, sharing a new record out and return flight of with Robert Kronfeld. Despite several launching accidents in the Alps early in the new year, 1931 was a successful period for Groenhoff and the Fafnir. He made the first glider flight of over , flying from Munich to Kaaden in May after a tow launch. Because of the tow launch this was not officially recognised but a bungee launched, flight, made between the Wasserkuppe and Magdeburg in late August did set a new record. Groenhoff was overall winner at the 1931 Rh√∂n competition. He was killed in the Fafnir at the 1932 Rh√∂n in another rudder related launching accident. Repaired and with a lengthened and glazed cockpit, the Fafnir was flown on some notable flights in 1933, including one of over from Darmstadt to France and others above Berlin. In 1934 it was taken to South America and flown for over seven hours over Buenos Aires. On return it continued to fly from its Darmstadt home until retired to a Berlin museum, where it was destroyed by bombing in World War II.

The games aesthetics are largely inspired by Manga, particularly the work of Masamune Shirow. Each player controls a set of miniatures to represent soldiers on a tabletop battlefield, taking actions during play to achieve their set goals and prevent their opponent from achieving theirs, while also seeking to destroy their opponents soldiers. Unlike many tabletop games, the rules for Infinity are freely available for download and supported by an official wiki.  Setting  The game is set 175 years in the future, as such the aesthetics of Infinity can vary from run down shanty towns to hyper futuristic and pristine city precincts. The Human race have discovered worm holes that allow interstellar travel into new galaxies; the nations of earth formed alliances with each other in order to join the space race to use these wormholes to colonize far-off planets. It is these alliances along with newly discovered alien races that are competing for resources and technology that cause the friction and conflict that plays out on the table when playing Infinity the Game.  Gameplay  This game uses unit and weapon profiles to determine the capabilities of each miniature on the tabletop, these profiles are then used alongside tape measures and twenty-sided dice to determine the outcomes of many of the actions and situations that arise during a game. The Infinity game system uses a pool of orders which are used for individual model actions on the active players turn; these can be spent on a single model or spread across many. A turn in infinity consists of the active player (the player whose turn it is) and reactive player (the player whose turn it isn't), the reactive player game mechanic allows the reactive player to make tactical decisions and actions based on their opponent's actions, though these will be in a more limited capacity to the active player. This feature allows both players to participate in every part of the game. Face to face rolls are used during gameplay to signify that two or more models are directly affecting each other with their actions, the player who rolls more successful wins the encounter. Dice roll modifiers for weapon ranges exist that make targets easier to hit at a weapons optimum range and worse at close or longer ranges. Hackers are also featured in Infinity and they allow players to immobilize, control or otherwise hamper of their adversaries robotic and power armored units. Unlike most competitive tabletop miniature wargames, there are several things that a player keeps hidden from their opponent in Infinity, this includes models that do not deploy at the beginning of the game and also certain mission objectives. These are revealed when the models are deployed and when the mission objective has been achieved during the game. Another important aspect of Infinity is the significance of terrain to provide cover for miniatures, which gives a bonus to their armor statistic and a negative to the opponents rolls to hit. Terrain is also necessary to hamper longer range weapons such as sniper rifles. The importance of terrain has led to Corvus Belli making partnerships with several third-party companies to create official terrain for Infinity.  The Infinity Tournament System  A defining feature of Infinity the Game is the Infinity Tournament System, enables players to take part in tournaments with prize support from Corvus Belli using one of the official Infinity Tournament Packs. The results of each tournament are then uploaded onto the Infinity website where the results are used to rank the participants against players around the world.

John and Violet Brown House The Riverview Historic District is a historic district in Kankakee, Illinois, United States. The area around the Kankakee River is the oldest intact residential neighborhood in the city. It was originally settled by Emory Cobb, who used the land as pasture before deciding to erect a resort hotel. After the hotel burned down, the property was subdivided. The district includes 118 contributing buildings, including two Frank Lloyd Wright houses. History Kankakee, Illinois was founded in 1853 shortly after the Illinois Legislature approved the creation of Kankakee County; Kankakee was selected as the county seat. At this time the Illinois Central Railroad built a station, spurring rapid growth. By 1858, the population had swelled to 5,000. Early settler Lemuel Milk drained marshes in the area to create a habitable space along the Kankakee River.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201463.pdf Emory Cobb was the first settler to what would become the Riverview Historic District. Cobb was instrumental in the founding of Western Union, but retired in 1866 at age 34. He moved to Kankakee at this time and built his house at the southwest corner of what is now River Street and South Chicago Avenue. Cobb owned much of the land that would become the district, which he initially used as pasture. Heavily involved in Kankakee's early commercial development, Cobb decided to build a resort hotel on his property. The Riverview Hotel, located in what is now the triangle formed by Park Place, South Chicago Avenue, and South Greenwood Avenue, opened in 1887 and operated for ten years before it was destroyed in a fire. After the fire, Cobb subdivided most of his property for residential use. The neighborhood immediately became the most desired development in Kankakee. Merchants, lawyers, and industrialists built their houses, many in contemporary high styles. Foremost of these houses was the neighboring B. Harley Bradley House and the Warren Hickox House, both designed by prominent architect Frank Lloyd Wright. These were among Wright's first houses in the Prairie School style. Other houses in the district reflected Classical Revival and American Craftsman architecture. By 1935, almost the entire district had been developed.

Marsh (October 11, 1921 ‚Äì May 11, 2011) was a Democratic politician from Michigan who served as Mayor of Saginaw, and was the first African- American to hold that office. Marsh was one of the first black mayors in the United States. Early life Marsh was born on October 11, 1921, in Knoxville, Tennessee to Thomas and Saidye Marsh. He attended Camden Academy and Knoxville College before being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942. Marsh served in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, arriving at the Anzio Beachhead three days before Operation Shingle. Marsh was honorably discharged in December 1945. He then returned to Knoxville College, where he served as the president of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and graduated in June 1947. Marsh married the former Ruth Eleanor Claytor on September 1, 1948, in Roanoke, Virginia. Following their marriage, Marsh transferred from law school at the University of Michigan to the Wayne State University Law School since Ruth was a student at the University of Detroit. They had three children: Thomas, Walter, and Ter√©sa. Marsh graduated from law school in June 1950, and was admitted to the bar in January 1951, opening an office in Detroit where he practiced until moving to Saginaw. Move to Saginaw Marsh moved to Saginaw and opened a law office in April 1954. When he arrived, Saginaw was segregated city where no black man had ever won elected office. (In 1955, Harry W. Browne was poised to become Saginaw's first black city councilman, but a late swell of votes swung the result toward a white candidate by 79 votes.) Marsh became chairman of the now-extinct Human Rights Commission in 1958. A frequent contributor to The Saginaw News, Marsh ran for and won a seat on Saginaw City Council in 1961. Though tradition dictated that, as the highest vote-getter, Marsh would receive the title of mayor, he did not, believing that G. Stewart Francke, whom Marsh respected, should serve as mayor considering the difficulties facing the city. Marsh was elected mayor pro tempore in 1965, a century after abolition freed his grandfather from slavery. Mayor of Saginaw Marsh was the city's first African-American mayor. During a time when the 1967 Detroit riot threatened to spill north, Marsh was concerned about the threat of violence from both sides (racially and literally‚Äîhe ordered that a drawbridge connecting the two sides of the city be raised to stem the flow of traffic from both sides). Marsh formed a committee of over 200 community leaders to discuss concerns facing the city, later calling it his most important accomplishment. He traveled to Washington, D.C., to convince the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey that the city should be considered a Model City, part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. Look Magazine selected Saginaw as an All-American City and an open housing ordinance was passed during Marsh's tenure as mayor. He retired as the city's chief officer in 1969 to return to his law practice. Shortly after Marsh's retirement, the city council successfully petitioned to have the Interstate 675 bridge over the Saginaw River named in Marsh's honor. After politics and retirement Marsh was a co-founder of what was then called First State Bank, which was eventually acquired by National Bank of Detroit, now part of J.P. Morgan Chase Bank. He also served as a member of numerous local organizations and commissions. He retired from his law practice in 2000. Death Marsh died of congestive heart failure at the Aleda E. Lutz VA Medical Center in Saginaw on May 11, 2011. His remains were cremated. Legacy In 2012, just over a year to the day that Marsh died, the Bridge Center for Racial Harmony posthumously presented its Spirit of the River Award to Marsh. The award is given annually to individuals who have had a significant impact on the region. Marsh's wife Ruth and son Michael accepted the award on his behalf. The Henry Marsh Institute for Public Policy was founded by a local business leader and friend of Marsh's, and graduated its first class in 2011.

History The church was built between 1725 and 1730 in order to replace a more ancient building, which dated back to the middle of 16th century which was damaged by the earthquake of 1693; it had been the seat of the brotherhood since its birth in 1574. The new building was realised thanks to an amount of money given away by a priest, Giacinto Giglio, governor pro tempore of the brotherhood. The new seat was consecrated on 6 October 1730. Around the middle of the eighteenth century the facade and the bell tower were built. Between 1774 and 1792 the marble altars were constructed, while the marble inlaid floor was constructed about 1803‚àí04. The building was damaged by English air raids during the summer of 1943. Repairs were made in the years after the war. The church was damaged again by the earthquakes of 1990 and 2002. Thanks to the restoration work, funded by the Sicilian department of Civil Protection, it was reopened for worship. The church receives the adoration of Saints Alphius, Philadelphus and Cyrinus. Architecture The building is of an octagonal structure, however the different length of the final parts of the passage which link the vestibule and the presbytery gives a pronounced longitudinal course. The hall is covered by a lunette cloister vault, which extends upwards. The church features a marble inlaid floor. The interior decoration consists of Tuscan pilasters that support the trabeation, on which stands the tambour. The pilasters turn into the ribs of the vault. This one is divided into eight slices whose center represents the Agnus Dei. On one side of the octagon there are a wooden confessional and a side exit. The four sides of the octagon receive altars. The main one was built with precious stone materials and stands over a raised platform. In the centre of the vestibule there is a double stone which allows people to enter inside the crypt, where centuries ago, the brothers were buried. The facade is set on a basalt base which is divided into three parts by four Tuscan pilasters. These support remarkable eves. In the central part of the facade there is a simple entry portal; above it you can see a window crowned by a triangulate tympanum. In the left part there are narrow loopholes and a circular window which illuminates the bell tower stairway. On the top of the tower is a small temple decorated by four one-light windows, one on each side. It is covered by a small dome equipped with pinnacles and it shows an octagonal plant, similar to the church.

He played in the scrum half position. __TOC__ Sporting history The eight Irishmen selected for the 1938 British Lions tour to South Africa Morgan was educated at Belvedere College in Dublin. At the age of just 13, he played on the Belvedere College Junior Cup winning team of 1925. He made his debut for Ireland against England on 10 February 1934 in Lansdowne Road. He scored a try in the first half, although Ireland lost 3-14. This was the first of his 18 consecutive caps in the Four Nations competition. His career was brought to a premature conclusion by the onset of World War II. He gained one additional cap playing against New Zealand on 7 December 1935. Ireland lost 9-17. He was appointed Irish captain for the 1936-1937 season and retained the honor for the following two seasons (apart from one match against Wales in 1938). In 1938, he was selected as one of eight Irishmen on the 1938 British Lions tour to South Africa. He was not selected for the first two tests against the Springboks but did play in the final test which the Lions won. He was also honored as Captain of the Lions in their winning match against North East Districts. At club level, he captained Clontarf RFC to their first ever Leinster Senior Cup victory in 1936. When his school club Old Belvedere won senior status in 1937, George joined them and captained them to a first Leinster Senior Cup win in 1940. This was to be the first of seven consecutive Leinster Senior Cup wins for the Old Belvedere Club. He played on four occasions for the Barbarians F.C. between 1935 and 1937. As an administrator he was a member of the Irish Selectors from 1944 to 1947. He is one of few sportsmen to have played both rugby and cricket for Ireland. He played his cricket with Clontarf Cricket Club and won an international cap when selected for 'The Gentlemen of Ireland' XI against the MCC in July 1934. He was also a very good golfer and a member of the Royal Dublin Golf Club. At his best he played off a 9 handicap. Personal life On leaving school, he joined the (then) Royal Bank of Ireland. He worked in Dublin at the Smithfield and O'Connell Street branches of the bank. He was later appointed manager of the Drumcondra Branch of The Royal Bank. His final appointment was as manager of the Talbot Street branch of AIB. In September 1939, George married Kay Conroy. They had five children and lived on Clontarf Road. He was elected president of the Old Belvedere RFC from 1959 to 1961 and president of the Belvedere College Past Pupils Union in 1963-1964. He was also a trustee and honorary life member of the Old Belvedere Rugby Club.

Simons and Dr. Janet G. Travell. Originating from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), FSN does not follow the rules and principles of TCM and the chosen insertion points do not coincide with traditional acupuncture points. The similarities are limited to the distal insertion of the needle to the affected area, the needle itself being a non-injection needle, and the fact that both needles are manipulated and act on soft connective tissue. FSN abstains from the muscle and deep fascia layers and is confined to only the subcutaneous layer where collagen fibers are most abundant. As the subcutaneous layer is poorly innervated, pain is less than other needling therapies. FSN is also currently being used successfully to treat non-musculoskeletal conditions; however more research is to be carried out to conclude these findings. Mechanism FSN and traditional acupuncture may both share the same mechanism of action in terms of the measurable or physiological effects they relate on the body. The effects that FSN emits on the body are by means of mechanotransduction as the swaying of the needle triggers a response on the connective tissue, specifically the collagen fibers by stimulating signal transduction and gene expression in fibroblasts of the subcutaneous tissue.Langevin et al, 2006 A drawing or magnetic effect on connective tissue has been observed upon needle manipulation as the contraction and shape changes of fibroblasts cause pulling of collagen fibers and secondary alignment of fibroblasts and collagen fibers.Langevin et al, 2001 During manipulation of the needle, collagen fibers would wind and tighten around the needle shaft,Anderson, 1999 and dispersing of nociceptive substances and PH balance has also been observed in skeletal muscles.Langevin et al, 2001 As collagen fibers are most abundant in the subcutaneous layer, this may explain why FSN exhibits a more immediate effect than traditional acupuncture in relieving muscle dysfunction as the FSN comes into contact with more connective tissue during needle manipulation. Development Zhonghua Fu runs a successful pain clinic in Nanjing, China affiliated with Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine. At the FSN clinic for pain medicine, FSN is used as the sole means to treat musculoskeletal disorders and some chronic benign visceral disorders. Fu originally trained as a TCM doctor, completing his masters in acupuncture. While practicing and teaching traditional acupuncture in Guangzhou, he realized that several innovations were needed to improve and accelerate the acupuncture effect. Because some techniques for painful problems in the ancient HUANGDI INTERNAL CLASSIC were punctured obliquely surrounding some painful spots, Fu thought inserting horizontally is a good choice, and then FSN came into being after a number of trials. After completing his Ph.D, Fu conducted research in his lab for 2 years on arthritic rats. During these trials, when the needle was inserted into the local point of sensitivity, there were no profound changes in VAS and Range of Movements. Notable changes in VAS and Range of Movements were observed however when the needle was inserted parallel to the skin surface. The FSN needle The FSN needle is a modified trocar needle similar to an I.V. Catheter and has been patented in China. There are 3 parts to the needle: soft tube, protecting sheath, and needle core. The needle core is 31 mm in length and 1 mm in diameter. Each needle is individually packaged and sterilized with ethylene oxide gas.

She was completed in 1904 and sunk by enemy action in April 1917. Building and peacetime service In 1897‚Äì1903 the Midland Railway of England had Heysham Port on the coast of Lancashire built as a terminal for ferries to and from Ireland. In 1903 the Midland established its interest in Ireland by buying the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway. In 1904 the Midland took delivery of a pair of new passenger ferries from Clydeside shipyards in Glasgow to work between Heysham Port and Belfast Harbour. They came from different builders but they were sister ships: built by John Brown & Company of Clydebank, and Donegal built by Caird & Company of Greenock. Donegal had a triple-expansion steam engine rated at 386 NHP, giving her a speed of . She and Antrim worked between Heysham and Belfast from 1904 until they were requisitioned for UK Government service in the First World War. War service and loss Donegal was one of numerous ferries, many of them requisitioned from railway companies, that were converted into ambulance ships to carry wounded personnel from France back to Great Britain. Ambulance ships were classified as hospital ships under Hague Convention X of 1907 and as such were to be clearly marked and lit to make them easy to identify. Nevertheless, in the First World War the Imperial German Navy attacked and sank a number of British hospital ships. The UK Government then announced it would cease marking hospital ships, alleging that German vessels had used their markings and lighting to target them. On 1 March 1917 a German submarine tried to attack Donegal but the steamer managed to outrun her. Then on 17 April 1917 both Donegal and a larger ship, , were sunk by U-boats when carrying British wounded across the English Channel. Donegal had sailed from Le Havre bound for Southampton carrying 610 lightly wounded soldiers and 70 crew. She had a Royal Navy escort. She was about south of the Dean light vessel when the German Type UC II submarine torpedoed her. She sank with the loss of 29 wounded British soldiers and 12 of her crew. A Royal Naval Reserve Lieutenant, H Holehouse, jumped from his ship into the sea to recover one of Donegals wounded soldiers from the water. The man did not recover, but the Royal Humane Society awarded Lieut. Holehouse its bronze medal. Titanic connections Two of Donegals crew, Archie Jewell and Arthur John Priest, had served on and survived her sinking in April 1912. Jewell had been one of Titanics lookouts (although not on watch when she struck the iceberg) and Priest had been one of her stokers. Priest had also been on the liner when she foundered on her maiden voyage in 1907, and on when she was damaged in a collision with in 1911. Priest then served on the armed merchant cruiser when she and the German armed merchant cruiser sank each other in February 1916. Both Jewell and Priest then served on Titanics White Star Line sister ship , and survived when she was sunk in November 1916. When Donegal sank, Priest survived yet again but Jewell was killed. In 1917 Priest was awarded the Mercantile Marine Ribbon for his service in the war. Wreck Donegals wreck lies intact on her port side in about of water.

Born and initially working in Hamburg, two of his brothers Peter and Meno, and his father Jonas all were engravers. Haas visited as a child the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, where he quickly made much progress in art. In 1776, when he was 20‚Äì21 years old, he won the gold medal. This brought the right to go abroad as the Academy \\"boarder\\" , but travel grants seemed slow in coming and were both few and small, for Haas' case only 100 Rdl. customary annual two or three years. Although one in Paris would not get far with this insignificant sum, it gave Haas, however, enough to get on the road to France's capital, where he arrived and was able to study under Nicolas de Launays and Johan Frederik Clemens. After in 1781 to have had his scarce scholarship increased and prolonged studied Haas eagerly went ahead and completed in 1782 a beautiful wall Diomedes eaten up by his own horses. On the basis of this, Haas was a member of the Academy in Paris and also in January 1783 the Academy in Copenhagen, to which city he almost simultaneously thus returned. Being a member of two academies was a prudent, but Haas needed to find employment. But he had difficulties with this, because the time was cool to both the arts and artists. In addition, there was no shortage of engravers in Denmark, and there were more artists than Haas (Clemens, Johan Martin Preisler) . Haas searched in vain for a professorship at the model school, and unsuccessfully for free residence at Kunsthal Charlottenborg, nothing would initially succeed him. He got the title of hofkobberstikker and an annual allowance of the King's box, but the work was limited, and his circumstances were cramped. In 1810 he managed to become a professor at the model school, but this late tailwind did not improve his circumstances, he was poor and remained poor. In 1811 he was auditor and treasurer at the Academy. Haas was already an old man when he in 1809 got the time and could afford to marry. His wife was called Johanne Christine, n√©e S√∏nderup.

Early life  Wise was born in Manhattan, New York City, New York.  Education  In 1951, Wise graduated from Columbia University.  Career  In 1951, Wise joined the New York Herald-Tribune and became the paper's White House correspondent in 1960.

Beginning in 1962 with an examination of the Lockheed U-2, Wise published a series of non-fiction books, the first three with Thomas B. Ross. Their book Invisible Government (1964), exposed the role of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in foreign policy. This included CIA coups in Guatemala (Operation PBSuccess) and Iran (Operation Ajax) and the Bay of Pigs Invasion. It also revealed the CIA's attempts to overthrow President Sukarno in Indonesia and the covert operations taking place in Laos and Vietnam. Wise and Ross claimed that the CIA considered buying up the entire printing of Invisible Government, but this idea was rejected when Random House pointed out that if this happened they would have to print a second edition. A confidential CIA review of Invisible Government, declassified in 1995, declared that \\"In Great Britain, which is second to none in its devotion to liberty, there exists an Official Secrets Act under which the authors would have been tried and sentenced to prison. ‚Ä¶ That much of this material has been printed before does not reduce the value to the Soviets of having it gathered in one volume under such genuine American auspices.\\"Charles E.

It is known for its handling of sexuality and LGBT content.The Sexuality of Monsterhearts, Bitch Magazine It has been nominated or shortlisted for five awards.RPG Geek Monsterhearts listing Setting Monsterhearts is set in a fictional high school that along with the surrounding environment is named and fleshed out by all players during character creation. In order to start creating the setting, each player first picks a character class (called a \\"skin\\"), with each skin being both a type of monster and a metaphor for the struggles of a teenager. As a part of the character creation process and by using the elements provided as a part of their skins, the players define their characters' relationships with each other and with other elements of the setting. Then the homeroom for their high school class is drawn, with the players filling in where their characters sit. The GM (known in Monsterhearts as the MC) then fills in some of the rest, leaving blanks for further exploration. At the end of character creation the characters will all have \\"strings\\" on each other that can be spent to manipulate, and more can be gained in the course of play. Skins Each skin comes with a collection of \\"Moves\\" or special abilities, (every skin starting with either two or three), a default \\"Darkest Self\\" that indicates what happens when things go really wrong, and a \\"Sex Move\\" that indicates what happens when that character has sex with another. In addition to the default skins found in the rulebook, each edition has additional skins available from the developer or third parties, and advice for modifying skins or creating new ones. The default skins in Monsterhearts are the Fae, the Ghost, the Ghoul, the Infernal, the Mortal, the Queen, the Vampire, the Werewolf, and the Witch, with first edition adding the Chosen and second edition the Hollow. Sexuality and queer content In Monsterhearts any PC may roll to turn any other character on, and all the characters have a sex move (as indicated above). This is explicitly because as a teenager you don't get to choose what turns you on, and because \\"Monsterhearts is a game about the confusion that arises when your body and your social world start changing without your permission.\\"Monsterhearts first edition p43 It also, because of this, has a double page dedicated to using Monsterhearts to explore queer content. This approach to sexuality has drawn comment, with Bitch Magazine commenting, \\"Indeed, nearly every rule related to sex and sexuality in Monsterhearts is a game manifestation of real-life sexual dynamics, good and bad, healthy and unhealthy. Instead of the rote, heterosexist portrayals of sex and sexuality you might find in other games, Monsterhearts gleefully encourages people of all identities to explore sexuality in every permutation, often with great self-examination and as uncomfortably as possible. But for a game with such a depth of emotional/sexual content, it's remarkably free of sexism. It also doesn't slut-shame, or enforce traditional gendered tropes of judgment about sexual behavior.\\" Gameplay Monsterhearts uses the Powered by the Apocalypse engine created for Apocalypse World and also used in Dungeon World. Whenever a player has declared that they are doing something challenging and risky, the MC asks them to roll 2d6 and add their relevant statistic to perform the relevant move. On a 10+ they succeed, on a 7-9 they succeed but have to take a partial success, or make a hard choice, and on a 6 or less the MC gets to make a Hard Move representing something going badly wrong. Strings against specific characters are gained through moves, and through turning people on - and may be spent either for a bonus to a dice roll after rolling, to inflict a condition on the target, or to offer them an XP to do something the offering player suggests. Like Apocalypse World, XP is also gained by moves or by using one of two statistics: the one the person with the greatest hold over your character (counted in strings) nominated at the start of the session, and the one the MC nominated. Requirements to play * 3-5 players (one to play the MC) * Two ordinary six-sided dice each * A different \\"skin\\" for each player * Quick reference sheets * However many sessions the players find fun Statistics and moves The statistics in Monsterhearts are Hot, Cold, Volatile, and Dark. Hot can be used to \\"turn someone on\\" or (in the first edition) \\"manipulate an NPC\\", cold to \\"shut someone down\\" or to keep one's nerve and \\"hold steady\\", volatile to \\"lash out physically\\" or run away\\", and dark to \\"Gaze Into The Abyss\\" and for most skin-specific magical functions. History Monsterhearts started out as a joke game, using Apocalypse World to run Twilight, although Jennifer's Body and Ginger Snaps are cited as inspirations the designer prefers. The initial playtest of Monsterhearts started in 2010,Profile of Monsterhearts on RPG.net the same year Apocalypse World was produced.

The park is split into three broad recreational zones, starting at The Leas Lift (on Lower Sandgate Road) and heading west. The formal zone comprises pine avenues and flower gardens, planted for all-year-round interest. The fun zone comprises the large free adventure play area and the amphitheatre. The last area, the wild zone, has been created for a diverse wildlife habitat, with careful management. History Leas Cliff, Folkestone. Largely artificial cliff-side gardens laid out in Victorian times along the winding path down the cliff from the bandstand on the Leas to the amphitheatre In 1784, a landslip created a new strip of land between the beach and the cliffside, the length of the coast from Folkestone Harbour to Sandgate. A ribbon of land a few meters wide. In 1828, the Earl of Radnor built a toll road providing an easy route between Folkestone harbour and Sandgate. The original toll road costs were - motor car 10p, motorcycle with sidecar 2 and 1/2 p, motorcycle 2p, bicycle, horse and handcart 1/2 p. The original toll house (designed by the architect Sydney Smirke) remains within the park On either side of the toll road, land was cultivated and grazed. Old field boundaries are still used within the park, and the 'Cow Path' is the old drove route from The Leas. In 1877, a series of paths was constructed. The Ordnance Survey map of 1898 (of the area) shows some of these paths, Including a path from the Leas Shelter on the Upper Leas leading down to the road. The Leas Lift opened in 1885, to improve access between the seafront and the upper Leas (of Folkestone). The park and seafront with their new pier, switchback ride (an early form of roller coaster - railway along the promenade), and beach amusements proved to be so popular, that a second lift was added in 1890. The remains of a further lift serving the 'Metropole Hotel' (now a block of apartments) can still be seen (on the Upper Leas), and yet another lift connected the western end of the Leas with Sandgate. In 1913, the area then known as Leas Cliff was leased by the Radnor Estate to the local corporation, to be used mainly for a park, but the estate still kept the tolls from the toll road. In the park, tea rooms, shelters and woodland walks were provided among the newly planted holm oaks (Quercus ilex) and pine trees so that people could ‚Äútake the air‚Äù. The 'Zig Zag Path' was built in 1921 as a new attraction and to provide work for the unemployed. This also leads down from the Upper leas to the park and seafront. The cliff-face and grottoes along the path, are entirely artificial, as they are built from waste material and coated in special cement called Pulhamite after its creator James Pulham. The path is now a listed structure. The Leas Cliff Hall was opened in 1927 as a replacement for a much smaller concert room called the 'Leas Shelter'. The opening by Prince Henry was broadcast live to the nation by the BBC. In 1973, due to a lack of traffic on the toll road, the Radnor Estate closed the route to traffic and sold the land to the council. In 1980, the empty toll house was sold to private ownership. Coastal Park Footbridge in the Formal Zone of the Park In May 2000, the first phase of the ¬£1.2 million 11-hectare Coastal Park was opened by celebrity weatherman Ian McCaskill. The park regeneration was funded by SEEDA, Shepway District Council and the European Union. In 2003, Phase II was funded by a ¬£1.4 million grant by the Heritage Lottery Fund of the National Lottery. This provided funding for ground works to be carried out in February 2005. Then planting of the pine avenues, flower gardens and picnic sites could take place. Then park furniture and information signs were erected. In May 2006, this phase of the park was officially opened. This also included a stone labyrinth designed by Clare Danstead for Shepway District Council for the park in May 2008. 'As a contribution to peace and harmony within the ever-changing environment and community of Folkestone. The labyrinth is a uni-cursal pathway leading to a centre and back out again. This is used as a form of walking meditation or prayer. During 2007, the Coastal Park received four awards, including the Green Flag, best regional and best overall Regeneration Project from the Royal Town Planning Institute 2007 and winner in the Landscape category of the 2007 Kent Design Awards. In 2008, an International Sculpture Triennial took place in Folkestone, with some works being displayed in the park. This art initiative was promoted by a board of trustees including Roger De Haan, Dr Stephen Deuchar (Former Director of Tate Britain), Timothy Llewellyn (Director of the Henry Moore Foundation and the Viscount of Folkestone).

It lies between Minster and Sheerness. Within the park is a former military ditch/canal from Marine Parade (beside the coast) heading south-westerly towards West Minster (a suburb of Sheerness). History After the Dutch Navy, attacked the blockhouse, built to protect Sheerness Royal Navy dockyard from attack in the Raid on the Medway. In 1667, a plan was drawn up to defend the landward side of the dockyard. A flooded ditch between two demi-bastions (a half-bastion, which has one face and one flank). They were then named 'Queenborough' and 'Minster'. They were started in 1667 and completed in 1685. In 1782, the ditch was further extended, now heading from the Medway (on the west) to the Thames (on the east). After the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom in 1860, which decided that the Dockyard needed more defensive works on its landward side. Due to economic pressures the simplest means was to build an earthwork defensive line across the Sheerness peninsula, 1 km south-east of the earlier bastion-trace defences of the Sheerness Lines. These were called the 'Queenborough lines'. Lands were then acquired under Defence Act, 1860. The lines were completed in 1868, they are 3.5 km long. The rampart (defensive wall) is constructed of earth and shingle and measures between 15.5 m to 17m wide and between 1.9m and 2.5m high. A bridge lead over the lines from Halfway into Sheerness and the dockyard. Between 1889 - 1891, Barton's Point Battery was built, to defend the mouth of the River Medway from attack. Initially, plans were drawn up that forts were to be built either end of the canal. But only the Barton's Point battery was ever built. Then in 1895, four cannons were installed. 2 x 9.2inch breech loaders and 2 x 6inch breech loaders. In 1899, a rifle range was created in front of the canal. In 1905, 2 hotchkiss machine guns were installed on vavasseur mountings. By 1914, the battery was unused and partially demolished. In 1926, all the guns were removed and the battery became a training base instead. Along the canal, four air raid shelters were built during World War II. These are currently sealed. In June 2012, the Queenborough Lines became a listed ancient monument. No.1404499. Later the battery site was used as a holiday camp. The Queenborough Lines now known locally as 'Canal Bank'. Coastal Park The park is used for various outdoor leisure activities, including cycling, water sports and walking (with walking trails along the canal). The lake is available for fishing, sailing, windsurfing, kayaking and canoeing, and fishing permits can be purchased from The Boat House Caf√©. In 2013, dead fish were found on the bank of the lake. The Environment Agency investigated, but no harmful effects of the water could be found, and the fish deaths were blamed on seasonal effects. The Sheerness Way cycling route runs through the park and along Queenborough Lines towards Sheerness. The Park is also home to the 'Sheppey Model Engineering Society' which offers miniature steam train rides on a Model 0-4-0T Steam Locomotive No.93 'Janine' (based on a Hudswell Clarke Steam locomotive). Within the park is a field for flying model aeroplanes, used by the 'Bartons Point Model Flying Club',. In 1954, Sheppey Sea Cadet Unit No 301 moved to the park, they were part of the Navy League Sea Cadet Corps since 29 June 1942. In 2011, a large children‚Äôs Adventure Play Area was opened. It was designed by children from The Isle of Sheppey Academy and built with funding (¬£87,000) from the Big Lottery. In May, a funfair was in the park, in June, the Harmony Folk Festival took place.

He was a leading scholar in the field of American social and intellectual history, and his particular emphasis was on military history and the history of technology.\\"Irving Brinton Holley Jr.\\", Headquarters Gazette 26:3 (Fall 2013), p. 5.  Biography  A native of Torrington, Connecticut, and graduate of Wilbraham Academy, Holley attended Amherst College and graduated in 1940 (cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa). He then pursued a doctoral degree at Yale University, and for his academic success in his first year received the Tew Prize as Outstanding Scholar in History. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Holley enlisted in the United States Army and became an aerial gunner. Promoted to staff sergeant, he was an instructor at Harlingen Army Air Base in Texas. Subsequently, he attended Office Candidate School at Miami Beach, Florida, commissioning in April 1944, and then headed a gunnery school at Charleston Army Air Base. Following that, he was assigned for technical intelligence work at the Headquarters, Air Materiel Command, at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio. Promoted to the rank of captain by the conclusion of the war, Holley returned to the civilian world in 1946 but remained in the reserves. From 1945 to 1947, Holley was a faculty member at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces before taking a position at Duke University for the remainder of his career. He would ultimately rise to the rank of Major General, retiring in 1981.Holley, Headquarters Gazette, p. 5.; biographical reference in I. B.

Holley deposited genealogical material on the Holley family (1777‚Äì2008) with the Connecticut Historical Society.Irving B. Holley collection of family papers, 1777‚Äì2008  Scholarly impact  Holley's scholarly work began while he was in uniform during World War II. In 1944 and 1945, he was based at Wright Field, in Dayton, Ohio. There he wrote three works analyzing research and development programs for aircraft in the Army over the preceding decades. These were \\"Evolution of the Liaison-Type Airplane, 1917‚Äì1944\\", \\"Development of Aircraft Gun Turrets in the Army Air Forces\\", and \\"Rotary-Wing Aircraft in the Army of Air Forces, a Study in Research and Development Policies\\". Holley later identified a theme that ran through these three monographs: \\"the pace of development for any weapon during the between-war years is chiefly determined by the extent to which its mission or operational function is known and defined.\\" Holley saw the pace of development as slow when there was \\"no effective system for determining doctrine.\\"I. B. Holley, Ideas and Weapons (Yale University Press, 1953): Preface. His subsequent work Ideas and Weapons was an outgrowth of that initial work during World War II, and was part of what Holley identified as a larger project to \\"distill from past experience in the development of air material those lessons which might be of help in formulating policies for exploiting the air weapons more successfully in the future\\" and possibly certain principles regarding weapons development.Holley, Ideas and Weapons, Preface. Ideas and Weapons attempted to examine both the use of aerial weapons by the United States in World War I and the problem of weapons development more generally. Drawing on an extensive body of primary material (including records from the U.S. National Archives, the Air Force's Central Files, the Army Air Force Historical Office, and collections at different service colleges), Holley established a significant, archivally- based analysis where no effective work on the period had existed before. That larger research project yielded Holley's second major work, Buying Aircraft: Mat√©riel Procurement for the Army Air Forces, published in 1964 as Special Studies volume in the official history of the United States Army in World War II series. In that volume, Holley explored procurement in a broad sense: \\"the computation of requirements, the evolution of internal organization, the relationship and accommodation of conflicts between executive and legislative agencies, the character and capabilities of the aircraft industry, and many other similar facets...\\" necessary together for a proper understanding the more basic elements of procurement, involving contracts, plant construction, and so on.I.

A native of Sweden, he emigrated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became a teacher and a librarian. As the first librarian of the Milwaukee Public Library, he became a significant figure in the city and in the library profession, becoming the seventh President of the American Library Association. He left both the city and the profession permanently following his arrest for embezzlement. Early life and education Linderfelt was born in Sweden in 1847. He became an orphan after the deaths of his mother when he was five and his father when he was eleven. Linderfelt persevered and earned a doctorate from Uppsala University. He emigrated to Milwaukee in 1870 and taught classics at Milwaukee College. In 1875, he was married to a woman whose name has been reported as Maggie Cooper or Margie E. Parker. By 1880 they had the first two of their four children, a son and daughter, and lived modestly at 278 Pleasant Street. Milwaukee Public Library Central Library of the Milwaukee Public Library. The Milwaukee Public Library dates to February 7, 1878, when the Wisconsin State Legislature authorized the city to form a public library. Linderfelt had taken an interest in libraries and was hired to be its first librarian in 1880. With his new post, Linderfelt joined the ranks of Milwaukee's elite and his family took up residence on Grand Avenue. He also made the acquaintance of numerous important figures in the library profession, and was especially close to William Frederick Poole. Under Linderfelt's leadership, the Milwaukee Public Library developed a new charging system and a pencil dater for due dates that was widely adopted by libraries. He wrote professional articles and his book Eclectic Card Catalog Rules, based on the work of Karl Dziatzko as well as numerous English language librarians like Melvil Dewey, was published by Charles Ammi Cutter in 1890. He also wrote on other topics, such as the book Volap√ºk: An Easy Method of Acquiring the Universal Language (1888), about the constructed language. Linderfelt was a founder and the first president of the Wisconsin Library Association in February 1891. He was active in the American Library Association, serving as a councilor from 1883 to 1891 and vice president from 1890 to 1891. He was instrumental in local arrangements for the ALA's 1886 annual conference in Milwaukee, including an eight-day, 1500 mile post-conference train excursion afterwards arranged by Linderfelt, which included a steamboat trip on the Dells of the Wisconsin River. In 1891, he was elected to follow Samuel Swett Green as President of the American Library Association. Linderfelt's most significant achievement was the arrangements for the construction of a library and museum building at 814 Wisconsin Avenue. A national competition was held and 74 designs were proposed. One of the entrants was a 25-year-old Frank Lloyd Wright, whose entry was helpful in publicizing his blooming career. The winning entry was a neo-renaissance structure from the Wisconsin architecture firm of Ferry & Clas, which was constructed at a cost of $780,000. It opened on October 3, 1898. Today, the building is still in use as the Milwaukee Public Library's Central Library and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Embezzlement charges K.A. Linderfelt from the May 5, 1892 edition of the Milwaukee Sentinel Beginning in at least 1883, Linderfelt began embezzling large sums of money from the Library, chiefly by double-billing the board for Library expenditures and pocketing the difference. He never provided a motive for his theft, but it was widely speculated, and argued by his lawyer, that the financial demands of Linderfelt's prestigious position in society were not met by his modest public salary. He was first investigated in 1888 over a shortfall in the collection of library fines, but the missing money was reimbursed, reportedly by two members of the Library board of trustees, and the matter was dropped. However, following the revelation that Milwaukee School Board secretary A.H. Schattenberg had embezzled over $50,000, and his subsequent suicide, a citywide audit was conducted. City accountant Carl Jackwitz discovered Linderfelt had embezzled over $4,000 and following a meeting with some of the trustees, including Harrison Carroll Hobart, and Mayor Peter J. Somers, Linderfelt confessed and was arrested on April 28, 1892. The library profession was stunned by Linderfelt's arrest. The news was \\"a great shock\\", Green wrote later in his history of the profession. Green wrote to Poole: \\"I should have as soon suspected myself as Linderfelt\\" and others had similar reactions of disbelief. Many librarians wrote letters of support for Linderfelt. The ALA acted swiftly to mitigate the damage to the image of the profession. On May 22, the executive board of the ALA moved that William I. Fletcher be appointed president following Linderfelt's resignation, and that he be officially recorded as president retroactively for the entire term, essentially erasing Linderfelt from the historical record of the ALA. A month later, Melvil Dewey was elected ALA president for the next term. The incident was seen as a triumph of newer librarians like Dewey over the \\"old guard\\" represented by Poole, of whom Linderfelt was seen as a protege. In Milwaukee, Linderfelt received strong support from members of the board of trustees and the city's elite, who pushed to reimburse the city and reinstate the librarian. However, local newspapers objected, especially following revelations of the previous investigation and that Linderfelt had stolen nearly twice as much as initially thought, over $9,000. On July 12, Linderfelt pleaded nolo contendere and Judge A. Scott Sloan, saying that \\"further punishment would be wrong\\", issued a suspended sentence. Linderfelt left Milwaukee that day for a promised job at the Library Bureau in Boston. The lenient sentence was met with outrage in the city. Newspapers inveighed against the decision and residents held \\"indignation meetings\\" to agitate against it. Within days, upon the urging of Mayor Somers, the district attorney scrambled to find new charges to file against Linderfelt and ordered his arrest in Boston. But Linderfelt had already left Boston and was sighted in England later that month. Poole wrote: \\"They let him off without punishment, and are now chasing him around the world to arrest him for another trial.\\" Later life Linderfelt settled in Paris and studied medicine. His wife and children joined him there. At the end of his life, Linderfelt worked for the journal La Semaine M√©dicale. Instead of going to Paris, his eldest son, Karl E. Linderfelt, dropped out of Beloit College and lived with uncles in Cripple Creek, Colorado. He joined the Colorado National Guard and was one of the commanders at the Ludlow Massacre, noted for his aggression and profanity and for assaulting and allegedly murdering strike leader Louis Tikas. His daughter Anna Linderfelt Fisher became a Red Cross worker during World War I, and an advisor to Faisal I of Iraq.William T. Ellis, \\"American Woman Made Captain in Army of Syria\\" Star Tribune (October 2, 1919): 12. via Newspapers.com Legacy Linderfelt has been ignored or received cursory treatment in histories of both Milwaukee and the library profession in the United States, including the work of Linderfelt's immediate successor at the Milwaukee Public Library and longtime assistant Theresa Elmendorf. Noted library historian Wayne A. Wiegand wrote about Linderfelt in a two part article published in 1977 in American Libraries, the official magazine of the American Library Association. In the article, Wiegand expressed hope that librarians would remember Linderfelt \\"to provide some balance against the too- frequent eulogistic treatment accorded the Winsors, Pooles, and Deweys of library history\\" and that the ALA would officially acknowledge Linderfelt as a past ALA President for the sake of \\"historical accuracy\\". A librarian responding to Wiegand's article echoed his sentiments, noting Linderfelt's absence in the Dictionary of American Biography and the National Cyclopedia of American Biography and Wiegand's upcoming article about Linderfelt for the Dictionary of American Library Biography. , Linderfelt has not appeared on the official list of past ALA Presidents. In 1991, the centennial of the founding of the Wisconsin Library Association, former WLA presidents began the tradition of annually passing an urn with non-human ashes representing Linderfelt to each president at the end of their term. Linderfelt was inducted into the Wisconsin Library Hall of Fame in 2009.

A delivery drone is an autonomous vehicle, often an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), used to transport packages, food or other goods. Types of deliveries In healthcare The RQ-7 Shadow is capable of delivering a \\"Quick-MEDS\\" canister to front-line troops. DHL parcel service subsidiary of Deutsche Post AG tested a \\"microdrones md4-1000\\" for delivery of medicine. UAVs can transport medicines and vaccines, and retrieve medical samples, into and out of remote or otherwise inaccessible regions. (Click \\"Show transcript\\".) * 2014, a Dutch student created a prototype 'Ambulance drone' which would be capable of rapidly delivering defibrillators and include live stream communication capability allowing paramedics to remotely observe and instruct on-scene individuals in how to use the defibrillators. * July 2015, the FAA granted NASA, the drone delivery company Flirtey and Virginia Tech approval to deliver medicine to a rural Virginia medical clinic. Flirtey also made the first fully autonomous FAA-approved urban delivery in March 2016, when it delivered bottled water, emergency food, and a first aid kit to an uninhabited residential area in Hawthorne, Nevada. * 2016, the Rwandan government partnered with the company Zipline International Inc. to build a distribution center near the town of Muhanga, from which the company's drones are used to deliver blood and pharmaceutical products to 21 facilities. * March 2017, the company Matternet partnered with the Swiss Post to launch the first medical drone delivery network in Switzerland. * October 2017, REMSA Health, an ambulance and emergency service provider, partnered with Flirtey, to dispatch portable defibrillators when 911 callers report cardiac arrest symptoms in Northern Nevada. *December 2018, Swoop Aero, an Australian drone logistics company, partnered with UNICEF and the Vanuatu Ministry of Health to deliver vaccines in remote areas of the Pacific island nation. A baby on Erromango island became the first person in the world to receive a vaccine delivered by commercial drone. *June 2019, Drone Delivery Canada conducted a pilot with Peel Region Paramedics and showed a 100% success rate, proving that Drone Delivery Canada's proprietary logistics system is able to reduce the response times as compared to ground ambulance and can enable first responders with a potentially life saving drone technology. https://www.newswire.ca/news- releases/drone-delivery-canada-successfully-completes-phase-one-of-aed-on-the- fly-pilot-with-peel-region-paramedics-807614473.html *August 2019, Swoop Aero partnered with the NGOs VillageReach and GAVI to deliver vaccines in the Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. *October 2019, CVS, a nation-wide drug store and pharmacy chain, is partnering with UPS, to make drone deliveries for shuttling medical samples. The packages will be up to five pounds and will be left on a back yard. Food delivery In 2017 drone delivery startup Flytrex deployed a commercial drone delivery route in Iceland's capital, Reykjavik Early prototypes of food delivery drones include the Tacocopter demonstration by Star Simpson, which was a taco delivery concept utilizing a smartphone app to order drone-delivered tacos in San Francisco area. The revelation that it didn't exist as a delivery system or app led to it being labelled a hoax.A similar concept named the \\"burrito bomber\\" was tested in 2012. That same year, a Free University of Berlin student project examined the use of drones for pizza delivery. In 2013, as part of an advertising campaign, an independent Domino's UK franchise tested the Domicopter. Similar flights were conducted in India and Russia, but lacked regulatory approval. A partnership between 7-Eleven and Flirtey resulted in the first FAA-approved delivery to a residence in the United States in July 2016. The following month, the company partnered with Domino's in New Zealand to launch the first commercial drone delivery service. Marriott International used drones to deliver cocktails and drinks to the tables of guests at multiple properties in 2017 including the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Chicago, IL. The hotel chain formed a partnership with DJI in 2016, and used the company's drones for its indoor drink delivery. Postal deliveries Different postal companies from Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Singapore and Ukraine have undertaken various drone trials as they test the feasibility and profitability of unmanned delivery drone services. The USPS has been testing delivery systems with HorseFly Drones. Legislation In February 2014, the prime minister and cabinet affairs minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced that the UAE planned to launch a fleet of UAVs for civilian purposes.Kerr, Simon (11 February 2014) UAE to develop fleet of drones to deliver public services, The Financial Times, World News, Retrieved 12 February 2014 Plans were for the UAVs to use fingerprint and eye-recognition systems to deliver official documents such as passports, ID cards and licenses, and supply emergency services at accidents. A battery-powered prototype four-rotor UAV about half a meter across was displayed in Dubai.Sleiman, Mirna (10 February 2014) Aerial ID card renewal: UAE to use drones for government services Reuters, Retrieved 12 February 2014 In the United States, initial attempts at commercial use of UAVs were blocked by FAA regulation. In June 2014, the FAA published a document that listed activities not permitted under its regulations, including commercial use, which the organization stated included \\"delivering packages to people for a fee\\" or offered as part of a \\"purchase or another offer.\\" In August 2016, updated FAA rules were enacted. The new rules included guidelines for commercial use of small UAVs stating they must weigh less than , fly up to a maximum of , at a speed of no greater than , could only be operated during daytime, and that drone operators must also qualify for flying certificates and be at least 16-years old. In June 2017, the United States Senate proposed legislation to allow package deliveries by drones. In October 2017, a Presidential directive was issued that called on the FAA and Transportation Department to work with local officials to create initiatives that would enable American companies to eventually use drones for delivery purposes. In December 2019, the FAA adopted a ruling requiring all unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) (drones) to be equipped with a devise to identify them citing ‚ÄúAll UAS operating in the airspace of the United States, with very few exceptions, would be subject to the requirements of this rule\\". Experiments  2013  Amazon Prime Air ‚Äì Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos' December 2013 announcement that Amazon was planning rapid delivery of lightweight commercial products using UAVs was met with skepticism, with perceived obstacles including federal and state regulatory approval, public safety, reliability, individual privacy, operator training and certification, security (hacking), payload thievery, and logistical challenges. In December 2013, in a research project of Deutsche Post AG subsidiary DHL, a sub-kilogram quantity of medicine was delivered via a prototype Microdrones \\"Parcelcopter\\", raising speculation that disaster relief may be the first place the company will use the technology. DHL Parcelcopter is currently in trials in Germany.  2014  In July 2014 it was revealed Amazon was working on its 8th and 9th drone prototypes, some that could fly 50 miles per hour and carry 5-pound packages, and had applied to the FAA to test them. In August 2014, Google revealed it had been testing UAVs in Australia for two years. The Google X program known as \\"Project Wing\\" aims to produce drones that can deliver not only products sold via e-commerce, but larger delivery items. In September 2014, FedEx was reportedly testing integration of drone delivery with their existing logistics model. In December 2014, French mail services company La Poste unveiled an experimental delivery drone project.  2015  In February 2015, Hangzhou based e-commerce provider Ali Baba started delivery drone service in a partnership with Shanghai YTO Express in which it delivered tea to 450 customers around select cities in China. In March 2015, Shenzhen-based SF Express started providing delivery services with Xaircraft drones in China. On the 13th March 2015, in Sheffield, UK-based FPS Distribution completed the first commercial delivery in the United Kingdom using a UAV.FPS Distribution Press Release (13 March 2015) First UK Commercial Delivery with Drone In May 2015, CJ Express announced a partnership with the Ministry of Public Safety and Security for disaster relief, becoming the first private company in South Korea to operate delivery drones.  2016  In March 2016, Flirtey conducted the first fully autonomous FAA approved drone delivery in an urban setting in the U.S. In April 2016, a joint project in Japan involving the central government, Chiba City, research institutions and companies including Rakuten was launched to trial home drone deliveries in an urban area. A similar test project was carried out in Naka, Tokushima in February 2016 as a way to facilitate shopping for people who live in a depopulated area. In Japan both the e-commerce behemoth Rakuten and retail giant AEON have undertaken package delivery tests. AEON conducted a drone delivery test which involved delivering a bottle of wine, toward targeting actual drone home delivery services for the year 2019 for Aeon Mall, the company's online shopping site. Rakuten on the other hand, which in early 2016 delivered refreshments and golf balls within a golf course, expanded upon that test service and in November 2016 performed a new test of package delivery service with upgraded capability. Making improvements over the previous test, Rakuten partnered with mobile phone company NTT DoCoMo to integrate the use of the cellular LTE network for long distance delivery capability testing. And in addition to modifications to the product ordering app and drone control dashboard, the new delivery drone included a number of performance enhancements including water-resistance, long-distance flight with fully autonomous control and was equipped with a parachute to slow the speed of the fall in an emergency, offering a greater level of safety. The delivery of cargo using the drone was carried out at the Inage Seaside Park in Chiba City, Japan and adjacent sea area. In December 2016, Amazon made its first drone delivery using a drone in the United Kingdom. 2017 In China, JD.com has been aggressively developing its drone capabilities. As of June 2017, JD.com had seven different types of delivery drones in testing or operation across four provinces in China (Beijing, Sichuan, Shaanxi and Jiangsu). The drones are capable of delivering packages weighing between 5 and 30 kg (11 to 66 lbs) while flying up to 100 km/hr (62 mph). The drones do not deliver goods directly to people‚Äôs homes. Rather, they automatically fly along fixed routes from warehouses to special landing pads where one of JD.com‚Äôs 300,000 local contractors then delivers the packages to the customers‚Äô doorsteps in the rural villages. The e-commerce giant is now working on a 1 metric ton (1,000 kg) delivery drone which will be tested in Shaanxi. Flytrex, an Israeli startup which specializes in developing drone delivery solutions, partnered with AHA in 2015, Iceland's largest eCommerce website, and together they initiated a drone delivery route which would shorten AHA's delivery times from 30 minutes, to less than 5. The system was deployed on 25 August 2017 and is now delivering food and small electronics via drones.  2018  In January 2018, Boeing unveiled a prototype of a cargo drone for up to 500 lb (227 kg) payloads, an electric flying testbed that completed flight tests at the Boeing Research & Technology research center in Missouri.  2019  UPS in association with Matternet started a three year medical delivery trial in Raleigh At the 2019 AI conference, Amazon announced that the drone deliveries will start rolling out in select US cities within months. The service was delayed previously due to safety and regulation approvals.  2020  NHS in association with Wingcopter and skyports carried out trials for delivering personal protective equipment (PPE) and Covid-19 testing kits to the island of Mull in Scotland. Commercial systems 2016 Zipline International Inc. signed a deal with the Rwandan government, allowing the construction of a medical distribution center near Muhanga. Rwanda has a mountainous geography and poor road conditions making an aerial delivery system more efficient as of May 2018 they had delivered over 7000 units of blood this way. By January 2020 they have made over 26,500 deliveries. The design of the electric aircraft, called Zips look like small propeller airplanes, enabling them to fly fast and over a long distance (typically 150 km on a single charge), in any weather short of a hurricane, they cannot independently takeoff or land instead using an Assisted take-off and for landing they use Arresting gear. During the delivery the plane does not land, instead it drops to a low height and the package drops to the ground, slowed by a parachute-like air brake. 2018 In October 2018, Vanuatu (a Pacific island nation) awarded contracts to two companies, Swoop Aero of Melbourne, Australia, to deliver to health facilities on the Epi and the Shepherd Islands (as well as Erromango Island with vaccine delivery), and Wingcopter Holding GmbH & Co. KG of Darmstadt, Germany, to deliver vaccines to facilities on Pentecost Island. Both companies use VTOL type aeroplanes that can take off and land without specialist equipment or runways. In December 2018, Kroger began delivering groceries to customers in the Scottsdale, Arizona, area using unmanned vehicles designed by Nuro. Also in December 2018 BBC reported Canada's Moose Cree First Nation had signed a commercial contract with Drone Delivery Canada (DDC) in order to have \\"supplies, medicine, food and mail\\" delivered to a part of the country that is every year for some time only accessible by helicopter.  2019  In January 2019, Amazon announced its new delivery system, the Amazon Scout. Postmates began delivering food in Los Angeles in 2019 with a delivery robot named Serve. Amazon decided to use drones to speed up the shipping service so that it can save time. The goal for Amazon is to deliver packages to customers within 30 minutes.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/22/amazon- issued-patent-for-delivery-drones-that-can-react-to-screaming-flailing-arms/ The Amazon drones are fully controlled by computers and they access GPS to deliver objects. Amazon started discussing this topic in 2013 and they have been testing it, but they are still working to demonstrate a safe operation. By February 2019, Zipline International has delivered over 10,000 packages in Rwanda. The company now runs two distribution centers (one in Muhanga and another in Kayonza, Eastern of Rwanda), where they plan to scale up to essential emergency medicines all over the country. On 19 April 2019, a drone has flown from Saint Agnes Hospital to the University of Maryland Medical Center of Baltimore, delivering a kidney that has been successfully transplanted into a 44-year-old woman. In August 2019, Swoop Aero set up the first drone port in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and received approvals to deliver medical supplies and vaccines, as well as to transport time-sensitive test samples in the Province of Equateur. The project is being run in partnership with GAVI, VillageReach, and the DRC Ministry of Health, and will continue in 2020. Illegal deliveries Drug cartels have used UAVs to transport contraband, sometimes using GPS-guided UAVs. From 2013 and 2015, UAVs were observed delivering items into prisons on at least four occasions in the United States while four separate but similar incidents occurred in Ireland, Britain, Australia and Canada as well. Though not a popular way of smuggling items into prisons, corrections officials state that some individuals are beginning to experiment with UAVs. In November 2013, four people in Morgan, Georgia, were arrested for allegedly attempting to smuggle contraband into Calhoun State Prison with a hexacopter. In 2014 a quadcopter crashed into an exercise yard of Wheatfield Prison, Dublin. The quadcopter collided with wires designed to prevent helicopters landing to aid escapes, causing it to crash. A package containing drugs hung from the quadcopter and was seized by prisoners before prison staff could get to it. Between 2014 and 2015, at two prisons in South Carolina, items such as drugs and cell phones were flown into the area by UAVs with authorities and one prison not knowing how many deliveries were successful before gaining the attention of authorities.  Mechanical System  A common configuration of a delivery drone is an octocopter, which is a drone that carries 8 motors. This provides enough power for the drone and good balance with respect to its weight. There are many sensors in the drone which are necessary for it to fly correctly. Tilt sensors such as an accelerometer help the drone remain in flight by making small adjustments to the motor thrust to allow it to recover from air currents or extreme maneuvers. Navigation sensors such as a GPS or magnetic sensors aid in the navigation of the drone by measuring the drone's location and orientation with respect to the ground. These sensors are also necessary for the drone to fly to the correct destination to drop off the object it is delivering. Airflow sensors allow drones to detect change in air temperature, air speed, or wind currents, and that information balances the circuits to make the drone's flight more stable. Delivery drones need powerful motors which are necessary for the drone to fly effectively. Brushless DC motors are used in drones because they are cheap, lightweight, powerful, and small. The rotor blades of the drone turn at very high speeds, so the optimal material used for these rotor blades maximizes the strength to weight ratio. Some are made from carbon-fiber reinforced composites while others are made of thermoplastics because they are cheaper so the cost of replacement when the drone crashes is smaller. Lithium ion batteries are used in most drones because they offer enough energy and power, and they are relatively light so they do not weigh down the drone too much See also * Automated storage and retrieval system References Unmanned aerial vehicles Emerging technologies Freight transport Flying robots ","title":"Delivery drone"},{"id":"41253343","text":"Bashmaq (, also Romanized as BƒÅshmƒÅq) is a village in Yeylan-e Jonubi Rural District, Bolbanabad District, Dehgolan County, Kurdistan Province, Iran.

Investigators determined the cause of the accident to be pilot negligence. Background The crew of the Tu-134A aircraft, serial number 62327 manufactured on 28 June 1979, consisted of pilot in command Alexander Kliuyev, co-pilot Gennady Zhirnov, navigating officer Ivan Mokhonko, flight engineer Kyuri Khamzatov and three flight attendants. Having departed from Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg (then Sverdlovsk) and bound for Grozny, Flight 6502 had one stopover in Kurumoch Airport of Samara (then Kuibyshev). Crash While approaching Kurumoch Airport, Kliuyev made a bet with Zhirnov that he, Kliuyev, could make an instrument-only approach with curtained cockpit windows, thus having no visual contact with the ground, instead of an NDB approach, suggested by the air traffic control. Kliuyev further ignored the ground proximity warning at an altitude of and did not make the suggested go- around. The aircraft touched down at a speed of and came to rest upside down. Sixty-three people died during the accident and seven more in hospitals later. Among the passengers were fourteen children, all of whom survived the accident. The top secret report of the Chairman of Kuibyshev oblispolkom V.A. Pogodin to the Premier of the Soviet Union, Nikolai Ryzhkov, gave slightly different figures: 85 passengers and 8 crew members aboard, 53 passengers and five crew members died in the crash and 11 more in hospital later. Even though Zhirnov made no attempt to avert the crash, he subsequently tried to save the passengers and died of cardiac arrest en route to hospital. Kliuyev was prosecuted and sentenced to fifteen years in prison, later reduced to six years served.

It is one of the two initiatives taken by the government to ease travel within the congested city; the other being the Dar es Salaam bus rapid transit system. Services are provided by the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) and Tanzania Railways Limited (TRL). History Background Prior to its launch, the Dala dala was the only major means of intracity public transport. Launch The inaugural journey commenced on 29 October 2012. The public affectionately refer to it as Treni ya Mwakyembe in honour of Harrison Mwakyembe, the Transport Minister at the time. The Citizen reported in January 2013 that 'Zambia was opposed' to the project utilising the TAZARA track and that it wasn't 'properly consulted'. Zambian officials insisted that the matter ought to have been brought before the board of directors for approval as both the governments are equal shareholders. Minister Mwakyembe refuted these allegations saying all procedures were adhered to. An anonymous TAZARA board member commented that they had failed to convene their quarterly meeting for the past six months. The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport presented an award to Mwakyembe in December 2013 for introducing this service. The TRL Line launched on 1 August 2016, plying the airport route 3 times in the morning from 6 am and 3 times in the evening from 15.55 hours. Routes TRL line Tanzania Railways () operates a 20 km track from Pugu Station to the city centre via Gongo la Mboto, FFU mombasa, Banana, Karakata(Airport), Vingunguti Mbuzi, SS Bakhresa, Kamata(Kariakoo City BRT station) then finally Central. TAZARA line TAZARA () offers two routes on its 20.5 km rail network. The first from its station in Dar es Salaam to Mwakanga which lies on the outskirts of the city. It stops at Kwa Fundi Umeme, Kwa Limboa, Lumo Kigilagila, Sigara, Kitunda road, Kipunguni B, Majohe and Magnus. The second service runs from its Dar es Salaam station to Kurasini via Kwa Fundi Umeme, Yombo, Chimwaga, Maputo, Mtoni Relini and Kwa Aziz Ali Relini. Operations The service is available during the morning and evening rush hours throughout the week (excluding Sundays and public holidays). Ticket pricing TRL and TAZARA had proposed a fare of Tsh 800 (US$ 0.50) and 700 respectively for a single journey. However, the Surface and Marine Transportation Regulatory Authority (Sumatra) capped the adult fares at Tsh 600 (US$ 0.27) and 500 whilst students are charged Tsh 100 (US$ 0.07). Finance In May 2013, TAZARA line reported an increase in revenue from Tsh 40 to 50 million. As of November 2013, the TRL line has been operating at a loss. It costs Tsh 4 million per day to run this segment whereas revenue stands at Tsh 2 million. The high operating cost has been attributed to the engines and wagons which aren't cost efficient for short journeys. Future expansion RAHCO, the holding company of TRL, issued a tender in September 2013 inviting bids for feasibility studies and the design of new railway lines from its central station to four destinations: Luguruni (Morogoro Road), Chamazi (Kilwa Road), Pugu (via Julius Nyerere International Airport) and Kerenge.

Her students called her AK. Personal life As a girl in rural Wisconsin she found a copy of Hamlet (one source says Doll's House), and was smitten with a love of dramatic literature, even though an older sister teased her for mispronouncing many of the words. As a high school senior, she dismissed her first marriage proposal, vowing to seek a career. After a stint at University of Wisconsin, she found her way to Evanston. In her first year at the Cumnock school she was thrilled and intimated when its founder (later professor at Northwestern) addressed the new class. Miss Krause's life partner was her former student, Lucy McCammon (August 12, 1898-December 19, 1991), born to a family prominent in Springfield, Missouri. Lucy McCammon taught physical education at Bloomsburg State College (1926-1958). From 1971, the two women shared a house in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Professional life After high school, she attended the Cumnock Oratorical School, 1914-1916. After graduation, she taught elocution and girls' athletics in high schools in Colorado and Springfield, Missouri. She returned to Northwestern, earning a bachelor's degree in 1928. She taught drama and English at a high school in Seaside, Oregon, where some of her family lived. She coached the girls' basketball team to a state championship. She taught drama for a year at Hamline University in St. Paul. Her student group from Hamline performed so well at a drama festival in Evanston, that Northwestern hired her. In 1930, Northwestern appointed her an Instructor of Voice and Interpretation in the School of Speech. She earned a master's degree there in 1933; her master's thesis (A Study of Creative Imagination) purported to describe the creative process scientifically. Her principal duties were giving private lessons in voice and interpretation. Budget considerations led the School of Speech to discontinue private instruction in the early 1940s. She was appointed assistant professor in 1941, and developed a one-year course in acting. She expanded this to a three-year acting program, developing an approach still used at Northwestern and emulated elsewhere. In 1957 she was appointed Associate Professor. Miss Krause was the artistic director and driving force for summer theater at Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania, for twenty years from 1945 producing 178 plays by Chekhov, Ibsen, Moli√®re, Rostand, Shakespeare, and Shaw. It drew scouts from movie studios and the professional stage. Over spring break in 1945, she and Miss McCammon (who taught physical education at nearby Bloomsburg State Teachers College) leased the Forest Inn Playhouse. (Ethel Barrymore's daughter Ethel Barrymore Colt had performed there.) Each summer, AK invited some of her Northwestern acting students to Eagles Mere. She herself acted in two productions. The students acted and produced the plays, sewed costumes, sold tickets door to door, cooked, cleaned, and controlled the bat and mouse population. They featured performers such as Patricia Neal, Jimmy Gheen, Charlton Heston, Jennifer Jones, Paula Prentiss, and Richard Benjamin. The legacy remained in a nationally recognized summer drama workshop Dewire Community Center, as of 1993. (master's thesis) Northwestern forced her to retire in 1961, but in the face of alumni protest they let her stay on for two years as a part-time lecturer. In 1963 she retired as professor emeritus. She founded a repertory company at Chicago's Harper Theatre in 1966. It achieved critical acclaim in its first season (for Six Characters in Search of an Author, The Physicists, Too True To Be Good), but failed. She enjoyed great popularity even in retirement, and students engaged her for private instruction. She conducted master classes as late as 1976 and 1977. She had moved to Bloomsburg in 1971, and some of her former master class students founded the Bloomsburg Theater Ensemble in 1978. They engaged the 83-year-old Krause as artistic advisor, and later artistic director. In the summer of 1981 she directed Lady Audley's Secret, a 19th- century play, there.

The demonstration took place on June 23, 1957 when a group of African American protesters, led by Reverend Douglas E. Moore, entered the Royal Ice Cream Parlor and sat in the section reserved for white patrons.\\"Negroes Fined In Dairy Bar Case,\\" The Durham Morning Herald, June 24, 1957. When asked to move, the protesters refused and were arrested for trespassing. The case was appealed unsuccessfully to the County and State Superior Courts.\\"Ice Cream Bar Case: Six Get Stiffer Rap on Appeal,\\" The Carolina Times, July 20, 1957, 1.'Jose Stuntz, \\"White Jury Selected To Try ‚ÄòWhite Side‚Äô Ice Cream Case,\\" The Durham Morning Herald, July 17, 1957.\\"Negroes Lose In Trespass Case Appeal,\\" the Durham Morning Herald, January 11, 1958. The sit-in sparked debates within the African American communities in Durham about the strategies of civil rights activism. It also helped to spark future protests such as the Greensboro sit-ins and to promote coordination among African American civil rights activists across the Southeast.  Historical context  In 1896, the United States Supreme Court decision Plessy v. Ferguson upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation of public facilities under the doctrine of \\"separate but equal\\". The separation in practice led to inferior conditions for African Americans, especially in the Southern states. Meanwhile, Durham had a reputation throughout the South as a \\"unique town‚Ä¶ that is more liberal than what you would expect in a Southern state,\\" according to Durham native and civil rights leader Pauli Murray. In Durham, racial conflicts were arguably less severe than in other Southern towns and African Americans enjoyed more opportunities, including in the city's many tobacco plants. Prominent leaders established their own businesses and developed a prosperous black neighborhood called \\"Hayti\\", which had its own store, theaters, restaurants and hospital. However, as in much of the South, Jim Crow laws were still rooted in Durham, with segregation resulting in inferior facilities and housing, fewer employment opportunities for African Americans. Separated by the city's railroad tracks, black and white neighborhoods contrasted greatly in standards of living.NCMCC, North Carolina and the Negro (North Carolina Mayors' Co-operating Committee, 1964), 71  Events and sentiments leading to the sit-in  In Durham, the struggle to end racial segregation was spurred by the creation of the DCNA (Durham Committee on Negro Affairs) in 1935.Oral History Interview with Conrad Odell Pearson, April 18, 1979. Interview H-0218. Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) in the Southern Oral History Program Collection, Southern Historical Collection, Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. During the 1930s and 1940s, the DCNA helped raise the number of blacks registered to vote.\\"Durham's Civil Rights Heritage: Durham Committee on Negro Affairs\\", The Herald-Sun, March 9, 2013 It also worked to increase job opportunities for blacks and to promote black candidates for elected and appointed positions in Durham. However, after World War II, much of the progress in blacks' professional advancement was reversed, and many from the young generation were forced back into lower-wage positions. At the same time, this younger generation was also becoming dissatisfied with the DCNA's mild, pacifistic approach to the problem of segregation in Durham. A week before the sit-in, Louis E. Austin, editor of Durham's African American newspaper Carolina Times and a supporter of Moore's, wrote: \\"This newspaper senses a stagnation that is beginning to creep over the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs which, if allowed to continue, is certain to spell its doom‚Ä¶. The DCNA is becoming too high-brow, too soft and too compromising.\\" Austin continued in this editorial to call for \\"new blood, new faces and new ideas\\". Rev. Douglas E. Moore, a pastor at the Asbury Temple United Methodists Church, had been active in the desegregation movement in Durham during the 1950s. Prior to the sit-in, he had petitioned the City Council for an end to segregation at Durham Public Library and the Carolina Theater. On June 13, 1957, he and his family attempted to gain admission to the all-white Long Meadow Park swimming pool. When they were denied, he immediately appealed unsuccessfully to city recreation officers.  Role of the Black Church  Rev. Moore studied Theology at Boston University, where he was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr. In an October 3, 1956 letter to King, Moore proposed that \\"[a] regional group which uses the power of nonviolence would help give us direction on national movements\\". Like other religious leaders of the era, Moore recognized the central role of the church within black communities, particularly in organizing political movements. Sociologist Aldon Morris has supported this view of the church in relation to community-building, stating: \\"The church was functioning as the institutional vanguard of a mass based black movement\\". Long before the Royal Ice Cream Sit-in, community leaders such as Moore began to form alliances in order to promote a national movement. Using the church as an organizational base, they started to train young activists to be \\"professional\\" non-violent protesters. This practice was later noted by one of Moore's activist compatriots, Gordon Carey, who stated: \\"‚Ä¶When we reached these cities we went directly to the movement oriented churches.\\" According to Carey, these churches were selected because they were \\"where the protest activities were being planned and organized.\\" In 1957 the organizers of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) sent out a call to fellow clergymen of the South to organize their congregations and local communities for collective protest. Around this time, Rev. Moore was rallying a group of young activists called \\"ACT\\", which included the Royal Ice Cream Sit-in participants. They met Sunday afternoons at Asbury Temple United Methodist Church, where Moore served as pastor, to talk about how to \\"push the envelope of Jim Crow‚Äôs Law.\\"  Sit-in and trial  At approximately 6:45PM on June 23, 1957, Rev. Moore led seven attendees from his Sunday session at Ashbury United into the segregated Royal Ice Cream Parlor, located nearby at the corner of Roxboro and Dowd Streets (1000 N. Roxboro Street). The group entered through the back door, sat in the section reserved for white patrons, and asked to be served. When busboy David Champion asked the group to move to the section reserved for black patrons, Moore asked to speak to the manager. The owner, Louis Coletta, then appeared and asked the group to either move to the other section or to leave; when the group refused, Coletta called the police. One member of the group left the premises before the police arrived. Police Lieutenant Wallace Upchurch led several officers in the arrest of the remaining seven. Now known as \\"the Royal Seven,\\" the group included Mary Elizabeth Clyburn, Vivian Jones, Virginia Williams, Claude Glenn, Jesse W. Gray, and Melvin Willis, in addition to Rev. Moore.\\"Color Line Cracking Attempt Nets Fines,\\" The Durham Morning Herald, June 25, 1957. At the Durham Recorder's Court the following day, the protesters were convicted of trespassing and fined 10 dollars each plus court costs. They were represented by William A.(\\"Billy\\") Marsh Jr., a Durham Civil Rights attorney. They immediately appealed the case to the Durham County Superior Court. On July 16, 1957, after a 24-minute deliberation, the all-white jury of the Superior Court upheld the guilty verdict and fined the protesters an additional 25 dollars each. The case moved up to the State Supreme Court, where the protesters again lost their case on January 10, 1958. Associate Justice William B. Rodman said the 14th Amendment prohibits discriminatory actions by states but \\"erects no shield against merely private conduct, however, discriminatory or wrongful.\\" The group then appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear their case. In a 1957 interview, Moore maintained that the sit-in had not been a planned protest, stating: \\"we went to the ice cream parlor for ice cream, nothing else.\\" However, a later source indicates that Moore may have deliberately chosen Royal Ice Cream as a protest venue because of its location in a predominantly black neighborhood; this source quotes him thusly: \\"I thought I could isolate them in the black community.\\"Naomi Kaufman, \\"Durham Sit-in Helped Change Racial Patterns,\\" Daily Independent, 16 December 1979, 6E. Sparked by the Royal Ice Cream incident, local protests continued in and around Durham for years, mainly led and inspired by Rev. Moore and Floyd McKissick, a black attorney and prominent community leader. They also began a six-year struggle to integrate the parlor. This struggle culminated in 1963, when Coletta sold the business and Royal Ice Cream became integrated.  Short-term impacts  This first attempt at desegregation provoked a controversy within the black community in Durham, because the young activists threatened the delicate balance that had been cautiously maintained by the leadership of DCNA. Other well-established organizations such as Durham's black Ministerial Alliance and the Durham NAACP also criticized Moore's \\"radical\\" efforts. At that time, the local NAACP was still fighting for a prolonged legal struggle against Durham's school segregation, and worried that losing the case might set a dangerous legal precedent and also divert the organization's energy. In brief, the more experienced black leaders in Durham viewed the sit-in as a premature and risky act led by a radical, young outsider. Despite all these initial doubts, the 1957 sit-in sparked within the Durham black community a serious debate on strategies for future protests. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs‚Äô Economic Committee, headed by Floyd McKissick and Nathaniel White Sr., discussed whether to launch a boycott of the ice cream parlor. However, several committee members questioned the approach, because the owner of Royal Ice Cream Parlor, Louis Coletta, was an Italian Immigrant. Even Rev. Moore himself, who supported the boycott proposal, admitted that Coletta was \\"a member of a minority group\\" and that his parlor might not be the ideal target.Douglas Moore, interviewed by anonymous, Duke University Oral History Program Collection, January 28, 1978. Although DCNA and other organizations did not back up the protesters, the sit- in did prompt them to reevaluate their roles in dismantling Jim Crow. It also encouraged community-wide black boycotts and direct actions, which were forerunners of later collective movements. This unsuccessful attempt did inspire a surge of youth enthusiasm, as black students continued to carry out the most active protests and challenge the conservatism of Durham's elder and privileged African American circles. A group of high school NAACP members, more than half of them girls, organized regular pickets outside the Royal Ice Cream Parlor, under the direction of Floyd McKissick. The students refused to place their hopes in the protracted process of seeking justice in the courts. Nor did they trust the slow and quiet diplomacy adopted by the black elites. The Royal Ice Cream Sit-in spread the idea of direct action among Durham's black students. Though it did not immediately initiate subversion, the sit-in encouraged a mass of students to take initiatives in concrete actions, and these sentiments paved road for future movements. The continuation of the sit- ins and other forms of non-violent resistance eventually succeeded. In 1960, the Mayor's Committee on Human Relations revealed a planned program for desegregation of Durham lunch counters and Durham officially became the seventh town in North Carolina to integrate its lunch counter service.\\"Durham Counters Integrated,\\" High Point Enterprise, August 2, 1960. Desegregation was effected starting on a limited basis, and mass demonstrations by Durham blacks continued to 1963 when public facilities were finally desegregated.  Long- term significance  The sit-in had significant influence on the strategies used by civil rights activists in the Southeast during the 1960s. It revealed the shortcomings of unpublicized, spur-of-the-moment protests and also highlighted the challenges faced by black protestors in the legal and media contexts of the time. For the Royal Seven, these challenges included the all- white Superior Court jury and the sparse journalistic coverage.Jose Stuntz, \\"‚ÄôIce Cream Parlor‚Äô Negroes Found Guilty Of Trespassing,\\" the Durham Morning Herald, July 18, 1958. While the Durham Morning Herald featured the sit-in on the front page, the story was buried inside the Raleigh News and Observer and did not appear at all in the Carolina Times until a month later. There was little coverage of the sit-in on a national scale. The sit-in also encouraged leaders to organize \\"local movement centers\\" that encouraged coordination among civil rights activists across the Southeast. As noted above, local activists like Moore had been developing \\"direct action\\" organizations throughout the South during the 1950s. But since the Royal Ice Cream Sit-in, Moore realized the importance of alliances between these black \\"movement centers\\" in the South. Moore and McKissick began planning a nationwide sit-in movement that would start from Durham. During that time, they contacted activists in other \\"movement centers\\" throughout North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, urging them to train students for sit-ins. After the Greensboro sit-ins, activists contacted their counterparts in other cities, assessing their readiness for action; for example, on February 3, 1960, Moore spoke with Nashville civil rights activist James M. Lawson, urging him to speed his efforts toward the desegregation of Woolworth. That spring, sit-ins took place across the Southern states. In 1960, Moore famously attested to the seriousness of the sit-in movement with the statement: \\"If Woolworth and other stores think that this is just another panty raid, they haven‚Äôt had their sociologists in the field recently.\\"\\"New Trespass Laws Strongly Protested,\\" The Journal and Guide, March 5, 1960.  Commemoration and memory  The Royal Ice Cream Sit-in was largely overshadowed by the later Greensboro sit-ins, the latter of which were generally regarded as the nation's first sit-ins.Jim Wise, \\"Sit-in made civil rights history: The incident at a Durham ice cream parlor was one of the South's first but gets scant attention in accounts of the era,\\" Tribune Business News, June 23, 2007. In 1979, a debate developed around whether a commemorative marker of the first sit-in belonged in Durham or Greensboro; Blackwell M. \\"Dog\\" Brogden, one of the prosecutors from the 1957 Recorder's Court case, stated to the press that the marker belonged in Durham.Al Wheless, \\"Lawyer: Durham 1st In Sit-Ins For Rights,\\" the Durham Morning Herald, December 5, 1979. Starting in 1979, at least four unsuccessful attempts were made to create a marker at the Royal Ice Cream Parlor site. Initially, North Carolina's Highway Historic Marker Committee maintained that the Royal Ice Cream Sit-in \\"did not have enough significance.\\" Durham citizens, however, felt that the event was central to the city's civil rights history.\\"Recognize Durham sit-in,\\" Tribune Business News, November 23, 2007 In 2007, the NC Highway Historic Marker Committee reversed its previous position, acknowledging the importance of the Sit-in, and approving a commemorative marker.North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program, North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?MarkerId=G-123 That year, a marker was placed at the site with the inscription: \\"ROYAL ICE CREAM SIT-IN: Segregation protest at an ice cream parlor on this site, June 23, 1957, led to court case testing dual racial facilities.\\" See also * Sit-in movement - list of sit- in's References Bibliography   Civil rights protests in the United States Civil disobedience History of Durham, North Carolina 1957 in North Carolina Ice cream parlors 1957 protests ","title":"Royal Ice Cream sit-in"},{"id":"41253697","text":"Saedabad () may refer to: * Saedabad, Dehgolan * Saedabad, Kamyaran ","title":"Saedabad"},{"id":"41253704","text":"Tazehabad (, also Romanized as TƒÅzehƒÅbƒÅd; also known as Kanƒ´ GolzƒÅr, KƒÅnƒ´-ye GolzƒÅr, TƒÅzehƒÅbƒÅd-e KƒÅnƒ´ GolzƒÅr, and TƒÅzehƒÅbƒÅd-e QarƒÅ Gowl) is a village in Quri Chay Rural District, in the Central District of Dehgolan County, Kurdistan Province, Iran.

The wood frame house was built in 1846, and is a representative of housing of the African American community in Dalton in the 19th century. Now owned by the town and restored, the property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history The Fitch‚ÄìHoose House stands on the northern fringe of the village of Dalton, in an area called The Gulf that was known to be settled by freed or escaped African Americans in the early 19th century. It is a small 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, brick chimney on one end, and clapboarded exterior. The ground floor of the main facade is three bays wide, with a slightly off-center entrance flanked by sash windows. The attic story is taller than often seen in mid-19th century houses, and is presently devoid of windows; surviving window openings have been covered by modern siding. A shed-roof ell extends to the rear; its roof is at a different pitch than that of the main roof, and the two are not joined. The house was built in 1848 by William Bogart, and immediately sold to Henry Fitch, a local African American. After a succession of owners, including local papermaking magnate Zenas M. Crane (who had acquired and foreclosed on Henry Fitch's mortgage), the property was purchased in 1868 by Charles Hoose, member of an African American family that had been resident in Dalton since at least 1830. The Hoose family occupied the house until 2001. The property then fell vacant, was taken by the town through tax foreclosure proceedings in 2004. Since then it has been the focus of restoration work by the local historic commission.

Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66 (2013), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court dealing with the justiciability doctrine of mootness.. Background The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) provides that all employees have the right to full pay for forty hours of work in any given week. Laura Symczyk, a nurse working for Genesis HealthCare, alleged that her employer would regularly dock thirty minutes of pay per shift for its employees as meal time, regardless of whether the employee actually took a meal break. Under the FLSA, an aggrieved employee can sue not only on her own behalf, but on behalf of all co-workers who have similarly been injured. This is called a \\"collective action,\\" which is roughly (but not completely) similar to a class action. Symczyk filed a collective action suit under the FLSA, and her employer thereafter offered her $7,500 in unpaid wages plus attorneys fees and other costs and expenses, which would have fully satisfied her individual claim. After she failed to respond to the offer, Genesis moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that through her failure to accept satisfaction, in full, of her claim for relief, she no longer had any interest in the litigation. Symczyk argued that her employer was simply attempting a \\"pick off\\" - by satisfying her claim, Genesis could avoid facing the collective action suit on behalf of the other employees. The district court found that because no other employees had joined the collective action and because Symczyk had been offered full relief, her claim was moot. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed that Symczyk's personal claim was moot, but authorized her to proceed with the collective action. Decision In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that the entire action must be dismissed based on an assumption of mootness. The majority did not actually settle the mootness issue, claiming that the issue was not properly before the Court because Symczyk failed to file her own appeal on the point and had waived the issue in the proceedings below. The majority held that a collective action suit cannot survive once the individual claim is satisfied without other workers coming forward to take part. Because Symczyk failed to contest that the offer from Genesis mooted the claim, and because no other workers had joined the collective action, the entire action was moot. The dissent emphasized that this case is largely meaningless in the grand scheme of things because this situation would likely never recur in another case. The dissent attacked the majority's assumption that the offer of satisfaction mooted the claim, and the dissenters further argued that when such an offer is simply unaccepted (as was the case here) the case can continue to move forward.
