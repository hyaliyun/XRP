He received the Kenneth E. Boulding Memorial Award in 2006 for recognition of advancements in research combining social theory and the natural sciences. He is considered one of the founders of and a continuing leader in the field of ecological economics.\\"Who will get rich on oil from sea?: Bidding system for offshore leases criticized for favoring major firms On the auction block: 'Not good news' OFFSHORE OIL: America's trillion-dollar decision Limited drilling Changes possible Pace of leasing An even break,\\" The Christian Science Monitor, John Dillin, April 18, 1974.  Personal life  Norgaard was born on August 18, 1943 in Washington D. C.,http://erg.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/Richard_Norgaard/CV_March_11.pdf and raised in Montclair, an East Bay neighborhood in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. At an early age, he was interested in white water rafting, and was introduced to the sport by a friend, whose father, Lou Elliott, worked for the Sierra Club coordinating river trips. When he was 15 Norgaard started working for H.A.T.C.H River Expeditions as a pot washer, and was based in Vernal, Utah near the confluence of the Green River (Colorado River) and Yampa Rivers. Norgaard continued in the business of white water rafting, quickly becoming a head boatman, and bounced around many guiding companies including one that Lou Elliott eventually founded after his career at The Sierra Club. His commitment to and involvement in the environmental movement began when he served as a river guide to David Brower, then Executive Director of the Sierra Club, for the Glen Canyon stretch of the Colorado River in the early 1960s.Norgaard, Richard. \\"Trandisciplinary Shared Learning\\" in Sustainability on Campus. Peggy Bartlett and Geoffrey Chase. (eds). MIT Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts. 2004. Norgaard also worked shortly as a professional photographer prior to his career in academics. Since 2004, following the election of George W. Bush to a second term, Norgaard has been seen wearing only black colored attire, a silent yet visible protest against the folly of American electorate and the rise of anti-government, market fundamentalism, and \\"know-nothingism\\". He has four children and is married to Nancy A. Rader,http://energycenter.org/index.php/outreach-a-education/annual- events/sustainable-energy-week/speakers-bio/2271-nancy-rader the Executive Director of the California Wind Energy Association (CALWEA). Norgaard continues river rafting every summer with his family.  Academic career  Norgaard received his B.A. in economics from University of California, Berkeley, a M.S. in agricultural economics from Oregon State University, and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 1971. That same year, at the age of 27, he was an advisor for President Richard Nixon as part of the President‚Äôs Council on Environmental Quality. During the 1970s Dr. Norgaard was one of the nation's leading experts on the leasing of petroleum rights, especially on the outer continental shelf, as well as a leading expert on the economics of pesticide use and biological control of pests. He published an influential paper in 1975 that showed that farmers who hired an independent pest-control expert had higher profits and used half as much pesticide as those who relied on the advice of agribusiness representatives. Dr. Norgaard became a Professor at U.C. Berkeley at the age of 27 in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics. Thereafter he helped found the field of Ecological Economics, and also helped initiate the interdisciplinary Energy and Resources Group at U.C. Berkeley as a graduate program in the early 1970s; he was later fully integrated as a member of its core faculty in the 1980s. He was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley for over 40 years before his retirement in 2013, most recently having taught courses in ecological economics; history of economics; and the history, science, and politics of California's water. His field experience was primarily in Alaska, Brazil, California, and Vietnam with minor forays in other parts of the globe. Dr. Norgaard is the author of one book, co-author or editor of three additional books, and has over 100 other publications spanning the fields of environment and development, tropical forestry and agriculture, environmental epistemology, energy economics, and ecological economics. Although his research scholarship has been an eclectic mix of sociology, economics, philosophy, and the natural sciences, and he is well known for his iconoclast perspectives of conventional economics, stemming from a strong commitment to inter-disciplinarity and social justice, Professor Norgaard is also among the 1000 economists in the world most cited by other economists (Millennium Editions of Who's Who in Economics, 2000) and was one of ten American economists interviewed in The Changing Face of Economics: Conversations with Cutting Edge Economists (Colander, Holt, and Rosser, University of Michigan Press, 2004). He is frequently recognized within the field of economics (Who‚Äôs Who in Economics, Millennium Edition, and The Changing Face of Economics: Conversations with Cutting Edge Economists 2004) and the field of ecological economics (Kenneth E. Boulding Award, 2006) for both his critiques of and contributions to economics even while he has dedicated most of his time working across disciplinary ways of understanding. The American Association for the Advancement of Science elected Norgaard to the status of ‚ÄúFellow‚Äù in 2007. His research emphasizes how the resolution of complex socio- environmental problems challenges modern beliefs about science and policy and explores development as a process of coevolution between social and environmental systems. His writing is informed through work on energy, environment, and development issues around the globe with different periods of his efforts emphasizing Alaska, Brazil, and California. Norgaard is a lead author of the 5th Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and serves on the International Panel on Sustainable Resource Management of the United Nations Environment Programme. In 2006, Norgaard was awarded the Kenneth Boulding Memorial Award for \\"expanding transdisciplinary approaches to knowledge, promoting pluralism, and forging a coevolutionary approach to economy, society, and the environment in the spirit of the open and inquisitive mind that was the hallmark of Boulding's work.\\" He was selected as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007. Norgaard also is continuing to lead the Bay Delta Conservation Plan of the Independent Science Board of CALFED (California Bay-Delta Authority). Norgaard serves on the Board of Directors of the New Economics Institute, on scientific advisory boards to Tsinghua and Beijing Normal University, and on the Board of EcoEquity. He has also served on the Board of Directors of the American Institute of Biological Sciences (2000-2009), in the position of Treasurer (2003-2009. He served as President of the International Society for Ecological Economics (1998-2001). He served as the founding Chair of the Board of Redefining Progress (1994‚Äì97) and as a member of its board until 2007. Professor Norgaard was a Project Specialist with the Ford Foundation in Brazil (1978 and 1979), a visiting research fellow at the World Bank (1992). Norgaard also has previously served on the Science Advisory Board of the U.S. EPA (2000-2004), as a member of the U.S. committee of the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE), and on numerous panels of the National Research Council and the former Office of Technology Assessment.

The right inset is an electron diffraction pattern confirming the hexagonal structure. Stanene is a 2D material and a 2D topological insulator. It is composed of tin atoms arranged in a single, hexagonal layer, in a manner similar to graphene. Its name combines stannum (the Latin name for tin) with the suffix -ene used by graphene. Stanene was theoretically predicted to be a 2D topological insulator in 2011, and its functionalized derivations as topological insulators were predicted in 2013. Both may display dissipationless superconductive currents at their edges near room temperature. The addition of fluorine atoms to the tin lattice could extend the operating temperature up to 100 ¬∞C. This would make it practical for use in integrated circuits to make smaller, faster and more energy efficient computers. Synthesis The synthesis and study of optical properties of stanene was first claimed by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Stanene synthesis was reported by a second group in 2015, using molecular beam epitaxy on a substrate of bismuth telluride. Theoretical research suggested Ag(111) surface may be a good substrate to grow stanene epitaxially. In 2018 the growth of epitaxial 2D stanene on an Ag(111) single crystal template was reported. Reactivity First principle calculations have predicted that stanene is very reactive against common air pollutants such as NOx and COx and is able to trap and dissociate them at low temperatures.

History The club was established by Ngungunyane Matsenjwa, with an aim of bringing together youths of Moneni township in the outskirts of Manzini. Prior to the club being taken over by Matsenjwa, it was known as The Blue Birds Football Club. In 1967, the club's name changed to Moneni Pirates FC, inspired by Soweto giants, Orlando Pirates. A lot of clubs in Eswatini are named after popular clubs in South Africa. This is because Swazi football fans follow clubs in South Africa, and the local clubs look to export talent to the more professional Premier Soccer League. The club has been relegated from the highest league in then-Swaziland three times in its history ‚Äì in the 1998‚Äì1999, the 2005‚Äì06 seasons and the 2014‚Äì15 season. It quickly regained promotion in the elite league on all three occasions of relegation, with the latest happening through a 2nd position finish in the National First Division in the 2016/16 season. It finished the first round of the 2016/17 season in a mid-table position of the Premier League, after it finished the round strongly following a slow start in the league. In the current season, 2019/20 season, the club has been a revalation, resulting in football pundits comparing it to its yesteryears. At the time of COVID-19 lockdown, the Club was placed in position 4 of the MTN League, with a fighting shot to finish 2nd. Time will tell on whether the League will result and finish.

It is the fourth in a series of independent documentaries that Tsuchimoto made of the mercury poisoning incident in Minamata, Japan. Film content Four years after Minamata: The Victims and Their World, Tsuchimoto's camera focuses on the everyday lives of the victims of mercury poisoning. Fisherman still knowingly catch and eat the mercury-laden fish caught in the beautiful Shiranui Sea because that is what they have always done and that is how they relate to nature. Some patients who received significant compensation from Chisso, the polluter, may now live in good houses, but without doing work their lives seem somehow empty. The real victims remain the children, who are now getting older and in some cases increasingly conscious of the fact they are different from other children. Reception The film scholar Justin Jesty wrote that The Shiranui Sea is \\"the crowning achievement of Tsuchimoto's first five years of engagement with mercury poisoning. The film is a long and powerful meditation on the depth and breadth of the tragedy.\\" The documentarist Makoto Sat≈ç called The Shiranui Sea \\"the ultimate masterpiece\\" of Tsuchimoto's Minamata films; and the filmmaker John Gianvito selected it as one of the ten best films of all time in the 2012 Sight and Sound poll.

He was drafted by the New York Giants in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft. He played college football at Colorado State.  High school career  A native of Bushland, Texas, Richburg attended Bushland High School, where he was a two- sport star in football and track. In football, he was a two-way lineman and team captain. As a senior, he recorded two sacks as a defensive lineman, but earned first-team all-district honors on the offensive line. The Bushland Falcons went undefeated (10‚Äì0) through the regular season, but lost in the first round of the UIL 2A Division I playoffs to eventual state champion Muleshoe. Richburg also competed in track & field at Bushland as a thrower. He captured the state title in the shot put event at the 2009 UIL T&F; Championships, with a PR throw of 18.34 meters (60 ft 1 in), setting a school record, that ranks as the fourth-best throw by a Texas prep athlete in any classification and worthy of the Texas Class 2A gold medal. In the discus, he got a top-throw of 53.31 meters (172 ft 2 in) at the 2009 Texas Tech Regional Qualifiers, where he took bronze. He also competed as a hurdler earlier in high school. Regarded as a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Richburg was not ranked among the best offensive lineman of the class of 2009, which also included D. J. Fluker and Taylor Lewan.Rivals.com offensive tackles 2009 He chose Colorado State over Texas Christian, the only other scholarship offer he received. https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Weston- Richburg-90946  College career  In the beginning of his senior season at Colorado State, Richburg was graded at greater than 90 percent in all five graded games.  Professional career  Richburg was considered one of the best center prospects for the 2014 NFL Draft. He was drafted by the New York Giants in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft, becoming the most recent Colorado State offensive lineman to be selected in an NFL Draft, following Shelley Smith in 2010. =New York Giants= Due to numerous injuries to offensive lineman in his rookie season, most notably to guards Chris Snee and Geoff Schwartz, Richburg, despite initially intended as the backup center in his rookie season, was forced to play out of position at guard. Because of his limited experience and relatively small size for the position, he struggled. In 2015, Richburg was returned to his natural position of center, and with a year of NFL experience under his belt, he soon showed himself to be among the league's best centers; Pro Football Focus ranked him as the NFL's #2 center for the 2015 season. In Week 3 against the Washington Redskins on September 25, 2016, Richburg was ejected for committing two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. He became the first player to be ejected under this new rule since NFL applied it during the beginning of 2016. On November 4, 2017, Richburg was placed on injured reserve with a concussion. =San Francisco 49ers= On March 14, 2018, Richburg signed a five-year, $47.5 million contract with the San Francisco 49ers. Washington Redskins In Week 14 of the 2019 season, Richburg suffered a torn patellar tendon and was ruled out for the rest of the season. He was placed on injured reserve on December 11, 2019. Without Richburg, the 49ers reached Super Bowl LIV, but lost 31-20 to the Kansas City Chiefs. He was placed on the active/physically unable to perform list (PUP) at the start of training camp on July 28, 2020, and placed on the reserve/PUP list at the start of the regular season on September 5, 2020.

Made of bronze, it is one of only a few helmets dating from the Iron Age to ever have been found in Britain. The helmet currently resides in the British Museum, and is undergoing conservation work. It was found by an anonymous metal detectorist, who found it together with an iron brooch and a pin, and it is thought to have contained a bag with cremated human remains.  Construction  The helmet was made of sheet bronze, and was of the Coolus style, a type used by both Gallic Warriors and Roman Legionaries, with a bowl shape and a flared beck to protect the back of the head and neck. This type of helmet was common on the continent, but is not commonly seen in Britain, though this may simply be due to the lack of finds from this era.  Context  It is unclear where exactly the helmet is from. It is thought by some historians that it may be the burial of a Roman soldier from Caesar's Invasions of Britain, or that it may be the helmet of a British mercenary who had served against the Romans in Gaul, and had adopted a Continental helmet style. Other historians and archaeologists believe it is simply a helmet inspired by Gallic designs. As the helmet was found in 2012, debate still rages about its nature and origin.

Byrne was born in Waterford, Ireland, the son of Robert Byrne. He left Ireland for New York City in 1848, and settled there, carrying on the business of general auctioneer in that city as well as in Boston. Towards the end of 1852 he left America for Victoria, arriving in Melbourne. In February 1853, he commenced auctioneering at Sandridge, now called Port Melbourne, and represented the district in the Melbourne Corporation prior to its being constituted a separate municipality. At the general election of 1864 Byrne contested Sandridge for a seat in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in the Liberal interest against the Hon. David Moore, but was defeated by three votes, and was unsuccessful on petition. Shortly afterwards he was returned for Crowlands by a very large majority. In 1869, when Sir James McCulloch went outside the House for a Commissioner of Customs, Byrne carried a motion censuring the Government, which was taken by them as a vote of want of confidence, on which they resigned, a new Ministry being formed on 20 September 1869, with the Hon. John Alexander MacPherson as Chief Secretary and Byrne as Treasurer. When, however, the latter sought re-election at the hands of his constituents, he was defeated by George Rolfe, the gentleman to whose appointment he had objected, and retired from office on 21 January 1870, being succeeded by Graham Berry. Byrne did not re-entered public life unsuccessfully contesting the upper house seats of Central Province in 1878, Melbourne Province in 1888, and the lower house seat of Avoca in 1880.

The latter was one of several of the same type which saw service on the Reynolds, Huletts and Chakaskraal sugar plantations in Natal. First World War In 1915, while the military campaign was in progress against German forces in Deutsch-S√ºdwest-Afrika (DSWA) during the First World War, an urgent need arose for additional locomotives for use on the narrow- gauge lines in that territory. The South African Railways (SAR) therefore purchased these three 0-4-0T locomotives second-hand on behalf of the Defence Department. The two engines from Rand Mines were numbered NG91 and NG92, while the engine from Reynolds Brothers was numbered NG95. Since a narrow-gauge locomotive classification system had not yet been implemented on the SAR, they were not classified. Service Whether all three were placed in service by the SAR is not certain, since engine no. NG95 from Reynolds Brothers would not be usable without first being regauged to gauge. It is also unclear whether any of them were actually placed in service in DSWA or whether they were used to replace other SAR narrow-gauge locomotives which had been commandeered by the Union Defence Forces for war service in DSWA. The locomotives were withdrawn from SAR service and sold towards the end of the war in 1918.

As his father-in-law suggested, Whately went to Oxford to study for the ministry, and was incorporated at St. Edmund Hall on 15 July 1602. He graduated M.A. on 26 June 1604. Shortly Whately was chosen lecturer in Banbury; and was instituted on 9 February 1610, on the king's presentation, to the vicarage of Banbury. His preaching attracted some from Oxford to hear him. With other ministers he delivered lectures at Stratford-on-Avon. Whately died at Banbury on 10 May 1639. He was buried in the churchyard under a raised monument, now destroyed, with an inscription preserved by a copy made on 13 July 1660. He was popular in Banbury, a fact referred to ironically by Richard Corbet, in his Iter Boreale, written about 1625, in referring to the neglected condition of his church. Works Whately caused himself trouble by the publication of A Bride-Bvsh; or a Direction for Married Persons. Plainely describing the Dvties common to both, and peculiar to each of them (London, 1619; republished 1623; Bristol, 1768; translated into Welsh, Llanrwst, 1834). In it he propounded that \\"the sin of adultery or wilfull desertion dissolveth the bond and annihilateth the covenant of matrimonie\\"; and raised a storm of opposition in the church. He was convened before the Court of High Commission, but, retracting his propositions on 4 May 1621, was dismissed. To the second edition (1623) he appended an address to the reader explain he had erred; and again in A Care Cloth he denied his earlier opinion. Whately was also author of: * The Redemption of Time, London, 1606. * A Caveat for the Covetous, London, 1609. * The New Birth, London, 1618; 2nd edit. 1622. * God's Husbandry, London, 1622; republished London, 1846. * A Pithie, Short, and Methodicall opening of the Ten Commandements, London, 1622. * Mortification, London, 1623. * Charitable Teares, London, 1623. * A Care-Cloth; or a Treatise of the Cvmbers and Troubles of Marriage, London, 1624. * Sinne no more, London, 1628, a sermon preached on the occasion of a fire which on Sunday, 2 March 1628, destroyed almost the whole of Banbury town. * The Poore Man's Advocate, London, 1637. * The Oyle of Gladness, or Comfort for Dejected Sinners, London, 1637. * Prototypes (posthumous), London, 1640; 2nd edit. 1647. A posthumous volume of sermons was issued by his executors, Henry Scudder and Edward Leigh. Whately's library, catalogued by Edward Millington (London, 1683), was sold at Bridge's coffee-house in Pope's Head Alley on 23 April 1683. Family Whately married Martha, daughter of George Hunt, fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and for 51 years rector of Collingbourne Ducis, Wiltshire. George Hunt was the son of John Hunt, an evangelical Protestant condemned to be burnt by Queen Mary, but reprieved by her death. By his wife, buried at Banbury on 10 December 1641, Whately had two sons: *William (d. 24 January 1647), who was perhaps the William Whately who became mayor of Banbury; and *Thomas, vicar of Sutton-under-Brailes, Warwickshire, an ejected minister of 1662; he later preached at Milton, Woodstock, and Long Combe, Oxfordshire, and was buried at Banbury on 27 January 1698.

T is said to be the opaque forest, or barrier of C. C is said to be the coverage of T. While any forest that covers C is a barrier of C, we wish to find the one with shortest length. It may be the case that T is constrained to be strictly interior or exterior to C. In this case, we specifically refer to a barrier as interior or exterior. Otherwise, the barrier is assumed to have no constraints on its location. Several opaque forests for a unit square. Top left: the perimeter of the square, length 4. Top right: The perimeter of the square, less one edge, length 3. Bottom left: the Steiner tree of the vertices, length 1 + . Bottom right: the conjectured optimal solution, length + /2.  History and difficulty  The opaque forest problem was originally introduced by Mazurkiewicz in 1916. Since then, not much progress has been made with respect to the original problem. There does not exist any verified general solution to the problem. In fact, the optimal solution for even simple fixed inputs such as the unit square or equilateral triangle are unknown. There exist conjectured optimal solutions to both of these instances, but we currently lack the tooling to prove that they are optimal. While general solutions to the problem have been claimed by several individuals, they either haven't been peer reviewed or have been demonstrated to be incorrect.  Bounding the optimal solution  Given a convex polygon C with perimeter p it is possible to bound the value of the optimal solution in terms of p. These bounds are individually tight in general, but due to the various shapes that can be provided, are quite loose with respect to each other. In general, one can prove that p/2 ‚â§ OPT ‚â§ p. = Upper bound = Tracing the perimeter of C is always sufficient to cover it. Therefore, p is an upper bound for any C. For internal barriers, this bound is tight in the limiting case of when C is a circle; every point q on the perimeter of the circle must be contained in T, or else a tangent of C can be drawn through q without intersecting T. However, for any other convex polygon, this is suboptimal, meaning that this is not a particularly good upper bound for most inputs. For most inputs, a slightly better upper bound for convex polygons can be found in the length of the perimeter, less the longest edge (which is the minimum spanning tree). Even better, one can take the minimum Steiner tree of the vertices of the polygon. For internal barriers, the only way to improve this bound is to make a disconnected barrier. = Lower bound = Various proofs of the lower bound can be found in . To see that this is tight in general, one can consider the case of a stretching out a very long and thin rectangle. Any opaque forest for this shape must be at least as long as the rectangle, or else there is a hole through which vertical lines can pass through. As the rectangle becomes longer and thinner, this value approaches p/2. Therefore, this bound is tight in general. However, for any shape that actually has a positive area, some extra length will need to be allocated to span the shape in other directions. Hence this is not a particularly good lower bound for most inputs. = Special cases = For the unit square, these bounds evaluate to 2 and 4 respectively. However, slightly improved lower bounds of 2 + 10‚àí12 for barriers that satisfy a locality constraint, and 2 + 10‚àí5 for internal barriers, have been shown.  Approximations  Due to the difficulty faced in finding an optimal barrier for even simple examples, it has become very desirable to find a barrier that approximates the optimal within some constant factor. provide several linear- time approximations for the optimal solution. For general barriers, they provide a 1/2 + (2 + )/ = 1.5867... approximation ratio. For connected barriers, they improve this ratio to 1.5716. If the barrier is constrained to a single arc, they achieve a ( + 5)/( + 2) = 1.5834 approximation ratio.  Barrier verification and computing the coverage of forests  Most barrier constructions are such that the fact that it covers the desired region is guaranteed. However, given an arbitrary barrier T, it would be desirable to confirm that it covers the desired area C. As a simple first pass, one can compare the convex hulls of C and T. T covers at most its convex hull, so if the convex hull of T does not strictly contain C, then it cannot possibly cover T. This provides a simple O(n log n) first-pass algorithm for verifying a barrier. If T consists of a single connected component, then it covers exactly its convex hull, and this algorithm is sufficient. However, If T contains more than one connected component, it may cover less. So this test is not sufficient in general. The problem of determining exactly what regions any given forest T consisting of m connected components and n line segments actually covers, can be solved in Œò(m2n2) time. The basic procedure for doing this is simple: first, simplify each connected component by replacing it with its own convex hull. Then, for vertex p of each convex hull, perform a circular plane-sweep with a line centered at p, tracking when the line is or isn't piercing a convex hull (not including the point p itself). The orientations of the sweep-line during which an intersection occurred produce a \\"sun\\" shaped set of points (a collection of double-wedges centred at p). The coverage of T is exactly the intersection of all of these \\"suns\\" for all choices of p. While this algorithm is worst-case optimal, it often does a lot of useless work when it doesn't need to. In particular, when the convex hulls are first computed, many of them may overlap. If they do, they can be replaced by their combined convex hull without loss of generality. If after merging all overlapping hulls, a single barrier has resulted, then the more general algorithm need not be run; the coverage of a barrier is at most its convex hull, and we have just determined that its coverage is its convex hull. The merged hulls can be computed in O(nlog2n) time. Should more than one hull remain, the original algorithm can be run on the new simplified set of hulls, for a reduced running time.

Location  Haardt Castle lies on the eastern slopes of the Haardt mountains above the eponymous village on the northeastern edge of the site of the medieval Winzingen Castle, which once belonged to the Counts Palatine of the Rhine.  History  Winzingen Castle was first built in the 10th and 11th centuries and repaired several times after times of war. In 1696 it was so badly damaged by shellfire in the War of the Palatine Succession that, despite provisional repairs, it finally fell into ruins during the 18th century. In 1804, after French Revolutionary Troops had conquered the Left Bank of the Rhine for the French state, the nobility and the church had their estates seized and their land auctioned. As a result, the dilapidated Winzingen Castle and its surrounding land went into private ownership. The wealthy Neustadt businessman, Schuster, converted the estate at considerable expense into a park-like gardens and built the remains of the medieval palas into a wine press hall. Commerzienrat August Ritter von Clemm, one of the co-founders of BASF, bought the land in 1875 and had the villa built in 1876 in order to use it as a lordly mansion. Not until 1893, when a circular pavilion and a large terrace were completed, did construction work finally end. From 1928 to 1971 Haardt Castle was a Kur and recovery home, later a hotel and restaurant. In 1971 the current owner bought the entire complex. The main building was restored and converted in 2002, during the course of which 19th century wallpaper was found behind the wall coverings.  Use today  Today, Haardt Castle houses residential accommodation and a guest house. The guest house was opened again in 2005 and it has wellness suite attached. Its hillside location offers expansive views over the Upper Rhine Plain. Part of the land is open to the public; but the owner reserves the right to close the estate whenever desired.

Mating strategies overlap with reproductive strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring. Relative to those of other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of marriage.Low, B.S. (2007). \\"Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage\\". Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 449. Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term intimate relationship, marriage, casual relationship, or friendship. The human desire for companionship is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature and may be related to the sex drive. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the courtship process and the process of forming an interpersonal relationship. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see animal sexual behavior).  Theoretical background  = Parental investment = Research on human mating strategies is guided by the theory of sexual selection, and in particular, Robert Trivers' concept of parental investment. Trivers defines parental investment as ‚Äúany investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving (and hence reproductive success) at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring.‚Äù The support given to each offspring typically differs between the male and female parents, which is called differential parental investment. Trivers posited that differential parental investment between males and females drives the process of sexual selection. In turn, sexual selection leads to the evolution of sexual dimorphism in mate choice, competitive ability, and courtship displays (see also secondary sex characteristics). Minimum parental investment is the least required care needed to reproduce. In humans, females have a higher minimum parental investment. They have to invest in internal fertilization, placentation, and gestation, followed by childbirth and lactation. However, males do not have to invest as much, but many males contribute high investment to their offspring. While human males can invest heavily in their offspring as well, their minimum parental investment is still lower than that of females. While females have to at least invest in pregnancy, the minimum parental investment of a male is his sperm cells. This same concept can be looked at from an economic perspective regarding the costs of engaging in sexual relations. Females incur the higher costs, as they carry the possibility of becoming pregnant among other costs.Buss, D.M., & Schmitt, D.P. (1993). \\"Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating\\". Psychological Review, 100(2), 204. Conversely, males have comparatively minimal costs of having a sexual encounter. Therefore, evolutionary psychologists have predicted a number of sex differences in human mating psychologies. = Life history strategies = Life history theory helps to explain differences in timing of sexual relationships, quantity of sexual partners, and parental investment. According to this theory, organisms have a limited supply of energy, which they use to develop their bodies. This energy is put on a theoretical spectrum of how organisms prioritize energy use. At one end of the spectrum, the organism prioritizes speeding up physical development and reaching sexual maturation quickly, which is deemed a fast strategy. Additionally, fast strategy organisms seek to have sexual relationships earlier, several mates, and invest little in their offspring. On the other end of the spectrum, is slow strategy, where the organism prioritizes development of a high quality body. Slow strategy organisms seek to have sexual relationships later, few mates, and invest more heavily in their offspring. These strategies are unconscious and help increase the organism's reproductive success in a given environment. Early childhood environments dictate which strategy a person unconsciously pursues. In a hostile environment, risks and unpredictability are increased and therefore survival is less likely than in safe environments. A fast strategy is more likely to be pursued by an organism in a hostile environment in order to reach maturity and reproduce quickly. In safe environments, an organism is likely to pursue a slow strategy to develop its body first and then reproduce. Each strategy is optimized for their specific environmental characteristics. Therefore, the life history strategy influences the mating strategy of the individual animal. This concept has been applied to humans as well. Additionally, there are differences in life history strategies both between and within species.  Sex similarities  =Flirting= To bond or express sexual interest, people flirt. Kate Fox, a social anthropologist, posits two main types of flirting: flirting for fun and flirting with intent. Flirting for fun can take place between friends, co-workers, or total strangers who wish to get to know each other. This type of flirting does not seek sexual intercourse or romantic relationship, but increases the bonds between two people. Flirting with intent plays a role in mate-selection. The person flirting sends out signals of sexual availability to another, and hopes to see the interest returned to encourage continued flirting. Flirting can involve non-verbal signs, such as an exchange of glances, hand-touching, hair- touching, or verbal signs, such as chatting up, flattering comments, and exchange of telephone numbers to enable further contact. =Dating= People date to assess each other's suitability as a partner in an intimate relationship or as a spouse. Dating rules may vary across different cultures, and some societies may even replace the dating process by a courtship instead. =Matchmaking= In many cultural traditions, a date may be arranged by a third party, who may be a family member, acquaintance, or professional matchmaker. In some cultures, a marriage may be arranged by the couple's parents or an outside party. In the 2000s, internet dating has become popular.  Sex differences  = Short-term and long-term mating = Due to differential parental investment, the less investing sex should display more intrasexual competitiveness. This is because they can invest less in each offspring and therefore can reproduce at a higher frequency, which allows them to compete for more mates. Additionally, the higher investing sex should be more choosy in their mate. Since they have a higher minimum parental investment, they carry greater costs with each sexual encounter. These costs lead them to have higher selection standards and therefore are more choosy. In humans, males are typically the less investing sex and females are the more investing sex. Since males are the less investing sex in humans, they should pursue a short-term mating strategy more than females. Short term mating is characterized by casual, low commitment sexual relationships with many partners that do not last a long time. Additionally, males benefit more from short-term mating than females do. Because males generally pursue short-term mating strategies, their overall reproductive success is higher than females, however it is also more variable. This means that males are able to have more offspring on average, however only relatively few males are able to have a very large number of offspring. Due to this short-mating strategy, males have a greater desire for sexual variety, need less time to consent to intercourse, and seek short-term mates more than females. However, females also pursue short-term mates, but the motivations differ from males. Females can benefit from short-term mating in numerous ways. First, it allows for a quick extraction of resources. Women in a stressed situation may benefit from protection from a male and short term mating is a way to achieve this as is seen in contemporary asylum seeker anthropological studies. Additionally, they mate with a high mate value male that they would not be able to if they pursued a long-term strategy. This allows them to get access to higher quality genes. One prominent hypothesis is that ancestral women selectively engaged in short-term mating with men capable of transmitting genetic benefits to their offspring such as health, disease resistance, or attractiveness (see good genes theory and sexy son hypothesis). Since women cannot inspect men's genes directly, they may have evolved to infer genetic quality from certain observable characteristics (see indicator traits). One prominent candidate for a \\"good genes\\" indicator includes fluctuating asymmetry, or the degree to which men deviate from perfect bodily symmetry. Other candidates include masculine facial features,Gangestad, S.W., & Thornhill, R. (2003). \\"Facial masculinity and fluctuating asymmetry\\". Evolution and Human Behavior, 24(4), 231‚Äì241. behavioral dominance,Simpson, J.A., Gangestad, S.W., Christensen, P.N., & Leck, K. (1999). \\"Fluctuating asymmetry, sociosexuality, and intrasexual competitive tactics\\". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76(1), 159. and low vocal pitch.Puts, D.A., Gaulin, S.J., & Verdolini, K. (2006). \\"Dominance and the evolution of sexual dimorphism in human voice pitch\\". Evolution and Human Behavior, 27(4), 283‚Äì296. Evolutionary psychologists have therefore indicated that women pursuing a short-term mating strategy have higher preferences for these good gene indicators, and men who possess good genes indicators are more successful in pursuing short-term mating strategies than men who do not. Indeed, research indicates that self- perceived physical attractiveness,Clark, A.P. (2006). \\"Are the correlates of sociosexuality different for men and women?\\". Personality and Individual Differences, 41(7), 1321‚Äì1327. fluctuating asymmetry,Thornhill, R., & Gangestad, S.W. (1994). \\"Human fluctuating asymmetry and sexual behavior\\". Psychological Science, 5(5), 297‚Äì302. and low vocal pitchApicella, C.L., Feinberg, D.R., & Marlowe, F.W. (2007). \\"Voice pitch predicts reproductive success in male hunter-gatherers\\". Biology Letters, 3(6), 682‚Äì684. are positively related to short-term mating success in men but not in women. Women prefer purported good genes indicators more for a short-term mate than for a long-term mate, and a related line of research, known as the ovulatory shift hypothesis, shows that women's preferences for good genes indicators in short- term mates tends to increase during peak fertility in the menstrual cycle just prior to ovulation.Gildersleeve, K., Haselton, M.G., & Fales, M. (in press). \\"Do Women‚Äôs Mate Preferences Change across the Ovulatory Cycle? A Metaanalytic Review\\". Psychological Bulletin. Conversely, long-term mating is marked by serious committed sexual relationships with relatively few partners. While males generally pursue a short-term mating strategy when possible, females typically pursue a long-term mating strategy. Long-term strategies are characterized by extended courtships, high investment, and few sexual partners. While pursuing a long-term strategy, females are able to get resources from males over the course of the relationship. Female mating psychology is generally more focused on finding high quality mates rather than increasing the quantity of their mates, which is reflected in their pursuit of a long-term strategy. Additionally, they also benefit from higher parental investment by males. Women are thought to seek long-term partners with resources (such as shelter and food) that provide aid and support survival of offspring. To achieve this, women are thought to have evolved extended sexuality. The key benefit for males pursuing a long-term strategy is higher parental certainty. However, both sexes pursue both strategies and get benefits from both strategies. Additionally, humans typically do not pursue the extremes of either short or long-term mating strategies. = Mate value = Mate values correspond to future reproductive success likelihood of an individual. Mate value contains the ability of the individual to produce healthy offspring in the future, based on the individual's age and sex. The mate value of each sex is determined by what the opposite sex desires in a mate, so male mate values is determined by what females desire and vice versa. Over time, the individuals who had higher mate values had higher reproductive success. These qualities that make up mate value evolved into what is consider physically attractive. Thus individuals with a high mate value are perceived to be more attractive by the opposite sex than those with low mate value. Additionally, individuals with a high mate value are more able to be more choosy in their mates and reproduce more often than those with a low mate value. Due to biological differences between the sexes, it is predicted that there are differences in what the sexes desire in a mate. Therefore, it is thought that there are differences between male and female mate values. Mate value is perceived through signals and cues. Signals are characteristics that have been selected for because they offer reliable changes in receiver behavior that lead to higher reproductive success for the receiver. Conversely, cues have not been selected for to carry meaning, instead they are byproducts. However, with sexual selection, cues can become signals over time. Costly signals are ones that require intense effort for the signaler to send. Because they require high investment, costly signals are typically honest signals of underlying genetic qualities. However, signals that are not costly enough can be faked and therefore are not associated with the underlying benefits. Evolutionary psychologists have predicted that men generally place a greater value on youth and physical attractiveness in a mate than do women. Youth is associated with reproductive value in women, because their ability to have offspring decrease dramatically over time compared to men. Therefore, males typically prefer to mate with females who are younger than themselves, except when they are maturing in their teens. The features that men find physically attractive in women are thought to signal health and fertility. Additionally, physical attractiveness signals genetic quality for both males and females. Men who preferentially mated with healthy, fertile, and reproductively valuable women would have left more descendants than men who did not. Since men's reproductive value does not decline as steeply with age as does women's, women are not expected to exhibit as strong of a preference for youth in a mate. However, male mate value is partly based upon his ability to acquire resources.Buss, D.M. (1989). \\"Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures\\". Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 12(1), 1‚Äì49. This is because one of the costs of pregnancy is the limited ability to get resources for oneself. Additionally, it signals ability of the male to commitment and invest in the female and her offspring. Male resource investment increases the likelihood the offspring will survive and reproduce itself. Due to this, females are typically attracted to older males, since they are likely to have a greater ability to provide resources and have a higher social status. Evolutionary psychologists have speculated that women are relatively more attracted to ambition and social status in a mate because they associate these characteristics with men's access to resources.Shackelford, T.K., Schmitt, D.P., & Buss, D.M. (2005). \\"Universal dimensions of human mate preferences\\". Personality and Individual Differences, 39(2), 447‚Äì458. Women who preferentially mated with men capable of investing resources in themselves and their offspring, thereby ensuring their offspring's survival, would have left more descendants than women who did not. Male mate value is also determined by his physical and social dominance, which are signals to high quality genes. = Sexual desire = Sexual selection theory states that because of their lower minimum parental investment, men can achieve greater reproductive success by mating with multiple women than women can achieve by mating with multiple men.Pellegrini & Long (2003) ‚ÄúA sexual selection theory longitudinal analysis of sexual segregation and integration in early adolescence‚Äù Evolutionary psychologists therefore argue that ancestral men who possessed a desire for multiple short-term sex partners, to the extent that they were capable of attracting them, would have left more descendants than men without such a desire. Ancestral women, by contrast, would have maximized reproductive success not by mating with as many men as possible, but by selectively mating with those men who were most able and willing to invest resources in their offspring. Gradually in a bid to compete to get resources from potential men, women have evolved to show extended sexuality. One classic study of college students at Florida State University found that among 96 subjects chosen for attractiveness, approached on campus by opposite-sex confederates and asked if they wanted to \\"go to bed\\" with him/her, 75% of the men said yes while 0% percent of the women said yes.Clark, R.D., & Hatfield, E. (1989). \\"Gender differences in receptivity to sexual offers\\". Journal of Psychology & Human Sexuality, 2(1), 39‚Äì55. Evidence also indicates that, across cultures, men report a greater openness to casual sex,Schmitt, D.P. (2005). \\"Sociosexuality from Argentina to Zimbabwe: A 48-nation study of sex, culture, and strategies of human mating\\". Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 28(2), 247‚Äì274. a larger desired number of sexual partners,Schmitt, D.P. (2003). \\"Universal sex differences in the desire for sexual variety: tests from 52 nations, 6 continents, and 13 islands\\". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 85(1), 85. and a greater desire to have sex sooner in a relationship. These sex differences have been shown to be reliable across various studies and methodologies.Baumeister, R.F., Catanese, K.R., & Vohs, K.D. (2001). \\"Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive? Theoretical views, conceptual distinctions, and a review of relevant evidence\\". Personality and Social Psychology Review, 5(3), 242‚Äì273.Oliver, M.B., & Hyde, J.S. (1993). \\"Gender differences in sexuality: a meta-analysis\\". Psychological Bulletin, 114(1), 29. However, there is some controversy as to the scope and interpretation of these sex differences.Conley, T.D., Moors, A.C., Matsick, J.L., Ziegler, A., & Valentine, B.A. (2011). \\"Women, Men, and the Bedroom: Methodological and Conceptual Insights That Narrow, Reframe, and Eliminate Gender Differences in Sexuality\\". Current Directions in Psychological Science, 20(5), 296‚Äì300.Schmitt, D.P., Jonason, P.K., Byerley, G.J., Flores, S.D., Illbeck, B.E., O‚ÄôLeary, K.N., & Qudrat, A. (2012). \\"A Reexamination of Sex Differences in Sexuality New Studies Reveal Old Truths\\". Current Directions in Psychological Science, 21(2), 135‚Äì139. Evolutionary research often indicates that men have a strong desire for casual sex, unlike women. Men are often depicted as wanting numerous female sexual partners to maximize reproductive success. Evolutionary mechanisms for short-term mating are evident today. Mate-guarding behaviors and sexual jealousy point to an evolutionary history in which sexual relations with multiple partners became a recurrent adaptive problem,Buss, D.M., & Shackelford, T.K. (1997). \\"From vigilance to violence: Mate retention tactics in married couples\\". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, 346‚Äì361. while the willingness of modern-day men to have sex with attractive strangers,Clark, R.D., & Hatfield, E. (1989). \\"Gender differences in receptivity to sexual offers\\". Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality, 2, 39‚Äì55. and the prevalence of extramarital affairs in similar frequencies cross-culturally, are evidence of an ancestral past in which polygamous mating strategies were adopted.Buss, D.M. (1994). \\"Individual differences in mating strategies\\". Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 17, 581‚Äì582. By contrast, journalist Daniel Bergner, who dismisses evolutionary biology, argues that monogamy has been used to control human female sexual behavior and that the human female sex drive is not lower than the human male sex drive. Flanagan and Cardwell argue that men could not pursue this ideology without willing female partners. Every time a man has a new sexual partner, the woman also has a new sexual partner. It has been proposed, therefore, that casual sex and numerous sexual partners may also confer some benefit to females. That is, they would produce more genetically diverse offspring as a result, which would increase their chances of successfully rearing children to adolescence, or independence. Error management theory states that psychological processes should be biased to minimize costs of making incorrect judgments and decisions. Since males generally pursue a short-term mating strategy, the costs of not having sexual intercourse is higher than having sexual intercourse. Therefore, the cost for a male thinking a female does not desire to engage in sexual intercourse when if fact she does is higher than perceiving a female does want to have sexual intercourse when she does want to engage in intercourse. Conversely, since females generally pursue a long-term strategy, the costs of having sexual intercourse is higher than not having sexual intercourse. Therefore, the cost for a female of perceiving a male wants to invest when he does not is higher than perceiving a male doesn't not want to invest when in fact he does want to invest. Due to these costs, males and females have developed separate psychological mechanisms where males over perceive female desire for sex and females under perceive male commitment. However, males accurately perceive female commitment and females accurately perceive male sexual interests. = Mate retention = In addition to acquiring and attracting mates, humans need to retain their mate over a certain period of time. This is especially important in long-term, pair-bonded relationships. It has been hypothesized that feelings of love have evolved to keep humans in their mating relationship. It has been shown that feelings of love motivate individuals to pursue their current partner and stray away from alternatives. Additionally, proclaiming feelings of love increases the attachment and commitment to the current partner. Further, when proclaiming recalling love and commitment, Oxytocin, a hormone associated with pair-bonding activities, increases in the bloodstream. This links physiological indicators with mate retention behaviors. Despite this link, maintaining a pair-bonded relationship can be difficult, especially around alternative mates. When presented with alternative mates with a high mate value, humans tend to view their current relationship less favorably. This occurs when males are presented with physically attractive females, and it occurs for females when they are present with socially dominant males. However, there are psychological counter- measures to these processes. First, individuals in a committed relationship tend to devalue alternative mate options, thus finding them less attractive. Second, these individuals don't always consider potential alternatives. Instead they pay less attention to alternative mates and therefore don't undergo the devaluation process. These mechanisms tend to happen unconsciously and help the individual maintain their current relationship. There are several strategies that an individual can do to retain their mate. First off, individuals should engage in more mate retention strategies when their mate is of high value. Therefore, males with more physically attractive mates and females with males that have more resources engage in more mate retention behaviors. Additionally, to retain their mates, males undertake resource displays and females enhance their physical appearance. Finally, jealousy helps maintain relationships. Jealousy is associated with the threat of mate loss and helps individuals engage in behaviors to keep their current mate. However, males and females differ on what cues jealousy. Since males have issues confirming parental certainty, they become more jealous than females for sexual cheating. However, historically females needed male resources for offspring investment. Therefore, females become more jealous over emotional cheating, as it threatens the devotion of resources to her and her offspring.  Individual differences  = Sociosexual Orientation Inventory = Just as there are differences between the sexes in mating strategies, there are differences within the sexes and such within-sex variation is substantial.Gangestad, S.W., & Simpson, J.A. (2000). \\"The evolution of human mating: Trade-offs and strategic pluralism\\". Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 23(04), 573‚Äì587. Individual differences in mating strategies are commonly measured using the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI), a questionnaire that includes items assessing past sexual behavior, anticipated future sexual behavior, and openness to casual sex.Simpson, J.A., & Gangestad, S.W. (1991). \\"Individual differences in sociosexuality: evidence for convergent and discriminant validity\\". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60(6), 870. Higher scores on the SOI indicate a sexually unrestricted mating strategy, which indicates an openness to casual sex and more partners. Conversely, lower scores on the SOI indicate a sexually restricted mating strategy, which a focus on higher commitment and less partners. Several studies have found that scores on the SOI are related to mate preferences, with more sexually restricted individuals preferring personal/parenting qualities in a mate (e.g. responsibility and loyalty), and with less sexual restricted individual preferring qualities related to physical attractiveness and social visibility.Simpson, J.A. & Gangestad, S.W. (1992). \\"Sociosexuality and romantic partner choice\\". Journal of Personality, 60(1), 31‚Äì51. Other studies have shown that SOI scores are related to personality traits (i.e. extraversion, erotophilia, and low agreeableness),Wright, T.M., & Reise, S.P. (1997). \\"Personality and unrestricted sexual behavior: Correlations of sociosexuality in Caucasian and Asian college students\\". Journal of Research in Personality, 31(2), 166‚Äì192. conspicuous consumption in men as a means to attract women,Sundie, J.M., Kenrick, D.T., Griskevicius, V., Tybur, J.M., Vohs, K.D., & Beal, D.J. (2011). \\"Peacocks, Porsches, and Thorstein Veblen: conspicuous consumption as a sexual signaling system\\". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 100(4), 664. and increased allocation of visual attention to attractive opposite-sex faces.Duncan, L.A., Park, J.H., Faulkner, J., Schaller, M., Neuberg, S.L., & Kenrick, D.T. (2007). \\"Adaptive allocation of attention: Effects of sex and sociosexuality on visual attention to attractive opposite-sex faces\\". Evolution and Human Behavior, 28(5), 359‚Äì364. = Short-term vs. long-term mating = Evolutionary psychologists have proposed that individuals adopt conditional mating strategies in which they adjust their mating tactics to relevant environmental or internal conditions, which is called strategic pluralism. The concept of sexual pluralism states that humans do not pursue the same mating strategy all of the time. There are different motivations and environmental influences that determine the mating strategy which a person will adopt. The long-term and short-term mating behaviors are trigger in the individual by the current strategy being pursued. Therefore, not only are there differences between the sexes in long-term and short-term mating, but there are also differences within the sexes. To the extent that ancestral men were capable of pursuing short-term mating strategies with multiple women, they tend to do so. However, not every male is able to pursue this option. Additionally, even though most women pursue a long term mating strategy, some females pursue a short-term strategy.  Differences within males  When possible, males will typically pursue a short-term mating strategy. The ability to do this depends upon their mate value, so males with a high mate value are more likely to pursue a short-term mating strategy. High mate value males have been shown to have sexual intercourse earlier and more often than low mate value males. Self-esteem and physical attractiveness have been shown to be related to male pursuing a short term mating strategy. Additionally, males with more testosterone have been shown to pursue more short-term strategies. However, not all males pursue a short-term mating strategy. There are several reasons for this. First, long- term mating has its own advantages that have already been discussed. Second, while males of higher mate value and status have opportunities to pursue short-term mates, low mate value males typically do not have the same opportunities. Since females generally prefer long-term mating strategies, the few who would mate in the short-term are already paired with the high mate value males. Additionally, the benefits of short-term mating for females are only obtained through high mate value males. Therefore, low status males are more likely to pursue long-term mating strategy.  Differences within females  While more attractive males tend to pursue a short-term mating strategy, more attractive females tend to pursue a more long-term mating strategy. Additionally, younger females are more likely to pursue a short-term mating strategy, as well as those who are not satisfied with their current partner. The ovulatory cycle has been shown to influence a female's mating strategy. In the late follicular phase, women are the most fertile in the ovulatory cycle. During this time, there is evidence that females tend to pursue a short-term oriented mating strategy over a long-term one. Additionally, female sexual desires increase as well as their attraction towards more masculine males. Additionally, female mating strategies can change across their lifetime. In their early thirties, females experience a peak in sexual desire. In turn, this increase influences females to pursue a more long or short term oriented strategy depending on the mate value of their current partner. = Mating plasticity = Research on the conditional nature of mating strategies has revealed that long-term and short-term mating preferences can be fairly plastic. Following exposure to cues that would have been affected mating in the ancestral past, both men and women appear to adjust their mating preferences in ways that would have historically enhanced their fitness. Such cues include the need to care for young, danger from animals and other humans, and resource availability. Additionally, there is evidence that the female sex drive is more plastic than male sex drive, because they are the selecting sex. Since females typically chose when and with whom to engage in sex, this sex drive plasticity could be an affect of female mate choice.  Environmental predictors  = Culture = Evolutionary psychologists have investigated different strategies and environmental influences across different cultures and confirmed that men tend to report a greater preference for youth and physical attractiveness in a mate than do women. Additionally, women tend to report a greater preference for ambition and social status in a mate than do men. The specific role that culture plays in modulating sex differences in mate preferences is subject to debate.Gangestad, S.W., Haselton, M.G., & Buss, D.M. (2006). \\"Evolutionary foundations of cultural variation: Evoked culture and mate preferences\\". Psychological Inquiry, 17(2), 75‚Äì95.Schmitt, D.P. (2011). When the difference is in the details: a critique of Zentner and Mitura (2012)\\" Stepping out of the caveman's shadow: Nations' gender gap predicts degree of sex differentiation in mate preferences\\". Evolutionary psychology: an international journal of evolutionary approaches to psychology and behavior, 10(4), 720‚Äì726. Cultural variations in mate preference can be due to the evolved differences between males and females in a given culture. Culture also has a link to mating strategies in the form of marriage systems in the society. Specifically, pathogens have been linked to whether a society is more likely to have polygynous or monogamous marriage systems. Cultures with high pathogen stress are more likely to have polygynous marriage systems, especially exogamous polygamy systems. This is helpful for both males and females, as males obtain greater genetic diversity for their offspring and females have access to healthy males, which are typically lacking in high pathogen societies. Conversely, monogamy is often absent from high pathogen environments, but common in low pathogen environments. Further, since physical attractiveness is thought to signal health and disease resistance, evolutionary psychologists have predicted that, in societies high in pathogen prevalence, people value attractiveness more in a mate. Indeed, research has confirmed that pathogen prevalence is associated with preferences for attractiveness across nations.Gangestad, S.W., & Buss, D.M. (1993). \\"Pathogen prevalence and human mate preferences\\". Ethology and Sociobiology, 14(2), 89‚Äì96. Women in nations with high pathogen prevalence also show greater preferences for facial masculinity.DeBruine, L.M., Jones, B.C., Crawford, J.R., Welling, L.L., & Little, A.C. (2010). \\"The health of a nation predicts their mate preferences: cross-cultural variation in women's preferences for masculinized male faces\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 277(1692), 2405‚Äì2410. Researchers have also reasoned that sexual contact with multiple individuals increases the risk of disease transmission, thereby increasing the costs of pursuing a short-term mating strategy. Consistent with this reasoning, higher pathogen prevalence is associated with lower national SOI scores.Schaller, M., & Murray, D.R. (2008). \\"Pathogens, personality, and culture: disease prevalence predicts worldwide variability in sociosexuality, extraversion, and openness to experience\\". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 95(1), 212. Finally, several studies have found that experimentally manipulating disease salience has a causal influence on attractiveness preferences and SOI scores in predicted directions.Murray, D.R., Jones, D.N., & Schaller, M. (2012). \\"Perceived threat of infectious disease and its implications for sexual attitudes\\". Personality and Individual Differences.Lee, A.J., & Zietsch, B.P. (2011). \\"Experimental evidence that women's mate preferences are directly influenced by cues of pathogen prevalence and resource scarcity\\". Biology Letters, 7(6), 892‚Äì895.Little, A.C., DeBruine, L.M., & Jones, B.C. (2011). \\"Exposure to visual cues of pathogen contagion changes preferences for masculinity and symmetry in opposite-sex faces\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 278(1714), 2032‚Äì2039. = Sex ratio = The local operational sex ratio has been shown to have an impact on mating strategies. This is defined as the ratio of marriage-age males to marriage age females, with a high ratio representing more males and a low ratio representing more females in the local area. When there is an imbalance of sexes, the rare sex typically has more choice, while the plentiful sex has to compete more strategically for the rare sex. This leads to the plentiful sex competing on specific areas that the rare sex finds attractive. Additionally, the plentiful sex will adopt more of the rare sex's mating strategy. For example, with a low sex ratio, females will adopt a more short-term mating strategy and will compete more intensely on things like physical attractiveness. However, with a high sex ratio, males will adopt a more long-term strategy to attractive females. In 2005, the evolutionary psychologist David Schmitt conducted a multinational survey of sexual attitudes and behaviors involving 48 countries called the International Sexual Description Project (ISSR). Schmitt assessed relationships between several societal-level variables and average scores on the SOI. One variable that was shown to significantly predict a nation's average SOI score was the Operational Sex Ratio (OSR). This prediction was confirmed; OSR was significantly positively correlated with national SOI scores. Another variable that Schmitt predicted would influence SOI scores was the need for biparental care. In societies where extensive care from both parents is needed to ensure offspring survival, the costs of having sex with an uncommitted partner are much higher. Schmitt found significant negative correlations between several indices of need for biparental care (e.g. infant mortality, child malnutrition, and low birth-weight infants) and national SOI scores. = Income = Some sex differences in mate preferences may be attenuated by national levels of gender equity and gender empowerment.Eagly, A.H., & Wood, W. (1999). \\"The origins of sex differences in human behavior: Evolved dispositions versus social roles\\". American Psychologist, 54(6), 408.Zentner, M., & Mitura, K. (2012). \\"Stepping Out of the Caveman‚Äôs Shadow Nations‚Äô Gender Gap Predicts Degree of Sex Differentiation in Mate Preferences\\". Psychological Science, 23(10), 1176‚Äì1185. For example, as women gain more access to resources their mate preferences change. Finding a mate with resources becomes less of a priority and a mate with domestic skills is more important. As women's access to resources varies between cultures, so does mate preference.Gangestad, S.W., Haselton, M.G., & Buss, D.M. (2006). Evolutionary foundations of cultural variation: \\"Evoked culture and mate preferences\\". Psychological Inquiry, 17(2), 75‚Äì95. In light of these findings, it has been suggested that both female physical attractiveness and male access to resources be thought of as ‚Äúnecessities‚Äù in a mate. Other qualities, such as humor, are thought of as ‚Äúluxuries.‚Äù Therefore, humans first look for the necessities in a mate. After they have obtained the specific necessities, individuals can then place value on the luxury qualities. This helps to explain some of the debate of the role of resources and attractiveness in mate value.  Political and religious attitudes  Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that mating strategies can influence political attitudes. According to this perspective, different mating strategies are in direct strategic conflict. For instance, the stability of long-term partnerships may be threatened by the availability of short-term sexual opportunities. Therefore, public policy measures that impose costs on casual sex may benefit people pursuing long-term mating strategies by reducing the availability of short-term mating opportunities outside of committed relationships. One public policy measure that imposes costs on people pursuing short-term mating strategies, and may thereby appeal to sexually restricted individuals, is the banning of abortion. In a doctoral dissertation, the psychologist Jason Weeden conducted statistical analyses on public and undergraduate datasets supporting the hypothesis that attitudes towards abortion are more strongly predicted by mating-relevant variables than by variables related to views on the sanctity of life.Weeden, Jason (2003). Genetic interests, life histories, and attitudes towards abortion. Scholarly Commons. University of Pennsylvania. Weeden and colleagues have also argued that attitudes towards drug legalization are driven by individual differences in mating strategies. Insofar as sexually restricted individuals associate recreational drug use with promiscuity, they may be motivated to oppose drug legalization. Consistent with this, one study found that the strongest predictor of attitudes towards drug legalization was scores on the SOI.Kurzban, R., Dukes, A., & Weeden, J. (2010). \\"Sex, drugs and moral goals: reproductive strategies and views about recreational drugs\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 277(1699), 3501‚Äì3508. This relationship remained strong even when controlling for personality traits, political orientation, and moral values. By contrast, nonsexual variables typically associated with attitudes towards drug legalization were strongly attenuated or eliminated when controlling for SOI and other sexuality-related measures.

Michele was married for nearly 30 years to the physician Martin MacNeill and was the mother of eight children. She died in Pleasant Grove, Utah, on April 11, 2007, while at home recovering from cosmetic surgery performed eight days earlier. At her husband's request, the operating surgeon prescribed four medicines for her recovery; two of the drugs, Diazepam and Oxycodone, would not normally be prescribed to his patients. Michele had been concerned during her recovery that Martin was having an affair and that she had been given medication by him inappropriately. Her daughter Alexis, a medical student at that time, then took responsibility for giving Michele her medicine. Michele recovered sufficiently for Alexis to return to school and Michele died the following day. Initially, police and autopsy reports concluded that Michele died of cardiovascular disease, but after being pressed to review the toxicology report, the state's chief medical examiner found that the combination of medicines in her body could have contributed to cardiac death. During the trial, which began on October 17, 2013, Chief Prosecutor Chad Grunander stated, \\"It was an almost perfect murder, [MacNeill] pumped her full of drugs that he knew would be difficult to detect once she was dead.\\" Martin MacNeill was convicted of Michele's murder and obstruction of justice in a widely publicized case involving marital infidelity, sexual abuse, and outward religious devotion. Martin MacNeill was sentenced to 17 years to life. He committed suicide in prison in April 2017. Personal life Michele Marie Somers was born in 1957, the daughter of Milton and Helen Somers. Michele grew up in Concord, California, where she played violin, acted, and was a cheerleader and homecoming queen. She was a straight-A student and an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Michele was an exchange student in Switzerland, a model, and Miss Concord in 1976. Michele met Martin MacNeill (born February 1, 1956) at an activity for LDS young adults. Martin had joined the military in 1973 at the age of 17. He was placed on disability leave for mental health reasons in 1975 and received veterans' benefits for years. Michele eloped with Martin and the couple was married on February 21, 1978. Four months after the marriage, Martin served a six-month jail sentence for forgery, theft and fraud. In 2007, the MacNeill family lived in a gated community in Pleasant Grove, Utah, and were active in their LDS congregation. Michele was the mother of eight children, Rachel, Vanessa, Alexis, Damian, Giselle, Elle, Sabrina and Ada, four of whom were supposedly adopted from Ukraine. However, although Ada MacNeill was adopted by Michele and Martin, Ada is actually the daughter of Vanessa MacNeill, and Michele and Martin's biological granddaughter. Martin MacNeill was the medical director of Utah State Development Center, in American Fork, Utah. Martin had served as an LDS bishop (lay leader of a congregation). He was formerly a physician practicing in Pleasant Grove, served in the military, and received his law degree, but did not practice law. Investigators later determined that Martin had falsified university transcripts to enter the California medical school where he earned his degree in osteopathic medicine and also falsified his later application to law school.John Meyersohn (2011). After Wife's Death, Dark Secrets of Utah Doctor Revealed, ABC News.com, February 25, 2011, accessed June 2, 2011 He was reputedly dissatisfied with his marriage, made statements about wanting a divorce and had extramarital affairs, including a relationship with Gypsy Willis before and after the death of his wife. Martin and Michele had been married for 29 years, 2 months and 10 days at the time of her death. On January 16, 2010, MacNeill's 24-year-old son Damian Alexander MacNeill committed suicide. He was a law student at New York Law School at the time. Prior to Damian's death, the Utah County Attorney's Office sent a letter to New York Law School stating that \\"[i]nvestigators in the Utah County Attorney's Office deemed him [Damian] to be a very dangerous individual who possessed homicidal impulses and discussed the 'joys of killing'\\" and that \\"Damian was present in Pleasant Grove on the date of his mother's death.\\" Events leading up to the murder =Troubled marriage= According to Rachel MacNeill, Michele MacNeill heard Martin threaten to commit suicide many times. In 1994, Martin was accused of having sexual relations with a patient at the BYU Health Center and threatened suicide. According to police reports, Martin MacNeill threatened to kill himself and Michele with a butcher knife in August 2000 after Michele caught him looking at pornography. Martin threatened suicide again in 2005 when Michele again caught him looking at pornography. In February 2007, Michele confronted Martin repeatedly about her suspicions that he was having an affair. Martin had at least two affairs in the 2005‚Äì2007 time frame‚Äîone with Anna Osborne Walthall and another with Gypsy Willis. =Cosmetic surgery= In March 2007, Martin MacNeill presented the idea to Michele of having cosmetic surgery. Michele was reluctant to have the surgery performed in the short term, preferring to postpone the operation for health reasons. She wanted to ensure that her high blood pressure was well under control and preferred to lose some weight before surgery. Martin pressed for the surgery, and Michele reportedly agreed to the facelift because she thought it would help her marriage. At Michele's last consultation before surgery, Martin, who was a physician at the time, reportedly gave the plastic surgeon a list of drugs he wanted prescribed to Michele. The surgeon prescribed Lortab, Ambien, Valium, Percocet (Oxycodone), Phenergan and Keflex. Dr. Scott Thompson, who performed the surgery, admitted that he did not normally prescribe Diazepam (or Valium) and Oxycodone for his patients. The medication was stronger than what the surgeon would normally prescribe. The surgery was conducted on April 3, 2007. Michele spent the night in the hospital and was released on April 4. The following morning, Michele was found to be \\"unresponsive\\" by her oldest daughter, Alexis, who was on break from medical school. Her father, Martin, told her that he \\"probably over-medicated\\" his wife. Although Michele survived, Alexis then took care of dispensing medicine to her mother during the rest of her stay at her parents' home. According to Alexis, Michele was fearful of Martin's efforts to give her medicine she did not need. On April 6, 2007, Michele told Alexis that \\"if anything happens to me, make sure it was not your dad.\\" =Mistress= On April 6, Michele confronted Martin about numerous calls and text messages to Gypsy Willis. During the trial, prosecutors contended that MacNeill killed his wife so he could be with his mistress, Gypsy Willis (aka Gypsy Jyll Willis, aka Jillian Giselle MacNeill). MacNeill hired Willis as a nanny for his youngest children two weeks after murdering Michele and they were both convicted of identity theft, using the identity of MacNeill's adopted daughter for Willis's benefit. The daughter had been sent back to Ukraine. =Health condition= During the weeks leading up to the murder, MacNeill gave the impression that he had contracted a medical condition that required him to walk with a cane. His medical records showed that he had been in good health. Martin MacNeill also \\"had been collecting veteran benefits for decades, saying in an application he had bipolar or anti-social disorders\\". =Death and autopsy= Alexis returned to medical school on April 10, 2007, believing that her mother's recovery was well under way. The following day, April 11, 2007, Michele MacNeill and Alexis talked at 8:44 a.m. MST and Michele said that she was doing well. At 9:10 a.m., Martin called Alexis asking her to call her mother, saying he was concerned that she wasn't doing well and wasn't getting out of bed. Michele died at the age of 50 in the bathtub of her home in Pleasant Grove. Although Martin said that he was at work in the morning, he was not seen in public until 11:00 a.m, when he arrived at a local Safety Fair. After picking up his youngest daughter Ada from school at about 11:35 a.m., they arrived back at the home between 11:35 and 11:46 a.m., and Ada found her mother unresponsive, head down in the master bathroom bathtub. Martin ordered his son, Damian MacNeill, or Damian's girlfriend, to get rid of all of Michele's medication, ostensibly to keep the plastic surgery a private matter. Michele was declared dead later that day. An autopsy was performed, and her cause of death was determined to be cardiovascular disease. Police and autopsy reports concluded that Michele's death was accidental and of natural causes. The children of Michele and Martin MacNeill questioned their mother's cause of death, and pressed for a review of the toxicology report. In addition, in September 2007, Linda Cluff, Michele's sister, wrote a letter to the then governor of Utah, Jon Huntsman, and the Utah County Attorney's Office asking them to investigate Michele's death. Dr. Todd Grey, the State of Utah's chief medical examiner, performed the review, and found that none of the medicines found in her body were at toxic levels, but that the combination of Promethazine (Phenergan), Zolpidem (Ambien), Diazepam (Valium) and Oxycodone (Percocet) \\"could have led to sedation and heart arrhythmia, resulting in cardiac death\\". Because of Grey's report, her manner of death was changed on October 6, 2010, to \\"undetermined\\" and the cause to \\"combined effects of heart disease and drug toxicity\\". It was noted that Michele would not have been able to administer the medication to herself. Memorial service Michele's memorial service was held on April 14, 2007, at the church located adjacent to the Mt. Timpanogos Temple. Martin spoke at the service and rather than focus on Michele he talked about how life had been unfair to him. Identity theft In 2009, Martin was sentenced to four years in prison for federal identity theft charges. He had used the identifying information from his adopted daughter Giselle to obtain false legal documents for his girlfriend Gypsy Willis in Giselle's name. His stated motive was tax evasion, as Willis owed substantial sums to the Internal Revenue Service and Martin wished to avoid any possible liability for these debts.Janice Peterson (2009). \\"Martin MacNeill sentenced to 4 years in prison for ID theft\\", The Daily Herald, August 13, 2009, accessed June 2, 2017 He was released from prison on the identity theft charges in July 2012, whereupon Utah county officials announced that Martin was a suspect in the murder of his wife.Jim Dalrymple (2012) \\"Doctor subject of murder investigation after release from prison\\", The Daily Herald, July 16, 2012, accessed June 2, 2017 In 2011, Willis was sentenced to three years' probation for her part in the identity theft scheme, with credit for 180 days in jail awaiting trial.Jim Dalrymple, \\"Gypsy Willis sentenced to 3 years of probation\\", The Daily Herald, May 18, 2011, accessed June 2, 2017 Murder charges and trial On August 24, 2012, the Utah County Attorney's Office charged Martin with murdering Michele. Martin's trial began on October 17, 2013. Martin MacNeill pleaded not guilty, claiming his wife died due to accidental death. Medical examiners did not rule that her death was the result of murder, but prosecutors convinced the jury that Martin MacNeill was responsible for killing his wife by drowning and prescription drugs. The arrest warrant stated that earlier in his life, MacNeill had attempted to murder his mother and had killed his brother, Rufus Roy MacNeill, who had been found dead in a bathtub. MacNeill had not been tried for his brother's death. After the prosecution filed a motion to ban camera coverage of the trial, the Utah 4th District Court, upholding a state rule which went into effect on April 1, ruled that the trial could be broadcast and live-streamed‚Äîthe first in Utah history. Coverage would exclude video of testimony by federal inmates who feared retaliation. The 22-day trial was litigated by Chief Prosecutor Chad Grunander and Martin MacNeill's defense team included Randall Spencer and Susanne Gustin. In his closing statement to the jury, Grunander stated, \\"It was an almost perfect murder, [MacNeill] pumped her full of drugs that he knew would be difficult to detect once she was dead.\\" During the trial, a previous mistress of Martin MacNeill testified that MacNeill had stated that there was a way to kill a person that would appear to be a natural heart attack. Fellow inmates claimed that MacNeill had claimed he killed his wife, but it could not be proven. The defense claimed that Michele MacNeill had overdosed on her prescribed medication and fallen into the bathtub and drowned. The jury deliberated for 11 hours and on November 9, 2013, found MacNeill guilty of the first degree murder of his wife, Michele, on April 11, 2007. He was also convicted by the Provo, Utah, jury of obstruction of justice for hindering the investigation of his wife's murder by attempting to make Michele's death appear accidental. The murder conviction carries a term of fifteen years to life, with an additional one to 15 years for obstruction. On December 6, 2013, it was reported that he had attempted suicide while in jail. In addition to the murder trial, Martin was found guilty of forcible sexual abuse of his daughter, Alexis Somers, and was sentenced for one to 15 years for that crime. Sentencing On September 19, 2014, MacNeill was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years up to life in prison for his first-degree murder conviction plus another term of one to 15 years for his conviction on obstruction of justice charges. Since Fourth District Judge Derek Pullan made the murder and obstruction sentences consecutive to the sexual abuse sentence, MacNeill would not have been eligible for parole for at least 17 years (about September 19, 2031). MacNeill, 60, committed suicide in prison on April 9, 2017, two-and-a-half years into his sentence. He was found lifeless on an outside yard near the prison's greenhouse. According to the report from the Unified Police Department, MacNeill used a hose and a natural gas line that was in place as a heater for the greenhouse to kill himself.

Varma's main office in Salmisaari is in the foreground. Varma Pension Insurance Company (Finnish: Keskin√§inen ty√∂el√§kevakuutusyhti√∂ Varma) is one of the largest private investors and among the largest earning-related pension insurance companies in Finland. In addition to managing statutory TyEL insurance for employees and YEL insurance for the self-employed, Varma offers its customers statutory vocational rehabilitation and services relating to predicting and managing work ability risks. Varma is a mutual company and its head office is located in Salmisaari, Helsinki. In 2019, Varma paid out pensions in the amount of 5.9 billion euros to 343,700 people and made 22,340 new pension decisions. Premiums written amounted to 5.3 billion euros, and at year-end 541,926 people were insured with Varma. In terms of turnover, Varma was the ninth-biggest company in Finland. In 2020 Varma had 900,000 workers insured by them. Varma‚Äôs central executive bodies are the Annual General Meeting, the Supervisory Board, the Board of Directors and the President and CEO. History =1998‚Äì2013= Varma started its operations in July 1998 when Pension Sampo and around two thirds of Pension Varma merged, creating Finland‚Äôs largest earnings-related pension company called Varma-Sampo. Varma-Sampo changed its name to Varma on 31 December 2003. It was the largest earnings-related pension company in Finland. Matti Vuoria was appointed as Varma‚Äôs President and CEO in 2004 when his predecessor Paavo Pitk√§nen retired. Before that, Vuoria was the Chairman of the Board of Fortum. =2014‚Äì= Risto Murto took on the post of Varma‚Äôs President and CEO at the beginning of 2014 when his predecessor Matti Vuoria retired. Murto was previously Varma‚Äôs Deputy CEO. In 2016, Varma‚Äôs investments yielded a return of 4.7 per cent. Their value amounted to 42.9 billion euros at year-end and the company‚Äôs solvency amounted to 10.2 billion euros. In the spring 2017 charging points for 250 electric cars were installed in Varma's parking facility. At the time the charging system was among the largest in the world. During April to June, Varma reduced its share weight by five percentage points by decreasing its holdings in US shares due to President Donald Trump‚Äôs inability to co-operate and resulting problems. Varma‚Äôs return on investments stood at 7.8%. The value of Varma‚Äôs investments grew to 45.4 billion euros, and solvency capital increased by 1.3 billion euros to 11.5 billion euros. The average annual real investment return of Varma‚Äôs investments over five years had been 5.8 per cent, and over 10 years 3.0 per cent. The plunge in share prices in late 2018 dropped Varma‚Äôs return on investments to -2 per cent. In early 2019, Varma generated its best half-yearly result in investment returns in 20 years: 6.9 per cent or 3 billion euros. Varma‚Äôs full-year returns amounted to more than 5.2 billion euros, with the return percentage amounting to 12. Over 10 years, Varma‚Äôs pension assets had generated a total return of 26 billion euros and the pension assets doubled. In December, Varma announced that it had created a new fund with the asset management company LGIM and index investment company Foxberry. The exchange-traded fund invests in the United States, and it extensively takes sustainability criteria into consideration. Varma invested 500 million euros in the fund listed on the London Stock Exchange. Investments Varma is one of the largest private investors in Finland. Varma invests the assets collected as pension contributions for current and future pensions. The company mainly invests in fixed income, equity, real estate investments, and in hedge funds. Varma‚Äôs investment assets amounted to approximately 48.7 billion euros in 2019. Varma‚Äôs returns exceeded 5.2 billion euros. The investment class with the highest return was listed equities, with a return of 25.4 per cent; for unlisted equities, the return was 16.9 per cent and for private equity slightly over 15 per cent. The return on fixed-income investments was 4.5 per cent and on real estate 4.1 per cent. =Real Estate= Varma‚Äôs real estate investment portfolio includes both direct real estate investments in Finland and domestic and international real estate funds. Varma's main business relays on its office and business premises but it provides also of rental housing. In 2016, Varma invested in the TaunusTurm office property in central Frankfurt together with another pension insurance company Elo. Varma was the fourth- largest real estate investor in Finland in 2017. In 2019, the value of Varma‚Äôs real estate investments portfolio totalled approximately 4 billion euros. In 2020, Varma is developing a wooden office building in Katajanokka, Helsinki, which will house Stora Enso‚Äôs head office, other office premises and a hotel. Social responsibility In 2016, Varma published a climate policy for its investments. In practice, the company committed to aligning its investment portfolio with the Paris climate agreement. Varma began to build its ‚Äúsustainable development equity portfolio‚Äù in the summer 2016. The portfolio invests in companies that benefit from climate change mitigation, have clear targets concerning climate change or do not incur major costs from adapting to climate change. At the end of 2016, the value of the portfolio was approximately 300 million euros and it included developed market companies in several sectors, both manufacturing and consumer companies. In 2017, the carbon footprint of Varma's listed equity investments declined by 27 % compared to the 2015 baseline. This result was achieved by increasing the share of low-emissions industries and by avoiding emissions-intensive industries such as energy and mining. In January 2019, Varma announced that it had updated its ‚Äúinvestment blacklist‚Äù of its excluded investees. The tobacco industry and nuclear weapons were included on the list in 2004. The list has also included industry manufacturing controversial weapons (anti-personnel landmines, cluster munitions, chemical and biological weapons) for a long time. A new addition were companies that rely on coal- or lignite-based operations for more than 30 per cent of their net sales. In November Varma announced that it will revise its climate objectives to have a carbon-neutral investment portfolio by 2035. The aim was to focus on investments that mitigate the progress of climate change. In 2020, Varma‚Äôs goal was for its investment portfolio to be carbon neutral by 2035. For example, the heating of its real estate investments should be emission-free by 2030 and their electricity by 2025.

Entwistle decided to record his own version on his live solo album Left for Live as a tribute to Moon instead.  Reception  Mike DeGagne of Allmusic reviewed the recording, stating \\"Daltrey's thunderous but passionate ode to his former friend and drummer Keith Moon is a fervent downpour of frustration that can be truly felt inside every line of the song.

Sometime in the 6th century Scuthin left Ireland to pursue a life of cenobitic monasticism at Tyddewi in Wales founded by St. David, whom at a later date he is reported to have saved from poisoning. According to the Irish Ecclesiastical Record,archive.org/stream/irishecclesiasti10dubluoft/irishecclesiasti10dubluoft_djvu.txt(Vol 10 (1874), 141-161.) St. Scuithin, having attained advanced ascetic virtues, returned to Ireland c. 540 to live the life of a hermit monk, building himself an austere and isolated cell. This cell was located at Freynestown, on the Johnswell hills in the ancient barony of Slieve Margy, Kingdom of Ossory. This habitat would become known in Irish as tigh scuithin and evolve into Tiscoffin monastery as noted in the List of monastic houses in Ireland. In the Irish language tigh scuithin means the house/abode of Scuithin. This has been anglicised as Tiscoffin and preserved as one of the civil parishes in Ireland within the Kilkenny Barony of Gowran. The county Kilkenny town of Castlewarren in the Diocese of Ossory also preserves his name with the church of St. Scuithin. The townland of Freynestown is closely associated with St. Scuithin. St. Scuithin of Bed-Yscolan There exists an apparently significant historical reference to St. Scuithin in the ancient annals of Wales. William Forbes Skene, in the Four Ancient Books of Wales, (Edinburgh, 1868) while reviewing poems in the Black Book of Carmarthen makes reference to this saint. There is a poem in which St. Scuithin, described as Yscolan, is confronted by the figure of Myrddin Wyllt. A portion of the poem reads: Black thy horse, black thy cope, black thy head, black thyself, Yes, black art thou, Yscolan. I am Yscolan the scholar, slight is my clouded reason, there is no drowning the woe of him who offends a sovereign.... Skene further states that the same name occurs in the lives of St. David, when he is said to have met an Irish ecclesiastic called Scuthyn, at a place later called Bed-y-Scolan. William Jenkins Rees//carmarthenshirehistorian.org/cgi- bin/twiki/view/Historian/WilliamJenkinsRees17721855 in his Lives of the Cambro-British Saints, states: > St. Scothin had also another name, that is Scolan and on a certain Easter > Day and on the spot where he conversed with St. David, an oratory was > erected which in after times was called Bed-y-Scolan, i.e., St. Scuithin's > cell. Carmarthen Fan Asceticism of St. Scuithin It is recorded that St. Scuithin led a life of austere self-discipline and on being quizzed by his contemporary St. Brendan how he was preserved from temptation, he responded that whenever he slept, two heavenly virgins, i.e., divine hope and charity, kept watch by his side to protect him from evil attack. He was so spiritualized by his constant penance, and so unconcerned with worldly attractions, that he is said to have been able to walk on water. Legend states that once while performing this act on the waters between Ireland and Wales he met St. Finbarr in his boat. St. Scuithin grasped a variegated flower - a scuitliin from the water and threw it to St. Finbarr saying: ‚ÄúSee how, by the mercy of God, it is in a flowery meadow that we are journeying.\\" To which St. Finbarr replied: ‚ÄúThis is not a flowery meadow, but the sea;\\" and plunging his hand into the water, he caught a salmon which he tossed to St. Scuithin, saying: \\"See how richly it is supplied by God to minister to our wants.\\" The note in the Felire of St. Oengus adds, that it was on account of that variegated flower that our Saint received his name of Scuithin. St. Scuithin of Slieve Margy and St. Gobban of Old Leighlin Location map for St. Scuithin's and St.Gobban's monasteries. The ancient habitat and personae of St. Scuithin is often confused with that of St. Gobban of Old Leighlin which is some seven kilometres distant. St. Gobban founded his monastery in the early 7th century; it would later evolve into St. Laserian's Cathedral, Old Leighlin, County Carlow. Confusion exists regarding the various holy men named St. Goban. The close proximity of these two ancient ecclesiastical sites, plus the passage of time, distortion of language and dialect has entwined and confused the true identities of these saints of early Celtic Christianity. St. Scuithin and St. Goban were two distinct historical persons. St. Scuithin in the Annals He was described in the History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory as: :Scothin, son of Setnae. son of Trebthach, son of Dal, son of Laidir (Cu-corb's charioteer), son of Imrossa Nith, son of Fertlachtga, son of Fergus mac Roig.http://www.forgottenbooks.org/readbook_text/The_History_and_Antiquities_of_the_Diocese_of_Ossory_v3_1000284267/397 He is also entered January 2, in The Martyrology of Donegal as: :Sguithin of Tech-Sguithin, in Sliabh Mairge, in Leinster.O'Donovan, John, James Henthorn Todd and William Reeves (1864).

This young Valkyrie is always cheerful and has an adoring follower in Sanada, her maid. Valkyrie, in her 8 year old form, also calls Kazuto \\"Kazie\\" (in the English dub) which is one of the ways she shows her childlike crush on him, which is stronger in her adult form. : The protagonist of the series and a princess from Planet Valhalla, in the Dolphin Constellation. Once Valkyrie learned that her father was planning a political marriage for her without her consent, she fled to Earth and crash landed on Kazuto's bathhouse. In order to save his life she had to give half of her soul to him, but that process turned her into an 8 year old girl. She can only regain her normal form by kissing Kazuto but it doesn't last long and she normally kisses him in order to protect him. She eventually develops deep feelings of love for Kazuto. Her powers include flight, energy manipulation and defensive shields, plus she gains the Key of Time at the start of the second season, which is capable of a number of things (though before, she already had an object that looked exactly like it). Oddly, early on she's able to use it her child form and adult form, but later only uses it her adult form. When it is later revealed that Kazuto is the one that she will marry, she is overjoyed, but it is difficult for the ceremony to take place since she keeps on reverting to her child form. :At the end of the 3rd season, due to a mishap with the Princess Mural, Valkyrie's older and younger selves split into two separate people. During the 4th season, Valkyrie's former classmates mistake her younger self to be her daughter, until she displays knowledge about them convinces them she really is the younger Valkyrie. ; Kazuto Tokino : : Kazuto is the owner of a bathhouse which he is trying to run in part to honor his late grandfather who loved the bathhouse. He is one of the few that actually likes the idea as his parents refer to it as a \\"money pit\\" and think him a fool to even try to run it. Though somewhat stubborn in running what many believe to be an outdated and failing business, he is considered to be a kind and hard-working soul, which eventually impresses and endears all those around him, including the Valhallan Royal Family. He is nearly killed in Valkyrie's crash landing but saved when she gives him half her soul. He also seems drawn to her in a way and finds himself falling in love with her, but unsure with how to deal with her childlike appearance at times. Eventually, he does see beyond her childlike appearance and loves the Valkyrie within. He plans to marry the princess and eventually is recognized as her official fiance. ; Hydra : : Hydra is one of the eight princesses of Valhalla, and sees herself as Valkyrie's rival. Hydra followed Valkyrie to earth because she knew that if Valkyrie ran away, she would have to take her place at the wedding, which was not something she wanted to do. Because of that, she chased after her to Earth to bring her back. However, she crash landed on Akina's temple. She initially tries to bring Valkyrie back by force, but that's made impossible when her powers are sealed by Akina in retaliation for crashing into her temple, making her become a child just like Valkyrie. However, unlike Valkyrie, her mind is that of her adult form, not a child's. She still made some attempts to get Valkyrie sent back, but they all failed miserably. Much like a kiss can restore Valkyrie, the seal on Hydra can be released by Akina's will. Hydra has a short temper and is rather tomboyish, acting in a rash manner that shows action before thinking things through, meaning she is prone to destroy things that get in her way. She can transform into a winged pink and yellow horse and has several other powers, such as flying, superhuman strength, and firing powerful energy blasts when she is in adult form. She has taken up kendo while living with Akina, and often pokes fun at Akina's breast size and her feelings for Kazuto, which typically results in Akina hitting her. Due to special circumstances, if she and Akina argue too much, they can fuse into a powerful warrior called Akidra, containing the combined sum of their powers. They can still converse with each other in this state, and the fusion reverses if they become too agreeable with one another. ; Sanada : : Chief maid of the royal family of Valhalla, the planet Valkyrie original comes from; Ms. Sanada, a cat-girl, is a faithful and very loyal servant. Upon learning of the princess‚Äôs disappearance, she tracked her down to Kazuto's house where she settled at once, considering Kazuto to be Valkyrie's official fianc√©. Even seeing how Valkyrie becomes a smaller version of herself doesn't seem to trouble Ms. Sanada at all as she finds the smaller Valkyrie to be very cute. In fact, Sanada describes her as a 'Valkyrie fundamentalist'. She also fully supports her love interest in Kazuto. In order to ensure her main goal of keeping Valkyrie safe, she sometimes causes more trouble than good. One of these instances is when she uses her \\"Cat Ear Gun\\" (Nekomata, or Cat-Girl Ray Gun in the English version) to turn a number of the city's girls into an army of brainwashed catgirl maids for the crime of just being near Kazuto, and when she attempted to also do so to Akina, it led a fight that destroyed much of the city when Hydra got involved. In later episodes, these maids are summoned to aid her by a whistle. When not serving her, they act pretty much like normal, but wearing maid outfits... and Ms. Sanada never sees fit to remove their brainwashing, vexing some fans. Somewhat cruelly, Ms. Sanada doesn't usually remember their names. During the third series, Ms. Sanada takes on a kind of 'superhero identity' to help Valkyrie and Kazuto. Somewhat oddly, Ms. Sanada is hinted to have had a fondness for Valkyrie Ghost. ; Akina Nanamura : :A neighbor and childhood friend of Kazuto. She has considerable powers with the ability to attack with demon wards and to create barriers. She sealed away Hydra's powers after Hydra crash landed on her family's shrine and started wreaking havoc. She seems to have feelings for Kazuto as she is always stopping at his bathhouse. However, she never acts on these emotions, which she greatly regrets at times, as he and the Princess Valkyrie grow closer together. She later has to face the fact that they are in love and intend to marry. A couple of things to note is that Akina is a horrendous karaoke singer, and that she is quite self-conscious about the size of her chest, and always hits Hydra when she pokes fun at it. In the beginning of the second season, Valkyrie uses the Key of Time to make Akina's breasts grow to an immense size (At Hydra's joke request), which turns out to be a satisfying moment for her, but at the end of the season they go back to normal when Valkyrie reverses all of the actions she performed with the Key of Time. Due to special circumstances, if she and Hydra argue too much, they can fuse into a powerful warrior called Akidra, containing the combined sum of their powers. They can still converse with each other in this state, and the fusion reverses if they become too agreeable with one another. ; Rika Tokino : : Kazuto's younger sister, she helps him run the bathhouse but like her parents is concerned it is just a money pit and that they might soon be broke. She tends to act like a scrooge in general when it comes to money and she sees it as quite important, in one instance was even willing to sell Valkyrie away till she found the money offered was fake. She is also constantly studying in the hopes of getting into a good high school and later university. She doesn't seem very interested in having her own social life and even turned down the advances of the most popular boy at her school, though the two later became friends. She is all for the marriage between Valkyrie and Kazuto, since she sees it as a way for the family to get out of debt, (marrying into money so to speak). Secondary characters ; Mar : : Mar is very short and gets stepped on a lot, but despite this he is actually a hardened warrior. He's involved with the galactic pirates and also has a history with Spot. He's also an ace pilot with the nickname of Thundering Marduke. He was initially sent to kidnap Valkyrie and hold her for ransom, but was later swayed to Spot's side. His appearance almost copies Dengaku Man from Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo except he has a lightning bolt shape on his chest and the bit on his head is longer. ; Spot : : He is called Spottenheim in the English version (or \\"Shirokenhaimu\\" in Japanese), though chibi Valkyrie calls him Spot in English (\\"Shiro\\" in Japanese). His introduction into the series isn't explained, but he seems to be designated as Valkyrie's pet. He's a white, dog-like alien who happens to be a veteran fighter pilot who was once known as Spottenheim the Comet. He's still skilled, once singlehandedly holding off the fleet around Valhalla during the end of the first season when trying to provide a distraction for Kazuto. He lives at the Tokino residence and does household repairs. Normally, he is the plaything of the child Valkyrie and is tossed, ridden, and swung about like a rag doll. Despite all of the things Valkyrie does to him, he's extremely loyal to her, though he often tells Valkyrie not to pull on his ears. He has a surprisingly deep voice for such a small creature and is also very mature when not acting like Valkyrie's pet. ; Chorus : : She's one of the eight princesses of Valhalla, and she constantly refers to herself as a machine, though Hydra and Laine consider her as just plain nuts; In reality, she's one of those kinds of people who take fiction way too seriously. When she isn't acting crazy, she's actually shown to be very intelligent, though still eccentric, since she likes to sleep in closets. Chorus has been shown to have technopathy, the ability to sync with technology. She makes a cameo in the first series and plays a major role in the second season. Chorus likes to go on the Internet in Rika's closet, much to Rika's annoyance. She has the ability to feel psychic wavelengths (which allowed her to understand the pain Valkyrie Ghost goes through) and can even make them into pictures by using a computer printer. Chorus makes direct references to other anime, and other fictions in general. ; Laine : : The youngest of the eight princesses of Valhalla, she is basically a ditz and a terrible driver (Though she might be better than Hydra and Valkyrie, as she has yet to total her spaceship, or her ship is more durable). Unlike the other princesses, Laine constantly crashes her UFO, which is a compact, two-parter. She originally came to Earth to seek out Valkyrie due to her intense affection for her, but later develops romantic feelings toward Kazuto. She has the ability to transform her outward appearance into anyone she chooses. However, whatever appearance she takes, she will always have an antenna sticking out of her head, as well as her obvious feminine features, even when imitating a man. Pulling that antennae will immediately change her back. Her disguises aren't perfect, and anyone can figure her out by looking for the antennae, though her perverted personality and large curves usually give her away before that. During the third season, she takes a trip back in time to her academy days and corrects a mistake in her past. Occasionally, her past selves visit her in the present time, though why they haven't created any time paradoxes is anyone's guess. ; Mehm : : The eldest of the eight Valhallan princess, she is seen as the head of the Royal Family. She's somewhat of a nosy busybody, and she frequently visits the Tokino home, both to check up on Kazuto and Valkyrie's relationship, and to enjoy living away from all her royal duties. She is also known to be sensitive about her age, which is seen when she tells Rika to call her \\"Big Sister Mehm\\" instead of \\"Auntie Mehm\\". At the end of the first season, it was Mehm who decreed that Valkyrie would marry Kazuto, as she recognized Kazuto to be the only one who could truly understand and love Valkyrie. She possesses the ability to fly and fire beams of energy. ; Inarba : : She's the most serious- minded of the eight Valhallan princesses and stickler for the rules. She made a brief appearance in the first series, and plays a role in the third. She is considered the adjudicator of the Royal Family and has a special attack called the Thrust of Death, which sends anyone to the Punishment Dimension. Everyone fears her, even the violent Hydra. Inarba enforces the Law of Valhalla, and any offenders she meets will suffer the Punishment Dimension, which causes them to live out their greatest fears or some ironic punishment. Laine wasn't affected by it because she didn't pay any attention to what was going on when she was sent there. She comes to Earth to judge the members of the Royal Family and to make preparations for Kazuto and Valkyrie's wedding during the Stellar Season (Celestial Soul's Day in the English dub). So far, only Kazuto's sister was able to counter Inarba's Thrust of Death, in which the impressed Inarba declares Rika to be her eventual successor, though Rika sees the training as just more homework. ; Nesty : : Another of the eight princesses of Valhalla. She makes a brief appearance in the first series, and is not seen again until the final episode of the third series. Apparently she leads a sort of anti-pirate space fleet and she spends her time hunting down corsairs, criminals and such. She discovers an ancient artifact of Vahalla called the Princess Mural, in which past generations of princesses have had their weddings in front of it. She brings it to Earth so Kazuto and Valkyrie can be married in the same tradition, but that also causes the space pirates to come after it. (In her first appearance one of the characters accidentally calls her Chesty.) ; Pharm : : Like the other princesses, she only makes a momentary appearance at the end of the first season, but later shows up in the third. She crash-lands her UFO on top of Kazuto and Akina's high school (and ironically didn't cause any damage to it) and sets herself up as their homeroom teacher. Pharm has a fetish for women wearing large spectacles like the one she has on. She begins converting the girls at school wearing large eyeglasses, and comes into conflict with Ms. Sanada and the Cat-Girl Maid Squad. She later reveals that she wanted to see Valkyrie wear them. ; Valkyrie Ghost : : The main antagonist during the second season. In a contrast to the rest of the cast in the series, she's a dark and uncomical character. She is not a single individual person, but rather the combined energies and emotions of the four missing Princesses of Valhalla from ancient times that saved Valhalla from the destructive Blizzard of Time. She resembles Valkyrie in her adult form, but wears black clothes, and has purple eyes, which in her fighting form turn red. She chose the name Valkyrie Ghost since she resembles Valkryie. Valkyrie Ghost is searching for the legendary Illustrious Lover (Phantom Lover in the dub) of myth in hopes that she could cure her eternal sadness and loneliness. She finds him in Kazuto after feeling the absolute joy and happiness in Valkyrie. While at heart she simply wants to be released from her pain and has no malevolent intentions, she's very ruthless and has no problems hurting or killing anyone that gets in her way, once nearly killing Hydra. The missing four princesses are also the creators of Valkyrie's Key of Time, and she poses the ability to control it even when it isn't in her hand. Similar to Valkyrie, she transforms into a fighting form by kissing Kazuto. She can fly, but mostly fights by firing blasts of energy and can create force-fields. Her strongest attack consists of her bringing the eyes on her costume together and firing a combined stream of energy. She spends some time initially trying to win Kazuto's heart, and then kidnaps him when she feels she succeeded (though he didn't resist). She apparently can't be killed by fighting, since even when she was defeated by Akidra she still couldn't die. She was only stopped when Valkyrie used the Key of Time to release the emotions and energy that made up her form. ; Akidra : : This is the combined form of Akina and Hydra. When Akina began experimenting with some new incantations to fight against Valkyrie Ghost, she and Hydra are fused together during an argument. The end result is a white-haired shrine maiden with the powers of a Valhallan princess with mystic seals, who possess both the powers of Akina and Hydra, and has the two of them sharing the same body. Their combined abilities are magnified, enough so that could even defeat Valkyrie Ghost, but there are two drawbacks. In order to combine, Hydra and Akina must be in a state of disagreement, then touch hands. Normally, this is achieved whenever one of them does something to anger the other, usually Akina rattles Hydra by destroying some of Hydra's personal things. They once accidentally fuse during the third season because of an argument. Secondly, if the two are in agreement about anything (even something like not being able to agree on anything), they automatically separate. This condition makes it very difficult for them to cooperate during combat. That said, Akidra is a very effective combatant, managing to defeat Valkyrie Ghost on two occasions (who was more than a match for Akina and Hydra when they first fought her). = Cat-Girl Maid Squad = ; Keiko, Aiko, Yuko, and Eiko : : Four girls transformed into cat-girls by Ms. Sanada. They are the more prominent Cat-Girl Maid Squad at the Tokino Bathhouse and are the ones that are seen the most in the series. Before at last memorizing their names at least, Sanada referred to them as A, B, C and D. They are quick to denounce their fellow transformed cat girls when the rest are recruited into a rival princess' brainwashed cult of glasses wearing devotees much to Ms. Sanada's pride and chibi Hydra at the time makes an under the breath comment on Ms. Sanada's hypocrisy (only time in the series it's ever touched by the writers).

Description Teen Musical Theater of Oregon includes kids age 13 - 19 but will sometimes add children age 9 - 12, known as Children's Musical Theater of Oregon, depending on the show. Along with children and teens of this age, Teen Musical Theater will sometimes add \\"Guest Stars\\" to the shows who take on roles such as Daddy Warbucks in Annie and The Man In Chair from The Drowsy Chaperone. TMTO will generally put on three productions a year - a spring show, a summer show, and a winter show. TMTO will occasionally produce concerts with a smaller, selected cast. History Teen Musical Theater began back in 2006 with a spring production of Grease. At that time the production was called Children's Musical Theater of Ashland (CMTA) until it was later renamed Children's Musical Theater of Oregon (CMTO). The company was founded by composer and keyboardist John Taylor and his wife Rhonda Taylor. His inspiration to found this organization came from the impact John P. Healy Jr. had on him when he was a part of San Jose Children's Musical Theater. Shortly after the 2008 summer production of Oklahoma!, Children's Musical Theater of Oregon was adopted by Craterian Performances. During the spring 2010 performance of Will Rogers Follies, a new branch of Children's Musical Theater of Oregon was created, called Teen Musical Theater of Oregon. While CMTO is still a working entity of the organization, it has taken a back seat allowing TMTO to produce the majority of the Musical Theater of Oregon's productions. Original productions The company has made three original productions: Broadway: A Musical Journey, Broadway II: The Journey Continues, and Moving On: TMTO in Concert. The first two being revues of many Broadway songs from many different Broadway shows including Lion King, Damn Yankees, A Chorus Line, The Color Purple and Hairspray. The Broadway series was created as a collaboration between John Taylor and David McCandless. Moving On was created and directed by Cailey McCandless and was a sendoff concert for eight graduating seniors who had participated in TMTO for years.

Ferris c1897 Eugene W. Ferris (November 18, 1842 ‚Äì February 26, 1907) was a United States soldier who fought with the 30th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War. He received his nation's highest award for bravery during combat, the U.S. Medal of Honor, for resisting an attack by enemy cavalrymen near Berryville, Virginia on April 1, 1865. That award was conferred 32 years later on October 16, 1897. Formative years Born in Springfield, Vermont on November 18, 1841, Eugene W. Ferris was a son of New York native Robert Ferris and Fanny Ferris, a native of Vermont. He was just a child when he and his family relocated to Lowell, Massachusetts, according to historian Allan Tischler. By 1850, the Ferris household included parents Fanny and Robert (a stonemason), and their children, Helen, Fanny, Alexander and Eugene (aged 19, 18, 11, and 8, respectively). Also residing at the home were Ruth and Chester Rugg (a clerk), and Stillman Busher. After completing his education in Lowell, Eugene Ferris also went to work, having obtained a job as a bookkeeper.Tischler, Allan. \\"The Russell Road Campaign of 1865: A love triangle, two officers, and a belle from Clark County.\\" Clarke County, Virginia: The Observer of Clarke County, October 19, 2016.\\"Ferris, Robert H., Fanny (the mother), Helen, Fanny (the daughter), Alexander, and Eugene,\\" et. al. in U.S. Census (Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, 1850).

During this time, while the 30th Massachusetts was attached to the U.S. Army's 19th Corps under Major-General Philip Sheridan, he was wounded in action when the 30th Massachusetts was engaged in battle as part of the Union Army's tide-turning 1864 Shenandoah Valley Campaign. Military engagements included the battles of Opequon (Third Winchester) and Fisher's Hill in September and the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19.Tischler, \\"The Russell Road Campaign of 1865\\", The Observer. Afterward, they remained in the area, stationed near the Opequon Creek and the town of Berryville. Less than six months later, while serving as a regimental adjutant, Ferris performed the act of gallantry which became the catalyst for his Medal of Honor award. According to historian Robert W. Black, Ferris was already \\"combat experienced and had been wounded twice\\" when he and his orderly, Private James McLaughlin, were sent out by their superiors on April 1, 1865, to search for enemy guerillas in the area around Berryville, Virginia, and were set upon by members of Mosby's Rangers, a Confederate cavalry unit commanded by the \\"Gray Ghost\\", John Singleton Mosby. Facing off on the grounds of Colonel Daniel Bonham's farm near Sailor's Creek, Ferris refused a demand to surrender made by that enemy party's commanding officer (Charles Wiltshire) and shot that officer in the chest before he could draw his pistol. Dodging a bullet from a different Ranger's gun, he then shot that enemy cavalryman in the neck before wounding a third, stealing Wiltshire's horse, and riding away to safety. Ferris was then promoted to the rank of captain on April 21.\\"Black, Robert W. Ghost, Thunderbolt, and Wizard: Mosby, Morgan, and Forrest in the Civil War. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books, 2008. A different account, penned in 1915 by Samuel Scoville, stated that Ferris and the Confederate officer \\"were armed only with sabres\\", and that Ferris gained the element of surprise when he \\"spurred his horse at the guerrilla-leader and suddenly executing a demi-volte which is only effective when performed by a good sabre and a trained horse ... whirled like lightning and caught his opponent such a tremendous back-handed slash that he cut him almost to the saddle.\\" Ferris was then shot in the left thigh just above the knee while fighting off the other two enemy cavalrymen. Grabbing two pistols by unbuckling the officer's pistol belt, according to Scoville, he fired at the second enemy soldier with one hand while using his sabre against the third.Scoville, Jr., Samuel.

A carbon fiber electrode is used to quickly change the voltage to oxidize dopamine and reduce dopamine-O-quinone. The resulting alternating current is used to find the instantaneous concentration of dopamine in the extracellular fluid. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is cyclic voltammetry with a very high scan rate (up to ). Application of high scan rate allows rapid acquisition of a voltammogram within several milliseconds and ensures high temporal resolution of this electroanalytical technique. An acquisition rate of 10 Hz is routinely employed. FSCV in combination with carbon-fiber microelectrodes became a very popular method for detection of neurotransmitters, hormones and metabolites in biological systems. Initially, FSCV was successfully used for detection of electrochemically active biogenic amines release in chromaffin cells (adrenaline and noradrenaline), brain slices (5-HT, dopamine, norepinephrine) and in vivo in anesthetized or awake and behaving animals (dopamine). Further refinements of the method have enabled detection of 5-HT, HA, norepinephrine, adenosine, oxygen, pH changes in vivo in rats and mice as well as measurement of dopamine and serotonin concentration in fruit flies.  Principles of FSCV  In fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), a small carbon fiber electrode (micrometer scale) is inserted into living cells, tissue, or extracellular space. The electrode is then used to quickly raise and lower the voltage in a triangular wave fashion. When the voltage is in the correct range (typically ¬±1 Volt) the compound of interest will be repeatedly oxidized and reduced. This will result in a movement of electrons in solution that will ultimately create a small alternating current (nano amps scale). By subtracting the background current created by the probe from the resulting current, it is possible to generate a voltage vs. current plot that is unique to each compound. Since the time scale of the voltage oscillations is known, this can then be used to calculate a plot of the current in solution as a function of time. The relative concentrations of the compound may be calculated as long as the number of electrons transferred in each oxidation and reduction reaction is known. Fast cyclic voltammetry Advantages such as chemical specificity, high resolution, and noninvasive probes make FSCV a powerful technique for detecting changing chemical concentrations in vivo. The chemical specificity of FSCV is derived from reduction potentials. Every compound has a unique reduction potential, and so the alternating voltage can be set to select for a particular compound. As a result, FSCV can be used to measure a variety of electrically active biological compounds such as catacholamines, indolamines, and neurotransmitters. Concentration changes regarding ascorbic acid, oxygen, nitric oxide, and hydrogen ions (pH) can also be detected. It can even be used to measure multiple compounds at the same time, as long as one has a positive and the other has a negative redox potential. High resolution is achieved by changing the voltage at very high speeds, referred to as a fast scan rate. Scan rates for FSCV are on the sub-second scale, oxidizing and reducing compounds in microseconds. Another advantage of FSCV is its ability to be used in vivo. Typical electrodes consist of small carbon fiber needles that are micrometers in diameter and able to be noninvasively inserted into live tissues. The size of the electrode also permits it to probe very specific brain regions. Thus, FSCV has proved to be effective in measuring chemical fluctuations of living organisms and has been used in conjunction with several behavioral studies. Acceptable voltage and current ranges are common limitations of FSCV. To start, the electric potential must stay within the voltage range of the electrolysis of water (Eo = ¬± 1.23). Additionally, the resulting current must remain low in order to avoid cell lysis as well as cell depolarization. Fast scan cyclic voltammetry is also limited in that it only makes differential measurements; the currents it measures are only relative to the background, so they cannot be used to quantify resting concentrations. This is partially due to the fact that the basal current levels are largely affected by factors such as pH, so over longer periods of time these values tend to drift. The age of the electrode is also important, and probes tend to be less accurate the longer they are used. This technique is also limited to quantifying the concentrations of electrically active compounds, and can only be used with select molecules in biological systems. In spite of this, there have been methods developed to measure levels of non-electric enzymes that have an electroactive substrate. However, in this scenario, the electrode probes are also a limiting factor in the data resolution. When measuring an electroactive substrate, the probe is often coated with its corresponding enzyme. In order to avoid the enzyme interacting with different substrates, the electrode is also coated with a polymer that acts as a selective filter against particular types of ions. However, when this polymer is added it lowers the speed at which the voltage scans can be made and effectively lowers the data resolution.  Applications  = Measurement of dopamine in vivo = FSCV is used to monitor changes in concentration of dopamine in mammalian brain in real time with sensitivity down to 1 nM. Using an acquisition rate of 10 Hz is fast enough to sample dynamics of neurotransmitter release and clearance. Pharmacological action of dopaminergic drugs such as D1 and D2 receptors agonists and antagonist (raclopride, haloperidol), dopamine transporter blockers (cocaine, nomifensine, GBR 12909) could be evaluated with FSCV. The fast acquisition rate also allows the study of dopamine dynamics during behavior. The effects of psychostimulants (cocaine, amphetamine and methamphetamine), opioids (morphine and heroin), cannabinoids, alcohol and nicotine on dopaminergic neurotransmission and development of drug addiction was studied with FSCV. Dopamine is a primary neurotransmitter mediating learning, goal-directing behavior and decision making. Monitoring of dopamine concentration in vivo in behaving animals with FSCV reveals dopamine coding of the brain's decision making process. = Measurement of other monoamine neurotransmitters = FSCV is used to study dynamics of exocytosis of noradrenaline and adrenaline from chromaffin cells; release of serotonin from mast cells; release of 5-HT in brain slices; release of 5-HT in brain of anesthetized rodents and fruit flies; release of norepinephrine in brain of anesthetized and freely moving rodents.

The petition was filed after Bhanwari Devi, a social worker in Rajasthan was brutally gang raped for stopping a child marriage.

The judgment of August 1997 given by a bench of J. S. Verma (then C.J.I)., Sujata Manohar and B. N.

It is seen as a significant legal victory for women's groups in India.http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1031794/http://www.iiap.res.in/files/VisakaVsRajasthan_1997.pdf Background In India, before 1997, there were no formal guidelines for how an incident involving sexual harassment at workplace should be dealt by an employer. Women experiencing sexual harassment at workplace had to lodge a complaint under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code that deals with the 'criminal assault of women to outrage women's modesty' and Section 509 that punishes an individual or individuals for using a 'word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman'. These sections left the interpretation of 'outraging women's modesty' to the discretion of the police officer.http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-explained-vishaka-judgment-on- sexual-harassment-at-workplace-1923309 Bhanwari Devi In 1992 Bhanwari Devi a social worker in Rajasthan was brutally gang raped by a number of gujjar men, because she had tried to stop a child marriage. Bhanwari Devi was determined to get justice and lodged a case against the offenders. However, the accused was acquitted by a trial court. This appalling injustice, together with the fighting spirit of Bhanwari Devi, inspired several women‚Äôs groups and NGOs to file a petition in the Supreme Court under the collective platform of Vishaka. http://www.lawisgreek.com/indian-laws-for-women-the-historic-case- of-vishaka-versus-state-of-rajasthan Aftermath The court decided that the consideration of \\"International Conventions and norms are significant for the purpose of interpretation of the guarantee of gender equality, right to work with human dignity in Articles 14, 15 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution and the safeguards against sexual harassment implicit therein.\\" Supreme Court of India defined sexual harassment and set guidelines for employers.  What is sexual harassment  Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as: a) physical contact and advances; b) a demand or request for sexual favours; c) sexually coloured remarks; d) showing pornography; e) any other unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual NATURE Where any of these acts is committed in circumstances where under the victim of such conduct has a reasonable apprehension that in relation to the victim‚Äôs employment or work whether she is drawing salary, or honorarium or voluntary, whether in government, public or private enterprise such conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem. It is discriminatory for instance when the woman has reasonable grounds to believe that her objection would disadvantage her in connection with her employment or work including recruiting or promotion or when it creates a hostile work environment. Thus, sexual harassment need NOT involve physical contact. Any act that creates a hostile work environment - be it by virtue of cracking lewd jokes, verbal abuse, circulating lewd rumours etc. counts as sexual harassment. The creation of a hostile work environment through unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature may consist not of a single act but of pattern of behaviour comprising many such acts. Thus, it is important that the victim report such behaviour as soon as possible and not wait for it to become worse. In some cases, the psychological stigma of reporting the conduct of a co- worker might require a great deal of courage on the part of the victim and they may report such acts after a long period of time. The guidelines suggest that the complaint mechanism should ensure time bound treatment of complaints, but they do not suggest that a report can only be made within a short period of time since the incident occurred. Often, the police refuse to lodge FIRs for sexual harassment cases, especially where the harassment occurred some time ago.  From guidelines to Act  The Supreme Court of India's judgement only proposed guidelines to alleviate the problem of sexual harassment in 1997. India finally enacted its law on prevention of sexual harassment against female employees at the workplace. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (\\"Sexual Harassment Act\\") has been made effective on 23 April 2013 by way of publication in the Gazette of India via Mondaq.

The cartoon is the eighth to last in the characters' long-running film series. Originally in black-and white, this was one of the eleven Mutt and Jeff cartoons that were redrawn colorized in 1973 by Radio and Television Packagers. Plot Mutt has been selected to judge a dog show. As a scheme, he tells Jeff to participate, assuring the latter will come out the victor. Later when the dog show is about to begin, Jeff puts on a dog suit before entering. At the contest, Mutt observes the other dogs. Mutt then approaches Jeff whom he momentarily declares the winner. This provoked great envy from the other dogs as they chase Jeff out of the scene. Mutt also runs to save his buddy. Moments after being pursued, Jeff manages to lure the dogs into the container of a horse- drawn carriage. While he tries to get away, the carriage's driver catches and tosses him inside too. The carriage arrives at a sausage plant. The driver then inserts the dogs through an opening on the plant's wall where they slide into a machine which turns them into sausages. Not wanting to share their fate, Jeff tries his best to avoid dropping in. After some trouble with a broom-wielding worker, Jeff partially falls into the machine. Fortunately, he is able to get off, and only his dog suit gets devoured. Meanwhile, Mutt eventually finds and enters the carriage. As a consequence, the driver, thinking there is one more dog left, obliviously passes Mutt into the machine. Mutt somehow gets stuck midway with legs sticking out. Jeff then pulls out his buddy, until they drop through the opening. When they are outside, Jeff notices Mutt's disfigured body, and laughs. Annoyed by this, Mutt pounds and knocks out Jeff.

Currently, this empirical law is applied in neuromodulation for development of implants for cortical, cochlear, retinal, and deep brain stimulation. Shannon categorizes the relationship between stimulating electrode and target neural tissue as either Near Field, Mid Field, or Far Field, and discusses how equation parameters may be chosen in each case. In the case of spinal cord stimulation, for example, the Far Field category would apply. Limitations The data on which the Shannon model was built are restricted to experiments performed in cat cerebral cortex with 7 hours of stimulation under light anesthesia at 50 pps with 400 ¬µs pulses (charge- balanced, symmetric, biphasic, anodic-first) using platinum surface disc electrodes of 1 mm¬≤ or larger, recessed, anodized sintered tantalum-tantalum pentoxide pellet electrodes of 1 mm in diameter, or iridium penetrating microelectrodes of 6500 ¬µm¬≤. As a result of these restricted methods, Shannon states \\"A more comprehensive model of safe levels for electrical stimulation would also account for the effects of pulse rate, pulse duration, stimulus duty cycle, and duration of exposure.\\" Additionally, further study has demonstrated that microelectrodes do not obey the Shannon criterion, and new approaches may be proposed to address these limitations.

FASTAR automatically reroutes circuits over a spare protection capacity when a fiber- optic cable failure is detected, hence increasing service availability and reducing the impact of the outages in the network. Similar in operation is real-time restoration (RTR), developed and deployed by MCI and used in the MCI network to minimize the effects of a fiber cut.Real-Time Restoration  Restoration techniques  It is a recovery technique used in computer networks and telecommunication networks such as mesh optical networks, where the backup path (the alternate path that affected traffic takes after a failure condition) and backup channel are computed in real time after the occurrence of a failure. This technique can be broadly classified into two: centralized restoration and distributed restoration.Path Routing in Mesh Optical Networks\\", by Eric Bouillet, Georgios Ellinas, Jean-Francois Labourdette, and Ramu Ramamurthy = Centralized restoration techniques = This technique uses a central controller which has access to complete up-to-date and accurate information about the network, the available resources, resources used, the physical topology of the network, the service demands etc. When failure is detected in any part of the network through some failure detection, identification and notification scheme, the central controller calculates a new re-route path around the failure based on the information in its database about the current state of the network. After this new route (backup path) is calculated, the central controller sends out commands to all the affected digital cross-connects to make appropriate reconfigurations to their switching elements in order to implement this new path. FASTAR and RTR restoration systems are examples of systems that use this restoration technique. = Distributed restoration techniques = In this restoration technique, no central controller is used, hence no up-to-date database of the state of the network is needed. In this scheme, all nodes in the network use local controllers that have only local information about how a particular node is connected to its neighboring nodes, available and spare capacity on the links used to connect to neighbors, and the state of their switching elements. When a failure occurs in any part of the network, the local controllers handle the computation and re-routing of the affected traffic. An example of an approach where this technique is used is the Self-Healing Networks (SHN).  Recovery architecture evolution  As the transport networks gradually developed from digital cross connect system (DCS)-based mesh networks, to SONET ring networks, and to optical mesh networks over the years, so did the recovery architecture used therein. The recovery architectures used for the different transport networks are: DCS-based mesh networks restoration of DS3 facilities, Add-Drop Multiplexer (ADM)-based ring protection of SONET ring networks, and finally Optical Cross Connect (OXC)-based mixed protection and restoration of optical mesh networks = DCS-based mesh restoration = The first restoration architecture which was used in the 1980s is the DCS-based mesh restoration of DS3 facilities. This architecture used a centralized restoration technique: every restoration event was coordinated from the network operation center (NOC). This restoration architecture is path-based and failure dependent, and is used after a fault occurs, for fault detection and isolation. This architecture is capacity-efficient due to the use of stub release but has a slow failure recovery time (the time it takes to reestablish traffic continuity after a failure by rerouting the signals on diverse facilities) on the order of minutes. = ADM-based ring protection = This architecture was implemented in the 1990s with the introduction of the SONET/SDH networks, and employed the distributed protection technique. It uses either path-based (UPSR) or span-based (BLSR) protection, and its recovery path is precomputed before the occurrence of a failure. ADM-based ring protection is capacity- inefficient, unlike the DCS-based mesh restoration, but has a faster recovery time (50 ms). = OXC-based protection of optical mesh networks = This recovery architecture is used in the protection of optical mesh networks which was introduced in early 2000s. This protection architecture has a recovery time between tens and hundreds of milliseconds which is a significant improvement over the recovery time supported in DCS-based mesh restoration but unlike the DCS-based mesh restoration, its recovery path is predetermined and pre-provisioned. This architecture also has the capacity efficiency seen in the preceding mesh restoration architecture (DCS-based).  FASTAR architecture  FASTAR uses DCS-based mesh restoration architecture. This architecture consists of nodal equipment, central control equipment, and a data communication network interconnecting the nodes to the central controller. The figure on the right explains the architecture of FASTAR and how the different building blocks interact. Architecture of FASTAR = Central equipments = The central processor called the Restoration and Provisioning Integrated Design (RAPID) located at the NOCNext Generation Transport Networks: Data, Management, and Control Planes by Manohar, N. E.; Steven S. G.; Lakshmi G. R.; Wayne D. G. is responsible for receiving and analyzing alarm reports generated in the event of a fiber failure. it also handles alternate (backup) route computation, re-routing of the affected traffic from the primary path to the already computed backup path, path assurance tests, and enables the roll-back of traffic to the original path after the failure is repaired.Chao, C-W; Dollard, P.

The Traffic Maintenance and Administration System (TMAS) enables RAPID to perform and control the protection switch lock-out process on protection channels being used for restoration, by sending commands to the Line Terminating Equipment (LTE). = Nodal equipment = The Restoration Network Controllers (RNCs) are located at each central office (CO) in the fiber optic network. The alarms generated by the affected digital access and cross-connect system (DACSs) or from the LTE are sent to the RNC, where it is aged to find out if the alarm is as a result of a transient, correlated and finally sent to the RAPID via the data communication network. The LTE, which is either FT Series G digital transmission system or an add drop multiplexer (ADM), reports any fiber failure between LTEs to the RNC and also provides RAPID with immediate access to the backup channels for re-routing of traffic or path assurance tests. The Restoration Test Equipment (RTE) provides RAPID with the means to perform continuity tests used in path assurance. The DACS is responsible for reporting fiber failures and node failures that occur within the office to the RNC. In addition, the DACS enables automatic restoration by providing the central processor access to remotely perform cross-connects at the DS-3 level. = Data communication network = The data communication network is used to connect the nodal equipments with the central controller. To achieve the needed availability of this network, full redundancy is used in the form of two totally diverse terrestrial and satellite-based networks. In an event of a major restoration process, one of these networks can support the communication burden in the absence of the other.  Restoration using FASTAR  17-node DS3 transport network with traffic from node A to node Q before failure Traffic from node A to node Q via C, F, K, and L is rerouted by FASTAR through nodes: C, D and E FASTAR operates at the DS-3 level; it does not restore individual smaller demands.Optimizing Restoration Capacity in the AT&T; Network by Cwilich S., Deng M. , Houck D.J. , Lynch D.F., Ken, A.,Yan, D. FASTAR restores 90 to 95 percent of the affected DS-3 demand within two to three minutes.AT&T; Best Practices-Network Continuity Overview When a fiber- optic cut occurs between the output of a DACS equipment and the input of another, each RNC collects alarms from the affected LTEs. The RNC ages these alarms and sends it to RAPID. RAPID determines the amount of spare capacity available after this failure, identifies the DS-3 demands affected, finds the restoration route for each affected traffic in sequential order of priority, and sends a command to the appropriate DACSs to implement the re-route, thus establishing a restoration. In the figure on the right, a route exists between node A and node Q via nodes C, F, K, and L. In the event of a fiber-optic cable failure between nodes F and K, the LTE (FT Series G or the ADM) in these two offices detects and sends alarm reports for this failure to their respective RNCs. Both RNCs age the alarm and send these reports to RAPID, located at the NOC. RAPID initiates a time window to ensure all related alarms generated from the RNCs of the affected nodes and the RNC of any other office whose traffic uses the F to K failed fiber optic cable. When this window times out, RAPID performs route computation, to establish a new backup path for the traffic between node A and node Q. Here it creates a new route through C, F, G, J, K, and L. This route computation is also done sequentially in order of priority for all the traffic between any two nodes in the network that use the same failed fiber-optic cable. Once the backup path for all the traffic going through nodes F and K has been computed, RAPID ensures that there is continuity or connectivity along the established back-up paths by sending a command to the RNCs located at A and Q, both of which in turn use the test signal generated by their respective RTE to check for continuity in the link. When the connectivity of this backup path has been verified, the traffic between nodes A and Q is transferred to this backup path by commanding the DACS IIIs to make the appropriate cross connections. RAPID performs a service verification test to verify that the service transfer was successful. If this test returns a positive result, then the service transfer was successful, else the service transfer was unsuccessful and needs to be repeated. This service or traffic transfer process is performed for all the traffic going through the affected fiber optic cable F‚ÄìK. FASTAR restores as much of the affected traffic demand as the available protection capacity will allow.  Restoring networks with SRLGs using FASTAR  Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) refer to situations where links that connect two distinct nodes or offices in a network share a common conduit. In that configuration, links in the group have a shared risk: if one link fails, other links in the group may fail too. Majority of the networks in use today use SRLGs, as most times, the only access into a building or across a bridge is only through a single conduit. To restore the traffic in a link between two offices or nodes that share the same SRLG with other links in the event of a conduit cut, at least one of these two offices must be FASTAR-ompliant.operations in the real AT&T; transport network by Bums H.S., Chao C.W., Dollard P.M., Mallon R.E., Eslambolchi H., Wolfmeyer P.A. { Example of SRLGs between offices A, B and C Failure of SRLG2 between office B and C Failure of SRLG1 between office A and B } A cut in SRLG1 would be restorable using FASTAR if FASTAR is implemented in either office A or B but B and C were not yet FASTAR-compliant. But given a failure in SRLG2, the DS-3 traffic on link 3 would be restored by FASTAR via a newly re-computed backup path while the DS-3 traffic on link 2 would not be restored as FASTAR is not implemented in either office B or C. To restore all three links in the event of failure of both SRLGs, FASTAR is implemented in offices A and C. A failure in SRLG1 would cause FASTAR to automatically re-route each of the traffic on link 1 and 3 via two re-computed backup paths. Also if at another time failure of SRLG2 is detected, it is reported to RAPID and the traffic through link 2 and 3 are each re-routed through a new backup path.  FASTAR network management  Overview of the RNC-EMS process and communications FASTAR network management is used to integrate and analyze the different data and alarms supplied by the various system elements that make up the FASTAR architecture for centralized display, and to troubleshoot and isolate problems through fault management analysis so that corrective action can be taken. The FASTAR network management cuts across three tiers. # The first (lowest) tier consists of all the elements that constitute the FASTAR architecture, and all the interconnecting links between them. # The second tier consists of Element Management Systems (EMSs) which are computerized operations systems (OSs) used to manage the elements that are in the first tier. The different EMSs are collectively called FASTAR Element Management Systems (FASTEMS). The two major FASTEMS are the DACS Element Management Systems (DEMS) and the RNC Element Management Systems (RNC-EMS). DEMS is designed to assist NOC with management of DACSs. In the event of a change in the status of the network due to a fiber failure, RAPID forwards this status change to DEMS, which triggers DEMS to isolate the problem. The RNC-EMS monitors the RNCs directly via the data communication network and indirectly monitors the RTE, LTE, and DASC III, and their links to the RNC, via agents residing in the RNC. It consists two components: the manager and the agent. The manager software daemon (NMd) runs on the RNC-EMS machine and is responsible for polling the RNCs. Every RNC is polled twice, once over each of the data communication networks. The agent software daemon (NAd) runs on every RNC as part of the application software. It accesses the RNC application log to respond to manager queries, and has the ability to send autonomous alarms to the manager. # The third (highest) tier comprises only the CADS workstation and provides centralized access to the network manager via the lower two tiers.

Yancy was the sixth typhoon of the annual typhoon season and sixth tropical cyclone overall to impact Japan that year. Developing out of an area of disturbed weather in the open northwest Pacific on August 29, 1993, the precursor to Yancy tracked westward and quickly intensified to reach tropical storm strength on August 30\\\\. Just two days later, the tropical storm reached typhoon intensity as it recurved towards the northeast. A period of rapid intensification followed, allowing Yancy to quickly reach super typhoon intensity. The strong tropical cyclone reached peak intensity on September 2 with maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). The following day Yancy made its first landfall on I≈çjima at nearly the same strength; over the course of the day the typhoon would make three subsequent landfalls on Japanese islands. Land interaction forced the tropical cyclone to weaken, and after its final landfall on Hiroshima Prefecture, Yancy weakened below typhoon intensity. After emerging into the Sea of Japan, Yancy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone; these remnants persisted as they meandered in the sea before dissipating completely on September 7\\\\. Meteorological history In late August, an area of convection began to persist in the open northwestern Pacific, well removed from any landmasses. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor the disturbance at 1200 UTC on August 27. Aided by a southwesterly monsoonal wind flow and in an area of favorable conditions, the system organized, and at 0600 UTC on August 28, the JTWC issued a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory on the disturbance. Organization continued throughout the day's course, and the system was classified by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on August 29. Shower activity at that time began to coalesce more closely around the system's center of circulation, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert an hour later. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the agency also reclassified the system as a tropical depression at 0600 UTC that day. At the time, the depression was positioned roughly northwest of Guam. Through tropical cyclogenesis, the primitive depression tracked westward, in the direction of Taiwan. At 0000 UTC on August 30, the JMA upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity, followed by the JTWC six hours later based on a ship report in the vicinity of the cyclone. Yancy making landfall on Kyushu on September 3 Yancy continued to gradually intensify, and according to the JMA the storm reached severe tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on August 31. By this time, Yancy started to curve towards the northwest. Later that day, the tropical storm began developing a banding eye feature. This was reflected in satellite intensity estimates, prompting the JTWC to upgrade Yancy to typhoon status. The JMA maintained the storm's severe tropical storm status through this period, though on September 1 the agency initiated 3-hour position fixes in contrast to their usual 6-hour fix procedure; at 0300 UTC that day the JMA upgraded Yancy to typhoon intensity. Upon upgrade, Yancy was estimated to have a minimum barometric pressure of 965 mbar (hPa; 28.50 inHg). At the time the typhoon was positioned approximately south-southwest of Okinawa. Rapid intensification ensued, and just nine hours later the JTWC estimated Yancy's winds to have equated to that of a Category 3 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. The JTWC upgraded the typhoon to super typhoon status at 0600 UTC on September 3 as one-minute sustained winds were estimated to have reached the threshold of 130 kt (240 km/h, 150 mph). Three hours later the JMA estimated Yancy to have peaked in strength with ten-minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925 mbar (hPa; 27.32 inHg); this intensity would be held for the following 18 hours. Only minimal weakening occurred in the immediate hours following peak intensity, and at around 0600 UTC on September 3, Yancy passed directly over I≈çjima. Tracking rapidly northeastward at around 40 km/h (25 mph), Yancy made a second landfall on Kagoshima Prefecture within an hour later at the same intensity; at the time this made Yancy the strongest tropical cyclone ever to make landfall on Japan since Typhoon Shirley in 1965, 28 years prior. Land interaction with Kyushu further weakened Yancy, but the system remained at typhoon intensity upon its landfall on western Ehime Prefecture at around 1400 UTC that day. The JTWC estimated that the typhoon was still maintaining Category 3 intensity upon landfall on Ehime. This particular landfall greatly weakened Yancy, and despite the storm briefly emerging over intra-insular waters, was only a minimal typhoon by the time of its final landfall on Hiroshima Prefecture at 1600 UTC that day. Shortly following the tropical cyclone's final landfall, Yancy weakened below typhoon intensity to severe tropical storm classification. Continuing to track northeast, the weakening cyclone underwent extratropical transition and was assessed to have fully transitioned into an extratropical storm by 1200 UTC on September 4 while located in the northeastern Sea of Japan. Yancy's extratropical remnants persisted for several days as they meandered within the Sea of Japan before dissipating by 1200 UTC on September 7. Preparations In preparation for Typhoon Yancy, bus and rail services in potentially affected areas were halted. Some schools were also closed. Though no initial evacuation orders were made, caution was advised to people living in Kyushu. Forecasts prior to Yancy's landfalls on Japan raised fears that the storm would be one of the strongest in the past 50 years to strike the country. In Okinawa, 15,000 passengers were stranded after most flights arriving and departing from the island were cancelled by airlines. An additional 330 domestic flights were cancelled across western Japan, stranding 5,600 persons. As Yancy neared the country, approximately 4,600 people were forced to evacuate from flood and landslide-prone areas of Kagoshima. Pop star Michael Jackson postponed a scheduled performance in Taiwan, potentially as a result of Typhoon Yancy. However, these claims were denied by his tour promoters and associated staff. Impact and aftermath Enlarged track of Typhoon Yancy between September 2 and September 4 depicting the storm's path in relation to several Northwest Pacific islands. Upon Yancy's first landfall on Japan, the tropical cyclone became the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the country in over three decades. Across Japan, a total of 10,447 homes were inundated, with 1,892 other homes suffering complete destruction. Yancy killed 48 people and injured 266 others. Most of the deaths were the result of widespread flooding and landslides. Overall, damage costs in Japan as a result of Yancy reached ¬•175.5 billion (US$1.67 billion). Unadjusted for inflation, this would have at the time made Yancy the third costliest tropical cyclone in Japanese history, only behind Typhoon Bess in 1982 and Typhoon Mireille in 1991. Insured losses from Yancy in Japan reached ¬•97.7 billion (US$928 million). As a result of precautionary measures taken during the course of Yancy's trek through the country, at least 245,000 rail passengers and 15,000 airline passengers became stranded. Yancy's potential impacts were exacerbated by the impacts of Typhoon Robyn in mid-August and significant rainstorms a week prior to Yancy's landfall. In the direct aftermath of Typhoon Yancy, personnel from the Japan Self-Defense Forces were dispatched to rescue victims of the typhoon and recover dead bodies. =Ryukyu Islands= Passing within 110 km (70 mi) of Okinawa Island on September 2, Yancy brought gusty winds to the island. At Kadena Air Base, sustained winds reached as high as 88 km/h (55 mph), with gusts peaking at 142 km/h (89 mph). Rainfall on the island peaked at 397 mm (15.70 in) in Gusuku. The same station observed 360 mm (14.17 in) of rain over a 24-hour period. Of all islands in Okinawa Prefecture, Kume Island sustained the worst impacts from Yancy. The eye of the typhoon passed directly over the island, resulting in a station observing a record low barometric pressure of 928 mbar (hPa; 27.41 inHg). The same station also clocked a wind gust at 194 km/h (120 mph). Large swaths of sugarcane crops were damaged. On the coast, strong waves damaged fishing boats and ports. One person who went missing on the coast was later found dead. Strong winds inland unroofed buildings and toppled power lines. Twenty-two buildings were completely destroyed, with an additional 516 sustaining at least partial damage. Total damage costs on Kume and Naha islands amounted to ¬•1.8 billion (US$17.3 million), and two people were killed. Heavy agricultural damage also occurred on Ishigaki Island. Sugarcane crops were severely impacted, with losses reaching ¬•35 million (US$330,000) and accounting for approximately 80.5% of all sugarcane crops on the island. Significant damage was also inflicted on other fruit and vegetable crops. Total agricultural losses on Ishigaki reached ¬•43.6 million (US$410,000). On nearby Taketomi Island, similar agricultural damage ensued. To the east, the Miyako Islands also suffered extensive damage. Heavy rainfall triggered widespread flooding, which took a toll on infrastructure and agriculture. Ten buildings sustained at least partial damage, with one completely demolished. In addition, three dikes were breached by floodwater. Roughly 4,478 ha (11,065 ac) of farmland were damaged. Agricultural damage there amounted to ¬•309 million (US$2.9 million). =Kyushu= Kyushu was the first of Japan's four main islands to be impacted by Yancy and suffered the worst effects as a result. Floods and power outages were widespread, with about 700,000 homes on the island without power at one point. Kagoshima Prefecture was the location of the typhoon's first and second landfalls and as such major damage occurred there. Rainfall in the prefecture peaked at 375 mm (14.76 in) in Takatoge. However, higher hourly rainfall rates were reported at stations in Mizobe and Makurazaki. Off the coast, strong storm surge was reported, resulting in damage along the coast. In Sata, waves were estimated to be 11.5 m (37.7 ft) high. Widespread flash floods and landslides were commonplace across Kagoshima. Nine people were killed in a single landslide incident. Another landslide in Kinpo, Kagoshima trapped 20 people. In Kawanabe, a single mudslide killed nine persons and destroyed 20 homes. A total of 31 landslides occurred throughout Kaghsima. Widespread power outages also took place, which affected 384,000 houses. Prefecture-wide, 209 homes were demolished and 626 sustained partial damage. Overall, damage costs in Kagoshima amounted to ¬•43.9 billion (US$420 million), and 33 lives were lost. An additional 163 persons were injured. Despite not being a point of landfall, Miyazaki Prefecture was the most severely affected region of Japan. Many of the highest rainfall totals recorded in Japan took place in Miyazaki Prefecture. A weather station in Mitate, located in the town of Hinokage, observed 577 mm (22.72 in) of rain, far more than any other station in the country. The same station reported 543 mm (21.38 in) of its rainfall total in a 24-hour period, which still exceeded the storm totals of any other Japanese weather station. High storm surge generated by Yancy caused coastal inundation in Hy≈´ga, which flooded the first floors of many buildings. Several fishing boats in a harbor off of Nobeaka capsized due to wave action. River swelling caused by heavy precipitation and flooding washed away four bridges prefecture-wide. Further inland many homes were unroofed as a result of strong winds. A total of 347 homes were damaged, and of those 38 were destroyed. Overall damage totaled ¬•88.8 billion (US$840 million), primarily as a result of agricultural loss, and two people were killed. Northern Kyushu Damage in Kumamoto Prefecture was considerably less in comparison with Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures but nonetheless remained significant. Winds gusting as high as 94 km/h (58 mph) resulted in the destruction of several homes. The strong winds also toppled and uprooted numerous trees, including a patch of trees 1,670 ha (4,130 ac) in area in the southern portion of the prefecture. Landslides were also commonplace, blocking homes and destroying additional buildings. Damage in the prefecture reached ¬•30.5 billion (US$290 million), primarily to forestry, where damage in that sector alone totaled ¬•21 billion ($200 million). One person in Kumamoto Prefecture was killed after a falling incident while five others were injured. ≈åita Prefecture was primarily impacted by heavy rainfall from Yancy, resulting in widespread flooding. Precipitation peaked at 422 mm (16.61 in) in ≈åita, the second highest rainfall amount in Japan. Four people were killed after two buildings collapsed as a result of an overflowing river. Another person was killed due to a flood- triggered landslide. The floods destroyed 28 homes and inundated another 302 across ≈åita. In addition to residential damage, the floods inundated large swaths of agricultural land, leading to soil erosion. Crops, in particularly pears, were greatly affected. Approximately 1,074 ha (2,654 ac) of arable land was eroded. Across the prefecture, agricultural damage amounted to ¬•26.8 billion (US$250 million). The floods also caused widespread clean water shortages, particularly in Kusu District. Overall, damage caused by Yancy in ≈åita Prefecture was estimated at ¬•42.4 billion (US$402 million), and seven people were killed. Nagasaki, Saga, and Fukuoka prefectures were less affected by Yancy relative to other regions in Kyushu. Nagasaki Prefecture was primarily impacted by the typhoon's storm surge. Wave heights peaked at off of Miiraki. The wave action caused some coastal damage. Further inland, damage lessened, and limited to a single landslide. Damage in Nagasaki totaled ¬•1.7 billion (US$16 million). In Saga, excessive rainfall caused widespread crop damage and suspended various transportation services. Damage estimates in Saga were slightly less than in Nagasaki, totaling ¬•1.6 billion (US$15 million). Flooding in Fukuoka Prefecture resulted in two landslides and destroyed four buildings. Eighty-nine other buildings were inundated by floodwater. Damage there totaled ¬•2.4 billion (US$23 million), and one person was killed. =Shikoku= Shikoku was the second of Japan's four main islands that Yancy made landfall on. Ehime Prefecture in Shikoku was the site of Yancy's third landfall. A high storm surge swamped coastal regions, damaging fishing boats and other shoreline structures. A total of 33 boats were reportedly damaged. Heavy rainfall blocked roads, flooded buildings, and triggered landslides. Inundation was reported in 1,237 buildings prefecture wide. Twelve landslides occurred, and dikes were breached in 13 locations. Power outage also occurred in earnest in Ehime Prefecture, with as many as 37,300 households losing electricity at one point. Two people were killed, and five others were injured. Damage in Ehime as a result of Yancy totaled ¬•4.7 billion (US$44 million). Damage was much more considerable in K≈çchi Prefecture, where damage totaled ¬•5 billion (US$48 million). Rainfall peaked at 384 mm (15.12 in) in Funato; this was the highest rainfall total on Shikoku Island.

Married people experience lower morbidity and mortality across such diverse health threats as cancer, heart attacks, and surgery. There are gender differences in these effects which may be partially due to men's and women's relative status. Most research on marriage and health has focused on heterosexual couples, and more work is needed to clarify the health effects on same-sex marriage. Simply being married, as well as the quality of one's marriage, has been linked to diverse measures of health. Research has examined the social-cognitive, emotional, behavioral and biological processes involved in these links. Compared to other relationships Beyond marriage, social relationships more broadly have a powerful impact on health. A meta-analysis of 148 studies found that those with stronger social relationships had a 50% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Conversely, loneliness is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. Little work has directly compared the health impacts of marriage compared to those of non-romantic relationships, such as connections with friends or colleagues. However, there are several reasons why marriage may exert a greater health impact than other relationships, even other cohabiting relationships: married couples spend time together during a wide variety of activities, such as eating, leisure, housekeeping, child-care and sleep. Spouses also share resources and investments such as joint finances or home-ownership. Relative to other relationships, the increased interdependence of marriage serves as a source for more intense support. Romantic couples who live together, but are unmarried, may represent a middle ground in health benefits between those who are married, and those who self-identify as single. However, people live together without getting married for many different reasons; cohabitation may serve as a prelude to marriage. Selection factors of race, ethnicity, and social-economic status predispose certain groups to cohabit unmarried, and these factors also affect the health benefits of marriage and cohabitation. Same-sex marriage Most research on marriage and health has studied heterosexual couples. Same-sex and opposite-sex couples share many similarities. Both begin marriage with high levels of relationship satisfaction, followed by later declines, and both argue with similar frequency about similar issues. However, same-sex couples resolve conflicts more effectively, and distribute household labor more fairly compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Same-sex marriage remains illegal in many countries, and in many parts of the United States (where much research on marriage and health has been conducted). In these regions same-sex couples are not granted the institutional protections of marriage or its accompanying legal barriers to relationship dissolution. Moreover, same-sex couples are more likely to experience discrimination against their sexual orientation, contributing to problems with mental health and relationship quality. Gender differences The health-protective effect of marriage is stronger for men than women. Marital status ‚Äî the simple fact of being married ‚Äî confers more health benefits to men than women. Women's health is more strongly impacted than men's by marital conflict or satisfaction, such that unhappily married women do not enjoy better health relative to their single counterparts. Laboratory studies indicate that women have stronger physiological reactions than men in response to marital conflict. These gender differences may be partially due to men's and women's relative status in a relationship. Research in humans and animals suggests subordinate status is linked to greater physiological reactions to social stress. Indeed, subordinate spouses show greater physiological reactions to arguments with their partner. Both husbands and wives show stronger physiological reactions to arguments when making demands for change from their partner. Women's heightened physiological reactions to marital conflict may be due to their relative subordinate position in marriage. Measuring health Research on the links between marriage and health has measured diverse outcomes. These are broadly categorized as clinical endpoints, surrogate endpoints, and biological mediators. Clinical endpoints are variables which affect how people feel, function, and survive. They are recognized as important outcomes by health care providers and patients, for instance being hospitalized, or having a heart-attack. Surrogate endpoints and biological mediators are types of biomarkers‚Äîobjective indicators of normal or pathological physiological processes. Surrogate endpoints serve to substitute for clinical endpoints. They are expected to predict clinical endpoints, based on scientific evidence. For example, elevated blood pressure has been found to predict cardiovascular disease. Biological mediators reflect short-term sources of stress which affect health outcomes through repeated or persistent activation. These processes do not have a sufficient evidence base linking them to clinical endpoints in order be elevated to the class of surrogate endpoints. Examples include changes in hormone levels, or immune measures. Links to health =Selection and protection= The health benefits of marriage are a result of both selection and protection effects. People with better health, more resources, and less stress are more likely to marry, and marriage brings resources, and social support. The health benefits of marriage persist even after controlling for selection effects, indicating that being married is protective of health. =Social support: two models= Research on marriage and health is part of the broader study of the benefits of social relationships. Social ties provide people with a sense of identity, purpose, belonging and support. Two main models describe how social support influences health. The main-effects model proposes that social support is good for one's health, regardless of whether or not one is under stress. The stress-buffering model proposes that social support acts as a buffer against the negative effects of stress occurring outside the relationship. Both models have received empirical support, depending on how social support is conceptualized and measured. Marriage should be a strong source of social support in both models. = Observed social dynamics of couples = There are several interesting social norms between couples that are relevant towards forming health-related habits. Couples have a higher chance of accomplishing a goal when they collaborate, as opposed to achieving the same goal as individuals. In addition, couples' habits play an important role in influencing the health habits of their children. As a result, shared activities among couples can help develop stronger relationships that can lead to other health and long- term benefits. There are several interesting social norms between couples that are relevant towards forming health-related habits. Examples include: * Eating Dynamics: Couples like to eat together, and although they perform divergent activities during the day, they often 'come together and look forward to dinner'.Craig, P. L. and Truswell, A. S. (1988a) Dynamics of food habits of newly married couples: food related activities and attitudes towards food. In Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, 1. In addition, couples have an affinity to grocery-shop together, which is an important opportunity to make household decisions towards healthy eating. * Reduced Exercise Patterns: Time constraints and other obligations often deter couples from regularly exercising. In particular, their stable relationships often propel them to \\"let go\\" and be less concerned about their physique.Jeffery R. W., Rick A.M. (2002). Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between body mass index and marriage-related factors. In Obesity Research '02; 8/10. In societies with strong conformist dynamics, some partners are less likely to exercise unless they go with a companion.Burke, V., Mori, T. A., Giangiulio, N., Gillam, H. F., Beilin, L. J., Houghton, S., Cutt, H. E., Mansour, J., & Wilson, A. (2002). An innovative program for changing health behaviours. In Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 11, S586- S597. * Re-evaluation of Attitudes Towards Health: As couples adopt to new lifestyles, they concurrently re- assess their current attitudes towards health. In this crucial phase, partners are more likely to integrate new knowledge and practical skills towards a health-related lifestyles. * Encouragement and Praise vs. Criticism and Nagging: Verbal support from a spouse, such as encouragement and praise, helps improve physical activity achievement, whereas support disguised as \\"criticism\\" and nagging are often detrimental. * Comparison Anxiety: Anecdotal accounts provide hints on the detrimental effects of comparing exercise progress. Couples may have different rates of progress, and for some partners, comparisons could lead to discouragement. A more collaborative approach towards a unified goal has been found to be more beneficial. = Spousal adherence to fitness programs = There exists several studies specifically examining the effect of spousal engagement on exercise program adherence. For example, one study examined healthy couples' behavior based on a 12-month fitness program where researchers tracked the behaviors between 30 married- singles vs. 32 married pairs. Their results reveal statistically significant differences: at the end of the study, 6.3% of the married-pairs had dropped out of the program, compared to 43% of the married singles. These findings are consistent with previous research, and they point to the notion that social support in the form of \\"spousal participation\\" exerts beneficial effect on adherence towards fitness programs, or in general, most types of health- related joint endeavor. Marital quality While simply being married is associated on average with better health, the health impacts of marriage are affected by marital quality. High marital quality is typically characterized as high self-reported satisfaction with the relationship, generally positive attitudes toward one's spouse, and low levels of hostile and negative behavior. Conversely, low marital quality is characterized as low self- reported satisfaction with the relationship, generally negative attitudes toward one's spouse, and high levels of hostile and negative behavior. A troubled marriage is a significant source of stress, and limits one's ability to seek support from other relationships. Unmarried people are, on average, happier than those unhappily married. A meta-analysis of 126 studies found that greater marital quality is related to better health, with effect sizes comparable to those of health behaviors such as diet and exercise. Explanations for the links between marital quality and health focus on social- cognitive and emotional processes, health behaviors, and a bidirectional association with mental illness. =Social-cognitive processes= People in happy marriages may think about their relationship differently from people in troubled marriages. Unhappily married people often hold their partner responsible for negative behaviors, but attribute positive behavior to other factors‚Äîfor example, \\"she came home late because she doesn't want to spend time with me; she came home early because her boss told her to.\\" Blaming one's partner for their negative behavior is associated with prolonged elevations of the stress hormone cortisol after an argument. Spouses in troubled marriages are also likely to misattribute their partners' communication as criticism. However, the links between these social-cognitive processes and health remain understudied. =Emotional processes= Higher levels of negative emotions and less effective emotional disclosure may be involved in linking marital quality and health. People in troubled marriages experience more negative emotions, particularly hostility. Negative emotions have been linked to elevated blood pressure and heart rate, and to increased levels of stress hormones, which may lead to ill health. Emotional disclosure often occurs in well-functioning marriages, and is linked to a host of health benefits, including fewer physician visits and missed work days. However, people in troubled marriages are less skillful in emotional disclosure. =Health behaviors= Health behaviors such as diet, exercise and substance use, may also affect the interplay of marital quality and health. The health behaviors of married couples converge over time, such that couples who have been married many years have similar behavior. One explanation is that spouses influence or control one another's health behaviors. A spouse's positive control techniques, such as modeling a healthy behavior, increase their partner's intentions to improve health behaviors, whereas negative control techniques, such as inducing fear, do not affect intentions. Marital support may increase the psychological resources‚Äîsuch as self-efficacy, and self-regulation‚Äîneeded to improve one's health behaviors. =Mental illness= Marital problems predict the onset of mental illness, including anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders. Much research has focused on depression, showing a bidirectional connection with marital conflict. Marital distress interacts with existing susceptibility, increasing risk for depression. Conversely, depressive behavior such as excessive reassurance-seeking can be burdensome for one's spouse, who may respond with criticism or rejection. The links between depression and ill health are well established; depression is associated with immune system dysregulation, and poor health behaviors, such as lack of exercise, poor sleep and diet, and increased substance abuse. =Biological pathways= Dysregulation of the cardiovascular, neuroendocrine and immune systems is implicated in the links between marital quality and health. Cardiovascular reactivity Marital conflict, and seeking change from one's spouse evokes a cardiovascular reaction, increasing heart rate and blood pressure. Couples who are more hostile during arguments have stronger cardiovascular reactions. Heightened cardiovascular reactions are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Neuroendocrine system Hormones produced by the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis (SAM) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) have wide-ranging effects across the body. Both axes have been implicated in the links between psychological factors and physical health. SAM activity can be measured by levels of circulating catecholamines‚Äîepinephrine and norepinephrine. Negative interactions with one's spouse have been linked to elevated catecholamine levels, both during and after conflict. Daily fluctuations in the level of cortisol‚Äîa stress hormone‚Äîare an important marker of health; flatter slopes of cortisol change throughout the day are strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and related mortality. Lower marital satisfaction has been linked with flatter cortisol slopes across the day, lower waking levels of cortisol, and higher overall cortisol levels. However a meta-analysis found no relationship between marital quality and cortisol slopes. Immune pathways Low marital satisfaction, and hostility during arguments with one's spouse are associated with increased inflammation. Inflammation is part of a healthy response to injury and infection, however chronic and persistent inflammation damages the surrounding tissue. Chronic inflammation is implicated as a central mechanism linking psychosocial factors and diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer. Beyond inflammation, lower marital quality is also related to poorer functioning of the adaptive immune system. Marital dissatisfaction and hostility during arguments with one's spouse are related to poorer ability to control the Epstein-Barr virus, a latent virus which infects most adults.

It was built by a ruler of the Despotate of Epirus, and was one of three castles which defended the island before the Venetian era (1401‚Äì1797). The three castles formed a defensive triangle, with Gardiki guarding the island's south, Kassiopi Castle the northeast and Angelokastro the northwest Origins and location Detail of one of the towers of the castle The castle dates from the thirteenth century and is located on a low hill near the village of Agios Matthaios which is situated at a higher elevation. The ruler responsible for the construction of the castle is not known, but it is assumed that it was built either by Michael I Komnenos or his son Michael II Komnenos, rulers of the Despotate of Epirus. Immediately to the south of the castle lies Korissia Lake which is separated from the sea by a narrow strip of land. The entrance to the castle Remains from the upper Paleolithic era, dating from 20,000 B.C., when Corfu was still united to the mainland region of Epirus, were found on the site of the castle at the rock shelter of Grava Gardikiou, including hunter-gatherer stone tools and animal bones, which have since been removed and are exhibited at the Archaeological Museum of Corfu. The location of Gardiki at the narrow southwest flank of Corfu provided protection to the fields and the southern lowlands of Corfu and in combination with Kassiopi Castle on the northeastern coast of the island and Byzantine Angelokastro protecting the northwestern shore of Corfu, formed a triangular line of defence which protected Corfu during the pre-Venetian era. Architecture The walls of Gardiki Castle form an octagon and the structure features eight strong towers decorated by rows of tiles. There are elements from an ancient structure which have been incorporated into the construction of the castle. The ancient structure was probably a fountain- house. The eight towers are square in shape and the outline of the octagonal structure is almost elliptical. At the top of the southern tower there are traces of a chapel with remnants of religious frescoes of portraits of saints. Although in a state of disrepair, the towers still retain their full height. The castle entrance is preserved but the interior is in a state of ruin. Gardiki Castle is considered one of the most imposing architectural remains in the Ionian Islands, along with Angelokastro, Kassiopi Castle and the two Venetian Fortresses of Corfu City, the Citadel and the New Fort. Historical reference Corfiote noble Andrea Marmora, the earliest historian of Corfu in medieval times, in his 1672 book Della Historia di Corf√π mentions that the despots of Epirus adorned the city of Corfu with \\"most noble buildings\\" and built defences in other places on the island, including the fortresses of Gardiki and Angelokastro amongst other important sites.Andrea Marmora, Della Historia di Corf√π, 1672, Libro 4, p. 210 \\"Adorno egli di nobilissimi edificii la Citt√†; fabbric√≤ in posto, molto atto alla difesa, il castel S.

His father, Fuad Bin Abdurrahman Al-Musawa, was born in Palembang and was a journalist for the Berita Buana newspaper. His mother, Rahmah Binti Hashim Al-Musawa, was also born in Palembang. His father spent ten years in Mecca studying with Alawi Al- Maliki, father of Muhammad Bin Alawi al-Maliki, at the Masjidil Haram. He also received a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism from New York University.\\"The Story of The Late Habib\\". Retrieved: December 21, 2013. Fuad bin Abdurrahman Al-Musawa died in 1996 in Cipanas, Indonesia. Most of Munzir's childhood was spent in Cipanas with his siblings Nabiel, Ramzy, Lulu, and Aliyah. Munzir is considered a sayyid, a descendant of Muhammad in the Ba 'Alawi sada family through his grandson Hussein ibn Ali. Education After high school, Munzir began studying sharia in the ma'had assaqafah of Al-Habib Abdurrahman Assegaf in Bukit Duri, South Jakarta and studied Arabic at LPBA Assalafy. He continued his education in Islamic legal studies at Al Khairat Ma'had in Bekasi, led by Habib Naqib bin Muhammad bin shaykh Abubakar bin Salim. At ma'had Al-Khayrat he became acquainted with Habib Umar bin Hafiz, director and founder of Dar al-Mustafa boarding school in Tarim, Yemen, who visited the school as part of his outreach. In 1994, Munzir received a four-year scholarship to study sharia at the school. He studied fiqh, Qur'anic tafsir, hadith, tawhid, tasawwuf, dawah and other Islamic subjects.

He then began preaching in Jakarta, living in his students' houses. The assembly met on Tuesday night evenings in the homes of his followers, who were primarily older laymen. When the congregation grew too large to meet in private homes, they began meeting in mosques. When one mosque became too small the worshipers moved to a larger one until they established a permanent mosque, Al-Munawwar. Legacy U.S. ambassador to Indonesia Scot Marciel met with Habib Munzir bin Fuad al-Musawa at the cleric‚Äôs residence on January 9, 2013. Munzir founded Majelis Rasulullah, which continues to meet weekly, to teach people that Islam is a religion of peace and love. He said that the organization is for people (especially youth) in crowded cities such as Jakarta who want to find inner peace and turn away from violence, anarchy and drugs. Many of his followers are former drug addicts, alcoholics and criminals who have become devout Muslims because of Munzir. On January 9, 2013, U.S. ambassador to Indonesia Scot Marciel visited Munzir to discuss the importance of religious tolerance, spirituality, mutual understanding and interfaith dialogue in both countries. Family Munzir was married to Khadijah Al-Juneid, with whom he had three children: two sons, Muhammad and Hasan, and a daughter, Fatimah. Wafat Munzir wrote in a blog that Muhammad appeared to him in a dream and told him he would die at age 40.

She served during the Napoleonic Wars and had a relatively uneventful career that ended with her being sold for breaking up in 1815. Career Merope was one of ten Crocus-class brig-sloops designed by the British navy for patrol and protection duties. They carried approximately 86 men, and were rated for fourteen cannons. Meropes keel was laid at Admiralty's Chatham Dockyard in November 1807. She was launched in July 1808 as the third of her class. Commander Michael Dod commissioned her in July 1808. He transferred to , which he commissioned in the Downs anchorage in October. Merope was recommissioned in 1810 under Commander John Houston, for the Leeward Islands station of the British fleet. In 1811 she was under the command of Commander Edward Flin, who sailed her for the Mediterranean on 5 March 1812. =Action at Tarragona= In January 1812 Merope was part of a squadron under Captain Edward Codrington in operating along the north-east coast of Spain in support of Spanish forces during and after the siege of Tarragona (1811). They harassed the French with cannon fire and transported large numbers of reinforcements into the city by sea. Codrington left Merope and at Villa Nueva to assist General Joaqu√≠n Ib√°√±ez Cuevas, Baron d'Eroles, who planned to march on Tarragona. Around 20 January during a battle for Villa Suca, French dragoons captured Flin, Commander James Pringle of Sparrowhawk, and Lieutenant Cattle of Blake while they were on the beach near Salon. The British officers escaped during the d'Eroles assault on Tarragona. Blake came into Villa Nueva on 25 June and joined Merope in firing on French troops on the road to the west. The British vessels succeeded in disabling three wagons, forcing the French to abandon them. On 29 January Codrington sent , Merope, and to Matar√≥ to assist the defenders there against a French force marching from Barcelona. The next day the three vessels observed a French force advancing on Matar√≥ and fired on it near San Juan de Vilasar. The British were not able to prevent the French from entering Matar√≥ and partially occupied it. The French withdrew at daybreak on the following morning, escaping through some vineyards that were out of range of the British vessels and made their way to Arens de Mar (Arenys de Mar). =Action off the Peninsula= In July 1812 Commander John Charles Gawen Roberts recommissioned Merope for patrolling the Spanish coast. Merope left Portsmouth on 23 July. She then served on Spain's east coast under the orders of Rear-admiral Hallowell supporting the army in Catalonia. On 13 October 1812 she captured the San Antonio. Merope was one of seven British warships present at the Spanish capture of Tarragona on 19 August 1813. Lieutenant William Benjamin Suckling, who received his promotion to Commander on 1 July 1814, recommissioned Merope for the Mediterranean. She sailed to North America in 1815. On her return, in July the Admiralty placed her in ordinary. Fate The Navy offered Merope for sale at Portsmouth on 23 March. She sold on 23 November for ¬£930 for breaking up.

In ca. 675 he was taken prisoner by the Byzantine Empire due to his hostile intentions towards Thessalonica, and transported to Constantinople. Perbundos managed to escape, but was recaptured and executed, whereupon the Slavic tribes of Macedonia rose up and laid siege to Thessalonica.  Life  Perbundos is attested only in the Miracles of Saint Demetrius, a 7th-century collection of homilies in praise of Saint Demetrius, the patron saint of Thessalonica, which provides much unique historical information about the collapse of Byzantine imperial authority and the Slavic settlement in the Balkans. In the second book of the Miracles, Perbundos is called the \\"king of the Rhynchinoi\\" (), an apparently relatively powerful Slavic tribe living near Thessalonica. According to the Miracles, in ca. 675/6 he came to the attention of the Byzantine archon of Thessalonica as being hostile and planning an attack on the city. When informed, Emperor Constantine IV ordered his arrest, and during a visit to the city, Perbundos was seized, put in irons and sent to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The Rhynchinoi, along with the other Slavic tribes living in the Strymon valley (Strymonitai), sent envoys to the emperor seeking his release, and Constantine promised to let him go once the war with the Arabs was over. In the meantime, however, Perbundos found an ally in the person of an imperial translator, who urged him to escape. By passing himself off as a Byzantine (he spoke fluent Greek and was dressed in the Byzantine manner) Perbundos simply walked out of the city through the Blachernae Gate, and found refuge on the translator's estate near Bizye. Enraged, the Emperor launched a manhunt for the escaped prisoner, and notified Thessalonica that the city might soon be attacked. The search ended after forty days, when the translator's wife was discovered as she was bringing food to Perbundos' hideout. The translator and his family were executed, while Perbundos was interrogated. After trying once more to escape again, and as his intention of raising all the Slavic tribes in revolt against the empire became evident, he too was executed. On the news of Perbundos' execution, the Rhynchinoi, the Strymonitai and the Sagoudatai made common cause, rose up and laid siege to Thessalonica for two years.

It is the seventh volume of Roberts's SPQR series, featuring Senator Decius Metellus. Plot summary 55 BC: Senator Decius Metellus the Younger is happy for once: he is in Rome, having been granted leave from Julius Caesar's campaign in Gaul to return home and campaign for aedile, which he is confident of winning because of his family's influence, and he is newly married to Caesar's niece, Julia the Younger. The topic of discussion that year is Crassus's planned war with Parthia, which will commence as soon as Crassus steps down as Consul and departs Rome to take up his governorship of Syria. Crassus's planned war is equally unpopular with the populares and the Senate, but there is little anyone can do to prevent it, since Crassus is wealthy enough to raise and equip his own Legions. While canvassing for votes in the Forum, Decius is unnerved by a visit from his mortal enemy, Clodius. Since Crassus, Pompey and Caesar reached an agreement at Luca the previous year, all three are working together to advance Crassus's ambitions, so Clodius (Caesar's man) tells Decius that Crassus will finance his term of office as aedile - which Decius already knows will be ruinously expensive - if he will help convince his family to drop their opposition to the Parthian war. Later, the offer is repeated, by Crassus himself, while Decius and Julia are attending a formal dinner at Milo's house. As tempted as he is, Decius refuses, and is unsettled when Crassus appears personally insulted. The next day, Decius is approached by Gaius Ateius Capito, the tribune of the plebs most vehemently opposed to the war, who heard of Decius' refusals to Crassus and hails him as an ally. Decius cautiously says that, although he and his family oppose the war, he does not see what can be done, legally, to prevent Crassus leaving for Syria. Capito winks and says he is planning to appeal to \\"divine\\" forces. On the day of Crassus' departure, Capito appears atop the city gates, dressed in a bizarre robe and enacting a ritual to place a curse on Crassus and all his followers, then disappears. This act of sacrilege terrifies the populace, since it is an offense to the gods and will bring misfortune to the whole city. The Chief Vestal orders Crassus to depart Rome immediately, then declares a state of emergency, while Pompey convenes a meeting of the Senate. The first, necessary expurgation is a lustrum performed by the junior members of the Senate, including Decius: carrying three sacrificial animals on a litter around the perimeter of the whole city (i.e., carrying over a thousand pounds weight over sixteen consecutive hours). Decius is one of the twenty Senators who completes the task, and stumbles home in exhaustion. The next day, Decius is handed a commission by a secret committee of the Vestals and the state pontifices: during his ritual, while speaking in a number of obscure languages, Ateius Capito spoke the Secret Name of Rome, a magic talisman supposedly known to only a handful of the priesthood's inner circle. Decius is to find out how Ateius learned the name. Decius starts by consulting the fortune tellers and priests of foreign cults most prominent among his aristocratic wife's friends (these are regularly expelled from the city, but a few always bribe the aediles into letting them stay). One he consults, a Greek scholar named Ariston, admits that he schooled Ateius Capito in ancient religious practices and certain magic rituals, but denies giving him any dangerous knowledge. Matters are complicated when Ateius Capito is found murdered, mauled almost beyond recognition. Though Capito was reviled by the city for performing the curse, a tribune of the plebs is supposed to be sacrosanct from violence, and the populace is outraged almost to the point of rioting. Pompey hands Decius a second commission, to locate Capito's murderer - or, at least, a convenient scapegoat to pacify the mob. Decius tracks Capito's movements a short distance beyond the city gate, then loses the trail. While investigating his past career, Decius is struck by the fact that, while in office, Capito devoted himself wholeheartedly to opposing Crassus' war with Parthia, to the exclusion of all other business. Julia points out that a tribunate is meant to be the start of a political career, yet Capito committed professional suicide by performing the curse, which means (assuming he wasn't insane) he must have had some alternate plan for the rest of his life. The mob is further outraged when news arrives from Egypt that King Ptolemy Auletes has put his daughter, Berenice, to death, for rebelling against his rule, along with several thousand of her followers, including several prominent Alexandrian citizens with friends and connections in Rome. Pompey warns Decius that he has maybe one day left before the mob explodes in a riot. When he consults with his physician friend, Asklepeiodes, who examined Capito's body, Decius is surprised to hear him remark that Capito must have been a child when he was first enrolled in the equestrian order. Decius asks him to explain, and Asklepeiodes says that the body he examined was not so badly mauled that he couldn't estimate his age - he was no older than his early twenties. Decius realizes that Capito faked his death, and is hiding in Rome somewhere. After a second, more careful review of Capito's records, Decius solves the case, and a short time later, he, Milo, and Pompey storm into the Egyptian embassy, to confront the ambassador, Lisas. Ateius Capito met King Ptolemy while serving on the staff of Aemilius Scaurus, and offered to become Ptolemy's agent in Roman politics. The one thing Ptolemy wanted more than anything else was to prevent Crassus from acquiring his command in Syria; earlier that year, when Ptolemy petitioned the Senate for a military expedition to put him back on the Egyptian throne, Crassus vetoed the idea, going so far as to produce a fraudulent interpretation of the Sibylline Books, arguing that the gods would be angered at such an undertaking. Ptolemy eventually regained his throne by bribing Aulus Gabinius to mount an expedition, but never forgave Crassus. Thanks to Crassus' money, Capito could not legally prevent him from getting the Syrian command, so he decided to use the curse, which he purchased from Ariston (a corrupt man who also sold Crassus his fake Sibylline prophecy). After performing the curse, Capito faked his death by having a young slave dressed in his clothes and mauled by the Nile crocodiles kept as pets inside the Embassy, where he has been hiding out ever since, waiting to make a dash to his new retirement villa in Egypt. Pompey threatens to make war on all of Egypt, and Lisas reluctantly tells him where Capito is hiding. With dramatic flair, Pompey produces Capito at Capito's own state-sponsored funeral and then tries him in front of the people, allowing them to see how they have been duped. Capito is convicted of sacrilege and treason, and hurled from the Tarpeian Rock. Decius remarks to Lisas that, although Capito is a fraud and a traitor, his curse may turn out to be perfectly effective. Decius is right: eighteen months after leaving Rome, Crassus is killed, along with most of his army, in the disastrous Battle of Carrhae.

The journal is published by Bioscientifica on behalf of the Society for Endocrinology. It is also an official journal of the European Society of Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society of Australia. The co-editors-in-chief are Dr Sofianos Andrikopoulos (University of Melbourne) and Dr Colin Farquharson (University of Edinburgh). According to the ISI Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2017 impact factor of 3.297.  History  The Journal of Molecular Endocrinology was founded in 1988 in response to the rapid increase in research output in the areas of molecular and genetic endocrinology that had occurred as a result of technological advancements of the 1970s and 1980s, such as the development of recombinant DNA techniques, DNA sequencing and the invention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The founding editor-in-chief was Barry L Brown. The journal was conceived by members of the Society for Endocrinology and the editorial board of Journal of Endocrinology, as the existing publication‚Äôs sister journal. The Journal of Molecular Endocrinology was initially offered free of charge to all its subscribers. In its first year there were three issues of the journal published. This increased to six issues each year from 1989 to 2015 and, as of 2017, there are eight annual issues. In 2006, the Journal of Molecular Endocrinology was adopted as an official journal of the European Society of Endocrinology and in 2014 of the Endocrine Society of Australia.https://www.endocrinesociety.org.au/downloads/esa_news_april2014v5Final.pdf The increasingly regular use of molecular biology methods in work published in Journal of Endocrinology often resulted in a blurred line between the subject areas covered by the journals. Consequently, in 2011 it was decided by the Publications Committee of the Society for Endocrinology that the two publications would have a single joint editorial board. This came into being in 2012. While papers would still be submitted to one or other of the journals, the senior editors would have the opportunity to suggest that manuscripts be transferred between them where appropriate.  Online access  The Journal of Molecular Endocrinology was first published online in October 1997 in PDF format. From October 2004, the online offering was extended to include the HTML full text version of articles and separate figures. All peer- reviewed editorial and review content is free to access from publication. Research articles are under access control for the first 12 months before being made available to the public. During the first 12 months the content is accessible for those at subscribing institutions and members of the Society for Endocrinology and the European Society of Endocrinology. The journal automatically deposits articles to PubMed Central on behalf of authors who are funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for release 12 months from publication, enabling authors to comply with the NIH Public Access Policy. Journal of Molecular Endocrinology is a hybrid open access journal, offering a ‚Äògold‚Äô open access option whereby authors can pay an article publishing charge upon acceptance to have their article made freely available online immediately upon publication. These articles are automatically deposited into PubMed Central. All journal content is included in the World Health Organization‚Äôs HINARI scheme, which offers free or reduced-price access for institutions in certain developing countries to health-related research.

It is located in the village of Haukedalen. It one of the two churches for the Holsen og Haukedalen parish which is part of the Sunnfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1885 using designs by the architect Hartvig Sverdrup Eckhoff. The church seats about 120 people. Haukedalen Church is located at an elevation of above sea level, and within Sogn og Fjordane county, only Borgund Stave Church and Borgund Church in the municipality of L√¶rdal are higher in elevation. Haukedalen is also the church located farthest from the sea in all of Sogn og Fjordane county, from the head of the F√∏rdefjorden. The community of Haukedalen is on the high ground of the Gaula river watershed, and it is geographically more closely connected to the municipality of Gaular. The Haukedalen people have always belonged to the parish of F√∏rde, even though they had to cross the high R√∏rvikfjellet pass in the Gaularfjellet mountains to reach the Holsen Church (until Haukedalen received its own church). Haukedalen is in the geographical centre of the county of Sogn og Fjordane and is thus both distant and central in location. History View of the front exterior View of the side exterior The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1699. At that time, it was called a \\"chapel\\" and it fell under the control of Holsen Church, about to the west in the next valley. The residents of Haukedalen had been asking for their own church for a long time. It is possible that there was a medieval church located here that at some point was torn down, but there are no surviving records to support that. Historically, the residents of the Haukedalen valley were part of the parish of Holsen Church in the next valley over. However, large quantities of snow have stopped a good many church travelers across the mountain pass between Holsen and Haukedalen. There is a place called Likhillaren where people used to leave coffins if darkness or bad weather set in while they were on their way to Holsen Church. Towards the end of the 17th century (likely in 1673), the residents of Haukedalen at long last got their own church. It was built close to the lake Haukedalsvatnet. The church was about long and rectangular in shape. Prior to 1859, the vicar for the F√∏rde parish came to Haukedalen only twice a year, around midsummer and on Michaelmas (29 September). Funerals were taken care of by the people in the village. It was practice to \\"sing out\\" the dead body at the home, then the coffin was buried at the churchyard. The church rituals had to wait until the next church service. The midsummer mass tradition is special, and it is something Haukedalen shares with other hill valleys, such as at Guddal. The midsummer mass is even today a day of celebration for people in the community. In 1885, the old chapel was torn down and replaced on the same site with a new building. The new church was consecrated on 8 July 1885 and this time it held the status of a church (rather than a chapel). Since that time, Haukedalen has had a worship service about once a month. Building The Haukedalen church of today was built in 1884 and consecrated the year after, the same year in which the F√∏rde Church was finished. As was the case with the old church, the people in the valley covered all the expenses, which amounted to . It is a basilica church in timber framework, painted white, with the steeple above the porch to the west. The nave is , the chancel is . A vestry was built to the east in the 1950s. Also at that time, the church was also insulated, electric lighting and heating were installed, and the interior was renovated with new paneling and new seats. Historically, people sat in the church according to their rank, with the people from the largest farms on the front benches and the smaller farms in the back, but this was changed for the 75-year anniversary in 1960.

History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1327, but the church was not new at that time. That church was likely a stave church and it stood until around 1620-1625 when a new church was built adjacent to it. When the new timber-framed church was completed, the old church was torn down. In 1838, the church was once again torn down and replaced by a small timber-framed long church. This church, however, was not long lasting. It too was torn down in 1885 when the present church was built on the same site. The new church was consecrated on 1 October 1885 by the Bishop Fredrik Waldemar Hvoslef.

The nearly 500-year-old church was one of the last stave churches that was still standing in the Sunnfjord district when it was torn down around 1722. A new timber-framed church was built about to the northwest where the new church would be safer from flooding. The new church sits near the mouth of the river Nordd√∏la and the lake Holsavatnet. In 1861, the small timber-framed church was torn down and a new church was built on the same site. The new church was consecrated on 11 December 1861 by the local Dean Johan Christie. From the 13th century until the 17th century, the people of the nearby Haukedalen valley also belonged to the Holsen Church parish, before they had their own church: Haukedalen Church. Building The church has a symmetrical appearance, with a steeple in the middle. The porch to the west and the vestry to the east are equal in size. The interior walls are not painted, there is no gallery, and the ceiling is flat and painted blue. On each long side there are three large windows. The church remained unchanged until 1936, when the ceiling, mouldings, altar rail, and pulpit were given new colours. Angular braces, which supported the ceiling and the walls, were removed, and the church interior became more open. Behind the simple wooden cross on the altar a canopy with stars against a blue background was installed.

Thomas Almond Ayres (1816-1858) was a California gold rush-era artist, most famous for drawing the first rendering of Yosemite Valley to be published and popularized. Ayres was born in Woodbridge, New Jersey in 1816. As a young adult, he moved to Wisconsin Territory and worked as a draftsman in what was to become St. Paul, Minnesota (then still part of Wisconsin Territory). In 1849, he went to California, embarking from New York on the steamship Panama on February 4. As the announcement of gold was only made by President Polk the previous December, this made Ayres among the first to head to the gold fields. He arrived in August, and immediately set out to the diggings. Like many fortune seekers, he was unlucky; however, he spent his time constructively, sketching many gold rush and other California scenes, eventually earning a reputation as a landscape artist. In 1855, the publisher and promoter James Hutchings conceived the idea of publishing a magazine to popularize California, which he was to call Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine. Hutchings' motivations were to attract immigrants, as well as to make money on his publications. He invited Ayres to accompany him into the Yosemite, and in June 1855 as the party followed the traditional Indian trail into the valley they stopped at what became known as Inspiration Point so that Ayres could sketch the view, the first such drawing of the valley to be published. For the next five days, Ayres sketched many of the now famous and iconic views of the valley, one per day. Hutchings report of the trip was published in Volume 1 Number 1, and Ayres himself wrote a separate account in the Daily Alta California. In addition to publishing in the magazine, Ayres converted his sketches into a popular panorama displayed at McNulty's Hall in Sacramento. In 1856, Ayres returned to Yosemite Valley and recorded several more sketches. These he took back east himself and exhibited them at the American Art Union in New York. As a result, Harper & Brothers commissioned him to return to California to gather images for them to publish. In the winter of 1857-1858, after stopping over in San Francisco, Ayres traveled around southern California gathering material. On April 26, 1858, as he was headed back to San Francisco, the passenger ship he was in sunk in a storm off Point Dume. Everyone on the ship perished, and all of the sketches Ayres had brought with him were lost. The quality of his work as art is not generally considered high, but since his work is historically important and the originals are rare, these works are considered to be very significant.

He discovered place cells in the hippocampus, and that they show a specific kind of temporal coding in the form of theta phase precession. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2014, together with May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser; he has received several other awards. He has worked at the University College London for his entire career, but also held a part-time chair at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology at the behest of his Norwegian collaborators, the Mosers. Education and early life Born in New York City to Irish immigrant parents, O'Keefe attended Regis High School (Manhattan) and received a BA degree from the City College of New York. He went on to study at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he obtained an MA degree in 1964, and a PhD degree in Psychology in 1967, supervised by Ronald Melzack. Career and research O'Keefe went to University College London in 1967 as a US NIMH postdoctoral research fellow working with the late Patrick Wall. He has been there ever since and was promoted to Professor in 1987. At the behest of his collaborators Edvard Moser and May-Britt Moser he was appointed to a part-time professorial chair at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 2014. =Discovery of place cells= O‚ÄôKeefe and his student Jonathan Dostrovsky discovered place cells by systematically analyzing the environmental factors influencing the firing properties of individual hippocampal neurons. His many publications on place cells have been highly cited. In addition, he published an influential book with Lynn Nadel, proposing the functional role of the hippocampus as a cognitive map for spatial memory function. In extensions of his work, place cells have been analyzed experimentally or simulated in models in hundreds of papers. =Discovery of theta phase precession= In further research on place cells, O‚ÄôKeefe found evidence for a distinctive variation of temporal coding of information by the timing of action potentials in place cells, relative to an oscillatory EEG cycle known as the theta rhythm, as opposed to spike timing within a single cell. In a 1993 paper, he and Michael Recce demonstrated that place cells spike at different phases relative to theta rhythm oscillations in the local field potential of the hippocampus. As a rat enters the firing field of a place cell, the spiking starts at late phases of theta rhythm, and as the rat moves through the firing field, the spikes shift to earlier phases of the theta cycle. This effect has been replicated in numerous subsequent papers, providing evidence for the coding of sensory input by the timing of spikes. Numerous models have addressed the potential physiological mechanisms of theta phase precession. =Prediction and discovery of boundary vector cells= In a paper in 1996, O'Keefe and Neil Burgess presented data showing shifts in the position and size of place cell firing fields when the barriers defining the environment were shifted. In this and subsequent papers, they presented a model of this phenomenon predicting the existence of boundary vector cells that would respond at a specific distance from barriers in the environment. Several years later, this explicit theoretical prediction was supported by extensive experimental data demonstrating boundary cells with the predicted properties in the subiculum and the medial entorhinal cortex (where they are sometimes referred to as border cells). =Awards and honours= O'Keefe giving Nobel lecture in Oslo, December 2014 O'Keefe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1992 and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 1998. In addition, he received the Feldberg Foundation Prize in 2001 and the Grawemeyer Award in psychology in 2006 (with Lynn Nadel). In 2007, he received the British Neuroscience Association Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Neuroscience and in 2008 he received the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies European Journal of Neuroscience Award. Later in 2008, O'Keefe was awarded the Gruber Prize in Neuroscience. He was appointed as the inaugural director of the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour.

The series follows the daily life of Haruto Kirishima as he becomes enamored with Yuzuki Eba. A story arc from A Town Where You Live was adapted into an original video animation series called A Town Where You Live: Twilight Intersection by Tatsunoko Production in 2012. An anime television series adaptation animated by Gonzo aired from July to September 2013, later spawning a radio program, drama CD, and an image song. Reception towards the manga was mixed with reviewers praising the plot for its realism or panning it as predictable and clich√©. Plot Years prior, Haruto Kirishima befriends Yuzuki Eba and asks her to return to his hometown, Sh≈çbara, Hiroshima, if she is ever troubled. In the present, Yuzuki transfers to Sh≈çbara due to her estrangement with her step- family. She helps Haruto develop a friendship with his current crush, Nanami Kanzaki, but Haruto ultimately falls in love with Yuzuki. He helps Yuzuki reconcile with her family which encourages her to return to Tokyo. The two begin a long-distance relationship until Yuzuki suddenly cuts all ties with him. Haruto transfers to Tokyo and learns Yuzuki has begun dating Kyousuke Kazama out of sympathy for his terminal illness. In response, Haruto declares he will take Yuzuki back prompting Kyousuke to take a risky surgery in order to compete for Yuzuki's love fairly. Following Kyousuke's death, Haruto and Yuzuki stop seeing each other out of guilt. Two years later, Haruto has been dating Asuka Mishima. When he reunites with Yuzuki, the two realize they still love each other. Haruto ends his relationship with Asuka in order to be with Yuzuki which causes their friends to ostracize them. When Yuzuki's father objects to their relationship and attempts to relocate her, she runs away from home to live with Haruto; the two eventually earn her father's approval. After reconciling with their friends and graduating from university, Haruto takes a job that relocates him to K≈çchi. Unable to sustain their relationship, the two break up; two years later, Haruto is transferred back to Tokyo and reunites with Yuzuki, who had been waiting for his return. The two are married shortly after. =Characters= ; Haruto is a high school student in Sh≈çbara, Hiroshima. He has an earnest personality and chastises others when they are in the wrong.

Episode list Reception In Japan, A Town Where You Live manga volumes frequently appeared on weekly sales charts during their week of release. Jason Thompson praised A Town Where You Lives serious, mature tone and wrote that the audiences will either like the series for its realism or criticize it as slow and mundane. Manga-News praised the series' introduction for being more realistic than the author's previous work, Suzuka, and the plot which was described as eventful. In later volumes, Manga-News criticized the plot for being predictable, encompassing clich√© aspects of the genre, and for dragging its story. They also panned the characters' behavior, calling it implausible and inconsistent. Manga-News returned to positive reviews during the volumes involving Kyousuke Kazama; they praised the story arc for introducing a new setting, for breaking away from the usual classicism, and for surprising the readers for the first time in the series. Following this, Manga-News returned to negative reviews, echoing their previous points. AnimeLand had similar reactions. Initially, they were positive, praising the realistic protagonist, but further reviews repeated Manga-News' criticisms.

The pass of Velestino controlled the road and railway lines linking the port city of Volos with the interior of the Thessalian plain. As the Greek army withdrew from Larissa to Farsala, a reinforced brigade under Colonel Konstantinos Smolenskis was sent to occupy the pass and cover Volos and the right of the new Greek position. At the same time, the Ottoman high command dispatched a mixed force of cavalry and infantry in the same direction to capture Volos. The first Greek detachments arrived in the area in the morning of 27 April, some hours ahead of the Ottomans, and occupied the heights around Velestino. As a result, a first clash developed in the same evening as the first Ottoman forces arrived in the area. The Ottomans were repelled and retreated to Kileler, while the bulk of Smolenskis' command arrived during the night and took up defensive positions on the next day, while the Ottomans remained inactive. The Ottoman forces resumed their attack on 29 April, chiefly through the arrival of Colonel Mahmud Muhtar as the representative of the Ottoman commander-in-chief Edhem Pasha. The Ottoman forces advanced up to the Greek positions planning to concentrate their attack on the Greek right, but in the event the advance of the Ottoman left under Naim Pasha was delayed, while on the Ottoman right, Mahmud Muhtar launched attacks on the Greek left. As a result, the Ottoman commanders altered their plans to focus on the Greek left, planning to outflank the Greek positions on the next day. However, both the outflanking manoeuvre as well as frontal infantry attacks and an attempt to penetrate the Greek lines with a massed cavalry charge failed on 30 April, both due to Greek resistance and poor coordination among the Ottoman units. As a result, the Ottomans broke off their attack and withdrew. Edhem Pasha retired the cavalry from the battle to recuperate, and replaced it with the 5th Infantry Division. The First Battle of Velestino was thus a Greek victory; the only major battlefield success for the Greek army during the war, which propelled Smolenskis to the status of a national hero. The Second Battle of Velestino began on 5 May, to coincide with the Battle of Farsala between the main body of the Ottoman army and the bulk of the Greek forces. Once again the Ottomans attempted to turn the Greek left flank, but the active Greek resistance thwarted them. On the next day, however, the Ottoman attack in the same area was more successful, as this time the Greeks were unable to bring in sufficient reinforcements to counter the outflanking manoeuvre. The Ottoman success forced the Greek left back, obliging Colonel Smolenskis to order a retreat. As the Ottomans did not exploit their success, the Greek forces were able to withdraw unmolested to Almyros, where they remained until the main Greek army was defeated at the Battle of Domokos. Background Following the Greek defeats in the battles of the frontier, the Greek forces of the Army of Thessaly were forced to withdraw to Larissa, but a panic broke out and the withdrawal degenerated into chaos during the night of 11/12 April. This forced the Greek commander-in-chief, Crown Prince Constantine, to abandon any idea of defending the line of the Pineios River, and withdraw further to Farsala. The Greek withdrawal was disorderly, leaving behind large quantities of material. Ottomans followed hesitantly, losing the chance to destroy the Greek army or capture the port city of Volos. This gave the Greeks time to regroup and organize a defensive position at Farsala, and also send forces from there to cover the approaches to Volos at Velestino. Velestino is a small town located in southwestern Thessaly. Its strategic significance lies in its geographic position in a pass between the Chalkodonion‚ÄìKaradagh Mountains (the ancient Cynoscephalae Hills) to the west and a western spur of Mount Pelion on the east, through which the road and railway line linking the Pagasetic Gulf and the port of Volos to the inland Thessalian plain and Larissa. The railway line from Volos also branched off to Farsala, and was thus vital for the supply of the Greek army at Farsala by sea, since the overland route via Lamia was difficult due to the lack of transport means. First Battle of Velestino, 27‚Äì30 April Dispositions of the Greek and Ottoman armies on 25 April 1897 =27 April= On 26 April, a \\"Mixed Brigade\\" was established to occupy the Velestino position. It was formed around the 3rd Brigade (7th and 8th Infantry Regiments) commanded by Colonel Konstantinos Smolenskis, with the addition of the 6th Evzone Battalion, a mountain artillery battalion, an engineer company from the 2nd Engineer Battalion, and a cavalry company. Two days later, a field artillery battery from the 2nd Artillery Regiment was added to it. Due to shortage of rail carriages, most of this force moved from Farsala to Velestino on foot. Only the Evzone Battalion, an engineer company, and an infantry company of the 7th Regiment's III Battalion (III/7) were sent by rail, arriving at Velestino at 11:00 on 27 April. There they established a defensive position around the Velestino railway station, and deployed a company to cover the eaves of the forest to the east, near the fork of railway line from Larissa to Volos and Farsala. The artillery and cavalry arrived next, around 15:00, with the rest of the troops following behind on foot. Only towards the end of the day were trains found to carry the 8th Regiment's III Battalion (III/8), an infantry company, and Colonel Smolenskis himself to the area. On the Ottoman side, the commander-in-chief, Edhem Pasha, dispatched a mixed force to capture Volos, as the Ottomans had received information that the latter city was held by only 200 men. The force, under Suleiman Pasha, was composed of the 13th and 14th Cavalry Regiments plus three companies of the 6th Imperial Horse Guards Regiment (12 companies in total), a horse artillery battery, and the 3rd Bursa Regiment of the 5th Infantry Division. Setting out from Larissa at 10:00 on 27 April, they moved via Gherli (modern Armenio) and its cavalry vanguard reached the area of Velestino at 17:30 on 27 April, when they crossed the bridge of Rizomylos. The Greek forces at Velestino, themselves having arrived hours before, only became aware of the Ottoman approach at 17:00. Immediately the 6th Evzone Battalion, along with the other units on site, deployed its forces: two companies moved to the direction of the Ottoman advance, two others moved to occupy the height of Velestino and Ovrias Gala, and another company covered the artillery, which took position around the railway station. The two cavalry squadrons were ordered to launch a spoiling attack against the Ottoman advance. At 17:30, as the Ottomans were crossing the Rizomylos bridge and their leading cavalry company was approaching Velestino, the Evzones opened fire. Unaware of the size of the opposing forces, Suleiman Pasha decided to break through in force, and sent three cavalry companies to capture the railway station. Faced with stiff resistance, Suleiman Pasha now employed his own artillery about one kilometre north of the Rizomylos bridge, and deployed his entire division: three companies were to continue the attack on the railway station, while the other seven were to advance towards Volos. Each of the two groups was divided into three echelons, the first in open order and the second and third in close- order formation. The firefight continued until 18:30, when the Greek forces launched a counterattack in the direction of the Rizomylos bridge. With their backs to the Rizomylos stream, Suleiman Pasha's forces were in danger of being cut off if the bridge were captured. Mistakenly estimating the Greek forces at much larger than they actually were, the Ottoman commander ordered a retreat, first to Gherli and then, along with the Bursa Regiment, to Kileler. Despite the Ottoman withdrawal, rumours spread in the Greek rear that the heights around Velestino had been captured, and that the Greek forces were about to be encircled. This led to cases of panic, sporadic wild shots and desertions. The entire artillery battalion withdrew to Volos, followed by two cavalry platoons, and a few Evzones and infantrymen. The 2nd Company of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment took flight towards Almyros, spreading panic; the field hospitals also fled to Volos, while the peasant carters hired to carry supplies for the troops simply abandoned their carts and fled. When Smolenskis arrived at the nearby village of Aerino after nightfall, the local railway station staff informed him of the rumours that Velestino had been captured by the Ottomans. He nevertheless pushed on foot towards Velestino with the bulk of his brigade, which had begun arriving; but being unaware of the terrain, and due to the late hour, after making contact with the units of the 8th Regiment, both he and his men spent the night on the heights to the southwest of Velestino. On the next morning, Smolenskis busied himself with deploying his troops in a defensive position, and trying to restore discipline and morale. His requests to the Greek headquarters to be allowed to shoot deserters on the spot were denied, but his arrival did calm nerves and restore order in the Greek units. =28 April= The Ottoman commander-in-chief Edhem Pasha dispatched one of the 5th Division's brigade commanders, Naim Pasha, to take over command of the operation, and sent another infantry regiment and a mountain artillery battery as well. Arriving at Kileler around noon on the 28th, Naim Pasha sent two cavalry companies towards Velestino on reconnaissance at 13:30, while half an hour later his main force, comprising his entire infantry brigade and Suleiman Pasha's cavalry division, followed suit, encamping at Gherli. Apart from reconnaissance activity and torching the village of Rizomylos, the Ottoman forces remained quiet that day. The cavalry detachments returned in the evening, reporting that the pass was held by a few Greek battalions and artillery. In the meantime, however, Edhem Pasha had become worried at the inactivity of Naim Pasha, and in the early hours of the 29th sent one of his staff officers, Cavalry Colonel Mahmud Muhtar, to examine the situation on the ground and take any necessary measures. =29 April= After his arrival at Gherli around noon on 29 April, Mahmud Muhtar urged Naim Pasha and Suleiman Pasha to attack before the Greeks had had enough time to establish strong fortifications; he also pointed out that the rest of the Ottoman army was at the very same time preparing to advance on Farsala, and that the Greek forces opposing them were not as strong as they thought.The energetic Mahmud Muhtar would prove to be the driving force of the Ottoman efforts to break through the Velestino position, but the Ottomans remained hampered by the lack of unified command: Naim Pasha, who outranked Mahmud Muhtar, disregarded his advice and proved himself a dilatory and hesitant commander. Sketch of the Ottoman and Greek positions prior to the Ottoman attack on 30 April The Ottoman commanders worked out a plan of attack in two columns. Suleiman Pasha was put in charge of the right (western) column, although Colonel Mahmud Muhtar, who joined the column ostensibly as the commander-in-chief's liaison, was its de facto commander. It comprised the Bursa, Orhaneli, and Bilecik infantry battalions, a horse artillery battery, and 7 cavalry companies (three from the 6th Guards Regiment and the 13th Cavalry Regiment), and was intended to operate as a diversion, while the main attack would be led by Naim Pasha on the left (eastern) flank along the road to Volos, against the Greek centre and right. Naim Pasha's column comprised the Adapazarƒ±, Elmalƒ±, √áakƒ±rca, and Tuzca battalions and two companies from the Mihali√ß battalion, the 14th Cavalry Regiment, and a field artillery battery. On the Greek side, the forces under Smolenskis' command on 29 April numbered 6 infantry companies on the feet of Malouka Hill, to the west of Velestino, with an artillery battery on the Panagia height. A battalion occupied the low ground before the pass itself, between the Velestino railway station and the height of Ovrias Gala to the northeast, near Rizomylos. The 6th Evzone Battalion held the Ovrias Gala height itself. Another infantry battalion, with an artillery battery, was placed at the Pilaf Tepe height. Two battalions (minus a company sent to Volos) remained at Velestino as a reserve. The Greek troops had dug trenches and field works before their positions. The Ottomans began their march at 14:00, and were detected by the Greek scouts an hour later, as the Ottoman vanguard detachments approached the village of Koniari (modern Chloi) in front of the Greek left. At around 16:00, Suleiman Pasha's troops occupied the heights around Koniari, and started firing on the Greek positions. After about half an hour, Mahmud Muhtar had gauged the Greek strength, which he estimated at 3‚Äì4 battalions with a few mountain artillery pieces, and, given the numerical superiority of the Ottoman forces, decided to launch an all-out attack. However, before giving this order, he had to coordinate with Naim Pasha's column, and set out to meet with him at Rizomylos, only to find that the latter's column had moved slowly and not yet reached its planned positions. Only at around 17:00 did the leading elements of Naim Pasha's column arrive at Rizomylos, with the main body following half an hour behind. Naim Pasha launched an attack against the Greek positions at Ovrias Gala at 18:00, but was repulsed, and nightfall halted any further operations. According to Colmar von der Goltz, Mahmud Muhtar suggested a night attack against the Greek left at 03:00, but again this did not take place because the additional battalion promised by Naim Pasha for this operation failed to arrive on time. With the shift of troops and focus to their right, the Ottomans effectively reversed their original plan and made their main effort against the Greek left. View of the battle from the Greek command post on the hills south of Velestino On the Greek side, Colonel Smolenskis asked Crown Prince Constantine for urgent reinforcements, and in the same night received by rail the 4/2 field artillery battery, which took up position near the railway station, and the 4th Evzone Battalion, which took up positions at Ayvali (modern Rigaion) to cover Smolenskis' left flank. As a result, by the next morning, the heights of Malouka Hill on the Greek left were defended by the equivalent of two full battalions (III/7 Battalion minus two companies, IV/8 Battalion, two companies of 8th Regiment) and two mountain batteries (12 guns), while the positions on the low ground between the railway station and the Ovrias Gala height also strengthened to six companies (II/7 Battalion and two companies from 8th Regiment), leaving 7 companies of 8th Regiment as a reserve. On the right, Ovrias Gala was held by six companies: the 6th Evzone Battalion, minus a company detached to cover the village of Kapourna (modern Glafyra), along with a company from III/7 Battalion. The engineer company was placed on the Latomi heights east of the Velestino railway station, while the last company of III/7 Battalion had been detached to maintain order in Volos. =30 April= Sketch of the firefight between the Ottoman and Greek infantry at Rizomylos The Ottoman attack began at dawn (5:00) on the 30th, with Naim Pasha's column attacking the Ovrias Gala and Pilaf Tepe heights, with support from a battery at Rizomylos. The attacking Ottoman forces, however, were repulsed both at Ovrias Gala and in front of Velestino. The Greeks were aided by the recently arrived field battery, which took position near the railway station at 9:00. At Ovrias Gala, the commander of the Greek II/7 Battalion, Major Kopsidas, launched a counterattack with two companies against the Ottoman reserves, throwing them into panic and dispersing them, until an Ottoman battalion and cavalry company came to their rescue, and attacked the Greeks' left. Eventually, the Greek column withdrew back to its trenches before the railway station around noon. The Ottomans then launched an attack on the Megavouni height with a battalion, but the attack was repulsed by 17:00. Likewise, in the centre, the repeated attempts of the Adapazarƒ± battalion and the two companies from the Mihali√ß battalion to evict the Greek defenders from the forest north of Velestino, failed. At 11:30 a Greek company attempted to launch a counterattack but was likewise repulsed. On the Ottoman right, Mahmud Muhtar left the Bursa battalion with the horse artillery battery to pin down the Greek left, while personally leading six infantry companies from the Orhaneli and Bilecik battalions on a wide outflanking manoeuvre around Mount Karadagh to the rear of the Greek left's positions. Two infantry companies of the Bilecik battalion and seven cavalry companies were kept as a reserve to exploit any success. By noon, Mahmud Muhtar's manoeuvring element still had not made sufficient progress, hampered by the hard terrain, and thwarted by the reaction of the III/7 Battalion commander, Major Nikolaos Demestichas, who progressively sent out companies to extend the Greek left flank to the west and occupy crucial heights before the Turks arrived. At the same time, on the Ottoman left, Naim Pasha grew increasingly anxious about the situation of his forces, which were engaged already for seven hours without success, and pleaded with his fellow commanders to apply more pressure on their own front. The bad situation on Naim Pasha's front was exacerbated by the inept disposition of his forces: contrary to the advice of Mahmud Muhtar, he had strung out his entire force on an wide front, without keeping any reserves. As a result, Mahmud Muhtar and Suleiman Pasha decided to launch a frontal attack against the Greek left at Karadagh with the infantry they had held in reserve, and the seven cavalry companies, 300 men under Ibrahim Bey, were instructed to stand by to intervene at the \\"suitable moment\\". Balaclava charge at Velestino\\": the failed Ottoman cavalry charge of 30 April, drawn by John Charlton The Ottoman infantry quickly captured the first Greek line, while the Greeks withdrew to their second, main defensive position. Ibrahim Bey had sent an officer to the front line to determine the \\"suitable moment\\" and give the signal for the cavalry to attack; the officer did so at that point, when it was clearly premature, as the line of the Greek infantry had not yet been broken. Consequently, at 13:00 the Ottoman cavalry began to move into position to attack: a first echelon of two companies under Colonel Mahmud Muhtar were tasked with penetrating the Greek positions at the western slopes of Panagia height; Ibrahim Bey led a second echelon of three companies to the left and rear of the first, to assist it in its breakthrough; and a third echelon of two companies followed to the right and rear as a reserve force. While Mahmud Muhtar's first echelon successfully reached the slopes of Panagia and turned south as planned, the second echelon missed the turn and continued advancing to the east. When Ibrahim Bey realized this, it was too late: if he tried to turn south, his men would suffer heavy casualties to the entrenched Greeks on its flank. Thus he ordered his bugler to signal the retreat north. The third echelon followed suit, returning to the positions it had started from. This left Mahmud Muhtar's first echelon, already charging against the Greek trenches west of Panagia, alone and without any support. The Ottoman attack reached the Greek trenches, with some of the cavalrymen fighting with their sabres or dismounting to shoot at the defending Greeks; in the end, the Ottomans were forced to retreat by the heavy fire of the well-entrenched infantry. At about the same time, at 13:30, the Bursa battalion attacked the second Greek line on Karadagh, defended by IV/7 Battalion. By 15:00, the Ottoman troops found themselves separated from their comrades in the six outflanking companies by a single trench still held by the Greeks. The Greeks, with good artillery support, managed to force the Ottomans to withdraw, leaving two artillery pieces behind. In the meantime, the six outflanking companies launched five successive attempts to break through or outflank the Greek positions, without success. At 16:30, the Greek III/7 Battalion's 2nd company launched a fierce counterattack which forced them back, leaving 40 dead. With the Greek positions intact, at 16:30 Naim Pasha and Mahmud Muhtar ordered their forces to retreat towards Gherli. By 18:00, with the Ottoman withdrawal in full effect, fire ceased. Although the day had been a success for the Greeks, the Greek commanders, committed to the doctrine of passive defence, completely failed to exploit the exploit their success by launching a pursuit against the strung-out Ottoman forces, even though they disposed of twice as much infantry (7,000 men) as the Ottomans. The counterattack launched by Major Kopsidas, if properly supported, might have destroyed the eastern Ottoman column, but the opportunity was allowed to be lost. The casualties of the two sides during the First Battle of Velestino were 138 killed and 254 wounded for the Ottomans, and 28 killed and 142 wounded for the Greeks. Second Battle of Velestino, 5‚Äì6 May Sketch of a transport of wounded Greek soldiers on stretchers from the heights to the railway line after the battle Smolenskis expected the Ottomans to try again on the next day, and therefore asked for and received ammunition and reinforcements in the form of the 1st Independent Infantry Battalion and three dismounted cavalry companies, which arrived on 3 May. On the Ottoman side, Mahmud Muhtar reported in person to Edhem Pasha in person on 1 May, and expressed the opinion that the bulk of the Greek army was at Velestino, recommending an immediate attack with greater forces. Edhem Pasha disagreed, recalled the units of the Cavalry Division to Larissa, and instead sent the rest of the 5th Division, under Hakki Pasha, to assume a defensive position at Gherli. In preparation for renewing the attack, the division was reinforced during the next days to a total of 17 battalions, 4 cavalry companies, and 4 artillery batteries, a total of 8,500 infantry, 24 guns, and 160 cavalry. The role assigned to the 5th Division was to keep the Greek forces at Velestino pinned in place, so that they could not come to the aid of the rest of the Greek army, which faced the main Ottoman attack around Farsala. By 5 May, Smolenskis' Mixed Brigade counted 11 battalions (7th and 8th Infantry Regiments, 1st Independent, 6th Evzones), an engineer company, three dismounted and one mounted cavalry companies, and three artillery batteries. At the nearby village of Ayvali, although not placed under Smolenskis' command until the morning of 6 May, was the 4th Evzone Battalion and a mixed sapper-firemen company. In total, the Greek forces numbered 10,228 infantry, 150 cavalry, and 18 guns. The Greek dispositions did not change much since 30 April, except that Smolenskis appointed 8th Regiment commander, Colonel Nikolaos Giannikostas, to command his right wing, while 7th Regiment commander Lieutenant Colonel Stylianos Reglis assumed command of the left wing. =5 May= On 5 May in the morning, the Ottoman 5th Division began to move towards Velestino in four columns. Its rightmost (western) column, with the 2nd Infantry Regiment and one mountain artillery company, marched ahead, so as to engage the Greek left and prevent a possible Greek withdrawal towards Farsala. Furthermore, the column was to again attempt the flanking manoeuvre around Karadagh that had been attempted on 30 April. The central column, comprising the heavily reinforced 3rd Regiment (six battalions) and three artillery companies, was to attack the heights directly west of Velestino, while the 4th Regiment formed a left column and marched towards Ovrias Gala. The cavalry formed a separate column between the central and right columns, while an infantry regiment remained at Gherli as reserve. In total, the Ottoman forces deployed for the day's attack were estimated at 6,000 men, two batteries, and small numbers of cavalry. The Ottomans deployed for battle at 9:00, and by 9:30 captured the Petroto height in front of the positions of the Greek left wing, while other detachments passed through the ravines of Karadagh to try and outflank the Greek positions. The remaining Ottoman columns did not seriously probe the Greek positions. Around 10:00, as the Ottoman forces had approached the Greek positions on the left, a sudden rain and hail storm broke out, reducing visibility to almost zero. The Ottomans exploited this to approach the Greek lines even closer, and managed to occupy some Greek trenches. This led to a brief panic on the Greek front, but order was quickly restored by the officers. As the storm passed after 10:30, the fighting resumed. The Greek batteries were particularly exposed, as the Ottoman artillery had greater range and could fire at them with impunity, and they were forced to cease fire. Nevertheless, aided by gradual reinforcements from the 1st Independent Battalion, the Greek line held against repeated Ottoman attacks. The Ottoman commander also fed 3.5 battalions as reinforcements into the attack, but to no avail. Ottoman artillery fire became more sparse after 18:30, and fighting ended entirely at 19:30. On the extreme Greek left, the Ottoman outflanking manoeuvre was stopped thanks to the timely intervention of two companies from the 4th Evzone Battalion at Ayvali. Already at 16:30, Hakki Pasha had sent requests for reinforcement of at least a brigade or even an entire division to Edhem Pasha. As the continued presence of the Greeks at Velestino might threaten the flanks of the main Ottoman army, Edhem ordered the 3rd Infantry Division and a reserve brigade to Velestino on the next day, but they did not arrive in time to play any role in the battle. The Greek forces retained their previous dispositions, except that the two companies of the 4th Evzone Battalion were withdrawn as the entire battalion moved to occupy the Ayvali pass to secure the Mixed Brigade's rear from the direction of Farsala. =6 May= Sketch of the European press correspondents and consuls leaving Volos as peace envoys to Edhem Pasha At 5:00 on 6 May, the Ottoman attack resumed, pushing against the Greek left with greater forces than the previous day, while applying pressure along the rest of the Greek front as well. Due to the withdrawal of the Evzone companies, the extreme Greek left flank was left exposed. Despite repeated requests of the III/7 Battalion commander, no reinforcements arrived, so that by noon, the Ottoman forces broke through and forced the Greek left to retreat. As the Ottoman forces did not force a pursuit, the Greek retreat did not degenerate to a collapse of the front. Once informed of these developments, Colonel Smolenskis ordered 7th Regiment to hold at all costs and sent two reserve companies to bolster its position, but they arrived too late. At the same time, Smolenskis was informed by telegram of the defeat of the main Greek army at the Battle of Farsala and its withdrawal to Domokos. Combined with the critical situation on his left, around 15:00 Smolenskis ordered the Brigade to start retreating, beginning with the more exposed units of 8th Regiment in the lower ground. Although the Greek retreat was somewhat disorderly, the Ottomans did not exploit the situation: once they captured the Greek left, they stopped to rest, and another rain storm that broke out around 16:30 helped cover the Greek retreat. The Greeks managed to break off contact with the Ottomans and retire without trouble to Almyros, while some of the units of the right flank withdrew to Volos, where they were picked up by ships of the Greek fleet. Velestino was captured by the Ottomans on 7 May, where Edhem Pasha met with the European consuls from Volos, who announced to him that the city had been evacuated by the Greek forces. As a result, Edhem sent only two battalions to occupy the city, while the 5th Division remained in the wider area of Velestino. The total casualties for the Second Battle of Velestino were 59 killed and 361 wounded for the Ottomans and 73 killed and 306 wounded for the Greeks. Aftermath The main Greek army withdrew to Domokos, where they began hastily setting up fortifications. The reinforcements that had been sent to Smolenskis' command‚Äî1st Independent Battalion, 4th Evzone Battalion, the dismounted cavalry companies, a field artillery battery and the sappers company‚Äîwere recalled to bolster the defensive position there, while the 3rd Brigade remained at Almyros for the time being, covering the coastal road. The Ottoman 5th Division resumed contact with the positions of the Greek 3rd Brigade on 17 May, but no clashes occurred other than a brief bombardment of the Ottoman positions by Greek warships. On the same day, at the Battle of Domokos, the right flank of the main Greek army was turned back. Without any available reserves, the Greek army was likely to be surrounded, so Crown Prince Constantine decided to again withdraw south. as a result, 3rd Brigade was ordered to retreat to Lamia. An armistice took effect on the next day, which was finalized on 3 June, ending the war. Amidst a string of humiliating Greek defeats, the successful ten-day defence of Velestino by Smolenskis stood out. Already during the battle, the press clamoured for promoting him to general and commander-in-chief, and contrasted his capable performance during the war with the general ineffectiveness of the military and political leadership. On 19 May he received a field promotion to major general and was placed in command of the 1st Infantry Division. He was decorated with the Grand Commander of the Order of the Redeemer, and was propelled to the status of a national hero. Already in 1897, the Municipality of Athens gave his name to a street, and he received honorary citizenships from several Greek cities. Medals and lithographs with his portrait were in widespread demand and prominently displayed for several years thereafter. This popularity was quickly used to launch his political career: Smolenskis was twice elected Member of the Hellenic Parliament for the Attica and Boeotia Prefecture, and he served twice as Minister for Military Affairs, in the 1897 Alexandros Zaimis cabinet, and in the 1903 Georgios Theotokis cabinet.

It is derived from tub√¢ (palm toddy) that has been aged for several months to several years. It originates from the Visayas and Mindanao islands of the southern Philippines. It is deep brown-orange in color and has a slightly bitter astringent taste. Description Bahalina is characteristically deep brown-orange in color due to the use of barok (also called tungog or tongog), the extracts from the dried bark (marka tungog or tangal) of certain mangrove species (Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata, or Vateria indica). The tannin-rich extracts prevent bahalina from souring, as well as adding a slight bitterness to the flavor. Bahalina differs from the lambanog of Luzon in that lambanog is distilled and does not use barok and is thus milky-white or clear in color. Bahalina has around 10% to 13% abv (20 to 26 proof), which is higher than tub√¢ (2%-4% abv). However it has much lower alcohol content than lambanog which has 40%-45% abv (80 to 90 proof). Preparation Bahalina starts with the manufacturing of tub√¢ (palm toddy), which is derived from the sap of coconut or nipa palm flower stalks that have been cut. The tub√¢ typically ferment first for a week or so in the bamboo gathering tubes left on the coconut tree. They are collected by the mananguete or manananggot (tub√¢-gatherers) and immediately sealed tightly in traditional glass jugs or carboys, carefully ensuring no air pockets remain. The barok is added during these steps, either when still in the bamboo tubes or during the transfer to the jugs. After about a day to a few weeks, the tub√¢ ferments into bahal, which is mildly alcoholic and has a sour-sweet taste. This can be consumed as is. To make bahalina, however, the bahal is filtered with cloth to remove the sediments (laog) and then transferred to a new jug. This is repeated daily for three months to ensure that bahalina does not ferment into coconut vinegar. After this process, the jug is then buried underground at least deep or stored in cool cellars for at least two more months before it can be ready for consumption. Cultural significance The traditional production of bahalina is widespread in the Visayas and Mindanao. It is sometimes characterized as a \\"poor man's drink\\", not because of its quality, but because it is relatively cheap in comparison to commercial alcoholic beverages. Bahalina aged from three to five years are usually preferred as they have a smoother taste. Bahalina does not taste like tub√¢ or bahal. Rather than the slightly sour-sweet taste of the latter two drinks, bahalina is slightly bitter and tangy. Bahalina is commonly drunk mixed with carbonated softdrinks which gives a sweeter dimension to the flavor, reminiscent of red wine. Bahalina, along with tub√¢, bahal, and other traditional Filipino alcoholic drinks are celebrated annually in the Eastern Visayas in a wine-tasting event dubbed as the \\"Oktubafest\\".

Her work focuses on wide ranging socio- and gender-political ideas including precursor work on selfie culture, and questioning the ‚Äòfree‚Äô environment online along with a continued scrutiny of social media, truth and identity. She is known for her gender-political work '400 Women' which took five years to create and comprises portraits by nearly 200 artists including Maggi Hambling, Paula Rego, Zoe Laughlin and Celia Paul. She studied at Winchester School of Art and at the University for the Creative Arts (formerly Kent Institute of Art and Design) where she has subsequently been a visiting lecturer. Her sister is the author Melanie Challenger. Exhibited across the UK and internationally, she's been an invited speaker at the Women Of The World Festival, UAL, RHUL, Glasgow, Oxford and Cambridge Universities. She has made documentary for the BBC,'My Male Muse' with poet Clare Pollard being chosen for Radio 4's 'Pick of the Year'. In 2017, she was invited to deliver the David Vilaseca Memorial Lecture at Royal Holloway University. After this lecture she was appointed a member of the Advisory Committee for the Centre of Visual Cultures at Royal Holloway.  Work  Challenger's first solo show was The Tamsynettes at Transition Gallery run by Cathy Lomax in Bethnal Green in March 2010. This is an ongoing work looking at stylised layers of beauty through mapping her corporeal deterioration over the course of her lifetime. The Tamsynettes yr 2 was shown as part of the Beaconsfield (Vauxhall, London) show 'Fraternise-the Salon' in May 2011, showing alongside Tracey Emin, Franko B, Damien Hirst, Mark Wallinger and Sarah Lucas amongst others. In 2006, she began developing the idea for 400 Women. Politically concerned with gender violence, 400 Women began for Challenger when she visited Mexico in 2006 and is focused on the murdered and missing women of Juarez (see Female homicides in Ciudad Juarez). Challenger brought together a critical mass of nearly 200 international artists including Maggi Hambling, Paula Rego, Zoe Laughlin and Celia Paul to address issues of mortality and the capacity of art to imagine the dead, violence and trauma, with the aim of re-personalising the individual from a statistic. The show premiered in November 2010 at Shoreditch Town Hall Basement space, London, supported by the Arts Council and Amnesty International. The site-specific installation was subsequently selected as part of the Edinburgh Art Festival 2011. 400 Women continues to tour internationally. In 2012 Challenger was invited to contribute to a new protest book in conjunction with Pussy Riot that was published by Rough Trade Records, Let's Start A Pussy Riot. She was one of several contributors including Yoko Ono, Judy Chicago, Carolee Schneemann and several rock and punk musicians. Challenger was the only artist to produce a new sculptural work for the book which consists of a highly coloured fully operational ducking stool, shown as a precursor work to Monoculture. From June 2012 ‚Äì February 2013, Challenger was in residence at Beaconsfield Gallery BAW in London under the curatorial direction of David Crawforth and Naomi Siderfin, where she began exploring cultural homogeneity and the 'selfie' portrait through her project Monoculture. In February 2013, Monoculture show premiered at Beaconsfield and consisted of new large scale sculptural works that explore the relationship between social media, sexuality and self-representation. The work was recommended by the Contemporary Art Society in April 2013. This work was supported by the Arts Council. Monoculture was then shown as part of the Edinburgh Art Festival 2014, where it has been described by the New Scientist as \\"mesmerising and horrifying in equal measure\\". Her project Twitter Chorus was a further development taken from the ideas behind Monoculture and was voiced for the first time in England in 2015 at the Southbank Centre. It was subsequently performed at the New Hall Art Collection, MEC, Cambridge University in November 2015 with anarchic performance group Gaggle. In March 2016 this work was staged on a dramatic scale with hundreds of voices from multiple choirs as part of the Chorus Festival, Southbank Centre. In 2016 she returned to Summerhall with new work HYPER BOWL which was developed and shown for their visual art festival programme, and written up in the Times as \\"the paramount, walk-in art for the age of Trump\\". Free The Pussy! is Challenger‚Äôs first curatorial exhibition, shown first at Summerhall alongside Pussy Riot's performance residency ‚ÄòRiot Days‚Äô during the Edinburgh Festival 2018. She made a series of new ‚Äòcuratorial‚Äô interventions including the controversial The Royal Pussy signage, Corridor Dancefloor and 40 second miaow clock. Challenger also collaborated with Yoko Ono in a reshaping text work of Ono‚Äôs 1985 song ‚ÄòHell In Paradise‚Äô and with punk artist Jamie Reid to create Putin Trampoline, from his protest poster Free Pussy Riot. She has recently been making a new body of work addressing female sexuality that sees a departure from previous projects. The series Before you. With you. After you. is confessional and personal, and draws upon her own recent history. The first sculpture of this series, Empty Nest, was unveiled ahead of her David Vilaseca Lecture entitled On Truth and displayed as part of the collection in the Royal Holloway University Picture Gallery.  Curatorial  In 2018, she curated her first exhibition, Free The Pussy! which sprang out of her previous association with Pussy Riot. The exhibition was predominantly made up of archive work from 2012 when the 'Riot' sent out their call to arms to the creative community, some of this work was also featured in the 'Let's Start a Pussy Riot' book. Artists featured in the Free The Pussy! exhibition were No Bra, Judy Chicago, Challenger herself, Billy Chyldish, Gaggle, Gera (Nadya Tolokonnikova's daughter), The Gluts, Hayley Newman, Yoko Ono, Miss Pokeno, Pussy Riot, Jamie Reid, John Keane, Layla Sailor, Wendy Saunders, Carolee Schneemann and Voina.

B. Ford at Azcon scrap dock Duluth,MN 27 June 2018 The J. B. Ford was a steamship bulk freighter that saw service for 112 years on the United States and Canada great lakes. The ship was launched in Lorain, Ohio on 12 December 1903 as the Edwin F. Holmes. The freighter was named in honor of Edwin Francis Holmes, an investor in the Hawgood & Avery Transit Co. and a director of the Hawgood & Avery Fleet in 1904. The Edwin F. Holmes sailed in the Commonwealth Steamship Fleet until 1911 when she was transferred to the Acme Transit Fleet (another of the Hawgood fleets). At the time of its scrapping was the oldest intact lake freighter still afloat. The ship was 440 feet long by 50 feet across the beam, with a depth of 28 feet. It was powered by a 1,500-horsepower triple-expansion steam engine, fed by two coal-fired Scotch marine boilers. The Ford had 12 hatches feeding into 4 cargo compartments. Although the Ford had not seen powered service since 15 November 1985, it served as a stationary cement storage and transfer vessel in South Chicago, Chicago, from 1987 until 2001. The vessel was towed to Superior, Wisconsin to serve in the same capacity. The Ford continued in this duty until 2006 when the JAW Iglehart, former fleet mate of the Ford, was retired from service and took over the Ford's duties in Superior. Wooden Nameboard from Steamship J. B. Ford on display at the Buffalo Harbor Museum in Buffalo, N.Y. The Ford was moved to a storage dock awaiting orders to scrap the vessel. The scrapping of the E. M. Ford, and the attempts to save that ship in 2008, generated public interest in the old steamers. In 2010 the Great Lakes Steamship Society (GLSS) was formed (and soon thereafter incorporated) with the intention of acquiring and preserving items of maritime heritage on the Great Lakes, with their first goal the preservation of the J. B. Ford. The GLSS achieved 501c3 non profit status in 2011 and worked to save the vessel until July 2014. When the GLSS effort began in 2010, the vessel's owner, Lafarge, deferred scrapping the Ford to allow the group time to get organized and put a real effort forward to preserve the ship. The effort failed due to increasing cost to stabilize and preserve the vessel, combined with a loss of interest in preserving it. As of July 2014, the GLSS was still working with the vessel's owners to recover artifacts and significant items from the vessel, particularly the forward cabins. The J. B. Ford was towed to the Azcon scrapyard on Friday morning, 9 October 2015. Notable events *December 12, 1903: Launched in Lorain, Ohio by American Shipbuilding Company as the Edwin F. Holmes *January 22, 1904 : Work on fitting out the new vessel was delayed by major flooding on the Black River; the Holmes broke loose from her moorings in the current, and was pushed into the opposite bank. She was not freed until 5 February 1904 when she was returned to the fit-out dock and work continued. *July 19, 1904 : The Steamer Edwin F. Holmes was backing away from the Northern Coal dock un-assisted by tugs when a wind blew her into the Booth's Line passenger Steamer America crushing in five of her cabins. The America was not damaged below the water line so she left Duluth, MN with supplies to make repairs underway. The next day the Holmes left Duluth, MN. *November 27-December 1, 1905 : While sailing in Lake Huron with a load of coal for Duluth, MN a tremendous storm hit the region. The Holmes made it safely to the Soo Locks but she continued on, not knowing the full intensity of the storm. The Holmes was reported overdue on 30 November 1905. Although her identical sister ship, the Umbria, sustained heavy damage to her forward cabins and navigation centre (requiring the crew to steer the vessel from the emergency steering station at the stern of the vessel as it limped into Duluth), the Holmes arrived undamaged in Duluth, MN on 1 December, sailing into the Duluth piers past the broken and battered wreck of the Pittsburgh Steamship Companies' SS Mataafa which had been wrecked trying to enter the piers. She had grounded and broken her back on the beach just a few yards from the shore. Nine crew-members of the Mataafa perished in the wreck, giving history the name Mataafa Storm. *November 6‚Äì11, 1913 : Two powerful storm fronts collided over the region creating a massive storm system. Powering through the first part of the storm the Holmes reached safety of the Locks. A day-long lull in the storm tricked many seasoned mariners into thinking the storm was over, and after venturing out into Lake Huron, weather conditions deteriorated to the worst on record, and the storm ended up causing massive losses. Twelve vessels sank with no survivors, 32 vessels were blown ashore around the region, and seven of these were completely destroyed. On the lakes 235 sailors lost their lives, with at least 36 more killed on land, making this the worst storm ever to hit the region. To date no storm has equaled the Great White Hurricane of 1913, in terms of either lake weather conditions, or loss of life and property. *October 9, 2015: Under tow by the Helen H. and the Minnesota, She departed the Superior Municipal Dock dock bound for Azcon Metals in Duluth Minnesota for scrapping.

The parish boundary with Heighington passes close to the edge of the east of the village, skirting the school's playing fields. The boundary follows Moor Lane across the railway line along the road to Branston Booths where it meets the B1190 and Car Dyke, and along the Branston Delph on Branston Fen, crossing the River Witham, becoming the North Kesteven and West Lindsey boundary. The section north-east of the Witham is called Branston Island, meeting Fiskerton, Stainfield and Bardney, passing Bardney Lock. It meets Potter Hanworth at Bardney Bridge and follows Branston Causeway (which becomes the B1190) westwards, skirting the north edge of Potterhanworth Booths. It follows the B1202 westwards for around a half mile, then skirts the southern edge of a wood, crosses the railway line and Little Gate Lane, then Sleaford Road (B1188). It meets Nocton west of Fox Covert, and crosses Bloxholm Lane at the point where Branston Lane crosses, and meets Waddington halfway between Bloxholm Lane and the A15. Mere Hall is around a mile to the north. It crosses the A15 south of the B1178 junction, and passing through the eastern section of the airfield. The boundary passes northwards through RAF Waddington, with the north-eastern section of the runway in the parish. It crosses the A15 at the northern edge of RAF Waddington, just off the point where it meets Bracebridge Heath. It follows Bloxholm Lane to the north, and skirts the northern part of Westfield Farm, where it meets Canwick. It crosses the B1188 where the pylons cross the road. east it meets Washingborough, following a small beck and skirting the north edge of the village.

There are rumors that Jackson showed up one day with a partly written song and talked Gibb into contributing to it. The date was probably in the summer of 2002. A fan said that Gibb has a demo recording of it, but Gibb himself would not confirm that any of this happened. Gibb explains: > \\"Michael Jackson and I were the dearest of friends, that's simply what it > was.

The more we got to know each > other the more those ideas entwined and it all came to this song 'All In > Your Name'.

The track is laid on the bed of the old BR Worcester, Bromyard and Leominster Railway line. The track runs from an old depot, close to the site of the old Bromyard station, and ends under a bridge near a hospital turned flat block. The bridge was constructed in 1877 and carries a lane. There are disused engines in sheds at the main depot and Linton depot. The present track was used for the disused sandstone quarry. History With a decrease in rail traffic the standard-gauge British Rail line was closed to passenger trains in 1964Passengers No More by G.Daniels and L.Dench and finally dismantled in 1965 under the Beeching cuts.Smith p.151-155 The station and station yard in Bromyard were originally purchased by Bill Morris, whose company 'Morris Coaches Bromyard', founded in 1966, ran a bus service in the area. Around this time the rights to the track-bed, running for about a mile towards the Linton Trading Estate, were also acquired. Sometime after then part of the old Bromyard station yard and the track bed were acquired by Bob Palmer, who formed, in 1978 a company limited by guarantee called The Bromyard & Linton Light Railway Association (no. 01354372).Companies House Soon after this date a single narrow gauge ‚ÄòJubilee- track‚Äô line was laid, on the old BR track bed, as far as the road bridge of Avenbury Lane, a distance of about .

Map of the Bromyard and Linton Light Railway In 1991 a registered charity (no.1025344) was formed to promote the railway and to preserve the stock.Charity Commission Initially some activity took place on the line, with some static open days, however various issues and problems have meant that the line today is only occasionally used by the owner. Some of the rolling stock is exposed to the elements, which is now beginning to rust or rot away, and can be seen at the Bromyard end of the line alongside the access road to the Station Industrial site (see photo of Mesozoic). Present It is unknown at this stage whether any action will be taken to renovate and upgrade the line and make this available to public access. The undergrowth is sometimes cut back, but the Station Industrial Estate now occupies the site of the original Bromyard station. The narrow gauge track remains in place.

Early life Robert and his twin brother William were born in London on 13 November 1859. They were sons of Andrew Shewan (1820‚Äì1873), a master mariner, and Jane (n√©e Thomson) Shewan (1822‚Äì1886). Career Shewan arrived in Hong Kong in 1881, in the employ of Russell & Company, which was then one of the largest mercantile companies in the Far East. He and Charles Alexander Tomes, who was a grandson of merchant David Hadden, acquired the infrastructure of that firm subsequent to its dissolution in 1891, and consequently created Shewan, Tomes & Co. in 1895. The new company formed the Green Island Cement Company and the China Light and Power Company, which generated electricity for Kowloon. He was subsequently dismissed from the latter by its principal shareholder, the Kadoorie family. Shewan was also the director of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and of many other local companies. In 1902, Shewan was elected as the representative of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in the Legislative Council. He also served as Consul for Chile at Hong Kong. Shewan was unsympathetic to the Canton-Hong Kong strike in 1925: he told the Daily Press that employers should punish those of their Chinese labourers who went on strike. He also posted a notice to his office clerks that stated that those who left and did not return by the next morning would be permanently dismissed. Personal life Shewan was married to Dorothy \\"Dolly\\" Kate Lucas (d. 1961), who was a daughter of William Lucas and former wife of James Marke Wood. Shewan died on 14 February 1934. He was buried at the Hong Kong Cemetery in Happy Valley, Hong Kong.

In the same period Read ran a parallel research project to understand how top sellers structured their Sales process when pursuing a simple product sale compared to a more complex solution sale. Instead of following the sales profession's ubiquitous sales funnel, top sellers were seen to use a less linear and more cyclical approach that emphasised customer intimacy. More importantly, the research documented specific approaches top salespeople applied which were not previously common knowledge. Other researchers and authors have drawn similar conclusions about the modern solution selling process.The Consumer Decision Journey by David Court, Dave Elzinga, Susan Mulder and Ole J√∏rgen Vetvik.

She probably believes Cecco has been unfaithful, so she repulses him; in the last line the two lovers conciliate. We can easily understand the sonnet is a parody thanks to the combination of popular common sayings and courtly love's typical words.

She is also a surgeon who practices in rural India. Her career in medicine has been a strong influence in her fiction. Life Kavery Nambisan was born in Palangala village in south Kodagu, India, in a politician's family. Her father, C.M. Poonacha, was at one time a Union railway minister. She spent her early years in Madikeri. She studied medicine in St. John's Medical College, Bangalore from 1965 and then studied surgery at the University of Liverpool, England, where she obtained the FRCS qualification. She worked as a surgeon in various parts of rural India before moving to Lonavala to start a free medical centre for migrant labourers. Nambisan works as surgeon and medical advisor at the Tata Coffee Hospital in Kodagu, Karnataka, and is the Chief Medical Officer for Tata Coffee. She has created several programmes for child immunisation and family planning for the rural communities. She is vocal in her critiques of urban centred health planning. Nambisan was married to Vijay Nambisan, a journalist and poet. She has a daughter, Chetana, from an earlier marriage to Dr K.R. Bhatt, which lasted eighteen years. Literary career Kavery Nambisan began by writing under her first married name Kavery Bhatt for children's magazines. She wrote stories for the now defunct children's magazine Target. She also contributed to Femina and Eve's Weekly. Nambisan has authored several novels for adults, each with widely differing themes. Her first book, published under the name Kavery Bhatt, The Truth (almost) About Bharat, is the story of a rebellious young medical student who runs away from medical college, and begins a cross-country road trip on his motorcycle. The book went out of print and was recently re-released. Her second novel, The Scent of Pepper (1996) was set in her birthplace, Kodagu and is a portrait of the life and culture of its people, through the eyes of a family from colonial rule to independence. Mango-coloured Fish (1998) concerns a woman whose marriage has been arranged to a man she does not love. On Wings of Butterflies (2002) is set in the women's movement in independent India and narrates the story of a group of women entering politics. The Hills of Angheri (2005) draws from Nambisan's own experiences as a doctor, tracing a young woman's medical career. Her sixth novel,The Story that Must Not Be Told was shortlisted for the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature in 2012, as well as the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2008. Her seventh and most recent novel, A Town Like Ours (2014) is an account of the lives of several people, narrated by a sex worker living in a small town, and engages with themes of identity and industrialisation. Nambisan's story Dr Sad and the Power Lunch was joint runner-up in the third Outlook- Picador non-fiction contest in 2003. She has also contributed fiction to Indian Literature, the journal published by the Sahitya Akademi (India's National Academy of Letters). She has also contributed some works of criticism, including a piece on 'New Issues in Fiction' to the journal Indian Literature.

Biographies are intended for a wide audience of scholars, independent researchers and practitioners. Essays cover a wide range of figures, from Buddhist masters to artists and political officials, most of which are peer reviewed. Website localization into Tibetan and Chinese languages in is progress in order to meet the growing numbers of users active in those languages. The Treasury of Lives is a collaborative resource with over 100 contributing authors. The Treasury has published over 1100 biographies. Many essays are peer-reviewed and benefit from extensive internal and external links to associated art, maps, place descriptions, family and clan information, and timelines. The Treasury of Lives was originally known as The Tibetan Lineages Project, lead by Moke Mokotoff, Matthieu Ricard and Vivian Kurz. Alexander Gardner, Ph.D., serves as the Executive Director and Editor in Chief. The Treasury of Lives is also closely linked with Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC, formerly known as TBRC). The late E. Gene Smith and Jeff Wallman of the BDRC were instrumental in defining the vision of the site and in forging the plan for its development; and its database is closely linked to BDRC.

The by- election was held due to the death of the incumbent Conservative MP, Commodore Douglas King. It was won by the Empire Free Trade Crusade candidate Ernest Taylor.http://www.leighrayment.com/commons.htm Paddington South in the metropolitan area, 1885‚Äì1918 On Wednesday 20 August 1930, King's cutter yacht Islander sank in a gale near Fowey, Cornwall. All six aboard, including King himself, were lost. The South Paddington Conservative Association turned to its usual supply of candidates, the representatives of the constituency on the London County Council, and invited the 66-year-old Sir Herbert Lidiard (Chairman of the Association for the previous 16 years) to be their candidate, an invitation which Lidiard accepted after some reluctance. The Labour Party entered the contest with Dorothy Evans, Secretary of the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries. Interest was however already aroused at the prospect of the United Empire Party of Viscount Rothermere contesting the byelection. One constituent wrote to The Times to report that he had been canvassed by the party. On 15 September, the party announced that Mrs Nell Stewart-Richardson would be its candidate. At this stage it also seemed likely that there would be a Liberal candidate, although the local association quickly announced that it did not intend to sponsor anyone. Meanwhile the Empire Free Trade Crusade, normally allied with the United Empire Party but failing on this occasion due to Lord Beaverbrook's dislike of Mrs Stewart-Richardson, met with Sir Herbert Lidiard who pledged his support for Empire Free Trade but refused to go into Parliament with his hands tied. The Empire Crusaders then resolved to request the Conservative Association to choose a different candidate. When Lidiard declared that he would break the whip to vote in favour of Empire Free Trade, a statement welcomed by Beaverbrook, Neville Chamberlain wrote to him asking for clarification; Lidiard replied stating that he took this position in order to preserve the unity of his local association. In consequence, official Conservative endorsement was withdrawn on 30 September. This decision led the United Empire Party to withdraw its endorsement from Mrs Stewart-Richardson, although she refused to withdraw from the election. However, Lidiard and the Conservative Association tried to forge a compromise by passing a resolution (6 October) which declared that Lidiard realised that only loyalty to the Conservative Party would see Empire Free Trade enacted. A few days later, Conservative Central Office decided to restore official support and the writ for the byelection was moved. The volte-face by Lidiard incensed Beaverbrook who organised a meeting of Empire Crusaders on 17 October at which Vice- Admiral Ernest Taylor was adopted as the Empire Crusader candidate. Lord Rothermere also pledged his support for Taylor. There was a lively campaign with a great attendance and much heckling at public meetings in support of the various candidates. Beaverbrook and Rothermere's newspapers strongly supported their candidate. Vice-Admiral Taylor soon eclipsed Mrs Stewart-Richardson as the principal right-wing challenger to the Conservative, despite her insistence on standing even \\"if an Admiral or anybody else came and took her policy\\"; the South Paddington division had one of the highest proportions of women voters in the country. Lidiard was accused of having broken his pledge by a questioner, in a meeting which ended with blows being struck. The Labour Party also turned up outside other election meetings with loudspeaker vans, and made a special attempt to canvass domestic servants in the many large houses in the constituency. Because of the interest, the count was switched from the Thursday night following the poll, to the Friday morning at Paddington Town Hall. The poll on 30 October saw a turnout of 60%, higher than normal in such an area, and the police were much in evidence to ensure order (3,000 people lined Westbourne Grove to hear Vice-Admiral Taylor). Shortly after noon, the result was declared with Vice-Admiral Taylor winning by 941. Taylor said the result was a great blow \\"to those wobblers who, while not opposing [Empire Free Trade], are afraid to adopt it\\". Lidiard hit at the press, saying that he had been beaten \\"by the most intensive press campaign of abuse and misrepresentation ever known in any by-election in our political history\\", and asserted that \\"the electors have been misled\\". Labour polled just over a quarter of the vote.

It was built in small numbers. Design and development The Grifo single-seat trainer was intended as an improved version of the Teichfuss Nibio I. It was a braced high-wing monoplane, with a single spar wing. Apart from full rounded wing tips the wing was rectangular in plan, with plywood covering from the spar forward around the leading edge forming a torsion resisting D-box. Aft of the spar the wing was fabric- covered. Ailerons occupied more than half the span. The wing was held over the fuselage on a pedestal and braced on each side by a pair of parallel faired struts to the lower fuselage. The Grifo's fuselage was a ply covered wooden hexagonal structure with deep sides. The open cockpit, fitted with a small windscreen, was immediately ahead of the pedestal which dropped rapidly away to the upper fuselage behind the trailing edge. All the tail surfaces were straight-tapered and straight-tipped, with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and carrying unbalanced elevators. The fin was small but mounted a large, balanced rudder which extended down to the keel, working in an elevator cut-out and provided with a protecting tail bumper. The Grifo's landing skid, equipped with rubber shock absorbers, was short, only reaching as far aft as the forward wing strut. The Grifo first flew in 1934. Three were built and used by flying clubs.

Background and business career Percy Hobson Holyoak was the son of the Rev. T. H. Holyoak of Chesham-Bois, Buckinghamshire, England. He first arrived in Far East as a member of the Reiss & Co., a well-known Manchester trading firm in Hong Kong since 1864. He moved to Hong Kong in 1899 and was in charge of the Hong Kong office as a managing partner. He subsequently took over the firm with P. W. Massey when it suffered in the commercial slump in 1921 and 1922 and altered the name to Holyoak, Massey, & Co. with Holyoak as the senior partner. Holyoak also held positions in many leading public companies. Among others, he was the chairman of the board of directors of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for three times, chairman of the board of directors of the Hongkong, Canton, and Macao Steamboat Company, Ltd., chairman of the Union Insurance Society of Canton, and director of the Hongkong Telephone Company. Public services Holyoak was the chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in from 1917 to 1918 and 1920 to 1921. He was nominated as unofficial member of the Legislative Council as a representative of the chamber on the death of E. A. Hewett in 1915 and later on was appointed to the Executive Council for various times. Despite being a large contributor to the raising funds during the First World War, in early 1917 Holyoak moved in the Legislative Council to exclude German merchants from the colony for ten years, mandated by the Chamber of Commerce. In 1919, he and Henry Pollock formed the Constitutional Reform Association of Hong Kong to demand London for a further representation in the colonial legislature. He also associated with the Chinese community in public work such as his chairmanship of the Joint Committee of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce which supervised the arrangements for the Hong Kong section of the Wembley Exhibition. Among other public offices he was chairman of the Hong Kong Club and Alice Memorial Hospital, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Y.M.C.A., president of the Scout Association of Hong Kong, member of the Court of the University of Hong Kong and Justice of Peace from March 1909.

From 2011 to 2017, he was the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism. Emmerson is currently an Appeals Chamber Judge of the UN Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals sitting on the Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. He has previously served as Special Adviser to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, and Special Adviser to the Appeals Chamber of the ECCC (the UN-backed Khmer Rouge Tribunal in Cambodia). In his legal practice, Emmerson has acted for a number of foreign Governments in connection with international armed conflicts, including the Governments of Croatia, Cyprus, Georgia and Ukraine. He has also represented several current and former heads of State and other political figures, including Mohammed Nasheed (former President of the Maldives); Ramush Haradinaj (former Prime Minister of Kosovo); Arseny Yatsenuk (former Prime Minister of Ukraine); and Carles Puigdemont (ex President of Catalonia). He has appeared in numerous cases in the European Court of Human Rights, acting for and against the Government of the United Kingdom and other Council of Europe Member States, and has appeared in the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court and other international courts and tribunals. Emmerson's former clients include WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (in connection with an attempt to extradite him to Sweden); GCHQ whistleblower Katharine Gun (who was prosecuted under the UK's Official Secrets Acts following the 2003 invasion of Iraq); and Marina Litvinenko (the wife of former Russian FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who was assassinated in London in 2006 using the radioactive isotope Polonium 210). Emmerson also represented Abdelbasset al-Megrahi (the Libyan intelligence officer convicted of the Lockerbie bombing) in his appeal against conviction in Scotland, and subsequently acted for Abdullah Al-Senussi, the former head of national security to Colonel Gaddafi, in proceedings before the International Criminal Court. Within the UK, Emmerson has been a deputy High Court Judge, a Master of the Bench of the Middle Temple, a Visiting Professor of international law and security at the University of Oxford, and an Honorary Fellow of Mansfield College, Oxford. In 2016, he was awarded an honorary PhD from Bristol University. Emmerson has been described by former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May, as \\"one of the UK‚Äôs most distinguished lawyers in the field of national and international human rights law\\". He has also variously been described as the \\"b√™te noire of the right wing press\\", a lawyer with a \\"leviathan intellect\\"; and the human rights industry's equivalent of trade union leader Len McCluskey. Early life, education and early career Born in Kent, his father Brian Emmerson was finance director of the Stock Exchange in London. He attended Douai School and Bristol University, and was called to the bar in 1986. Until 1999 Emmerson was a member of Doughty Street Chambers, but in February 2000 he left to join the new Matrix Chambers which specialises in human rights. In April 2000 he was appointed Queen's Counsel. In January 2019, he moved to Monckton Chambers.  International appointments  In June 2011, Emmerson was elected by the UN Human Rights Council as UN Special Rapporteur on Counter Terrorism and Human Rights. He held this mandate until July 2017. In this capacity he reported annually to the UN General Assembly, the UN Human Rights Council and relevant entities established by the Security Council. He also conducted country visits and reports, and provided technical and other advice to states. He produced reports on the counter-terrorism policies of Saudi Arabia, Chile, Sri Lanka, Tunisia and Burkina Faso. His first thematic report, published in 2012, concerned the human rights of victims of terrorism. The report was welcomed by Amnesty International, which commended his decision to \\"promote better recognition and respect for the human rights of victims of terrorism\\". He also produced reports on the use of armed drones for counter- terrorism operations in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Palestine, accountability for the torture of terrorist suspects, human rights violations committed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria, electronic surveillance, terrorism and migration, the impact of national security measures on civil society, and the UN's counter- terrorism sanctions regime. Emmerson is currently the British judge on the UN Mechanism of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. He has previously acted as Special Adviser to the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court and Special Adviser to the international judges of the UN backed Khmer Rouge Tribunal in Cambodia.  Notable cases  In 1998, Emmerson successfully represented the claimants in the groundbreaking case of Osman v United Kingdom, a seminal decision of the European Court of Human Rights that first established the principle that a State owes a positive obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights from the criminal acts of a private individual. The case concerned the fatal shooting of a man in London by a teacher who had become obsessed with the victim's son. It was alleged that the police had failed to heed multiple warning signs, or take necessary action to prevent the murder, and that the British courts had failed to provide an effective remedy for the police negligence. The Court held that the United Kingdom had violated the victims‚Äô rights to a fair hearing through the grant of an effective legal immunity to the police, shielding them from legal liability in the tort of negligence, and awarded damages for the breach. The following year, he successfully challenged the UK government's ban on homosexuals serving in the military, when he represented two homosexual members of British armed forces at the European Court of Human Rights. The UK government was ordered to pay compensation and subsequently reversed its policy. The Guardian called it an \\"historic decision\\". while David Pannick QC called it \\"a welcome victory for reason over pure prejudice\\". In 2003, Emmerson represented Islamist cleric Abu Qatada, along with a number of inmates of Belmarsh Prison, at a joint hearing of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, challenging their indefinite detention, without charge or trial, on national security grounds. The case (reported as A. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department), went to the House of Lords, which held that the indefinite detention of foreign terrorist suspects without trial was in breach of Articles 5 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the UK's derogation from its obligations under the Convention was invalid because it was discriminatory and disproportionate. The decision established key principles about the relationship between the judiciary and the executive. Lord Bingham, the Senior Law Lord, held that the House of Lords was entitled to overrule the decisions made by Government and Parliament in that case, observing that \\"the function of independent judges charged to interpret and apply the law is universally recognised as a cardinal feature of the modern democratic state, a cornerstone of the rule of law itself\\". Lord Neuberger, former President of the United Kingdom's Supreme Court, identified it as one of the five most important public law cases ever decided in the United Kingdom, noting that, until then, it was \\"unprecedented for a court to hold a provision of primary legislation unlawful\\". The case subsequently went to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg which upheld the decision of the House of Lords, adding that the secret nature of the procedure was unfair to the accused. In a subsequent decision arising out of the same case, Emmerson successfully argued in the House of Lords that the detention of terrorist suspects could not be justified by reference to evidence obtained by acts of torture committed abroad by the agents of a foreign state. Between 2005 and 2012, Emmerson successfully defended Ramush Haradinaj, the former Prime Minister of Kosovo, on war crimes charges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague. According to Vanity Fair magazine, Emmerson \\"called no witnesses of his own, and relied entirely on shredding the evidence presented by the other side\\". Following Haradinaj's acquittal, the Prosecution successfully appealed, and the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY ordered a partial retrial, which concluded in November 2012, with Haradinaj's acquittal a second time. Haradinaj was subsequently re-elected as Kosovo's Prime Minister in 2016. In 2014, Emmerson was appointed Counsel for the Independent Panel Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in England and Wales. On 29 September 2016, Emmerson was suspended and then resigned from the position. It later emerged that an allegation of sexual assault had been made against him, but an inquiry by a senior judge ruled that the allegation was unfounded. According to the Guardian newspaper, human rights campaigner Baroness Helena Kennedy, welcomed the ruling, saying: \\"I have known Ben for many, many years. He‚Äôs a feminist. He lives as he speaks. He had discussed this matter with me. He‚Äôs not someone who takes liberties with people. I shared his shock when a public allegation was made. I‚Äôm satisfied that it was ill-founded.\\" At the time of Emmerson's resignation, his colleague, Amal Clooney told The Times newspaper: \\"He is one of the most intelligent and talented lawyers I have ever worked with and he is one of the leading experts in the world in the field of human rights. His resignation leaves a huge gap that will be very difficult to fill.\\" In 2015 Emmerson represented Marina Litvinenko, wife of Russian ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, at the public inquiry into his murder in London in 2006, using a radioactive isotope, (Polonium 210). Emmerson argued a successful judicial review challenge to the British Government's refusal to hold a public inquiry to examine the responsibility of the Russian State for Litvinenko's murder. According to Chambers UK, \\"forcing a public inquiry [was] down to the sheer force of his personality\\". At the completion of the public inquiry, the judge, Sir Robert Owen, found that the Russian State was responsible for ordering the murder, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin had \\"probably\\" given his personal approval to the killing. Following the publication of the Inquiry report, Emmerson described the murder as an act of \\"nuclear terrorism\\" and called on Prime Minister David Cameron to take effective action, saying that a failure to respond would be a \\"craven\\" abdication of his responsibilities. An official spokesperson for the Prime Minister commented: \\"The conclusion that the murder was authorised at the highest levels of the Russian State is extremely disturbing\\" and promised to take effective action in response. In 2016, Emmerson was appointed to the legal team representing Mohamed Nasheed ‚Äì the first democratically elected President of the Maldives, who was deposed and then imprisoned by the regime of President Yameen Abdul Gayoom. Following a successful claim to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Nasheed took refuge in the UK. Emmerson was subsequently appointed as international envoy for the Maldives opposition in an unsuccessful attempt to seek dialogue through the UN. In 2018, however, the opposition led by former President Nasheed won democratic elections in the Maldives and returned to power. In 2018, Emmerson took the case of Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, to the UN Human Rights Committee, arguing that the Government of Spain had violated his right to participate in political life through a \\"repressive\\" legal crackdown, following an independence referendum in Catalonia in October 2017. Launching the case, Emmerson said: \\"Spain is holding a sword of Damocles over the head of the Catalan people, implementing a strategy that is designed to cower them into submission\\". He also took up the case of several prominent Catalan politicians and civil society leaders at the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, arising out of their imprisonment in Spain on charges of sedition and rebellion for their part in the 2017 referendum. The same year, Emmerson appeared at the European Court of Human Rights in two inter-State cases against the Russian Federation. The first case, brought by Georgia, alleged that Russian forces and their proxies in the separatist movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia committed war crimes during the invasion of Georgia in 2008. At a hearing on 23 May 2018, Emmerson argued that Russian troops were guilty of multiple violations during a \\"rampage\\" across Georgian territory in which Russia's aim was to \\"occupy as much territory as it could get away with\\". During 2018, Emmerson also represented the Government of Ukraine in inter-State litigation arising out of Russia's annexation of Crimea, and its sponsorship of the war in Eastern Ukraine. Emmerson has advised Rohingya victims of human rights violations in Myanmar, and Yazidi victims of human rights violations committed ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Writing Emmerson was the founder editor of the European Human Rights Law Review and is co-author, with Professor Andrew Ashworth QC, of Human Rights and Criminal Justice (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Edition), the leading text on the application of the Convention in criminal cases. From 1995 to 2015 he was the human rights editor of Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, Evidence and Practice (Sweet & Maxwell).

It also had to place a stone in front of the building saying: \\"East Cliff Pavilion presented to the town of Herne Bay by Thomas Dence 1902.\\" Dence would pay up to ¬£2,000 for erection, fixtures, and the builder's invoices. Due to a new estimate by the Council surveyor and to site-preparation costs, Dence finally agreed to pay ¬£3,745 in all, although the final cost as announced at the Pavilion's opening was ¬£4,000. The completed building was handed over formally by Dence to the Council on Easter Monday, 4 April 1904. Dence was an entertaining speaker, as can be seen by the speech he gave on Opening Day. He said that \\"the original design of the building was a rough sketch by his daughter, with all the features he sought to include in the building. This was handed by him to Mr Palmer . . . who prepared the present design in all its manifold details.\\" He said to great applause that the Pavilion was \\"built so strongly and solidly, and on such good foundations that it was likely to stand the fierce north- easterly breezes for generations yet to come,\\" and that \\"while the East Cliff Pavilion remained, Mr Palmer's name would ever remain.\\" He said that Mr Ingleton's building work had done him great credit and that he \\"must have put the best materials in it for the love of it.\\" On the subject of the popularity and health-giving properties of the town, he suggested to much laughter that because 1,000 and 1,400 persons were listed in the town directory in 1902 and 1904 respectively, Herne Bay could have 200,000 inhabitants in the year 2000.Actual Herne Bay population was 35,188 in United Kingdom Census 2001 He wanted to press for gardens and walks on the East Cliff, and for a nearby park.As of 2013, the cultivation of the East Cliff as gardens has not happened, but there is a park in the centre of Herne Bay, date unknown. =Mr F.W.J.

Upon this foundation the superstructure was erected.\\" > From a speech by F.W.J. Palmer at the opening of The Pavilion, 4 April 1904 Under all walls there was a damp course of fibrous asphalt. The outer walls were of red and hard stock bricks with dressings of Victoria stone and facing bricks of Whiting's best reds The roof was made of rolled steel joists covered with sheets of expanded steel lathing, supplied and fixed by the New Expanded Metal Company, and the lathing for the ceilings was of sheets of this expanded metal lathing but of a smaller gauge. of coke breezed concrete was laid over these sheets, then of Val de Travers Mastic Asphalt was laid on top in two layers. =Completed pavilion 1904= Almost finished, March 1904 This is a red brick building with patent Victoria stone dressings surrounded by a verandah of iron columns. In 1904 all the windows had Venetian blinds, and all the rooms were ventilated by Boyle's fresh air inlet ventilators. There were gas brackets in every room. It had wide entrance doors: three doors with moulded panels, patent floor springs and brass fingerplates, and swing windows in the top panels. The windows were glazed with British polished plate glass. The window over the doorway had a heron and border painted on cathedral glass.The heron symbolises Herene Bay The lobby had moulded corner posts and panelling, and a moulded cornice. Beyond the lobby was a central hall by by high, with a dado of tinted, glazed bricks. The hall ceiling had a ventilated roof lantern which doubled as the base of the bandstand above. There was tongue and groove wood flooring laid on by joists, and a brown glazed brick skirting, a dado and salmon‚Äìcoloured walls. Today as in 1904 the ceiling appears panelled, being broken up by girders supporting the roof, and supported by \\"ornamental iron columns with moulded bases and capitals;\\" the form of the ceiling lantern remains, but is unventilated. The walls still have the original pilasters with capitals to match the central columns. In 1904 the hall had a high platform stage with moulded panels and corners. Above that was a Victoria stone memorial tablet saying: \\"This pavilion was presented to the town of Herne Bay by Thomas Dence Esq., 1903. Architect F.W.J. Palmer C.E., surveyor to the Council. Builder A.S. Ingleton, Herne Bay\\". Opening Day, 4 April 1904 On the right or west side of the main hall was a \\"well-lighted\\" ladies' retiring room by by high, with tongue and groove flooring and plainer walls than in the main hall. Through a lobby was the ladies' lavatory with six basins and a patent hot-water geyser, plus \\"every sanitary convenience\\". On the left or east side of the main hall was the gentlemen's reading room, somewhat larger than the ladies' at by by high. The men's lavatories had a urinal and the \\"usual offices\\" supplied by Adam & Co. of London, and a granite-paved floor. Both lavatories had white glazed brick walls to a height of with a \\"border of one course of tinted moulded bricks, and a skirting of four courses of tinted bricks, the top course of which is moulded.\\" Water came from the Herne Bay Water Company's main in Beacon Hill to a large cistern, and this supplied the handbasins, the nine water closets and the inside and outside urinals. The most \\"up-to-date\\" drainage system was provided, but this was the only item not detailed in the newspapers. There were \\"spacious and comfortable male and female attendants' rooms, with every convenience\\". Through a door at the south-west corner of the main hall (now the vestibule) there was a York stone staircase to the roof and road, with deep by high by wide treads and a wrought iron handrail. The terraced roof, which as of 2013 still exists, was intended for promenade concerts with an audience of 700. It runs over to cover the verandah supported by iron columns and ornamental ironwork supplied by MacFarlane & Co of Glasgow in 1904 and still visible today. The bandstand (demolished 1969) had a \\"roof supported by slender iron pillars and fenced with elaborately designed ironwork.\\" At the east and west of the building there were Victoria stone drinking fountains (the eastern one was still visible as of 2011). The walls, wood and ironwork were painted with Velure.Trove Queanbeyan Age (NSW: 1907‚Äì1915) 15 March 1910 p.3, Article about Velure paint. Retrieved 22 November 2013 =Opening 1904= Key presented to Dence by Ingleton, 1904 The Pavilion was opened at 3pm on Easter Monday, 4 April 1904. Thousands of spectators stood outside, and 300 invited persons squeezed into the little hall (now the vestibule). People pressed their faces against the windows or stood in a \\"dense mass\\" on East Cliff, and the door was guarded by Mr Boorman the Town Beadle in \\"sober uniform\\". The Pavilion was decorated with streamers, and flags including the Union Jack, the French Tricolour and the US Stars and Stripes. The Band of the Corps of the Royal Engineers was conducted by Lieutenant Summer in the bandstand on the roof. Inside the hall, flags were arranged around the walls and over Dence's memorial tablet awaiting the unveiling ceremony. The platform and its table were piled and surrounded with flowers. The band stopped, the audience stood, and the Council dignitaries processed onto the platform, headed by Chairman of the Council G. Farley JP, CC, with Mrs Dence on his arm, and guest of honour Thomas Dence who drew special applause. Proceedings were begun by a child, thus: Opening Day 1904 by Fred C. Palmer > \\"First a pretty little girl dressed in white, with a felt bonnet to match, > from which looked out a pair of dark eyes, and brown ringlets strayed upon > the shoulders, a very picture of a charming maid of Kent, stepped forward, > tripped her way onto the platform and presented Mrs Dence with a beautiful > bouquet, which was received with a smile by the lady, and the gift repaid > with a kiss; while those present loudly applauded.

He said, to applause, that he \\"hoped all would do their duty in maintaining and preserving it for the purpose for which it had been granted to the town\\". Mr Ingleton the builder presented a silver-gilt key to Mr Dence. On the front it bore an enamelled plate showing the heron,Herne Bay's emblem the clock tower and Reculver. The reverse of the key bore the inscription: \\"Presented to T. Dence Esq., donor of the East Cliff Pavilion, Herne Bay, by A.S. Ingleton, April 4, 1904.\\" Palmer the architect explained the building's construction (detailed above), then Thomas Dence the donor gave a long and much applauded speech (also detailed above). An unnamed person unveiled the plaque commemorating Dence's gift, and the Clerk to the Council read and presented an address of thanks, engrossed and illuminated on vellum, to Dence. Various councillors followed that with speeches of mutual thanks and compliments, and the band on the roof ended the ceremony with God Save the King. Refreshments were provided in the gentlemen's reading room for the invited 300, who then joined the crowd on the roof to hear a concert by the Royal Engineers Band.Herne Bay Press 9 April 1904 p.8 King Edward VII Memorial Hall =Mr A. Hardy the builder= Mr A. Hardy of Woking, with his company Hardy & Co., was the contractor for the construction of the second phase of The King's Hall in 1912‚Äì1913. The main challenge in this project was the ground work, since a large mass of the cliff had to be removed. The firm had already carried out previous works for the Council amounting to ¬£20,000, plus important projects for the councils of Strood, Frimley, Farnham, Woking and Chertsey. Other council works carried out in 1913 were for Kirkby, Portsmouth, Woking and Blean. In 1913 the company accepted a ¬£30,000 contract for Whitstable's town main drainage works complete with house, pumping station and outfall works. In respect of The King's Hall, all the ground-work, ferro- concrete work and decorative work was done under supervision of P. Taylor and G. Breward. =Building= King's Hall 2011 In 1913 the Pavilion was developed as a memorial to the late King Edward VII. The architect was again the Council surveyor F.W.J. Palmer who presented his plans in April 1911. The Council applied to the Local Government Board (LGB) for a loan,The Local Government Board enquiry took place at Herne Bay Town Hall on 24 October 1911. and the work cost ¬£6,000: ¬£5,000 for the excavation and construction; ¬£1,000 for furnishings. ¬£5,956 was received from the LGB in August 1912. The builders were Hardy & Co. of Woking whose tender of ¬£5,578 on 16 September 1912 was accepted for the erection work, and one of the contractors was electricity company Hunt & Sons of Charles Street, Herne Bay, who ran a cable underground from their works, beneath Canterbury Road and through the cliff. The entertainers Rouse, Way & Wilson made an advance investment of ¬£700 in the theatre, the profits to be shared by the Council. The excavation commenced in October 1912, and \\"many thousands of yards of London Clay\\" were removed to extend the building into the cliff. The 1904 building was incorporated and extended as a theatre, concert hall and dance hall below the Downs on East Cliff, and the existing small auditorium became the vestibule for the new hall. The 1913 Hall was designed to accommodate 1,500, with 1,100 in the open- air theatre on the roof. The high price for this build partly reflects the large excavation into the cliff for the Hall, and the early use of ferro- concrete, with steel bars made by the Spiral Bond Bar Company, who had patented the process that they used in the same year.Canadian Intellectual Property Office patent CA 151993 in ferro-concrete construction Retrieved 11 November 2013 The building was specially designed not to interfere with the view from houses on Beacon Hill to the south; nevertheless a flagstaff was erected between the Hall and the Beacon Hill estate. Ceiling rose ventilator, 2011 At a size of long, wide and high, the Hall provided space for seating 1,500. In 1913 the ceiling was plastered with a cornice and a \\"deep frieze of a delicate tint, and a picture moulding\\" around three sides of the Hall; this has now been replaced. The four main reinforced concrete roof beams create five ceiling bays, and in each bay are three plaster centrepieces representing vines and grapes. These are ventilator-covers. The middle one of each three originally carried copper bronze electroliers with chains and Holophane reflectors. (Today, more numerous and bigger lights are fixed there.) The walls were originally largely of glass and painted in eau de nil or pale green, with a darker shade on the dado. The special dance floor was rock maple over concrete, and the acoustics were said to be \\"perfect\\". There was a further tiered seating area on the roof for 1,100 deckchairs facing the cast iron bandstand and linking the roof with the Downs. The roof was \\"illuminated by five electric light standards, and the columns, the upper ornamental part of the bandstand, and the ribs of the bandstand roof [were] picked out with fairylights.\\" The box office in the vestibule was \\"artistically designed . . . of brick faced with plaster in the Georgian style.\\" The marble plaque on its front was carved by Emil Fuchs who had designed the King Edward VII Coronation Medal.Quoted on Tate website: Retrieved 11 November 2013. Ronald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.227‚Äì8 The old tongue-and-groove wood flooring of the vestibule was now replaced with terrazzo paving, with the town crest decorating the area in front of the kiosk (today this is covered over, or possibly removed). Over the Hall's exit doors (now removed) and over the kiosk were bullseye glass circles. The roof without bandstand, 2011 The original 1913 stage incorporated a faux cottage standing on an apron platform against the south wall of the Hall. After Herne Bay's two other theatres were burned down in the 1920s, The King's hall consequently had to take on all the large concerts. The little cottage stage was seen to be inadequate, and a large stage with proscenium arch was built at the east end of the room. The faux cottage and apron were eventually dismantled.Herne Bay Times 31 March 2005, p.14: \\"Past Times: From dances to wrestling, plays to concerts, The King's Hall has seen it all\\" With the old \\"cottage\\" stage against the south wall and the four large concrete ceiling-beams running north-south, the acoustics had been considered perfect. However the positioning of the new stage against the east wall caused some of the soundwaves to be blocked or diverted by the same beams which now crossed their path, so that the audience never again experienced satisfactory acoustics. However the Hall's original maple dance floor was \\"considered by some to be one of the best in Kent\\". The original seating of the Hall consisted of several rows of tip-up chairs in green plush, and the remaining chairs were of fumed oak. =Opening 1913= Preparations King's Hall 1913‚Äì1914 Queen Alexandra, the king's widow, agreed that the building should be renamed \\"The King Edward VII Memorial Hall\\". The previous 1904 opening had been a comparatively small affair because no VIP guest could be permitted to overshadow the donor, Mr Dence. However, because the 1913 phase was built on a government loan and there was no donor to thank, this Opening Day could a big event, involving the late king's sister and the whole town. It took five sizeable committees to organise everything: the General Committee which included the Funds Committee, the Luncheon and Reception Committee, the Decorations Committee (including the builder and architect of the Hall), the Publicity Committee and the Children's Committee (including local priests and teachers). The Hall was opened on 10 July 1913 by Princess Beatrice, sister of the late king, then titled Princess Henry of Battenburg. All public premises, private business and private houses along the route were decorated: > There was a series of triumphal arches at various points along the route, > and a series of Venetian masts, entwined with various coloured cloth with > evergreen at the base. From the tops of these, streamers of flags crossed > the streets, and the effect altogether was very pleasing. The most notable > arches were those outside the Town Hall and on the East Cliff at the north > end of Beacon Road; while those at the corner of Station Road and High > Street, at the corner of William Street and Mortimer Street attracted a > great deal of attention. These were Venetian masts, and on the red bunting > forming the cross pieces were appropriate mottoes in white lettering. The > Fire Brigade arch on the sea front formed of the two escapes, with the steam > and manual engines at the base, and ornamented with the hose, jets and flags > and canvas buckets was much admired. When the Princess passed the members of > the Fire Brigade stood on the escapes. The Princess had made a special request for local children to be involved in the ceremony. The schoolchildren of Herne Bay, Herne and Reculver, aged five to fourteen years, were assembled at their Council schools at two o'clock where they were each presented with a flag and a souvenir bronze medallion. The front of the medallion bore a representation of the medallion plaque of Edward VII in the Hall. The obverse said, \\"King Edward VII Memorial Hall, Herne Bay. Formally opened by Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Battenburg, Thursday July 10th AD 1913.\\" The medal had a red, white and blue ribbon designed to be worn around the neck. Carrying flags and accompanied by their teachers, the Girl Guides and the 1st Herne Bay Troop of Boy Scouts with their bugle band, they marched to the Downs where in due course they were presented to the Princess. Reception at railway station King's Hall, 1927 Princess Henry's royal train of five carriages left Victoria at 10.45 am, and steamed in to Herne Bay at 12.26 pm, with her saloon carriage stopping exactly at the red carpet, to be met by an escort of soldiers presenting arms and Fusiliers playing the National Anthem. The Princess wore a grey brocade dress, with a cuirass bodice of a darker shade with gold embroidery. Her cloak was entirely of grey beads and ornamented with black silk braid, and she had on a black hat with stone-grey lancet plume feathers. Mr Knollys in the \\"magnificent uniform of the City of London Yeomanry\\" presented Sir Mark Edlmann Collet, High Sheriff of Kent, \\"who was attended by two footmen in gorgeous livery and bearing silver-tipped wands.\\" The High Sheriff in turn presented various council, ecclesiastical and mayoral personages to the Princess, and she was given a bouquet. Gathering at the station to meet the Princess at the station were \\"territorials in scarlet and buff and the New College Cadet Corps in more sober khaki with bayonets fixed,\\" along with 4th Company F Battalion The Buffs, East Kent Regiment \\"in their scarlet and buff uniforms.\\" They were joined by a squadron of mounted 6th Dragoon Guards who were to provide the guard of honour and travelling escort \\"with glistening helmets and tossing plumes and flashing swords.\\" Taking centre ground to provide the music was the Band of the Second Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers \\"in full dress with their busbies\\".In fact the Fusiliers were more likely to have been wearing bearskins, but these terms have always been popularly confused in the UK The station was \\"decorated with flags and a covered way laid with red carpet had been prepared from the gateway on the right of the booking office. All round were flags, which had plenty of life in the fresh, southerly breeze.\\" Processions Pier entrance and Grand Pavilion, 1910‚Äì1928 The first of two processions from the station to the Hall included five carriages full of above-mentioned VIPs and the Princess, the military escort and band, and a lot more soldiers; this procession made a carnival-like circuit of Herne Bay. The second procession, which went straight to the Hall, consisted of sixteen more carriages. The first of the sixteen contained Reception Committee members including Council personages and a judge. The second contained local vicars. The third to twelfth carriages carried councillors and their wives; the twelfth included Council surveyor JWS Palmer and his wife. The thirteenth and fourteenth carriages contained mayors and mayoresses of Ramsgate, Margate, Faversham and Canterbury. In the fifteenth carriage was the Chief Constable of Kent, and in the sixteenth were the chairman and Clerk to the Council with their wives. The Princess's route to the Hall was designed so that Herne Bay was viewed by her to advantage, and so that the public had a good view of her and her escort. Her procession was cheered by crowds all the way. She travelled via Station Road, High Street, New Street, Victoria Park and The Avenue to the Cottage Hospital where she was given a tour, where the staff including Dr Tom Bowes were presented to her, and where she inspected Navy and Army veterans. Back in her carriage, she then processed along Canterbury Road, Mortimer Street, William Street and the sea front, where the Pier entrance was decorated with flags and flowers. At the square by the Pier, Herne Bay Fire Brigade formed a fire escape arch \\"with the men in position on their ladders, their helmets in the brilliant sunshine glistening like gold against a sky of Italian blue.\\" At the Pier Pavilion the 6th Dragoons played music including H.M.S. Pinafore while she and members of the Council enjoyed a French menu at a lunch prepared by a Kensington caterer, the only potentially local source for ingredients being Pate de Pigeon. A local quartet sang the Grace, followed by toasts and long speeches. They all then circled via the sea front, Canterbury Road, Beltinge Road, Sea View Road, Beacon Hill Parade and Beacon Hill back to the East Cliff for the opening ceremony at 2.50pm. During the procession the National Anthem was played at least eight times: twice at the railway station; twice at the hospital; twice at the Pier and twice at the Hall. Public ceremony Kings Hall, 1920s By the time the Princess arrived at the Hall, the roadside crowds had gathered at the site, where the Fusiliers were playing in the bandstand, the 6th Dragoon guard of honour was marshalled at the south-east corner, and all the local schoolchildren were lined up on the north side, including New College cadets, Herne Bay College cadets from St George's Terrace, the Scouts and Guides, and the Council scholars in red, white and blue caps and waving flags. On the east and west sides of the building were beflagged grandstands full of members of the public, and there was a dais for the Princess and VIPs on the north side. As the Princess arrived, the National Anthem was played yet again, then the children sang it unaccompanied (following much rehearsal). On display were uniformed Scouts and Guides, members of the National Reserve, Army and Navy veterans wearing their medals and \\"Friendly Society men in their distinctive regalia\\" There were speeches by various dignitaries. The enrobed Clerk of the Council read and presented a crested and illuminated address, inscribed on vellum and scrolled on an ivory roller, to the Princess. The address was presented in a ferro-concrete casket to match the fabric of the Hall's 1913 build: > The casket was rectangular in form, embellished with wrought, silver > framing, surmounted by chiselled silver ornaments. On the front of the > casket, in a panel of wrought silver, appeared the arms of Her Royal > Highness; while on the reverse side were the arms of the Herne Bay Urban > District Council. The whole was surmounted by a silver crown. On the front > of the sloping lid was a silver plate inscribed, Presented by the town of > Herne Bay, July 10th, AD 1913. The interior was lined with silver-grey > velvet. Anon, Herne Bay Press 12 July 1913 The Bishop of Dover, attended by the vicars of Herne Bay and Herne, \\"all in full canonicals,\\" led prayers. Vestibule ceremony The Fuchs medallion, 2011 The Princess unveiled the medallion plaque of Edward VII in the vestibule. Carved by Emil Fuchs, it was described as a \\"most lifelike portrait of the late king.\\" The medallion itself was carved from Carrara marble and fixed to a framed panel of reddish-brown and white-veined rosso antico marble.Corsi collection of decorative stones: 61.

Marmor Alabandicum www.oum.ox.ac.uk/ Retrieved 19 November 2013 The frame was described as being \\"of a fine white free stone of a classical design.\\" The inscription on the panel said: \\"This medallion was unveiled, and this building formally opened, by Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Battenburg on behalf of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Alexandra by whose gracious permission it was named The King Edward VII Memorial Hall, July 10th 1913.\\" F.W.J. Palmer presented her with a gold key; she opened a door to the Hall and declared it open. After the ceremony the schoolchildren were marched back to their schools where they enjoyed a free tea and a sports day. The Princess and invited audience then listened to a grand concert in the very full Hall. The princess was cheered all the way back to the railway station, was presented with a gold replica of the Fuchs medallion and a keepsake by the Chairman of the Council, and left on the 4.30 pm train. For the locals during the rest of the day there was dancing in the Grand Pier Pavilion and various concerts including one by the mounted band of the 6th Dragoon Guards.Herne Bay Times, 14 April 2005, p.10: Past Times by Mike Bundock: How the opening of The King's Hall kept proceedings in the family Herne Bay photographer Fred C. Palmer was commissioned to provide postcards of the event, and his photographs were used in the local newspaper, the Herne Bay Press. King's Hall Entrance, 2011 By 1912, even before the ground-breaking in October of that year, the building was already being referred to as The King's Hall. Until the 1920s there were three theatres in the centre of the town: the Town Hall, the Theatre on the Pier (built 1884) and The King's Hall. However, in the 1920s the Town Hall and Pier Theatre burned down, leaving The King's Hall as Herne Bay's sole theatre.

As Town Surveyor between at least 1891 and 1915 he was responsible for digging up a great deal of Herne Bay. He reconstructed all the main roads, rebuilt the council offices and Hampton Pier and constructed a new sea wall. He sewered the East Cliff and nine miles of private roads at the east end of Herne Bay. His crowning achievement was his design of both phases (1904 and 1913) of the King's Hall, Herne Bay.Herne Bay Press 12 July 1913: \\"Royal visit\\" His extensive works helped to provide employment and to make the town what it is today.

So inside the Hall there were large windows, ceiling roses doubling as natural ventilators, and two large louvred natural ventilators at the corners.

Economy The primary source of wealth in Coreca, as well as in nearby Campora San Giovanni, is the tourism and hotel sector, developed thanks to the scenic coastline: popular are the Coreca Reefs, photographed since the 1960s and used by amateur radio enthusiasts. There are also some small factories where food, furniture and machinery are manufactured. Coreca on 1950s Hamlets From 2017 the territory of Coreca is divided into the following hamlets: { border=0  * Formiciche * Giascogne (in local dialect Juascugnu) * Grotte (in local dialect \\"i Grutti\\")  * La Pietra (in local dialect a Petraja) * Marinella (from 2011) * Oliva (from 2011)  *Stritture (belonging to Campora San Giovanni between 2008 and 2011) *Salto da Zita *Scogliera }  History  In antiquity, when the first Greek Corinthian settlers arrived, they named the place ŒöœåœÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÇ (Korakas), which means the place of the crows \\"because of the luxanyante reminiscent of the native Corinth and its many crows. But in the region there was no autonomous human settlement, but a sort of stopover with a small port, named Ager Caricum in Roman times and so designated on some maps until the early eighteenth century. This stopover is on the roads between Temesa and Terina for the Aeolian Islands - in fact the islands are located 65 miles from the coast of Coreca. Ager Caricum gave the old name in Corica2 dialect. The place remains a lookout point over the centuries, but does not develop, leaving the nearby Amantea and nearby hill towns like Aiello Calabro and Lago to get tired. The population comes down in part from some families from neighboring villages who have come since 1800 to settle in the current location. In 1943, Coreca was a strategic point for Allied operations, especially thanks to the Turriella, a fort of Arab-Norman origin, used by Anglo-Americans for Morse signaling operations. The current name comes from the Coreca Anglicization. The Tonnara gatehouse, nowadays in ruins, was of strategic importance. In the fifties, given the shortage of work and the misery of the post-war period, the inhabitants emigrated to Venezuela in the hope of a better future and a return to their native country. In the sixties, thanks to the economic boom and the revival of the Italian economy, Coreca is a tourist destination and for radio amateurs thanks to the privileged location of the rocks. On May 20, 1974, because of tourism, the locality has been promoted by presidential decree to the status of frazione. In the early 1990s, Coreca began to decline. The lack of relevance of various facilities and services, favoring the nearby Campora San Giovanni and the municipal capital. In 2008, the frazione annexed by municipal decree the territory of Marinella, Oliva and Stritture, and expanded in size from to . A private broadcaster (Radio Coreca), one of the first pioneers of private broadcasting, lasted a short time and closed in 1996. Beginning in 2013, a slow but excellent revival and awareness began to resuscitate Coreca, thanks also to local youth and other cultural associations in support of Coreca.  Monuments and places of interest  = Church of Our Lady of the Angels = On October 1, 1964, work began on the construction of the Church of Coreca, which is be dedicated to Our Lady of the Angels, the work ending in 1965 in the presence of the authorities of the time. The church is of modern but sober style, able to hold 65 people. Every year during the patronal feast (August 22) there is a procession through the central streets. = Square Madonna degli Angeli = On April 2, 2003, the municipal resolution was passed and on 5 May 2005, the works began for the construction of the central square in order to host the summer events of the hamlet. Since 2015 it is named after of Madonna degli Angeli for the proximity to the little church and also for the presence of a small niche with a statue of Our Lady. The square is handled, cleaned and maintained in a communal use by a local tourist association since 2013. = Coreca's Caves = The iron mines of ancient Temesa are very important in the area. During World War II they were used as a refuge for local residents and for Anglo-American soldiers who used them as warehouses. Later the caves were used for Christmas and Easter events until the early 2000s. = Tower of Coreca or \\"Turriella\\" = Tower of Coreca is located north of the village of Coreca, on the slopes of the Tuvulo hill. This tower, partly collapsed on the first floor, is of some historical importance. It is perceived as a crucible of styles that have been followed over the centuries and used mainly as a view of the Arabs, then Normans and various lords of the territory followed up to the arrival of Nazi troops and then Anglo-American troops in the Second World War. Turriella can be reached by the Tonnara road to the north and the road from Marinella to the south.

It was announced on 9 August 2013 and later an open beta was released on 12 November 2013 in Brazil and Russia. The open beta was made available globally on 20 May 2014, with support in English, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish and Turkish. Italian was included with the release of version 9.0 of the game on 5 November 2014. Players could play the game using their keyboard, a combination of their keyboard and mouse or a game controller. Like with the main releases of FIFA, Lionel Messi featured on promotional images and the title screen of the game. Arda Turan was announced as an ambassador for the game in Turkey on 27 August 2014, with Eden Hazard announced as another ambassador for the video game on 15 September 2014. FIFA World, along with other EA free-to-play titles Battlefield Heroes, Battlefield Play4Free, and Need for Speed: World, went offline on 14 July 2015. Releases After the release of the global open beta, EA Sports released version 6.0 of the game on 3 June 2014, with the game's interface redesigned to \\"bring the spirit and excitement of Brazil\\" in preparation for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. National teams were also included in the \\"Single Player Tournaments\\" mode of the game for the first time, while national team kits were also updated to reflect those to be used at the World Cup. Video sharing was made possible on the game when version 7.0 was released on 22 August 2014. Players are able to select highlights at the end of a match and share them with their friends in-game, as well as on Facebook or YouTube. On 1 October 2014, Electronic Arts released version 8.0 of the game, allowing players to make use of new items from the 2014‚Äì15 season in the Ultimate Team mode of the game, including new kits and updated player ratings from FIFA 15, while still allowing players to keep their old FIFA 14-style items from the 2013‚Äì14 season. Released on 5 November 2014, version 9.0 saw the introduction of an improved version of the Impact engine from FIFA 12, first announced at Gamescom 2014. New features included 2,000 new animations added to the gameplay and tactical free kicks introduced in FIFA 13, as well as new skill moves and celebrations. Six new stadiums were also added to the game, including Aston Villa's Villa Park, Swansea City's Liberty Stadium and Schalke 04's Veltins-Arena. Game modes =League Teams= Chelsea playing against Barcelona on FIFA World. The League Teams mode of the game allowed the player to use any of the licensed clubs and national teams to progress through a promotion and relegation system within the game from Division 10 to Division 1. Every match played counted for one of five match credits allocated to each player. These match credits replenished over time after being used, and could also be purchased using \\"FIFA Points\\", the in-game currency of all FIFA titles. The game featured the same leagues, clubs and national teams licensed for FIFA 15, although the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A and Brazilian clubs were removed from the game in September 2014 due to a failure to reach an agreement with the rights holders. The Turkish S√ºper Lig and all 18 S√ºper Lig clubs were also introduced to the game for the first time with the release of version 8.0 on 22 August 2014. =Ultimate Team= An example of a pack opened on FIFA World, including two Team of the Week or \\"in form\\" items. The Ultimate Team game mode allowed players to build unique squads within their club using players bought from the live transfer market or acquired in packs, which could be opened using coins earned in matches or \\"FIFA Points\\". Packs could also be earned by completing certain in-game accomplishments. Players could use their squads in online seasons, where players competed against other players and progressed through a promotion and relegation system from Division 10 to Division 1, or in single-player seasons where players played against the game's licensed clubs controlled by the AI. Every week, a team compiled by EA Sports based on real-life player performances was released, where the players in these squads were represented as special black items with upgraded attributes. These were made available in packs for the rest of the week until a new \\"Team of the Week\\" is released. Players could also customise their club's badges, kits, match balls and stadiums, extend their players' contracts, change their playing positions or temporarily improve their attributes using items acquired in packs or the live transfer market. Commentary Martin Tyler was a commentator on the English-language version of the game. The game adapted its commentary from FIFA 15, with commentators available in the 10 supported languages on the game. * British English: Martin Tyler and Alan Smith * Brazilian Portuguese: Tiago Leifert and Caio Ribeiro * French: Herv√© Mathoux and Franck Sauz√©e * German: Frank Buschmann and Manni Breuckmann * Italian: Pierluigi Pardo and Stefano Nava * Polish: Dariusz Szpakowski and W≈Çodzimierz Szaranowicz * Russian: Yuri Rozanov and Vasiliy Soloviev * Spanish: Manolo Lama and Paco Gonz√°lez * Mexican Spanish: Fernando Palomo, Mario Kempes and Ciro Procuna Closure On 15 April 2015, EA announced they would be shutting down FIFA World servers on 14 July and turning off services for the game with immediate effect, after an open beta of nearly 18 months. A statement from a representative read: \\"We just didn't have the momentum to bring the game to a full commercial launch. It's a tough decision, but we believe ultimately the right one, that we stop development on the game.\\" Battlefield Play4Free, Battlefield Heroes, and Need for Speed: World were also due to be closed on the same day. The decision was not reversed and the game was closed on the anticipated date.

Early history Since earliest times humanity has endeavoured to develop the most appropriate systems of organization to meet the challenges of a particular era. Inevitably the systems of organization that developed were reflections of the wider values, tradition and general organization of society at that time, moulded by the necessity of withstanding threat and seeking to innovate whilst maximising benefits from existing resources. Human development has continually necessitated a corollary of human and organizational development designed to maximize effectiveness. This progression is indicative of a civilizing process that has continually asked humanity to reassess its relationship with itself and to increasingly value the welfare of both the individual and wider society as a whole.Pinker, S. 2011. The Better Angels of Our Nature: A History of Violence and Humanity. London. Penguin. The symbiotic relationship between strategic leadership and organizational structure necessary to success can be traced back to the beginnings of western civilization. Indeed, the very term strategic owes its etymology to the ancient Greek words for 'army' or a 'large body' and a 'leader'. In ancient Greece the 'Strategikos' was the leader of the army.Adair, J., 2002. Inspiring Leadership. London. Thorogood. Industrial Revolutions In 1776 the political economist Adam Smith wrote on how specialization can boost human productivity enormously.Smith, A. (1776). An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. By specializing, people can use their talents, or acquire skill. And they can employ labour- saving machinery to boost production.http://www.adamsmith.org/wealth-of- nations. (n.d.). Retrieved October 2013, 2013, from www.adamsmith.org. Smith's view was borne out by the effects of mass industrialization in the late 18th century which caused great change in how people worked and how work was organized. On this topic Lynda Gratton, the organizational theorist, describes the \\"fundamental and irreversible shift which changed the experiences of every worker.\\" She states that prior to the Industrial Revolution, work was an \\"artisan activity engaged largely in the home, using long held and meticulously developed craft skills.\\" According to Gratton these skills \\"began to be transformed as the manufacturing sector was developed and began to transcend the limits of artisanal production\\".Gratton, L. (2011). The Shift- The future of work is already here. London: Collins The late 18th and early 19th century was a period where the artisan and the agricultural worker gave way to the burgeoning factory units that were beginning to emerge. The enclosure of vast tracts of commonage in the countryside facilitated a move from pastoral farming to grazing ‚Äì forcing many from the land, often in dire circumstances. This growing trend of migration from the rural to the urban witnessed the growth of the metropolis, and the industrialized city. The growth of a mass society meant that the relationship with work was altered, it now became much more time centred and precise ‚Äì a standardized approach was in the process of being developed.Russell, B., 2001. Freedom and Organisation 1814-1914\\\\. 2nd ed. London. Routledge.Hobsbawn, Eric. 2003a. The Age of Revolution 1789‚Äì1848. London, Abacus. Alongside the migration of workers to the new factories largely situated around energy sources and communication networks ‚Äì coal deposits and canals etc. this period witnessed the emergence of global corporations situated in key centres such as London and Paris, as trade followed the flag in a wave of colonization. The shift from coal to oil as the primary energy source for industry coupled with the decolonization of empires in the 20th century would witness shifting paradigms in the power relationships between major states. The issue of empire is important in the sense that economic advantages accrued through imperialism were a cornerstone in the advent of modernity, and the enforced homogeneity achieved through Empire coupled with the technological improvements in transport and technology that it funded made the world a lot smaller and lot more similar.Hobsbawn, Eric. 2003b.

London, Penguin. Whilst recognising the significant impacts that the Industrial Revolution had, Gratton states that the \\"real revolution\\" in people's working lives began in the mid-to-late-19th century when British scientists drove a culture of innovation with the ideas of organisational and technological restructuring based on changes in the energy that powered industry.

Cities in Evolution. Williams & Norgate. According to Gratton: \\"Work became more regimented, more specialised. The workplace and the work schedule became more compartmentalised and hierarchical.\\" Gratton states that this was 'the embryonic stages of Fordism ‚Äì the rise of the engineer as the organiser of economic activity, and the decline of the artisan. Fordism Fordism, named after Henry Ford, is \\"a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor\\".Tolliday, S. &. (1987). The Automobile Industry and its Workers: Between Fordism and Flexibility. New York: St.Martin's Press. The major advantages of this approach was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate, not to mention that it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production.Burrows, R., Gilbert, N., & Pollert, A. (1992). Fordism and Flexibility: Divisions and Change. New York: St. Martin's Press. According to Gratton, \\"in this second Industrial Revolution, engineers redesigned factories to make employees fit into the production line. By doing so workers lost their autonomy, becoming simply as interchangeable as the parts they created\\". Whilst Fordism emerged in the United States, it was preceded in Europe by Taylorism.Maier, C. S. (1970). Between Taylorism and Technocracy: European Ideologies and the Vision of Industrial Productivity in the 1920s. Sage Publications. Taylor's main objective was to improve economic efficiency, especially labor productivity. He analyzed how specific jobs might be done more efficiently. He broke down manual tasks into a series of components that could be measured. Peter Drucker who, during the 20th century was known as the 'father of modern management' said that Taylor was \\"the first man in history who did not take work for granted, but looked at it and studied it. His approach to work is still the basic foundation.\\"Gurus ‚Äì Frederick Winslow Taylor. (2009, February 6th). The Economist. Post-Fordism Production methods based on Fordism are no longer the primary method of industrial production. There are three main driving forces behind the emergence of 'Post-Fordism.' They are the rising of new technologies, internationalization and the paradigm shift from Fordism to post-Fordism. Post Fordism is based on flexible production, rising incomes for polyvalent skilled workers and the service class and increased profits based on technological and other innovations. Also post-Fordism accumulation will be more oriented to worldwide demand, not so much on demand within a state. Post- Fordism is more demand than supply-driven. As a labour process, post-Fordism can be defined as a flexible production process based on flexible systems and an appropriately flexible workforce.Jessop, B.

Modernity The birth of modernity as it has been termed in the late 19th early 20th century presaged a period of incredible industrial, technical and intellectual advancement that was to completely alter mankind's relationship with and perception of time and space. Many of the technologies that we take for granted today can be seen as developments from scientific and technical breakthroughs achieved in the period between 1890 and 1920. The birth of the railroad (which dates back to the early 19th century), and later the automobile, was to lead to seismic changes in the manner and means in which the organization of the various units of human enterprise were to be restructured, from warfare to commerce. Mankind's new outer relationship with time would be best captured by the birth of the railroad Rodrigues C., Garrat, C., 2001. Introducing Modernism. London. Icon. and our inner relationship with time through the development of modernist literature, with its stream of consciousness.Walder, Denis. 2004. Literature in the Modern World: Critical Essays and Documents. 2nd ed. Oxford. OUP. The parallel growth of industrial capitalism would lead to the identification of time as money. The speed of travel would see the subsuming of local time-zones into railway times. The American Civil War is regarded as the first modern conflict, as notwithstanding the massive casualties and periods of trench warfare, the mass movement of men and munitions by rail provided the genesis for the logistical capability that would contribute to the mechanization of warfare inevitability leading to the slaughter of World War I. World War II World War II represents something of a tipping point in terms of its impact on the development of industrial organization and leadership. Just as the conflict precipitated incredible technological advancements in areas such as radar, computing and the development of the jet engine so it was for leadership models, particularly in the areas of communications and efficiency. The primary models and experience of leadership and organizational structure for the post war leaders of the business world were from the military in WWII, with the majority of Post War managers drawing on their military training as a model for organizational development. Post war management & organizational development Frederick Winslow Taylor's 1911 The Principles of Scientific Management paved the way for the recognition of management as a scientific subject, with the MIT Sloan School of Management opening in 1914. However, organizational theorists such as Charles Handy and Henry Mintzberg both decry the lack of leadership and management training in the post WWII period. Handy in particular records how in his early career as an executive he was forced to rely on his formal academic training in Roman and Greek Classics as grounding for his management training.Handy, C., 2007.

Social, technical, environmental & political forces as modern shapers The growth of 'gentle commerce' interspersed with political and social thought processes to the degree that by the late 20th century, in a globalized interdependent economy, cooperation between nation states and trading blocs is the norm (notwithstanding the obvious aberrations of the rule); thankfully humanity has advanced beyond Clausewitz' dictum that decreed war as no more than politics in another manifestation Clausewitz, C., 1993. On War. London. Everyman. to the degree that it is no longer acceptable for Democracies to use force to achieve political aims. Against this developing socio-political backdrop, organizations have continued to evolve. The contemporary zeitgeist suggests the developed world is primarily governed by social democracies, is hugely interdependent whilst engulfed in a tidal wave of endemic technological innovation and advances that will carry it into uncharted waters. All this alongside a growing sense of awareness of a global environmental threat, diminishing supplies of carbon fuels coupled in all too many instances with an existential crisis, that asks what is it all about? Contemporary organisational innovation A prime example of progression from the antiquated hierarchical structures with its layers of middle management staffed by gate keepers congesting the flow of communications can be found in the 2008 Presidential Campaign conducted by Barack Obama. Obama's team harnessed the potential of social media to create a flat structure. Local activists were communicated with directly from campaign headquarters. Individuals became leaders in their own domain. They were able to access campaign material, and register supporters immediately upon accessing material provided online via the campaign website. This innovative form of campaign allowed Obama to raise $750 million, primarily from small donors, along with registering one and half million volunteer campaign workers in twenty seven thousand campaign groups. However, following the appointment of Jim Messina as the campaign manager for the 2012 Presidential campaign the 2008 strategy was declared antiquated ‚Äì indeed Steven Spielberg reportedly advised Messina to blow up the 2008 campaign it was so out of date. In a future where any task that can be described as predictable or repetitive will invariably be delegated to forms of artificial intelligence, the old hierarchical command and control systems will become largely redundant. Success will be premised on speed and innovation, on the ability of organizations to synthesize real time information and perform strategic pivots that will allow immediate access to new opportunities. The 2012 Presidential election presaged how this may look in practice. Whilst the campaign remained grassroots oriented, continuing to harness social media, the engine behind the effort was a metrics driven campaign. The sheer magnitude of the data organizing effort was staggering, but all within one single comprehensive database.http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-14/obamas-ceo-jim- messina-has-a-president-to-sell.

Her mother was Theodora Asanina of the Asen family, a family which had once ruled Bulgaria. Famous for her beauty, Sultan Mehmed II, who had conquered Constantinople in 1453, planned to take her into his harem after his conquest of the Morea in 1460, but soon decided against it, despite securing Helena and her family, possibly due to fear of being poisoned by her. Instead of entering the sultan's harem, Helena received a pension and large estate at Adrianople, where she lived until her death of unknown causes 1469, only about 27 years old.  Biography  Helena Palaiologina, born 23 April 1442, was the daughter and only child of Demetrios Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea, a brother of Constantine XI Palaiologos, the final Byzantine emperor. Her mother was Theodora Asanina, the daughter of Paul Asan, part of the ancient Asen family, which had once ruled the Second Bulgarian Empire. At the time of Helena's birth, Demetrios was the Despot of Mesembria, not being appointed as the Despot of the Morea until 1449. In her time, Helena was famous for being beautiful and high-spirited. In 1455, two years after the Fall of Constantinople, Helena's father Demetrios attempted to arrange a marriage alliance with Aragon and Naples by betrothing Helena, then 13 years old, to a grandson of King Alfonso the Magnanimous. After Sultan Mehmed II, who had conquered Constantinople in 1453 and now ruled as the suzerain of Demetrios and his co-despot and younger brother Thomas, invaded the Morea in 1458 because he had not received the agreed upon tribute by the two despots, these marriage plans fell through. In Alfonso's stead, Mehmed proclaimed that he would marry Helena. From 1459 to 1460, Demetrios and Thomas fought a civil war over control of the Morea, which ended only with the intervention of Mehmed II and the annexation of both their territories into the Ottoman Empire. Whereas Thomas escaped into exile, Demetrios surrendered to the Ottomans at Mystras without a fight. Since he feared the sultan's retribution, Helena and her mother Theodore had already been sent to safety in Monemvasia. On 31 May, Mehmed II arrived outside Mystras and met with the frightened Demetrios, demanding Demetrios to recall Theodora and Helena from Monemvasia and yield them to the sultan so that they could accompany him to Adrianople. The sultan probably, at least initially, intended for Helena, now 18 years old, to enter his harem, and put her and her mother in the care of some of the eunuchs in his entourage. As per Byzantine historian Theodore Spandounes, Mehmed never married Helena:The reason for Helena never entering the sultan's harem is unknown, but it is possible that Mehmed II feared that the girl might attempt to poison him. Instead, Helena was provided with a pension and large estate at Adrianople by the sultan, though she was forbidden to marry. She died of unknown causes 1469, only about 27 years old, and both of her parents, so struck by grief that they retired to monastic life, died in the following year.

Born at Dunblane, Scotland in August 1851, he initially planned his career as a lawyer and received legal and commercial training in Dunblane and Liverpool.  Career  Whitehead joined the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China and became Manager of the Hong Kong branch in 1883 and Superintendent of its Far Eastern Branches in 1893. Whitehead represented the bank to the United States Government on the issue of maintaining the stability of Mexican dollars. He left Hong Kong in 1902 to take the bank's joint-manager in London. He was appointed unofficial member of the Legislative Council in 1890 and Executive Council in 1902. Whitehead held criticism to the incompetence of the Tung Wah Hospital during the Plague of 1894 in the Legislative Council. Whitehead also suggested a recreation ground to be built in Causeway Bay in the 60th year of the reign of Queen Victoria. In 1896, Whitehead sent a petition to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, asking for a more representative government in Hong Kong. In 1902 Whitehead again represented the Hong Kong ratepayers to send a petition to the Parliament in London for constitutional reform of the Hong Kong municipal government. Whitehead involved in the negotiations with the Chinese authorities in Peking and Canton over the Cassel loan of 1895 whereby Britain loaned the Chinese government a million pounds to help them pay the indemnity they owed to Japan after losing the First Sino-Japanese War. In 1900, the Qing Imperial Court appointed him as the Financial Adviser. In 1917 Whitehead was closely identified with the creation of the British Overseas Banks' Association (the organization later became the British Overseas and Commonwealth Banks Association in 1964), of which he became the first chairman. He was a prominent figure of the banking system until he retired in 1920. Whitehead was also a correspondent for The Times in Hong Kong and came into prominence in 1895 when he disclosed the secret treaty between China and Russia regarding the occupation of Port Arthur. Whitehead died in a London nursing house on 8 May 1933 at the age of 81. The cremation took place at Golders Green and interment at Dunblane.

Species =Mating system= Male grappling on top of the female in an attempt to force copulation Species of genus Gerris demonstrate a high degree of female control over most aspects of mating and there is significant evidence that supports antagonistic coevolution, and the convenience polyandry hypothesis of multiple matings. There is evidence to suggest that the post-copulatory guarding exhibited by Gerris buenoi - and other species of Gerris - is a form of a direct (material) benefit that females take advantage of to reduce superfluous matings. Water Striders (Gerris argentatus), weigh about 0.00002 lb created surface waves (Ripples) in a pond. The striders are out of focus (on purpose), but you could see their shadows, the hairs at their legs and the sun reflected from their footprints\\" - Brocken Inaglory. The ripples attract predators.221x221px Male persistence is often detrimental to female fitness as male species of Gerris harass females. This is believed to be the result of males having a lower number of available mates and therefore, have a reduced fitness. Females are at risk of predation during mating attempts as males mount the female in an attempt to mate and tap their legs on the surface of the water to attract predators. Females respond in turn, creating a pre- copulatory struggle in which they try to perform backwards somersault-like movements to break free of the male grapple. If unsuccessful, female species of Gerris will resort to mating with the male as the cost of rejecting the male advances (death by predation) outweighs the cost of mating out of convenience. An example of genitalia shielding and the courting that males do instead of the usual forced copulation attempts. As a result of the tactics employed by both species there is evidence of rapid evolution between the sexes in a persistence-resistance form of sexual conflict. The sexes of species of genus Gerris compete between each other in an \\"arms race\\" behaviour where males and females have varying traits that serve to increase their own fitness over the other. Males evolved to harass females by chasing and lunging in an attempt to grapple the female for copulation, and females evolved mechanisms such as genital shielding, evasive maneuvers, and attempting to fight even when grappled. However, evading and fighting are quite costly for females and will give in if the costs of resistance outweigh the cost of mating. Genital shielding can best be seen in G. gracilicornis and a male will have a hard time at inserting his genitalia unless the female protrudes her genitalia out. Males have evolved to overcome this mechanism by attempting an intimate courtship instead of forceful mating, as well as a more hostile approach: attracting predators to force mating with females. The rationale behind attracting predators to force mating is due to how copulation occurs: a male will attempt to mount a female on the surface water;it is the female that is at most risk from insect-eating fish and water dwelling predators. After copulation, males continue to rest on top of females for some period of time - this is what is known as guarding duration. It can be hypothesized that when superfluous matings are plenty, females will extend this guarding duration by allowing the male to rest upon her for some time which in turn prevents harassment from other males. It is worth noting that this also incurs costs for the female as they must exert energetic costs to compensate for the passive male on her back, and that this might not be an effective tactic for females in the long run. Water striders, and more specifically those that fall under the genus Gerris are a model organism for studying sexual conflict as they have clear costs associated with their actions. They have great use as a control group when comparing to other organisms where it is more unclear as what is occurring. =Former species= * Gerris ampla reclassified as Aquarius amplus (Drake and Harris, 1938) * Gerris apicalis Curtis, 1835 junior synonym for Gerris argentatus Schummel, 1832 * Gerris canaliculatus reclassified as Limnoporus canaliculatus (Say, 1832) * Gerris conformis reclassified as Aquarius conformis (Uhler, 1878) * Gerris dissortis reclassified as Limnotrechus dissortis (Drake and Harris, 1930) * Gerris mantis reclassified as Emesa mantis (Fabricius, 1794) * Gerris gracilicornis reclassified as Limnotrechus gracilicornis (Horvath, 1879) * Gerris najas reclassified as Aquarius najas (De Geer, 1773) * Gerris nebularis reclassified as Aquarius nebularis (Drake and Hottes, 1925) * Gerris nyctalis reclassified as Aquarius nyctalis (Drake and Hottes, 1925) * Gerris remigis reclassified as Aquarius remigis (Say, 1832) * Gerris rufoscutellatus reclassified as Limnoporus rufoscutellatus (Latreille, 1807)  References   External links  Gerrini Gerromorpha genera ","title":"Gerris"},{"id":"41167140","text":"In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, the Schur product theorem states that the Hadamard product of two positive definite matrices is also a positive definite matrix.

Clark was elected to an at-large seat on the Philadelphia City Council in 1979, becoming the second African-American woman to serve on the city council. (Ethel D. Allen, who served on the council from 1972 to 1979, was Philadelphia's first African-American councilwoman.) Clark served on the Philadelphia City Council from 1980 until her retirement in 2000. Biography =Early life= Clark was born Augusta Alexander on March 5, 1932, in Uniontown, Alabama, to Harrison and Lula B. Alexander. She was raised in Fairmont, West Virginia, and earned her bachelor's degree from West Virginia State College, now known as West Virginia State University. She met her future husband, Leroy W. Clark, while both were students at West Virginia State, though they did not marry until 1960, when both were living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The couple had two children, Mark and Adrienne. She had moved to Philadelphia after college for professional reasons. She was a member of the Bright Hope Baptist Church from 1954 until 2013. =Career= Clark moved to Philadelphia when she was hired as an assistant on the now defunct Color magazine. Color, which was based on Life magazine, was targeted for African-American readers. However, Color folded and went out-of business. Clark became a graduate student at Drexel University soon after the magazine's closure, where she received a master's degree in library science. She worked as a librarian in Philadelphia. Clark next enrolled at the Temple University Beasley School of Law when she was 39 years old and earned her law degree. Clark worked as on the election campaign of William H. Gray, who was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1978. Philadelphia community and political figures encouraged her to run for a seat on the Philadelphia City Council the following year. Augusta Clark was elected as a Democratic councilwoman-at-large in 1979, becoming only the second African-American woman to serve on the city council. Clark served on the Philadelphia City Council, representing a citywide at-large seat, from 1980 to 2000. She became the chair of the council's Education Committee for twelve years. She was known as a vocal advocate for the School District of Philadelphia. She was an opponent of school vouchers, arguing the program would remove money from the public school system. Clark allied with the then-President of the Philadelphia City Council, John F. Street, to pass a 10% liquor tax, which was used as an additional source of revenue for public schools. Clark chaired the Public Property and Public Works Committee and served as the city council's Democratic majority whip for a time. Clark retired from the city council in 2000. In a 2000 interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer, Clark explained that she felt it was the right time to retire, saying, \\"I think elected office is like poker...I think you have to know when to hold them and know when to fold them. And when you feel you have amassed a body of work that satisfies you.\\" Augusta Clark died at Lankenau Medical Center in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, on October 13, 2013, at the age of 81. She was survived by her two children, Mark and Adrienne, and four grandchildren. Her husband, Leroy W. Clark, died in 2007.

He aims to extend system dynamics and complexity theory to the social domain and presents \\"a conceptual framework that integrates life's biological, cognitive and social dimensions\\". Summary The book is divided into a theoretical part (chapters 1 ‚Äì 3) and a more practical part with application examples (chapters 4 ‚Äì 7). =Part One= The first part begins with an introduction to prebiotic and biotic evolution theory and highlights the importance of membranes in this context. The author then goes into the details of different theories on cognition, consciousness, language and social co-ordination. His claim is that all biological and social phenomena are the result of the network characteristic of life. Therefore, system dynamics is the appropriate tool for analysing such phenomena. In the centre piece of his book, Capra then proposes that life and social reality can be understood by applying a framework of four interconnected perspectives: form, matter, process and meaning. Capra believes that this systemic understanding can significantly advance other integrative social theories, in particular those of J√ºrgen Habermas and Anthony Giddens. =Part Two= The second part begins with a chapter on complexity and change, in which Capra presents a concept of management that recognizes the network characteristic of all human organizations. He explains how organizational learning and change can be facilitated by learning from life science. The fifth chapter is a profound critique of global capitalism. Capra takes up the research of Manuel Castells, who explains how globalization is shaped by modern communication technology and network phenomena. The author then explains that he sees the global market economy as an automaton with severe social and ecological impacts. Subsequently, Capra gives a detailed summary of the risks of modern biotechnology and makes a strong case against the dogma of genetic determinism. At the end of the book, the author appraises the rise of a global civil society, which he sees manifest in the 1999 Seattle WTO protests. Furthermore, he sees important potential in technological advances such as cradle-to-cradle design and hypercars.

Omegasome is a cell compartment consisting of lipid bilayer membranes enriched for phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (abbreviated PI(3)P or PtdIns3P) and related to a process of autophagy. It is a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and has a morphology resembling Greek capital letter omega (Œ©). Omegasomes are the sites from which phagophores form. Phagophores (also called \\"isolation membranes\\") are sack- like structures that mature into autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes in order to degrade the contents of the autophagosomes. The formation of omegasomes is increased as a response to starvation. Macroautophagy Illustration showing steps from omegasome to autolysosome. Autophagy (from Greek words for ‚Äúself‚Äù and ‚Äúeating‚Äù) is a process of digesting or degrading cytoplasmic molecules (proteins, lipids, sugars and organelles). Macroautophagy is the main autophagic pathway, used primarily to eradicate damaged cell organelles such as mitochondria, ribosomes, etc. The omegasome is present at the opening of the sack-like phagophore while items destined for degradation by macroautophagy are loaded into the phagophore. There are specific receptor proteins that recruit items to the phagophore. The phagophore expands to accommodate the items, until the omegasome is closed to produce the roughly spherical autophagosome. How autophagosomes are \\"detached\\" or \\"exit\\" from the omegasome is not clear, but autophagocytosis associated protein Atg3 and other proteins are required, and collections of thin tubules at the junction between omegasome and phagophore appear to be involved.

Berry had acquired the 40-year-old pipeline from Chevron Corporation in 1990 after it had been abandoned for 10 years. The line had been used to transport natural gas, yet Berry began to pump crude oil through it without making any upgrades. It was revealed that 10 months before the oil spill occurred, a safety valve that might have prevented the leak had broken and was not repaired. In August 1994, Berry agreed to pay $600,000 and pleaded no contest to a single misdemeanor charge of failing to report the leak. In addition, the foreman on duty during the spill pleaded no contest to a charge of illegally releasing oil into marine water and was ordered to perform 320 hours of beach cleanup.

Blodgett Peak is located in Pike National Forest. and at its base is Blodgett Peak Open Space of Colorado Springs. Overview The peak is located in the 167 acre Blodgett Peak Open Space along Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains, which is a wildlife habitat, including the peregrine falcons, and trails for hiking. The terrain contains Pierre Shale, Fountain Formation, and Manitou Limestone. Flora includes scrub oak, Douglas fir, and ponderosa pine. The peak is accessed from Woodmen Road in Colorado Springs. It is northwest by west (bearing 309¬∞) of downtown Colorado Springs. Mountain Blodgett Peak was named for a family that settled in an area now part of the Air Force Academy in the 19th century. It was the 1959 runner-up site for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Hardened Combat Operations Center to the command center built in Cheyenne Mountain. NORAD was particularly interested in a Colorado Springs location, and the Corps of Engineers recommended the selection of Cheyenne Mountain in March 1959. The Blodgett Peak was burned during the 2012 Waldo Canyon fire. After the fire, the Blodgett Peak Restoration Project was initiated to develop soil and erosion control measures, remove dead trees along trails, plant trees, and reseed vegetation. There was a combined effort of U.S. Forest Service crews, the Rocky Mountain Field Institute, Air Force Academy cadets, and the Mile High Youth Corp to restore the trails, remove hazardous trees, install log erosion barriers and other erosion minimization approaches, and plant trees and seeds. Funding was provided by Pikes Peak Community Foundation and Great Outdoors Colorado totaling $75,000 and additional monies raised by McCloskey Motors. A tour of the open space, including the undamaged areas, was conducted by the City of Colorado Springs Parks, Recreation & Cultural Services on August 29, 2013 and the open space area was reopened. The open space was one of the first areas affected by the fire to reopen. Hiking The main route, and the most accessible, starts in the Blodgett Peak Open Space and is approximately 5 miles round trip. The hike gains 2,400ft in elevation, with the trailhead starting at 7,158ft. In March 2015, a man attempting to hike to the top of the peak was reported missing by relatives. After search teams were sent out, the man's body was found off of the trail among a boulder field. The trail is noted to be hard to navigate, especially since the Waldo Canyon Fire has changed the landscape and notable landmarks for hikers.

Origin The Doi Kham Royal Project was begun when King Bhumibol Adulyadej visited Chiang Mai during the cool season in 1964. He had the opportunity to observe the problems of rural villagers. In the hilly northern region, farming was of the slash and burn variety and was causing the forests to be reduced to ashes. Also, the number of people growing opium poppies was increasing. At the king's command, the royal project was created to provide alternative sources of income for hill tribe villages that formerly relied on opium production and swidden agriculture. Name The meaning of the words \\"Doi Kham\\" comes from two northern Thai words. The word \\"doi\\" means 'mountain' or 'hill' while the word \\"kham\\" is a shortened word for \\"thongkham\\" which means 'gold'. Operations Doi Kham Factory mural painting in Songtham Pavilion at Royal crematorium of Bhumibol Adulyadej Doi Kham store at Thanon Phaya Thai The Royal Project Foundation operates four research stations and thirty-five development centres that work with 295 villages containing 14,109 families. Involved are approximately 85,000 rural Thais and hill tribe peoples. Doi Kham Royal Project, in Chiang Mai Province, is a wealth of flowers, herbs, fruits, and vegetables that are produced in order to increase the value of agricultural products and help the farmer gain more income. The company produces a wide variety of agricultural products including ready-to-drink fruit juices, fruit juice concentrates, dehydrated fruits, jam, honey, and flowers. Doi Kham exports 30 percent its output to the Asia Pacific region. The company objective is to support the development of Thai agricultural products and to produce goods which have a high nutritional value with no chemical additives. Their products do not contain preservatives or artificial flavors. Doi Kham Food Products is a private limited company. In recent years it has been profitable. In 2016, the firm had revenues of 1.82 billion baht. Projections for 2017 and 2018 are 2.07 billion baht and 2.4 billion baht. Doi Kham employs total of 200 persons including five engineers and five quality assurance staff. Doi Kham has processing plants in Fang District, Chiang Mai Province; Mae Chan District, Chiang Rai Province; and Tao Ngoi District, Sakon Nakhon Province. The company has 34 retail shops nationwide.

Grange Walk is a historic road in Bermondsey in the London Borough of Southwark, in south London. It runs between Tower Bridge Road in the west and Neckinger in the east. History Described as one of the prettiest roads in Bermondsey it contains numerous historic buildings and has associations with the demolished Bermondsey Abbey, which is perhaps most famous for being the last residence of Queen Elizabeth Woodville, mother of the \\"Princes in the Tower\\" and Elizabeth of York. Within the structure of the late 17th-century Grade II-listed houses numbered 5, 6 and 7 is part of one side of the late medieval stone gatehouse of Bermondsey Abbey. At number 7 is the Chamfered south jamb of the gateway with two wrought-iron gate-hooks projecting from the wall and a ‚ÄòGatehouse‚Äô sign. Numbers 5 to 11 form a group of historic houses and are found at the westernmost part of the road. At number 67 is a Grade II*-listed double-fronted Queen Anne house dated circa 1700. The road also contains the interesting Grange House, which sits at the end of a cobbled stone road surrounded by an unusual painted passageway. At the corner of Grigg's Place there is as a former girls' charity school of the 1830s, which still retains the words \\"Bermondsey United Charity School for Girls\\" inscribed in stone. The cobbled Bridewain Street towards the eastern end of the road used to lead to a dairy. Writing in 1873, author Edward Walton described Grange Walk (then known as Grange Road): > 'Grange Road, which was built on the pasture-ground belonging to the > monastery, commences near the south-west corner of the square, and extends > to what was till lately the Grange Farm, and continues onward to the ancient > water-course called the Neckinger, over which is a bridge, leading to the > water-side division of the parish...

Life Wilbrand was the son of Prince G√ºnter II of Schwarzburg-K√§fernburg, by his father's second marriage which was to the Princess Adelheid of Loccum- Hallermund/ In August 1209 Wilbrad was appointed Provost at the church of St Nicholas, Magdeburg, where he was appointed Domherr. In 1212 he moved to Bibra where he was appointed provost Provost, and between 1212 and 1226 he was active as Papal Subdeacon and Chamberlain. Through the intervention of his half brother, Archbishop Albert of K√§fernburg, he was appointed cathedral provost in Magdeburg in 1225. When Albert died in October 1232 the Cathedral Chapter elected Burkhard I of Woldenberg as the new archbishop, event though Wilbrand had been expected to take over the position. Less than four years later, on 31 May 1235, Burchard also died, and Wilbrand von Kevernburg was elected to the position of archbishop, although his appointment was not confirmed till November or December 1235. Wilbrand cultivated good relations with the emperor. This meant that relations with the pope, especially after 1239 which was the year in which Pope Gregory excommunicated Emperor Frederick, were dreadful. Wilbrand's loyalty to the emperor provoked several threats of excommunication from a later pope, Innocent IV, who took over in 1241. The wider context in the Magdeburg area was a decline in the authority of the emperor whose focus during these years was on his territories in Sicily. This opened the way for a corresponding growth in the independence and expansionist appetites of local German rulers. As archbishop, Wilbrand found himself in conflict with the territorial ambitions of the Ascanian lords John and his brother Otto, who were jointly the Margraves of Brandenburg, because he transferred the towns of K√∂penick and Mittenwalde from Henry III, Margrave of Meissen. The later outcome of the mid-century wars was the incorporation of these territories into Brandenburg, but Wilbrand was able to win Lebus for the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. In 1253 he acquired land for St Peter's Church in Olvenstedt (today a suburb on the western fringe of Magdeburg).

HMM's capabilities included planning, project development, studies and analysis, design, procurement, and construction engineering and inspection. HMM also provided project, program and construction management as well as facility maintenance and operations. The partnered companies separated in 2016.  History  Hatch Mott MacDonald was founded in 1996 by its parent companies, Hatch Ltd and Mott MacDonald. HMM was intended to take advantage of engineering opportunities in North America. HMM originally provided the bulk of its services in transportation, including the design of tunnels, rail systems, bridges, highways, and airport infrastructure. In 2001, Hatch Mott MacDonald acquired Killam Associates, a New Jersey-based water, wastewater, and environmental services company. HMM has continued to follow a strategy of organic growth coupled with strategic acquisitions. As of 2013, Engineering News-Record ranked HMM number 36 among its \\"Top 500 Design Firms in the United States.\\" Highways and bridges, oil and gas pipelines, rail and transit, tunneling, and water and wastewater services are among the largest contributors to revenue. The Sea-to-Sky Highway Improvement Project is one of HMM's most high-profile projects in the area of highways and bridges. The design-build contractor Peter Kiewit Sons of Kiewit Corporation chose HMM to improve the British Columbia Highway 99, which averaged 574 accidents a year between 1998 and 2004. HMM led 12 design consultants and a team of about 100 people to complete the design of over 65 kilometers of new highway improvements, including 40 bridge structures. The project has reportedly won more than a dozen national and international awards, including Canada's Lieutenant Governor's Award. From 2007 to 2012, HMM provided project management, preliminary design, environmental engineering, permitting, and right-of-way acquisition services for three segments of the California High-Speed Rail system, each with challenging elements. These included to section between Palmdale, California and Los Angeles, which traverses rivers, mountains, densely populated cities, sensitive ecosystems, and three major fault lines. Among HMM's large oil and gas pipeline projects is Spectra Energy's Time III/Temax project, which carries supplies from Rocky Mountain natural gas reserves across Pennsylvania. The pipeline has a capacity of four billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. In September 2011, Pipeline & Gas Journal reported that the project was finished on time and under budget. Tunnels and Tunnelling magazine ranks HMM first among engineering consultants by tunneling revenue in North America. Trenchless Technology magazine ranks HMM number two among design firms in the field of trenchless tunneling technology. HMM played a key role in guiding the alignment of Seattle's Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel (Seattle), directing the tunnel away from the original narrow corridor through the historic Pioneer District. HMM provided engineering services to major water providers, including American Water (company), Aqua America, the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DC Water), New York City Department of Environmental Protection, and Philadelphia Water Department. HMM engineers have promoted an integrated approach to wastewater management, writing in Water Canada that \\"the integration and optimization of stormwater, wastewater, and other source pollution will maximize long-term water quality planning benefits for each dollar spent.\\" In 2015, Hatch and Mott MacDonald announced that HMM would be separated into two distinct businesses. HMM's Canada business became part of Hatch while HMM's US business became part of Mott MacDonald. HMM's Pipelines business, which operated in both Canada and the US, also joined Mott MacDonald. The changes allow Mott MacDonald and Hatch to continue to operate in all sectors throughout North America. Keith Howells and John Bianchini, the CEOs of Mott MacDonald and Hatch, made the following comment: \\"At a time of significant renewal in North American infrastructure, this change allows Hatch and Mott MacDonald and the staff of HMM to build and invest in new ways.\\" Nick DeNichilo, HMM's CEO, continued to lead the HMM business until the company separation concluded. At that point, DeNichilo became President and CEO of Mott MacDonald in North America following the separation of HMM into two distinct businesses. Hatch Infrastructure in North America was led by Michael Schatz, Managing Director of Infrastructure. These arrangements were finalized April 26, 2016.

The eduGAIN service activity that was started in the successor project GN3 (2009-2013), built upon the eduGAIN that was developed in the GN2 project, but was different. On 1 April 2011, eduGAIN became an operational service. In 2012, the eduGAIN service started to reach beyond Europe with the Canadian and Brazilian federations joining the service. In the same year TERENA took up the leadership of the eduGAIN service activity. From April 2013, funding of the service was continued as part of the GN3plus project.  Governance  The eduGAIN Steering Group consists of one representative and one deputy representative of each of the federations participating in the service. The Steering Group approves the profiles and documents in the eduGAIN policy framework and their updates, decides about peering relationships, approves the participation of new federations, decides about the disqualification or temporary suspension of participating federations in case of violation of the policy framework, accepts or amends the plan for audits of eduGAIN operations, appoints the Steering Group chair and non-voting invited observers to the Steering Group, and appoints the Operational Team. Certain decisions of the Steering Group need to be ratified by the eduGAIN Executive Committee, namely changes to the eduGAIN policy framework constitution, the adoption of new technical profiles and other documents in the policy framework that may exclude participating federations from participation in the eduGAIN service, and the approval of major updates to the profiles and documents in the eduGAIN policy framework that are likely to affect any participating federation‚Äôs participation in the eduGAIN service. The role of the eduGAIN Executive Committee has been entrusted to the Executive Board of the GN3plus project (April 2013 - March 2015).

This resulted to a record-breaking mapping updates response enabling over a million map updates in only a week after Haiyan's landfall. The contributed mapping data enabled street-level accurate post-disaster maps on various islands in the Visayas region hit by typhoon Haiyan to OpenStreetMap. On the other hand, raw data from OpenStreetMap has been extracted, compiled and has been produced to various products including paper maps and daily-updated GPS-assisted navigation maps which has helped various international on-field humanitarian agencies such as the International Red Cross, American Red Cross, International Organization for Migration, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, USAID, to operate on relief and rescue operations accurately.

Politics involving aid relief The aid contributions of China and the United States were given focus with regards to their involvement in the politics of the Philippines. Apart from having the two largest economies in the world, both countries are involved in a complex relationship with the island country. China is currently disputing the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea with the Philippines while the United States used to be an occupying power and currently has a mutual defense treaty with the islands. China was initially criticized for its meager contribution of US$100,000 to the typhoon victims, which led to commentary about its disputes with the Philippines. Earlier in 2013, the Philippines sued China over the nine-dotted line. Commentators attribute this low amount to China's intentions to isolate the Philippines while strengthening its ties with the rest of Southeast Asia. The move had mixed reactions from the public of China with some commending its decision while others, such as The Global Times, insisted that China should be a responsible power. China later increased its contributions to US$1.4 million and sent its naval hospital ship Peace Ark for disaster relief.\\" The contributions of the United States was in contrast to that of China. It gave the Philippines an amount of US$20 million worth of aid apart from deploying the United States Marines in order to assist with the humanitarian operations. This was seen by observers as part of the Asia pivot that the United States government had previously announced. The Philippine government had been discussing with the U.S. plans regarding the deployment of U.S. military troops within the country. Aid contributions of the U.S. was seen as a sign of goodwill in order to improve relations.
