History The ‚Äúbalm in Gilead‚Äù is a reference from the Old Testament, but the lyrics of this spiritual refer to the New Testament concept of salvation through Jesus Christ. The Balm of Gilead is interpreted as a spiritual medicine that is able to heal Israel (and sinners in general). In the Old Testament, the balm of Gilead is taken most directly from Jeremiah chapter 8 v. 22: \\"Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for the wounds of my [God's] people?\\" (Another allusion can also be found in Jeremiah chapter 46, v. 2 and 11: ‚ÄúThis is the message (of the Lord) against the army of Pharaoh Neco ‚Ä¶ Go up to Gilead and get balm, O Virgin Daughter of Egypt, but you multiply remedies in vain; here is no healing for you‚Äù - see also Jeremiah chapter 22, v. 6.) The first appearance of the spiritual in something close to its current form is uncertain. A version of the refrain can be found in Washington Glass's 1854 hymn \\"The Sinner's Cure,\\" (see link below) where it is in 7s.6s.7s.6s rather than the Common Meter of today's refrain. Glass attributed this hymn to himself, but like several of the hymns so attributed, it is substantially the work of another. He attached to one of John Newton's Olney hymns of 1779 this refrain: :There is balm in Gilead, :To make the wounded whole; :There's power enough in heaven, :To cure a sin-sick soul. There is no mention of the balm of Gilead in Newton's poem, but it begins: :How lost was my condition :Till Jesus made me whole! :There is but one Physician :Can cure a sin‚Äìsick soul. The similarities in the refrain make it likely that it was written for Newton's verse. The 1973 edition of the 1925 7-shape Primitive Baptist songbook Harp of Ages has an unattributed song \\"Balm in Gilead\\" with a similar chorus, but verses drawn from a Charles Wesley hymn, \\"Father I Stretch My Hands to Thee.\\" The second verse quoted below (\\"If you can't...\\") is also found in some versions of another well-known spiritual \\"(Walk That) Lonesome Valley.\\" \\"Wandering verses,\\" as they are often called, are quite common in the camp meeting and revival context, and were already found in by 1800 in the African-American community, as shown by Richard Allen's 1801 \\"A Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs Selected from Various Authors.\\" In 1845 Edgar Allan Poe mentions it in one of the last stanzas of his poem The Raven: :\\"Prophet!\\" said I, \\"thing of evil! ‚Äì prophet still, if bird or devil! ‚Äî :Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, :Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted ‚Äî :On this home by Horror haunted ‚Äì tell me truly, I implore ‚Äî :\\"Is there ‚Äì is there balm in Gilead? ‚Äì tell me ‚Äì tell me, I implore!\\" :Quoth the Raven \\"Nevermore.\\" Traditional Lyrics Lyrics are as follows: Chorus (in bold): :There is a balm in Gilead :To make the wounded whole; :There is a balm in Gilead :To heal the sin-sick soul. :Some times I feel discouraged, :And think my work‚Äôs in vain, :But then the Holy Spirit :Revives my soul again. (Chorus) :If you cannot sing like angels, :If you can‚Äôt preach like Paul, :You can tell the love of Jesus, :And say He died for all. (Chorus) Alternative Lyrics Lyrics are as follows: Chorus (in bold): :There is a balm in Gilead, :To make the wounded whole; :There is a balm in Gilead, :To heal the sin-sick soul. :Sometimes I feel discouraged, :And think my work‚Äôs in vain, :But then the Holy Spirit :Revives my soul again. (Chorus) :If you cannot preach like Peter, :If you cannot pray like Paul, :You can tell the love of Jesus, :And say He died for all. (Chorus) :Don't ever feel discouraged, :'Cause Jesus is your friend, :And if you lack for knowledge, :He'll not refuse to lend.

Notable buildings in Doddington include Doddington Hall and the Anglican church of St Mary and St Michael, which was built in the 18th century on the site of an original 12th-century place of worship. Wooler Golf Course is also near Doddington.  History and cultural significance  In 1734, the village was described in George Mark's Survey of a Portion of Northumberland as \\"remarkable for its largeness, the badness of its houses and low situation, and perhaps for the greatest quantities of geese of any in its neighbourhood\\". At about the same time, the tune Dorrington, also known as Dorrington Lads, was written down in the William Dixon manuscript.The Master Piper ‚Äì Nine Notes That Shook the World, William Dixon (1733), edited Matt Seattle 1995, Dragonfly Music, ; 3rd edition, edited Matt Seattle 2011, . Having 14 strains, it is the most complex and elaborate of the pieces in that early source for Northumbrian music. The last tune played, on his deathbed, by the celebrated piper Will Allan, who died near Rothbury in 1779, was Dorrington Lads. A rhyme has survived, which fits the second strain of this tune: : Dorrington lads is bonny and Dorrington lads is canny : And I'll hae a Dorrington lad, and ride a Dorrington cuddy. The tune survives in several versions besides that in the William Dixon manuscript; a five-strain version is found both in the Rook manuscript from near Carlisle, and in the Fenwick manuscript, where it is attributed to Robert Reid and ultimately to James Allan and his father Will. This version has much material that also appears in the Dixon version; two rather different versions adapted for Northumbrian smallpipes are found in the Robert Bewick manuscript, and the Lionel Winship manuscript; a further version is found in the manuscript collection of Tom Clough, starting with a variant of Dixon's second strain. In The Denham Tracts, compiled in the mid-19th century, another rhyme about the streets of the village is found: : Southgate and Sandgate and up the Cat Raw, : The Tinkler's Street, and Byegate Ha'! The Tinkler's Street was where itinerant hawkers sold their wares. This association with travellers is not surprising, as Doddington is quite close to Kirk Yetholm, the main base of the Border Gypsies.  Demography  The 2001 UK Census shows a population of 146, with a 50:50 male:female split.  Economy  Besides farming, there was formerly a sandstone quarry in the area, and coal mines. A well-known business currently in Doddington is the Doddington Dairy farm, a producer of organic cheeses and ice creams.

His father was businessman Robert Kindersley, 1st Baron Kindersley GBE. Early years Kindersley was born in Knightsbridge, London, to Robert Molesworth Kindersley, 1st Baron Kindersley, GBE (1871-1954), and Gladys Margaret Beadle. He was educated at Eton College. He married Nancy Farnsworth (daughter of Dr Geoffrey Boyd of Toronto) in October 1921: they had two daughters, Patricia, who married Napier Crookenden, Ginette and a son Robert, who succeeded his father as 3rd Baron Kindersley. Kindersley was managing director of Lazard Brothers, one of the three houses of Lazard, from 1927 to 1964. =War service= Kindersley was commissioned into the Scots Guards in 1917 and served during the First World War. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1918. He rejoined as a lieutenant in the Regular Army Reserve of Officers from 12 November 1938 and at the outbreak of the Second World War he rejoined the Scots Guards. He later commanded a tank battalion of the Scots Guards in the Guards Armoured Division. He completed a parachute training course and qualified as a glider pilot. In May 1943, promoted to acting Brigadier, The Honourable Hugh Kindersley was appointed Commanding officer of the 6th Airlanding Brigade. It was on his recommendation that Major John Howard and D Company 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (the 52nd) were selected to lead the coup de main operation at Pegasus Bridge and Horsa Bridge before the Allied invasion of the Normandy beaches began. Kindersley commanded 6 Airlanding Brigade, part of 6th Airborne Division, during the Normandy landings on D Day, 6 June 1944, landing at 03.30 hours with 6 Airborne divisional headquarters. He was later wounded during the Battle of Br√©ville, and evacuated to England. Brigadier Edwin Flavell replaced him as commanding officer of 6 Airlanding Brigade. Kindersley was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1941 and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1945. Post-war Kindersley was Chairman of Lazard Brothers, one of the three houses of Lazard, from 1953 until 1964 and a director from 1965 to 1971. During his service at Lazard Brothers, he was a director of the Bank of England from March 1947 to March 1967, Chairman of Royal Exchange Assurance from 1955 to 1967, and Chairman of Rolls-Royce Limited from 1956 to 1968. He was one of the figures who, as both a Bank of England director and a financier with private interests, was suspected of having taken advantage of advance warning of a change in Bank Rate to sell gilt-edged securities ahead of the public announcement of the rate change. A judicial inquiry was held to investigate these allegations in 1957, to which he gave evidence. Although subjected to intensive and aggressive questioning by the Solicitor General Reginald Manningham-Buller during the proceedings, he was fully exonerated in Lord Justice Parker's subsequent report in what journalists at the time suspected of a whitewash.David Kynaston, Till Time's Last Stand: A History of The Bank of England, 1694-2013, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017, pp. 434-5 Kindersley was chairman of the Officers Association from 1946 to 1956, Honorary Colonel of 10th Parachute Battalion from 1947 to 1952 and High Sheriff of the County of London in 1951. He succeeded his father as second baron in 1954. He was appointed Commander, Royal Order of St Olav of Norway in 1958.

The songs \\"Stripper\\" and \\"I'm Not Cool\\" were used in seasons one and two of the American television series Gossip Girl, respectively. \\"Stripper\\" was also used in the ITV2 advert for the show's first season. \\"My Vampire\\" was used in the fifth season finale of the American drama series Nip/Tuck. The album's name is a play on \\"Music for the Jilted Generation\\", the second studio album by The Prodigy. Critical reception Ribbed Music for the Numb Generation was well received by music critics. Jenni Cole of musicOMH described the album as \\"dark electro-glam of a lushness not heard since the synthtastic early '80s\\", comparing the band favourably to The Human League, Depeche Mode, Heaven 17 and Soft Cell. Cole added that \\"the music is brilliant. Upbeat, disco-tinged without being cheesy, taking all the best parts from glam and adding them to a Gothy, new century cabaret chic that no doubt translates brilliantly into live performance.\\" Susan Frances of AbsolutePunk commented that the album \\"wraps you in fishnets of cabaret-styled vocals from lead singer Maya Von Doll and techno-dripping rhythms orchestrated by drummer Paul Stone and bassist Matt Lord. The barbed guitar riffs of Toni Sailor are perched in thickets of bristling keyboards from Weston Doll creating movements that expand and separate with a will of their own, alternating lean segments with thick froths while covered in Maya's femininely sweet vocal reams.\\" She added that the music is \\"both street savvy and club chic, keeping away from falling into a mundane routine that often plagues synth-pop albums.\\" Chris Reynolds of Gigwise viewed Sohodolls as \\"a sleazy yet chic outfit comparable to Goldfrapp\\" and wrote that \\"Maya's vocals are seductive and the bass and synths are as smooth as can be\\", but felt that \\"the lack of variation ... detracts greatest from a fine debut. When stripped down this is simple pop music with an eighties edge and can become tiresome at points such as the lacklustre 'Trash the Rental'.\\" Emily Kate Stephens of MyVillage concluded, \\"With a huge mix of influences Sohodolls travel through this album with a strength and grace that means you can't help but listen. They can look forwarded to awakening their followers' senses.

A left-back, Switzer played for Darlington, Hyde United, Salford City, Irlam and AFC Monton before his retirement in 2013. Career Born in Salford, Greater Manchester, Switzer began his career as a youth player at Manchester United, having joined the club in 1982 after being spotted playing for the local Barrhill Lads Club when he was only eight years old. Switzer was part of the United youth team that won the FA Youth Cup in 1992, playing with future United stars such as Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Paul Scholes. Following on from this success, Switzer was offered a professional contract with the Red Devils; however, unlike his team-mates, who received multi-year deals, Switzer was only offered one year. Switzer was released at the end of the 1992‚Äì93 season. Switzer then signed for Darlington on a free transfer in July 1993. However, Switzer only played for the Quakers for one season, failing to hold down a regular place, before being given another free transfer in the summer of 1994. He then signed for Hyde United in the Northern Premier League, and played for them for six years from 1994 to 2000, making over 200 appearances for the East Manchester team. Since then, Switzer has played for Salford City, but left his home-town club in 2006 to sign for Irlam. After a short time there, he signed for AFC Monton.

He has been a member of the Magic City Jazz Orchestra, Cleveland Eaton and the Alabama All-Stars, the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame All-Stars, and Ray Reach and Friends. He was a 1988 inductee into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. Early years John T. \\"Fess\\" Whatley trained Stewart, Erskine Hawkins, Dud Bascomb, Paul Bascomb, and Sun Ra (previously known as Herman Blount). Whatley taught music at Industrial High in Birmingham, which at the time was one of the largest populated high schools in America, with more than 3,500 students walking its hallways. Alvin \\"Stumpy\\" Robinson, the band director at Washington Jr High School, was also influential in Stewart's development. Tommy Stewart enrolled at Alabama State College without knowing how he was going to pay tuition. The problem solved itself when he joined the Bama State Collegians, a dance band formed in 1929 who at various times featured Erskine Hawkins, Avery Parrish, Joe Newman, Sam Taylor, Julian Dash, Benny Powell, and Vernall Fournier. Other musicians who attended Alabama State are Clarence Carter, Fred Wesley (James Brown), and Walter Orange (Commodores). The popular band made enough money to fund Stewart's way through four years of college. Education He attended Alabama State University, where he directed the Bama State Collegians (formerly directed by trumpeter Erskine Hawkins). Later, he studied jazz arranging at the Eastman School of Music. Stewart also studied arranging under John Duncan, a classical composer and teacher at Alabama State University. Tommy pledged Omega Psi Phi at the Gamma Sigma Chapter located on the Alabama State University Campus. Teaching years He taught high school from 1961 to 1963 at Fayette High School in St. Clair County Alabama. In 1969 he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and taught in Fayetteville, Ga; he also worked for Morris Brown College doing band arrangements. He taught jazz and did band arrangements at Morehouse College from 1974 to 1985. He also taught band classes at West End High School in Birmingham, Alabama from 1991-2001. He also taught \\"A Survey of Popular Music\\" at Georgia State University in 1979. From 2005 to 2007, Tommy served as a faculty member of the educational program at the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, under Director of Student Jazz Programs, Ray Reach. In this position, he was also a member of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame All-Stars. Music career In 1956 he played with Roy Hamilton. In 1963 Stewart performed with Willie Hightower L.C. Cook, and Junior Parker during summer vacations. He arranged music for Eula Cooper, The Mighty Hannibal, Sandy Gaye, and Langston-French Duo (Langston is an ex-Pip and Gladys Knight's cousin). Most of these arranging assignments took place on Jessie Jones's label, Tragar Records. During the 1970s, he worked at the Gold Lounge accompanying Gladys Knight & the Pips and The Tams. In 1971 he went on the road with Johnnie Taylor's show, which included Jackie Moore, King Floyd, Z. Z. Hill, and The Stylistics, who were popular because of the song \\"You're a Big Girl Now.\\" He was the chief arranger for a television show in 1972 called Nightlife South which ran for 25 weeks. In 1973 he wrote charts for The Burning of Atlanta album by The Spirit of Atlanta for Buddah Records. Working for GRC/Aware Records, he arranged songs for John Edwards (who later joined The Spinners) and Loletta Holloway. Stewart toured as musical director with Johnnie Taylor on his Disco Lady Tour in 1976 and also served as Ted Taylor's musical director. In 1973 he directed Taylor's band while they performed on The Midnight Special with host Wolfman Jack. In the late 1970s Stewart collaborated with Marlon McNichols, a producer from Detroit, Michigan, to record disco with Final Approach, Cream De CoCo, Tamiko Jones, Moses Davis, and Stewart's album, which included the song \\"Bump & Hustle Music\\". Stewart arranged for Luther Ingram in 1977 and Johnny Baylor (Ingram was manager and owner of KoKo Records). He released his debut album, Tommy Stewart for Abraxas in 1976. Rick Anderson at AllMusic said about the album, \\"It's almost impossible to keep a straight face while listening to this album...It's a document of one of pop music's most simultaneously embarrassing and glorious periods‚Äîthe High Disco Era‚Äîwhen all pretense of lyrical sophistication was abandoned in favor of occasional interjections of 'Hey! Get down! Get off your seats and jam!' (a direct quote from this album)\\". Stewart produced Martha High's solo album for Salsoul and co-wrote most of the songs. It was around this time that he produced Ripple, a band who recorded the song \\"The Beat Goes On,\\" and Southside Coalition, made up of some of Stewart's former students from Archer High School in Atlanta. He worked with Major Lance on two albums, toured with the Tams in 1983, and did arrangements for Serena Johnson's album The Lack of Communication. In 1990, he co-founded the African American Philharmonic Orchestra with founder and conductor John Peek. He moved from Atlanta to Birmingham in 1992.

Design The H-3 was a two seat general purpose helicopter. It has a duraluminium tube superstructure, an open cockpit and an undergear of metal skids. The design is typical of ultra-light helicopters of the period, being powered by tip-jets. Two ramjets, one at the tip of each rotor blade, power the helicopter. The small tail rotor is powered by the motion of the main rotor. The ramjets could run at any given fuel, which gave the helicopter a certain versatility. The Kromhout designed and built ramjets generated thrust and made a complex gear box unnecessary. Later, Aviolanda-built ramjets generated thrust. In order to start the ramjets, a small auxiliary power unit span the main rotor to 70 rpm, when the ramjets could be ignited. Variants with ski‚Äôs, floating devices and medical evacuation stretchers were developed and tested, but these versions were never produced. A version as crop duster was developed, and in due time, the H-3 was mainly marketed as crop dusting helicopter. Production The H-3 was assembled at Aviolanda. Subassembly took place at Aviolanda which built the fuselage and at Kromhout which built the engines. Fokker, a subcontractor to NHI, built the rotorblades. Final assembly took place at the newly opened Rotterdam Airport. The initial production run counted ten helicopters of which the first three were used for development, testing and airworthiness tests. The second production run of ten helicopters was to be undertaken by Aviolanda after Kromhout left the joint venture. This second production run was to be equipped with an uprated ramjet. It is unsure whether the improved ramjet was ever produced. Commercial failure The seventh Kolibrie (manufacturers number 3007) on display at the Aviodrome museum at Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam, in 1967. Actually registered PH-NGV, it wears 'PH-NHI' markings. Although the H-3 was considered to be technical success, it never was a commercial success. Despite its low acquisition price, the project became a failure. Several factors contributed to this failure. Firstly, the Hiller OH-23 Raven was provided to the Royal Netherlands Air Force by the United States free of charge, under the Mutual Defense Assistance Pact (MDAP). Secondly, NHI's two most important designers, Jan M. Drees and Gerard F. Verhage, left the company, which never recovered. Thirdly, the ramjets, at the tips of the rotor blades, required a great deal of development to make them acceptable for production, with potential buyers regarding the ramjets as unsafe. Fourthly, the extraordinary fuel consumption of the two ramjets made the helicopter uneconomical to operate, flight time and flight range were quite limited making the helicopter unattractive for commercial or military use. Lastly, the ramjets were incredibly loud: during testing, complaints were filed by people living over 5 kilometers away from the test site. Production list Overall, nine H-3‚Äôs were built between 1958 and 1959 by NHI at Rotterdam Airport when Kromhout was still a parent company. After Kromhout left, Aviolanda built another two H-3‚Äôs at their Papendrecht plant. The few production models were mainly exported to Israel, Germany, the UK and Netherlands New Guinea. A few models stayed in the Netherlands. Survivors The remaining examples that are known of are to be found at the aerospace museum Aviodrome. Aviodrome has one SOBEH H-2 and one H-3 on display. A derelict survives in Israel.

Greater China It is the Chinese tradition to record family members in a book, including every male born in the family, who they are married to, etc. Traditionally, only males' names are recorded in the books. During the Cultural revolution, many of the books were destroyed, because they were considered by the Chinese communist party as among the Four Olds to be eschewed. Therefore much valuable cultural history was destroyed forever. In Taiwan, Hong Kong, and areas untouched by the revolution, many Chinese people still kept their genealogy books, some of which are thousands of years old. According to Guinness World Record, the oldest genealogy book is that of the Confucius family. India In India, the Hindu genealogy registers at Haridwar have been a subject of study for many years and have been microfilmed by Genealogical Society of Utah (GSU) USA.India Genealogical Society of Utah. In India, Michael Lobo has been involved in documenting and compiling the history and genealogy of families belonging to the Mangalorean Catholic community since 1993, under a research project entitled \\"A Genealogical Encyclopaedia of Mangalorean Catholic Families\\". As of 2009, his work covers over a thousand families and is being continually updated with names and records of new families. Lobo claims that the Mangalorean Catholic community has the distinction of being the only community in the world to possess its own genealogical encyclopaedia. Ireland Genealogy has been a fundamental part of Irish culture since prehistory. Of the many surviving manuscripts, a large number are devoted to genealogy, either for a single family, or many. It was practised in both Gaelic and Anglo-Norman Ireland. A number of the more notable books include: * Leabhar na nGenealach (The Great Book of Irish Genealogies) * The √ì Cl√©irigh Book of Genealogies * The Book of the Burkes * Leabhar Adhamh √ì Cian√°in * An Leabhar Muimhneach * Leabhar Donn Families who were professional historians included Clan √ì Duibhgeann√°in, √ì Cl√©irigh, Clan MacFhirbhisigh, √ì Maolconaire. Korea In Korea the genealogy book is called jokbo or chokbo. Each family has a jokbo which is passed down through generations, and copies are often printed and distributed among family members as necessary. The firstborn son of each family (in a form of primogeniture) inherits the original jokbo (as opposed to the copies) and continues the genealogy and family line. It was often used in pre-modern (i.e., post-Joseon period) Korea as proof of being of the yangban class. While many clans still maintain a jokbo, its function (which was very important, heavily relied upon, and legally binding before the modern era) is largely relegated to clan record-keeping and other minor (i.e., not legally binding) social roles.

Around 82,000 M2s were produced between 1957 and 1968. Around 1500 M2s were produced by Ernst Leitz Canada, but most of these are not marked as such on the top plate. Comparisons The M2 was considered to be a more affordable, simplified version of the 1954 Leica M3. Notably, the frame counter of the M2 was composed of a disk plate beneath the film advance lever that had to be manually reset to zero after reloading. This system was close to that of the Leica III series, and unlike that of the M3, which is an independent frame counter, visible through a window in the top plate, that automatically resets to zero when the film take-up spool is removed. The rangefinder system was also simplified from that of the M3 and this made it potentially more prone to rangefinder flare. The M2 has a rangefinder with a 0.72 magnification and framelines for 35, 50 and 90mm lenses instead of the 0.91 magnification and 50, 90 and 135mm framelines of the M3. This made it better suited for photojournalists who favour shorter lenses or for spectacle- wearers using a 50mm lens who sometimes find it difficult to see the framelines on the M3. The ground glass frameline illumination window of the M3 was replaced with a fresnel-type plastic lens. Finally, the ornate beveling around the various windows on the front of the M3 were flattened on the body of the M2. Unlike the M3, the widest framelines were not always visible so only one set of framelines were ever displayed at one time. All M2s are single stroke advance. The M2 was followed by the still simpler Leica M1 and then the Leica M4, which used a similar rangefinder design but re-introduced the M3 style frame counter and added a faster loading system and a canted rewind lever. On the present-day used market the M2, originally intended to be more \\"affordable\\", sells at prices only slightly lower than the M3. Both cameras are made to a similar level of quality, and the M2's framelines have proved to be more versatile over time, with all subsequent Leica rangefinder models having 35mm framelines included.  Variations  There are a number of variations of the Leica M2. Although most models have the self-timer lever, it is absent from some earlier models. Also, some early models have a film rewind push-button instead of the typical lever. About 2400 M2s were factory-painted black, but these are relatively rare and more valued by collectors. Near the end of production, Leica also produced a number of M2-R models, which had the faster loading system of the later Leica M4.

A promising architect, he revised many older treatises on architecture from 1097 to 1100. By 1100, he had completed his own architectural work, which he presented to Emperor Zhezong of Song. The emperor's successor, Emperor Huizong of Song, had the book published in 1103 in order to provide a unified set of architectural standards for builders, architects, and literate craftsmen as well as for the engineering agencies of the central government. With his book becoming a noted success, Li Jie was promoted by Huizong as the Director of Palace Buildings. Thereafter, Li became well known for his oversight in the construction of administrative offices, palace apartments, gates and gate-towers, the ancestral temple of the Song Dynasty, along with numerous Buddhist temples. In 1145, a second edition of Li's book was published by Wang Huan. Between 1222-1233, a third printing was published. This edition, published in Pingjiang (now Suzhou), was later handcopied into the Yongle Encyclopedia and Siku Quanshu. In addition, a number of handcopied editions were made for private libraries. One of these handcopies of the Pingjiang edition was rediscovered in 1919 and printed as facsimile in 1920. The treatise Tenon and mortice work of tie beams and cross beams, Yingzao Fashi Some of Li's book used material from preexisting architectural writings, but most of it is documentation of the inherited traditions of craftsmen and architects passed down by word of mouth. Li's book provides a glossary of technical terms that includes mathematical formulae. He incorporated topography in his estimations for buildings on various types of sites. He also estimated the monetary costs of hiring laborers of different skill levels and types of expertise in crafts. His estimates take a day's work as their basis and include the materials needed, taking into account the season in which the work was done. Li's work incorporates building rules and regulations, accounting information, standards for materials used in construction, and the classification of various crafts. The 34 chapters in the book specify in detail the units of measurement, the construction of moats and fortifications, and standards for stonework as well as for greater and lesser woodwork. It includes the specifications (and illustrations) for constructing bracketing units with inclined arms and joints for columns and beams, as well as directions for wood carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, and the formulas for decorative paints, glazes and various coatings. Included are the mixing proportions for mortars in masonry, brickwork and glazed tile. The book provides hand-drawn illustrations of all the practices and standards. He outlined structural carpentry in great detail, providing standard dimensional measurements for all the components. For instance, Li developed a standard 8-rank grading system for different sizes of timber elements. The system was known as the cai-fen system of units and could be universally applied to buildings. Although others were written and compiled beforehand, Li's book is the oldest existing technical manual on Chinese architecture to have survived intact and in its entirety.

According to the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission, \\"serving Gahwah (Coffee) in Saudi Arabia is a sign of hospitality and generosity\\". Traditionally, the coffee beans were roasted, cooled and ground in front of the guests using a mortar and pestle. The host would then add cardamom pods to the coffee beans during the grinding process. Once the coffee was brewed, it would be poured for the guests. Today, though, Gahwah is not prepared in front of the guests; instead it is elegantly served in a Dallah and poured into small cups called Finjan. Yoghurt is normally made into a drink called Laban Sobia is a cold drink usually made in the Hijaz but now available all over Saudi Arabia especially during Ramadan. It's made from a light fermented mixture of Barley/Brown bread, Date palm sap, Herbs and Spices. It may be either white or colored depending on the flavor. It's also found to have health benefits.  Islamic dietary laws  Islamic dietary laws forbid the eating of pork and the drinking of alcoholic beverages. This law is enforced throughout Saudi Arabia. According to Islamic law, animals must be butchered in a halal way and blessed before they can be eaten. According to the Saudi Arabian cultural mission, \\"guests are served hot coffee and dates as a symbol of generosity and hospitality. The same practice is carried out in the month of Ramadan. Muslims in Saudi Arabia break their fast with dates, water and Arabian coffee. The caffeine in the coffee and the carbohydrates and iron in dates nourishes the fasting person with a lot of energy. This helps them perform the Tarawih held in the evenings during Ramadan.\\"  See also  * Arab cuisine  References   Further reading  * Davies, Catriona. \\"Saudi foodies ditch fast food for fine dining.\\" CNN.

Binn idir an d√° Log is the tallest mountain in the range. Naming Binn idir an d√° Log derives its name from the two glacial corries that bound each end of its high rocky summit ridge (the north-western corrie is a lake). Binn idir an d√° Log is sometimes incorrectly named as \\"Barrslievenaroy\\" (or \\"Baurslievenaroy\\") (; the mountain fort), which is a small townland on the northern slopes of the mountain that is marked in some Ordnance Survey Ireland maps. The Placenames Database of Ireland records an anglicised version as \\"Benadolug\\", however, this does not appear in other noted Irish mountain placename reference guides. Geography Binn idir an d√° Log lies at the centre of the long north-west to south-east central spine of the Maumturks range in the Connemara National Park. The mountain has a high winding rocky summit ridge, littered in quartzite rocks and gravel, that includes the subsidiary peak of Binn idir an d√° Log SE Top at . To the southeast of the summit ridge is a large corrie (and the townland of Barrslievenaroy below), and then the 4th highest Maumturk of Binn Chaonaigh at . To the northwest of the summit ridge is an even larger corrie lake (at L 879536), with steep cliffs on its backwall, which then rises up again to the summit of Knocknahillion at . The col between Binn idir an d√° Log and Knocknahillion is the pass of Maumahoge (, and the corrie lake is called Lough Maumahoge (). Binn idir an d√° Log's prominence of qualifies it as a P600, and a Marilyn, and it also ranks it as the 52nd-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the minimum prominence threshold is 100 metres. Hill walking The easiest way summit Binn idir an d√° Log is a 6-kilometre 3-hour route via the pass of Maumahoge; however, because of its positioning on the high rocky central spine of the central Maumturk range, it is also summited in a longer 13-kilometre 5-6 hour loop-route starting at the col of Maumeen , in the south, climbing Binn Chaonaigh and then onto the top of Binn idir an d√° Log, before descending via Maumahoge, and walking back. Binn idir an d√° Log is also climbed as part of the Maamturks Challenge, a 25-kilometre 10‚Äì12 hour walk over the full Maumturks range (from Maam Cross to Leenaun), which is considered one of the \\"great classic ridge-walks of Ireland\\", but of \\"extreme grade\\" due to the circa 7,600 feet of total ascent. Since 1975, the University College Galway Mountaineering Club, has run the annual \\"Maamturks Challenge Walk\\" (MCW), and man two checkpoints on Binn idir an d√° Log; one at the summit (the summit marks 54% of MCW climbing completed), and another at Lough Maumahoge (the Lough marks 63% of MCW climbing, and 51% of MCW distance, completed), which has a 2pm cut-off time for participants. Rock climbing While the Maumturks range is not particularly known for rock climbing routes (unlike Bencorr and its Carrot Ridge spur, across the Inagh Valley), some have been developed at a crag just below and west of Lough Maumahoge (L876 532), with routes of 90 to 190 metres at climbing grades of S to HVS.

Owned by the Royal Broadcasting Company, it broadcast from studios at 103 South Catawba Street in Lancaster. In July 1964, a sister FM station joined it when WLCM-FM 107.1 (later WPAJ) signed on (it is now WRHM). In 1987, WLCM and WPAJ were purchased by Our Three Sons Broadcasting, owners of WRHI AM in nearby Rock Hill, South Carolina. The new owners moved the FM to Rock Hill and sold WLCM to a broadcast group headed by former WBT announcer Bill Curry. Following the removal of its FM signal, the station was not profitable and ceased operations in 1992. The station's tower still exists and is a landmark in the town of Lancaster. After, the protection contours for WLCM were removed, several stations improved their service areas by either changing frequencies (WADE moved from 1210 to 1340, adding nighttime service) or moving transmitter locations and increasing power (WGIV on 1370 moved from Gastonia to Pineville, and broadcasts with 19,000 watts daytime).

Plov (pilaf) (, ), also called osh (), is the national dish in Tajikistan, as in other countries in the region. Green tea is the national drink. Common foods and dishes Eating qurutob the traditional way: with one's hands Palav or osh, generically known as plov (pilaf), is a rice dish made with shredded yellow turnip or carrot, and pieces of meat, all fried together in vegetable oil or mutton fat in a special qazan (a wok-shaped cauldron) over an open flame. The meat is cubed, the carrots are chopped finely into long strips, and the rice is colored yellow or orange by the frying carrots and the oil. The dish is eaten communally from a single large plate placed at the center of the table, often in with one's hands in the traditional way. Another traditional dish that is still eaten with hands from a communal plate is qurutob (), whose name describes the preparation method: qurut (, dried balls of salty cheese) is dissolved in water (, ob) and the liquid is poured over strips of –∞ thin flaky flatbread (patyr or fatir, , or more accurately —Ñ–∞—Ç–∏—Ä —Ä–∞–≤“ì–∞–Ω”£, fatir ravghani, i.e., fatir made with butter or tallow for flakiness). Before serving the dish is topped with onions fried in oil until golden and other fried vegetables. No meat is added. Qurutob is considered the national dish. A selection of traditional non at the market. A Tajik man makes plov. Meals are almost always served with non (), flatbread found throughout Central Asia. If a Tajik has food but not non, he will say he is out of food. If non is dropped on the ground, people will put it up on a high ledge for beggars or birds. Legend holds that one is not supposed to put non upside down because this will bring bad luck. The same holds true if anything is put on top of the non, unless it is another piece of non. Traditional Tajik soups include mainly meat and vegetable soups (such as shurbo and piti), and meat soups with noodles (such as laghmon and ugro). Other dishes shared regionally, either as fast food or as an appetizer, include manti (steamed meat dumplings), tushbera (pelmeni), sambusa (a triangular pastry with either a meat and onion stuffing or a pumpkin and onion stuffing, baked in a tandoor oven), and belyash (pl. belyashi, , deep-fried cakes made of yeast dough and filled with minced meat, similar to pirozhki). Soviet cuisine both influenced and was in turn influenced by Tajik cuisine. =Dairy products= Dairy dishes, usually served as part of the spread of appetizers in a Tajik meal and scooped with pieces of flatbread, include chaka (a sour milk preparation), thick yogurt, and kaymak (high-fat clotted cream). Qurut balls may be served as a snack or an accompaniment to cold beverages. Although not a traditional Tajik drink, kefir, a drinking yogurt, is often served with breakfast. =Summer produce= In the summer, Tajikistan abounds in produce and fruit; its grapes and melons were famous throughout the former Soviet Union. The bazaar also sell pomegranates, apricots, plums, peaches, apples, pears, figs, and persimmons. Beverages Tea generally accompanies every meal and is frequently offered between meals as a gesture of hospitality to guests and visitors. It is served hot in a china pot with a lid, and is drunk with sugar from small saucer-less cups without handles (piola).

He was released after more than 14 years in prison on 1 December 2012.https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h4-kVr36GfWQf- SiQJc3_YbkY2cQ?docId=CNG.e005752de618c89324b5cd4777c3b725.441  Background  Wan had a tough childhood, growing up in the slums of Macau and fighting for his life on the streets before rising through the ranks of the 14K. His rise was accelerated by the arrival of another gangster, Ng Wai, whom he began to work for. As Wan's position in the 14K got higher, Wai asked him to 'eliminate' his boss, Mo-Ding Ping, an assignment which Wan accepted. This provoked a year-long turf war, finally coming to a close when Ping had to flee Macau to avoid a murder charge.  Gang war with former associate  However, tension between the two gangsters grew as Wai grew wary of Wan's high-profile persona. Teaming up with rival triad group the Shui Fong, a vicious turf war broke out in 1996 and 1997. In early 1997, an unsigned letter was sent to several newspapers in the area. It said: \\"Warning: From this day on it is forbidden to mention Broken Tooth Koi in the press; otherwise bullets will have no eyes, and knives and bullets will have no feelings.\\" In 1997 Wan briefly fled Macau to avoid two arrest warrants, one from a new anti-triad law enacted in Macau, and one for drug-trafficking from China. However, in August a Portuguese judge cleared Wan of all charges, and unexpectedly retired and moved back to Portugal the very next day. Wan then proceeded to attack Wai in public, putting up posters claiming he was a drug trafficker and declaring that anyone visiting Wai's casinos would become his enemy. Ultimately, Wan amassed enough power and influence and took over Wai's rackets completely. By this time he was earning $6 million a month from his legal gambling establishments.  Involvement in the film industry and arrest  In the autumn of 1997, Wan approached Hong Kong movie producer Henry Fong Ping to produce a film based on his life. The result was the 1998 movie Casino (aka Ho Kong Fung Wan) starring Simon Yam as Giant, a triad boss living the high life in the Macau underworld. Wan agreed to extensive research meetings to make the film as accurate as possible, as well as using his influence on Macau to help the crew film. One of his most outrageous stunts was to close down the Macau- Taipa Bridge for some hours to allow filming of a crucial scene in the movie. The producers had asked the Macau Government for permission to film on the bridge, closing it to traffic, but permission was denied. However, Wan wanted the scene to be shot anyway so he closed traffic from both sides of the bridge without any warning and the scene was filmed in this manner. Traffic to and from Macau was, because of this, halted for around two hours. No police intervention was made or any other measures by the Macau Government were taken to reopen the bridge to normal traffic flow on what was then one of the two links between Macau mainland and Taipa-Coloane. A week before opening night, as he watched his own movie Casino, Wan was arrested and charged with illegal gambling, loan-sharking, criminal association, and attempted murder of chief of police Antonio Marques Baptista with a car bomb. In November 1999, in a landmark trial, he was convicted and jailed, along with eight associates including his brother Wan Kuok-hung. Wan was sentenced to 15 years in prison. All assets of the nine were confiscated.'Broken Tooth' goes to jail, BBC News, 23 November 1999 His jail term was later reduced to 13 years and 10 months.

Prior to his prison sentence he went through three marriages and has fathered six children. As a result of his gangster lifestyle he has also acquired a number of wounds. He has been shot twice and has had his arms badly mangled by meat cleavers, and as a result cannot straighten his two middle fingers.

(1976). Historical and geographical dictionary of Japan During the Edo period, it was the headquarters of a junior branch of the Sakai clan, who were hereditary daimy≈ç of Obama Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. The castle was also known by the name of .  History  Following the Battle of Sekigahara in 1601, the victorious Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded Wakasa Province to his general, Ky≈çgoku Takatsugu. At first, Takatsugu moved into Nochiseyama Castle, the ancestral seat of the Takeda clan, which was built on a mountain overlooking the city of Obama. However, he quickly decided to build a new castle on a river delta in Obama Bay, which would give him greater control of the j≈çkamachi and the strategic port. Construction was continued by his son Ky≈çgoku Tadataka from 1609; however, Tadataka was transferred to Izumo Province in 1634, before the castle was completed. The Ky≈çgoku clan was replaced by Sakai Tadakatsu, an important retainer of the shogunate, who had served as Tair≈ç under sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu and Tokugawa Ietsuna. He modified the layout of the castle and completed it in 1641. The Sakai clan continued to rule from Obama Castle for fourteen generations over 237 years to the end of the Edo period. Most of the castle was destroyed by a fire in 1871 during the construction of an Imperial Japanese Army barracks, and although the donjon survived, it was scrapped in 1875. Much of the second bailey is now occupied by residential housing, and only a portion of the moats, strong ramparts and foundation of the donjon survive. A Shinto shrine, the Obama Jinja is now located near the site of the donjon. In 1956, the site of Obama Castle was designated a prefectural historic site. Layout Layout of Obama Castle Obama Castle was built on the shores of the Sea of Japan, on a needle- like peninsula formed by two rivers which contribute greatly to its natural defences. At the southwestern edge of the inner bailey was a 29-meter three- story donjon modelled after the Fujimi Yagura at Edo Castle.. The inner bailey was projected by a concentric outer bailey with 30 yagura watchtowers and by water moats.

First National City Bank's (now Citibank) abuses under his leadership brought an end to ownership of investment affiliates by commercial banks. Early life and education Mitchell was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, where his father, George E. Mitchell, worked for a produce dealer and served as mayor from 1887 until 1888. Mitchell graduated from Amherst College in 1899, after which he got a job with the Western Electric Company in Chicago. Career In 1903, he became assistant to its president. After three years, he left the firm and moved to New York City, where he became assistant to the president of The Trust Company of America. Between 1911 and 1916, he ran his own investment house, C. E. Mitchell & Company. In 1916, he became vice-president of National City Company, which he reorganized into a private investment banking firm. Shortly after, he relocated to Tuxedo Park, New York. Nicknamed \\"Sunshine Charley\\", Mitchell was elected president of National City Bank (now Citibank) in 1921 and, in 1929, was appointed chairman. Also in 1921, he was elected president of National City Company, which became the largest security-issuing entity in the world. Under his leadership, the bank expanded rapidly and, by 1930, had 100 branches in 23 countries outside the United States. His salesmen sold millions of shares in the bank totaling $650 million, much of which would be lost in the Crash of 1929. Indeed, while the Federal Reserve Bank was attempting to curb speculation earlier in 1929, Mitchell flaunted a $25 million advance to traders. Arrest and acquittal Mitchell remained chairman until 1933, when he was arrested and indicted for tax evasion by then Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Dewey. Charges were brought following testimony by Mitchell in which he openly stated that he had sold his stake in National City Bank to avoid paying taxes.Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders, John N. Ingham, Greenwood Press, 1983.The Great Crash 1929, John Kenneth Galbraith, Houghton Mifflin, 1954. Defended by attorney Max Steuer, he was found not guilty of all criminal charges, but the government won a million-dollar civil settlement against him. In 1933, the U.S. Senate's Pecora Commission investigated Mitchell as its first witness for his part in tens of millions of dollars in losses, excessive pay, and tax avoidance. In November 1929, U.S. Senator Carter Glass said, \\"Mitchell more than any 50 men is responsible for this stock crash.\\"\\"Damnation of Mitchell\\". Time. March 6, 1933.

Plov (pilaf) is the staple, everyday food, which is also served at celebrations. It consists of chunks of mutton, carrots and rice fried in a large cast-iron cauldron similar to a Dutch oven. Manti are dumplings filled with ground meat, onions or pumpkin. Shurpa is a meat and vegetable soup. A wide variety of filled pies and fried dumplings are available in restaurants and bazaars, including somsa, gutap (often filled with spinach), and ishlykly. These are popular with travelers and taxi drivers, as they can be eaten quickly on the run, and are often sold at roadside stands. Turkmen cuisine does not generally use spices or seasonings, and is cooked with large amounts of cottonseed oil for flavor. Chegdermeh, a mixture of rice, meat, tomato and onions, is a uniquely Turkmen dish. Shashlyk, skewered chunks of mutton, lamb, chicken, or sometimes fish, grilled over charcoal and garnished with raw sliced onion and a special vinegar-based sauce, is served in restaurants and often sold in the street. Restaurants in Turkmenistan serve mainly Russian fare such as pelmeni, buckwheat (grechka), golubtsy, and a wide variety of mayonnaise-based salads. Lagman, an Uyghur noodle dish, can also be found in some areas. Melons Melon vendor from Samarkand, Russian Turkestan (picture taken around 1905 to 1915) In the culinary arena, Turkmenistan is perhaps most famous for its melons, especially in the former Soviet Union, where it was once the major supplier.

Retrieved April 15, 2008 they are a great source of national pride in Turkmenistan and subject of their own Melon Day holiday. Turkmen sources claim the country is home to up to 400 distinct varieties. Bread Meals are almost always served with naan, Central Asian flat bread, known locally as √ß√∂rek. Turkmen bread is prepared differently from other breads in the region in thick, round disc-shaped loaves baked in a traditional tamdyr clay oven. Bread has a high symbolic importance in Turkmen culture,Sacred Words \\"Tamdyr\\" and \\"Chorek\\" Paseviev, Ikar. Retrieved April 15, 2008 and it is considered highly impolite to turn a loaf of bread upside down or to mistreat bread in any way. There are many superstitions based around bread and its preparation. Bread baked with meat inside (etli √ß√∂rek, or \\"meat bread\\") can be consumed as a meal in itself. √ùagly √ß√∂rek (literally \\"oily bread\\") is a flaky, layered type of flat bread made with butter. Beverages As in the rest of Central Asia, green tea is the primary drink, consumed at all hours. In the Turkmen language, \\"chai\\" (tea) can refer to eating a meal or sitting down for a visit. In the Dashoguz region, it is sometimes drunk \\"Kazakh-style\\" with milk, often to disguise the salty taste of the drinking water in that area. Gatyk, a thick drinking yogurt similar to kefir, is often served with breakfast and sometimes used as a condiment on b√∂rek or manti, replacing the traditional sour cream. The drink the nation is known for, however, is chal, a fermented camel's milk, which is a white sparkling beverage that has a sour flavour and is popular in Central Asia, particularly in Turkmenistan.Anatoly Khazanov, Nomads and the outside world, Second edition, University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, p. 49 Because of specific preparation requirements and it being extremely perishable, chal presents a great challenge for importers to ship outside Turkmenistan or the region for foreign consumption.Great Culinary Dictionary. \\"Chal\\" in Russian, retrieved April 11, 2007 It is similar to the Kyrgyz drink shoro.

She was first named after James Screven, an American general during the American Revolutionary War. She was renamed and commissioned after Shaula, the second-brightest star system in the constellation of Scorpius. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction James Screven was laid down on 4 October 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1213, by the St. Johns River Shipbuilding Company, Jacksonville, Florida; she was sponsored by Mrs. Gardner T. Gillette, a direct descendant of the namesake, and launched on 23 November 1943. She was acquired by the US Navy, under a bareboat charter on 4 December 1943, and renamed Shaula. She was converted for naval service by the Gibbs Gas Engine Co., Jacksonville, and commissioned in Jacksonville, on 5 May 1944, Lieutenant Commander Edward B. Waters, USNR, in command. Service history On 17 May, Shaula departed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, on her shakedown cruise. On 1 June, she was attached to the Naval Transportation Service and, two days later, sailed for Davisville, Rhode Island, where she loaded cargo. In mid-June, she was underway for Pearl Harbor, via New York City, Guant√°namo Bay, and the Panama Canal Zone. Shaula arrived at Pearl Harbor on 13 July; discharged her cargo; and sailed for Naval Supply Depot (NSD), Oakland, California, on 3 August. There, she was converted to a fleet issue ship for dry provisions, loaded with cargo, and ordered to return to Pearl Harbor. Upon arriving there on the 30th, she was rerouted to Seeadler Harbor, Manus. From 20 September to 16 October, she discharged cargo to U.S. 3rd Fleet units and, when empty, sailed for San Pedro, California, to reload. Shaula stood out of San Pedro on 23 November 1944. She called at Pearl Harbor, and continued to Eniwetok, where she provisioned fleet units from 15 to 25 December 1944, when she moved to Ulithi. She remained there until 12 February 1945, when she sailed in convoy for Guam. Eight days later, she sailed for San Francisco. After completing voyage repairs and reloading, she headed west, on 3 April, for Ulithi and Leyte Gulf. The cargo ship remained in Leyte Gulf from 25 May to 2 October, when she sailed for Wakayama, Japan, via Okinawa. Shaula departed Wakayama, three weeks later for Bungo Suido, to provision minesweepers; thence to Hire Wan, Nagasaki, and Sasebo. =Typhoon Nora= On 19 November 1945, she was underway from Sasebo to Samar, Philippine Islands. On the 24 November, Shaula was in the center of Typhoon Nora, containing winds in excess of . She lost one lifeboat and one life raft. The next day, she was still in the center of the typhoon. In heavy seas and rolling 47¬∞, Shaula lost two LCMs over the side. She reached Samar the next day and entered drydock for repairs. After they were completed, she operated in the Philippine Islands until departing for Shanghai, on 15 February 1946. She also visited Yokohama and Manus, before entering Pearl Harbor, on 3 May, en route to the U.S. West Coast. Decommissioning Shaula arrived at Seattle, Washington, on 31 May 1946, and prepared for decommissioning. She was returned to WSA on 25 June; stricken from the Navy List on 19 July 1946. She was sold to Italy, on 7 July 1947, and withdrawn from the fleet on 9 July 1947. Commercial history Renamed , she was temporarily used as an emigrant carrier but reverted to a cargo only role in 1951. Achille Lauro was a right wing politician who expanded out of cargo shipping into the emigrant business. She was a ship with basic accommodation which had been hastily crammed for emigrant passengers. She was included in the list of vessels on whose regular line voyages the International Refugee Organization proposed to make block bookings in the year to July 1950. In 1951 her passenger accommodation was removed and she sailed from 1952 to 1968, on Lauro's cargo-only service. Her route was Genoa to Australia via Naples, Italy, Suez, Aden, Bombay, Singapore, Fremantle and Sydney, Australia. In 1968 she was scrapped at La Spezia.

Origins After the murder of Gideon mentioned in the book of Alma and the execution of Nehor, the man who introduced priestcraft to the Nephites, there arose one after the order of Nehor whose name was Amlici. According to Chapter two of the Book of Alma, he was very cunning and wise according to the wisdom of the world (verse one) In verse two, he had gathered a great following of people. His people endeavored to make him King over the Nephites (). Now this was very alarming to the church and also to those who had not been persuaded by Amlici, because they knew according to the law that these things must be established by the voice of the people. It was especially alarming to the church which had been established by Alma because they feared that Amlici would \\"deprive them of their rights and privileges..., for it was his intent to destroy the church of God\\" (). When the people assembled to cast their voices on the matter, the whole debate became contentious between the two camps (). Further, the matter was laid before the judges of the land in the various assemblies of the people (). The voice of the people came back against Amlici and he was not made king over the Nephites (). Not content, Amlici stirred up his followers against those who were not in his favor (). He was consecrated king over his followers and he commanded that they take up their weapons of war against the Nephites to subject them to him. After this time his followers were known as Amlicites. () After the division After the division took place among the Nephites, there unfolded a war between the Amlicites and the Nephites (Alma 2:11). The Nephites were aware of their intentions and prepared for war, building up arms and appointing captains, higher captains and chief captains (Alma 2:12-13). Amlici prepared the Amlicites in much the same way, building up arms and appointing rulers and leaders of his people. The Amlicites distinguished themselves from the Nephites by marking themselves with red in their foreheads (). The Amlicites came up to the land of Zarahemla over the hill Amnihu which was east of the river Sidon and began to wage war. Alma the younger was the chief commander of the Nephite forces. Though many Nephites died in the battle, the Nephites overcame them due to the strengthening of the Lord and drove them with a great slaughter and pursued for the rest of the day until Alma and his forces could no longer. The Nephites broke camp in the valley of Gideon. (The man who was slain by Nehor.) () Afterwards, Alma sent Zeram, Amnor, Manti, and Limher to spy on the remnant of Amlicites so as to understand their plans. To their surprise they reported to Alma that the Amlicites were joined in the land of Minon, above Zarahemla, in the course of the land of Nephi, by a huge host of Lamanites. They were already making their way back towards Zarahelma. (Alma 2:21-25) Alma and his armies then left the valley of Gideon and moved across the river Sidon. They then were set upon by the hosts of Lamanites and Amlicites. A great battle ensued and the Nephites with the aid of God drove them back. Alma slew first Amlici and then drove back the king of the Lamanites and cleared the bank of the west side of Sidon and the joint army of Lamanites and Amlicites fled before the Nephites and went off into the wilderness (called Hermounts) out of the borders of Nephite Lands. () After the battle, the dead were buried but not numbered due to the greatness of the number that were slain. (Alma 3:1 also see Book of Mormon: Student Manual 121, chapter 22 section 13) Other references In chapter three, from verses four to eighteen, there is an explanation of how the Amlicites were now cursed with the Lamanites due to their marking themselves, just like God had set a mark upon the Lamanites. The Book of Mormon: Student Manual 121 suggests in chapter 22 section 14 that this may have been done so that the Lamanites could know who was an Amlicite ally and a Nephite. Some scholars, including Professor Royal Skousen, have proposed, based on spelling variations in the original manuscripts, that the \\"Amalekite\\" group appearing in the Book of Mormon is an alternative spelling of \\"Amlicite\\". Thus, Skousen's research into the original manuscripts used as the source for printing the Book of Mormon clarifies that the \\"Amalekites\\" and the \\"Amlicites\\" are not two separate groups, rather are apparently one and the same group. The original manuscripts provide evidence that this confusion arose due to human error in transcribing the Book of Mormon into English, as unfamiliar names were at times spelled inconsistently as the contents of the Book of Mormon were verbally dictated to the scribes. This confusion, while not having doctrinal implications for the book's contents, still exists in the Book of Mormon as of this 2016 writing. https://onoma.lib.byu.edu/onoma/index.php/Amalekite%28s%29_Amlicite%28s%29_Variant References *The Book of , in the Book of Mormon Book of Mormon peoples ","title":"Amlicites"},{"id":"12843467","text":"Brigadier General Lionel Warren de Vere Sadleir-Jackson CB, CMG, DSO & Bar, FRGS (31 December 1876 ‚Äì 21 May 1932) was an officer of the British Army who served in the Second Boer War and the First World War with distinction before taking command of the North Russia Relief Force which supervised the withdrawal of allied troops from the North Russia Campaign in the Russian Civil War.

South Africa Lionel Sadleir-Jackson was born on New Year's Eve 1876 to Major Henry Sadleir-Jackson of Midleton, County Cork. He joined the South Staffordshire Regiment of the Militia as a second lieutenant in 1896, and was promoted to lieutenant in 1897. He later took a regular army commission in the 9th Lancers, reverting to second lieutenant, aged 21 in May 1898. Shortly after receiving his regular commission he was dispatched to South Africa with his regiment to participate in the Second Boer War.P.190, Bloody Red Tabs, Davies & Maddocks During the war he was posted as a staff officer and saw extensive action, including at the battles of Belmont, Modder River and Magersfontein and Paardeberg, culminating in the relief of Kimberley. For his service in these actions, Sadleir-Jackson was promoted to lieutenant and continued service in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal.Sadleir-Jackson, LWdeV , Anglo Boer War, DSO recipients, Retrieved 20 August 2007 During 1900 he served on the General Staff in the Orange River Colony, seeing action at the battles of Bethlehem, Wittebergen and Caledon River, and being Mentioned in Despatches. He was Aide-de-Camp to Brigadier-General Malcolm Orme Little, commander of the 9th Lancers, May‚ÄìSeptember 1900. Wounded in action, he recovered, and continued on operations in the Colony and in Cape Colony during 1901. In the same year he was twice more Mentioned in Despatches, the second being for \\"Gallantry on several occasions\\". At the war's conclusion in 1902 he was further rewarded with another mention in dispatches, the Queen's South Africa Medal with seven clasps and the King's South Africa Medal with two and the award of the Distinguished Service Order. Two years later he was promoted to captain and served in India for several years. In 1909 he briefly resigned his commission, but quickly reversed the decision and served as an adjutant in the 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) regiment of the Territorial Army until 1912, when he moved to the Army Signal Corps. In the same year, he married Marion Fulton. First World War At the outbreak of the First World War, Sadleir-Jackson was sent to France with the Signal Corps, serving as a staff officer on communications and signals. Early on he received a further Mention in Despatches. For his service in this role, he was promoted to major made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1915. From 20 November 1916 ‚Äì 1 June 1917 he was Assistant Director of Signals (with the acting rank of lieutenant-colonel. Following that he was given acting rank and placed in command of the 10th Battalion of the London Regiment, a Territorial Army formation. He commanded them in the trenches during the summer of 1917 but in October he was promoted to acting Brigadier-General and given overall command of the 54th Brigade, part of the 18th Division. He was again Mentioned in Despatches in December 1917 and then received a brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel in early 1918. With this force, Sadleir-Jackson weathered the German attacks of the spring of 1918 and was heavily embroiled in the second battle of the Somme, particularly the battle of Albert on 21 August 1918. In heavy fighting around the town of Albert, Sadleir-Jackson's men took their objectives led from the front by their Brigadier, who was wounded in the knee by machine gun fire near Bellevue Farm. Although Sadleir-Jackson attempted to return to British lines he collapsed and was brought in by his men, the wound proving serious enough to keep him in England until after the Armistice. For his conduct during the attack he was presented with a bar to his Distinguished Service Order in September 1918: =Russia= In the autumn of 1918, Sadleir-Jackson was rewarded for his war service with the presentation of the Legion d'honneur and the Croix de Guerre with Star. The following year he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Despite these accolades, Sadleir-Jackson volunteered again in late 1918 to command the 2nd Brigade of the Russian Relief Force, a motley collection of units from the British Army, the Royal Navy, Australian volunteers, French and US troops and White Russians. This force was intended to hold the vital Northern ports of Arkhangelsk and Murmansk open for Allied cargo ships supplying the White Russian armies fighting in the region as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. In the event, Sadleir-Jackson found himself operating independently and frequently in overall charge of the North Russia Campaign which suffered from poor morale and supply and a lack of political direction. In a matter of months the situation was so critical that by September 1919 the entire force was evacuated, abandoning the region to the Bolshevik armies. Nevertheless, in the months of fighting which became particularly desperate in August 1919, Sadleir-Jackson's men performed well and fought hard, two Australian volunteers in the 45th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers even winning the Victoria Cross: Corporal Arthur Percy Sullivan and Sergeant Samuel George Pearse. Sadleir-Jackson performed well in enough to be again Mentioned in Despatches and be given a brevet promotion to colonel at the close of the campaign. Retirement Returning from Russia exhausted, he was appointed to command a brigade of the Territorial Army from 20 June 1920 ‚Äì 5 August 1921, receiving a substantive promotion to colonel to coincide with the start of the appointment. After this Sadleir-Jackson was transferred to a very different climate. Stationed in the newly gained British colonial territories in the Middle East he became Inspector of Levies for the freshly raised colonial forces there, including the Assyrian Levies. In 1923 he left this post for England, and took retirement in 1925 after 27 years in the army. He pursued his interests during his retirement, being a keen huntsman and big game hunter as well as an excellent polo player (in 1910 he co-wrote Hints on Polo Combination, with Walter Buckmaster). He was also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. In the late spring of 1932 he took a tour of the Somme battlefield, including the site of his wound fourteen years earlier. On 21 May 1932 he was driving near Peronne when he encountered a farm cart in the road and swerved too vigorously to avoid it, leaving the road and colliding with an electric pylon which severed the left front wheel and threw the car over. Lionel Sadleir-Jackson died shortly afterward at Estr√©es-en-Chauss√©e as the result of massive head injuries.

They are used for the therapy of acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock.  Medical uses  =Cardiac= Amrinone, milrinone and enoximone are used clinically for short-term treatment of cardiac failure in the presence of cardiogenic shock. PDE3 inhibitors are indicated as inotropics for the therapy of acute heart failure if catecholamines are ineffective. Well controlled studies have shown that these drugs generally increase mortality, when used for the therapy of acute heart failure, so they have to be applied under close observation. =Peripheral artery disease= Cilostazol is used for the treatment of intermittent claudication. This drug has a much weaker positive inotropic effect than those drugs used for the therapy of acute heart failure, and lacks significant adverse cardiac effects.  Contraindications  =Cardiac= Contraindications are severe obstructive cardiomyopathy, hypovolemia, tachycardia, and ventricular aneurysm. Breast feeding is prohibited during treatment.  Adverse effects  =Cardiac= The most important adverse effects when used for the therapy of acute heart failure are arrhythmia, thrombocytopenia and increased transaminase levels. Types Approved PDE3 inhibitors include the following: *amrinone *cilostazol *milrinone *enoximone *pimobendan (approved for use in dogs)  Mechanism of action  PDE3 inhibitors are a type of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of the PDE isoenzyme 3 leads to an increase of intracellular concentrations of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP mediates the phosphorylation of protein kinases, which in turn activates cardiac calcium channels. An increased calcium influx from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during phase 2 (the plateau phase) of the cardiac action potential leads to a positive inotropic effect of PDE3 inhibitors: they increase the force of cardiac contraction. Increased reflux of calcium into the SR following the plateau phase is responsible for their positive lusitropic effect: they increase relaxation speed. Additionally, PDE3 inhibitors act as vasodilators.  Chemical properties  = First generation PDE3 inhibitors = Recognition that the knowledge about PDE could be used to develop drugs that were PDE inhibitors led to extensive research. Most studies used analogues of the nucleotide substrates or derivatives of natural product inhibitors such as xanthine (e.g. theophylline) and papaverine. The active site of PDE3 can be considered as a summary of ideas about receptor topography resulting from the first generation inhibitors. The model of the Wells et al. version as cited in Erhardt and Chou (1991) includes the following: # A phosphate binding area # A lipophilic area that accommodates the non-polar side of the ribose moiety # A pyrimidine binding site # An imidazole binding site portion of the pyrimidine binding site # A sterically hindered site # An area with bulk tolerance = Second generation PDE3 inhibitors = Since selective PDE3 inhibitors were recognised to be cardiotonic drugs there has been great interest in developing new drugs in this category. A large number of heterocyclic compounds have been synthesized during related research. These compounds constitute a second generation of PDE inhibitors. Although they have been directed mostly at PDE3, they present significant structure-activity relationship for the PDEs in general. H (heterocycle) ‚Äì P (phenyl) ‚Äì I (imidazole) pattern of CI-930 A \\"heterocycle-phenyl-imidazole\\" (H-P-I) pattern has been considered to be necessary for positive inotropic activity in cardiac muscle and many second generation inhibitors fit this pattern. The heterocycle region: Within each heterocycle there is the presence of a dipole and an adjacent acid proton (an amide function). These atoms are believed to mimic the electrophilic center in the phosphate group in cAMP and are confirmed as the primary site of binding. The heterocycle is a transition state analogue inhibitor of PDE. Alkyl groups, limited to either methyl or ethyl, on the heterocyclic ring usually enhance potency, with occasional exceptions. The phenyl region: It seems that an electron rich centre, such as phenyl, needs to be present. The beneficial effects of small alkyl groups on the heterocycle could be to twist the central ring away from exact coplanarity with the heterocyclic ring. There is a similar twist in cAMP and there is general agreement that high affinity PDE3 inhibitors should adopt an energetically favoured planar conformation that mimics the anti conformation of cAMP. The imidazole region: Various substituents have been placed at the para-position of the central phenyl ring. They are electron rich moieties and apparently a positively charged moiety cannot be tolerated in this region of the PDE receptor. There is general agreement about this inhibitor potency: lactam ‚â• alkyl-CONH- ‚â• imidazoyl = pyridine in place of the central phenyl with its nitrogen in the analogous 4 position ‚â• alkyl-S- > simple ether > halide = amine > imidazolium (which is totally inactive). Identification of features common to the most selective inhibitors has led to a \\"five-point model\\" with: # Presence of a strong dipole (carbonyl moiety) at one end of the molecule. # An adjacent acid proton. # A small sized alkyl substituent on the heterocyclic ring. # A relatively flat overall topography. # An electron rich centre and/or a hydrogen bond acceptor site opposite to the dipole.  Examples of selective PDE3 inhibitors  { align=\\"right\\" Theophylline, a non-selective inhibitor Meribendan, a highly selective inhibitor } CI-930, the parent compound of meribendan Theophylline is a non-selective agent. In contrast, meribendan is a highly selective inhibitor. Also, meribendan has a higher level of selectivity in comparison with the parent compound CI-930 because, beside the basic nitrogen adjacent to the lactam moiety it possesses another basic nitrogen (benzimidazole ring), opposite to the primary binding site.

She is described as having \\"given a voice to the voiceless\\" and herself saw her role as a poet as \\"profoundly political\\". Her first poem was published in 1899 in Taraz, and in 1900 her first short story appeared in the journal Aghbyur. After founding the first Hunchakian women's political group in Alexandropol, Kurghinian fled to Rostov on Don in order to escape arrests of the tsarist regime. Her first volume of poetry, Ringing of the Dawn, was published in 1907, and one of her poems from this volume, \\"The Eagle's Love,\\" was translated and included in Alice Stone Blackwell's second anthology Armenian Poems: Rendered into English Verse (1917). After the Russian Revolution, in 1921 she returned to Soviet Armenia where she lived until her death. Throughout her lifetime, Kurghinian cultivated significant relationships with famous members of the Armenian artistic and literary worlds of her time, including Vrtanes Papazian, Avetik Isahakian, Hovhannes Toumanian, Hrand Nazariantz and others. Biography Shushanik Kurghinyan Shushanik Kurghinian (born Popoljian) was born in Alexandropol, (present-day Gyumri), Armenia, into a family of artisans. The young Shushanik benefited from the expansion of Armenian education to the working-class and attended an all-girls' primary school at a local monastery, before attending the Alexandropol Arghutian Girls' School. In 1895 she studied at a Russian gymnasium, which was one of the many schools instituted by Tsar Alexander III to russify the Caucasus and expand the borders of Imperial Russia. At her school Kurghinian's literary ambition was known and encouraged by her teachers. At twenty-one she married Arshak Kurghinian, a member of the socialist underground in the Caucasus. In 1903 she moved to Rostov on Don with her two children, while Arshak stayed in Alexandropol. Experiencing utmost hardship and poverty, Kurghinian immersed herself in the Russian revolutionary milieu and some of her most powerfully charged poetry was written between 1907‚Äì1909, during the years of her affiliation with Rostov's proletarian underground. Arshaluysi ghoghanjner (Ringing of the Dawn), her first book of poetry was published in Nor Nakhijevan in 1907. It was a direct response to the failed revolution of 1905 and was published with the assistance of Aleksandr Myasnikyan. Kurghinian's second volume was heavily criticized and rejected by tsarist censorship. From the late 1910s to the October Revolution, she continued to write and participate in social projects, but her activities were curtailed by fragile health. In 1921, the year after the sovietization of Armenia, she moved back to Alexandropol, her native city. In 1925 she traveled to Kharkov and Moscow for medical treatment and returned home disappointed. In 1926, after the Leninakan (Alexandropol) earthquake, she settled in Yerevan, where she was welcomed with great enthusiasm by literary circles. Due to health complications, Kurghinian died at the age of fifty-one in Yerevan on 24 November 1927. She was buried in the Komitas Pantheon-Park. Kurghinian is considered one of the founders of feminist and proletarian literature in Armenian.Victoria Rowe, A History of Armenian Women's Writing, 1880‚Äì1922 (London: Cambridge Scholars, 2003), page 170. .

Three elderly former opera-singers, who often worked together, are sitting out on the terrace. Reginald is quietly reading a serious book, but jovial, priapic Wilfred is chuckling about sex, as he regards Cissy, lying back and listening to music through her headphones. They are about to be joined by newcomer Jean, who was a major star in her day and to whom Reginald was once unhappily married. Is there any chance that these four will ever sing together again? A gala concert is about to take place at the retirement home to celebrate Verdi's birthday. Three of the four are keen to recreate the third act quartet \\"Bella figlia dell'amore\\" from Rigoletto and one is not. But the play eventually moves to an uncertain conclusion when they don costumes and lip-synch to their own retro recording. Critical reaction Writing for The Independent, Paul Taylor described the play as \\"an unashamed ‚Äì no, shameless ‚Äì vehicle for four feisty old troupers whose task is to make us laugh a little, sigh a little and cry a little as they take us into the bittersweet world of facing up to age and mortality.\\"The Independent, 10 September 1999 Charles Spencer for The Daily Telegraph wrote: \\"the show's heart is in the right place and a cherishable company of senior thesps give it everything they've got, breathing vitality into a script that could be an inert embarrassment if performed by less accomplished players.\\"The Daily Telegraph, 10 September 1999 Reviewing the play for The Spectator, Sheridan Morley concluded: \\"Harwood seems to have set out with something sad to say about the ravages of age on a profession which largely depends on staying young, but then to have been sidetracked into a sort of Three Tenors concert celebration without the Three Tenors. So his play doesn‚Äôt end, it just stops, and we are left with nothing more than the memory of four performances desperately trying to make bricks despite a distinct lack of straw; if Harwood has anything new to tell us about singers who have for different reasons lost their voices and yet are now going unquietly into that good night he seems, like his characters, to have abruptly and irretrievably forgotten what he was going to say. And the rest is a kind of silence.\\"The Spectator, 18 September 1999 Film adaptation The play was adapted as a film by Harwood himself in 2012.

This served as a pretext for Date Masamune to invade Shiomatsu and the Date clan soon took control of Otemori Castle, one of the satellite castles of Obama. In 1586, ≈åuchi Sadatsuna fled to the Ashina territories and Masamune entered Obama Castle without battle.Harimaya Sengoku warlord data base Later, Date Masamune used the castle as a base for attacking the Hatakeyama clan, and stayed in this castle until August 1586.

Its last assignment was with Air Defense Command, based at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. It was inactivated on 1 February 1959. History =World War II=  B-29 development  The 58th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Heavy) was constituted on 22 April and activated on 1 May 1943 at Smoky Hill AAF, Kansas. The wing's mission was to train the first Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircrews and help prepare the new aircraft for operational combat duty. On 1 June 1943 the wing was reassigned to the Boeing manufacturing plant at Marietta Army Air Field, Georgia in advance of delivery of the first YB-29 prototypes. By July, seven YB-29s had been delivered to the USAAF and were used to equip new training squadrons of the 472d Bombardment Group, the first operational group of the 58th Bomb Wing. In August 1943, it was decided that 58th Bombardment Wing would be stationed in the China Burma India Theatre by the end of 1943 and would begin attacking Japanese home island targets by flying out of bases in China. It would be commanded by General Kenneth B. Wolfe and would consist of four operational groups of B-29s. It was envisaged that once sufficient numbers of B-29s were available, Japan could be forced out of the war within six months by the destruction of her war industries, making a costly seaborne invasion of the home islands unnecessary. It was projected that such a program could defeat Japan by mid-1945. On 15 September 1943, the headquarters of the 58th BW was moved to Smoky Hill AAF, with some of its groups near the Wichita factory. The 58th Bomb Wing however, initially had 5 groups (the 40th, 444th, 462d, 468th, and 472d Bombardment Groups). The 40th was reassigned from Sixth Air Force in the Caribbean, the others were newly formed. The 472d Group was destined to remain at Smoky Hill Field as an operational training unit (OTU), and the others were to be deployed to India. President Roosevelt wanted the B-29 bombing raids against Japan to start by January 1944. However, delays in the B-29 program forced General Arnold to admit to the President that the bombing campaign against Japan could not begin until May 1944 at the earliest. The crew training program was one of the more difficult aspects of the entire B-29 program. Because of the complexity of the B-29 aircraft, a lengthy process of crew integration was required before combat operations could begin. There was no time to start from scratch, so volunteers were called for from B-24 crews returning from operations in Europe and North Africa. The crews of the B-29 needed a degree of specialist training that was not required for crews of other, less complex Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress or Consolidated B-24 Liberator aircraft. It usually took 27 weeks to train a pilot, 15 to train a navigator, and 12 to train a gunner. The complexity of the B-29 was such that a lengthy process of crew integration had to take place before combat deployment could begin. Although a total of 97 B-29s had been produced by the beginning of 1944, only 16 of the aircraft were really airworthy. Most of the others were in AAF modification centers, located near the Bell-Marietta and Martin-Omaha plants and at air bases in Kansas, undergoing a series of modifications and changes necessitated by the lessons of air combat over Europe. At that time, much of the equipment and components of the Superfortress had still not been perfected, and rather than delay production by stopping the assembly lines to incorporate modifications and add new equipment, it was decided to let the first production airplanes leave the lines at Wichita deficient in combat readiness and deliver them to these USAAF modification centers to bring them up to combat standards. Crews began to arrive at Kansas bases in November 1943, but few bombers were ready to receive them. At that time, there was only one Superfortress for every twelve crews, and most crews had to train on Martin Martin B-26 Marauders or Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. By the end of December, only 67 pilots had managed to fly a B-29 and few crews had been brought together as a complete team. Many gunners did not even see their first B-29 until early 1944. It was not until December 1943 that the decision not to use the B-29 against Germany was finally made, and to concentrate the B-29 exclusively against Japan. However, in early 1944, the B-29s were still not ready to begin Roosevelt's promised offensive against Japan Most of the B-29s were still held up at the modification centers, awaiting conversion to full combat readiness. By March 1944, the B-29 modification program had fallen into complete chaos, with absolutely no bombers being considered as combat ready. The program was seriously hampered by the need to work in the open air in inclement weather, by delays in acquiring the necessary tools and support equipment, and by the USAAF's general lack of experience with the B-29. Operations in India and Tinian B-29 taking off from Chakulia, June 1944Aircraft is Serial 42-6310 B-29 on an unfinished airfield in China, 1944Aircraft is Serial 42-74738 B-29s of the 462d Bomb Group West Field, Tinian After much effort, the headquarters of the XX Bomber Command had been established at the former RAF Kharagpur Airfield, India on 28 March 1944 under the command of General Wolfe. The first B-29 reached its base in India on 2 April 1944. In India, existing airfields at Kharagpur, Chakulia, Piardoba and Dudkhundi had been converted for B-29 use. All of these bases were located in southern Bengal and were not far from port facilities at Calcutta. All of these bases had originally been established in 1942‚Äì43 for Consolidated B-24 Liberators. The conditions at these bases were poor, and the runways were still in the process of being lengthened when the first B-29s arrived. The headquarters of the 58th BW, together with the four squadrons of the 40th Bombardment Group (the 25th 44th, 45th, and 395th) were assigned to the airfield at Chakulia, the first planes arriving there on 2 April 1944. The Headquarters was moved to Kharagpur airfield on 23 April. The 444th Bombardment Group (676th, 677th, 678th and 679th Squadrons) went to Charra, arriving there on 11 April. The 462d Bombardment Group (768th, 769th, 770th, and 771st squadrons) to Piardoba, arriving there on 7 April. The 468th Bombardment Group (792nd, 793rd, 794th and 795th Squadrons) arrived at Kharagpur on 13 April. The 444th Bombardment Group later moved to a permanent airfield at Dudhkundi, leaving Charra to become a transport base for the C-87s and C-46s which would support the effort. On 4 April 1944, a special strategic formation, the Twentieth Air Force, was established, which would carry out the aerial assault against Japan. This was done at the insistence of General Arnold himself, mainly to avoid having the B-29s being diverted to tactical missions under pressure from CBI theatre commanders. Twentieth Air Force would be commanded by General Arnold himself at Joint Chiefs of Staff level. It would be completely autonomous and their B-29s would be completely independent of other command structures and would be dedicated exclusively against strategic targets in Japan. The operational vehicle was to be the 58th Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy) of XX Bomber Command. The primary flaw in flying from bases in China was the fact that all the supplies of fuel, bombs, and spares needed to support the forward bases in China had to be flown in from India over the Hump, since Japanese control of the seas around the Chinese coast made seaborne supply of China impossible. The first B-29 bombing raid took place on 5 June 1944. Led by General Saunders himself, 98 B-29s took off from bases in eastern India to attack the Makasan railroad yards at Bangkok, Thailand. This involved a 2261-mile round trip, the longest bombing mission yet attempted during the war. On 13 July 1944, General Saunders combined the personnel of the 58th Wing into headquarters, XX Bomber Command, attaching the wing's personnel to the appropriate division of the command's staff. Although the wing continued to exist as a papr unit, it had no further operational functions in India.Cate, p. 124 By late 1944, it was becoming apparent that B-29 operations against Japan staged out of bases in Chengtu were far too expensive in men and materials and would have to be stopped. In December 1944, the Joint Chiefs of Staff made the decision that the 58th Bombardment Wing's B-29s would be moved to newly captured bases in the Marianas in the central Pacific. The 58th Bomb Wing flew its last operations from India and China on 8 February 1945. The wing moved to Tinian in early 1945 and was reassigned to the XXI Bomber Command on 29 March. The wing continued bombardment operations against Japan. Its units made daylight attacks from high altitudes on strategic targets, participated in incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. After the Japanese surrender, groups of the 58th Bomb Wing dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners of war in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show of force missions. =Strategic Air Command= The 58th Bomb Wing returned to the United States late in 1945, being assigned to March Field, California. It was reassigned to Continental Air Forces, later Strategic Air Command, on 21 March 1946. The newly formed Strategic Air Command was ill-equipped. it had inherited the headquarters buildings previously occupied by the Continental Air Forces at Bolling Field in Washington, D.C. and some of \\"operational assets\\" that had been assigned to it. On 7 June 1946, Eighth Air Force was relocated to MacDill Field, Florida, from Okinawa and assigned as one of SAC's two Numbered Air Forces, (the other being Fifteenth Air Force) but it was only moved on paper; it did not involve the moving personnel or equipment. The 58th Bomb Wing was assigned to Eighth Air Force. In fact, Eighth Air Force headquarters were manned chiefly by personnel from the 58th Bombardment Wing stationed at Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas. SAC's bomb wings were drastically undermanned and under equipped. Not all had aircraft. At the close of 1946, demobilization was in full swing and few were fully equipped and manned. The entire Strategic Air Command had a total of 148 bombers, all B-29s. Virtually all were equipped to drop conventional bombs, as the United States then had only nine Atomic Bombs and only a few B-29s of the 509th Group to deliver them if necessary. The Truman Administration was determined to balance the national budget. It seemed as if America's vast military power was no longer needed, so appropriations were drastically slashed. One unit after another was disbanded. The command staff and all personnel of the wing were eliminated on 1 November 1946 and the organization was reduced to a paper unit.

Life Ferdinand Richardt, the son of Johan Joachim Richardt and Johanne Frederikke n√©e Bohse, was born in Brede, north of Copenhagen in 1819. His father ran the inn/company store at the Brede factory. In 1832 the family relocated to nearby √òrholm to operate the inn at the paper-factory there. In 1839, they moved to Copenhagen. Ferdinand became briefly a carpenter's apprentice in 1835, but soon decided on a career in fine art, following the lead of his brother Carl. Beginning in 1836 Ferdinand studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Art under the architect and designer Gustav Friedrich Hetsch, the historical painter J. L. Lund and the classical sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Richardt was awarded the Academy's small and large silver medals in 1839 and 1840, respectively. In 1847, he received a five-year stipend from the crown, on the condition that he deliver one architectural and one landscape painting each year to the royal collection. Between 1855 and 1859 he visited in the United States. He maintained a studio in New York City, while traveling during the summers to Niagara Falls and to various destinations east of the Mississippi River. After returning to Denmark, Richardt married the widow Sophia Schneider n√©e Linnemann (1831-1888) in 1862. They traveled for part of a year in southern Europe, and from 1863 they lived for a period in England. In February 1864, Queen Victoria invited Richardt to display his art work to the court at Windsor Castle. In 1872 and 1873, Richardt sold many of his accumulated paintings and lithographs before emigrating to the United States with his family. They lived first in the town of Niagara Falls, N.Y. where the artist again produced canvases depicting the great waterfall and the surrounding area. In 1875, the Richardts moved to San Francisco, and finally in 1876 to Oakland. For the remaining twenty years of his life Richardt was active as a painter of California landscapes with a concentration on the San Francisco Bay Area. He exhibited and sold his works in San Francisco until at least 1887. At the same time he taught drawing privately. At his death in 1895, Richardt left a daughter, Johanna (1862-1897), and a stepson, Joost Schneider. Paintings Niagara Falls painted by Richardt Underneath Niagara Falls by Richardt (1862) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Richardt created hundreds of oil paintings, mostly of landscapes, castles, manors, and various tourist attractions. He was a recognized painter in his own lifetime. Today, his paintings are held and exhibited by museums and other public institutions in the United States and Denmark; two hang in The White House, Washington, D.C. Richardt's 1856 painting Niagara Falls was chosen to be the backdrop for the customary luncheon following the Second inauguration of Barack Obama in Statuary Hall. New York Senator Charles Schumer, the Chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, stated why he chose the painting: \\"For me as a New Yorker, Niagara Falls never fails to inspire a tremendous awe for the natural beauty of our great country. Then and now, the mighty falls symbolize the grandeur, power and possibility of America.\\" Selected paintings * Thorvaldsen in his studio at Charlottenborg, 1840.

Drawings and Lithographs Klintholm Manor, from Pictures of Danish Manors During the 1840s, 50s and 60s, Richardt travelled in Denmark and Sweden, and made numerous drawings of manor houses etc. These were lithographed with the best techniques of the time, and published along with descriptions by well-known historians in the books: * Views of Danish Manors (Prospecter af danske Herregaarde), 80 portfolios 1844-68 showing a total of 240 manor houses. Republished with condensed text in 1976. * Danish Churches, Castles, Manors and Memorials (Danske Kirker, Slotte, Herregaarde og Mindesm√¶rker), 12 portfolios 1867-68 with a total of 56 pictures. * Scanian Manors (Sk√•nska herreg√•rdar), 24 portfolios 1852-63, with a total of 78 pictures. * Manors in S√∂dermanland (Herreg√•rdar uti S√∂dermanland), 12 portfolios 1864-69 with a total of 57 pictures, some in color. These works were very popular at the time. Today, they are of great historical interest. Richardt drew a vast number of pictures besides those published. These served as studies for his hundreds of oil paintings and for other print works. At his death, more than 1,000 Danish and American drawings passed to his daughter, and later to his stepson. The drawings were considered to be lost, until the 1990s when American scholar and cultural historian Melinda Young Stuart located them in the possession of Justine van Hemert Keller, the grandchild of Richardt's stepson. Over 500 of the original drawings, on which Richardt's paintings and lithographs were based, are preserved in the archives of Denmark's Nationalmuseet, a gift of the artist's great-granddaughter. Other drawings are held at the Oakland Museum of California, the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, and elsewhere. In 2003, more than 100 of the newly found drawings were reproduced, along with other works by Richardt in the book Danish Manorhouses and America (see below). A copy of this book was presented as a gift by the Danish prime minister's wife to the American First Lady when she came to Copenhagen on an official visit. In 2007, 55 of Richardt's American drawings were exhibited at the Munson-Williams- Proctor Arts Institute; a catalogue was published (see below). The exhibit later traveled to the Grand Rapids Art Museum where it was on view during the summer of 2008.

History This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on March 5, 1990, originally serving Bay Minette, Alabama. The new station was assigned the call letters WUIF by the FCC on May 3, 1990. Just over a month later, on June 4, 1990, the station was assigned new call sign WFMI. The new station began broadcasting a soft adult contemporary music format in mid-1993 under program test authority. The station had the moniker \\"LiteMix 106.5\\". After several extensions, renewals, and changes, WFMI received its license to cover from the FCC on August 25, 1993. The station was assigned the current WAVH call sign on October 14, 1994. The FCC authorized WAVH to change its community of license to Daphne, Alabama, on November 29, 1996. In June 1997, the Baldwin Broadcasting Company reached an agreement to sell this station to American General Media through their AGM-Nevada, LLC, subsidiary. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 5, 1997, but the transaction was never consummated and control of the station remained with Baldwin Broadcasting. In November 2000, the Baldwin Broadcasting Company faced financial difficulties and an application was made to transfer control of WAVH to Baldwin Broadcasting Company, Debtor-In-Possession. The transfer was approved by the FCC on December 8, 2000, and the transaction was consummated on December 12, 2000. In May 2002, Baldwin Broadcasting Company, Debtor-In-Possession, reached an agreement to sell this station to Cumulus Media through the Cumulus Licensing Corporation subsidiary for a reported $5.11 million. The deal was never gained FCC approval and the application was dismissed at the request of both parties to the transaction on November 15, 2004. At the time of the announcement, WAVH broadcast an oldies music format. In March 2007, Baldwin Broadcasting Company, Debtor-In-Possession, reached an agreement to transfer the broadcast license for this station to Barry Wood, doing business as the Baldwin Broadcasting Company. The deal was approved by the FCC on May 15, 2007, and the transaction was consummated on May 23, 2007. Just a few months later, in October 2007, Barry Wood reached an agreement to sell this station to Donald Bigler's Bigler Broadcasting, LLC, for a reported $3.6 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 27, 2007, and the transaction was consummated on January 31, 2008. The station operated as an oldies station called \\"Oldies 106\\" until August 2006. The switch was noted by a constant play of Jimmy Buffett songs. From August 2006 through April 2009, WAVH was an adult hits music formatted station branded as \\"106.5 The Pirate\\" with the slogan \\"70s, 80s, and Whatever We Want!\\" The talk format, branded as \\"FM Talk 106-5\\", launched on May 1, 2009.

Scandinavian, German, Russian, Latvian, Lithuanian and other influences have played their part. The most typical foods in Estonia have been rye bread, pork, potatoes and dairy products.Eesti Toit infoserver v2.0.3.0 Estonian eating habits have historically been closely linked to the seasons. In terms of staples, Estonia belongs firmly to the beer, vodka, rye bread and pork \\"belt\\" of Europe. Cold table Flounder The first course in traditional Estonian cuisine is based on cold dishes‚Äîa selection of pickles, meats and sausages served with potato salad () or , an Estonian signature dish almost identical to Swedish , based on beetroot, potatoes and herring.Estonia By Michael Spilling Small pastries called ( in the singular)‚Äîa relative of the ‚Äîfilled with meat, cabbage, carrots, rice and other fillings or mixtures are also popular, and are often served with bouillion. Herring is common among other fish as a part of the Estonian cold table. Smoked or marinated eel, crayfish dishes, and imported crabs and shrimps are considered delicacies. One of Estonia's national dishes is (Baltic dwarf herring), along with sprats. Flounder, perch and pike-perch are also popular. Kiluv√µileib In the 20th century, a special sandwich called kiluv√µileib has become popular. This sandwich consists of a traditional rye bread open sandwich with thin layer of butter and a layer of v√ºrtsikilu (pickled Baltic sprats) as topping. Boiled egg slices, mayonnaise and culinary herbs are optional extra toppings. Soups Soups may be eaten before the main course, but traditionally form the main meal and most often are made of meat or chicken stock mixed with a variety of vegetables. Soups are also blended with sour cream, milk and yogurt. Pea soup is also quite popular. A unique form of Estonian soup is (\\"bread soup\\"), which is a type of sweet soup that is made of black bread and apples, normally served with sour cream or whipped cream, often seasoned with cinnamon and sugar. Main course Black rye bread (rukkileib) is also eaten as a pub snack. Black rye bread () accompanies almost every savory food in Estonia. Estonians continue to value their varieties of black rye-based bread. Desserts currant kissell Specific desserts include kissell, curd snack and kama. Other common Estonian desserts are (a cream made of semolina and juice or fruit), (creamy curd) or compote (kompott). Rhubarb pies are also a favorite. Another popular dessert is kringle (), a sweet yeast bread often flavored with cardamom. Drinks Local wines are mainly fruit wines. A traditionally popular drink called ‚Äîsimilar to Russian ‚Äîis becoming more popular again. Mead (), the drink that was most popular in ancient times, has almost completely disappeared. Birch sap () beverages are also quite popular. Nowadays, locally brewed beer is the number one choice to accompany food; different juices or simply water being the main non-alcoholic choice. Wine is widely drunk, and although it is still not as popular as beer, it is becoming all the more common. There are also Estonian fruit wines made of apples or different berries. Estonians are also proud of their vodka and other spirits, such as the herbal liqueur Vana Tallinn. Two of Estonia's oldest breweries are A. Le Coq, founded in 1807, and Saku Brewery, founded in 1820. Milk () is also widely drunk by children as well as adults. Other dairy products besides milk include keefir and also (\\"sour milk\\") and , which are variations on the theme of buttermilk. Dairy from Andre, Estonia is well known as part of Estonian dairy-related cuisine. Seasons =Summer and spring= Traditionally in summer and spring, Estonians like to eat everything fresh‚Äîberries, herbs, vegetables and everything else that comes straight from the garden. Hunting and fishing were common in history. Nowadays, they have remained as popular pastimes. It is popular to barbecue in the summer. =Winter and Christmas= During the winter months, jam, preserves and pickles are brought to the table. During the past, when the economy was largely agricultural, the gathering and conserving of fruits, mushrooms and vegetables for winter was essential. Today, gathering and conserving is less common because almost everything can be bought from stores, but preparing food for winter is still very popular in the countryside and continues to retain its charm for many, as opposed to the commercialization of eating habits. Blood sausage (verivorst), roast goose (j√µuluhani), sepik bread, head cheese (s√ºlt), and sauerkraut (hapukapsas) with oven-roasted potatoes have been part of the traditional Estonian menu that nowadays are mostly Christmas specialties. Also, typical Christmas treats have been apples, mandarin oranges, gingerbread and lingonberry jam.

It is defined as \\"the dispersal of contaminated altered genes from genetically engineered organisms to natural organisms, esp. by cross- pollination\\", but has come to be used in some broader ways. It is related to the population genetics concept of gene flow, and genetic rescue, which is genetic material intentionally introduced to increase the fitness of a population. It is called genetic pollution when it negatively impacts on the fitness of a population, such as through outbreeding depression and the introduction of unwanted phenotypes which can lead to extinction. Conservation biologists and conservationists have used the term to describe gene flow from domestic, feral, and non-native species into wild indigenous species, which they consider undesirable. They promote awareness of the effects of introduced invasive species that may \\"hybridize with native species, causing genetic pollution\\". In the fields of agriculture, agroforestry and animal husbandry, genetic pollution is used to describe gene flows between genetically engineered species and wild relatives. The use of the word \\"pollution\\" is meant to convey the idea that mixing genetic information is bad for the environment, but because the mixing of genetic information can lead to a variety of outcomes, \\"pollution\\" may not always be the most accurate descriptor.  Gene flow to wild population  Some conservation biologists and conservationists have used genetic pollution for a number of years as a term to describe gene flow from a non-native, invasive subspecies, domestic, or genetically-engineered population to a wild indigenous population. = Importance = The introduction of genetic material into the gene pool of a population by human intervention can have both positive and negative effects on populations. When genetic material is intentionally introduced to increase the fitness of a population, this is called genetic rescue. When genetic material is unintentionally introduced to a population, this is called genetic pollution and can negatively affect the fitness of a population (primarily through outbreeding depression), introduce other unwanted phenotypes, or theoretically lead to extinction. = Introduced species = An introduced species is one that is not native to a given population that is either intentionally or accidentally brought into a given ecosystem. Effects of introduction are highly variable, but if an introduced species has a major negative impact on its new environment, it can be considered an invasive species. One such example is the introduction of the Asian Longhorned beetle in North America, which was first detected in 1996 in Brooklyn, New York. It is believed that these beetles were introduced through cargo at trade ports. The beetles are highly damaging to the environment, and are estimated to cause risk to 35% of urban trees, excluding natural forests.Haack, Robert A., et al. Managing Invasive Populations of Asian Longhorned Beetle and Citrus Longhorned Beetle: A Worldwide Perspective. vol. 55, Annual Review of Entomology, 2010, Managing Invasive Populations of Asian Longhorned Beetle and Citrus Longhorned Beetle: A Worldwide Perspective. These beetles cause severe damage to the wood of trees by larval funneling. Their presence in the ecosystem destabilizes community structure, having a negative influence on many species in the system. Introduced species are not always disruptive to an environment, however. Tom√°s Carlo and Jason Gleditch of Penn State University found that the number of invasive honeysuckle plants in the area correlated with the number and diversity of the birds in the Happy Valley Region of Pennsylvania, suggesting introduced honeysuckle plants and birds formed a mutually beneficial relationship.2011, Invasive Plants Can Create Positive Ecological Change. Presence of introduced honeysuckle was associated with higher diversity of the bird populations in that area, demonstrating that introduced species are not always detrimental to a given environment and it is completely context dependent.  Invasive species  Conservation biologists and conservationists have, for a number of years, used the term to describe gene flow from domestic, feral, and non-native species into wild indigenous species, which they consider undesirable. For example, TRAFFIC is the international wildlife trade monitoring network that works to limit trade in wild plants and animals so that it is not a threat to conservationist goals. They promote awareness of the effects of introduced invasive species that may \\"hybridize with native species, causing genetic pollution\\". Furthermore, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the statutory adviser to the UK government, has stated that invasive species \\"will alter the genetic pool (a process called genetic pollution), which is an irreversible change.\\"Effects of the introduction of invasive/non-native species - Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), a statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation. Accessed on November 25, 2007. : \\"Occasionally non-native species can reproduce with native species and produce hybrids, which will alter the genetic pool (a process called genetic pollution), which is an irreversible change.\\" Invasive species can invade both large and small native populations and have a profound effect. Upon invasion, invasive species interbreed with native species to form sterile or more evolutionarily fit hybrids that can outcompete the native populations. Invasive species can cause extinctions of small populations on islands that are particularly vulnerable due to their smaller amounts of genetic diversity. In these populations, local adaptations can be disrupted by the introduction of new genes that may not be as suitable for the small island environments. For example, the Cercocarpus traskiae of the Catalina Island off the coast of California has faced near extinction with only a single population remaining due to the hybridization of its offspring with Cercocarpus betuloides. = Domestic populations = Increased contact between wild and domesticated populations of organisms can lead to reproductive interactions that are detrimental to the wild population's ability to survive. A wild population is one that lives in natural areas and is not regularly looked after by humans. This contrasts with domesticated populations that live in human controlled areas and are regularly, and historically, in contact with humans. Genes from domesticated populations are added to wild populations as a result of reproduction. In many crop populations this can be the result of pollen traveling from farmed crops to neighboring wild plants of the same species. For farmed animals, this reproduction may happen as the result of escaped or released animals.  Aquaculture  Aquaculture is the practice of farming aquatic animals or plants for the purpose of consumption. This practice is becoming increasingly common for the production of salmon. This is specifically termed aquaculture of salmonoids. One of the dangers of this practice is the possibility of domesticated salmon breaking free from their containment. The occurrence of escaping incidents is becoming increasingly common as aquaculture gains popularity. Farming structures may be ineffective at holding the vast number of fast growing animals they house. Natural disasters, high tides, and other environmental occurrences can also trigger aquatic animal escapes. The reason these escapes are considered dangers is the impact they pose for the wild population they reproduce with after escaping. In many instances the wild population experiences a decreased likelihood of survival after reproducing with domesticated populations of salmon. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife cites that \\"commonly expressed concerns surrounding escaped Atlantic salmon include competition with native salmon, predation, disease transfer, hybridization, and colonization.\\" A report done by that organization in 1999 did not find that escaped salmon posed a significant risk to wild populations.  Crops  Crops refer to groups of plants grown for consumption. Despite domestication over many years, these plants are not so far removed from their wild relatives that they could reproduce if brought together. Many crops are still grown in the areas they originated and gene flow between crops and wild relatives impacts the evolution of wild populations. Farmers can avoid reproduction between the different populations by timing their planting of crops so that crops are not flowering when wild relatives would be. Domesticated crops have been changed through artificial selection and genetic engineering. The genetic make up of many crops is different than that of its wild relatives, but the closer they grow to one another the more likely they are to share genes through pollen. Gene flow persists between crops and wild counterparts. = Genetically engineered organisms = Genetically engineered organisms are genetically modified in a laboratory, and therefore distinct from those that were bred through artificial selection. In the fields of agriculture, agroforestry and animal husbandry, genetic pollution is being used to describe gene flows between GE species and wild relatives. An early use of the term \\"genetic pollution\\" in this later sense appears in a wide- ranging review of the potential ecological effects of genetic engineering in The Ecologist magazine in July 1989. It was also popularized by environmentalist Jeremy Rifkin in his 1998 book The Biotech Century. While intentional crossbreeding between two genetically distinct varieties is described as hybridization with the subsequent introgression of genes, Rifkin, who had played a leading role in the ethical debate for over a decade before, used genetic pollution to describe what he considered to be problems that might occur due to the unintentional process of (modernly) genetically modified organisms (GMOs) dispersing their genes into the natural environment by breeding with wild plants or animals. Concerns about negative consequences from gene flow between genetically engineered organisms and wild populations are valid. Most corn and soybean crops grown in the midwestern USA are genetically modified. There are corn and soybean varieties that are resistant to herbicides like glyphosate and corn that produces neonicotinoid pesticide within all of its tissues. These genetic modifications are meant to increase yields of crops but there is little evidence that yields actually increase. While scientists are concerned genetically engineered organisms can have negative effects on surrounding plant and animal communities, the risk of gene flow between genetically engineered organisms and wild populations is yet another concern. Many farmed crops may be weed resistant and reproduce with wild relatives. More research is necessary to understand how much gene flow between genetically engineered crops and wild populations occurs, and the impacts of genetic mixing.  Mutated organisms  Mutations within organisms can be executed through the process of exposing the organism to chemicals or radiation in order to generate mutations. This has been done in plants in order to create mutants that have a desired trait. These mutants can then be bred with other mutants or individuals that are not mutated in order to maintain the mutant trait. However, similar to the risks associated with introducing individuals to a certain environment, the variation created by mutated individuals could have a negative impact on native populations as well. Preventive measures Since 2005 there has existed a GM Contamination Register, launched for GeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International that records all incidents of intentional or accidental release of organisms genetically modified using modern techniques. Genetic use restriction technologies (GURTs) were developed for the purpose of property protection, but could be beneficial in preventing the dispersal of transgenes. GeneSafe technologies introduced a method that became known as \\"Terminator.\\" This method is based on seeds that produce sterile plants. This would prevent movement of transgenes into wild populations as hybridization would not be possible. However, this technology has never been deployed as it disproportionately negatively affects farmers in developing countries, who save seeds to use each year (whereas in developed countries, farmers generally buy seeds from seed production companies). Physical containment has also been utilized to prevent the escape of transgenes. Physical containment includes barriers such as filters in labs, screens in greenhouses, and isolation distances in the field. Isolation distances have not always been successful, such as transgene escape from an isolated field into the wild in herbicide- resistant bentgrass Agrostis stolonifera. Another suggested method that applies specifically to protection traits (e.g. pathogen resistance) is mitigation. Mitigation involves linking the positive trait (beneficial to fitness) to a trait that is negative (harmful to fitness) to wild but not domesticated individuals. In this case, if the protection trait was introduced to a weed, the negative trait would also be introduced in order to decrease overall fitness of the weed and decrease possibility of the individual‚Äôs reproduction and thus propagation of the transgene. Risks Not all genetically engineered organisms cause genetic pollution. Genetic engineering has a variety of uses and is specifically defined as a direct manipulation of the genome of an organism. Genetic pollution can occur in response to the introduction of a species that is not native to a particular environment, and genetically engineered organisms are examples of individuals that could cause genetic pollution following introduction. Due to these risks, studies have been done in order to assess the risks of genetic pollution associated with organisms that have been genetically engineered: # Genetic In a 10-year study of four different crops, none of the genetically engineered plants were found to be more invasive or more persistent than their conventional counterparts. An often cited claimed example of genetic pollution is the reputed discovery of transgenes from GE maize in landraces of maize in Oaxaca, Mexico. The report from Quist and Chapela, has since been discredited on methodological grounds. The scientific journal that originally published the study concluded that \\"the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper.\\" More recent attempts to replicate the original studies have concluded that genetically modified corn is absent from southern Mexico in 2003 and 2004. # A 2009 study verified the original findings of the controversial 2001 study, by finding transgenes in about 1% of 2000 samples of wild maize in Oaxaca, Mexico, despite Nature retracting the 2001 study and a second study failing to back up the findings of the initial study. The study found that the transgenes are common in some fields, but non-existent in others, hence explaining why a previous study failed to find them. Furthermore, not every laboratory method managed to find the transgenes. # A 2004 study performed near an Oregon field trial for a genetically modified variety of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) revealed that the transgene and its associate trait (resistance to the glyphosate herbicide) could be transmitted by wind pollination to resident plants of different Agrostis species, up to 14 km from the test field. In 2007, the Scotts Company, producer of the genetically modified bentgrass, agreed to pay a civil penalty of $500,000 to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA alleged that Scotts \\"failed to conduct a 2003 Oregon field trial in a manner which ensured that neither glyphosate-tolerant creeping bentgrass nor its offspring would persist in the environment\\". Not only are there risks in terms of genetic engineering, but there are risks that emerge from species hybridization. In Czechoslovakia, ibex were introduced from Turkey and Sinai to help promote the ibex population there, which caused hybrids that produced offspring too early, which caused the overall population to disappear completely.Genetic Rescue: a Safe or Risky Bet? The genes of each population of the ibex in Turkey and Sinai were locally adapted to their environments so when placed in a new environmental context did not flourish. Additionally, the environmental toll that may arise from the introduction of a new species may be so disruptive that the ecosystem is no longer able to sustain certain populations.  Controversy  = Environmentalist perspectives = The use of the word \\"pollution\\" in the term genetic pollution has a deliberate negative connotation and is meant to convey the idea that mixing genetic information is bad for the environment. However, because the mixing of genetic information can lead to a variety of outcomes, \\"pollution\\" may not be the most accurate descriptor. Gene flow is undesirable according to some environmentalists and conservationists, including groups such as Greenpeace, TRAFFIC, and GeneWatch UK.GE agriculture and genetic pollution web article hosted by Greenpeace.org > \\"Invasive species have been a major cause of extinction throughout the world > in the past few hundred years. Some of them prey on native wildlife, compete > with it for resources, or spread disease, while others may hybridize with > native species, causing \\"genetic pollution\\". In these ways, invasive species > are as big a threat to the balance of nature as the direct overexploitation > by humans of some species.\\" It can also be considered undesirable if it leads to a loss of fitness in the wild populations. The term can be associated with the gene flow from a mutation bred, synthetic organism or genetically engineered organism to a non GE organism, by those who consider such gene flow detrimental. These environmentalist groups stand in complete opposition to the development and production of genetically engineered organisms. = Governmental definition = From a governmental perspective, genetic pollution is defined as follows by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations: > \\"Uncontrolled spread of genetic information (frequently referring to > transgenes) into the genomes of organisms in which such genes are not > present in nature.\\" = Scientific perspectives = Use of the term 'genetic pollution' and similar phrases such as genetic deterioration, genetic swamping, genetic takeover, and genetic aggression, are being debated by scientists as many do not find it scientifically appropriate. Rhymer and Simberloff argue that these types of terms: > \\"...imply either that hybrids are less fit than the parentals, which need > not be the case, or that there is an inherent value in \\"pure\\" gene > pools.\\"[1] They recommend that gene flow from invasive species be termed genetic mixing since: > \\" \\"Mixing\\" need not be value-laden, and we use it here to denote mixing of > gene pools whether or not associated with a decline in fitness.\\"[1] Patrick Moore has questioned whether the term \\"genetic pollution\\" is more political than scientific. The term is considered to arouse emotional feelings towards the subject matter.[9] In an interview he comments: > \\"If you take a term used quite frequently these days, the term \\"genetic > pollution,\\" otherwise referred to as genetic contamination, it is a > propaganda term, not a technical or scientific term. Pollution and > contamination are both value judgments. By using the word \\"genetic\\" it gives > the public the impression that they are talking about something scientific > or technical--as if there were such a thing as genes that amount to > pollution.\\"[2] Thus, using the term \\"genetic pollution\\" is inherently political. A scientific approach to discussing gene flow between introduced and native species would be to use terms like genetic mixing or gene flow. Such mixing can definitely have negative consequences on the fitness of native populations, so it is important not to minimize the risk. However, because genetic mixing can also lead to fitness recovery in cases that could be described as \\"genetic rescue\\", it is important to distinguish that just mixing genes from introduced into native populations can lead to variable outcomes for the fitness of native populations. = Political perspectives = The term \\"genetic pollution\\" and \\"genetic admixture\\" is also used in ideological arguments by black supremacists in relation to mixing of ethnic groups within multi-cultural populations.

WKSJ-FM broadcasts a country music format to the Mobile metropolitan area. Notable programs include The Bobby Bones Show on mornings, Johnna on middays, Bill & Shelby on afternoons, Wayne D on nights, and the syndicated CMT After Midnite with Cody Alan from Premiere Networks overnight. History =Launch= On April 21, 1971, this station signed on as WZAM-FM under the ownership of Broadcast Enterprises, Inc., (who had in turn acquired it from the original permit holders Duke Broadcasting Co. on November 1, 1970) with 31,000 watts of power at 94.9 MHz. In 1972, the station changed its callsign to WKSJ. In 1974, the licensee changed to Capitol Broadcasting Corp. Later in the 1970s, former AM sister station WZAM (now WIJD) changed its callsign to WKSJ which forced a change in this station's call letters to the current WKSJ-FM. For legal and accounting purposes, the licensee of WKSJ-FM applied to the FCC to shift the license from Capitol Broadcasting Corp. (A West Virginia Corporation) to Capitol Broadcasting Corp. (An Alabama Corporation) in December 1985. The transfer was approved by the FCC on December 24, 1985. =1990s= In May 1992, Capitol Broadcasting Corporation agreed to sell this station to Franklin Communications Partners, L.P.

Thence, she loaded cargo at Davisville, Rhode Island, and Bayonne, New Jersey, before departing New York, for the Pacific Ocean 25 June, arriving Pearl Harbor, 25 July. Matar discharged cargo and refilled her holds with ammunition, field rations, and amphibious equipment. Operating under Service Squadron 8, she sailed with units of task force TF 31 on 20 August, for the Palaus. Steaming via the Marshalls and the Admiralties, Matar reached Kossol Passage, 20 September. As flagship for CTG 31.4, she operated at Kossol, until 17 October, when she departed for Angaur Island. From 19 to 24 October, she discharged cargo into boats for transfer to the beaches; thence, she embarked Marines and amphibious tanks at Peleliu, and sailed for the Russell Islands, 30 October. She debarked her troops there 7 November; arrived off Guadalcanal, 9 November; and embarked 130 troops. Departing Lunga, 18 November, she arrived San Francisco, California, via Pearl Harbor, 11 December.

She was the sister of French philosopher Henri Bergson, the first man of Jewish descent to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927.Wasson, Tyler. (1987) Nobel Prize Winners: An A.H.

Biography Moina, then named Mina, or Minna, was born in Geneva, Switzerland, to a talented and influential Polish-Jewish family from father's and English and Irish from mother's sides, moving to Paris, when she was but two years of age. Her father, Michel Bergson, achieved some musical success in composing the operas Louisa de Montfort and Salvator Rosa, he was a native of Warsaw and member of the influential Bereksohn family. Moina Mathers' grandfather, Jacob Levison (born c. 1799) was a surgeon and a dentist. Her grandmother was Katherine Levison, born in London in c. 1800. Her maternal aunt was Minna Preuss, born in Hull, Yorkshire, in 1835, and her mother, Kate, n√©e Levison, was also born in Yorkshire. Her eldest brother, was later Nobel Prize winner Henri Bergson, 1859‚Äì1941, joined the faculty of the College of France and is best known for authoring the philosophical work Creative Evolution. He was also the president of the British Society for Psychical Research.Greenburg, Louis. (1976) \\"Bergson and Durkheim As Sons and Assimilators: The Early Years.\\" French Historical Studies 9 Issue 4 pg. 619-634 Moina was a talented artist and joined the Slade School of Art, at the age of fifteen. The Slade was known for encouraging young women in the Arts, at the turn of the nineteenth century. Moina was awarded a scholarship and four merit certificates for drawing at the School. She became friends with Beatrice Offor, with whom she shared a studio. It was also at the Slade in 1882, that Moina met her future friend Annie Horniman, who would become the major financial sponsor for the Matherses, as struggling artists and occultists, in backing the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.Greer, (1995), pp. 40-45 Moina met her husband, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, in 1887, while studying at the British Museum, where Samuel was a frequent patron. A year later, her future husband founded the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, one of the most influential organisations in the Western Mystery Tradition. Moina was the first initiate of this Order in March, 1888. Her chosen motto in the Golden Dawn was Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum, meaning \\"Prudence never retraces its steps.\\" A year later in 1890, she married S. L. Mathers and Mina Bergson became Moina Mathers. In their occult partnership, her husband was described as the \\"evoker of spirits\\" and Moina as the clairvoyant \\"seeress\\", who often illustrated, as an artist, what her husband \\"evoked\\".Greer, 1995, pp.40-47 In March 1899, they performed the rites of the Egyptian goddess Isis, on the stage of the Th√©√¢tre La Bodini√®re in Paris.Greer, 1995, pp. 222-225 In 1918, when her husband died, Moina took over the Alpha et Omega, a successor organisation to the Golden Dawn, as its Imperatrix.Greer, 1995, pp. 348-358 She died in 1928 in London.

[no source of data provided] The group received logistical help from the Soviet Union, and financial aid from the Comintern. Ideology The main points of BPWU's program were: the democratic self-governance for West Belarus within Poland, introduction of an eight-hour working day, the recognition of the Belarusian language in Poland as a second official language, the cancellation of the \\"colonization of Belarus\\" by the Polish Osadniks, and the free distribution to peasants of land owned by landlords upon its confiscation. There was also a semi-official goal to unite all of Belarusians of West Belarus and East Belarus within one Soviet state. Background The Belarusian national flag as used by the Hramada and other Belarusian organizations in interwar Poland. Hramada was formed legally in July 1925. Its leaders were among prominent members of the Belarusian national liberation movement of the early 20th century: Symon Rak-Michajlo≈≠ski has previously been a high-ranking diplomat for the Belarusian Democratic Republic, Branis≈Ça≈≠ Tara≈°kieviƒç is known as the creator of the first modern Belarusian grammar. The Polish authorities began to suppress the activities of the Hramada in late 1926 due to its policy coordination with the delegalized Communist Party of Western Belarus. Belarusian media in Poland faced increased pressure and censorship from the authorities. Membership and structure Branis≈Ça≈≠ Tara≈°kieviƒç, one of the leaders of the BPWU Membership numbers of the Hramada grew on a very fast pace with sometimes entire Belarusian villages becoming members. By November 1926 the party has enrolled 120,000 members, which is believed to be the largest political party in Belarusian history today, and one of the largest revolutionary-democratic organizations of its time. The Hramada had party cells in the following powiats of the Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship in Second Polish Republic: Baranovichi (Baranowicze), Bielsk, Valozhyn (Wo≈Ço≈ºyn), Vawkavysk (Wo≈Çkowysk), Vileyka (Wilejka), Wilno, Grodno, Dzisna, Kosava, Lida, Maladzyechna, Navahrudak, Pastavy, Pinsk, Slonim, Stouptsy and Sok√≥≈Çka. The Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union Hramada established several periodicals devoted not only to politics, but also to culture and business, including Zyccio bielarusa, Bielaruskaja niva, Bielaruskaja sprava, Narodnaja sprava, and Nasa sprava. The total circulation of publications of the Hramada in early 1927 was above 10,000 copies. Radicalization and dissolution As the years went on, due to ongoing polonization of West Belarus (called Kresy macroregion in interwar Poland) and increasingly discriminatory and nationalistic policies of the central Polish government, the Belarusian national movement in grew more loyal to the Soviet regime and its communist ideology. The Soviets also gained increasingly more control over the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union, and gave the Belarusian national liberation movement in Poland a communist context. According to Polish sources in Belarus, the Hramada received not only logistical, but also physical help from the Soviet Union, and financial aid from the Comintern. The connection between Hramada and the delegalized Communist Party of Western Belarus aided by Moscow was inevitably discovered by the Polish authorities. On 15 January 1927 some top activists of Hramada were arrested under the charge of subversive anti-Polish activities. The trial of the leaders of Hramada became known as the Trial of the Fifty Six ().–ê–ª–µ—Å—å –ü–∞—à–∫–µ–≤—ñ—á. –°—ã–º–æ–Ω –†–∞–∫-–ú—ñ—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ—û—Å–∫—ñ: —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–Ω–∫—ñ –∂—ã—Ü—Ü—è —ñ –¥–∑–µ–π–Ω–∞—Å—Ü—ñ. (Alie≈õ Pa≈°kieviƒç, Symon Rak-Michajlo≈≠ski: staronki ≈æyccia i dziejnasci.) The leaders including Branis≈Ça≈≠ Tara≈°kieviƒç, Symon Rak-Michaj≈Ço≈≠ski, Piotra Miat≈Ça, and Pavie≈Ç Va≈Ço≈°yn, were each sentenced to 12 years in prison. The Polish authorities handed them over to the Soviets in 1930 (Rak-Michaj≈Ço≈≠ski, Va≈Ço≈°yn, Miat≈Ça) and 1933 (Tara≈°kieviƒç) in exchange for political prisoners held in the USSR (including the West Belarusian journalist and playwright Franci≈°ak Alachnoviƒç). A few years later, all four former leaders of the Hramada were either executed by the Soviet regime as \\"Polish spies\\" or sent to perish in the GULAG. In the aftermath of the party's de-legalisation, on February 3, 1927 a riot erupted in Kosava where the Soviet diversionist cell was already formed by Moscow with all required help. Polish police responded to attacks with fire, killing 6 people and wounding several dozens. Historical role, legacy and criticism According to historian Andrew Savchenko, by 1927 the Hramada organization was controlled entirely by agents deployed from Moscow, whose aim was to destabilize the region and recruit partisans. According to Polish media, the Hramada turned into a cover for infiltration of Poland by the Soviet Union. According to Savchenko, BPWU only theoretically demanded independence for Belarus, but in practice promoted only the idea of incorporating the ethnically Belarusian lands into the Soviet Union which meant yet another partition of Poland. The Russian agents attempted to isolate the Belarusian ethnic minority in Poland from the political process in the country. In turn, Hramada leaders did exactly what their Moscow advisers suggested they do, and disseminated Comintern propaganda, which resulted in the rapid growth of its rank and file. By March 1927 the party had 120,000 members. The membership of the Communist Party decreased at the same time by a thousand. In Belarus, the BPWU is viewed positively by both the official regime and the opposition. It is seen as a mass democratic party that emerged in West Belarus as a response to harsh ethnic discrimination of the Belarusians in mid-war Poland. It is being pointed out that the Hramada was persecuted by both the Polish regime and by the Stalinist USSR.

In this literature an \\"economic catalyst\\" is an entity that has (a) two or more groups of customers; (b) who need each other in some way; but (c) can't capture the value from their mutual attraction on their own; and (d) rely on the catalyst to facilitate value-reaction reactions between them.

Diners Club was the first modern payment card, introduced in 1950. To create this product Diners Club had to get two groups of customers on board. Consumers who wanted to pay with a card and merchants who wanted to accept payment with this card. These two groups of customers each wanted the card to consummate transactions between them.

The short form of the name in some Slavic languages is Tanya (). Variations  Origin Tatiana is a female name of Sabine and Latin origin, a feminine derivative of the Sabine-Latin name Tatius. Titus Tatius was the name of a king of the Sabines, an Italic tribe living near Rome, presumably from the 8th to the 1st century BC. Because the Romans met with the Sabines, the name Tatius remained in use in Ancient Rome and during the first centuries of Christianity, as well as its diminutive Tatianus and the feminine Tatiana. The name then disappeared from Western Europe, but remained prevalent in the Hellenic world (Eastern Roman Empire), and later spread to the Orthodox world, including Russia. It honors the Orthodox Saint Tatiana who was tortured and martyred in the persecutions of Emperor Alexander Severus c. 230 in Rome. Saint Tatiana is also considered a patron saint of Moscow State University in particular and all Russian students in general. Hence, Tatiana Day is celebrated as Students' Day on January 25th. In popular culture Tatiana Larina is the heroine of Alexander Pushkin's verse novel Eugene Onegin. The poem was and continues to be extremely popular in Russia. The character of Tatiana Larina inspired the names of two Romanovs: Princess Tatiana Constantinovna of Russia and her distant cousin Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia.

It is in the Cathays district of the city, about north of Cardiff city centre. At 110 acres it is the third largest cemetery in the United Kingdom. History Monument to Frank Baselow The cemetery was opened in 1859 and originally had two chapels: one Anglican and the other non-conformist, and each including its own porte-coch√®re. The cemetery has a Roman Catholic section, where a Roman Catholic chapel was built later. In the Second World War, air raids damaged Cathays Cemetery with a number of bombs and an aerial mine. In the 20th century all three chapels were neglected and in the 1980s the Roman Catholic one was demolished. Since 2008 the Anglican and non-conformist chapels have been undergoing restoration. The chapels, as well as the cemetery gateway and forecourt walls, are Grade II listed buildings. During the early/mid 1970s the cemetery was split into two sections to allow the building of the A48 Eastern Avenue which was a continuation of the A48(M). One of the most imposing memorials is that of Frank Baselow, thought to be a result of Baselow's European heritage (his actual name was Franz) and the taste on the Continent for grand memorials. =War graves= Commonwealth War Graves section The cemetery has a Commonwealth War Graves (CWGC) section, marked by a Cross of Sacrifice made to the standard design devised by Reginald Blomfield. The section was established in the First World War, when Cardiff's nearby main hospitals treated numerous servicemen who had been wounded in action, or who contracted influenza in the 1918‚Äì19 influenza pandemic. The war graves section includes a number of graves of Australian and Canadian servicemen, one New Zealander who died while serving in the Royal Defence Corps, and one soldier of the Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment. Also present is the grave of Jacques Vaillant de Gu√©lis, a Special Operations Executive agent. The cemetery includes the graves of 21 French Navy sailors from the First World War, mostly are in the Roman Catholic section, and a similar number of Norwegian sailors from the Second. Elsewhere in the cemetery are numerous other Commonwealth War Graves from both the First and Second World Wars.

Piadinas are not only Sammarinese dishes but are also common in the surrounding region, Emilia Romagna. As San Marino is a microstate completely landlocked by Italy, Sammarinese cuisine is strongly similar to Italian cuisine, especially that of the adjoining Emilia- Romagna and Marche regions. San Marino's primary agricultural products are cheese, wine and livestock, and cheesemaking is a primary economic activity in San Marino. San Marino participated in The Exposition Universelle of 1889, a world's fair held in Paris, France, with three exhibits of oils and cheese. Dishes Local savoury dishes include fagioli con le cotiche, a Christmas bean and bacon soup; pasta e ceci, a chickpea and noodle soup with garlic and rosemary; nidi di rondine, a baked pasta dish with smoked ham, beef, cheese, and a tomato sauce; and roast rabbit with fennel. Erbazzone is a spinach-based dish that includes cheese and onions.

Dowie, from an 1890 publication. M√©nie Muriel Dowie (15 July 1867 ‚Äì 25 March 1945) was a British writer. Early life and education Dowie was born in Liverpool to Annie Dowie and James Muir Dowie, a merchant. Dowie's maternal grandfather was a Scottish author and a publisher, Robert Chambers. Educated in Liverpool, Stuttgart, and France, she spent her early twenties travelling. Her best-known tour, in the summer of 1890, was through the Carpathian Mountains, where she travelled alone and on horseback. Her travelogue, A Girl in the Karpathians, was published the following year, and she lectured to packed audiences. She lived for a time with Lillias Campbell Davidson, American founder of the British Lady Cyclists' Association, and Alice Werner, later a professor of Swahili and Bantu languages. According to the New York Times: (This book is not to be confused with one of the same title published in Chicago immediately before it hosted World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Enid Yandell was one of a group of women sculptors known as the White Rabbits, who were asked at the last minute to complete the numerous statues and other architectural embellishments. Yandell co-wrote a semi-autobiographical account of her involvement in planning the fair.) In 1891, Dowie married a journalist who was also a travel writer, Henry Norman, and over the next years travelled extensively with him. Their son, Henry Nigel St Valery Norman, was born in 1897. Writing career In 1895, her first novel, Gallia, was published. It caused some controversy concerning its depiction of sexual relationships and clearly marked Dowie as one of the New Woman writers. Her contemporary, English novelist George Gissing, considered the novel \\"not at all a bad book\\".Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.366. Apart from other occasional writing, she published two more novels, The Crook of the Bough (1898), a satirical story describing contemporary attitudes to women in Turkey, and Love and His Mask (1901), about the Boer War. Divorce and later life In 1903, Henry Norman divorced her, causing a scandal by publicly accusing her of adultery with mountaineer Edward Fitzgerald. Dowie withdrew from the literary scene and married Fitzgerald later that year. Their marriage was childless. Years of extensive travel followed. in 1915, Henry Norman was made a Baronet. Though divorced from Dowie, their son had been born during the term of the marriage, and thus became heir to the baronetcy on Norman's death in 1939. In England, Dowie settled down on a farm and became a well-known cattle breeder, exhibiting pedigree Red Poll at shows around England and exporting livestock to Mombasa, Kenya. Dowie separated from Fitzgerald in 1928, and the latter died in 1931. Suffering from asthma, and also believing that Great Britain was going to lose the war, Dowie emigrated to the United States in 1941. In 1943 her son, by then Sir Henry Nigel St Valery Norman, 2nd Baronet, an Air Commodore in the Auxiliary Air Force (Reserve) and a father of three, was killed in an aircraft accident, aged 45. Dowie died in Tucson, Arizona in 1945, aged 77. Notes References *Stephanie Forward: s.v. \\"Dowie, M√©nie Muriel\\". The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, ed.

Early years The Brooklyn- born Handelman was a late 1960s fixture on programs such as The Merv Griffin Show, Dean Martin Presents the Golddiggers, The Barbara McNair Show, The Flip Wilson Show, The Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. His stooped, resigned appearance and surreal sense of humor (\\"I just got up from a sick bed. I don't know what's wrong with it--it just lies there\\") made him a highly-recognizable celebrity on the talk show circuit and resulted in about ten appearances on Johnny Carson. After the demise of the TV variety shows, he accepted a handful of acting roles and subsequently taught the art of stand-up comedy in Los Angeles. According to the Third Amendment and Complete Restatement of the Rodney Dangerfield Trust, there were two bequests regarding Handelman. The first was to distribute to Handelman upon Dangerfield's death the sum of $10,000 in cash (page six, 4.3 (f).) The second was to distribute during Handelman's lifetime the sum of $800 per month (page nine, 6.3 (a).) Marriages Handelman married four times, and had four sons and one daughter.

A prominent dish in Kuwaiti cuisine is machboos, a rice-based specialty usually prepared with basmati rice seasoned with spices, and chicken or mutton (pork is highly restricted due to religious reasons). Seafood is a very significant part of the Kuwaiti diet, especially fish. Local favourites are hamour (grouper), which is typically served grilled, fried, or with biryani rice because of its texture and taste, safi (rabbitfish), maid (mulletfish) and sobaity (sea bream). Kuwait's traditional flatbread is called Iranian khubz. It is a large flatbread baked in a special oven and it is often topped with sesame seeds. Numerous local bakeries dot the country, the bakers are mainly Iranians (hence the name of the bread Iranian khubuz). Bread is often served with mahyawa fish sauce. There are many other cuisines available due to the international workforce in Kuwait.

On May 3, 1733 he married Elizabeth Winslow, who has been variously said to be the daughter of Edmund, Isaac, and Col. Edward Winslow. It is probable that she was the Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Winslow and Elizabeth his wife, whose birth of February 16, 1712 is recorded in the Boston records.Boston Births, 1700-1800, p. 87. Both Richard Clarke and his wife were of distinguished ancestry and occupied a high social position. Richard had graduated from Harvard College in 1729 and became one of the most prominent merchants in Boston, his firm at the time of the American Revolution including his two sons, Jonathan and Isaac, under the name of Richard Clarke & Sons. Jonathan was in London in 1773 and Richard Clarke & Sons were named as factors for the Honourable East India Company and were among the consignees of the tea which was thrown into Boston Harbor in December of that year, in the Boston Tea Party. On November 2, they had received a letter signed \\"O. C.,\\" ordering them to appear at the Liberty Tree the following Wednesday at noon to make a public resignation of their commission as factors. On Wednesday morning some of the other consignees, including Thomas Hutchinson Jr. (son of the governor), Benjamin Faneuil, and Joshua Winslow, met the Clarkes at their warehouse on King Street. A mob of about five hundred had gathered at the Liberty Tree and, as the merchants did not appear, a considerable number gathered in front of the warehouse. Nine of them went in as emissaries to induce the merchants to yield, and, when they refused to do so, the mob attempted to storm the building but was repulsed. When Jonathan arrived from England there was a gathering of friends at the Clarkes' house in School Street to welcome him, which led to another attack by the mob. The Clarke firm at first refused to sign the Non-Importation Agreement, but afterward consented. Richard Clarke was also one of the signers of the Address to Gen. Gage. The family had become extremely unpopular with the Whigs, and when, on one occasion, Isaac went to Plymouth to collect some debts, he was attacked and forced to make a midnight escape. Susannah Farnum Clarke, one of Richard's four daughters, had married the artist John Singleton Copley in 1769 and had gone to live with him in London. In view of the growing difficulties in Boston, Clarke decided to go to England also, and after a remarkable voyage of only twenty-one days landed there on December 24, 1775, and lived at Copley's house until his death. With one of his sons he joined the Loyalist Club of London. The family was on the American proscription lists, but in his will Clarke disposed of considerable property, including Bank of England stock and American securities.

Biography  He was born in New York City in the United States where, he claimed, his Irish parents were on a business trip at the time, and soon after returned with them to Ireland. He grew up in Camlough, County Armagh, and was equally fluent in Irish and English. In 1906, when he was 14, Donn-Byrne went to an Irish Volunteer Movement meeting with Bulmer Hobson and Robert Lynd of the London Daily News, where Lynd noticed him, a fair-haired boy, and wrote of his singing. It was through Hobson that Byrne acquired his taste for Irish history and nationalism. (The \\"taste for nationalism\\" cited, is contested by Bradley. Many may confuse widespread interest in Irish Language and Byrne's excellence in the language, his prizes at feiseanna (festivals) with a more revolutionary political movement engaged in by Hobson and other associates). He attended the University of Dublin, beginning in 1907, where he studied Romance languages and saw his own writing published in The National Student, the student magazine. After graduation he continued his studies in Europe, hoping to join the British Foreign Office. It is related that he \\"turned down his PhD\\" when he learned that he would have to wear evening clothes to his early morning examinations, which he apparently felt that no true Irish gentleman would ever do. (The latter claim is shown by Bradley to be just one of Byrne's impossible, if entertaining, fantasies) He returned to New York in 1911, where he began working first for the publishers of the Catholic Encyclopedia, the New Standard Dictionary, and then the Century Dictionary. In February 1912 his poem \\"The Piper\\" appeared in Harper's magazine. His first short story, \\"Battle,\\" sold soon after to Smart Set magazine for $50, appearing in the February 1914 issue. He sold more stories; some of these were anthologised in his first book, Stories Without Women, 1915. He then began working on his first novel, The Stranger's Banquet (1919). He was a prolific novelist and short story writer from that point on. His novel Field of Honor was published posthumously in 1929. His poems were collected into an anthology and published as Poems (1934). Despite both his wife Dorothea's success as a playwright, and his own increasing popularity as an author, Byrne's financial straits forced his family to sell their house in Riverside, Connecticut, and return to Ireland. They later purchased Coolmain Castle, near Bandon in County Cork, where Byrne lived until his death in a car accident due to defective steering,New York Times, 20 June 1928 in June 1928. A Kilbrittain man Cornelius O'Sullivan who witnessed the incident pulled him from the water and tried to revive him, but to no avail. He is buried in Rathclarin churchyard, near Coolmain Castle. His headstone reads, in Irish and English: \\"I am in my sleeping and don't waken me.\\"It first appears in Ireland: The Rock Whence I Was Hewn, where Byrne concludes with the following poem: The bells of heather/ Have ceased ringing their Angelus./ Sleepy June weather/ Has instilled a drug in us.// The cry of the plover/ Is hushed, and the friendly dark/ Has drawn a blue hood over/ The meadow lark.// We travel sleeping,/ Over heather hill and through ferny dale,/ To the Land of No Weeping,/ Of races, and piping and ale.// Hushenn! Hushoo!// The wind is hid in the mountain. The leaves/ are still on the tree./ The hawk is caged in the darkness. The field-/ mouse safe in the hay./ Now I am in my sleeping, and don't waken me./ Tha mee mo hulloo is na dhooshy may!/ Tha mee, Tha mee--/ Golden mammy!/ Tha mee mo hulloo is na dhooshy may!/ I am in my sleeping and don't waken me!// Quoted from the National Geographic version. (Vol. 51, no. 3, March 1927, page 316).  Writings  The early novels can be said to be quite mediocre, noted as \\"potboilers\\" by Thurston Macauley, Byrne's earliest biographer. Messsa Marco Polo tells the story of the Italian adventurer as told by an Irishman, and The Wind Bloweth is a romantic novel of the sea. Both show some highly lyrical passages intermixed with the plain language of real life. With Blind Raftery, however, the author seems to reinvent the saga style, the prose breaking off into musical verse now and then as it tells the story of a blind poet wandering Ireland and avenging his wife's dishonor. A television opera by Joan Trimble based on the novel was commissioned and broadcast by the BBC in 1957.Radio Times Issue 1749, 19 May 1957, p 6, 17 His later novels invited comparison with Irish novelist George Moore, especially in their romance and historical themes. It was with Hangman's House, though, that he began to identify himself with the traditional Irish storytellers, noting in his preface (\\"A Foreword to Foreigner's\\") that: \\"I have written a book of Ireland for Irishmen. Some phrase, some name in it may conjure up the world they knew as children.\\" It is also in this novel that Byrne returns to his Irish nationalist ideas by alluding to the ongoing strife of the Irish Civil War and fight for Independence. Byrne was firmly of the neo-Romantic view of the mythical and pastoral beauty of Irish history. His writing hauntingly evokes these images, sometimes seeming want to preserve them. \\"It seemed to me,\\" he says in Wind, \\"that I was capturing for an instant a beauty that was dying slowly, imperceptibly, but would soon be gone.\\" His simple narrative style recalls the atmosphere of ancient oral epics such as Taine Bo Cualinge and the Epic of Gilgamesh. Some of the works were published in the United Kingdom under different titles. These are also noted after the American title.

The group includes people from China, Hong Kong and Overseas Chinese who have immigrated to Trinidad and Tobago and their descendants, including those who have emigrated to other countries (especially the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, but also to other countries including China). The term is usually applied both to people of mixed and unmixed Chinese ancestry, although the former usually appear as mixed race in census figures. Chinese settlement began in 1806. Between 1853 and 1866 2,645 Chinese immigrants arrived in Trinidad as indentured labour for the sugar and cacao plantations. Immigration peaked in the first half of the twentieth century, but was sharply curtailed after the Chinese Revolution in 1949. After peaking at 8,361 in 1960, the (unmixed) Chinese population in Trinidad declined to 3,800 in 2000, however slightly increased to 3,984 in 2011. Community The Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian community is a diverse mixture that includes first-generation immigrants from China, Trinidadians whose ancestors have lived in Trinidad for many generations and diasporan Trinidadians and Tobagonians, who have primarily settled in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The Chinese Trinidadian community includes people of unmixed and mixed Chinese ancestry, although the latter usually appear as mixed race in census figures in Trinidad and Tobago. Most Trinidadian Chinese originate from Guangdong Province, especially among the Hakka Han people and Cantonese Han people. Cantonese-speaking Han Chinese of Trinidad and Tobago number 5500 History The Chinese community in Trinidad and Tobago traces its origin to the 12 October 1806 arrival of the ship Fortitude carrying a group of Chinese men recruited in Macau, Penang and Calcutta. This was the first organised settlement of Chinese people in the Caribbean, preceding the importation of Chinese indentured labour by over 40 years. It was intended to be the first step in a plan to establish a settlement of free labourers and peasant farmers in what was then a newly acquired British colony. Royal Navy Captain William Layman suggested that it would be cheaper to establish new sugar plantations using free Chinese labour than it would with African slaves. At the same time, British officials concerned in the aftermath of the Haitian Revolution suggested that the settlement of Chinese immigrants in Trinidad would provide a buffer between the enslaved Africans and the whites. In December 1805, a Portuguese captain recruited 141 Chinese men in Macau and shipped them to Penang where six more men were recruited. Another 53 men were recruited in Calcutta, bringing the total to 200. The survivors of this group arrived in Trinidad eight months later. Kim Johnson reports that 194 men survived the journey, while Walton Look Lai reports that there were 192 men. The group settled at Surveillance Estate in Cocorite, on the western edge of Port of Spain, the capital. Given the lack of farmland near the city, the group requested permission to hire themselves out as labourers. Fifteen were hired to work as seine fishers, and one worked as a shoemaker. After one year in Trinidad, 17 of the migrants had died. Sixty-one of them departed with the Fortitude in July 1807. By 1810 only 22 of them remained in Trinidad, and only seven remained in 1834, the last time that the community was mentioned. The 1833 abolition of slavery in the British Empire led to labour shortages in Trinidad. Indentured labourers were imported from various parts of the world including India and Madeira. Between 1853 and 1866 2,645 Chinese immigrants arrived in Trinidad ‚Äì 2,336 men, 309 women and 4 children ‚Äì on eight ships. These immigrants constituted the second wave of Chinese immigration to Trinidad. The third wave began after the Chinese revolution in 1911 and continued until the Chinese Revolution of 1949. Most of these immigrants were brought to Trinidad and Tobago through the efforts of earlier immigrants. The fourth wave of immigration began in the late 1970s and continues. Additional immigrants settled in Trinidad after initially migrating to other parts of the Caribbean, especially British Guiana which received 13,593 indentured immigrants from China between 1853 and 1884.

The current Constitution is the Annex 4 of The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, also known as the Dayton Agreement, signed on 14 December 1995. The Constitution saw the end of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however it has seen a large amount of criticism. Under the supervision of international community, an \\"arrangement of amendments\\" (later called \\"April arrangement of amendments\\") to the Constitution, agreed upon by leading political parties, was proposed for adoption in the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina in April 2006, but it failed to get the approval of two-thirds of members in the House of Representatives. In four cases since 2009, the European Court of Human Rights has determined that the constitution discriminates against Jews, Roma, and other Bosnian citizens who are not Croat, Serb, or Bosniak for running for president. The constitution has yet to be amended. Nature of the Constitution The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the constitution in international contractual form, since it is an integral part of a larger peace agreement signed by Alija Izetbegoviƒá, Franjo Tuƒëman and Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, three presidents of countries involved in war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the representatives of European Union (Felipe Gonz√°lez), United States (Bill Clinton), Germany (Helmut Kohl), United Kingdom (John Major), France (Jacques Chirac) and Russia (Viktor Chernomyrdin). This nature of the Constitution was also of vital importance for the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in its landmark decision on constituency of peoples (U-5/98), since it declared that the Constitution could be interpreted as a treaty defined in Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties from 1969, which was of great importance in the interpretation of the Preamble of the Constitution. The Preamble The Preamble states, among other things, the commitment of Bosnia and Herzegovina to freedom, equality, tolerance and democratic institutions of government. It also states that the carriers of sovereignty are \\"constituent peoples\\" (Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs), along with \\"Others\\" and \\"citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina\\", which has also seen a great amount of debate between legal scholars over an apparent contradiction.

The Constitution also states that no amendment to the Constitution can eliminate or diminish any of the rights and freedoms referred to in Article II of the Constitution (Article X, 2.). The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina has made several notable decisions in the interpretation of these provisions, with most important being the \\"Decision on the Constituency of Peoples\\" (U-5/98). Still there are great criticisms of the Constitution, stating that it is of discriminatory nature, since in many of its articles it discriminates against citizens that are not from \\"constituent peoples\\", such as the Article V which sets out the rules for the election of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There has been an attempt to challenge the Electoral law, which has the basis in the Constitution, which is seen as being discriminatory to \\"Others\\", as well as to \\"constituent peoples\\" to some degree, by trying to interpret the Article II(2) in a way that the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its Protocols have the supremacy over the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina itself. However, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina declined this position in its decision number U-5/04. This has led Jakob Finci, the leader of Jewish community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to file a suit against Bosnia and Herzegovina in front of European Court of Human Rights, which acknowledged his ineligibility for Presidency and House of Peoples to be in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a special court sui generis, whose main role is to be the interpreter and guardian of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as stated in Article VI, paragraph 3 of the Constitution (\\"The Constitutional Court shall uphold this Constitution\\"), and it is considered to be the highest judicial authority, since it has the appellate jurisdiction over issues under the Constitution arising out of a judgement of any other court in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Article VI, paragraph 3.b). Amending the Constitution In the Article X, defining the amendment procedure, the Constitution states that it can be amended by a decision of the Parliamentary Assembly, including a two-thirds majority of those present and voting in the House of Representatives. The Constitution does not say who has the right, and under what rules, to present the amendments to the Parliamentary Assembly. Also, in the paragraph 2 of the Article X, the Constitution states that the rights and freedoms, as seen in the Article II, cannot be derogated, as well as the paragraph 2 itself. Violation of European Convention of Human Rights In 2009, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in Sejdiƒá and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, a case filed by Dervo Sejdic and Jakob Finci, two Bosnian citizens of Romani and Jewish ethnicity, and are therefore ineligible for running for president. The court determined that this restriction (an estimated 400,000 Bosnian citizens, 12 per cent of the population, cannot run for president due to their religion, ethnicity, or place of residence) violates the European Convention of Human Rights. Three subsequent cases also found that the constitution is discriminatory. However, as of 2019 it has yet to be amended.

Poetry in Slovene language achieved its highest level with the Romantic poet France Pre≈°eren (1800‚Äì1849). In the 20th century, the Slovene literary fiction went through several periods: the beginning of the century was marked by the authors of the Slovene Modernism, with the most influential Slovene writer and playwright, Ivan Cankar; it was then followed by expressionism (Sreƒçko Kosovel), avantgardism (Anton Podbev≈°ek, Ferdo Delak) and social realism (Ciril Kosmaƒç, Pre≈æihov Voranc) before World War II, the poetry of resistance and revolution (Karel Destovnik Kajuh, Matej Bor) during the war, and intimism (Poems of the Four, 1953), post-war modernism (Edvard Kocbek), and existentialism (Dane Zajc) after the war. Short stories became a popular genre after the 1990s. There are several Slovene literary magazines that publish prose, poetry, essays, and local literary criticism. =Children's literature and poetry= Music =Classical music= Music of Slovenia historically includes numerous musicians and composers, such as the Renaissance composer Jacobus Gallus (1550‚Äì1591), who greatly influenced Central European classical music and the Baroque composer Janez Krstnik Dolar (ca. 1620‚Äì1673). During the medieval era, secular music was as popular as church music, including wandering minnesingers. By the time of Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, music was used to proselytize. The first Slovenian hymnal, Eni Psalmi, was published in 1567. This period saw the rise of musicians like Jacobus Gallus and Jurij Slatkonja.Oto Luthar The land between: a history of Slovenia In 1701, Johann Berthold von H√∂ffer (1667‚Äì1718), a nobleman and amateur composer from Ljubljana, founded the Academia Philharmonicorum Labacensis, as one of the oldest such institutions in Europe, based on Italian models.George J. Buelow (2004) A history of baroque music, p.701 Composers of Slovenian Lieder and art songs include Emil Adamiƒç (1877‚Äì1936), Fran Gerbiƒç (1840‚Äì1917), Alojz Ger≈æiniƒç (1915‚Äì2008), Benjamin Ipavec (1829‚Äì1908), Davorin Jenko (1835‚Äì1914), Anton Lajovic (1878‚Äì1960), Kamilo Ma≈°ek (1831‚Äì1859), Josip Pavƒçiƒç (1870‚Äì1949), Zorko Prelovec (1887‚Äì1939), and Lucijan Marija ≈†kerjanc (1900‚Äì1973). In the early 20th century, impressionism was spreading across Slovenia, which soon produced composers Marij Kogoj and Slavko Osterc. Avant-garde classical music arose in Slovenia in the 1960s, largely due to the work of Uro≈° Krek, Dane ≈†kerl, Primo≈æ Ramov≈° and Ivo Petriƒá, who also conducted the Slavko Osterc Ensemble. Jakob Je≈æ, Darijan Bo≈æiƒç, Lojze Lebiƒç and Vinko Globokar have since composed enduring works, especially Globokar's L'Armonia, an opera. Modern composers include Uro≈° Rojko, Toma≈æ Svete, Brina Je≈æ-Brezav≈°ƒçek, Bo≈æidar Kantu≈°er and Aldo Kumar. Kumar's Sonata z igro 12 (A sonata with a play 12), a set of variations on a rising chromatic scale, is particularly notable. =Opera= The Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre serves as the national opera and ballet house. =Film music= The composer of film scoress for 170 films was Bojan Adamiƒç (1912‚Äì1995). =Folk music= Vocal Harmony singing is a deep rooted tradition in Slovenia, and is at least three-part singing (four voices), while in some regions even up to eight-part singing (nine voices). Slovenian folk songs, thus, usually resounds soft and harmonious, and are very seldom in minor. Instrumental Traditional Slovenian folk music is performed on Styrian harmonica (the oldest type of accordion), fiddle, clarinet, zithers, flute, and by brass bands of alpine type. In eastern Slovenia, fiddle and cimbalon bands are called velike goslarije. Slovenian country music Folk musician Lojze Slak From 1952 on, the Slavko Avsenik's band began to appear in broadcasts, movies, and concerts all over the West Germany, inventing the original \\"Oberkrainer\\" country sound that has become the primary vehicle of ethnic musical expression not only in Slovenia, but also in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and in the Benelux, spawning hundreds of Alpine orchestras in the process. The band produced nearly 1000 original compositions, an integral part of the Slovenian-style polka legacy. Avsenik's most popular instrumental composition is the polka that is titled \\"Na Golici\\" (in Slovene), or \\"Trompetenecho\\" (in German), and \\"Trumpet Echoes\\" (in English). Oberkrainer music, which the Avsenik Ensemble popularized, is always a strong candidate for country (folk) music awards in Slovenia and Austria. Many musicians followed Avsenik's steps, one of the most famous being Lojze Slak. =Slovenska popevka= A similarly high standing in Slovene culture, like the Sanremo Music Festival has had in Italian culture, was attributed to the Slovenska popevka, a specific genre of popular Slovene music.Slovenska popevka: velik poudarek na pevcih in skladateljih, pesniki bolj v oklepaju.

After 1990, Adi Smolar, Iztok Mlakar, Vita Mavriƒç, Vlado Kreslin, Zoran Predin, Peter Lov≈°in, and Magnifico have been popular in Slovenia, as well. World music The 1970s Bratko Bibiƒç's band Begnagrad is considered one of the direct influences on modern world music. Bibiƒç's unique accordion style, often solo, with no accompaniment, has also made him a solo star. Punk rock Slovenia was the center for punk rock in the Titoist Yugoslavia. The most famous representatives of this genre were Pankrti, Niet, Lublanski Psi, ƒåao Piƒçke, Via Ofenziva, To≈æibabe, and Otroci Socializma. Techno and tech-house Slovenia has also produced two renowned DJs: DJ Umek and Valentino Kanzyani. Specialising in a frantic brand of party techno and tech-house, the pair co-founded the label Recycled Loops as well as having many releases on labels such as Novamute, Primate, Intec and Bassethound Records. Theatre Slovenia has a strong tradition of live theatre. Both professional and amateur theatre are financially supported by the government. Professional theatre in Slovenia runs in a repertory system; majority of professional theatres employ an ensemble of actors, and produce a season with four to twelve plays. The plays stay on repertory for minimum one season but often shows continue playing for a few years. There are four national theatres in Slovenia: Slovene National Theatre, Ljubljana and Maribor National Drama Theatre, Slovene National Opera in Ljubljana and Slovene National Theatre in Nova Gorica. In addition, there are another nationally funded repertory theatres Mestno Gledalisce Ljubljansko (City Theatre Ljubljana), Mladinsko Gledalisce Ljubljana, Presernovo gledalisce Kranj, Slovensko Ljudsko Gledalisce Celje, Mestno gledalisce Ptuj, Anton Podbevsek Teater Novo Mesto, Gledalisce Koper, Gledalisce Glej and Mini Teater. Lastly, Slovenia also has two national repertory theatres dedicated to producing puppetry; Lutkovno gledalisce Ljubljana and Lutkovno gledalisce Maribor. Independent, small producers are also active in Slovenia, including physical theatre (e.g. Betontanc), street theatre (e.g. Ana Monr√≥ Theatre), theatresports championship Impro League, and improvisational theatre (e.g. IGLU Theatre). = History = First theatrical performances in Slovenia date all the way back to the 18th century. Between 1715 and 1727 Passion procession play was performed in the town of Skofja Loka. However, the first play written and performed is Slovene language is Zupanova Micka by Anton Tomaz Linhart which premiered on 28 December 1789. The play was very influential in the formation of national cultural and linguistic identity. Slovenia at the time was not a sovereign country and Slovene not recognized as a language. Majority of literary works and business transactions were conducted in German language and Slovene playwriting as well as discussions regarding the nature of Slovene identity were closely connected with the formation of theatre. In 1879 a Dramatic Society was formed in Ljubljana as a formal attempt to professionalize and institutionalize theatre and playwriting in Slovenia. Between 1879 and 1941 there are several initiatives leading towards professionalization of Slovene theatre; first theatre venue is opened in Ljubljana before the end of 19.century and the Drama Society operates as a kind of three pronged organization under one umbrella. There is research and international dialogue forming a sort of institute like branch, there is an early drama school educating performers, and a repertory theatre with a year long full season. Between 1920 and 1941 the government tries to suppress the theatre, which springs back to life after 1941, when Slovenia joins Yugoslavia. In 1952 additional seven professional repertory theatres are founded by the national government and large municipalities who both provide longterm ongoing funding. Late 50's, 60's and 70's mark the time of a new wave of experimental, independent theatre is Slovenia. Visual arts, architecture and design The Sower (1907), by the Impressionist painter and musician Ivan Grohar, became a metaphor for the Slovenes and was a reflection of the transition from a rural to an urban culture. Slovenia's visual arts, architecture, and design are shaped by a number of architects, designers, painters, sculptors, photographers, graphics artists, as well as comics, illustration and conceptual artists. The most prestigious institutions exhibiting works of Slovene visual artists are the National Gallery of Slovenia and the Museum of Modern Art. =Architecture= Modern architecture in Slovenia was introduced by Max Fabiani, and in the mid-war period, Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik and Ivan Vurnik. In the second half of the 20th century, the national and universal style were merged by the architects Edvard Ravnikar and Marko Mu≈°iƒç. =Comics and animation= Milko Bambiƒç is known for the first Slovene comic strip Little Negro Bu-ci-bu, an allegory of Mussolini's career, and as the creator of the Three Hearts () brand, still used today by Radenska. After the WW II, both the comics and animated advertisements drawn by Miki Muster gained popularity in Slovenia. ;Animation The first Slovenian animated feature film was the 1998 Socialization of a Bull, made by Zvonko ƒåoh and Milan Eriƒç who together drew fifty thousand frames during the ten years of its making. The first entirely computer made animations are the 2003 Perkmandeljc and the 2008 ƒåikorja an' kafe, both made by Du≈°an Kastelic. =Conceptual art= A number of conceptual visual art groups formed, including OHO, Group 69, and IRWIN. Nowadays, the Slovene visual arts are diverse, based on tradition, reflect the influence of neighbouring nations and are intertwinned with modern European movements. =Design= The most known among Slovene interior designers is the designer of Scandinavian design-inspired 1952 Rex chair, Niko Kralj. His design is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art MOMA in New York City. Elan SCX are one of the best industrial design items that changed the world ski industry. They were designed in the internationally known Slovenian Elan company. Elan skis were depicted, even before Elan SCX, in the 1985 James Bond film series part A View to a Kill with Roger Moore. In the romantic comedy film Working Girl, Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) was depicted as skiing on the RC ELAN model skis and poles. =Graphics= During World War II, numerous graphics were created by Bo≈æidar Jakac, who helped establish the post-war Academy of Visual Arts in Ljubljana. =Illustration= In 1917 Hinko Smrekar illustrated the notable Fran Levstik's Martin Krpan book about the Slovene folk hero. The children's books illustrators include a number of women illustrators, such as Marlenka Stupica, Marija Lucija Stupica, Anƒçka Go≈°nik Godec, Marjanca Jemec Bo≈æiƒç, and Jelka Reichman. Many generations of children have been educated by the technical and science illustrations created by Bo≈æo Kos and published in Slovenian children's magazines, such as Ciciban. Recently, Lila Prap's illustrations gained popularity in Japan where children's cartoons based on her illustrations have been televised. =Painting= Historically, painting and sculpture in Slovenia was in the late 18th and the 19th century marked by Neoclassicism (Matev≈æ Langus), Biedermeier (Giuseppe Tominz) and Romanticism (Mihael Stroj). The first art exhibition in Slovenia was organised in the late 19th century by Ivana Kobilica, a woman-painter who worked in realistic tradition. Impressionist artists include Matej Sternen, Matija Jama, Rihard Jakopiƒç, Ivan Grohar whose The Sower (Slovene: Sejalec) was depicted on the ‚Ç¨0.05 Slovenian euro coins, and Franc Berneker, who introduced the impressionism to Slovenia. Espressionist painters include Veno Pilon and Tone Kralj whose picture book, reprinted thirteen times, is now the most recognisable image of the folk hero Martin Krpan. =Photography= The sculpture of the poet Valentin Vodnik (1758‚Äì1819) was created by Alojz Gangl in 1889 as part of Vodnik Monument, the first Slovene national monument. In 1841, Janez Puhar (1814‚Äì1864) invented a process for photography on glass, recognized on 17 June 1852 in Paris by the Acad√©mie Nationale Agricole, Manufacturi√®re et Commerciale. Gojmir Anton Kos was a notable realist painter and photographer between First World War and WW II. The first photographer from Slovenia whose work was published by National Geographic magazine is Arne HodaliƒçSlovenia River Excavation, National Geographic, January 2007. =Sculpture= The renewal of Slovene sculpture begun with Alojz Gangl (1859‚Äì1935) who made the first public monument of the notable Enlightenment figure Valentin Vodnik and provided The Genius of the Theatre and other statues for the Slovenian National Opera and Ballet Theatre building.Kiparstvo 19. in 20. stoletja , official website of the National Gallery of Slovenia References External links * Culture.si.

Previously, Garcia was director of football operations at the University of Miami, vice president of the Cleveland Browns, and associate athletic director at the University of Miami. Early life and education Born in 1961 in Havana, Cuba, Garcia moved to the United States with his family at age six under the Freedom Flights program.

In 2005, Garcia became senior associate athletic director at Miami. =FIU (2006‚Äìpresent)= Overview On October 10, 2006, Florida International University (FIU) named Garcia athletic director effective October 16. Six months before his contract was to expire, FIU signed Garcia to a new five-year contract on April 1, 2011 with a $16,000 raise and new title \\"Executive Director of Sports and Entertainment\\" replacing athletic director. During a period of national athletic conference realignment, Garcia later led FIU's move from the Sun Belt Conference to Conference USA effective July 1, 2013 following an announcement on May 4, 2012. Early in 2015, with a lack of winning seasons in football and men's basketball and only two conference championships since 2012 in any sport, FIU Alumni Association president Frank Pena called on FIU to fire Garcia. In September 2016, a booster bought a banner plane that flew over campus with a sign calling for Garcia to be fired, but FIU extended Garcia through 2018, after which Garcia planned to resign. However, in January 2018, The Miami Herald reported that Garcia was in talks for another contract extension. Football Just two days before he was to begin as FIU athletic director, Garcia encountered a crisis to manage, a brawl between the FIU and Miami football teams during their October 14, 2006 game in which 13 players were ejected. Garcia issued apologies on behalf of FIU and later suspended 16 FIU players who participated in the violence, in addition to dismissing two other players. Following the resignation of FIU's inaugural head coach Don Strock, Garcia made his first major coaching hire at FIU on December 19, 2006, Mario Cristobal as only the second head football coach in school history. With a 27‚Äì47 cumulative record from 2007 to 2012, Cristobal would become the most successful FIU football coach. In 2010 , Cristobal led FIU football to its first winning season with a 7‚Äì6 record, first Sun Belt Conference title, and first bowl win in the 2010 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl. The 2011 season had an 8‚Äì5 record and second straight bowl appearance. Following a 3‚Äì9 season in 2012, Garcia fired Cristobal, a decision criticized for its rashness. Ron Turner, the former San Jose State and Illinois head coach hired by Garcia to replace Cristobal, was not as successful, compiling a 10‚Äì30 overall record before being fired four games in the 2016 season. In November 2016, Garcia hired Butch Davis, his former boss at the University of Miami and Cleveland Browns, as FIU football head coach. Davis led FIU to an 8‚Äì5 record and Gasparilla Bowl appearance in 2017, for the first winning season and bowl appearance since 2011. Academic issues The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) reduced scholarships for FIU football, men's basketball, and baseball for the 2007‚Äì08 school year due to poor Academic Progress Rate scores from before Garcia's time as athletic director. A year later, the NCAA placed FIU on probation for four years through 2012 and further reduced scholarships in football and other sports due to multiple major violations of NCAA policies regarding academic eligibility and financial aid. An earlier version of this story was published as \\"FIU's athletic program placed on probation.\\" Having discovered the violations through an internal investigation, Garcia had ordered self-imposed scholarship reductions that the NCAA accepted.

Biography  Snow was born in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. Snow was taught about Mormonism from missionaries Orson Pratt and Lyman E. Johnson. He was baptized into the Church of Christ in 1832. On August 23, 1832, Snow and Amasa M. Lyman were ordained to the priesthood office of elder by Joseph Smith and Frederick G. Williams, and the two of them immediately departed on a proselytizing mission. In 1833, Snow returned to Vermont and married Susan Slater Lang. He remained in Vermont until 1834, when he went to Ohio to become a member of Smith's Zion's Camp expedition to Missouri. His wife Susan Slater Lang died in Ohio after delivering their only child, a daughter, Susan Lizette Snow born March 14, 1841 who was later the wife of Orson Pratt Jr. After the death of his wife Susan, Snow married Mary Augusta Hawkins on August 25, 1841. This wife bore to him the following children: Cora Georganna Snow (1843‚Äì1915), Adelaide Louisa Snow (1852‚Äì1919), Zerubbabel \\"Zera\\" Levi Snow (1854‚Äì1922), George Wellington Snow (1856‚Äì1938), Herbert Walderman Snow (1863‚Äì1938) and Marion Mason Snow (1856‚Äì1939). In 1856, Snow married Mary Lavina Sawyer (n√©e Stone) a widow who had a son named Walton O. Sawyer. Snow did not have children with this wife. In 1835, Snow was ordained to the priesthood office of seventy and became a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. Snow and his family migrated with the Latter Day Saints from Ohio, to Iowa, and finally to Utah Territory. In 1852 Snow was a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Virginia and Ohio. After serving as an Associate Justice of the Utah Territorial Supreme Court from 1850‚Äì54, Snow also served an LDS mission to Australia from June 1856 to December 1858. On February 19, 1869, Snow was elected as the Attorney General of the Territory of Utah. He died in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory.

British Speedway Who's Who. Hall moved from the Elite League team Peterborough Panthers at the end of the 2007 season to captain the Scunthorpe Scorpions in their first season in the Premier League in 2008. Career Born in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, Hall began his career with the Newcastle Diamonds, making his debut in the Premier League in 2001, before making his Conference League debut in 2002. Hall rode in the Premier League for Newcastle in 2002, recording an average of 1.52, but managed an average of 7.49 in the Conference League with the Newcastle Gems. Hall spent 2003 without a Premier League ride but he was ever present for Sheffield Tigers in the Conference League, averaging 8.46 a meeting. He also rode five matches for the Boston Barracudas in the Conference Trophy, and eight matches for the Coventry Bees in the British League Cup. His good form saw him earn a place in the Sheffield Tigers team for 2004, where he averaged 5.55 from 47 meetings. He averaged over five once again in 2005 but in a surprise move he was signed by the Peterborough Panthers for 2006 to ride in the Elite League. In 2006, Hall recorded a 4.54 average and the Panthers won the Elite League Championship with Hall playing a vital role in the second leg of the play-off final. He returned to the Panthers in 2007 but his season was cut short after receiving a fractured pelvis and broken ankle in the Garry Stead Benefit Meeting at Sheffield, a few days after being dropped by the Panthers. In 2008, Hall rode for the Scunthorpe Scorpions in the Premier League. He signed for Sheffield for the 2009 season. In 2011 he joined Leicester Lions as team captain, although he was released mid-season, rejoining Scunthorpe Scorpions. In 2012 he signed for the Sheffield Tigers. In 2014, Hall started the season with Redcar but received a 30-day ban for kicking Scunthorpe's Josh Auty, and was replaced by Poland's Rafal Konopka.

She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. SS Anthony F. Lucas‚Äîa Liberty ship‚Äîwas laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 2422) on 29 October 1943 at Houston, Texas, by the Todd- Houston Shipbuilding Corp.; acquired by the Navy under a bareboat charter on 2 November 1943; renamed Zaniah and classified as a cargo ship, AK-120, on 13 November; launched on 12 December; sponsored by Mrs. LeRoy Bembry; and accepted by the Navy and commissioned on 22 December 1943, for ferrying to the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company's yard at Mobile, Alabama, for conversion. Conversion to stores-barracks-distilling ship Arriving at Mobile on the day after Christmas, Zaniah soon entered dockyard hands and was decommissioned on 28 December. Meanwhile, during the conversion, the Navy broadened Zaniah's mission to that of a special stores-barracks-distilling ship and redesignated her AG-70 on 14 March 1944. Before she was completed, a distilling plant capable of producing 80,000 gallons of fresh water was installed in the ship; and she was commissioned on 2 September 1944, Lt. Comdr. Henry Mayfield, USNR, in command. World War II service Zaniah departed Mobile on 17 September, bound‚Äîvia Key West, Florida‚Äîfor Hampton Roads. Arriving at Key West on the 20th, the auxiliary vessel joined a coastwise convoy‚ÄîKN-339‚Äîpassing up the eastern seaboard from the 21st to the 24th, before steaming independently for Hampton Roads. Zaniah conducted her shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay before shifting to New York City. =Transfer to the Pacific Fleet= Getting underway again on 23 October, Zaniah sailed southward, transited the Panama Canal on 4 November, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 22d. Zaniah underwent further conversion at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard‚Äîreceiving additional office spaces and living quarters to accommodate the staff of a fleet service division. In addition, the ship's force joined yard workmen in installing a large electronics repair and supply department and additional water condensers to enable the ship to furnish fresh water to ships in forward areas of the South Pacific Ocean. =Repairing battle-damaged ships= Zaniah, thus outfitted for her special operations- departed Pearl Harbor on 10 January 1945 bound for Manus, in the Admiralties. Arriving on the 26th at Seeadler Harbor, she operated for a time with Sierra (AD-18) in repairing battle-damaged ships which put into Manus. Houston (CL-81) was among the warships which benefited from her services. =Supporting invasion forces at Philippine Islands= Zaniah soon shifted to the Solomons, providing water and repair services at Purvis Bay, Florida Island, from the day of her arrival, Washington's Birthday 1945. She returned to Manus on 19 March before sailing for Hollandia, New Guinea, to join a Philippine-bound convoy, GI-18, on the 29th. Zaniah arrived at San Pedro Bay, off Leyte, on 4 April and discharged her much-needed electronics and machinery parts before sailing for the Carolines. =Supporting repair efforts at Okinawa= The auxiliary ship operated at Ulithi from 13 to 24 April, providing repair services to ships damaged .during the conquest of the Ryukyus. Zaniah, herself, sailed for Okinawa on the 24th and arrived on 1 May‚Äîone month after the first landings on the embattled island. The first ship of her type in the area, she arrived at a critical time, as her commanding officer wrote: \\"when damage was at its height and repair facilities and personnel were scarce.\\" =Performing repair work under dangerous conditions= Zaniah's boats soon began a 24-hour schedule of transporting repairmen, in shifts, to damaged vessels. Initially, many men found themselves working 18-hour stints; and, despite daily air attacks and alerts, repair work progressed well. Salvage units from Zaniah cleared debris and made damaged hulls seaworthy until more permanent repairs could be made; others restored electrical plants and propulsion machinery; still others performed repairs on the vital and delicate radars and electronics installations on ships. Zaniah bore a charmed life‚Äîshe was never attacked by Japanese planes during her sojourn off Okinawa. On 22 June, two ships were struck nearby LST-534 and Ellyson (DMS-10) -- the closest that the vital auxiliary came to being attacked. =Rough weather = Zaniah shifted to Buckner Bay on 10 July and performed her services as a repair and water-distilling ship through the end of the war with Japan in mid-August. She suffered some damage in a typhoon which struck the Fleet's anchorage on 16 September, when Ocelot (IX-110) dragged her anchor in the tempest and brushed heavily against Zaniah, smashing a motor whaleboat and demolishing some bulwarks and stanchions on board the repair vessel. =End-of-war activity= That autumn, Zaniah later operated out of Tokyo Bay until sailing on 1 December for the United States. Arriving at Seattle, Washington, on Christmas Day, 1945, Zaniah shifted to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 11 March 1946. Records are unclear at this point but suggest that the ship may have participated in explosive tests in the 14th Naval District. Post-war decommissioning Decommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 29 April 1946, Zaniah was towed to the west coast; reached Suisun Bay, California, on 14 May 1947; and was turned over to the Maritime Commission the following day. She was struck from the Navy list on 22 May 1947 and was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet through the 1960s. In November 1972, Zaniah was towed to Seattle-Tacoma, Washington, and broken up for scrap. Military awards and honors Zaniah received one battle star for her World War II service.

He was born in Hertford, England, son of Charles Barkley.Barkley, Charles William, Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online His name is sometimes erroneously spelled Barclay due to the misspelling \\"Barclay Sound\\" (in what is now Vancouver Island, British Columbia) on early Admiralty charts, which arose from a mistake from Land District records. The misspelling originated in 1859 with the government agent William Eddy Banfield who issued certificates identifying the \\"Barclay Land District.\\" The name was corrected to Barkley Sound in 1904. (Banfield's own name was misspelled in the name of the town of Bamfield, also on Vancouver Island.) Biography =Early life= At the age of 11, Charles Barkley went to sea with his father, who was the commander of the East India Company ship Pacific. His father drowned in the Hooghly River, Calcutta, India while Charles was still a boy. Charles went on to sail to the West Indies in the merchantman Bestsy. He made seven voyages to the Far East for the East India Company and rose rapidly in the company's service. He was married in 1786, he soon after left the East India Company, taking what was apparently his first command, the 400-ton ship Loundon, ready for a trading voyage to the Pacific Northwest coast of North America. The ship, which was renamed Imperial Eagle and falsely registered as an Austrian in an attempt to avoid the cost of acquiring a trading licence from the East India Company, was owned by various supercargoes, including several East India Company directors in England, who together called themselves the Austrian East India Company. Daniel Beale organised the voyage of the Imperial Eagle when he returned to London from Canton on the HCS General Coote in August 1786.Louis Dermigny, La Chine et L'Occident, Paris, SEVPEN, 1964, tome III, p.1241. Beale had been the purser of, successively, the HC ships Walpole and General Coote on voyages between London and Canton in 1783‚Äì1786: in 1783 he joined the Canton partnership of John Henry Cox and John Reid in their mercantile ventures.Robert J. King, \\"John Meares: Dubliner, Naval Officer, Fur Trader and would be Colonizer\\", Journal of Australian Naval History, vol.8, no.1, March 2011, pp.32‚Äì62, n.34.King, \\"Meares\\" Beale's brother or cousin, John Beale, sailed in the Imperial Eagle as purser, but was killed in an affray with the natives on the North West Coast. Barkley was among the backers, subscribing ¬£3,000 to the venture. John Meares, who was also attempting to avoid license fees by falsely sailing under the Portuguese flag, was also one of the backers.BARKLEY, Frances, ABCBookWorld =Merchant career= Wynee, a Native of Owyhee, one of the Sandwich Islands, engraving by John Meares depicting the Hawaiian maidservant of the Barkley's. Barkley and his wife, Frances Barkley, left for the Pacific via Cape Horn on 24 November 1786. They stopped in the Hawaiian Islands where a maidservant named Wynee (Win√©e) was taken aboard. Wynee became the first Native Hawaiian, or \\"Kanaka\\", to reach British Columbia. From Hawaii, Barkley sailed the Imperial Eagle to Nootka Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, arriving in June 1787. At 400 tons, the Imperial Eagle was the largest ship to ever enter the main harbour of Friendly Cove in Nootka Sound. Barkley was surprised to find John Mackay, who had come to Nootka Sound with James Strange over a year before. Mackay had volunteered to remain at Nootka and work to establish relationships until Strange returned the next year. But Strange never returned. By the time Barkley arrived Mackay had learned the Nuu-chah-nulth's language and customs, adapted himself to their ways, and married a young native girl. At first Mackay was welcomed and befriended by Maquinna, but after unknowingly breaking a taboo he was exiled from Maquinna's house and forced to survive on his own. Barkley took Mackay on board Imperial Eagle. Mackay's experience helped Barkley gain an edge in the fur trade. Barkley stayed at Nootka Sound for about a month, acquired 700 prime sea otter skins, and many more of inferior quality. From Nootka he sailed south, trading, exploring, and naming various parts of the coast between Nootka Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, including Barkley Sound, Loudoun Channel, Cape Beale, and Imperial Eagle Channel. In honour of the indigenous chief Wickaninnish, Barkley gave the name Wickinninish Sound to what is now called Clayoquot Sound. He rediscovered the strait allegedly described by Juan de Fuca and named the strait as such on his chart. Barkley's Imperial Eagle was the first non-indigenous vessel to enter Neah Bay, in July 1787. John Meares, in the Feliz Aventureira, stopped at Neah Bay in June 1788, and Charles Duncan in did so in August 1788. Robert Gray, in the Lady Washington, entered Neah Bay in April 1789, and in July 1789 Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez did so in the Santa Gertrudis la Magna. Within the next few years a number of others visited Neah Bay and it became an important fur trading stop during the maritime fur trading era. After six members of his crew were killed by indigenous people, on 24 July 1787, near the mouth of the Hoh River,At the Far Reaches of Empire, p. 412n20 Barkley decided to set sail for Guangzhou (Canton), China, to sell his sea otter pelts. He arrived in Macau in December 1787. His trading venture resulted in a profit of ¬£10,000. Barkley gave the name Destruction River to what is now called the Hoh River, after his crew members were killed by the indigenous people. The name has since been transferred to nearby Destruction Island. The Native Hawaiian maidservant named Wynee (Win√©e) was left in China. Later she was found there by John Meares and sailed with him back to her homeland but she died of illness on 5 February 1788 during the voyage and her body was committed to the deep. He then left China and sailed with a cargo to Mauritius. While in Mauritius, Barkley learned that the East India Company was taking legal action against the owners of the Imperial Eagle for trading without a license. The owners, including John Meares, decided to avoid the legal problems by selling the Imperial Eagle and breaking their contract with Barkley. Charles and Frances Barkley stayed in Mauritius for over a year, where they had their first child. They then sailed to Kolkata (Calcutta), India, where the Imperial Eagle was confiscated. Barkley sued for damages and received ¬£5,000 for the loss of his ten-year contract. At the same time, John Meares gained possession of Barkley's nautical gear and his journal. Frances Barkley later wrote that Meares, \\"with the greatest effrontery, published and claimed the merit of my husband's discoveries therein contained, besides inventing lies of the most revolting nature tending to vilify the person he thus pilfered.\\" =Later years= After this series of events Charles and Frances Barkley found themselves stranded in Mauritius, without a ship and burdened with a newborn. Over the course of two years they managed to make their way to the Netherlands, then England. Frances was the first woman to sail around the world without deception. Only two women are known to have sailed around the world before Frances: Jeanne Bar√©, disguised as a man, and Rose de Freycinet, wife of Louis de Freycinet, as a stowaway. Barkley continued his merchant captain career. He commanded Princess Frederica, sailing in the Indian Ocean into 1791. Then he returned to the Pacific Northwest coast, in command of the 80-ton brig Halcyon. He traded for sea otter pelts in Sitka Sound, then sailed to the Hawaiian Islands, China, and Mauritius. In late November, 1792, Barkley's Halcyon met and briefly sailed with the maritime fur trading vessels Margaret, under James Magee, and Hope, under Joseph Ingraham. Little is known of his latter years. They were probably not prosperous. Upon his death at the age of 73 he left two sons and two daughters, and was survived by his wife Frances.

Baptisms and Burials From the Records of Christ Church, Philadelphia, 1709-1760. Philadelphia, PA, USA: Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, 1877-1893. ‚Äì February 1812) was an early American portrait painter. He was born in Philadelphia, the only child of James and Mary (Clark) Benbridge. When he was seven years old, his mother, who had been left a widow, was married to Thomas Gordon, a wealthy Scot. The boy's artistic talent was encouraged. He made decorative designs for his stepfather's drawing-room which were much admired. When he was fourteen years old he may have watched John Wollaston paint Gordon's portrait. It has been plausibly arguedHart, Charles Henry. \\"The Gordon Family, painted by Henry Benbridge,\\" Art in America, VI, 191-200. that young Benbridge had instruction from Wollaston, since his earliest known portrait, that of his half-sister Rebecca Gordon, \\"seems to hark back to Wollaston.\\" When he was 21, Benbridge was sent to Italy, where he studied with Pompeo Batoni and Anton Raphael Mengs. In 1769, on commission from James Boswell, biographer of Dr. Samuel Johnson, he made a portrait of Pasquale Paoli in Corsica which he took to London. It was exhibited (1769) at the Free Society of Artists, and from it three mezzotints were scraped and published with the artist's name signed \\"Bembridge.\\" Like other young Americans he was encouraged by Benjamin West. He wrote, on December 7, 1769, to his stepfather: \\"Upon my arrival I waited upon Mr. West who received me with a sort of brotherly affection, as did my cousin, Mrs. West.\\" Impelled, apparently, by a longing to rejoin his family, he left England in 1770, bearing from West the following note of recommendation to Francis Hopkinson: \\"By Mr. Benbridge you will receive these few lines. You will find him an Ingenous artist and an agreeable Companion. His merit in the art must procure him great incouragement and much esteem. I deare say it will give you great pleasure to have an ingenous artist resident amongst you.\\" In Philadelphia Benbridge married Hetty Sage and was admitted on January 18, 1771, to membership in the American Philosophical Society, of which Benjamin Franklin was a founder. He painted the large portrait of the Gordon family, with six figures, one of his masterpieces. Suffering, however, from asthma, he sought a more congenial climate and moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he succeeded Jeremiah Theus (d. May 18, 1774) as the popular portrait painter of South Carolina. There he made many likenesses of southern men and women, several of which have been popularly attributed to John Singleton Copley, an artist who never painted in the South and who left America in 1774. Around 1800 Benbridge settled in Norfolk, Virginia, whence he made frequent visits to his native city. At Norfolk he gave to Thomas Sully his first lessons in oil painting. He had previously instructed Thomas Coram of Charleston. Sully describes his master as \\"a portly man of good address-gentlemanly in his deportment.\\"Quoted in Dunlap, William. A History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States, vol. I, p. 167. Ed. F. W. Bayley and C. E. Goodspeed, 1918. Benbridge's health is said by Hart to have declined in middle age. Dunlap's assertion that his last years were passed \\"in obscurity and poverty\\" has been disputed. As a technician Benbridge drew well and painted solidly, exhibiting many characteristics of the late Italian masters. His contemporary Charles Fraser (quoted by Dunlap) said that \\"his shadows were dark and opaque and more suitable to the historical style.\\"Quoted by Dunlap. Hart says \\"Benbridge was impregnated by the brownish sameness of Batoni's palette and his shadows were too opaque, and although later he was somewhat emancipated from these errors, all his work belongs to the late Italian school.\\" His paintings, nevertheless, were notably good in respect of their black-and-white values and some of his miniatures are exquisite. His Italianate mode was much appreciated in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern states during his lifetime.

He passed studentexamen in V√§stervik in 1947 and then began his 27-year career in the Swedish Air Force as an officer cadet, flying the B√ºcker Bestmann, Harvard, Vampire, and P-51 Mustang, in that order. He was a flight engineer at the Swedish Air Force Flying School in 1953 and decided the same year that he was not suited to be an officer, and got himself into the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. In 1954 he was a flight engineer at Uppland Air Force Wing (F 16) (Flygvapnets Uppsalaskolor). After 4¬Ω years, he reentered the Swedish Air Force as an engineer officer, flying the Saab J 29A fighter, A 32A Lansen attack, and AJ 37 Viggen (also attack but primarily doing check flying after maintenance). Olausson was flight director 2nd degree and technical director at Skaraborg Air Force Wing (F 7) from 1960 and flight director 1st degree from 1963. His main job was as base technical officer, with general responsibility for all technical activities on the base (but not building and field maintenance), a diversified position. He was locally responsible for the introduction of the C-130 Hercules, starting with a technical four week course at Marietta in 1965. He logged only a few hours on the Hercules, but added about 30 minutes pilot time on the C-5 Galaxy. As a retired pilot and officer of Swedish C-130 F 7 Wing squadron service, his worldwide contacts allowed Olausson to construct a detailed history of every Hercules built, with upwards of 2,350 hulls accounted for. As the Hercules has seen worldwide service in the last fifty years, it pinpoints global hotspots by its use, and Olausson's efforts provide a source for operators' discrete records, from Air America and the CIA in Southeast Asia, up to the covert rendition aircraft of current day. It would appear that Lockheed Martin, the current producer of the C-130, finds the volume a useful reference, as they provide substantial new production information each year. The current edition runs 170 pages, the upper limit of international postal weight rates the author is willing to bear. Olausson's efforts have contributed a valuable resource to the Hercules community. Personal life In 1956, Olausson married Gudrun Christensen (born 1932), the daughter of the merchant S. Christensen and Margareta Svensson. He was the father of Anders (born 1958), Fredrik (born 1961), Ulla (1964) and Nina (born 1964). Olausson used to reside in S√•ten√§s and later in Gr√§storp.

He conducted important diplomatic negotiations in Constantinople, Rome and Beijing. His most lasting achievement was the Treaty of Kiakhta, which regulated relations between the Russian Empire and the Qing Empire until the mid-19th century. Also, he was an author of a whole number of pamphlets, monographs, treaties and letters concerned with liberating the lands of the Slavs, then occupied by the Ottoman Empire and the forces of Leopold I. Background Sava, named after Saint Sava, was born in 1669, in the village of Jasenik near Gacko, Bosnia Eyalet, Ottoman Empire. His father, Luka Vladislaviƒá, was a Serb landlord. The family was driven out from Gacko by the local Turks, and settled in the Republic of Ragusa. Having settled with his family in Ragusa (Dubrovnik), Luka enrolled Sava in the best schools there. The well-being of the citizens of Ragusa depended on maritime commerce; Sava Vladislavich was no exception. For higher education, Sava was sent abroad, first to the Republic of Venice to study Italian, Latin, philosophy, law, commerce and maritime science, then, to Spain and France where he took advanced courses in international law and commerce which became a great aid to his father's merchant business in Ragusa. Russian service A commercial project brought the young merchant to Constantinople, where, in the absence of a permanent Russian mission, he was entrusted with various tasks by the Russian foreign ministers Vasily Galitzine and Emelian Ukraintsev. It so happened that his own commercial interests always went hand-in-hand with those of the Russian government. In 1702, he made the acquaintance of Peter the Great in Azov. With an eye toward profiting from the fur trade with Russia, Vladislavich visited Moscow in the next year, but, after obtaining important privileges from the Tsar, returned to Constantinople, where he represented Russia's interests, in tandem with Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy, until the Battle of Poltava. It was he who purchased for the Tsar a black page, Ibrahim Hannibal, the ancestor of the great Pushkin. In 1708, he relocated to Moscow and soon received from the Tsar the lands in Little Russia, where Nezhin was made the centre of his commercial operations. The \\"Illyrian Count\\" (as Vladislavich liked to style himself) maintained trade contacts with fellow Serbs and was under the impression that they would rise in revolt against the Sultan as soon as the Tsar invaded the Danubian Principalities. Having launched the invasion in 1711, Peter sent him on a mission to Moldavia and Montenegro, whose population Vladislavich was expected to incite to rebellion. Little came of these plans, despite the assistance of a pro-Russian colonel, Michael Miloradovich (the ancestor of Mikhail Miloradovich). There has been preserved an inscription from that time, in a chronicle: From 1716 to 1722, Vladislavich resided in Italy, dividing his time between the advocacy of his own private interests and those of the Tsar. He entertained the aristocracy of Venice as well as foreign visitors, Ernest Louis, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt (1667-1739), Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (1654-1730), Girolamo Colloredo, Governor of the Duchy of Milan (then under Austrian rule), Prince Teodor Konstanty Lubomirski, Anselm Franz, 2nd Prince of Thurn and Taxis, and Count Charachin. Antonio Vivaldi dedicated La verit√† in cimento to Vladislavich in Venice in 1720. While in Italy, among other commissions, he supervised the education of Russian nobles (such as painter Ivan Nikitich Nikitin) and prepared important, secret political treaties with Pope Clement XI. It was he who acquired in Venice an assortment of marble statues that still decorate the Summer Garden in St. Petersburg. Treaty of Kyakhta In 1725, Vladislavich retraced the steps of Spathari's travels, leading a large Russian mission to negotiate a new treaty with the Qing Empire. The extended and fractious negotiations with the Qing Emperor and his officials resulted in the Treaty of Burya, which adopted the doctrine of Uti Possidetis Juris for delimiting the Russo-Chinese border. In 1728, these provisions were finalized in the Treaty of Kyakhta, which also incorporated Vladislavich's proposal on the construction of an Orthodox chapel in Beijing.Stephen Uhalley, Xiaoxin Wu. China and Christianity: Burdened Past, Hopeful Future. M.E. Sharpe, 2001. . Page 169. Viewing the commonly agreed border as an \\"everlasting demarcation line between the two empires\\",Quoted from: Peter C. Perdue. China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia. Harvard University Press, 2005. . Page 250. Vladislavich spared no effort to further trade and commerce on the border. He personally selected the location for the Russian trade factory of Kyakhta, where the district of Troitskosavsk commemorates his name. As a reward for his part in securing a favourable treaty with China and establishing the Tea Road between the two countries, he was invested with the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky. He also drafted a comprehensive project of financial reform and left a detailed description of the Qing Empire. In a secret memorandum (1731), Vladislavich cautioned the Russian government against ever going to war with China. Work In 1722, Sava Vladislavich published his most famous work, a translation in Russian of Mavro Orbin's Il regno de gli Slavi (1601; The Realm of the Slavs), which included a long passage on Kosovo. It was a tremendous sensation in Russia and the Balkans, and attracted the attention and discussion of all cultured society. It was said that \\"nowhere was there a rather large library that did not have a copy of Sava Vladislavich's translation of Orbini.\\"  Legacy  According to Serbian poet and diplomat Jovan Duƒçiƒá, descendant of Sava's either half- brother or first cousin Duka (whence the eponymic family name Duƒçiƒá), \\"Sava Vladislavich occupied a distinguished position among Russian diplomats in the eighteenth century. During two and a half decades, he took part in all important events of the Russian empire as a legate of the Czar (Peter the Great) and Czarina (Catherine I of Russia).\\" The fortress of Troitsko Savsk (see Kyakhta) was named after him at the time when he was negotiating a second treaty in 1727 between Russia and China.

This is usually brought about by change in temperature and the fungi are also described as thermally dimorphic fungi. An example is Talaromyces marneffei, a human pathogen that grows as a mold at room temperature, and as a yeast at human body temperature. The term dimorphic is commonly used for fungi that can grow both as yeast and filamentous cells, however many of these dimorphic fungi actually can grow in more than these two forms. Dimorphic is thus often used as a general reference for fungi being able to switch between yeast and filamentous cells, but not necessary limiting more shapes.  Ecology of dimorphic fungi  Several species of dimorphic fungi are important pathogens of humans and other animals, including Coccidioides immitis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Candida albicans, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Sporothrix schenckii, and Emmonsia sp. Some diseases caused by the fungi are: *sporotrichosis *blastomycosis *histoplasmosis *coccidioidomycosis *paracoccidioidomycosis *talaromycosis *candidiasis Many other fungi, including the plant pathogen Ustilago maydis and the cheesemaker's fungus Geotrichum candidum also have dimorphic life cycles.

He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1976 \\"for his development of the science and art of subsurface engineering, combining the contributions of the sciences of geology and soil mechanics with the practical art of foundation design\\"? Peck was born in Winnipeg to O.C. and Ethel Peck, and moved to the United States at age six. In 1934, he received his civil engineer degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and was given a three-year fellowship for graduate work in structures. On June 14, 1938, he married Marjorie Truby and obtained a Doctor of Civil Engineering degree. After receiving his degree, he worked briefly for the American Bridge Company, then on the Chicago Subway, but Peck spent the majority of his teaching career (33 years) at the University of Illinois, initially in structures but later focused on geotechnical engineering under the influence of Karl Terzaghi, ultimately retiring in 1975. He continued to work until 2006 and was highly influential as a consulting engineer, with some 1,046 consulting projects in foundations, ore storage facilities, tunnel projects, dams, and dikes, including the Cannelton and Uniontown lock and dam construction failures on the Ohio River, the dams in the James Bay project, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, the Dead Sea dikes and the Rion-Antirion Bridge in Greece. On May 8, 2009, the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute in Oslo, Norway, opened the Ralph B. Peck Library. This Library is next to the Karl Terzaghi Library, also at NGI. Correspondence between these two men are part of the two working libraries. The Karl Terzaghi Library tells about the birth and growth of soil mechanics. The Ralph B. Peck Library tells about the practice of foundation engineering, and how one engineer exercised his art and science for more than sixty years. Diaries from between 1940 and 1942 containing Peck's work with the Chicago Subway are included along with papers and reports on many of his subsequent jobs. During his career Peck authored over 201 publications, and served as president of the International Society of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering from 1970 to 1974. He received many awards, including: * 1945 The Norman Medal of the American Society of Civil Engineers * 1966 The Wellington prize of the ASCE * 1960 The Karl Terzaghi Award * 1976 The National Medal of Science, presented by President Gerald Ford * 1989 The John Fritz Medal In 2000, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) created the Ralph B.

It is also known for its sponsorship of a range of sporting events and teams. In 2019, a total of 7.5 billion cans of Red Bull were sold worldwide in over 171 countries. The headquarters of Red Bull GmbH are located in Fuschl am See, Austria. History Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz and Thai businessman Chaleo Yoovidhya founded Red Bull GmbH in 1984. While working for German manufacturer Blendax (later acquired by Procter & Gamble) in 1982, Mateschitz traveled to Thailand and met Chaleo, owner of TC Pharmaceutical. He found that the energy drink Krating Daeng, developed by Chaleo's company during the 1970s, helped to ease his jet lag. After seeing market potential in the drink, he partnered with Chaleo in bringing it to Europe. Under their agreement, the partners invested $500,000 each into founding Red Bull GmbH. In return, they would each receive a 49% stake in the company, with the remaining 2% stake going to Chaleo's son Chalerm. They also agreed that Mateschitz would run the company. Between 1984 and 1987, Red Bull GmbH modified the formula for Krating Daeng to better match European tastes by carbonating the beverage and making it less sweet. In 1987, the company introduced their adapted energy drink into Austria under the name Red Bull. It found huge success there by marketing to young professionals. The brand expanded throughout Europe during the early 1990s, exploding into the United States market during 1997, grabbing 75% of the market within a year. The wealth of Red Bull's founders grew with the company's success, and by March 2012, both Chaleo and Mateschitz had estimated net worths of over $5.3 billion each. Expanding its distribution to over 171 countries, the company sold 5.2 billion cans of Red Bull in 2012, making it the world's most-consumed energy drink.Red Bull company history, Red Bull GmbH corporate website Red Bull distribution The Red Bull company also distributes and markets a number of other drinks including Simply Cola, the Carpe Diem range of herbal soft beverages and the Sabai Wine Spritzer (the latter in association with the Thai Siam Winery in Thailand). In 2010 the company won a long-running legal battle with The Bulldog, a chain of cannabis coffee shops. The Bulldog was ordered to cease the sale and distribution of its own brand of energy drink. Azarius, accessed 13 February 2013 Marketing Kirby Chambliss racing in the Red Bull Air Race World Series Initially, Red Bull distributed free cases of the drink to college students in an attempt at viral advertising. This strategy was wildly successful, resulting in the rapid proliferation of sales. Red Bull has since become known for its sleek marketing targeted at young urban professionals through various sports and entertainment-based advertising campaigns. The current motto, \\"Red Bull Gives You Wings\\" is direct plays on the apparent stimulating properties of the beverage. =Sport sponsorship= Since the initial viral campaign, Red Bull's efforts have included sponsoring extreme sport events including cliff diving, BMX, skiing, flying, downhill and free-ride mountain biking and skateboarding. In the 1990s, Red Bull sponsored the rower Xeno M√ºller, who won an Olympic gold medal in the single sculls in 1996 . Red Bull also owns and conducts the Flugtag (\\"flight day\\" in German), a competition where entrants launch themselves off a 10-metre ramp in homemade \\"flying machines\\" into a body of water (reminiscent of the Birdman Rally); its own version of the soapbox derby called the Red Bull Soap Box Race which was recently held in Cincinnati, Ohio; the Red Bull Crashed ice, a world tour, in the winter extreme sporting event, ice cross downhill, which involves downhill skating in an urban environment, on a track which includes steep turns and high vertical drops. The Red Bull Art of the Can Competition, an international art competition in which artists are asked to create works using the Red Bull can; and the Red Bull BC One individual breakdance competition; also events such as the motorcycle Erzberg Enduro where less than two percent of entrants finish the course. World Rally Championship Red Bull Car Red Bull has had a sponsorship presence in a number of sports for some time, especially in the world of motor sport, and has a presence in the Australian V8 Supercars sponsoring the 888 race team, DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) especially the Abt Audi team, Dakar Rally sponsoring the KAMAZ Master, VW Race Touareg Team and Peugeot Sport, KTM's Factory teams in various motorcycle racing series, British Superbikes (BSB) Red Bull Honda and HM Plant Red Bull Honda teams, World Rally Championship with the Citro√´n, Volkswagen, M-Sport Ford and ≈†koda teams, the SEAT team in the World Touring Car Championship, in Champ Car with Neel Jani and PKV Racing, Rhys Millen's Pontiac in Formula D, sponsoring the GP2 Series team owned by Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner, Arden International. They previously sponsored and co-owned both the Sauber and Arrows Formula One teams, the Red Bull Cheever Racing Team in the IRL, and from 2007 to 2011 Team Red Bull competed in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Also Red Bull is now sponsoring the Cyberathlete Professional League and formerly sponsored its own air racing event called the Red Bull Air Race World Championship which contested its final season in 2019. The 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, a competition for driverless cars, was won by a student team from Stanford. The Team's robotically driven Volkswagen Touareg \\"Stanley\\", was sponsored by Red Bull. Red Bull sponsors the Red Bull Rope Masters competition with the National Double Dutch League for the Annual Holiday Classic at the Apollo Theatre in New York City, an event often dominated by teams from Japan featuring fusion double-Dutch (set to hip-hop or contemporary music), and they sponsor other regional events in Memphis, TN and at Morgan State University, to name a few.

Balls was educated at Norwich School, and at St John's College, Cambridge. After university, he applied for and was appointed to the new post of 'Cryptogamic Botanist' to the Khedivial Agricultural Society of Egypt in Cairo, which he took up in November 1904. He worked for the Society until 1910 when he was transferred to the newly founded Department of Agriculture of the Egyptian government as Botanist.My Spin Lab, p-67 Beginning in 1905 with of land, he was able to observe nine successive cotton crops in great detail, studying genetics, physiology and textile technology. In this period, he published 45 papers and the book, The Cotton Plant in Egypt, in which he summarised and added to his studies in genetics and physiology. The book became a botanical classic. Balls was elected a Fellow of St John's College in 1908. =1914 ‚Äì1927= Balls 'Some leading Cotton Breeding Scientists', 'William Lawrence Balls', CMG; CBE; CBE; FRS; ScD; DSc (Hons), FTI (Hons), 'FATHER OF COTTON TECHNOLOGY' (1882‚Äì1960) returned to England in 1914, where he settled in Cambridgeshire and wrote The development and properties of raw cotton (1915) and Egypt and the Egyptians (1915). He was invited to start an Experimental Department for the Fine Cotton Spinners' and Doublers' Association and, beginning with two rooms in Manchester and then a large house in Bollington, Cheshire three years later, he continued his studies of cotton fibre quality for the next ten years, mastering the art of cotton spinning and conducting research into cotton spinning technology. During this period, he became chairman for the Joint Standing Committee of the Board of Trade Committee, which grew into the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation, and the Shirley Institute of the British Cotton Industry Research Association. He became a member of the Textiles Institute, Manchester, in 1916 and published the book, Handbook of cotton spinning tests (1920). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1923. He resigned from his post with the Fine Cotton Spinners' and Doublers' Association at the end of 1925 to change his occupation. He returned to Cambridge and outlined his work of ten years in the book, Studies of quality in cotton (1928). The cotton quality reports published by Balls between 1912 and 1928 were to be cited by fibre physiologists and textile technologists for more than seventy years. =1927‚Äì1960= Soon afterwards, he was invited to return to Egypt as the head of all cotton work and was to remain there for the remainder of his working life. Personal research was limited but he was able to make great practical achievements using his administrative skills and to co-ordinate the work on cotton botany, agronomy and entomology. He studied the movement of water movement across all of the farm for more than 25 years and used this information when writing The yields of a crop (1953) after his retirement. He established the concept of pure-line seed supply and a plant for the actual spinning of small samples. He discovered that deliberate genetical selection could be done for yarn strength, which was the most important discovery made in cotton breeding at that time. He gave the annual Textile Institute 'Mather Lecture' in 1931 on aspects of Egyptian cotton. The lecture, Current Changes in Technology of Cotton Spinning and Cultivation, was published in The Journal of the Textile Institute XXII:5 (1931). Dr. Balls was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1934.

He was 'awarded honorary Doctorate', in 1953. Retirement He retired in 1947 and returned to Cambridgeshire, where he wrote his final book, The yield of a crop (1953), which defined the responsibility of the high water table for the decline in the Egyptian crop.

This agreement later included in the school by-laws that the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida be an ex officio member of the Board of Trustees. The School opened on September 21, 1962, with 122 boarding and day students from as far away as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and several states including Michigan, New York, and Ohio using the English system of Forms 1 (7th grade) through 6 (12th grade). The School served as the original full- time training camp and practice facility for the Miami Dolphins in the mid 1960s through 1969 and in 1968 served as the training facility to the Baltimore Colts for Super Bowl III. The campus and facilities also served as the filming location for the 1968 movie Paper Lion starring Alan Alda, Lauren Hutton, Roy Scheider, and Alex Karras adapted from the George Plimpton autobiographical pro football book of the same name. In 1977, the School served as camp HQ for the PGA National Academy of Golf that included exhibitions and instruction by Julius Boros and Andy North. In 2011, the Scots Summer Tennis camp included an exhibition by David Wheaton. The first group of girls as boarding students were admitted in 1972.The first girl to graduate was Teresa Vignau in 1969, the daughter of long-time French language teacher Pierre Vignau. Saint Andrew's School added a Lower School in 2000 and a Junior Kindergarten program in 2008. In 2010, the Saint Andrew's School began offering the International Baccalaureate Diploma program as an IB World School and in 2011, the school was accepted as a full international member of the Round Square Organization and was declared a \\"Green School of Excellence.\\" In 2013, Saint Andrew's School hosted the Round Square International Conference with over 750 educators and international students attending, including Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Over the last fifteen years, more than $30 million in new plant construction and renovation projects have been completed. The capital projects include a new Welcome Center, Stoops Family Gymnasium, Shapiro Family Adventure Gymnasium featuring a rock climbing wall and dance studio, a track and field facility, Moabery Early Years Learning Center, Andrews Hall ‚Äì The Center for Performing Arts, Malnik Family Athletic Center, and Schmidt Family Science Center. The school has also constructed a new Head of School residence and erected a replica of the original Chickee Chapel that had been built by the Miccosukee Seminole Indian tribe with which the early school had a close relationship. The idea for that chapel and several 'carports' of the same construction that dotted the campus in its early years was the brainchild of Father Raymond M. O'Brien, an original founding faculty member and the school's chaplain, Latin/Theology teacher, and Classical Language Department Head, as a continuing symbol of School heritage. The original alter front, a Seminole princess painted native nativity scene commissioned by Fr. O'Brien, now hangs on display in Saint Andrew's Chapel on campus. In 2012, SAS embarked on a new campus master plan. The inaugural project under this exciting plan is the Dr. Albert Cohen Family Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. This innovative facility opened in January 2018. Leadership Saint Andrew's School has had ten headmasters including The Rev. Hunter Wyatt-Brown Jr. (serving 1962‚Äì1963) and Eugene Curtis Jr. (serving 1964‚Äì1971). Dr. Ann Marie Krejcarek was the school's first female head of school (2007 -2012), replacing Rev. George E. Andrews II (serving 1989‚Äì2007). In 2013, Peter. B. Benedict II joined the Saint Andrew's community as its ninth headmaster. In July 2017, Ethan Shapiro arrived at Saint Andrew's School to serve as interim headmaster and named Head of School on January 1, 2019. The school has three chaplains, Rev. Dr. David Taylor, Rev. Charles Browning, and Rev. Faye Somers, who officiate at the chapel services, which are held once per week. Upper and Middle School chapel services are held in the Chapel of Saint Andrew (the Apostle), which is also home to an active parish under Rev.

Promotion The Discovery Institute promotes Explore Evolution as an alternative approach to mainstream teaching evolution to high school biology students: The Discovery Institute claims that the book Explore Evolution encourages critical thinking ‚Äì a claim challenged by the National Centre for Science Education: The Discovery Institute states that the textbook was \\"peer-reviewed\\" and claim that it was written by authors with impeccable credentials. This claim is refuted by the National Centre for Science Education, and the integrity of the peers is called into question: The Master of Arts Program in Science and Religion and the Department of Education of Los Angeles' evangelical Christian Biola University (formerly the Bible Institute of Los Angeles) presented a conference entitled Science Teacher Symposium ‚Äì Teaching Biological Origins on August 3 and 4 of 2007.Post details: Science Teacher Symposium - Teaching Biological Origins , Tom Magnuson, In the News ID and Current Events, Access Research Network, May 2, 2007.Science Teacher Symposium at Biola University August 3 - 4, 2007 , THE STAR TRIBUNE: A MONTHLY PUBLICATION OF STAR HOMESCHOOL COURSES, Biola Youth, Biola University, VOLUME NO. 9, ISSUE 10, June/July 2007.Science Teacher Symposium: Teaching Biological Origins, official announcement, Biola University website. A major thrust of this conference was to introduce and promote Explore Evolution as a textbook to teachers and others.Teaching Symposium, Day 1, Old Earth Creationism blog, August 3, 2007.Teaching Symposium, Day 2, Old Earth Creationism blog, August 4, 2007. Several public school and college courses used drafts of Explore Evolution in courses before its official publication date. There are plans to use Explore Evolution in a public school in Tacoma, Washington. In late 2009 the UK based creationist group \\"Truth in Science\\" sent out copies of the book to UK school librarians claiming that it was suitable for the UK science curriculum. In response the British Centre for Science Education published an open letter to UK school librarians\\"Open Letter to School Librarians\\" together with a leaflet called \\"Explore Evolution Exposed\\" \\"Explore Evolution Exposed\\" that was based on the NCSE analysis and adapted for the UK. Reaction Science writer Sally Lehrman wrote an editorial in The Boston Globe on August 9, 2007 in which she stated that Explore Evolution \\"claims to teach students critical thinking but instead uses pseudoscience to attack Darwin's theories.\\"Understanding Evolution is crucial to debate, Sally Lehrman, Boston Globe, August 9, 2007.

Meyer, Letters to the Editor, Boston Globe, August 16, 2007. University of Minnesota faculty member PZ Myers wrote a preliminary review after examining a copy of Explore Evolution. Myers had a negative impression of the book. Myers wrote, Myers feels that, \\"The biology part is shallow, useless, and often wrong, and the critiques are basically just warmed over creationist arguments.\\" Myers also points out that Explore Evolution is only 150 pagesThe official length of Explore Evolution is 160 pages, and includes 120 illustrations/images. which compares unfavorably with the 1,146 pages of Kenneth Miller and Joseph S. Levine's popular high school textbook, Biology: The Living Science.Biology: The Living Science, Kenneth R. Miller and Joseph S. Levine, Pearson Prentice Hall, 2000, . National Center for Science Education Public Information Project Director Nick Matzke suggests that Explore Evolution is a major signal at the vanguard of the fourth stage of the creationism‚Äìevolution controversy: *Round 1: Fundamentalists ban evolution (1920s-1960s). Epperson v. Arkansas (1968) concluded this round. *Round 2: \\"Creation science\\", which was invented in 1969, and ended as a serious legal strategy by Edwards v. Aguillard (1987), although there were earlier defeats such as Hendren v. Campbell (1977) and McLean v. Arkansas (1982). *Round 3: Intelligent design, invented about 1987, ended as a serious legal strategy by Kitzmiller v. Dover (2005). *Round 4: Attack evolution and imply creationism and/or intelligent design without making explicit statements. This is the strategy used in Explore Evolution in 2007.Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you... , Nick Matzke, Panda's Thumb, Entry 3238, July 13, 2007. That the book's strategy has been formulated in an attempt to avoid repeating previous court defeats is acknowledged by the Discovery Institute: This is consistent with the Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns, \\"Stand up for science\\" and \\"Critical Analysis of Evolution\\". Matzke also notes that there is little that is new in the book or its associated teaching materials. John Calvert, managing director of IDnet, believes that although Explore Evolution is \\"enormously important\\" for the creationist movement, he is skeptical about its chances for success. Since 2005, IDnet has tried to bring what they call \\"critical analysis of evolution\\" into the classroom. However, a setback in Kansas in February 2007 to change science standards in the wake of the Kitzmiller v. Dover decision left Calvert pessimistic. John Timmer of technology site Ars Technica also reviewed the book, writing that its version of inquiry-based learning (IBL) \\"assiduously avoids suggesting that any conclusion can be reached at all\\", and as such it \\"makes a mockery of the use of IBL in the sciences\\", making the analogy that teaching gravity in this manner would lead students to the conclusion that \\"the force of gravity is random or unmeasurable\\". He also summarises the book's use of classic creationist arguments, noting that the book maintains \\"plausible deniability\\" by not explicitly mentioning either creationism or intelligent design. He also criticises the book for \\"logical inconsistencies\\" in its argument and its \\"divide and conquer\\" approach to the lines of evidence for evolution, particularly the idea \\"that the fact that any one of them supports evolution was just a lucky fluke\\". Ultimately he surmised that the book \\"doesn't only promote stupidity, it demands it\\" and \\"will leave their students with a picture of modern biology that is essentially unrelated to the way that science is actually practiced\\".

Biography Born in Albany, New York, where his father, educated as a civil engineer, worked in the family candy business. Chestnut was raised in the 1920s and went on a scholarship to MIT in 1934 to study chemical engineering. In the first year he was awarded for his outstanding performance in chemistry, but switched anyway to electrical engineering and became co-op student. After five years of study he received a combined B.S. and M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1940.Archives:Conversations with the Elders - Harold Chestnut at ieeeghn.org/wiki, 2012 Chestnut received further on-the-job training in General Electric's Advanced Engineering Program (AEP). Later in his career he received two honorary doctorates in engineering in 1966 from Case Institute of Technology in 1972 from Villanova University. In 1940 Chestnut began a lifelong career with the General Electric, which would last until his retirement in 1983. He married his wife Erma Ruth Callaway Chestnut in 1944 and they had three sons. During the Second World War Chestnut was both a student and an instructor in General Electric's well-known Advanced Engineering Program. He worked on the design of the central fire- control system and remotely controlled gun turrets used on the B-29 aircraft.In memoriam‚ÄîHarold Chestnut IEEE the current source, Vol 28, no 1, April 2002. Later he worked in the Aeronautics and Ordnance Department and the Systems Engineering and Analysis branch of the Advanced Technology Laboratory, where he served as manager from 1956 to 1972. Here he worked on a wide variety of technical problems including reliability issues in rapid transit and the Apollo mission to the moon.Stephen Kahne, Harold Chestnut, First IFAC President, in: Automatica, June 2002, Volume 38, No. 6. Later in his career he returned to the field of electric power. This time the focus was power systems automation. From 1957 to 1959 he was the first president of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC). After his term as president, he chaired the technical board from 1961 to 1966 and the Systems Engineering technical committee for another three years. He served as honorary editor from 1969 to 1972 and was the first adviser appointed for life in 1984. Chestnut was also involved in the IEEE since its establishment in 1963 and served as president in 1973. He was active in the formation of the IEEE History Center and the International Federation of Automatic Control. In 1961 Chestnut edited Automatica: The International Journal on Automatic Control and Automation. He also became editor of a John Wiley book series on systems engineering and analysis. In this series Chestnut published his own books. In the 1980s and 1990s, after retirement, he created the \\"Supplemental Ways of Improving International Stability (SWIIS) Foundation\\" to identify and implement \\"supplemental ways to improve international stability\\". He devoted those years to this effort, in which he applied principles from the control field, such as stability and feedback, to international political realities. Harold Chestnut received many awards: In 1966 he received an Honorary Doctorate in engineering from Case Western Reserve University and in 1972 from Villanova University. In 1984 he won the IEEE Centennial Medal and in 1985 the AACC's Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award. In 1981 he received the prestigious Honda Prize for ecotechnology, which included a substantial financial award from the Japan‚Äôs Honda Foundation.Hondaprize 1980 . Dr. Harold Chestnut was awarded \\"For his achievements associated with the promotion of humanitarian use of technology as a world leader in systems engineering that encompasses electrical, electronic, instrumentation, and automatic control.\\" He was also named a Fellow of the AIEE, ISA, and AAAS. He was elected to the US National Academy of Engineering in 1974 and selected as a Case Centennial Scholar in 1980. In 1998 Harold Chestnut and the Chestnut Family provided a gift to IFAC for the IFAC Textbook Prize.

In the 1937 London production, it was sung by Gina Malo and Eddie Pola. The song was performed in the 1954 Broadway revival by Kay Coulter and Joshua Shelley. The Mamas and the Papas Originally recorded for an appearance on \\"Rodgers and Hart Today\\", an episode of ABC Stage 67, the Mamas and the Papas' version of the song was released as a single at the end of 1967, reaching #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was issued to keep the group in the charts while awaiting the completion of the group's fourth album, The Papas & The Mamas. However, the song does not appear on that album; it was instead used to promote the group's second greatest-hits package, entitled Golden Era Vol. 2. It is the last of the Mamas & the Papas' singles produced in a professional studio; subsequent singles were recorded in John and Michelle Phillips' home studio. The mono single differs slightly from the stereo album mix, as was common for the group's singles, in that a few additional words are sung during the first chorus in the stereo mix.

Born in London to musical parents, Cunningham studied piano with his mother, subsequently switching to organ at the Guildhall School of Music. Upon graduation he studied with Josiah Booth at Park Chapel, Crouch End, North London. From there he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Music, where he became an FRCO at age eighteen and organist of the Alexandra Palace at twenty-two, in 1901. After 1900 Cunningham's fame as a recitalist steadily grew. However, during the armistice celebrations of 1918 the instrument at Alexandra Palace was wantonly wrecked, and was not restored and re-opened again until December 1929. From 1920 to 1924 he was organist of St Alban's Church, Holborn. In 1924 Cunningham was appointed Birmingham City Organist and Birmingham University Organist. He was conductor of the City of Birmingham Choir for many years. He also played often at the Town Hall of the same city. In September 1930 he made recordings on the restored Alexandra Palace organ. Cunningham's most important students were E. Power Biggs, George Thalben-Ball, who succeeded him at Birmingham in 1949, Fela Sowande, and Michael (Stockwin) Howard, Geraint Jones and Arnold Richardson. Cunningham died in Birmingham, aged 69.

The cathedral is the ecclesiastical seat of the Bishop of Ajaccio, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Marseille. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and is in the Baroque/Mannerist architectural style. History The present cathedral was built between 1577 and 1593 and is attributed to Italian architect Giacomo della Porta. It was built to replace the former Cathedral of Saint-Croix, destroyed in 1553 in order to make room for developments in the city's defenses, as stated in the permit required by the Council of Ancients in 1559 to the Senate of Genoa and Pope Gregory XIII in order to build a new cathedral. The final stone was laid in 1593 by Jules Guistiniani, made bishop by Pope Sixtus V.Cathedral - Ajaccio It is where Napoleon Bonaparte was baptised on 21 July 1771Ajaccio Official website: Monuments et architectures and he recited the following on his deathbed in Saint Helena in 1821: \\"If they forbid my corpse, as they have forbidden my body, deny me a small piece of land in which to be buried, I wish to be buried with my ancestors in Ajaccio Cathedral in Corsica.\\"http://www.easyvoyage.co.uk/france/ajaccio-cathedral-4872 The cathedral has been a monument historique (a national heritage site of France) since 30 October 1906. According to legend, on 15 August 1769, Letizia Buonaparte felt sudden labour pains while in the cathedral. She rushed home to the Buonaparte's home, just steps away, and gave birth to Napoleon on a first floor sofa before she could reach her bedroom upstairs.Finding Napoleon: Ajaccio Cathedral Architecture = Exterior = Ajaccio Cathedral is built in the style of the Counter-Reformation with an ocher Baroque fa√ßade. = Interior = Inside view of the nave and of the choir The present cathedral is smaller than its predecessor. The interior's Latin cross is delineated by the shallow and modestly-sized transept, which is covered by a dome. The central nave is very high and wide itself, but is short in length compared to the rest of the building. It is covered with barrel vault arches reminiscent of the Renaissance era. The building also has two aisles that depart from the front door and go up to the transept, separated in the middle by the seven chapels beside two rows of three columns. Entering on the right is the marble baptismal font. It is a simple bowl engraved with Giustiniani's coat of arms, surmounted by a Tuscan bronze crown, below which there is a gold inscription, Heic baptisatus Magnus Imperator (Latin for Here is baptised the Great Emperor). The altar is in polychrome marble, and it was originally located at the Church of the Suffragio in Lucca but was given to the cathedral by Elisa Bonaparte, Napoleon's sister in 1809. It has an altarpiece composed of four twisted columns of black marble from Porto Venere. The Corinthian orders have a double pedestal with a collection of marble. The tabernacle dates from the time of the construction of the cathedral and originally stood at the baptismal font. It was then placed at the high altar and stands out for its unorthodox style. Ajaccio Cathedral has seven side chapels, but the following three are the most prominent: * The Chapel of Our Lady of Mercy (French: Chapelle de la Vierge de la Mis√©ricorde) is a 1752 chapel in honor of the Virgin of Mercy is dedicated to the patron saint of Ajaccio, the Virgin Mary. It has a marble altar designed by Geonese sculptors decorated with spiral Brocatello marble from Spain. * The Chapel of Our Lady of the Rosary (French: Chapelle de Notre-Dame du Rosaire) is a 1765 chapel that houses a stucco altar and series of boxes representing the Glorious, Joyful, Luminous and Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary of the Virgin, a central niche with the statue of the Virgin Mary and two side niches containing statues of Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Siena. * The Chapel of the Madonna of Pianto (French: Chapelle de la Madonna de Pianto) is a small 18th-century chapel that contains many murals by Domenico Tintoretto and Eug√®ne Delacroix's The Triumph of Religion. The cathedral also houses a large pipe organ built in 1849 by Aristide Cavaill√©- Coll and later restored and electrified by Jo√´l P√©trique.

Symptoms may vary from none, to mild, to meningitis. Infection with Angiostrongylus cantonensis (rat lungworm) can occur after voluntarily or inadvertently consuming raw Giant African land snails, great grey slugs, or other mollusks and even unwashed fruits and vegetables. In humans, Angiostrongylus is the most common cause of eosinophilic meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Frequently the infection will resolve without treatment or serious consequences, but in cases with a heavy load of parasites the infection can be so severe it can cause permanent damage to the central nervous system or death.David, John T. and Petri, William A Jr. Markell and Voge‚Äôs Medical Parasitology. St. Louis, MO: El Sevier, 2006. Symptoms Infection first presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weakness, which gradually lessens and progresses to fever, and then to central nervous system (CNS) symptoms and severe headache and stiffness of the neck. =CNS infection= CNS symptoms begin with mild cognitive impairment and slowed reactions, and in a very severe form often progress to unconsciousness. Patients may present with neuropathic pain early in the infection. Eventually, severe infection will lead to ascending weakness, quadriparesis, areflexia, respiratory failure, and muscle atrophy, and will lead to death if not treated. Occasionally patients present with cranial nerve palsies, usually in nerves 7 and 8, and rarely larvae will enter ocular structures. Even with treatment, damage to the CNS may be permanent and result in a variety of negative outcomes depending on the location of the infection, and the patient may suffer chronic pain as a result of infection. =Eye invasion= Symptoms of eye invasion include visual impairment, pain, keratitis, and retinal edema. Worms usually appear in the anterior chamber and vitreous and can sometimes be removed surgically. =Incubation period= The incubation period in humans is usually from 1 week to 1 month after infection, and can be as long as 47 days. This interval varies, since humans are intermediate hosts and the life cycle does not continue predictably as it would in a rat. Cause =Transmission= Transmission of the parasite is usually from eating raw or undercooked snails or other vectors. Infection is also frequent from ingestion of contaminated water or unwashed salad that may contain small snails and slugs, or have been contaminated by them. =Reservoirs= Rats are the definitive host and the main reservoir for A. cantonensis, though other small mammals may also become infected. While angiostrongylus can infect humans, humans do not act as reservoirs since the worm cannot reproduce in humans and therefore humans cannot contribute to their life cycle. =Vectors= A. cantonensis has many vectors, with the most common being several species of snails, including the giant African land snail (Achatina fulica) in the Pacific islands and snails of the genus Pila in Thailand and Malaysia. The golden apple snail, A. canaliculatus, is the most important vector in areas of China. Freshwater prawns, crabs, or other paratenic, or transport, hosts can also act as vectors. =Organism= Morphology A. cantonensis is a nematode roundworm with 3 outer protective collagen layers, and a simple stomal opening or mouth with no lips or buccal cavity leading to a fully developed gastrointestinal tract. Males have a small copulatory bursa at the posterior. Females have a ‚Äúbarber pole‚Äù shape down the middle of the body, which is created by the twisting together of the intestine and uterine tubules. The worms are long and slender - males are 15.9‚Äì19 mm in length, and females are 21‚Äì25 mm in length. Life cycle The adult form of A. cantonensis resides in the pulmonary arteries of rodents, where it reproduces. After the eggs hatch in the arteries, larvae migrate up the pharynx and are then swallowed again by the rodent and passed in the stool. These first stage larvae then penetrate or are swallowed by snail intermediate hosts, where they transform into second stage larvae and then into third stage infective larvae. Humans and rats acquire the infection when they ingest contaminated snails or paratenic (transport) hosts including prawns, crabs, and frogs, or raw vegetables containing material from these intermediate and paratenic hosts. After passing through the gastrointestinal tract, the worms enter circulation. In rats, the larvae then migrate to the meninges and develop for about a month before migrating to the pulmonary arteries, where they fully develop into adults. Humans are incidental hosts; the larvae cannot reproduce in humans and therefore humans do not contribute to the A. cantonensis life cycle. In humans, the circulating larvae migrate to the meninges, but do not move on to the lungs. Sometimes the larvae will develop into the adult form in the brain and CSF, but they quickly die, inciting the inflammatory reaction that causes symptoms of infection. Diagnosis Diagnosis of Angiostrongyliasis is complicated due to the difficulty of presenting the angiostrongylus larvae themselves, and will usually be made based on the presence of eosinophilic meningitis and history of exposure to snail hosts. Eosinophilic meningitis is generally characterized as a meningitis with >10 eosinophils/ŒºL in the CSF or at least 10% eosinophils in the total CSF leukocyte count. Occasionally worms found in the cerebrospinal fluid or surgically removed from the eye can be identified in order to diagnose Angiostrongyliasis. =Lumbar puncture= Lumbar puncture should always be done in cases of suspected meningitis. In cases of eosinophilc meningitis it will rarely produce worms even when they are present in the CSF, because they tend to cling to the end of nerves. Larvae are present in the CSF in only 1.9-10% of cases. However, as a case of eosinophilic meningitis progresses, intracranial pressure and eosinophil counts should rise. Increased levels of eosinophils in the CSF is a hallmark of the eosinophilic meningitis. =Brain imaging= Brain lesions, with invasion of both gray and white matter, can be seen on a CT or MRI. However MRI findings tend to be inconclusive, and usually include nonspecific lesions and ventricular enlargement. Sometimes a hemorrhage, probably produced by migrating worms, is present and of diagnostic value. =Serology= In patients with elevated eosinophils, serology can be used to confirm a diagnosis of Angiostrongylias rather than infection with another parasite. There are a number of immunoassays that can aid in diagnosis, however serologic testing is available in few labs in the endemic area, and is frequently too non-specific. Some cross reactivity has been reported between A. cantonensis and trichinosis, making diagnosis less specific. The most definitive diagnosis always arises from the identification of larvae found in the CSF or eye, however due to this rarity a clinical diagnosis based on the above tests is most likely. Prevention There are public health strategies that can limit the transmission of A. cantonensis by limiting contact with infected vectors. Vector control may be possible, but has not been very successful in the past. Education to prevent the introduction of rats or snail vectors outside endemic areas is important to limit the spread of the disease. There are no vaccines in development for angiostrongyliasis. =Recommendations for individuals= To avoid infection when in endemic areas, travelers should: *Avoid consumption of uncooked vectors, such as snails and freshwater prawns *Avoid drinking water from open sources, which may have been contaminated by vectors *Prevent young children from playing with or eating live snails Treatment Treatment of angiostrongyliasis is not well defined, but most strategies include a combination of anti-parasitics to kill the worms, steroids to limit inflammation as the worms die, and pain medication to manage the symptoms of meningitis. =Anthelmintics= Anthelmintics are often used to kill off the worms, however in some cases this may cause patients to worsen due to toxins released by the dying worms. Albendazole, ivermectin, mebendazole, and pyrantel are all commonly used, though albendazole is usually the drug of choice. Studies have shown that anthelmintic drugs may shorten the course of the disease and relieve symptoms. Therefore, anthelmintics are generally recommended, but should be administered gradually so as to limit the inflammatory reaction. =Anti-inflammatories= Anthelmintics should generally be paired with corticosteroids in severe infections to limit the inflammatory reaction to the dying parasites. Studies suggest that a two-week regimen of a combination of mebendazole and prednisolone significantly shortened the course of the disease and length of associated headaches without observed harmful side effects. Other studies suggest that albendazole may be more favorable, because it may be less like to incite an inflammatory reaction. The Chinese herbal medicine long-dan-xie-gan- tan (LDGXT) has also been shown to have a similar anti inflammatory effect, and in mild cases may be used alone to relieve symptoms while infection resolves itself. =Symptomatic treatment= Symptomatic treatment is indicated for symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and in some cases, chronic pain due to nerve damage or muscle atrophy. Epidemiology A. cantonensis and its vectors are endemic to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Basin. The infection is becoming increasingly important as globalization allows it to spread to more and more locations, and as more travelers encounter the parasites. The parasites probably travel effectively through rats traveling as stowaways on ships, and through the introduction of snail vectors outside endemic areas. Although mostly found in Asia and the Pacific where asymptomatic infection can be as high as 88%, human cases have been reported in the Caribbean, where as much as 25% of the population may be infected. In the United States, cases have been reported in Hawaii, which is in the endemic area. The infection is now endemic in wildlife and a few human cases have also been reported in areas where the parasite was not originally endemic, such as New Orleans and Egypt. The disease has also arrived in Brazil, where there were 34 confirmed cases from 2006 to 2014, including one death. The giant African land snail, which can be a vector of the parasite, has been introduced to Brazil as an invasive species and is spreading the disease. There may be more undiagnosed cases, as Brazilian physicians are not familiar with the eosinophilic meningitis associated to angiostrongyliasis and misdiagnose it as bacterial or viral. The parasite is rarely seen outside of endemic areas, and in these cases patients generally have a history of travel to an endemic area.

The term is sometimes used in a narrow sense, such as when describing the loss of particular alleles or genes, as well as being used more broadly, as when referring to the loss of a phenotype or whole species. Genetic erosion occurs because each individual organism has many unique genes which get lost when it dies without getting a chance to breed. Low genetic diversity in a population of wild animals and plants leads to a further diminishing gene pool ‚Äì inbreeding and a weakening immune system can then \\"fast-track\\" that species towards eventual extinction. By definition, endangered species suffer varying degrees of genetic erosion. Many species benefit from a human-assisted breeding program to keep their population viable, thereby avoiding extinction over long time-frames. Small populations are more susceptible to genetic erosion than larger populations. Genetic erosion gets compounded and accelerated by habitat loss and habitat fragmentation ‚Äì many endangered species are threatened by habitat loss and (fragmentation) habitat. Fragmented habitat create barriers in gene flow between populations. The gene pool of a species or a population is the complete set of unique alleles that would be found by inspecting the genetic material of every living member of that species or population. A large gene pool indicates extensive genetic diversity, which is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense selection. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see inbreeding and population bottlenecks) can cause reduced biological fitness and increase the chance of extinction of that species or population. Processes and consequences Population bottlenecks create shrinking gene pools, which leave fewer and fewer fertile mating partners. The genetic implications can be illustrated by considering the analogy of a high-stakes poker game with a crooked dealer. Consider that the game begins with a 52-card deck (representing high genetic diversity). Reduction of the number of breeding pairs with unique genes resembles the situation where the dealer deals only the same five cards over and over, producing only a few limited \\"hands\\". As specimens begin to inbreed, both physical and reproductive congenital effects and defects appear more often. Abnormal sperm increases, infertility rises, and birthrates decline. \\"Most perilous are the effects on the immune defense systems, which become weakened and less and less able to fight off an increasing number of bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, and other disease-producing threats. Thus, even if an endangered species in a bottleneck can withstand whatever human development may be eating away at its habitat, it still faces the threat of an epidemic that could be fatal to the entire population.\\" Loss of agricultural and livestock biodiversity Genetic erosion in agricultural and livestock is the loss of biological genetic diversity ‚Äì including the loss of individual genes, and the loss of particular recombinants of genes (or gene complexes) ‚Äì such as those manifested in locally adapted landraces of domesticated animals or plants that have become adapted to the natural environment in which they originated. The major driving forces behind genetic erosion in crops are variety replacement, land clearing, overexploitation of species, population pressure, environmental degradation, overgrazing, governmental policy, and changing agricultural systems. The main factor, however, is the replacement of local varieties of domestic plants and animals by other varieties or species that are non-local. A large number of varieties can also often be dramatically reduced when commercial varieties are introduced into traditional farming systems. Many researchers believe that the main problem related to agro- ecosystem management is the general tendency towards genetic and ecological uniformity imposed by the development of modern agriculture. In the case of Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, major causes of genetic erosion are reported to include indiscriminate cross-breeding, increased use of exotic breeds, weak policies and institutions in animal genetic resources management, neglect of certain breeds because of a lack of profitability or competitiveness, the intensification of production systems, the effects of diseases and disease management, loss of pastures or other elements of the production environment, and poor control of inbreeding. Prevention by human intervention, modern science and safeguards =In situ conservation= With advances in modern bioscience, several techniques and safeguards have emerged to check the relentless advance of genetic erosion and the resulting acceleration of endangered species towards eventual extinction. However, many of these techniques and safeguards are too expensive yet to be practical, and so the best way to protect species is to protect their habitat and to let them live in it as naturally as possible. Wildlife sanctuaries and national parks have been created to preserve entire ecosystems with all the web of species native to the area. Wildlife corridors are created to join fragmented habitats (see Habitat fragmentation) to enable endangered species to travel, meet, and breed with others of their kind. Scientific conservation and modern wildlife management techniques, with the expertise of scientifically trained staff, help manage these protected ecosystems and the wildlife found in them. Wild animals are also translocated and reintroduced to other locations physically when fragmented wildlife habitats are too far and isolated to be able to link together via a wildlife corridor, or when local extinctions have already occurred. =Ex situ conservation= Modern policies of zoo associations and zoos around the world have begun putting dramatically increased emphasis on keeping and breeding wild-sourced species and subspecies of animals in their registered endangered species breeding programs. These specimens are intended to have a chance to be reintroduced and survive back in the wild. The main objectives of zoos today have changed, and greater resources are being invested in breeding species and subspecies for then ultimate purpose of assisting conservation efforts in the wild. Zoos do this by maintaining extremely detailed scientific breeding records (i.e. studbooks)) and by loaning their wild animals to other zoos around the country (and often globally) for breeding, to safeguard against inbreeding by attempting to maximize genetic diversity however possible. Costly (and sometimes controversial) ex-situ conservation techniques aim to increase the genetic biodiversity on our planet, as well as the diversity in local gene pools. by guarding against genetic erosion. Modern concepts like seedbanks, sperm banks, and tissue banks have become much more commonplace and valuable. Sperm, eggs, and embryos can now be frozen and kept in banks, which are sometimes called \\"Modern Noah's Arks\\" or \\"Frozen Zoos\\". Cryopreservation techniques are used to freeze these living materials and keep them alive in perpetuity by storing them submerged in liquid nitrogen tanks at very low temperatures. Thus, preserved materials can then be used for artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, embryo transfer, and cloning methodologies to protect diversity in the gene pool of critically endangered species. It can be possible to save an endangered species from extinction by preserving only parts of specimens, such as tissues, sperm, eggs, etc. ‚Äì even after the death of a critically endangered animal, or collected from one found freshly dead, in captivity or from the wild. A new specimen can then be \\"resurrected\\" with the help of cloning, so as to give it another chance to breed its genes into the living population of the respective threatened species. Resurrection of dead critically endangered wildlife specimens with the help of cloning is still being perfected, and is still too expensive to be practical, but with time and further advancements in science and methodology it may well become a routine procedure not to far into the future. Recently, strategies for finding an integrated approach to in situ and ex situ conservation techniques have been given considerable attention, and progress is being made.See DIVERSEEDS online discussion forum on the integrated approach.

Thirkield Wilbur Patterson Thirkield (September 25, 1854 ‚Äì November 8, 1936) was a Methodist bishop and educator born in Franklin, Ohio. He was the son of Eden Burrows Thirkield, a prominent merchant of that town. The Thirkield family had long been involved with the Methodist Church. James E. Thirkield, Wilbur's grandfather, had moved from Pennsylvania into the Miami River Valley in 1817. In 1825, James and his wife Jane signed the original charter for a Methodist Church in their new hometown of Franklin. Wilbur's family was devoted to Methodism. His father taught Sunday school for years at the church and was a pious man. It is not surprising that at least one of the family would enter the clergy. Wilbur attended Ohio Wesleyan University and the theology school of Boston University. He ultimately received his Doctor of Divinity from the latter school. For most of his career, Wilbur Thirkield championed the cause of education for African Americans. From 1883 to 1900, he was the first president of the Gammon Theological Seminary. From 1900 until 1906 he was in Cincinnati, Ohio as the general secretary of the Freedman's Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Thirkield served as president of Howard University from 1906 until his election to bishop on June 1, 1912. During his tenure at Howard, he was friends with Booker T. Washington, the latter being a member of the board of trustees of the school. Washington was one of Thirkield's strongest supporters on the board at the time. Thirkield finally left Howard to take up duties with the Methodist Church. Thirkield advocated racial cooperation at a time when segregation was not questioned by most. In an address delivered at the Southern Sociological Congress, Atlanta, Georgia, April 25‚Äì29, 1913, Thirkield said: > A cathedral proper represents the religious aspirations and ideals of a > people.

For example, on an ordinary sphere where the geodesics are great circles, the Wiedersehen pairs are exactly the pairs of antipodal points. If every point of an oriented manifold (M, g) belongs to a Wiedersehen pair, then (M, g) is said to be a Wiedersehen manifold. The concept was introduced by the Austro- Hungarian mathematician Wilhelm Blaschke and comes from the German term meaning \\"seeing again\\". As it turns out, in each dimension n the only Wiedersehen manifold (up to isometry) is the standard Euclidean n-sphere.

In the U.S. state of New York, US 15 extends through the Southern Tier from the Pennsylvania state line at Lindley north to an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate 86 and New York State Route 17) just outside Painted Post. US 15 originally continued north to Rochester before being truncated to its present northern terminus. All of US 15 in New York was designated as I-99 on June 27, 2014. Route description Looking southward along US 15 from the Smith Road overpass in Presho prior to the road's completion. The highway previously narrowed from four to two lanes in the background US 15 enters New York adjacent to the state line borough of Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania, at which point the northern segment of I-99 begins. A four-lane freeway through the Steuben County town of Lindley, US 15 crosses through a rock cut, making a large bend to the north and bypassing the hamlet of Presho. I-99/US 15 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with CR 5 (Smith Road). After CR 5, US 15 bent northeast through the town of Erwin, running to the west of the Indian Hills Golf Club. Making a gradual bend further to the northeast, the freeway crosses the Canisteo River and enters the hamlet of Erwin, where it enters a diamond interchange with NY 417 (Addison Road). After NY 417, US 15 makes a bend alongside Norfolk Southern Railroad's Southern Tier Line (former Erie Railroad main line). Now paralleling the tracks and NY 417, US 15 crossed through Erwin, entering exit 3, which connects to NY 417 once again, next to Gang Mills Yard, the site of the former Painted Post station. After Gang Mills Yard, US 15 crosses through the Gang Mills section of Erwin, entering a large interchange at the northern end of the neighborhood. Signed exit 12, this interchange serves CR 107 (Robert Dann Drive) via NY 417. After CR 107, US 15 enters a large interchange that utilizes several flyover ramps between US 15, I-86, and NY 17 (the Southern Tier Expressway). Ramps are also present, connecting to NY 352. This interchange serves as the northern terminus of US 15. History =Origins and designation= Authentic US 15 shield at the former northern terminus in Rochester. The first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. One route assigned at this time was New York State Route 4, a highway extending from the Pennsylvania state line in Lindley to downtown Rochester. NY 4 roughly followed the modern alignment of US 15 from Pennsylvania to Presho, Indian Hill Road from Presho to Erwin, NY 417 from Erwin to Gang Mills, and Hamilton Street from Gang Mills to Painted Post. From Painted Post northward, NY 4 was routed along modern NY 415 to Wayland, from where it continued to Rochester on what is now NY 15. At the state line, NY 4 connected to Pennsylvania Route 4 (PA 4). In 1927, US 4 was first signed in New York. As a result, NY 4 was renumbered to New York State Route 2 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new U.S. Highway. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. By 1929, US 111 was assigned, following what had been PA 4 northward from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to the New York state line at Lawrenceville, where it ended. At some point between 1935 and 1937, US 15 was extended northward from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to the New York state line by way of an overlap with US 111. The overlap between US 15 and US 111 was eliminated when US 111 was truncated southward to Harrisburg. US 15 was extended northward to Rochester by the following April, replacing all of NY 2. =Realignments and truncation= Construction began on a bypass of NY 17 and US 15 in the vicinity of Corning (modern exit 45) and Painted Post (exit 43). The entirety of the highway, plus an extension northwest to Campbell (exit 41), was completed between 1964 and 1968. US 15 and NY 17 were rerouted to follow the new highway, and their former routings between Campbell and Corning were redesignated as NY 415. The portion of the US 15 / NY 17 freeway between Campbell and Avoca (exit 36) was completed by 1973. On July 1, 1974, US 15 was truncated to its current northern terminus in Painted Post and replaced with NY 15 from Painted Post to Rochester. In the mid-1960s, work began on a limited-access highway paralleling US 15 from Presho to the Southern Tier Expressway at Painted Post. The highway was completed and opened to traffic as a realignment of US 15. The interchange between US 15 and NY 17 (now concurrent with I-86) in Painted Post has been redesigned twice. The original configuration of the interchange featured a loop centered around the point where US 15 met NY 17, with ramps providing access to and from the loop from US 15, NY 17, and North Hamilton Street. The second design, in place until 2003, was a semi-diamond interchange, with US 15 intersecting ramps from I-86 and NY 17 at-grade. One connection, I-86 / NY 17 east to North Hamilton Street, was lost in this version due to the ramp setup of the southern half of the interchange. North of the ramps leading to and from I-86 / NY 17 westbound, the right of way of US 15 continued north into Painted Post as North Hamilton Street. The current setup is a directional T interchange, which creates a freeway-to-freeway connection between US 15 and I-86 / NY 17. Separate ramps for North Hamilton Street from I-86 / NY 17 were retained; however, for the first time, there was no direct connection between US 15 and North Hamilton Street. Work on the interchange began in late 2003 and was completed in mid-2008. =Conversion to freeway= In the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, the portion of US 15 in New York was defined as part of I-99. I-99 currently ends just shy of I-80; however, construction is either underway or has been completed on projects to upgrade US 220 and US 15 between Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and Corning to Interstate Highway standards. In June 2007, work began on a new freeway alignment for US 15 between the Pennsylvania state line and Watson Creek Road in Lindley. The highway was opened to traffic on October 1, 2008. Ownership and maintenance of the former surface alignment of US 15 was transferred to Steuben County, which designated the highway as CR 115. Ground was broken September 21, 2009, on the final section of the freeway between Watson Creek Road and Presho. The southbound lanes of the highway opened on August 22, 2013. The northbound lanes opened on October 8. The bridge portion of the project received $9 million in annual Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) funding from 2010 to 2012 and $5.7 million from the state of New York. Local officials had called on state and federal officials to expedite the construction process by paying for the project up front and using ADHS grants in the years to come to pay off the debt later on. The highway was nominated for a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant, but was rejected. On June 27, 2014, Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo announced that US 15 was now designated officially as part of I-99. While signs for US 15 were removed after the designation of I-99, they were restored in 2016, and US 15 and I-99 continue to officially overlap for the entire length of the routes in New York.

But the following year everything went wrong and Landskrona BoIS became instead relegated to tier 3 of Swedish football (as one of 144 teams in 12 regional leagues, instead of 28 teams in two leagues). However the club let him carry on, and after a very weak start he managed to make a turn during the second part of the 22-game league. Landskrona BoIS eventually won the regional tier 3 league and had to face Link√∂ping FF in a home and away game qualification. Everything eventually came to be decided by a penalty shootout at Landskrona IP, of which BoIS came out as the winners and returned to tier 2 of Swedish football in 1986.

After graduating early from public schools in East Cleveland, he played minor league professional baseball in the Cleveland Indians farm system, then entered Vanderbilt University on a football scholarship. He soon transferred to Indiana University and then to the University of Michigan, where he received a B.S. in chemical engineering in 1941 and master's degree one year later. In 1942 Drickamer began work at the Pan American Refinery in Texas City, Texas. After his fellow students played a prank by forging his name on a sign-up sheet for the Ph.D. qualifying exam in chemical engineering, he decided to take the 16-hour exam. After he started work in Texas, he received word that he had passed. He then combined work with study of physics and quantum mechanics, and in February 1946 returned to the University of Michigan for one term to receive his Ph.D. Drickamer joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he subsequently remained for his entire professional career. After his initial appointment as an assistant professor of chemical engineering in 1946, he was promoted to associate professor in 1949 and to full professor in 1953.

The Roman legions established a chain of very large forts at Ardoch, Strageath, Inchtuthil, Battledykes, Stracathro and Raedykes, taking the Elsick Mounth on the way to Normandykes, thence proceeding to the northerly camps of Deers Den and Glenmailen.C. Michael Hogan, Elsick Mounth, The Megalithic Portal, ed Andy Burnham (2007)  National importance  Ythan Wells' national importance is to provide support to modern scholars to understand Roman camps, especially, the constructions, and how they were organized, used and designed. It also gives a cue about the change in their design in history. \\"And their distribution and relationship with each other and with other broadly contemporary monuments in the landscape. This monument can also inform our understanding of the daily lives of Roman soldiers and enhance knowledge of the impact of Roman campaigns on local Iron Age communities and the landscape. The monument at Ythan Wells is particularly valuable because it comprises two superimposed camps of different size and type, and because it is among the northernmost of the Roman camps in Scotland: Ythan Wells I appears to be one of a linear group of particularly large camps in NE Scotland. This camp is also important because part of the defences survive as an upstanding earthwork, indicating high potential for the preservation of important remains, including artefacts and ecofacts. Ythan Wells I was documented by antiquarians in the 18th century, which adds to the understanding of this camp. If this monument were to be lost or damaged, our understanding of Roman camps and our knowledge of Roman military structure and logistics would be significantly diminished.\\" References See also * Cawdor (Roman Fort) * Deers Den * Inchtuthil * Pennymuir Roman camps * Normandykes * Muiryfold Archaeological sites in Aberdeenshire Springs of Scotland Landforms of Aberdeenshire Roman fortified camps in Scotland Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Aberdeenshire ","title":"Ythan Wells"},{"id":"12845360","text":"Bob's your uncle is an expression generally meaning \\"and there you have it.\\" Bob's your uncle or Bob's yer uncle may also refer to: Film and television * Bob's Your Uncle (film), a 1942 British film * Bob's Your Uncle, ITV game show from 1990s Music * Bob's Yer Uncle (band), an alternative rock band in Chicago, IL USA * Bob's Your Uncle (band), a late-1980s alternative rock group in Canada * \\"Bob's Yer Uncle\\", a song by the band Happy Mondays from their album Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches Other * Bob's Your Uncle (play), a 1948 British musical comedy ","title":"Bob's your uncle (disambiguation)"},{"id":"12845363","text":"Leslie Oswald Sheridan Poidevin (5 November 1876 ‚Äì 18 November 1931) was an Australian tennis player and first class cricketer who played for New South Wales and Lancashire.

He would only bat in 23 innings for NSW over the course of his career but his average of 57.73 ranks favourably with the finest who have played for the state. At the turn of the century he came to England to study medicine and began playing cricket for London County. After three seasons with London County he qualified to play for Lancashire and helped them to win the championship in 1904, his debut season with the county. During the season he made 865 runs at 34. He topped Lancashire's averages the following year with 44 after managing a total of 1376 runs. Poidevin also played competitive tennis, representing Australasia in the 1906 Davis Cup as well as in Grand Slams (though missing the 1908 Summer Olympics because of administrative bungling).

The Act is based closely upon the Central Right to Information Act, 2005. Like all RTI legislation, it is intended to provide citizens of the state of Jammu and Kashmir with a legal mandate mechanism for obtaining government records. History =J&K; RTI Act 2004= The Jammu & Kashmir Right to Information Act, 2004, was enacted on 7 January 2004. The Rules to the Act were issued on 30 June 2005. The enactment of this Act came within the larger context of the Right to Information movement in India, which resulted in the passage of several state-level RTI Acts across India, including Tamil Nadu (1997), Goa (1997), Rajasthan (2000), Karnataka (2000), Delhi (2001), Maharashtra (2002), Madhya Pradesh (2003), Assam (2002) and Jammu and Kashmir (2004). The movement culminated in the passage of the (Central) Right to Information Act, 2005, which was partially intended to supersede the various state-level Acts. Furthermore, the (Central) RTI Act, 2005 enshrines stronger provisions than those seen in the individual state-level Acts. As such, the (Central) RTI Act, 2005 applies to the Union Government of India and all of its states and territories, but not to the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Jammu & Kashmir is accorded special provisions under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which exempts most legislation passed in the Parliament of India from automatically applying to the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Instead, under the Constitution of Jammu & Kashmir, the state's own Legislative Assembly has the option of (a) voting to \\"extend\\" a Union Act to its own state using a special legislative procedure, (b) voting to enact a state-specific law of its own using the traditional state-level drafting process, or (c) simply ignoring the Union Act altogether. =J&K; RTI Amendment Act 2008= Despite several years of lobbying by citizens' groups, the government of Jammu & Kashmir opted not to extend the Central Right to Information Act, 2005 to J&K.; Consequently, residents of J&K; seeking information from their state government used the older and weaker Jammu & Kashmir Right to Information Act, 2004. In, September 2007, the government passed the Jammu & Kashmir Right to Information (Amendment) Act, which was duly notified in the Jammu & Kashmir gazette in January 2008. The Amendment Act, 2008 includes several amendments to the original 2004 act to bring it closer in-line with the (Central) RTI Act, 2005, though it has been criticized by citizen's groups for \\"watering down\\" its key provisions. The Amendment Act, 2008 was technically \\"in force\\" but was never implemented in spirit. The Rules to the Amendment Act were never issued, and the crucial Jammu & Kashmir State Information Commission stipulated in the Act was never constituted and appointed. =Present act= In December 2008, the National Conference party led by Omar Abdullah announced that a new RTI Act was among their \\"election manifesto\\" goals. The National Conference was elected to power and Omar Abdullah became the state's Chief Minister. A draft bill was tabled on 7 March 2009, and passed by the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council by 12 March 2009. The Act was gazetted (came into force) on 20 March 2009. The Rules to the Act were gazetted on 6 June 2009. The government is appointing Public Information Officers (PIOs) and Assistant Public Information Officers (APIOs).

Fungie is a dish similar to Italian Polenta, made mostly with cornmeal.\\"Antigua & Barbuda National Dish & Recipe.\\" Recipeisland.com. Accessed July 2011. Other local dishes include ducana, seasoned rice, saltfish and lobster (from Barbuda). There are also local confectionaries which include: sugarcake, fudge, raspberry and tamarind stew and peanut brittle. Jerk chicken cooking Although these foods are indigenous to Antigua and Barbuda and to some other Caribbean countries, the local diet has diversified and now include local dishes of Jamaica, such as jerk meats, or Trinidad, such as Roti, and other Caribbean countries. Common foods and dishes Plaintains Breakfast dishes include saltfish, eggplant (aka troba), eggs and lettuce. Lunches typically include a starch, such as rice, macaroni or pasta, vegetables or salad, an entree (fish, chicken, pork, beef etc.) and a side dish such as macaroni pie, scalloped potatoes or plantains. On Sundays many people in the country go to church and afterward prepare a variety of foods at home. Dinner on Sundays is often eaten earlier (around 2:00 pm) because people are often off from work on Sundays. Dinners may include pork, baked chicken, stewed lamb, or turkey, alongside rice (prepared in a variety of ways), macaroni pie, salads, and a local drink. Dessert may be ice cream and cake or an apple pie (mango and pineapple pie in their season) or gelatin. Antiguan Butter Bread is also a main staple of Antiguan cuisine, a soft buttery loaf of bread that needs no butter added once baked. Many locals enjoy fresh baked butter bread and cheese for breakfast and throughout the day. There are many homes in neighborhoods all over Antigua that have small bakeries built on to them, where locals can go and purchase these fresh baked loaves. They are coupled with cheese, sardines, and a bright red sausage that locals sometimes call salami, and many other foods. They also have what is called provisions with most meals. Provisions are foods that are usually a root or starch like potatoes, yams, sweet potatoes, eddo, etc. During Carnival, souse, a type of soup made very spicy with pigs feet, knuckles, and tails with many onions, is a popular snack, sold by vendors on the side of the road. Black pudding also known as blood sausage, a well seasoned sausage made with rice, meat, and blood is also enjoyed by locals in Antigua. As you travel the roads of Antigua's countryside, you will see locals roasting fresh picked corn, usually in the husk, on makeshift grills ready to be purchased and eaten. Antigua is proud to claim their locally grown pineapples as one of the sweetest types to be found. The Antiguan Pineapple is a very small fruit but often juicy and sweet. There are small pineapple crops throughout the island. Beverages Bottle of mauby Local drinks are mauby, seamoss, tamarind juice, raspberry juice, mango juice, lemonade, coconut milk, hibiscus juice, ginger beer, passion fruit juice, guava juice, soursop juice and ginger beer, a soft drink. Alcoholic drinks include beer, malts and rums, many of which are made locally, including Wadadli beer (named after the original name of the island) and the award winning English Harbour Rum. Many locals drink bottled sodas that they call sweet drink, one popular flavor is punch. The locals also enjoy Red Stripe beer, Malta, Guinness stout and Heineken beer. For the Christmas holidays a special celebratory alcoholic drink that is very popular in Antigua is called Ponche Kuba Cream Liqueur, a thick creamy tan colored drink that is also very sweet and high in alcohol content.

In other words, \\"when I fail to distinguish between what I observed first hand from what I have only inferred or assumed\\". Because it involves making decisions without having enough information to be sure that one is right, this can give rise to poor or rash decisions that often cause more harm to something than good.  Subtypes  Three commonly recognized subtypes are as follows: * Mind reading ‚Äì Where there is a sense of access to special knowledge of the intentions or thoughts of others. People may assume that others think negatively of them. An example is \\"people must hate me because I am fat\\". * Fortune telling ‚Äì Where one has inflexible expectations for how things will turn out before they happen. A person may predict the outcome of something will be negative before they have any evidence to suggest that may be the case. Examples include \\"there's no point starting a diet because I'll just break it\\" and \\"I'll just have one more cupcake\\". * Labeling ‚Äì Where overgeneralizations done because of labeling all the members of a group with the characteristics seen in some, i.e., it involves using an unfavourable term to describe a complex person or event  Information  Jumping to conclusions is a form of cognitive distortion. Often, a person will make a negative assumption when it is not fully supported by the facts. In some cases misinterpretation of what a subject has sensed, i.e., the incorrect decoding of incoming messages, can come about due to jumping to conclusions. This can often be because the same sign can have multiple meanings. An example given in Communicating for Results: A Guide for Business and the Professions is of an employee avoiding eye contact while being questioned over a missing item ‚Äì it may suggest their guilt to the crime, but it may also suggest other things such as their embarrassment at their integrity being questioned, or even a \\"gesture of respect for...authority\\". Even if the questionee shows more signs of guilt, such as sweating and avoiding answers, one is still making an assumption when they link these symptoms to the theft. These assumptions are examples of jumping to conclusions, and could have resulted in faux pas if pursued further without the evidence to back it up. While we all \\"jump to conclusions\\" in a sense by making inferences and assumptions based on the information we have available, and quite often a job requires that one acts upon educated guesswork, in such cases one is making a calculated risk ‚Äì they are aware they are basing their decisions on an assumption which has a degree of uncertainty associated with it. Mistakes are much more likely when people are unaware that they have jumped to conclusions, and instead think that their assumptions are actually knowledge. It is easy for interviewers to jump to conclusions, often resulting in a \\"costly hiring error due to false inference\\". Asking for clarification is a good way to help investigate inferences further. An example of jumping to conclusions is when one makes assumptions about what someone else is going to say, often by cutting them off with the words \\"I know what you're going to say\\". Saying things like \\"wow, geez, and what a shame\\" can make one come across as more interested in looking supportive than what the other person is saying. Therefore, assuming that a story-teller wants overly-compassionate responses can have its downsides, especially if they seem non-genuine and only maintained in order to uphold some kind of social expectation. Working out what context a phrase is being used in can help avoid one jumping to conclusions. In order to prevent the wrongful assessment of children, observation is an essential part of an early years worker's job. Multiple observations, of the child reacting in different circumstances, should be carried out to help show a context for certain symptoms and allow then to work out if they are part of a larger issue. Medical professionals often jump to conclusions. Jerome Groopman, author of How Doctors Think, says that \\"most incorrect diagnoses are due to physicians' misconceptions of their patients, not technical mistakes like a faulty lab test\\". Many doctors jump to conclusions in the following ways: they assume the patient will state all relevant symptoms (or are forced to make an assumption due to thinking that seeking further personal information may lead to embarrassment), they assume the patient will not want to undergo any unpleasant (albeit effective) treatment, they assume the patient is a hypochondriac and therefore do not take their complaints seriously, or they make a diagnosis even though they have not heard or understood all of the complaint and for whatever reason do not ask for clarification.  Comedy  Urban Legends by Jan Harold Brunvand describes how jumping to conclusions, along with the techniques of slapstick humour, can be used to create comedy. The example provided by the book (called The Gerbil-Caused Accident) involves a woman driving to her son's show and tell lesson, with a pet gerbil in a box by her side. It escapes and begins to crawl up her pant leg. She pulls over, gets out of the car, and proceeds to jump up and down and shake her leg in order to get rid of the animal. A passerby think she is having a seizure, so he approaches and wraps his arms around her to calm her down. Another passerby sees the struggle, and assuming the first passerby is an attacker, punches him in the face. The woman then attempts to explain what really happened. The \\"neat\\" 3-part structure and the unresolved conclusion make this example 'legendary'. Sometimes these stories are adapted from real situations, and students are sometimes asked to work out the legal issues involved. In this context, jumping to conclusions is a theme of urban legends. It serves as a twist in which \\"someone jumps to an incorrect conclusion, thus setting himself or herself up for some kind of uncomfortable, often hilarious downfall\\".

Abdias was supposed to have originally written them in Hebrew and Latin, after which they were translated into Ancient Greek by \\"Eutropius\\", his assistant. The claims to the documents being genuine works of Abdias have been widely disputed for several centuries. Their original authorship was first brought into question over book six, which was associated with another assistant of Abdias called \\"Caton\\". Book six covers the lives of Saint Simon and Saint Jude. It has also been noted that a similar volume called the Pseudo-Crato was allegedly written by a disciple of Simon's called Crato. Pseudo-Abdias was published in 1703 by Johann Albert Fabricius in the second volume of a collection he had compiled of apocryphal manuscripts. He subtitled it \\"Acta Apostolorum Apocrypha, sive, Historia Certaminis Apostolici adscripta Abdiae\\" (English: The Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles, or, the History of the Apostolic Struggle ascribed to Abdias). The art historian Otto Demus argued that Pseudo-Abdias was a significant influence upon the designers of the mosaics of St Mark's Basilica in Venice.

Larvae have a short migration inside the mucosa of the intestine and return quickly to the digestive tract. This endoparasite causes a condition often called strongylosis or 'grouse disease' and which can be the cause of regular crashes in grouse populations. When the adult worm burrows into the caeca walls it causes a lot of damage and internal bleeding which in itself is harmful to the grouse. The worms ultimately reduce the digestive efficiency thus affecting the condition of the grouse. The eggs of the strongyle worm found in the caecal droppings of Red Grouse, hatch out into a microscopic larvae stage. Living within the dropping they feed off bacteria and organic matter they develop through two moults reaching their third larval stage, 'L3'. The 'L3' larvae is now at its infective stage so it 'swims' up heather stalks, on a thin film of liquid, to the young shoots where it is most likely to be ingested by a host. Once in the body of a host they enter one of the two caecum in the intestine of the host where the larvae develop into adult worms. The adults mate within the caeca and the female can lay over 100 eggs a day which are passed out in the caecal dropping. The development of the parasite can vary greatly depending on the conditions, namely temperature and humidity. The eggs and larvae can both tolerate periods of low temperature but neither can survive in hot and dry weather. In perfect conditions with high humidity and temperatures exceeding 15 ¬∞C most eggs will hatch within 24 hours, compared with at 5 ¬∞C where the eggs may take several days to hatch out. The larvae can remain active above 6 ¬∞C with relative humidity but when it is colder they halt their development but stay alive. With the climate changing as it is the worms find tolerable conditions for much of the year but they are picked up by grouse at two main periods of the year. The grouse may ingest infective larvae from the heather tips in the summer and early spring. During autumn and winter not all ingested 'L3' larvae will develop into adults, the larvae may begin to moult and temporarily halt their development and attach themselves to the caecum wall, they are said to be in an 'arrested' state. The larvae over-winter in the bird's intestine and in March/April when conditions are more favourable they resume their development. With some other parasites young birds play host to more of the parasites than adults, as the adults develop immunity to the parasites but not in the case of the strongyle worm. With age the worm burden in grouse generally increases as each worm in the intestine of the grouse has to be individually ingested and the adult birds appear to have little resistance to the parasite. The burden of worms is obtained when the birds feed on heather and the young birds feed mainly on insects, for this reason this parasite has little direct bearing on chick survival but can badly affect adults and immature birds. High worm burdens in grouse can lead to mortality and poor condition leading to easy predation and poor reproduction. The strongyle worm burrows into the caecal mucosa which affects the bird's ability to control the scent it emits making them particularly susceptible to mammalian predators who hunt using scent. High burden leading to poor condition of the hen grouse may not affect the clutch size but can affect her ability to incubate the eggs or brood the chicks so this parasite may indirectly affect chick mortality.

The film concerns a volcanologist who learns of an impending eruption at an Italian town and tries to warn the skeptic citizens. Unlike \\"traditional\\" disaster films, the eruption is predicted by supernatural rather than technological means. No seismometers are seen in the entire film.  Summary  The film is about a young volcanologist named Russell Woods (Chris William Martin). In trying to help a village, Woods fails to save his wife Dee from falling into a lava flow. Three months later, in an attempt to bring back memories of his late wife, Woods moves to an Italian town where Dee was born. There, while exploring Dee's birthplace, Woods is angrily confronted by Sylvia (Antonella Elia), the local school principal and the bus driver he met earlier, for trespassing. When Woods explains the situation, Sylvia begins to accept him. Woods is directed to Father Dominic, the leader of the local church, for Dee's records. He also meets an eccentric mute girl, Angela (Sara Malakul Lane), who follows him but runs. It is later learned that Angela's father was killed in a mining accident, and both she and her mother were struck by lightning. Her mother was killed, and Angela was clinically dead but was miraculously revived 20 minutes later. Angela can draw but cannot talk or write. When trying to learn about Angela, Woods is knocked out by Dominic and warned that Angela is \\"evil\\" that she communicates with the dead. However, Woods continues to pursue the truth, and learns that Angela's mother died the same day as Dee did. Angela, at one point, tries to commit suicide but is rescued by Woods and Sylvia. Woods carries Angela to the hospital where she is revived and Dominic tries to perform an exorcism on her. Woods eventually learns that Angela is trying to tell him of the unusual lunar cycles, and in the process, he learns about the impending eruption. Dominic and the villagers are skeptical at first, but are convinced when the volcano begins erupting. Woods leads the townspeople's escape but Angela gets trapped. Right before Angela is rescued, she sees an apparition of Dee, and they smile at each other and Dee's spirit somehow transports her safely out of the way of the lava making her appear right next to Woods. Eventually, Dominic no longer treats Angela as evil, and Woods goes back to Dee's home where he carves his name into a tree below Dee's name and Angela tells him Dee will always be with him.  Similarities with other films and criticism  Some viewers have noted the parallel between The Volcano Disaster and Dante's Peak, while others have criticized that the film was too derivative of Dante's Peak. *In The Volcano Disaster, Woods' wife dies after falling into a lava stream; in Dante's Peak, Dalton's partner dies after being hit by a volcanic bomb *In The Volcano Disaster, Woods hugs Sylvia (who, like Dominic, is also an authority figure) at the end, suggesting that they may begin a romantic relationship; in Dante's Peak, Dalton develops a romantic interest with the female mayor *In both films, the protagonist deals with trying to convince a skeptical community of an impending eruption. There is also a parallel with Volcano; in both films, the signs of volcanic activities is first found in a tunnel.

Through the late 50s and into the mid 60s the club supported an ice hockey section that played in first and second-level competition. In 1965 the section withdrew from the association to become part of Eishockey Club Westphalia Dortmund. = Dortmunder SC 95 = Predecessor side Dortmunder SC 1895 was established on 10 May 1895 as Dortmunder Fussball Club 1895 and is recognized as the city's oldest football club. The team folded in 1897, but was re-formed on 27 October 1899. It was joined by Fussball Club Union Dortmund in 1910 and on 13 July 1913 merged with Ballspielverein 1904 Dortmund to become Sportvereinigung Dortmund 1895 before first adopting the name Dortmunder Sport Club 1895 in 1919. This combined side made an appearance in the top flight regional playoff round in 1920‚Äì21. In 1933, SC briefly merged with Ballspiel Club Sportfreunde 06 Dortmund to play as Sportfreunde 1895 Dortmund in the Gauliga Westfalen, one of sixteen top flight divisions formed that year in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich. The team was relegated after just one season of play there and in 1935 the union ended with the two clubs going their separate ways. Following World War II most organizations in the country, including sports and football clubs, were ordered dissolved by occupying Allied authorities. The club was re-established in 1945 as S√ºdliche Sportgruppe Dortmund and by 1947 was once again playing as SC. The team played lower tier local football until advancing to the Landesliga Westfalen (III) in 1953. They claimed a title there in 1956 and were promoted to the 2. Liga-West (II) where they competed as a lower table side over the next 7 seasons. Restructuring of the country's football competition placed SC into the third division Amateurliga Westfalen in 1963. The club finished atop their group within the division, but missed an opportunity to be advance when they were beaten by Eintracht Gelsenkirchen (2:2, 1:1, 0:2) in an extended promotion playoff. The following season the club tumbled from first to fifteenth place and was relegated to the Landesliga Westfalen (IV) where they earned lower-to-mid table results over the next handful of seasons. After the 1969 merger the football tradition of SC was carried on by Eintracht Dortmund. However, the team stumbled and was sent down to fifth tier competition in 1970.

She was first named after John White, a settler among those who sailed with Richard Grenville, to present-day North Carolina, in 1585, to found the Roanoke Colony. White acted as artist and mapmaker to the expedition. He became the governor, in 1587, of the colony, and his granddaughter, Virginia Dare, was the first English child born in the Americas. She was renamed and commissioned after Menkar, the second- brightest star in the constellation of Cetus. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction John White was laid down on 17 November 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1218, by the St. Johns River Shipbuilding Company, Jacksonville, Florida; she was sponsored by Mrs. Cora E. Owens, a yard employee, and launched on 31 December 1943. She was acquired by the U.S. Navy, under a bareboat charter on 17 January 1944, and renamed Menkar. Placed in temporary commission the next day, Lieutenant Commander Edward G. Gummer, USNR, in command, to be ferried to Miami, Florida, where she decommissioned 22 January, for conversion by Dade Drydock Co.; and commissioned 2 June 1944, Lieutenant Commander Niels P. Thompsen, USCG, in command. Service history Menkar sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, 20 June, and following shakedown, was temporarily assigned to NTS. In late July, she loaded on supplies at Norfolk, and got underway for the Panama Canal Zone, via Guantanamo, Cuba, arriving 11 August, for duty with the U.S. Pacific Fleet. In October 1944, Menkar was transferred to the United States Coast Guard for Long Range Navigation (LORAN) work. Construction of stations for LORAN, a navigational system for ships and planes based on the transmission of radio wave pulses, had only begun in the Pacific Ocean a year before; and a cargo ship was needed to transport material and equipment. On 31 October, Menkar reached Saipan, Marianas, to unload cargo for the first LORAN station in the Marianas chain. On 11 November, she anchored in Apra Harbor, and unloaded supplies for the Guam station. She then continued on to Ulithi, Carolines, arriving 13 December. The Marianas stations proved invaluable in the amphibious assault on Iwo Jima, in February 1945, and in the bombing attacks on Japan, begun in March of that year. On 5 March 1945, Menkar was off Angaur, Palaus, with materials to set up a fixed station. Four days later she was anchored at Pulo Anna, Palaus, unloading her cargo. By the end of March, she had supplied the other two stations of the Palau Mortal chain. The cargo ship next helped tighten the LORAN network around Japan, with the construction of the Iwo Jima‚ÄìTokyo‚ÄìOkinawa chain. Menkar reached Kangoku Iwa, off Iwo Jima, 20 April, just 2 months after the U.S. Marines had first landed. Three days later she departed for Ike Shima, arriving 10 May. In the next 4 days she fought off intermittent Japanese air raids while discharging supplies at Okinawa. She continued on to Katchin Wan Harbor, Okinawa, where she again was harassed by enemy planes. On 18 May, Menkar retaliated by shooting down an \\"Oscar\\" diving directly at the ship. Before construction of the third station at O Shima began, Menkar steamed for the west coast, via Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving Seattle, Washington, 5 August. She remained there through the Japanese surrender 15 August. On 14 September, she departed Seattle, for Pearl Harbor, embarking 307 passengers on arrival on 24 September. She again embarked LORAN units and got underway 9 October, for the Marianas, stopping in the Gilberts and the Marshalls before anchoring at Guam, 26 October. With the construction of a China Sea LORAN chain planned soon after the cessation of hostilities, she continued on to the East China Sea for LORAN duty into the next year. When the project was abandoned, Menkar returned to San Francisco, California, 3 March 1946.

From Chopin's letters it is known that he used the name \\"fantasy\\" to show some sort of freedom from rules and give a Romantic expression. Fr√©d√©ric Chopin continued the tradition of a self-contained movement in his Fantaisie. This Fantaisie is one of Chopin's longest pieces, and is considered one of his greatest works.  Form  This work belongs to the Fantasy form, a composition free in form and inspiration. It begins with a solemn marching theme that eventually plunges into a passionate and virtuosic section, the transition marked poco a poco ‚Ä¶ doppio movimento, still with elements of marching, but more triumphant and positive in mood. About halfway through the piece occurs a slow and sombre chorale-like section in B major, before the previous section is restated. After a short, quiet and sweet statement followed by a final flourish the work ends in a plagal cadence in A-flat major, the relative key. This piece is 11-14 minutes long.

Lichtblau and his wife Leslie Frances Zirkin (b. c. 1973) live in the Washington, D.C. area with their four children, including Matthew and Andrew Lichtblau. Books Lichtblau is the author of Bush's Law: The Remaking of American Justice. With fellow New York Times reporter James Risen, Lichtblau was awarded a 2006 Pulitzer Prize for breaking the story of the National Security Agency's wiretapping program. Using research, Lichtblau's book was first to inform the American public that after 9/11, President George W. Bush had authorized the National Security Agency, in apparent contravention of federal wiretapping law, to eavesdrop on Americans without court warrants. In The Nazis Next Door: How America Became a Safe Haven for Hitler's Men, Lichtblau uncovered the full details of Operation Paper Clip, a story that had been carefully guarded by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for over sixty years. Unknown to Americans, and fully aware of the monstrous crimes many had committed, the CIA provided a safe haven for thousands of Nazi scientists and spies after World War II. Most of the scientists recruited had worked on Hitler's V2 rocket project. Best known of the Nazi scientists was Wernher Von Braun, often described as \\"Father of Rocket Science\\". The V2 rockets killed thousands of British and Belgian citizens during the War and ruthlessly exploited concentration camp prisoners for labor. CIA directors insisted America's dominance in space technology was far more important than prosecuting war criminals. The CIA helped other Nazis gain access to the US to covertly collect information on Communists as part of an overzealous Cold War policy. Elizabeth Holtzman described the book as a \\"fast paced, important book about the justice department's efforts to bring Nazi war criminals in the United States to justice that also uses recently declassified facts to expose the secret, reprehensible collaboration of U. S. intelligence agencies with those very Nazis\\". In both of his books, Lichtblau used first rate research to uncover what many would consider abuses of power by government agencies.Lichtblau, Eric, (2015) The Nazis Next Door, How America Became a Safe Haven for Hitler's Men, Published by Houghton, Mifflin, Harcourt, Boston. Lichtblau said in an interview that \\"Of all the survivors in the camps, only a few thousand came in the first year or so. A visa was a precious commodity, and there were immigration policymakers in Washington who were on record saying that they didn't think the Jews should be let in because they were 'lazy people' or 'entitled people' and they didn't want them in. But there were many, many thousands of Nazi collaborators who got visas to the U.S. while the survivors did not, even though they had been, for instance, the head of a Nazi concentration camp, the warden at a camp, or the secret police chief in Lithuania who signed the death warrants for people.\\" Controversy On October 31, 2016, The New York Times published an article by Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers indicating that intelligence agencies believed that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was not aimed at electing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. It was subsequently revealed that multiple United States intelligence agencies were conducting an investigation at the time into possible covert aid from the Kremlin to the Trump campaign. This led to criticism of Times' coverage of the election, and speculation that the Times reporting, and the October 31 article in particular, contributed to Trump's victory. On January 20, 2017, the Times published an article by the public editor acknowledging that the Times staff, including the editors and Lichtblau, had access to materials and details indicating that the Russian interference was aimed at electing Donald Trump, contradicting the October 31 article, and stating that \\"a strong case can be made that the Times was too timid in its decisions not to publish the material it had\\". Daniel Pfeiffer, former senior advisor to president Barack Obama, characterized the decision not to publish the story while at the same time publishing many articles that fueled the Hillary Clinton email controversy as a \\"black mark\\" in the newspaper‚Äôs history. The New York Times editor Dean Baquet dismissed the controversy, stating that the public editor article is a \\"bad column\\" that comes to a \\"fairly ridiculous conclusion\\". It was later reported that in the editing of the piece, New York Times editors \\"downplayed what Lichtblau and Myers wanted to highlight\\" in the article and 'cast the absence of a conclusion as the article's central theme rather than the fact of the investigation itself,' contrary to the wishes of the reporters.\\" https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/05/16/new-york-times- acknowledges-it-buried-the-lead-in-pre-election-russia-trump-story/ See also *Alfa-Bankhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/was-there-a- connection-between-a-russian-bank-and-the-trump-campaign Works *2008: Bush's Law: The Remaking of American Justice (Pantheon, ) *2014: The Nazis Next Door: How America Became a Safe Haven for Hitler's Men (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, ) References External links *Recent and archived news articles by Eric Lichtblau of The New York Times * 1965 births Living people The New York Times writers Cornell University alumni Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting winners People from DeWitt, New York Jewish American journalists American Jews ","title":"Eric Lichtblau"},{"id":"12845893","text":"USS Bluebird or USS Blue Bird has been the name of more than one United States Navy ship, and may refer to: * , a patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1919 * , a minesweeper in commission from 1940 to 1945 * , a submarine rescue ship in commission from 1946 to 1950 * , a minesweeper in commission from 1953 to 1968 and in non-commissioned service as a training ship from 1968 to 1971 United States Navy ship names ","title":"USS Bluebird"},{"id":"12845896","title":"The Pyramids (band)"},{"id":"12845913","text":"The Last Frontier is an American Pre-Code 12-chapter serial, distributed by RKO Radio Pictures in 1932.

Hurricane Dean of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season formed in the Atlantic Ocean west of Cape Verde on August 14, 2007. The National Hurricane Center's first Forecast Advisory on the system anticipated that the Cape Verde-type hurricane would pass into the Caribbean through the Lesser Antilles. The storm moved persistently towards the small island chain, strengthening until it passed through the islands three days later on August 17 as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It went on to brush the island of Jamaica and reached Category 5 strength before making landfall on Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula. While crossing the Lesser Antilles, Dean caused moderate damage in St. Lucia, Martinique, and Dominica, where it washed out roads, damaged houses, and killed 6 people. It also devastated the agriculture-dependent economies of those three states, as well as that of Guadeloupe, destroying between 80% and 100% of the banana crops. Deaths were reported as far away as Trinidad.  Preparations  The National Hurricane Center consistently predicted that the storm would intensify and pass through the islands. As Hurricane Dean approached, the island nations began to prepare with a flurry of activity. On August 14 the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) placed its Regional Response Mechanism on standby and contacted the National Disaster Coordinators of all member states in the Lesser Antilles. On August 15 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) dispatched teams to Barbados, Dominica, and St. Kitts in advance of the hurricane to provide damage assessment should the hurricane affect those islands. At 11 p.m. AST August 15 (0300 UTC August 16) the respective governments of St. Lucia, Martinique, Saba, St. Eustatius, and Guadeloupe and its dependencies issued Hurricane watches and the government of the Netherlands Antilles issued a tropical storm watch for the island of St. Maarten, as then-Tropical Storm Dean was expected to intensify to hurricane strength and reach the Windward Islands within 36 hours. Authorities in Martinique canceled a memorial to the victims of West Caribbean Airways Flight 708 and began to set up shelters. At 5 a.m. AST (0900 UTC) August 16 the respective governments of St. Lucia and Dominica issued hurricane warnings in anticipation of Hurricane Dean's imminent approach. In Dominica, a dozen and a half tourists were evacuated to concrete shelters. The government of Dominica also canceled leave for emergency service personnel and evacuated Princess Margret Hospital, fearing that its roof might be vulnerable to the storm's winds. At the same time the Meteorological Service of Barbados issued a tropical storm warning for Barbados and a tropical storm watch for St. Vincent. Three hours later, at 8 a.m. AST (1200 UTC), the Meteorological Service of Antigua issued a tropical storm watch for Montserrat, Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis and Barbuda. Shortly thereafter the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service issued a tropical storm watch for Grenada and its dependencies. The Eastern Caribbean Donor Group convened a meeting on August 16 under the Chair of the Resident Representative United Nations Development Programme Barbados in anticipation of the hurricane causing significant damage and member states requiring international assistance. At 11 a.m. AST (1500 UTC) the Barbados Meteorological Service issued tropical storm warnings for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Government of the Netherlands Antilles discontinued the hurricane watch on Saba and St. Eustatius, replacing it with a tropical storm warning. At 5 p.m. AST (2100 UTC) August 16, roughly 15 hours before Hurricane Dean arrived, the Government of France issued hurricane warnings for Martinique and Guadeloupe and its dependencies, and the NHC issued a tropical storm watch for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. At 8 p.m. AST (2100 UTC) August 16 the Meteorological Service of Antigua issued a tropical storm warning for Anguilla. Martinique's main airport and both of St. Lucia's commercial airports closed that night when the last airplanes landed as the storm's outer rainbands began to sweep over the island. At 11 p.m. AST August 16 (0300 UTC August 17) the NHC upgraded the tropical storm watch on U.S. Virgin Islands to a tropical storm warning. The next morning, August 17, the center of Hurricane Dean passed between St. Lucia and Martinique. The Meteorological Service of Antigua issued a tropical storm warning for the British Virgin Islands that same morning, and the Eastern Caribbean Donor Group convened a second meeting to finalize the coordination of three Rapid Assessment Teams.  Impact  The storm entered the Caribbean through the Saint Lucia Channel between St. Lucia and Martinique on the morning of August 17 as a Category 2 storm with winds of 90 knots (100 mph, 165 km/h). = St. Lucia = Banana trees in Roseau Valley, St. Lucia, decimated by Hurricane Dean. Power outages began in some neighborhoods at 6:30 p.m. AST (2230 UTC) August 16, over 12 hours before the storm arrived, and quickly spread over the entire island. The night saw heavy rains, 4 cm (1.58 inches) at Hewanorra International Airport,History : Weather UndergroundHistory : Weather Underground and intense thunderstorms and by morning hurricane-force winds peaked at 80 knots (90 mph, 145 km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Hurricane Dean tore the corrugated metal roof off Victoria Hospital's pediatric ward, but its patients had already been evacuated. St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort was also damaged when part of the roof blew off its medical ward and fell through the roof of the emergency room. A section of the cafeteria also lost its roof, but no one was injured in either incident. The capital, Castries, was flooded by the storm surge and high seas deposited boulders and fishing boats on the streets. One person drowned in Sarrot after being swept away by a rain-swollen river while trying to recover a cow. Flooding was also reported in the town of Dennery where a number of residents had to be evacuated. Nationwide, damage to housing and buildings totaled EC$800,000. In the worst hit areas of the north, closest to Hurricane Dean's path, at least 15 roofs were blown off. Two small waterfront houses were completely destroyed in the town of Gros Islet. The heavy seas also sunk or damaged several boats and damaged coastal roads, in some places eroding the land itself. Coastal damage was estimated at $700,000. Although the Ministry of Education reported that eleven schools had sustained a combined total of $300,000 of damage, the Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities reported that most of the country's other major infrastructure remained functional. They estimated that the cost to clean up all of the roads and drains was $900,000 and the cost to repair the utilities and communications damage was another $505,000. Saint Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority reported another $922,000 of damage, but none of these sectors experienced prolonged disruptions to their functionality. The island's of banana farms in Mabouya Valley, Roseau Valley, and Marc Marc were severely damaged with many of the plantations waterlogged or outright destroyed. An average of 75% of the crops were lost, with some fields in the Northern Farms losing up to 80% and in the Roseau Valley losing up to 85%. The cost to the agriculture industry was $13.2 million, bringing Hurricane Dean's total cost to $17.3 million (US$6.4 million in 2007) or 0.5% of the nation's GDP. = Martinique = A lifeguard tower stands amongst fallen palm trees in Martinique, two days after Hurricane Dean's passage. Martinique experienced 160 km/h winds with gusts to 215 km/h. The torrential rainfall, which reached 332 mm (13.07 inches) caused flooding throughout the island, with the town of Rivi√®re-Pilote flooding completely. The majority of Martinique's population were left without electricity, water, telephone, or food. The storm destroyed Martinique's entire banana crop, and 70% of the island's sugar cane plantations. Three people were killed, many more were injured, and 600 Martiniquans were left homeless. The banana fields were completely destroyed. Officials estimated the damage on the island at about ‚Ç¨250 million (US$337 million). = Dominica = In Dominica, a mother and her seven-year-old son died when one of a dozen landslide caused by the heavy rains fell onto their house. Landslides also blocked several roads in the mountainous country. In another incident two people were injured when a tree fell on their house. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit initially estimated that 100 to 125 homes were damaged, but in actuality Hurricane Dean damaged many more: 183 houses lost their roofs completely, 205 houses sustained partial damage to their roofs, 43 houses were completely destroyed, 115 houses suffered significant structural damage to components other than their roofs, and 225 non-dwelling buildings were damaged. In total, 771 buildings suffered significant damage. Princes Margret Hospital, the island's only hospital, suffered damage to the roofs of the psychiatric and intensive care units. This led to heavy water damage, which also spread into the maternity ward and damaged the electrical system. All of the patients had been evacuated before the storm arrived. Because most equipment and supplies had also been removed, the hurricane's cost to the health sector was limited to the EC$3 million of structural damage. The storm surge caused EC$15.5 million of damage to sea walls and another EC$15 million of damage to coastal bridges. Floods and landslides contributed EC$17.6 million of damage to the island's road network, while river floods destroyed EC$45.5 million of river walls. Flooding also devastated the agriculture sector and 95% of the crops were lost. Replanting a rehabilitation of the banana trees, 99% of which were destroyed, was expected to take several years. = Guadeloupe = Overall damage from Dean is fairly minor in Guadeloupe. However the south of Basse-Terre Island suffered moderate damage and sustained wind gust up were between in areas such as Marie Galante and Les Saintes, in the Southern section of the island and destroyed 80% and cost ‚Ç¨150 million (US$220 million) in Guadeloupe of the banana crop. The country's main exports. = Elsewhere = Although the winds and rain of the hurricane did not reach as far south as the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, sea swells on the east coast killed two people as they tried to secure a boat.  Aftermath  St. Lucia and Dominica activated their Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) response systems to help assess and correct the storm's damages. CDERA acknowledged their requests and, based on preliminary damage assessments, initiated a Level Two response which allowed for the event to be managed at the country level with regional assistance limited to technical support and resources where required. Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada also activated their CDERA response systems. Although they were not directly affected by the hurricane they used the opportunity to test the systems' operating procedures. The other affected islands of the Lesser Antilles, Martinique and Guadeloupe, are not members of CDERA. CDERA dispatched a technical support team of Bajans, Montserratians, and Grenadians to Dominica on August 22 to assist in developing a damage assessment. The Government of Venezuela sent 500 blankets, 500 sheets, 3 large tents, 120 units of tarpaulin, water, and medical supplies to Dominica. The Government of Canada pledged $2 million in immediate aid to the afflicted countries. The U.S. Government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), declared a disaster in Dominica and St. Lucia and provided $25,000 and 75 rolls of plastic sheeting to Dominica for emergency shelter repairs and an additional 50 rolls of plastic sheeting to St. Lucia through its National Emergency Management Organization. CDERA petitioned the Caribbean Development Bank for a US$100,000 relief grant to assist with relief efforts and damage repairs in St. Lucia and Dominica. Although St. Lucia suffered significant damage to its residential structures and agricultural land, its airports and hotels were operational within days having needed only small-scale repair work. Hospitals and other essential services kept running on standby power supplied by independent generators to assist in the cleanup and recovery efforts. Roads connecting the north and south of the island were quickly cleared. LUCELEC, the nation's only electricity provider, worked around the clock to repair dozens of downed electrical poles and restored electricity by August 21. The rest of the island's infrastructure weathered the storm. Two shelters were opened for hurricane-affected residence, and USAID/OFDA provided US$40,432 of assistance to the island. Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit declared August 19, 2007 to be a national day of prayer and thanks-giving. The destruction of 546 residences forced approximately 1,000 people into 100 shelters. A USAID disaster specialist liaised with the Dominican Office of Disaster Management and arraigned for assistance to the order of US$60,648 of relief supplies and $25,000 of Emergency Shelter supplies. In the days after to storm, some residents of Martinique, still without electricity, food, water, or telephones, took to looting stores and bakeries. Utility workers from Guadeloupe, French Guiana, and France arrived on August 19 to help restore electricity. The Secretary of State for the French Overseas, Christian Estrosi, visited Martinique shortly after the hurricane to inspect the damage. He was joined by French Prime Minister, Fran√ßois Fillon on August 22 and the two surveyed the damaged to Guadeloupe and Martinique, the two hardest hit French colonies. A week after the storm hit 11,000 people in Martinique were still without telephone and electricity and in the worst hit parts of southern Guadeloupe the water was still not drinkable. Banana crops in Guadeloupe, 80% of which were destroyed by Dean, will not recover until March, 2008.

Biography =English roots= Crandall was born in 1618 (baptized February 15, 1617/8) in Westerleigh, Gloucestershire, England to James Crandall, a yeoman of Kendleshire in that parish, and his first wife Eleanor. The name was probably taken from Crundelend in Abberley, Worcestershire, where people bearing the name were concentrated in the 16th century. Crandall's great-grandfather Nicholas Crundall (died 1589) of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire came to south Gloucestershire in 1572 as the vicar of the parish of Winterbourne. Nothing else is known of John Crandall's life in England prior to his emigration to America, except that his relatives started spelling the name \\"Crandall\\" around 1610.Paul M. Gifford, \\"The Probable Origins and Ancestry of John Crandall, of Westerly, Rhode Island (1618-1676),\\" Rhode Island Roots 32, no. 4 (Dec. 2006): 165-86 =In America= The first documentation for Crandall in America is in 1643 when he appears as a grand jury member in Newport. He became a prominent member of the First Baptist Church in Newport, and subsequently the first elder of the denomination at Westerly, Rhode Island. He went to Lynn, Massachusetts with John Clarke and Obadiah Holmes to hold services for the Baptists; he was arrested there on July 21, 1651 and sent to prison in Boston. Ten days later, he was convicted of breaking the law by holding services and fined five pounds, in default of which he was to be publicly whipped. He was released upon his promise to appear at the next term of court. In 1655, he was a freeman of Rhode Island; he was a commissioner in 1658-59 and 1662‚Äì63. He signed a letter with eight others to the court of commissioners of Rhode Island dated August 27, 1661 in relation to a tract of land at Westerly where they desired to settle. He and Joseph Torrey were appointed commissioners on May 14, 1669 to treat with Connecticut concerning the jurisdiction of disputed territory, and the colony of Rhode Island gave him 35 shillings to pay his expenses to Connecticut. On November 18, 1669, he received a letter from the governor and assistants of Connecticut complaining that he and others had appropriated a large tract of land belonging to Stonington, Connecticut. He and Tobias Saunders answered the complaint on behalf of the Westerly people. He was conservator of the peace at Westerly in 1670, and deputy to the general assembly again in 1670-71. The Connecticut authorities arrested him on May 2, 1671, but the Rhode Island government advised him not to give bond and promised to pay his expenses and defend him. He had at least seven children by his first wife. His second wife was Hannah Gaylord (born 1647), daughter of William and Ann (Porter) Gaylord of Windsor, Connecticut. She died in 1678. He died at Newport, where he had moved in 1676 because of King Philip's War.John Cortland Crandall, Elder John Crandall and His Descendants (New Woodstock, N.Y.: The Author, 1949). passim.

She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction Mary Patten was laid down on 21 July 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCE hull 1725, by the Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2,Richmond, California; launched on 11 August 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Otis A. Kent; acquired by the Navy on 7 October 1943; renamed Azimech and designated AK-124 on 11 October 1943; converted for naval service at Oakland, California, by the Moore Dry Dock Company; and commissioned on 29 October 1943, Lieutenant Commander Earl P. Gaither in command. Service history After a brief shakedown, the cargo ship got underway on 11 November, for Hawaii. At Pearl Harbor, she was assigned for duty to Service Squadron 8, US Pacific Fleet. The ship discharged her cargo and then entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for an overhaul of her main engines and boilers. Azimech was on keelblocks for 16 days, then began loading cargo. She set sail on 28 December, for the Gilbert Islands. =Supporting Tarawa operations= Azimech reached Tarawa on 8 January 1944, and began unloading her cargo. The process was hampered by frequent enemy air attacks and reefs in the lagoon which permitted the ship to unload only at high tide. Azimech made additional stops at Makin and Apamama Islands before heading back to Pearl Harbor. After a brief stop in Hawaii, Azimech continued on to the US West Coast and moored at San Pedro, California, on 6 March. Following an availability period at Terminal Island from 10 March until 9 April, she filled her holds with cargo at Oakland, California, and began the voyage back to Hawaii on 26 April. = Providing service at Majuro and Eniwetok = On 7 May, Azimech sailed from Pearl Harbor with a convoy bound for Majuro. They reached that naval base on 18 May, and reported to Service Squadron 10 for duty. The cargo ship lay at anchor in Majuro lagoon, issuing stores to forces ashore, until 3 June, when she got underway for Eniwetok. After serving at that atoll until 24 August, she steamed back to Hawaii; paused for one day at Pearl Harbor; and then pushed on to the US West Coast. = Servicing Ulithi and Kossol Roads = The ship reached San Francisco, California, on 13 September, to begin reloading operations. While taking on cargo, she also received minor repairs and alterations before heading west again on 26 September. After stops at Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, Azimech arrived at Ulithi on 2 November. She operated there until 16 November and then steamed in company with to Kossol Roads. Two days later, the ships reached their destination, and Azimech began issuing supplies. On 5 December 1944, the vessel weighed anchor and traveled back to Pearl Harbor via Ulithi and Eniwetok. = Overhaul at the Puget Sound Navy Yard = Following the holidays, Azimech got underway for Seattle, Washington, and entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 16 January 1945, for repairs. On 15 February, she began steaming for Eniwetok and reached that atoll on 11 March. Following eight days at Ulithi, she set sail for the Ry≈´ky≈´s. = Supporting Okinawa and Guam = Azimech remained anchored off Kerama Retto from 18 to 29 April. On the latter day, she shifted berth to Hagushi beach, Okinawa, her base until 7 May, when she sailed for Guam. The cargo ship began loading cargo there on 24 May, and did not finish the task until 8 June. She then got underway for Ulithi and, on 10 June, anchored in that lagoon where she remained for the duration of the war. Inactivation and decommissioning On 23 August, Azimech shaped a course for the coast of southern California.

It was released by Universal Pictures. The film was released in the United Kingdom under the title Heart of a Wolf. The film stars Chaney as the leading character, Alan Hale as his rival, and Irene Rich as the female lead. Chaney had also appeared in an unrelated film of the same name in 1913. The film also features in a minor role Chaney's son Creighton in his film debut. Plot As described in a film magazine, Gaspard the Good (Chaney) returns from a trip to his traps to find his sweetheart Thalie (Godowsky) deeply interested in a newcomer, Benson (Hale). When Gasperd goes to his mine he finds Benson's men in possession, he having acquired it through a legal technicality. Broken in health and spirit, Gaspard waits. Benson marries Thalie and, in the seven years that follow, she becomes ill and dies, leaving a son. Benson is thrown in jail for shooting a Swede, whom Gaspard had urged to fight Benson. Gaspard takes the child to his cabin and, knowing that Benson will come after his release from prison to claim his child, plans an awful revenge. He arranges a trap in his cabin that he hopes Benson will walk into and be eaten by a hungry wolf that has been penned up. The boy, however, walks into the trap, and Gaspard is nearly killed rescuing him. Then Benson comes, and Gaspard, having learned a lesson, turns the boy over to him and wishes them Godspeed.

The oil was delivered in breach of the South African oil embargo, and the ship was scuttled to fraudulently claim insurance.  History  = Ship = The tanker, T/T Sea Sovereign, was commissioned in 1969 in Stockholm for Sal√©nrederierna AB and built at the Kockums shipyard in Malm√∂. In 1977 Sal√©nrederierna sold the tanker to Pimmerton Shipping Ltd. (Liberia), as South Sun and ship management was placed in the hands of Wallem Ship Management Ltd. (Hong Kong). Two years later South Sun was sold to Oxford Shipping Inc. (U.S.). The ship was renamed Salem, but remained under the Liberian flag. = Loading and sinking= On 30 November 1979 Salem left the port of Piraeus to load oil in the Kuwaiti port of Mina Al Ahmadi, on behalf of an Italian charterer. She loaded approximately 194,000 tons of light crude oil to be discharged in Genoa. The tanker, with its cargo, was insured at Lloyd's of London. She left Mina Al Ahmadi on 10 December and proceeded down the East African coast. On 27 December under the name Lema she entered the port of Durban, South Africa. There, the ship discharged 170‚Äì180,000 tons of cargo, and took on the same amount in ballast water in order to stay on a laden draft. She departed Durban on 2 January 1980. On 17 January 1980, under the name Salem, she was found off the Senegalese coast in distress. The British tanker British Trident rescued the crew of the sinking tanker. =Fraud= Four days after leaving the port of Mina Al Ahmadi, the charterers in Genoa sold the cargo to the Shell Group for [US$]56 million. This type of transaction is not uncommon. When the British tanker Trident rescued the shipwrecked Salem crew, it was observed that not only had the crew taken all their belongings in suitcases but they had gone so far as to rescue a number of other items including duty-free goods and sandwiches, although the tanker was supposed to have sunk so quickly, after several explosions, that there was not enough time to save the ship's log. Far more striking was that, despite the ostensible cargo of nearly 200,000 tons of crude oil and having suffered sufficient explosion damage to cause her to sink, there was barely a trace of the vessel left on the surface. = Aftermath= After Salem‚Ä≤s loss, Lloyd's of London received an insurance claim of US$56.3 million from the owner of the cargo. It was the largest single claim that Lloyd's had received up to that time. Research by Lloyd's revealed that the South African oil company Sasol, had bought the Lema / Salem cargo in Durban for US$43 million. References *Stewart, I.G.

Jang Song Taek, North Korean Leadership Watch. ‚Äì 12 December 2013) was a leading figure in the government of North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or DPRK). He was married to Kim Kyong-hui, the only daughter of North Korean Premier Kim Il-sung, and only sister of North Korean general secretary Kim Jong-il. He was therefore the uncle (by marriage) of current leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un. Although the precise extent of Jang Song- thaek's power and position during his life cannot be confirmed, in 2008 South Korean government officials and academic North Korea experts suggested that he had taken on de facto leadership over North Korea while Kim Jong-il's health was declining and when Kim subsequently died. Jang was vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission, a position considered second only to that of the Supreme Leader. He is believed to have been promoted to four-star general around the time of Kim Jong-il's death in December 2011, as his first appearance in uniform was while visiting Kim lying in state. Jang was considered a \\"key policy adviser\\" to Kim Jong-un. In December 2013, Jang was abruptly accused of being a counter-revolutionary and was stripped of all his posts and expelled from the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). His photos were removed from official media and his image digitally removed from photos with other North Korean leaders. On 13 December, North Korea state media announced he had been executed. There have been external reports that many members of his family have also been killed. Early life and family Jang was born in Chongjin, during the Soviet Civil Administration of Northern Korea. He graduated from the Kim Il-sung Senior High School before leaving for Moscow, where he studied at Moscow State University between 1968 and 1972.James E. Hoare, Jang Seong-taek, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Following his return, he married Kim Kyong-hui, the younger (and only) sister of Kim Jong-il. The couple had a daughter, Jang Kum-song (1977‚Äì2006), who lived in Paris as an international student; she refused an order to return to Pyongyang and then reportedly committed suicide in September 2006, due to Jang and his wife's opposition to her relationship with her boyfriend. Early career Beginning in the 1970s, Jang held a series of positions in the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). His first post was as an instructor for the Pyongyang City Committee of the Workers' Party.Associated Press, \\"Leader's Uncle Rose To No. 2 In North Korea\\", 13 December 2013. In the late 1970s, however Jang's career stalled when he was sent away from the central party to be manager of a steel and ironworks in Nampo, an apparent demotion. Reports said that he was becoming too powerful or, according to other accounts, he had an over-ostentatious lifestyle. It was reported that Jang suffered severe burns in an industrial accident at the factory in Chollima/Kangson.Jang Song Taek, North Korea Leadership Watch. His career recovered and he became deputy director of the Youth Work Department of the WPK Central Committee in 1982 and director in 1985. He was first elected to the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), North Korea's nominal parliament, in 1986. In April 1989, Jang was made a People's Hero; in June 1989, he was elected an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. In April 1992, he was named a member of the Order of Kim Il-sung. Later that year he was promoted to full member of the Central Committee. He was a member of the funeral committee for Kim Il- sung in 1994. Jang was appointed to be the first deputy director (or vice director) of the WPK's Organization and Guidance Department in November 1995. He had been identified by outside analysts as well as North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop as a possible successor to Kim Jong-il; however, on 25 November 2004, South Korea's National Assembly heard testimony that he had been purged from his position. Some South Korean intelligence reports indicated that Jang was under house arrest in Pyongyang, while others suggested he might have been sent for \\"reeducation\\".Profile: Chang Song-thaek, BBC News (12 December 2013). Rehabilitation Jang re-emerged in March 2006, accompanying Kim Jong-il on an official visit to China. In October 2007, the Korean Central News Agency confirmed that Jang had been promoted to the newly recreated post of first vice-director of the Workers' Party of Korea, with oversight responsibility for the police, judiciary, and other areas of internal security; Jang attended South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's luncheon during the latter's visit to the North. It was later revealed that Jang had been actually appointed director of the Administration Department, an old agency of the Workers' Party abolished in 1990 and re-created by splitting the Organization Department. He was elected to the National Defence Commission (NDC) in April 2009. He was made vice-chairman of the commission in summer 2010. During this period he was a close ally of Kim Jong-il. Jang was still in the post four years later, in April 2013. The NDC is North Korea's de facto supreme decision-making body; Jang's promotion made him a key executive deputy, second only to Kim Jong-il. It is speculated that the move was part of posturing to make Kim Jong-il's son Kim Jong-un the next leader of North Korea. Jang's position in North Korean politics was also ostensibly boosted by the death of Ri Je-gang, a senior leader who was tipped by Kim Jong-il as a crucial overseer of the succession campaign. Under Kim Jong-un On 25 December 2011, North Korean television Sunday showed Jang in the uniform of a general. A Seoul official familiar with North Korea affairs said it was the first time Jang had been shown on state television in a military uniform. His appearance suggested that Jang had secured a key role in the North's military, which had pledged its allegiance to Kim Jong-un. Jang's importance continued to be demonstrated during his 2012 visit to China: various aspects of the visit echoed protocol which had previously been followed only for Kim Jong-il, including half of his entourage arriving ahead of time as an advance party, with the Chinese ambassador to North Korea, Liu Hongcai, returning to China beforehand to greet Jang upon his arrival. On 17 August 2012, Jang met with China's premier, Wen Jiabao in Ziguangge, Zhongnanhai. He met with Hu Jintao, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Wang Jiarui, head of China's international department of the CPC central committee and minister in charge of the national development and reform commission, Zhang Ping, minister of finance Xie Xuren, minister of commerce Chen Deming, Liaoning provincial Party Committee Secretary Wang Min, Jilin provincial Party Committee Secretary Sun Zhengcai, and vice foreign minister Zhang Zhijun. He was the head of a delegation of the joint steering committee for developing and managing the Rason Economic and Trade Zone and the Hwanggumpyong and Wihwa Islands Economic Zone. In the announcement, he was listed as chief of the central administrative department of the Workers' Party of Korea, a member of the WPK political bureau, and vice-chairman of the National Defense Commission.Nathan Beauchamp-Mustafaga, \\"Show Me the Money: Evaluating Jang Song-thaek‚Äôs Search for Economic Cooperation in Beijing,\\" Sino-NK, 19 August 2012. Jang said Kim Jong-un believed that bilateral relations with China are important and that the \\"profound friendship will be passed on from generation to generation\\" between China and North Korea. At the meeting with Wen, Jang said: \\"The DPRK is willing to closely cooperate with China to accelerate relevant efforts and push forward cooperation in developing economic zones.\\" On 4 November 2012, the WPK Central Committee Politburo established a new State Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission, appointing Jang as its first chairman. An analyst suggested that this quiet promotion may have signaled a decline in Jang's status: in North Korea, \\"although sports can bring quick popularity, earn foreign exchange, raise patriotic fever, and help burn the energies of the youth and distract the masses from their daily hardships, it can never beat national security and socio-economic development in terms of its political significance. By asking Jang to chair the National Sports Commission, the young North Korean leader, less than a year into power, might have begun to nudge his uncle out of important policy deliberations.\\"Alexandre Mansourov, \\"North Korea: The Dramatic Fall of Jang Song Thaek\\", U.S.-Korea Institute at SAIS, 9 December 2013. In January 2013, speculation arose that Jang had been quietly promoted to top decision-making Politburo Presidium member, as his official hierarchy position was elevated, displacing then-Chief of General Staff Hyon Yong-chol and his own wife Kim Kyong-hui. An analyst argued that Jang might be appointed president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly (making him the nominal head of state of the DPRK) or Premier of North Korea, replacing officeholders who were in their 80s. Jang Song-thaek promoted the construction of a new bridge over the Yalu River between the Chinese city of Dandong and the Korean city of Sinuiju. , the bridge was nearly completed. That same month, Jang was not invited to the meeting of top North Korean officials handling national security and foreign affairs, following a rocket launch on 12 December 2012, and new international sanctions in response. Following Jang's fall from power, an analyst noted that Jang's \\"glaring absence\\" at the January 2013 meeting \\"signaled the emergence of a possible crack in the senior leadership, especially in the relationship between Kim and his all-powerful uncle, raising the possibility of divergent approaches between Kim and Jang\\" on North Korea foreign policy. In late May 2013, Choe Ryong-hae, a vice-chairman of Central Military Commission and director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army (KPA), was sent as Kim Jong-un's first special envoy to China, passing over Jang. An analyst viewed this as a \\"striking\\" choice, and noted that \\"it appears that as the perceived 'China man in Pyongyang, Jang's \\"perceived close ties with China may have done a disservice to his standing in the eyes of Kim, exposed him to criticism of being too subservient to China, and made him vulnerable to any anti-China backlash in Pyongyang\\". Thought by analyst Alexandre Mansourov of 38 North to have been particularly unacceptable to Kim Jong-un were Jang's \\"continued expression of sympathy towards\\" Kim Jong-nam‚ÄîKim Jong-un's half- brother and Kim Jong-il's eldest son‚Äîwho was living in exile under Chinese protection at the time. According to the New York Times, the final straw came from a dispute over control of North Korea's west coast fisheries. These had been partly taken from the military by Jang Song-thaek in 2011, but later this decision was reversed and the fisheries were ordered returned to the military. Forces loyal to Jang defied the transfer, leading to a confrontation in late 2013, in which several North Korean soldiers loyal to Kim Jong-un were killed. Subsequent reinforcements sent by Kim Jong-un seized control of the fisheries. Downfall Soon after, in November 2013, Jang's senior aides Ri Ryong-ha and Jang Su-gil were executed. Ri was reportedly accused of abusing his authority, while Jang Su-gil was found guilty of trying to organize a new faction and rejecting the system.\\"Where Is Kim Jong-un?, Chosun, 6 December 2013.\\"N Korea film 'edits out dismissed uncle Chang Song-thaek'\\", BBC News, 6 December 2013. Retrieved 13 December 2013. Jang had not been seen in public since. On 3 December, he was dismissed from his post. On 7 December, his appearances were obscured or edited out from a news report (originally aired in October) that re-aired on Korean Central Television. On 8 December, Jang Song-thaek was publicly expelled from the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, with state media attributing this to a decision of the Politburo. Jang was accused of having committed \\"anti-party, counter-revolutionary factional acts\\" that included illicit affairs with women; harboring \\"politically-motivated ambition\\"; weakening \\"the party's guidance over judicial, prosecution and people's security bodies\\" and obstructing \\"the nation's economic affairs\\". Jang's arrest at a politburo meeting was broadcast on Korean Central Television, the state television broadcaster, in \\"the most public dismissal... in history\\" of a prominent North Korean official, and the first time since the 1970s that a senior politician was arrested in a party meeting on live television. Wen Wei Po reported that Lee Yun-keol (the chairman for the Seoul-based North Korea Strategy Information Service Center) stated that Kim Jong-chul (Kim Jong-un's elder brother) had personally led his guards to arrest Jang.Want China News, \\"Kim Jong-un's brother led arrest of Jang Sung-taek: source\\" , 12 December 2013.

A 2,700-word statement was released, stating that the \\"despicable human scum Jang, who was worse than a dog, perpetrated thrice-cursed acts of treachery in betrayal of such profound trust and warmest paternal love shown by the party and the leader for him\\". The statement detailed many charges against Jang, stating that he \\"had desperately worked for years to destabilize and bring down the DPRK and grab the supreme power of the party and state by employing all the most cunning and sinister means and methods\\".Alexandre Mansourov, \\"North Korea: What Jang's Execution Means for the Future\\", 38north.org; 13 December 2013. The statement accused Jang of freeing \\"the undesirable and alien elements, including those who had been dismissed and relieved of their posts after being severely punished for disobeying the instructions of Kim Jong Il and 'let them work in the WPK CC [Korean Workers' Party Central Committee] Administrative Department and organs under it in a crafty manner, which some analysts claim indicates that Jang had instigated a nationwide amnesty in January 2012 which included the closure of several North Korea prison camps and the release of prisoners. An analyst suggested that \\"since most of the political prisoners freed at that time are now deemed as Jang's factionists, most of them are likely to be returned to jail again\\". The statement accused Jang of bringing \\"serious harm to the youth movement in the DPRK, being part of the group of renegades and traitors in the field of youth work, bribed by the enemies\\". An analyst believes that Choe Ryong-hae, \\"the party-appointed shepherd of the North Korean youth for over a decade\\" through his position in the Kim Il-sung Socialist Youth League, linked Jang to this crime. The statement accused Jang of seeking to enlarge his own power, \\"stretching his tentacles to all ministries and national institutions\\" and turning the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee Administration Department, which Jang led, into a \\"little kingdom which no one dares touch\\"; Kim Jong-un disbanded the Administrative Department after Jang's fall. The statement also said that Jang had \\"systematically denied the party line and policies, its organizational will\\" as if he were \\"a special being who could overrule either issues decided by the party or its line\\" and that Jang had been \\"disobeying the order of the Supreme Commander of the KPA\\" (i.e. undermining Kim's rule). He was also accused of undermining the Kim personality cult, which included placing a granite monument carved with the supreme leader's words \\"in a shaded corner\\"; letting \\"the decadent capitalist lifestyle find its way to our society by distributing all sorts of pornographic pictures among his confidants\\"; and \\"half-heartedly clapping, touching off towering resentment of our service personnel and people\\" when one of Kim Jong-un's promotions was announced.\\"North Korea Says Kim's Uncle Executed\\", The New York Times, 12 December 2013.Alastair Gale, \\"What North Korea Said About Jang Song Thaek\\", The Wall Street Journal, 13 December 2013.

Korea executes leader's uncle for 'treason': KCNA\\" 13 December 2013. Chinese media and North Korea experts suggested that Jang Song-thaek's fall reflected a rejection of his efforts to prioritize economic development, and a victory for North Korean advocates of a military-first policy. Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University, said Jang was \\"the only one in the North who could talk about economic change. So, when I heard of Mr. Jang's execution, my first thought was that it was a death notice for those of us who have hoped for economic reform in the North.\\"Choe Sang-hun, \\"Grasping for Clues in North Korean Execution\\", The New York Times, 14 December 2013. Retrieved 4 January 2014. Analysts of North Korean politics agreed that Jang's execution was the most significant since purges carried out in the 1950s by Kim Il-Sung, Kim Jong-un's grandfather and North Korea's founder; since 1960, purged top officials have not usually been killed, and the denunciations of purged figures have not typically been so extreme and public.Ed Flanagan, \\"Execution of Kim Jong Un's uncle recalls grandfather's lethal era\\", NBC News, 13 December 2013.Rose Kim, \\"Execution sign of a regime on the edge\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 December 2013. Professor Charles K. Armstrong, an expert on North Korea at Columbia University, stated that \\"although high- ranking leaders, including members of the Kim family, have been deposed before, we haven't seen anything this public or dramatic since Kim Jong-un's grandfather Kim Il-sung purged his last major rivals in the late 1950s. This seems to indicate the divisions within the Kim regime were more serious than previously thought.\\" Former U.S. National Security Council director for Asian affairs Victor Cha said that the purge and execution of Jang \\"tells you that everything's not normal ... When you take out Jang, you're not taking out just one person ‚Äì you're taking out scores if not hundreds of other people in the system. It's got to have some ripple effect.\\" On the other hand, some analysts suggested that Jang's influence and role had been exaggerated. The South Korean ambassador and political science professor Moon Chung-in noted that there had been no policy shifts in the North Korean government and that some of Jang's closest associates, including Pak Pong-ju and Kang Sok-ju, had kept their positions. He also noted that Kim Jong-un's cabinet continued to emphasize economic incentive systems, innovation, and economic cooperation with China. Dr. Moon said that \\"He [Jang] could, therefore, have been purged and executed because of his obsession with material and organizational interests that challenged Kim Jong Un's reform initiative to streamline the country's economic management. If this turns out to be true, then Kim Jong Un should be seen as a reformer, whilst Jang was a reactionary.\\" In another analysis he stressed that Jang's removal had not weakened the government, which was actually more stable than before: \\"The politics of extensive surveillance, control, fear and intimidation are still alive and well. The party, the state, the military and security apparatus remain committed, effective and unified in purpose.

Two days later, on 14 December, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released a roster of six top officials appointed to a national committee in charge of organizing a state funeral for Kim Kuk-tae (a former Workers' Party official who recently died). The roster included the names of Jang's widow (Kim Jong-un's aunt), Kim Kyong-hui, and vice-premier, Ro Du-chol, indicating both survived the purge and remained in favor.Choe Sang-hun, \\"Kim Jong-un's Aunt Appears to Survive Husband's Purge\\", The New York Times, 15 December 2013.Reuters, \\"Kim Jong-un's aunt retains position of influence after husband's downfall\\", 15 December 2013. KCNA and Rodong Sinmun began erasing references to Jang \\"as completely as possible\\", deleting some 100,000 and 20,000 news items from their websites, respectively. The status of Kim Kyong-hui's relationship with Jang had been a subject of frequent speculation. Analysts believe that Jang and Kim Kyong-hui had been estranged. Yoon Sang-hyun, a National Assembly of South Korea deputy floor leader of the governing Saenuri Party, had said previously that Kim had been \\"separated\\" from Jang and did not oppose his purge. Following the execution, Chosun Ilbo reported that Choe Ryong-hae may now be the \\"number 2-man\\" in North Korea.

He was most noted for his actions during the First Battle of Ypres, when he organized impromptu forces to slow down the German assault. In 1917‚Äì18 he commanded XXI Corps in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Early life Bulfin was born Woodtown Park, Rathfarnham, Co Dublin the second son of Patrick Bulfin and Teresa Clare Carroll. His father was a son of Edward Bulfin from Derrinlough, King's County (now County Offaly), and was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1870. He was educated at Stonyhurst College, and then at Kensington Catholic Public School Although he attended Trinity College, Dublin, he did not take a degree, choosing a military career instead. Military career From Dublin University he entered the Armagh Militia from where he was commissioned into the Princess of Wales's Own (Yorkshire Regiment) in 1884, following militia service with the Royal Irish Fusiliers. He was dispatched to India on 31 December 1889, and first saw active service in Burma in that year. He was promoted to captain on 30 January 1895. In 1898 he was appointed Garrison Adjutant at Dover, and in November embarked for South Africa with his fellow Irishman General Sir William Butler, as Assistant Military Secretary. When the Second Boer War broke out, in 1899 he was appointed Brigade Major to the 9th Brigade. He saw action at several skirmishes in South Africa, and was promoted to a brevet major in November 1900. He was present at several battles including Belmont and Graspan, Modder River, Magersfontein, Rhenoster and Lindley. He returned to the regular rank of Captain in his regiment on 12 December 1901, and served in South Africa until the end of the war, when he left Cape Town on board the SS Walmer Castle in late June 1902, arriving at Southampton the following month. On his return to England he received a brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the South Africa honours list published on 26 June 1902, and abandoned regimental soldiering in favour of a staff career. From 1902 to 1904, he served as deputy assistant adjutant-general with I Corps, and from 1906 to 1910 as assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general for Cape Colony. After returning to England, he was promoted to colonel and given command of the Essex Brigade, an unusual appointment as Bulfin had never commanded a battalion. In 1913, he was promoted again, and appointed to the prestigious command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade. From 1914 to 1939 he was Regimental Colonel of Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own (Yorkshire Regiment). World War I At the outbreak of World War I Bulfin and the 2nd Brigade were transported to the Western Front as part of the original British Expeditionary Force. During the fighting around Ypres at the end of October 1914, he organized an impromptu force of six battalions (known as \\"Bulfin's force\\") and led a counterattack to stem the German advance. This action won him considerable praise from 1st Corps commander Douglas Haig, as well as BEF commander John French. In December, he was promoted to command the newly formed 28th Division, and led this formation through the heavy German gas attacks at the 2nd Battle of Ypres, and also at the Battle of Loos. Bulfin fell ill in October 1915, and spent the first half of 1916 recuperating in England, thus avoiding a transfer to Salonika. He returned to the Western Front in June 1916 to command the 60th Division during the Battle of the Somme, although the division did not play a significant role in the offensive. =Salonika and Palestine= Bulfin, third from right, with other generals on the Mount of Olives, Jerusalem, 19 March 1918 In December 1916, 60th Division was transferred to Salonika, although they remained for only six months and took part in no serious fighting. Moving to Palestine in June 1917, Bulfin was promoted to lieutenant-general and given command of XXI Corps. He proved a capable corps commander, leading his formation through Ottoman defenses at the Third Battle of Gaza, opening the way for the capture of Jerusalem. He later commanded the corps in the overwhelming victory at the Battle of Megiddo in the waning days of the war. Post war After the armistice, Bulfin remained in the army in a variety of staff positions, gaining a promotion to full general in 1925 and finally retiring in 1926. His first position was to remain in the Middle East and Egypt in particular. During the Egyptian revolution of 1919 he was known to be a very effective military leader in putting down the unrest especially through organising 'flying columns'. In the summer of 1920 he was offered the job of Chief of Police and Head of Secret Intelligence in Ireland based on his loyalty to the Crown, his Irish origins and his swift handling of the nationalist unrest in Egypt in 1919. Bulfin refused the appointment on the grounds that as a Catholic and an Irishman it would be distasteful to him to do any work which was not of a purely military character. He died in 1939 at his home in Boscombe, Bournemouth, Dorset. Family He married Mary Frances Lonergan in 1898 (immediately prior to posting to South Africa), with whom he had two children.

A popular domestic pigeon breed, the Racing Homer is also one of the newest. Development Racing pigeons were first developed in Belgium and England during the nineteenth century. They are the result of crossing of a number of other breeds, primarily the Smerle, French Cumulet, English Carrier, Dragoon, and the Horseman (now lost). From the high-flying Cumulet, the Homer received its endurance and its ability to fly for hours on end without tiring. From the Carrier, it inherited the ability to find its way home from great distances. History Pigeons have been used to carry messages for centuries. However, during the Nineteenth Century, the communication value of the bird‚Äîespecially for carrying messages during war‚Äîbecame appreciated. Breeders competed to develop ever faster birds. Competitions soon developed, with pigeon racing growing into a popular sport throughout Western Europe and, beginning in the early Twentieth Century, in the United States. Large purses are offered for race winners. All participants in World War I made use of the Racing Homer's ability to carry messages, with the British alone employing approximately 9,500 birds. The Second World War once more saw the major powers make use of the homing pigeon. Other uses Apart from the sport of racing against each other, fanciers also exhibit racing pigeons at organised shows and have a judge decide who has the better bird. British Homing World holds a show each year where all profits from the event are donated to both national and local charities, including Help the Aged and the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus. Over the years, the racing pigeon has led to a number of other breeds, such as the American Show Racer, the Giant Homer (bred for utility meat purposes), among others. In the news In February 2008 a pigeon fancier paid a South African record R800,000 for a racing pigeon at auction. The auction, where he bought several other birds, was held after the Sun City Million Dollar Pigeon Race. A pigeon was in the headlines in 1998 when its owner gave her to a friend in Algeciras, southern Spain, after retiring from breeding racing pigeons. The bird named Boomerang promptly flew the 1,200 miles back home. The bird was given away again but kept returning home. In 2008, after ten years away, the bird returned once again.

Hagere Selam was occupied 11 December 1936 by a column of the Italian Laghi Division which advanced south from Aleta Wendo. The Italians renamed the town Hula, in order to avoid Amharic names. Within a few years the Guidi described the town as an important market for coffee, hides, and cattle. Amenities included the Vice residenza, telegraph, infirmary, restaurant, and spacci. Of the four churches in Hagere Selam, Kidane Mihret was the principal one. The Italians started construction of a mosque at this time.

Uranium totaling 3.5 million pounds (1600 metric tons) of U3O8 was produced from 1950 until the mines closed in 1968. Cameron district Navajo prospector Hosteen Nez found uranium near Cameron in Coconino County in 1950. The uranium is in the Kayenta Formation and the Chinle Formation. Production was from 1950 to 1963, and totaled 1.2 million pounds (540 metric tons) of U3O8. Collapse breccia pipes Uranium was discovered in the Orphan copper mine near the south rim of the Grand Canyon in 1950. The mine has been private property since 1906, and is today completely surrounded by Grand Canyon National Park. The discovery led to the finding of uranium in other collapse breccia pipes in northern Arizona. The breccia pipes were formed when overlying rocks collapsed into caverns formed in the Mississippian Redwall Limestone. The pipes are typically in diameter, and may extend up to vertically. Sierra Ancha district Uranium mining started in 1953 from deposits in the Precambrian Dripping Spring Quartzite in Gila County. The uranium mineral is most commonly uraninite, which occurs with pyrite, marcasite, and chalcopyrite. The orebodies are in veins or strataform deposits within one-half mile of diabase intrusions.A.P. Butler Jr. and V.P. Byers (1969) Uranium, in Mineral and Water Resources of Arizona, Arizona Bureau of Mines, Bulletin 180, p.288. Date Creek Basin The Anderson uranium deposit was discovered in 1955 by an airborne gamma-radiation survey. Small amounts of ore were produced from 1955 to 1959. Uranium is associated with organic material in carbonaceous Miocene siltstones and mudstones of lacustrine and paludal origin of the Chapin Wash formation of the Date Creek Basin in Yavapai, La Paz, and Mohave counties.Andreas Mueller and Peter Halbach, The Anderson mine (Arizona)-an early diagenetic uranium deposit in Miocene lake sediments, Economic Geology, Mar.-Apr. 1983, p.2475-292. The Anderson mine is now owned by Concentric Energy Corp. which is doing extensive development work to bring it into production. Porphyry copper byproduct For some years starting in 1980, the Twin Buttes copper mine in Pima County recovered uranium as a byproduct from leach solutions recovering copper from waste material.Robert B. Scarborough (1981) Radioactive Occurrences and Uranium Production in Arizona, US Dept. of Energy, GJBX-143(81), p.93. Uranium mining and native people After the end of World War II, the United States encouraged uranium mining to build nuclear weapons stockpiles. Large uranium deposits were found on and near the Navajo Reservation, and mining companies hired many Navajos. Disregarding the health risks of radiation exposure, the private companies and the United States Atomic Energy Commission failed to inform the Navajo workers about the dangers and to regulate the mining to minimize contamination. As more data was collected, they were slow to take appropriate action for the workers. Studies show that the Navajo mine workers and numerous families on the reservation have suffered high rates of disease from environmental contamination, but for decades, industry and the government failed to regulate or improve conditions, or inform workers of the dangers. As high rates of illness began to occur, workers were often unsuccessful in court cases seeking compensation, and the states at first did not officially recognize radon illness. In 1990 the US Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, to settle such cases and provide needed compensation. In 2008 the US Congress authorized a five-year, multi-agency cleanup of uranium contamination on the Navajo Nation reservation; identification and treatment of contaminated water and structures has been the first priority. Certain water sources have been closed, and numerous contaminated buildings have been taken down. By the summer of 2011, EPA had nearly completed the first major project of removal of 20,000 cubic yards of contaminated earth from the Skyline Mine area. Current activity There are currently no producing uranium mines in Arizona. Denison Mines planned to begin mining its Arizona One mine in 2007.Denison Mines, Arizona Strip uranium project, PDF file. The deposit is in a breccia pipe on the Colorado Plateau of northern Arizona.N. Niemuth, \\"Arizona,\\" Mining Engineering, May 2007, p.70. In March 2011, the State of Arizona issued air and water permits to Denison which would allow uranium mining to resume at three locations north of the Grand Canyon, subject to federal approval.http://www.kpho.com/arizona/27163219/detail.html As of May 2015, Energy Fuels was preparing to mine uranium at its Canyon mine, a deposit on US Forest Service land, six miles from the south rim of the Grand Canyon. The deposit was discovered in the 1970s, and partially developed as an underground mine under a Forest Service permit in the late 1980s, but never put into production. The Canyon deposit holds enough ore to yield an estimated 1.63 million pounds of uranium concentrate U3O8. A coalition of groups, including the Havasupai Tribe, the Sierra Club, the Grand Canyon Trust, and the Center for Biological Diversity, sued the Forest Service to stop the reactivation of the mine. In April 2015 the US District Court for the District of Arizona ruled in favor of the Forest Service and Energy Fuels, and allowed work on the mine to proceed.‚ÄúFederal court rejects challenge to Energy Fuels Canyon mine,‚Äù Engineering & Mining Journal, 9 May 2015. The plaintiffs plan to appeal.Miriam Wasser, ‚ÄúArizona uranium mine decision appealed by pllaintiiffs,‚Äù Phoenix New Times, 1 May 2015. Energy Fuels has also been developing its Pine Nut mine located north of the Grand Canyon since 1986. Ban on uranium mining near Grand Canyon National Park In July 2009 Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced a two-year ban on new mining on federal land in an area of approximately surrounding Grand Canyon National Park. Although the ban is on all mining, the main effect is on exploration and development of breccia-pipe uranium deposits. Those claims on which commercial mineral deposits have already been discovered are exempt from the ban. During the two-year ban the Department of the Interior will study a proposed 20-year ban on new mining in the area.\\"Two-year ban on mining near Grand Canyon imposed,\\" Mining Engineering, September 2009, p.7. In January 2012, secretary Ken Salazar approved a 20-year ban on mining around the Grand Canyon. This decision preserves about ‚Äú1 million acres near the Grand Canyon, an area known to be rich in high-grade uranium ore reserves‚Äù and has generated a number of different responses The ban is supported by the president of the League of Conservation voters, Gene Karpinski: \\"Extending the current moratorium on new uranium mining claims will protect drinking water for millions downstream.‚Äù Many environmental groups agree that such mining would endanger the Colorado River as a source of water not only for wildlife, but for tens of millions of people; Phoenix, Las Vegas and Los Angeles rely on the river for drinking water. With areas of contamination already noted in United States environmental impact reports on old mining operations, opposition fears that allowing mining to expand and continue would increase the levels of contamination in the river. Supporters of the mining around the Grand Canyon argue that large-scale contamination from accidents involving mining are unlikely. According to an Arizona Geological survey, ‚Äú60 metric tons of dissolved uranium is naturally carried by the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon in an average year\\". J.E. Spencer, AZGS Senior Geologist, argues that in one hypothetical, worst-case scenario experiment, a truck carrying ‚Äúthirty metric tons (66,000 pounds) of one-percent uranium ore‚Äù spilling and washing into the Colorado River increases the natural uranium level in the river by an insignificant amount. Providing further data on uranium levels in the Colorado River, a 2010 United States Geological survey found that the river carries about 40 to 80 tons through the canyon each year. In 2011 more than 200 Arizona small businesses addressed postcards to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar sign the 20-year ban on new uranium mining near the Grand Canyon, to preserve thousands of tourism-related jobs. President of the League of Conservation voters Gene Karpinski agreed that protecting the tourism industry, which relies on the Grand Canyon, is more economically important than mining near the canyon. Coconino County Supervisor Carl Taylor argued that Uranium mining poses a great threat to tourism in the canyon and surrounding areas. Some believe that one mining accident could be destructive for tourism in the highly popular park. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar states that ‚Äúthe Grand Canyon attracts more than 4 million visitors a year and generates an estimated $3.5 billion in economic activity‚Äù. Salazar also stated that people from the United States and even all over the world come to visit and see the Grand Canyon. He believes that allowing mining in this area to be pursued would negatively impact this tourism industry. Some argue that not allowing the mining to occur destroys years of resource development. Hal Quinn, president and CEO of the National Mining Association states that banning mining in the Grand Canyon only deprives the United States of energy and minerals that are critical to the survival and strength of the US economy. The mining industry agrees, believing that a ban on mining around the Grand Canyon would negatively impact Arizona's local economy and the United States‚Äô energy independence. Jonathan DuHamel states that a permanent ban on mining would eliminate hundreds of potential jobs. Former presidential candidate John McCain argues that opposition to the mining provoked by environmental groups who have the goal of killing mining and grazing jobs throughout Arizona. The increasing number of claims that began in 2006 was a direct result of the rising uranium prices that began that year. Higher uranium prices encouraged mining companies to locate and mine new deposits around the canyon area. In 2011, when the price of uranium lowered about 35%, companies continued to explore the area.

Along with George Kaye, he was one of the founding editors of the reference book Tables of Physical and Chemical Constants and Some Mathematical Functions, usually known simply as \\"Kaye and Laby\\". Early life Born in Creswick, Victoria, Australia, Laby moved with his family to New South Wales around 1883. Laby's father, Thomas James Laby, a flour-miller, died in 1888. After some schooling at country schools and private study, Laby joined the Taxation Department in 1898 but soon gained a position in the chemical laboratory of the Department of Agriculture. Career In 1901 Laby obtained a position of junior demonstrator in chemistry at the University of Sydney. He took evening classes at the University and soon had two papers published by the Royal Society of New South Wales: 'The separation of iron from nickel and cobalt' in 1903 and 'Preliminary observations on radio- activity and the occurrence of radium in Australian minerals' with Sir Douglas Mawson in 1904. In 1905 Laby went to England to study under Sir J. J. Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. There he received a Bachelor of Arts degree by theses on the ionization produced by alpha- particles and on the supersaturation and nuclear condensation of organic vapours. He also met Ernest Rutherford there, who became a friend. Laby was appointed to the new chair of physics at Victoria University College in Wellington, New Zealand in 1909 and completed work with George Kaye resulting in publication of Tables of physical and chemical constants with some mathematical functions (London, 1911); the title has had sixteen editions as of 2007. Laby was president of section A of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science in Melbourne, 1912. Laby had married in 1914 and the next year was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy at the University of Melbourne. He developed valves for an anti-gas respirator, performed radiographic testing of fuses and inspected X-ray equipment for military hospitals. Laby was awarded a Doctor of Science by the University of Cambridge in 1921 and carried on his research, mainly into heat and X-ray spectroscopy. He was Commonwealth adviser in Radium at the Commonwealth Radium Laboratory when it was established in 1929 on university grounds. In 1927 he joined the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's Australian Radio Research Board. In 1924 Laby was president of the Royal Society of Victoria, in 1931 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, in 1939 was inaugural president of the Australian Institute of Physics and chairman of the Optical Munitions Panel 1940-44. Late life Laby had suffered from low blood pressure and asthma, he died on 21 June 1946 of arteriosclerosis. He was survived by his wife and two daughters. Honours In 1976 he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post .

He served as the official Church Historian and Recorder of the church from 2005 to 2012. He was the 19th man to hold that calling since it was established in 1830. Jensen was made an emeritus general authority in the October 2012 general conference.  Biographical background  Jensen was born in Huntsville, Utah. As a 19-year-old, he served as a missionary for the LDS Church in West Germany. After returning home in 1964, he graduated from BYU with a B.S. in German. He obtained a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Utah College of Law in 1970, graduating first in his class. At the relatively young age of 28, he served as bishop of his ward in Huntsville, as had both his father and grandfather. He later served as president of the Huntsville Utah Stake. In 1987 he became a regional representative for the Kaysville Utah and Layton Utah regions. Jensen married Kathleen Bushnell on June 9, 1967 in the Salt Lake Temple. They are the parents of eight children. Professionally, Jensen was an attorney in private practice in Ogden, Utah, specializing in business and estate planning. This supported his real passion of living a farming lifestyle. His family operates a ranching enterprise called Jensens' Middle Fork Ranch, in which he is a partner. In August 2012, Utah Governor Gary Herbert nominated Jensen to serve on the Utah State Board of Regents, which oversees the state's colleges and universities.http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865560066/Former-LDS-Church- leaders-tabbed-for-Utah-higher-education-boards.html  General authority  In 1989, Jensen became a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy at the age of 46.. In 1993, he was made assistant executive director of the church's Priesthood Department, later becoming executive director until 2001. From 1993 to 1995, while a general authority, Jensen served as president of the church's New York Rochester Mission. In 1995, Jensen became a member of the church's Public Affairs Committee. From 1996 to 1998 he was executive director of the Church Historical Department. He served in the First Quorum of the Seventy until 1998, when he became a member of the Presidency of the Seventy, and in 2000 he also became the general president of the church's Sunday School. Jensen served in these positions until 2001. In 2004, he replaced D. Todd Christofferson as executive director of the Family and Church History Department, a position he held previously when it was just the Historical Department. In 2005, he became the first Church Historian and Recorder to serve since 1997. He served in this capacity until 2012 and was designated an emeritus general authority in October 2012. Jensen is one of the few general authorities of the LDS Church who self-identifies as a member of the Democratic Party. =Area Presidencies= Jensen has served in various area presidency positions. As a new Seventy in 1989, he was counselor to John K. Carmack, president of the Utah Central Area. From 1990 to 1992, Jensen served as president of the Utah North Area. He later served first as a counselor, then as president, of the North America Northeast Area. He was president of the Europe Central Area from 2001 to 2003. =Church Historian= Jensen was Church Historian and Recorder from 2005 to 2012, and executive director of the Church History Department from 2004 to 2012. In these roles and as a church official, Jensen has spoken at General Conference, BYU Women's Conference (1998), BYU Family History and Genealogy Conference (2006), Northern Utah Family History Conference (2006), Yale's American Society of Church History (2007), and the Mormon History Association Conference (2005 and 2007). Jensen has also notably attended various conferences, including the Library of Congress' Worlds of Joseph Smith Symposium (2005) and UVSC's Mormon Studies Conference (2008). Not a trained historian or academic, Jensen brought a passion to his work; reading widely, gathering scholars, and implementing changes. Observers reported that his contributions \\"helped transform the Utah- based faith's approach to its history,\\" and saw the church's history department \\"truly come of age.\\" Terryl Givens said of his legacy, \\"Marlin Jensen has done more to further the cause of Mormon history than any person of the current generation.\\" Several major developments occurred during Jensen's leadership over the Church History Department. *Joseph Smith Papers Project: In 2001, the LDS Church and BYU created the Joseph Smith Papers Project, intended to revise and expand on the longtime work of Dean C. Jessee to collect and publish all known writings of Joseph Smith. Under Jensen, the project expanded into a 30-some volume, multi-year effort endorsed by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission of the National Archives. In 2005, Jensen said this was \\"the single most significant historical project of our generation\\". *Church History Library: Plans were finalized in 2005 to build a new , 5 floor building near Temple Square to house the church archives and history department staff. It was opened to the general public in June 2009. *Researchers return to archives: From 1980‚Äì1982, the church moved the History Division of the Historical Department to Provo, Utah, to become the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History at BYU. In late 2004, discussions began about returning researchers to the LDS Archives to increase pace and reduce costs in the Joseph Smith Papers Project. In June 2005, the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute was closed and the staff moved back to the Church Office Building, and in 2009 relocated again to the new Church History Library. *Church Historian's Press: On February 25, 2008, a new imprint called the Church Historian's Press was announced as the long- awaited publisher for the Joseph Smith Papers. Jensen mentioned the press could be used to publish George Q. Cannon's journals or other documentary works, and perhaps someday narrative histories and biographies that make use of the Church Archives. *Separate department: On March 12, 2008, the Family and Church History Department was divided into the Family History Department and the Church History Department. *New Assistant Church Historian called: On March 12, 2008, when the Church History Department was formed, Richard Turley was called as the first Assistant Church Historian since Davis Bitton was released in 1982. *Mountain Meadows: At the 2007 sesquicentennial of the Mountain Meadows massacre, descendants of the victims petitioned the LDS Church to secure landmark status for its holdings at the Mountain Meadows site. On March 28, 2008, Jensen addressed these families and said the LDS Church would seek National Historic Landmark designation for these properties, which was granted in 2011. He worked to strengthen relationships with the victims' descendants and encouraged publication of a new \\"no-holds-barred\\" history, coauthored by Jensen's Assistant, Richard Turley. * Technological modernization: Thousands of the LDS Church's historical documents were mass digitized and made freely available online, including the Joseph Smith Papers. Historian Jan Shipps called this \\"a change that is so epochal it would be very hard to turn it back.\\" In addition to developing a new church-wide system for digitally collecting and managing records, the Church History Library's searchable catalog was made available online. A five-year plan was developed for using technology to preserve and share LDS history. * International history: The Church History Department decentralized its collecting of international church history. Church Historians were called for individual Areas and countries, and oral histories were to be gathered from mission presidents and area presidents when they were released. Before this time, little had been done to gather international church history. Jensen saw this project as \\"one of the significant accomplishments in this period of time.\\" * Historical professionalism: Jensen worked to make the Church History Department authoritative and trusted within the LDS Church, as well as by \\"historians who write from different points of view\\". Jensen strained to make archive materials more publicly available and to set the tone of \\"unflinching honesty ... for a whole new generation of LDS academics.\\" He attended academic conferences and was the first LDS general authority at the Mormon History Association annual meeting. In January 2012, it was announced that, after a transition period, Steven E. Snow would replace Jensen as the Church Historian and Recorder later in the year. Snow succeeded Jensen on August 1, 2012. On October 6, 2012, Jensen was then released from the First Quorum of the Seventy and designated as an emeritus general authority at the LDS Church's semi- annual general conference. LDS Church practice is to release Seventies from service following their 70th birthdays, which Jensen had observed in May of that year.  Major statements  Jensen at times addressed the press or public as a church representative. He often acted as a peacemaker, attempting to bring understanding or empathy to divisive issues. While not always official church positions, his statements illustrated his candid views as a leader within the LDS Church. =Political parties= On April 22, 1998, Jensen was sent by the First Presidency to give an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune in reaction to a 1998 First Presidency statement and to explicitly state that someone could be a devout Mormon and a member of the Democratic Party. He lamented the decline of the Utah Democratic Party, and regretted that the Republican Party might be seen as the \\"church party\\". He felt that good Latter-day Saints will have conflicts with either party's platform, from which they must selectively pick and choose. Coming from a church official on assignment from the First Presidency, the comments surprised many prominent Utah politicians and Latter-day Saints. Archive of online reprint by UtahCountyDems.com =The Mormons (PBS)= Jensen featured prominently in the 2007 PBS documentary The Mormons. His March 7, 2006 interview probed a variety of subjects, including some controversial topics. *Doubt: Jensen described questioning his religion while in philosophy classes where he had to \\"test [his] belief against ... other theories.\\" This led him to reinforce his faith through deeper study. *Correlation: \\"We are really trying to take account of cultural differences and to not feel that this Utah influence or even the American influence has to be worldwide.\\" *Folklore of the priesthood ban: Jensen recalled his attempts to have the church repudiate the rationale some use to explain the priesthood ban.Jensen was asked by some LDS members in 1996 to address this problem. See: *Historical truth claims: \\"I think we take it very literally. We don't deconstruct and feel that what we have is the figment of language or our imagination, or that there is some middle ground. I know that is very polarizing. In a sense, I think the hardest public relations sell we have to make is that this is the only true church.\\" *Homosexuality: Jensen said the gospel allows either heterosexuality or celibacy. He empathized with celibate gay members, since the church cannot offer them hope of eventually finding love in this life as it can with single heterosexuals. *Faith-promoting history: Jensen questioned whether the Church Historian should only focus on reinforcing faith, or if he should also focus on \\"objective\\" histories. *Excommunicable doctrines: Jensen mentioned that members may receive disciplinary action in supporting gay marriage or opposing Book of Mormon divinity, if they are \\"openly vocal\\" and \\"malign the leadership in the church for not adopting that position.\\" =Illegal immigrants= On February 13, 2008, Jensen urged the Utah State Legislature to show compassion in considering laws that would affect undocumented immigrants. Several bills were under debate to block undocumented access to jobs and public benefits, such as in-state tuition and driving privilege cards. On behalf of the First Presidency at Westminster College's Interfaith Dialogue on Immigration, Jensen said lawmakers should \\"take a step back\\" since this \\"deal[s] with God's children\\" and \\"a more humane approach is warranted\\". =Historical openness= In a February 25, 2008 press release about the new Church Historian's Press publishing the Joseph Smith Papers, Jensen offered instruction on how to approach church history. He asked for LDS historians to \\"not be in an apologetic mode, but to be as open, candid and fair about our own history as we can\\". They should foster a culture of mutual openness with the general historical community. Jensen observed \\"greater dialogue coming about, less suspicion and a greater openness that is coming to pass\\". =FLDS polygamy= On May 5, 2008, Jensen officially responded to Timothy Egan's New York Times op-ed piece which claimed that FLDS polygamy \\"is a look back at some of the behavior of Mormonism's founding fathers\\". Jensen strongly disagreed and pointed out that by 19th-century norms a 15-year-old bride was not unusual nor considered abused and the \\"common-law marriage age for women was 12\\". Plural marriages were \\"not controlled by the authority of one individual\\" and \\"the consent of individual women was always honored in any marriage proposal\\". In addition, many 19th-century polygamous wives were well-educated, politically active professionals.\\"Polygamy Then and Now\\", churchofjesuschrist.org, accessed 2008-05-30. =Gay marriage= On September 19, 2010, members of the Oakland, California stake were invited to share with Jensen their experiences and troubles over the LDS Church's involvement in the Proposition 8 campaign to ban gay marriage in California. After several recounted their painful experiences, Jensen responded with empathy and a personal apology, saying, \\"To the full extent of my capacity, I say that I am sorry .... I know that many very good people have been deeply hurt, and I know that the Lord expects better of us.\\"Joanna Brooks, \\"Mormon Leader: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Sorry‚Äô For Hurtful Legacy of Prop. 8\\" , Religion Dispatches, 2010-09-28. =Modern apostasy= At the invitation of Utah State University professor Philip Barlow, Jensen held a \\"Q&A;\\" with a Mormon Studies student group on November 11, 2011. Jensen was asked if church leaders were aware that members were discovering problems with LDS Church history through the internet, and what is to be done for those who may be affected or \\"who are already leaving in droves\\". Jensen responded that top church leaders \\"realize that, maybe, since Kirtland we've never had a period of, I'll call it apostasy, like we're having right now, largely over these issues.\\" He said a new church initiative would give answers to troubling questions, and such issues should be discussed more openly with the new internet-savvy generation. These remarks were recorded by a student and circulated online, and were picked up in a Reuters \\"Special Report\\". Jensen later clarified that critics were overstating his remarks, saying \\"To say we are experiencing some Titanic-like wave of apostasy is inaccurate.\\" Publications =Articles=      =General Conference addresses=  * =Interviews=   Notes  External links * General Authorities and General Officers: Elder Marlin K.

In a phase of construction of what was at first called the Ariake West Line, a track was built from (on the existing Nagasaki Main Line) north to Yue which opened on 24 March 1934 as the terminus of the track. A few months later, link up was made from Yue to (which had been extended south from ). With through traffic achieved from Hizen-Yamaguchi on the new route to Nagasaki, the entire stretch of track was designated as part of the Nagasaki Main Line on 1 December 1934.

B. F. Skinner was also influential in developing the technique, noting that, > ...errors are not necessary for learning to occur. Errors are not a function > of learning or vice versa nor are they blamed on the learner. Errors are a > function of poor analysis of behavior, a poorly designed shaping program, > moving too fast from step to step in the program, and the lack of the > prerequisite behavior necessary for success in the program. Errorless learning can also be understood at a synaptic level, using the principle of Hebbian learning (\\"Neurons that fire together wire together\\"). Many of Skinner's other students and followers continued to test the idea. In 1963, Herbert Terrace wrote a paper describing an experiment with pigeons which allows discrimination learning to occur with few or even with no responses to the negative stimulus (abbreviated S‚àí). A negative stimulus is a stimulus associated with undesirable consequences (e.g., absence of reinforcement). In discrimination learning, an error is a response to the S‚àí, and according to Terrace errors are not required for successful discrimination performance. Principles A simple discrimination learning procedure is one in which a subject learns to associate one stimulus, S+ (positive stimulus), with reinforcement (e.g. food) and another, S‚àí (negative stimulus), with extinction (e.g. absence of food). For example, a pigeon can learn to peck a red key (S+), and avoid a green key (S‚àí). Using traditional procedures, a pigeon would be initially trained to peck a red key (S+). When the pigeon was responding consistently to the red key (S+), a green key (S‚àí) would be introduced. At first the pigeon would also respond to the green key (S‚àí) but gradually responses to this key would decrease, because they are not followed by food, so that they occurred only a few times or even never. Terrace (1963) found that discrimination learning could occur without errors when the training begins early in operant conditioning and visual stimuli (S+ and S‚àí) like colors are used that differ in terms of brightness, duration and wavelength. He used a fading procedure in which the brightness and duration differences between the S+ and the S‚àí were decreased progressively leaving only the difference in wavelength. In other words, the S+ and S‚àí were initially presented with different brightness and duration, i.e., the S+ would appear for 5 s and fully red, and the S‚àí would appear for 0.5 s and dark. Gradually, over successive presentations, the duration of the S‚àí and its brightness were gradually increased until the keylight was fully green for 5 s. Studies of implicit memory and implicit learning from cognitive psychology and cognitive neuropsychology have provided additional theoretical support for errorless learning methods (e.g., Brooks and Baddeley, 1976, Tulving and Schacter, 1990). Implicit memory is known to be poor at eliminating errors, but can be used to compensate when explicit memory function is impaired. In experiments on amnesiac patients, errorless implicit learning was more effective because it reduced the possibility of errors \\"sticking\\" in amnesiacs' memories.Baddeley, A.D. and Wilson, B.A. (1994) When implicit learning fails: Amnesia and the problem of error elimination. Neuropsychologia, 32(1), 53-68. Effects The errorless learning procedure is highly effective in reducing the number of responses to the S‚àí during training. In Terrace's (1963) experiment, subjects trained with the conventional discrimination procedure averaged over 3000 S‚àí (errors) responses during 28 sessions of training; whereas subjects trained with the errorless procedure averaged only 25 S‚àí (errors) responses in the same number of sessions. Later, Terrace (1972) claimed not only that the errorless learning procedure improves long-term discrimination performance, but also that: 1) S‚àí does not become aversive and so does not elicit \\"aggressive\\" behaviors, as it often does with conventional training; 2) S‚àí does not develop inhibitory properties; 3) positive behavioral contrast to S+ does not occur. In other words, Terrace has claimed that the \\"by-products\\" of conventional discrimination learning do not occur with the errorless procedure. Limits However, some evidence suggests that errorless learning may not be as qualitatively different from conventional training as Terrace initially claimed. For example, Rilling (1977) demonstrated in a series of experiments that these \\"by-products\\" can occur after errorless learning, but that their effects may not be as large as in the conventional procedure; and Marsh and Johnson (1968) found that subjects given errorless training were very slow to make a discrimination reversal. Applications Interest from psychologists studying basic research on errorless learning declined after the 1970s. However, errorless learning attracted the interest of researchers in applied psychology, and studies have been conducted with both children (e.g., educational settings) and adults (e.g. Parkinson's patients). Errorless learning continues to be of practical interest to animal trainers, particularly dog trainers.http://stalecheerios.com/blog/wp- content/uploads/2011/07/Teaching-Dogs-the-Clicker-Way-JRR.pdf Errorless learning has been found to be effective in helping memory-impaired people learn more effectively.B. Wilson (2009) Memory Rehabilitation: Integrating Theory and Practice, The Guilford Press, 284 pages. The reason for the method's effectiveness is that, while those with sufficient memory function can remember mistakes and learn from them, those with memory impairment may have difficulty remembering not only which methods work, but may strengthen incorrect responses over correct responses, such as via emotional stimuli.

It enables X servers to \\"share\\" individual X windows or an entire desktop, thus allowing users at multiple workstations to use standard applications to collaborate in real-time in an X Window System network environment, similar to desktop sharing, but for only a single window. System A decade later, this capability would be termed \\"desktop sharing\\", with VNC being a major player. One difference between VNC and SharedX is that SharedX allows fine-grained sharing of any X window or group of X windows among any number of users, while VNC only allows sharing of the entire desktop. SharedX was conceived by Philip Gust at HP Labs, where he developed several implementations between 1986 and 1987. It was first presented and demonstrated at the 2nd Annual X Technical Conference.Philip Gust, \\"Shared X: X in a Distributed Group Work Environment,\\" presented at the 2nd Annual X Technical Conference, Boston, MA, January, 1988.

Bassett, USNR in command. Service history After loading cargo, Lesuth departed San Pedro, California, 14 November, arriving Pago Pago, Samoa, on 30 November. Four days later she arrived Funafuti, Ellice Islands and for the next 3 months engaged in training exercises in the South Pacific. = Serving South Pacific island bases = From Funafuti she steamed to the Marshall Islands, arriving Kwajalein 6 March 1944, as a unit of Service Squadron 8. Lesuth remained in the Marshall Islands until she departed Kwajalein 6 August, for Guadalcanal. She loaded cargo in the Solomons and Russell Islands, then sailed from Manus 14 September, en route to the Palau-Western Caroline campaign. = Supporting the Philippine invasion = The Palau Islands were of strategic importance as an advance base for the invasion of Leyte. The initial landings took place 15 September, 5 days before Lesuth arrived off Kossol Passage. For the next 2 months she remained off Peleliu unloading cargo needed for the Philippine assault. Sailing to Tulagi and Guadalcanal in late November, the cargo ship departed on 26 November for San Francisco, California. After overhaul, Lesuth rejoined Service Squadron 8 at Eniwetok 11 February 1945. Later that month she sailed for the Philippines, arriving San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 28 February. Following 6 weeks of cargo operations off Leyte, she steamed to the United States during May and June, for additional supplies, then returned to Ulithi 25 July. = End-of-war activity = When the Japanese surrender ended World War II, Lesuth was used to carry provisions to the occupation troops in the Far East. From September 1945 to May 1946, she made cargo runs to Japan, the Philippines, Okinawa, and Saipan, finally departing Saipan 5 May. Arriving San Francisco, California, on 24 May, Lesuth remained there until 2 July, when she sailed for Pearl Harbor.  Post-war decommissioning  She decommissioned at Pearl Harbor 16 August 1946.

Synopsis The series revolves around three childhood friends, Aldo, Zack, and Eddie. In hopes of meeting women at the Jersey Shore over the summer, they decided to get a beach house in Belmar, New Jersey. To cover expenses, they share the beach house with three female co-workers, Donna, Miranda, and Arden. At the start of the second season, Miranda was written out of the series by having a job that was too demanding, and the new female occupant of the beach house was a woman named Sammy, whom Aldo once had a fling with. Although the show was largely comedic in nature, it did have one notable episode where Aldo, a noted Lothario, had been briefly hospitalized and was awaiting the result of an AIDS test. This made all the renters of the beach home, while supportive of Aldo awaiting the results, mull over the fact that casual sex can come with an expensive price. The show ran for 29 episodes over two seasons. The first episode aired Sunday at 9:30 pm and the rest of the first season aired at 10:00 pm. The second season aired Sunday at 10:30 pm for the first two episodes and Thursday at 9:30 pm for the remaining episodes.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 for having local significance in the theme of politics/government. It was nominated as an example of the municipal services offered by small villages such as Tenney, which measured only two square blocks. In 2011 the village, which had dwindled to three residents, voted 2‚Äì1 to dissolve as a separate municipality and become part of Campbell Township. Description The Tenney Fire Hall was a wood frame building with sheet metal siding stamped with a brick pattern. The building was characterized by an oversized bell tower with a pyramidal roof and louvered windows. The fire hall originally stood as a sort of miniature version of the similarly-shaped but much larger town hall adjacent. History The Fire Hall was built in 1904 to house the town's two hand-drawn fire pumpers. The engines were used in conjunction with a large curbed well with a double stroked pump, an arrangement which was not abandoned until 1924. In 1918 the town jail was moved and added on to the rear of the fire hall, making room for a larger fire pumper. The building was used for many years as a meeting house, a polling station, and of course as a fire hall and jail. During the 1990s the private owner had hoped to preserve the fire hall and to make it a viable attraction, but his efforts were hamstrung by the state and federal regulations governing the type of actions that can be taken with regard to moving or refurbishing properties on the National Register. In the summer of 2008 an anonymous vandal crashed a vehicle into the fire hall, badly damaging the northwestern corner of the building. In 2010 the fire hall was burned to the ground. In 2016 the fire hall's original bell was installed in the offices of Myriad Mobile, an app developer, in downtown Fargo, North Dakota.

Battle of the Washita At daybreak on November 27, 1868, the 7th U.S. Cavalry under the command of Lt. Colonel George Custer attacked a Cheyenne camp of 51 lodges on the Washita River in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Custer's troops were able to take control of the village quickly, but it took longer to quell all remaining resistance.Greene 2004, pp 116-138.

One of the scouts, Raphael Romero, was sent to assure those women and children who had remained in their lodges during the attack that they would not be harmed.Green 2004, pp. 120, 189-190. A total of fifty- three women and children were taken captive. Account by White Cow Bull (Lakota) In 1938, Joseph White Cow Bull, an Oglala Lakota veteran of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, went with David Humphreys Miller to the Little Bighorn battlefield and recounted to him his recollections of the battle. Among his recollections:Miller, 1971. > While we were together in this village [on the Little Bighorn River], I > spent most of my time with the Shahiyela [Cheyenne] since I knew their > tongue and their ways almost as well as my own. In all those years I had > never taken a wife, although I had had many women. One woman I wanted was a > pretty young Shahiyela named Monahseetah, or Meotxi as I called her. She was > in her middle twenties but had never married any man of her tribe. Some of > my Shahiyela friends said she was from the southern branch of their tribe, > just visiting up north, and they said no Shahiyela could marry her because > she had a seven-year-old son born out of wedlock and that tribal law forbade > her getting married. They said the boy‚Äôs father had been a white soldier > chief named Long Hair; he had killed her father, Chief Black Kettle , in a > battle in the south [Battle of the Washita] eight winters before, they said, > and captured her. He had told her he wanted to make her his second wife, and > so he had her. But after a while his first wife, a white woman, found her > out and made him let her go. Miller asked White Cow Bull, \\"Was this boy still with her here?\\" and White Cow Bull answered: > Yes, I saw him often around the Shahiyela camp. He was named Yellow Bird and > he had light streaks in his hair. He was always with his mother in the > daytime, so I would have to wait until night to try to talk to her alone. > She knew I wanted to walk with her under a courting blanket and make her my > wife. But she would only talk with me through the tepee cover and never came > outside. Notes References * Brill, Charles J. (2002).

The study, which was commissioned by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, investigated questions about generating electricity from biomass fuel, including the net effect of biomass energy on atmospheric carbon balance. The study concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from burning wood are initially higher than from fossil fuels, but the carbon sequestered by regrowing forests can yield lower greenhouse gas levels over time. Manomet is also known for its long-term shorebird research in the Arctic. In September 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service selected Manomet to lead a $3 million, seven-month study to assess the impact on shorebirds from the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Born in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1927, Blake served in the US Army at the end of World War II and attended Wilkes College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He spent his early career promoting local boxing matches, stock car races, and baseball games. He later worked for several professional baseball and football teams, and helping to found the Continental Basketball Association.

Blake followed that selection with Italy's Dino Meneghin in the 11th round. Neither player ever signed with the Hawks, since the team could not afford to buy out their contracts, but the draft selections set the stage for the later influx of global talent into the NBA.Jerry Brewer. \\"The NBA Goes Global: Rosters Filling Up with International Talent.\\" Orlando Sentinel. 24 June 2003.

When the ABA-NBA merger occurred in 1976, Blake was named NBA Director of Scouting Services. Blake and his associates were credited with discovering such players as Jack Sikma, Terry Porter, Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippen, Tim Hardaway, Ben Wallace, Karl Malone, and Joe Dumars.

She operated out of Funafuti, and after 6 March 1944, Kwajalein, as the \\"wholesaler\\", distributing dry provisions, clothing, medical supplies, and store stock to mobile supply base craft, which in turn distributed supplies to the consumer units of the fleet. = Disembarking Material at Saipan and Tinian = Megrez returned to Pearl Harbor on 2 June 1944, and took on a cargo of rolling stock, sheet metals, and ammunition for transportation to the Marianas in support of Saipan and Tinian operations. Leaving Hawaiian waters on 19 June 1944, Megrez steamed, via Kwajalein and Eniwetok, for Saipan, arriving on 14 August 1944. Two days later, Megrez moved to Tinian where she discharged the cargo at the rate of a day. = A floating supply ship = Megrez next sailed for Eniwetok, arriving on 31 August, to become a floating supply and freight depot once again. In October she was reassigned and on her arrival at Ulithi on 14 October, she became a station ship for the issuance of lube oil to the US 3rd Fleet and the US 5th Fleet. Megrez served in this capacity for the next 7 months, supplying this vital fluid to the warships as they pressed closer to the enemy's home islands. = Supporting Philippine operations = On 13 April 1945, her tour as a floating supply center completed, Megrez departed Ulithi for Kossol Roads carrying fleet freight and general stores and supplies. She arrived in the Palau Islands on 14 April, unloaded her cargo and departed for San Pedro Bay, Philippine Islands, on 18 April. = End-of-war activity = Through September, Megrez freighted cargo among the Philippines and between San Pedro Bay and Ulithi. On 5 October 1945, she departed for Buckner Bay, Okinawa, arriving on 13 October, and then continued on to Japan on 3 November. Arriving at Yokosuka on 7 November, she then supplied ships in the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea before departing for Pearl Harbor in December 1946 ..

Major Thomas McDonnell Biography =Childhood and early life= McDonnell was born to Thomas McDonnell Sr., an early British merchant and speculator who served a brief term as Additional British Resident, and his wife Anna McDonnell (n√©e Patterson). He was born between 1831 and 1833 and raised first in Sydney, then Horeke, Northland. There he learned to speak MƒÅori and how to use the traditional taiaha weapon. He tried his luck on the Victorian goldfields from 1853 to 1855, then returned to New Zealand where he obtained a post in the Native Land Purchase Department under Alfred Domett in Auckland. After being paid eight months late, McDonnell resigned from that job and went sheepfarming in the Hawkes Bay with his brother William, only to be defrauded by a third party. He returned to Auckland in 1862 and was appointed interpreter to the resident magistrate at Thames, panning for gold on the side. =New Zealand Wars= Through Alfred Domett, McDonnell obtained a commission in the Colonial Defence Force as a sub-inspector in 1863. During this time McDonnell served in the Invasion of the Waikato, seeing action at the battles of Rangiaowhia and Hairini. He was promoted to Captain in 1864.  Tƒ´tokowaru's War  Following the end of the conflict in the Waikato, McDonnell took command of the colonial forces at Patea in 1866.

Career Brooklyn-born Schindell was born Seymour Schindel in 1907. He was a former middleweight boxer with 19 fights from 1926‚Äì1928.Cy Schindel He was later bitten by the acting bug, and found work as an extra at Columbia Studios, most notably appearing with comedy team the Three Stooges. A skilled stuntman, Schindell performed many pratfalls himself. His ability to deliver straight, tough dialogue (\\"youse mugs\\") made him a natural for parts as heavies. Shorts like Calling All Curs, Nutty But Nice and Fright Night gave Schindell a chance to bully the Stooges around to great effect. In Matri-Phony and Fright Night the ex-pugilist was knocked cold by the trio, only to have the Stooges (concealed behind a curtain) maneuver the unconscious Schindell like a puppet (when Fright Night was remade in 1955 as Fling in the Ring, this footage was reused). Schindell also memorably played Chizzilini, a parody of Benito Mussolini, in the short I'll Never Heil Again. In addition to his work in Three Stooges shorts, Schindell also appeared briefly in It's a Wonderful Life as the bouncer at Nick's, and made numerous film appearances playing mainly blue collar roles such as a truck driver, a butcher and a policeman. Military service and illness Schindell enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during the 1920sThe Leatherneck, Volume 11 Marine Corps Institute, 1928 and returned to active service for World War II. While on Guadalcanal, he developed a severe case of jungle rot, which eventually developed into terminal cancer. Knowing he was dying, Schindell worked constantly during his illness to assure his family would be financially secure after his death.

In Indiana, it is a State Road that enters the state in College Corner, Ohio, and West College Corner, Indiana. The of US 27 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. Most of the highway is listed on the National Highway System. Various sections are rural two-lane highway, urbanized four-lane divided highway. The northernmost community along the highway is Fort Wayne in the northeast part of the state. The highway ends at an interchange with Interstate 69 (I‚Äì69) north of downtown Fort Wayne after serving the east central and northeast regions of Indiana. US 27 passes through farm fields and urban areas, and parallel to the Ohio state line. The highway is included in the Gene Stratton Memorial Highway. Historical landmarks along the highway include the Levi Coffin House, Portland Commercial Historic District and the Allen County Court House. US 27 was first designated as a US Highway in 1926. US 27 replaced the original SR 48, SR 21, and SR 46 designations of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana State Road system. SR 46 ran from Ohio State line to Liberty and SR 21 ran from Liberty through Richmond to Portland ending in Fort Wayne. SR 46 ran from Auburn to Angola. Realignments and construction projects have expanded the highway to four lanes in Adams and Allen counties. Route description Looking north on Meridian Street (U.S. Route 27) from Main Street in downtown Portland US 27 enters Indiana heading northwest from Ohio, parallel to CSX railroad track, in the town of West College Corner. In West College Corner the highway passes through the center of town, on a street named Liberty Avenue. The route continues northwest towards Liberty, as a two-lane rural highway passing through farmland. On the way to Liberty the road passes through Cottage Grove and crosses the Indiana Eastern Railroad. In Liberty the highway has an all-way stop at SR 44, this intersection is the southern end of the SR 44 concurrency. In the center of Liberty the two road end the concurrency at a traffic light with SR 101, with US 27 heading north, SR 44 heading west and SR 101 heading south. US 27 leaves Liberty heading due north as a two-lane rural highway. The road enters Richmond from the south, with a series of curves and a traffic light at SR 227. US 27 and SR 227 begin a concurrency at this traffic light and both routes head north, heading for downtown Richmond. The concurrency passes over the Indiana Eastern Railroad tracks, as a four-lane undivided road. In downtown Richmond the roadway becomes one-way streets, begins after O street, with northbound on ninth street and southbound of eighth street. The two street head straight through downtown passing residential areas, before reaching commercial areas. At C Street the one-way pairs end and the road passes over Norfolk Southern railroad tracks. After the railroad tracks the concurrency with SR 227 ends with SR 227 heading northeast. US 27 continues northerly as a four-lane undivided highway. The road leaves Richmond having a single-point urban interchange, with Interstate 70 (I‚Äì70) and US 35. The route heads northwest from Richmond towards Portland, as a two-lane rural highway passing through farmland with a few houses. The road passes through Fountain City and passed the Levi Coffin House, a building on the National Historic Landmark list. The highway passes through Lynn and then has an intersection with US 36. North of US 36 the highway heads towards Winchester. The road passes Winchester on the east side. While in Winchester US 27 pass a mix of commercial, residential and farmland, the route also has an interchange with SR 32. The road begins a concurrency with SR 26 south of the Portland Commercial Historic District, a historic district that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The concurrency passes through the historic district as a four-lane road with a center turn lane. North of the historic district the concurrency with SR 26 ends and a concurrency with SR 67 begins. After SR 26, the two route head through commercial properties, with a few houses, as a two-lane street with a center turn lane. The concurrency heads north leaving Portland as a two-lane rural highway, passing through farmland with a few houses. The concurrency enters Bryant and on the north side of town the concurrency ends with SR 67. The route has a traffic-light at SR 124 west of Monroe. At this traffic light the road becomes a four-lane divided highway, heading north towards Fort Wayne. On the way to Fort Wayne, the route passes through Decatur and at a traffic light a concurrency with US 33 begins. As the two highways head farther into Decatur US 224 joins the other two routes in a concurrency with three routes. US 224 leaves the concurrency heading due west for Huntington. The other two routes continue north-northwest leaving Decatur and heading for Fort Wayne. Northern terminus of US 27 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The concurrency with US 33 ends at a diamond interchange with I‚Äì469 on the south side of Fort Wayne. North of I‚Äì469, the road becomes known as Decatur Road and continues northwest passing through farmland with houses. The name of the road changes to Lafayette Street at a traffic light with Anthony Boulevard. North of this traffic light the road enters commercial areas followed by residential areas. The road becomes a four-lane undivided highway north of Pettit Avenue. The route becomes one-way pairs at McKinnie Avenue with northbound on Lafayette Street and Spy Run Avenue and southbound is on Clinton Street. Both One-way streets pass under the Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad and enters downtown Fort Wayne. In downtown the streets past near the Allen County Court House and Parkview Field.

The interchange at I‚Äì69 is the northern terminus of US 27, Lima Road continues north as SR 3 towards Kendallville. The entire length of U.S. Route 27 in Indiana is included in the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other U.S. Highways in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 3,090 vehicles and 580 commercial vehicles used the highway daily from SR 28 to Jay County line. The peak traffic volumes were 41,790 vehicles and 2,570 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of US 27 just north of downtown Fort Wayne. History The original route of US 27 was signed as three different state roads in 1918. Old SR 48 from Ohio state line to Liberty, Old SR 48 headed west on what is now known as SR 44. The section was from Liberty to Fort Wayne has Old SR 21. Old SR 46 was the original number given the a segment from Auburn to Angola. The section between the Old SR 21 and Old SR 46 was known as Custer Trail. In 1924, the section north of Fort Wayne became Old SR 13 and went from Fort Wayne to the Michigan state line. US 27 in Indiana is one of the original US Highways of 1926, then connecting Cheboygan, Michigan with Cincinnati through Fort Wayne. In November 1967, Indiana completed its northern segment of Interstate 69, the last incomplete section being opened between Angola and the Michigan/Indiana state line, supplanting US 27 as a through route. Interstate 69 north of Fort Wayne had been completed in stages, the designation of US 27 was moved to the interstate. Some segments of old US 27 remained as state highways with designations as SR 327, SR 427, and SR 127. Parts of these routes, comprising what had been the old surface road of US 27, were eventually returned to country governments. Within greater Fort Wayne, US 27 was diverted from Coldwater Road to Lima road. Then in 2001, INDOT removed the US 27 designation north of its interchange with I-69. On March 9, 2007, legislation was introduced in the Indiana House of Representatives to designate US 27 as historic highway. Richmond, one of the cities through which US 27 passes, would have two historic highways passing through it as the original National Road (U.S. Route 40) runs through Richmond as well.

After that its market share declined as demand rose. Spain has five active nuclear power plants with seven reactors producing 21% of the country's electricity as of 2013. A nuclear power moratorium was enacted by the Socialist government in 1983. For a time the country had a policy of phasing out nuclear power in favor of renewables. It ended in 1997 but no public or private company has been interested in building new nuclear plants.

History In early 1947, the Commission was created within the National Research Council in order to rule on issues of \\"Technical Physics of greatest interest to the country\\". In the middle of that year, the Naval Attache of the United States Embassy in Spain, won the Laboratory and Workshop on Research Staff of the Navy an extensive collection of American journals specializing in nuclear fission and its civil and military applications. This was the first contact with the outside world, and led to international. To that end, establishing the Atomic Research Board in the form of study (Irani 1987). His work during the triennium (1948‚Äì1950) focuses on two aspects. On the one hand, begin to train abroad the first Spanish experts on nuclear issues. On the other hand, begins the search for uranium to serve as raw material for the development of the first investigations. Studies conducted by the Board, lead by Decree-Law on 22 October 1951 to the Nuclear Energy Board, which aims to provide new knowledge in the process of energy production. In 1963, two significant events occur: the enactment of the Nuclear Energy Act and prior authorization from the Central will be the first Spanish (Almonacid de Zorita, Guadalajara) later known as Jose Cabrera. In June 1965 construction began three years after the plant was synchronized and provided power to the grid for the first time. Three years later it opened in 1971, launched the Santa Maria de Garo√±a (Burgos), with a capacity of 460MW. In 1972, the network was connected to the Spanish-French central Vandell√≥s (Tarragona) with a capacity of 500MW. Soon on a plan was drafted to open four nuclear stations in the Basque region, i.e. Deba, Lem√≥niz, Ispazter and Tudela. The plan faced strong opposition and protests across the area, with all four drafted nuclear stations finally concentrating in just one located at Lemoniz. However, following a violent campaign by ETA to stop it, it finally did not come into operation either. The Spanish government officially declared a moratorium in 1984. The fire occurred in 1989 in Vandell√≥s destroyed part of its facilities. After evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of repair made a year after the fire, led to the decision to withdraw this plant. Zorita, Vandell√≤s and Garo√±a, the three so-called first-generation plants, represent a combined capacity of 1,220 MW. Following the good results obtained in them, and the growing need for energy, it was decided to build seven new groups (four plants) of much greater production capacity, resulting in an additional nuclear power of 6,500 MW. At the beginning of 1981, the first group of Almaraz (C√°ceres) began producing power with a capacity of 930 MW. In 1983, the reactor Asc√≥ (Tarragona) came into operation with a capacity of 930 MW, as well as a second group with the same power in Almaraz. In 1984 he inaugurated the central Cofrents (Valencia) with a capacity of 975 MW, a year after the network is connected to the second reactor of 930 MW Asc√≥ group. In December 1987, enters the central testing period Vandell√≥s II, and finally, in 1989 is put into operation the central Trillo I (Guadalajara) to 1066 MW. As shown, nuclear power plants in Spain are located in the northern half. This is because the area is less seismic impact of the peninsula and where the presence of large rivers Tajo and Ebro meet their needs for water used for cooling. =Current situation= Spain has a total of 10 nuclear installations within their mainland, among which are six stations, which are a total of eight nuclear units: Almaraz I and II, Asc√≥ I and II, Cofrents, Trillo, Vandell√≥s I and II. The Jos√© Cabrera, better known as Zorita, ceased operations on 30 April 2006. So did Santa Maria de Garo√±a in 2012. On the other hand, Vandell√≥s I is being dismantled. Spain also possesses a nuclear fuel factory in Salamanca (Juzbado) and a storage facility for radioactive waste, low and intermediate level in C√≥rdoba (El Cabril). Nuclear power plants In 1964, Spain began construction on its first of three nuclear reactors and completed construction in 1968. This became the first commercial nuclear reactor. In the 1970s, Spain began construction on seven second generation reactors, but only completed five. A moratorium was enacted by the socialist government in 1983. Spain stopped the building of new nuclear power plants in 1984. The first generation of nuclear plants in Spain were all turnkey projects, including the Jos√© Cabrera Nuclear Power Plant and the Vandell√≤s Nuclear Power Plant. The second generation of plants were domestically built by companies including Empresarios Agrupados, INITEC and ENSA (Equipos Nucleares SA). Five of these were built. The third generation of Spanish plants (not to be confused with Generation III) includes the Trillo-1 and Vandellos-2. All of the other five units of this series were halted in the middle of construction after a moratorium stopping further construction passed in 1994. Capacity of the nuclear fleet has still increased since then due to power uprates. There are no plans for either expansion or accelerated closure of nuclear plants. A leak of radioactive material from the Asc√≥ I nuclear power plant in November 2007 sparked protests. The country's government has pledged to shut down its eight nuclear reactors once wind and solar energy become viable alternatives such as in neighbouring country Portugal. Fuel cycle ENUSA is a company in Spain with various holdings in uranium mining. A Uranium mine in Saelices el Chico was operated for some time, but is now decommissioned and Spain imports all of its Uranium fuel. State owned Empresa Nacional de Residuos Radiactivos SA was established in 1984 and is the responsible outfit for radioactive waste disposal and decommissioning. There is a temporary dry storage facility at the Trillo Nuclear Power Plant, and research for a long term geological repository won't commence until 2010.  Nuclear waste  Spain stores nuclear waste at the reactor sites for ten years with no reprocessing. Plans for future storage include a temporary storage facility in Trillo, until the establishment of a longer-term storage facility. Funding for nuclear waste management is paid by a tax of 1% on all revenues from nuclear power. As of 2017 Spain has extended the life of the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant and a nuclear storage facility will be built according to the Spanish secretary of State for the EU Jorge Toledo Albi√±ana, stating work will start regardless of Portugals complaints, and uranium bars that will remain radioactive for the next 300 years will be stored on site.

The division was formed on mobilization of the German Army in August 1914 as part of XVIII Reserve Corps and was disbanded in October 1918, with its assets being distributed to other units.25. Reserve- Division (Chronik 1914-1918) The division was raised in the Grand Duchy of Hesse and the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau, while its 83rd Reserve Infantry Regiment included troops from the Principality of Waldeck. Combat chronicle The 25th Reserve Division began World War I on the Western Front, fighting through Belgium and France in what became known as the Allied Great Retreat, culminating in the First Battle of the Marne. It then participated in the Race to the Sea, fighting in Flanders and the Artois, including at Lille. In December 1914, it was sent to the Eastern Front. In 1915, it participated in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive, including the battles at Lemberg (now Lviv) and Brest-Litovsk. It then fought in the Serbian campaign. After this campaign, the division was transferred from Macedonia back to the Western Front. After several months' fighting in the Argonne Forest, the division entered the Battle of Verdun in July 1916, where it suffered heavy losses. It also faced the French offensive in August 1917 at Verdun, where it again suffered heavy losses. In 1918, the division faced Allied offensives at the Battle of Cantigny, Montdidier and Noyon, and in the Somme Offensive, again taking heavy losses. The division was dissolved on 20 October 1918. Until 1918, Allied intelligence rated the division as second class, but downgraded it based on its use by the German high command and performance in battle.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 355-358.

Cyrus \\"Lupes\\" Lupo is a fictional character on the long-running NBC series Law & Order, played by Jeremy Sisto. He replaced Nina Cassady, who was written out of the show due to Milena Govich's departure from the cast. He appeared in 63 episodes. Character development Prior to his transfer to the 27th Detective Squad, Lupo spent four years as a member of the NYPD Intelligence Division investigating terrorist groups overseas in Iraq, Pakistan, and Morocco; while on this assignment, Lupo often worked alone, without backup and unarmed. Lieutenant Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson) notes Lupo was cited for closing important cases in \\"very unfriendly parts of the world, without warrants, without a weapon, and without back-up.\\" He was a patrolman in the 27th precinct during the 1990s. His shield number is 2632. He is from Rego Park, Queens. Upon his assignment, Lupo partners with Ed Green (Jesse L. Martin) in order to solve the assisted suicide death of his brother Thomas. In a later investigation, he takes advantage of an opportunity to learn the names of the practicing psychiatrist's patients by e-mailing himself the patient list on his BlackBerry. The evidence obtained is later ruled inadmissible. Lieutenant Anita Van Buren rebukes Lupo and Green for a \\"bad search\\". When Green leaves the precinct, Lupo becomes the second detective to be promoted from Junior to Senior Partner. Both Green and his new junior partner Kevin Bernard (Anthony Anderson) call him \\"Lupes\\". While Lupo was still a patrolman in the 27th Precinct, he witnessed a Christmas morning crime scene in which a man murdered his wife and two children. This bloody crime scene left him with PTSD and he began drinking to deal with the trauma. While he was abusing alcohol, he appeared in court to testify against the man who committed the crime, and the defense lawyer discovered he was under the influence while testifying on the stand. He continued drinking until he fell asleep in a patrol car while hung over on the job. Lupo's partner went to get him a cup of coffee, and was killed during the armed robbery of the bodega. After that, Lupo quit drinking and saw a therapist for nine months. Lupo's duty weapon is a Glock 19. In season 19, he and Bernard become the first characters in the series to kill a suspect in the line of duty when they shoot a murder suspect who pulls a gun on them. Only two prior characters had shot suspects before: Detective Joe Fontana (Dennis Farina), who had shot an armed suspected cop killer, and Van Buren, who had killed an armed mugger when she was off duty. In season 20, he gets romantically involved with a witness (Camille Chen), who later turns out to be a con artist and a murderer; Lupo nearly ruins the case as a result. Personality Though his religious affiliation, if any, is unknown, Lupo appears to have some knowledge of the Bible, as he correctly identifies a quotation as being derived from the book of Romans. He attended Catholic school as a child, and refers to the teaching nuns as \\"gangsters\\". Prior to her marrying his brother, Lupo had been involved with his sister-in-law Jenny. It has also been revealed that he speaks both Spanish and Chinese and is taking first year law courses at night at Brooklyn College, part of the City University of New York, which does not have a law school. The CUNY law school is located in Flushing, Queens. (There is a Brooklyn Law School located at 250 Joralemon Street in Brooklyn, but it is not affiliated with the CUNY System.) There is an inside joke throughout the series in which Lupo thinks about \\"getting a dog\\". He later takes one home, named \\"Otto\\". He can read Japanese. He is a big fan of graphic novels.

Partially owing to the significance of the Bible in society, Biblical languages are studied more widely than many other dead languages. Furthermore, some debates exist as to which language is the original language of a particular passage, and about whether a term has been properly translated from an ancient language into modern editions of the Bible. Scholars generally recognize three languages as original biblical languages: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. Language of the Hebrew Bible The Hebrew Bible, also known as the Tanakh (Hebrew: ), consists of 39 books. \\"Hebrew\\" in \\"Hebrew Bible\\" may refer to either the Hebrew language or to the Hebrew people who historically used Hebrew as a spoken language, and have continuously used the language in prayer and study, or both. The texts were mainly written in Biblical Hebrew, with some portions (notably in Daniel and Ezra) in Biblical Aramaic. Biblical Hebrew, sometimes called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of the Hebrew language. The very first translation of the Hebrew Bible was into Greek. This is known as the Septuagint (LXX), which later became the received text of the Old Testament in the Catholic church and the basis of its canon. This began sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century BC, with the first portion of the Hebrew Bible, the Torah, being translated into Koine Greek. Over the next century, other books were translated (or composed) as well. This translation became known as the Septuagint and was widely used by Greek-speaking Jews, and later by Christians. It differs somewhat from the later standardized Hebrew (Masoretic Text). This translation was promoted by way of a legend that seventy separate translators all produced identical texts. The Latin Vulgate by Jerome was based upon the Hebrew for those books of the Bible preserved in the Jewish canon (as reflected in the Masoretic Text), and on the Greek text for the rest. Other ancient Jewish translations, such as the Aramaic Targums, conform closely to the Masoretic Text, and all medieval and modern Jewish translations are based upon the same. Christian translations also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the Septuagint (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the Masoretic Text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions. Languages of the New Testament The books of the Christian New Testament are widely agreed to have originally been written in Greek, specifically Koine Greek, even though some authors often included translations from Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Certainly the Pauline Epistles were written in Greek for Greek-speaking audiences. See Greek primacy for further details. Koine Greek was the popular form of Greek which emerged in post-classical antiquity (c.300 BC ‚Äì AD 300), and marks the third period in the history of the Greek language.Andriotis, Nikolaos P. History of the Greek language It is also called Alexandrian, Hellenistic, Common, or New Testament Greek. Some scholars believe that some books of the Greek New Testament (in particular, the Gospel of Matthew) are actually translations of a Hebrew or Aramaic original. A famous example of this is the opening to the Gospel of John, which some scholars argue to be a Greek translation of an Aramaic hymn. Of these, a small number accept the Syriac Peshitta as representative of the original. See Aramaic primacy. Likewise, some traditional Roman Catholic scholars believed the Gospel of Mark was originally written in Latin. However, the received text of the New Testament is Greek and nearly all translations are based upon the Greek text.

The character returned to television in the thirteenth season premiere of Special Victims Unit, broadcast on September 21, 2011. He has appeared in sixty-three episodes of L&O; and four episodes of SVU.  Character overview  = Appearances = Law & Order Within the continuity of Law & Order, Cutter is an Executive Assistant District Attorney, following the appointment of his predecessor Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) to the New York County District Attorney seat vacated by Arthur Branch (Fred Dalton Thompson). He works closely with Connie Rubirosa (Alana de la Garza), the Assistant District Attorney who had previously aided McCoy. Because of this, he has occasionally discussed McCoy with her--usually with complaints--in an attempt to understand his new boss. As evidenced by his first appearance, he is familiar with former District Attorney Arthur Branch, having apparently been in Branch's office on at least one occasion. In the episode \\"Executioner\\", he reveals that he supports the death penalty. In the L&O; episode \\"By Perjury\\", he is almost murdered in the bathroom of the courthouse before being saved at the last moment by detectives Cyrus Lupo (Jeremy Sisto) and Kevin Bernard (Anthony Anderson).

Although he did the required undergraduate work, a few college credits were not recorded into his academic record. As a result of the missing credits, Cutter never received an undergraduate degree, a Bachelor of Arts (BA). Despite the lack of an undergraduate degree, he attended and graduated from law school; however, he \\"perpetuated\\" the oversight to the Bar Overseers by misrepresenting to them that he had received a BA and was admitted to the New York State Bar. He made the same misrepresentation when he applied for a position with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. At the end of the episode, he receives a letter of reprimand from the Bar Overseers which also states that the flaw in his academic background does not prejudice his past convictions. The letter is published in the Law Journal the next day, and he is able to retain his law license. Law & Order: Special Victims Unit In 2011, the character was introduced into the continuity of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. In the show's universe, Cutter is promoted at the District Attorney's office to Bureau Chief ADA, where he oversees the assistant district attorneys assigned to the Special Victims Unit, most notably longtime Special Victims ADA's Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) and Casey Novak (Diane Neal). He is introduced as SVU's Bureau Chief in the episode \\"Scorched Earth\\", where an Italian diplomat is accused of raping a hotel maid. He works with Cabot to prosecute the case. When he tells her that they are dropping the charges, she protests his decision, saying \\"All I ever heard was how Mike Cutter was a crusader for justice.\\" The case goes to trial, but the jury deadlocks on the rape charge. In the episode \\"True Believers\\", Cutter takes the lead on a case when Cabot is unavailable where a college music student (Sofia Vassilieva) is raped at gunpoint by a drug dealer. Powerful defense attorney Bayard Ellis (Andre Braugher) uses issues of race in his defense and Cutter fails to get a guilty verdict on the case. Cutter's stronghanded tactics do not sit well with the SVU detectives, especially Detective Nick Amaro (Danny Pino), who has to be calmed by Sergeant John Munch (Richard Belzer) when Cutter asks him a question about the legality of their arrest. Cutter is last seen in the episode \\"Father's Shadow\\", in which he prosecutes a reality show producer for raping an aspiring actress. = Personality =  Legal tactics  Roache describes his character as follows: \\"Sometimes he's a little dangerous; he's not necessarily a comfortable kind of guy.\\" (...) \\"He cares about justice ... but he sometimes takes these leaps out-of-the-box and is kind of non-linear.\\" Like his predecessor, Jack McCoy, Cutter is dogged in his pursuit of justice, to the point that he is willing to bend or break rules to secure a conviction. In L&O;'s \\"Darkness\\", detectives Cyrus Lupo (Jeremy Sisto) and Ed Green (Jesse L. Martin) find the likely hideout of a kidnapping victim after Lupo questions the father of a deceased suspect knowing that the father suffers from alzheimer's and can't positively identify the store address. When the presiding judge is approached for a search warrant, he refuses to execute the warrant without further evidence such as computerized police records which, because the city is experiencing a power blackout, are inaccessible. Gambling that he could be able to justify the actions later, Cutter tells the detectives to enter the premises anyway. In L&O;'s \\"Quit Claim,\\" he nearly suborns perjury. In L&O;'s \\"Tango\\", he realizes one of the jurors is attracted to his ADA, Connie Rubirosa (Alana de la Garza). He makes no mention of this to her, and encourages her to cross-examine witnesses in his stead. When she learns the truth, she feels Cutter \\"pimped [her] out to the jury\\". Regardless, subsequent episodes have portrayed a stable, friendly working relationship. In L&O;'s \\"Brilliant Disguise\\", Cutter talks about his actions while cross- examining the defendant in an attempt to elicit incriminating testimony, but claimed that he'd ordered her to instead of tricked her, much to her displeasure. By the end of the episode, he apologizes to her, and she accepts his apology. Cutter has been known to manipulate potential witnesses to get them to testify. Near the end of \\"Darkness\\", Cutter uses a man's daughter to make him testify. In another episode, he convinces a young girl that her relative may face serious charges unless she talks. He even once intimidated a defendant in L&O;'s \\"Bogeyman\\"; by implying that he is a member of a Scientology-like group called \\"Systemotics,\\" Cutter exploits the defendant's paranoia to earn a plea bargain. In the episode \\"Skate or Die\\", Cutter pretends to be a Russian spy to provoke a mentally ill witness into headbutting him in front of Dr. Elizabeth Olivet (Carolyn McCormick) and demonstrate to her that the witness is a threat to himself and to others, leaving her no choice but to order him to take anti-psychotic medication. Cutter benefits from his provocation because the medicated witness is now able to provide coherent testimony. In the L&O; season 19 finale \\"The Drowned and the Saved\\", McCoy agrees not to bring criminal charges against Governor Donald Shalvoy (Tom Everett Scott) in exchange for testifying against his wife as part of a plea deal in a case involving prostitution and murder. After McCoy leaves the room, however, Cutter shows a piece of paper to Shalvoy purporting to contain a list of call girls the governor visited, and demands that he resign at the threat of exposing the list. Later, after Shalvoy publicly resigns, Cutter reveals that the piece of paper is blank. In the L&O; season 20 episode \\"Immortal\\", when Cutter questions Lt. Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson), he uses her ongoing cancer treatment to win his case. Van Buren later confronts him outside of court, accusing him of using her and violating her privacy. At the end of the episode, the two are implied to be on non- speaking terms. = Personal life = Cutter is pro-life. It is implied in several episodes that Cutter has romantic feelings for Rubirosa. McCoy, despite experiencing controversy due to his own relationships with various former ADAs, appears to understand how Cutter feels. In the episode \\"For the Defense\\", it is hinted that Rubirosa is aware of his attraction, but her own feelings are left ambiguous. Cutter's parents divorced when he was 10 years old, and since then, he has had very little contact with his father.

The people of Earth have created a Hypergate, which links the two galaxies together.

Both the player character and his space ship are able to use MetalMorphosis (a transformation ability) to navigate certain areas. The player must retrieve missing pieces of the ship, while simultaneously fending off aliens who desire the secret of MetalMorphosis. Reception GamePro gave the game a positive review, commenting that the game's two play styles complement each other, the controls are responsive and accurate, the graphics are attractive, and the music and sound effects suit the game's tone.

Created by , it was syndicated by AP Newsfeatures. The Phantom Magician, an early supporting character in the strip, is regarded by some comics historians as among the first superheroes of comics.  Publication history  departed in May 1940 to take over Secret Agent X-9; the last daily strip credited to Graff ran June 15, 1940. Charles Rabb took over the strip on June 17, 1940, and added a Sunday page in October 1941, also known as Patsy in Hollywood. Rabb left the strip as of December 5, 1942. After Rabb, the strip was unsigned for a few months (December 7, 1942 - March 20, 1943), and then went through a succession of creators: George Storm (March 22, 1943 - April 8, 1944), Al McClean (April 10, 1944 - April 7, 1945), Richard Hall (April 9, 1945 - April 6, 1946) and finally William Dyer, who debuted on the strip April 8, 1946, and stayed for nine years, until the strip came to a conclusion on April 2, 1955. Characters and story The strip originated as a fantasy. The story began with five-year-old Patsy carried away in a kite to the magical kingdom of Ods Bodkins. (This setting is unrelated to Odd Bodkins, a later comic strip launched in 1964 by cartoonist Dan O'Neill.) During her fanciful journey, Patsy was accompanied and often rescued by the masked Phantom Magician. When they returned to Earth, the Phantom Magician doffed his duds for conventional clothing and assumed the identity of Phil Cardigan, Patsy's uncle, in December 1936. With stories situated in Hollywood, Uncle Phil worked as a screenwriter and Patsy was a young movie actress for producer J. P. Panberg. After Phil was eventually written out of the strip, Patsy's new sidekick was Hollywood agent Skidd Higgins. =The Phantom Magician= An early supporting character, the swashbuckling Phantom Magician, introduced a fantasy element. Some comics historians regard this character and Lee Falk's Mandrake the Magician as among the first superheroes of comics. Don Markstein writes, \\"Depending on how you define the term, Patsy's recurring rescuer, The Phantom Magician, may have been the first superhero in comics... Some people say Mandrake the Magician, who started in 1934, was comics' first superhero.\\"The Adventures of Patsy at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on March 15, 2012.

The highway runs for about through Huntington and Whitley counties. The highway passes through mostly agricultural areas and short east‚Äìwest section with U.S. Route 24 (US 24) near Andrews. SR 105 was first designated in early 1932 and the entire original route was paved in the early 1960s. A small reroute of SR 105 north of Andrews happen in the late 1960s. Route description SR 105 begins at an intersection with SR 9 east of La Fontaine and runs north. The road has an intersection with SR 218 about north of SR 9. North of SR 218, SR 105 passes through the community of Banquo in rural southwestern Huntington County. The road has an intersection with SR 124 west of Mount Etna. The road then passes through Lost Bridge State Recreation Area and crosses over the Salamonie Lake. North of the lake SR 105 makes a sharp curve becoming east‚Äìwest, before a second sharp curve that makes the road north‚Äìsouth once again. The road heads north towards Andrews, passing through rural farm land on the way. On the way to Andrews SR 105 takes two more sharp curves. Shortly after the curves the highway enters the town of Andrews concurrent with Main Street and passing through residential areas. Main Street crosses a Norfolk Southern rail track in the center of town. SR 105 leaves Andrews as it crosses over the Wabash River and has an intersection with US 24. SR 105 heads southwest concurrent with US 24 as a four-lane divided highway, running roughly parallel to the Wabash River. After just over a mile SR 105 turns off of US 24 heading north towards South Whitley. On the way to South Whitley the road crosses SR 16 and passes through the community of Bippus. After Bippus the route crosses SR 114 and the Huntington‚ÄìWhitley county line. In Whitley County SR 105 passes through rural farmland before entering South Whitley. On the south side of South Whitley the road curves and becomes east‚Äìwest. The SR 105 designation ends at an intersection with SR 5 crossing northwest‚Äìsoutheast and SR 14 continuing towards the east and north concurrent with SR 5. INDOT's surveys in 2016 showed that the highest traffic levels along SR 105 were the 8,366 vehicles daily along the concurrent with US 24; the lowest counts were the 299 vehicles per day just north of US 24.  History  SR 105 was first a proposed addition in early 1932 between SR 9 and South Whitley much as it does today. The state highway commission accepted SR 105, between SR 9 and the Huntington‚ÄìWhitley county line into the state road system on March 28, 1932. The rest of SR 105 was added by September of that year. At its time of commissioning SR 105 had an intermediate driving surface. The entire route was paved between 1962 and 1963. Between 1966 and 1967 a short segment of road was built just north of US 24 and SR 105 was rerouted along US 24 and this new segment of roadway.

Principally starring George Burns and Connie Stevens, the series was Burns' first major work following the death of his wife and professional partner, Gracie Allen, who had died of a heart attack about a month prior to its debut. Synopsis George Burns, 1961 In the series (a slight variation of The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show), Burns plays a somewhat fictionalized version of himself. He is the owner of an apartment building, while Stevens plays his tenant, Wendy Conway. Episodes typically revolved around Wendy pulling Burns into comedic situations mostly involving her husband, played by Ron Harper, and other people in the building. As a regular part of its format, Burns would often break the fourth wall to comment directly to the audience about the episode's events.Doug Quick's history of programming on television station WAND Burns as landlord would watch his attractive young tenant on what appears to the modern eye to be a surreptitious closed circuit television transmission with hidden cameras (he also accomplished this with his \\"TV in the den\\" in later episodes of The Burns and Allen Show). The television was not so much a \\"surreptitious closed circuit television\\" but rather a plain old television set where George Burns watched the show \\"Wendy and Me\\" along with the television audiences (This was also the case when he watched events unfold on The Burns and Allen Show.) James T. Callahan appeared in the series as Danny Adams, a playboy friend of Wendy's strait-laced husband. J. Pat O'Malley played the apartment handyman. As part of Stevens's contract with Warner Bros., Burns agreed to produce another series for her studio, No Time For Sergeants, which appeared before Wendy and Me on ABC's Monday night schedule.

Early life Leigh was born in 1934, in Bridgeport, Connecticut to West Indian parents who died in an automobile accident when he was in his teens. His older sister and her husband assumed his care. After college, and Reserve Officers' Training Corps, Leigh, who was fluent in five languages, attended Army Language School at Yale, served as a lieutenant, mostly at Fort Leonard Wood, and rose to Captain. He then worked as a technical writer in Connecticut. Leigh became the assistant to Bayard Rustin, when Rustin was organizing the 1963 March On Washington. After the March, Leigh joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Atlanta. In SNCC he worked at times with Communications Director, Julian Bond, and manned the WATS-line. WATS was SNCC's main means of communicating with the activists in the hamlets of the South. WATS saved money and had the advantage of avoiding putting calls through the local telephone operators, who could listen to the calls and were often very friendly with the constabulary and the Ku Klux Klan. Leigh could type 120 words a minute and his efficiency and competence made him invaluable to the organization. The Hattiesburg Project In January 1964, Leigh went to Hattiesburg, Mississippi to work on Freedom Day, a massive Voting Rights action in the town. Shortly thereafter, when a SNCC Field Secretary had to leave the Hattiesburg project, it was felt that Leigh's maturity, diplomacy and firmness made him the best candidate for the job. He became almost a son to Mrs Lenon E. Woods, who sponsored the project by housing the office downstairs from her Woods Guest House, in which she lived. Hers was the only \\"Negro\\" hotel ‚Äî the only lodging for African- American travelers ‚Äî in all Southern Mississippi. Mrs Woods owned most of the land under the Negro business district of Hattiesburg. She was also a silent partner as a landowner in parts of the White downtown area, which she, as a person of color, could not own publicly. On the eve of Freedom Day, Mrs Woods chased off a crowd of lawmen, firemen and city officials who had come to arrest Leigh just before the massive Voter Registration drive.Oral history with Sheila Michaels, Civil Rights in Mississippi digital archive, University of Southern Mississippi, June 5, 1999 (see http://www.usm.edu/crdp/index.html) Under Leigh, the Hattiesburg Project grew to be the largest and most diverse in Mississippi Freedom Summer. It had seven Freedom Schools, two community centers and three libraries (persons of color could not use the town library and had no borrowing privileges).Oral History with Sandra Adickes, Civil Rights in Mississippi digital archive, University of Southern Mississippi, October 21, 1999 The Freedom Summer project provided legal services donated by lawyers from three organizations, medical services provided by specialists who rotated through, usually during their summer vacations, and teams of ministers who came to work on voter registration under the direction of Rev. Bob Beech of the National Council of Churches Ministry, which also sponsored a local Ministers' Union.Bruce Hilton, Delta Ministry, (McMillan Publishing, New York, New York), 1969 Leigh also helped manage the U.S. Senate campaign of Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party candidate Victoria Gray Adams who sought to oppose the segregationist, John Stennis. Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party registered Negro voters, who were barred from voting in Mississippi, and ran candidates opposing the Democratic Party nominees. The campaign was to challenge the Mississippi Democratic Party at the 1964 convention in Atlantic City. The segregationist Democratic Party ran the state, and MFDP sought to unseat them and show the national party that people of color would be a voting bloc equal to the segregationists, if allowed to register to vote. When the Department of Economic Opportunity launched Head Start in 1965, newspapers, segregationist congressmen, and local governments denounced it as a Communist conspiracy. Leigh managed the program in Southeastern Mississippi. Head Start was a natural successor to the Freedom Schools. Funding was controlled through local governments, which tried to sabotage the program. They refused the grants and funding. In Congress and locally, governments struggled to wrest control from the local people who had staffed the new program.Curry, Constance W.

He then became an assistant to Walter Washington, the first Black Mayor of Washington, DC. Leigh relocated to New York, was employed as an Administrative Assistant by Bechtel, and as an organist at the Abyssinian Baptist Church. In 1972 police found Leigh in a subway in Harlem, brutally beaten. He suffered amnesia, and his friends searched in vain for six months, until he told Harlem Hospital social workers the name someone called him in a dream. When he began to regain his memory he was found beaten near his room in the YMCA in 1974. He suffered brain damage, never recovered his memory, and was placed in adult home care.Tusa, Bobs M, and Randall, Herbert.

The play was written and first published in 1979. M√ºller and his wife Ginka Cholakova co-directed its first theatrical production in 1980, at the intimate 'Theatre im 3.Stock' studio space of the Volksb√ºhne in Berlin (opening on 16 November). M√ºller also directed a full-house production in 1982 at the Bochum Theatre in West Germany.Weber (1984, 82). Dramatic structure Composed with a \\"collage- like\\" dramaturgical structure, the play stages intertextual relationships with a range of classics from the modern theatre, each dealing with the models and ethics of revolutionary action: Brecht's The Decision (1930), B√ºchner's Danton's Death (1835), and Genet's The Blacks (1958), among others. The play also uses motifs from Anna Seghers' story \\"The Light on the Gallows\\" (which M√ºller had treated in a poem of 1958)Weber (1984) and M√ºller (1979b). and, M√ºller adds, \\"biographical events are involved, a trip to Mexico among others that was very important for me in connection with the play.\\"Quoted by Weber (1984, 83). In addition to its dramatic and often self-consciously theatrical scenes, the play is punctured by several lyrical and narrative elements.Paul Klee's Angelus novus (1920), used by the philosopher Walter Benjamin as an image for his 'angel of history' (\\"the course of human history as a path of accumulating destruction which 'the angel' views with horror but from which he cannot turn away\\"), which M√ºller transforms into 'the Angel of Despair' in The Mission: \\"With my hands I dispense ecstacy, numbness, oblivion, the lust and the torment of bodies.\\" The example of M√ºller's re-working may have formed an influence on the American playwright Tony Kushner, who developed the image of the 'angel of history' in the two parts of his Angels in America (stage plays 1991‚Äì1992; TV series 2003), since Kushner was taught drama by M√ºller's American translator at New York University, the Brechtian dramaturgy and directing professor Carl Weber. Kushner wrote the Foreword for the most-recent English-language collection of M√ºller's work (M√ºller 2001). A lengthy narrative section bisects the play, arriving unmotivated within the immediate terms of a traditional dramatic logic. It is written in the first person as a 'stream of consciousness' but it lacks a discernible character-assigning speech-heading (this strategy, which leaves the text 'open' or 'writable' in Barthes' terms, is characteristic of M√ºller's dramaturgy). Adopting a 'Kafkaesque', subjective perspective (the outlook, as Brecht put it, \\"of a man caught under the wheels\\"),Quoted by Benjamin (1973, 111). the protagonist of this section narrates a nightmarish dream sequence in which time and space become unhinged and dislocated as he travels in an elevator to receive, he anticipates with both pride and alarm, an important mission from the 'boss' (\\"whom I refer to in my mind\\" he says with epistrophic emphasis, \\"as No. 1\\"). While recalling Kafka's similar dislocations of time (in \\"Give It Up!\\", for example) and the subjective anxieties and alienated horrors of the expressionist drama, this section also has a more directly referential origin;Kafka's \\"Give It Up!\\" illustrates the relation to M√ºller's text succinctly: \\"It was very early in the morning, the streets clean and deserted, I was on my way to the station. As I compared the tower clock with my watch I realized it was much later than I had thought and that I had to hurry; the shock of this discovery made me feel quite uncertain of the way, I wasn't very well acquainted with the town as yet; fortunately, there was a policeman at hand, I ran to him and breathlessly asked him the way. He smiled and said: 'You asking me the way?' 'Yes,' I said, 'since I can't find it myself.' 'Give it up! Give it up!' said he, and turned with a sudden jerk, like someone who wants to be alone with his laughter.\\" (Kafka 1994, 465‚Äì466). There are many examples in both the English and German languages of expressionist drama, but the stream of consciousness passages in Sophie Treadwell's Machinal (1928) or Elmer Rice's The Adding Machine (1923) provide useful English-language examples. in a prefatory note taken originally from his autobiography, M√ºller explains that: :\\"[a]n experience that became a part of this text is one of my approaches to Honecker in the House of the Central Committee, going up in the paternoster. On every floor a soldier with a machine gun sat opposite the entrance to the paternoster. The House of the Central Committee was a high security jail for the captives of power.\\"M√ºller (1979b, 60). The play's structure, in which these different texts and experiences are articulated, is complex. \\"[T]he form or dramaturgy of my plays,\\" M√ºller explains, \\"results from my relation to the material\\" (a relation which Brecht would call a 'Gestus'). He goes on to suggest that it may be the play's activation of many different historical periods (his own 'post-revolutionary' time, the late twenties of Brecht's Lehrst√ºcke, that of post-revolutionary France) that has produced its collage-like \\"deviation from some dramaturgical norm.\\"Radio interview for Deutschlandfunk, quoted in Weber (1984. 83). M√ºller links his dramaturgical experimentation explicitly with the attempt, given its most programmatic formulation by Strindberg eighty years earlier, to render a dream-logic in dramatic terms: :\\"I have always been interested in the structure of stories within dreams, how it is free of transitions, and associations are overlooked. The contrasts create acceleration. The whole effort of writing is to achieve the quality of my own dreams. Independence from interpretation, too. Faulkner's best texts have this quality.\\"M√ºller (1979b, 60). Strindberg's formulation is given in his prefatory note to his A Dream Play (1901): \\"In this dream play the author has, as in his former dream play, To Damascus, attempted to imitate the inconsequent yet transparently logical shape of a dream. Everything can happen, everything is possible and probable. Time and place do not exist; on an insignificant basis of reality the imagination spins, weaving new patterns; a mixture of memories, experiences, free fancies, incongruities and improvisations. The characters split, double, multiply, evaporate, condense, disperse, assemble. But one consciousness rules over them all, that of the dreamer; for him there are no secrets, no illogicalities, no scruples, no laws. He neither acquits nor condemns, but merely relates; and, just as a dream is more often painful than happy, so an undertone of melancholy and of pity for all mortal beings accompanies this flickering tale. Sleep, the great liberator, often seems a tormentor, but when the agony is harshest comes the awakening and reconciles the sufferer with reality‚Äîwhich, however painful, is yet a mercy, compared with the agony of the dream\\" (Strindberg 1991, 175).

He obtained a traditional Jewish education at the ≈Åom≈ºa Yeshiva in Poland and later at the famous Mir Yeshiva in Lithuania. In 1900, Bublick went to Paris to help a group of Bia≈Çystok families trying to gain entry to Argentina under the Baron de Hirsch Fund. After obtaining the appropriate visas, Bublick joined the group for three years as a Hebrew teacher for their children. In 1904 Bublick left Argentina for the United States where he began working for the New York Orthodox Yiddish newspaper, Yiddishe Tageblatt (The Jewish Daily Page). He was a vociferous opponent of Reform and Conservative Judaism. In 1915, he was appointed editor-in-chief of the Yiddishe Tageblatt. As a young man, Bublick drifted away from traditional Jewish life for the Haskalah (Enlightenment) Movement, but eventually returned to religion and became a staunch advocate for Orthodox Judaism. In his book Min Hametzar, he predicted massive intermarriage and detected danger in the Conservative movement. He wrote \\"It's a battle between Harvard and Volozhin.\\" A street in the Ramot neighborhood of Jerusalem is named for Bublick. Zionist activism In 1920, Bublick visited Palestine for the first time. Bublick was active in the Jewish community and was one of the founders of the American Jewish Congress. He was elected as a vice-chairman of the American Jewish Congress in May 1920. He served on the executive board of the World Zionist Organization (1919-1926) and the Jewish Agency for Israel. He was a well-known publicist for religious Zionism and was one of the founders of the American Mizrachi and served as its president from 1928 to 1932.

The western coincides with the Kant≈ç Mountain Range and the southern edge is defined by the B≈çs≈ç Peninsula, the Miura Hills, Tokyo Bay, and Sagami Bay. The Kashima Sea and Kuj≈´kuri Beach define the eastern end of the plain. Most of the rivers originate in the northern or western mountain ranges and flow east or southeast into the Pacific Ocean, Tokyo Bay, or Sagami Bay. In the central part of the plain is the Tone River; in the northern part the Watarase River, Kinu River, Kokai River, Naka River, and Kuji River; and in the southern part the Arakawa River, Tama River, and Sagami River. Of these rivers, the Tone River encompasses a large area of floodplain, for it has the largest drainage area in Japan of . The drainage areas covered by these rivers account for the alluvial lowland of the Kant≈ç Plain.Encyclopedia of Japan Tokyo, K≈çdansha A collection of plateaus constitute a large part of the plain. Among them are the ≈åmiya, Musashino, Sagamino, and J≈çs≈ç Plateaus. These large plateaus are divided into smaller ones by shallow river valleys. One of the common features of the plateaus is that their surfaces are covered with a thick layer of loam of volcanic origin. Volcanic ashes from surrounding volcanoes, Mounts Asama, Haruna, and Akagi to the north and Mounts Hakone and Fuji to the southwest, are thought to have been deposited on these plateaus.Nihon Daihyakka Jiten, Sh≈çgakkan Among the plateaus, the Musashino Plateau has the largest stretch of land, extending from the western edge of ≈åme to the eastern edge of Yamanote which borders the alluvial plains of the Arakawa and Sumida Rivers. Its elevation gradually declines from west to east, measuring 190 m at ≈åme and 20 m at Yamanote.Nihon Daihyakka Jiten, Sh≈çgakkan Hills in the Kant≈ç Plain stand on Tertiary strata and rise higher than surrounding plateaus, exemplified by the Sayama Hills and Tama Hills, typically, undulating between 100 and 200 m above sea level. Hills located at the western edge of the Kant≈ç Plain, the Hiki Hills, Koma Hills, Kusahana Hills, and Kaji Hills, also reach approximately above sea level.Encyclopedia of Japan Tokyo, K≈çdansha What is noteworthy is the overall tilt of the plateaus and hills. In general, the whole area is slightly bent and forming a basin centered in the Tone River and Tokyo Bay. The ongoing process of tectonic extension continues as the plain's central region gradually sinks.Encyclopedia of Japan Tokyo, K≈çdansha The Kant≈ç Plain witnessed its greatest devastation from an earthquake on 1 September 1923, with a death toll calculated of 142,807.

Argentina had declared its independence from Spain in 1816 and there followed a series of revolutionary wars until 1861 when the nation was united. The United States recognized the government of Buenos Aires, the predecessor to Argentina, on January 27, 1823. Caesar Augustus Rodney was appointed as American Minister Plenipotentiary to Buenos Aires. Between 1854 and 1866, U.S. ambassadors were commissioned to the Argentine Confederation. Since 1867, ambassadors have been commissioned to the Argentine Republic. Diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Argentina were interrupted but not severed in June 1944 when the U.S. government recalled its ambassador in a dispute with the newly appointed dictator Edelmiro Juli√°n Farrell. The U.S. government believed that Farrell was not committed to the defense of the Western Hemisphere against the Axis powers. Normal relations were resumed with the appointment of a new ambassador in April 1945 when Argentina declared war against Germany.

Life and work  Strecker was born in Darmstadt, the son of Friedrich Ludwig Strecker, an archivist working for the hessian Grand Duke, and Henriette Amalie Johannette Koch. Adolph Strecker attended school in Darmstadt until 1838 when he changed to the higher Gewerbeschule. After receiving his abitur in 1840, Strecker began studying science at the University of Giessen, where Justus Liebig was a professor. In August 1842, Strecker received his PhD and began teaching at a realschule in Darmstadt. He refused one offer to work for Liebig, but in 1846 he accepted another and became Liebig's private assistant at the University of Giessen. Strecker finished his habilitation in 1848 and became a lecturer at the university. Strecker investigated a wide variety of problems in both organic and inorganic chemistry during his time at Giessen. Examples include the molecular masses of silver and carbon, the reactions of lactic acid, the decomposition of hippuric acid by nitric acid, and the separation of cobalt and nickel. Strecker wanted to leave Giessen for a position at the University of Berlin, but when he heard of an open position at Norway's University of Christiania, he applied for it and in 1851 became a professor there. While in Norway, Strecker focused on organic chemistry, covering a broad range of topics from organometallic chemistry to natural products. Strecker left Norway on Christian Gottlob Gmelin's death in 1860 to accept the latter's position at the University of T√ºbingen. There he conducted research on guanine, xanthine, caffeine, and theobromine, and on the very toxic thallium oxides, which damaged his health severely. He moved to the University of W√ºrzburg in 1870, but his first semester was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871. Strecker became an officer during the war and returned to the university after it, where he started his last semester. In the summer of 1871 he undertook a recreational holiday in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, but his health began to deteriorate. Strecker died in W√ºrzburg, where he is buried in the Hauptfriedhof. * Regnault-Strecker's kurzes Lehrbuch der Chemie.

The Strecker amino acid synthesis Because of the relative simplicity of the reactants, the Strecker synthesis has been invoked by those studying both the origin of life and meteoritic amino acids. Also named for Strecker are the Strecker degradation, which involves the conversion of amino acids into imines and then into ketones, and the Strecker sulfite alkylation.

During this time she had other works she requested or collected for her own personal reading quarters. She was one of the most powerful women of her time period and as such had access to a variety of different methods of attaining manuscripts. She took full advantage of this privilege by commissioning a scribe by the name of David Aubert whose excellent talents in calligraphy can be seen in The Visions of Tondal. Another person who worked on the miniatures in the book is the illuminator Simon Marmion, who was also patronized at this same time by Margaret's husband. = Provenance = In 1475, Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy commissioned the Getty Tondal manuscript in France. She owned it until 1503. In 1853, Charles-Alexandre de Ganay, the Marquis de Ganay, obtained the manuscript and owned it until 1881. It was then owned onwards by Raoul L√©onor Lignerolles, comte de Lignerolles, until 1894. The next owner of the Getty Tondal was Joseph Rapha√´l Vitta, Baron Vitta; he would hold onto it up until 1930 and pass it on to Jean de Brouwer, Baron de Brouwer, a Belgian. It would soon find itself in the hands of an American Hans P. Kraus, Sr. in 1944, having been sold to him via the Librairie FL Tulkens in Brussels. It was then sold to another American named Philip Hofer in 1951. Hofer passed it off to his son, Dr. Myron Arms Hofer, after his death. It was sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1987 where it remains today. = Modern Times = The Torment of Murderers, from Les Visions du Chevalier Tondal The manuscript can be seen at the J. Paul Getty Museum in person or it can be accessed digitally from the official website for the museum.  Description  = Medium = Tempera colors, gold leaf, gold paint, and ink on parchment tipped into a binding of wood boards covered with brown calfskin. = Contents = The text of the Visions of Tondal was created in the south German city of Regensburg, where there was an Irish monastery. It was written by a monk who called himself Marcus in the prologue of the story. The prologue states that the work was commissioned by ‚ÄúAbbess G.‚Äù and indeed, there was an abbess of the Benedictine convent of Saint Paul in Regensberg at this time named Gisela. The monk tells about events that happened during this time that alluding to the possibility that he was an Irish monk and perhaps a visitor to the convent of Saint Paul. Marcus makes reference to two Irish kings that made donations to the monastery of Saint James in The Visions of Tondal; he also tells the reader in Latin the words ‚Äúde barbarico‚Äù translated to ‚Äúfrom the Irish‚Äù cementing his Irish background. It was the most widely read of any manuscript predating the story of Dante, which explains why it was translated into major and minor European languages. It was \\"the most popular and elaborate text in the medieval genre of visionary infernal literature\\" and had been translated forty-three times into fifteen languages by the 15th century,Kren & S McKendrick, 112. 43 from Easting including Icelandic and Belorussian.Easting, 70 It may have been part of the inspiration for Dante's journey into hell, purgatory and heaven. In the story, Tondal is a wealthy Irish knight who passes out at a feast and goes into a deep dream-journey through Hell, Heaven and Purgatory (never so named ‚Äì the doctrine was still in development), guided by an angel. The experience turns Tondal into a pious man. The story is set in Cork, Ireland in 1148, and claims to be a translation of an original in the Irish language, which however has not survived. = Text and Script = The pages of the manuscript are laid out with a large image on the top of the page accompanied by text that describe the story taking place and the pictures displayed. Script would be written with black ink upon parchment paper. There are large Capitals scattered throughout the pages of the manuscript that break up the large blocks of black text on each page. The script on the page also have intricate boarders around the sides of the pages, these boarders would have parts of it illuminated with gold leaf. = Decoration = The miniatures shown throughout The Visions of Tondal display a large variety of techniques and use of color to depict the ideas presented in the text. The images of Hell capture the artist‚Äôs observations of reality in the form of glowing flames with hot red tips over a dark smoky background. Depictions of strange looking monsters fill the landscapes which are full of elegant usage of colors to show not only flames, but also frozen lakes and coldness. Dramatic lighting enhances the effects of the colors and landscapes which in conjunction with the text tell the story in vivid detail. This display of artistic technique flows into the images after Hell, when Tondal gets to images of Paradise the colors shift from bright reds and muted blues towards light blues, whites and vibrant greens presenting a calmer harmonious feel. The images after Hell are less chaotic and simpler; however they visually exhibit a somber, quiet and elegant feel to Paradise, a strong contrast to the hellish images from before strongly reinforcing the ideas of peacefulness and tranquility.

Discovery Mammamia profuga was described from a single male specimen collected from a cave in Taranto Province, Italy in 1964. It was described as a new genus and species in 2011 by a team of Danish and Bulgarian scientists.

Plot summary The film tells the story of a young but noteworthy Taiwanese sculptor and painter, Huang Ching-cheng.Regarding Ching-cheng Huang, consult for instance: Meizhen Zeng et al., Taiwan mei shu yu shehui mai dong. Kaohsiung (Gaoxiong shili meishuguan / Kaohsiung Modern Art Museum) 2000, 158pp. He has already completed his studies in Tokyo and even had a few successful exhibitions. It is war, he plans to see his parents in Taiwan and then wants to go on to Peking, in order to deepen his knowledge of the metier. But as the artist is returning from Japan with his fianc√©e, a young pianist, both - together with hundreds of others - lose their lives on board the passenger liner Takachiho Maru that is tragically torpedoed by the American submarine in March, 1943, while on its way from Kobe to Keelung (Taiwan). In flashbacks, we do not only see Huang in his Tokyo studio, or attending an exhibition of his works, or on the steamship mentioned, looking forward to an encounter with his father, mother, and elder brother. We also see Huang as a boy and adolescent, growing up on the island of Penghu, situated in the Taiwan Straits. It is here that we encounter him as a dreaming but also rebellious youth, in love with a girl from a poor family that he could never have married. We also learn about his father, a businessman who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps as a pharmacist and therefore did not support him anymore when Ching-cheng decided to become an artist. The narration switches between present and past. An important strand of the narration is focused on the restoration of \\"lost\\" works created by the artist that were discovered recently - a difficult task that is carefully accomplished by a young, physically handicapped (or ill?) art restorer. The film is also focused on the young art restorer‚Äôs search for traces of Huang (his grave, for instance), and on her attempt to reconstruct aspects of his biography. The film is a celebration of regional South Taiwan culture, of the land, its people and their contribution to the common Chinese heritage. Incidentally, Ching-cheng Huang is a relative of the filmmaker Yu-shan Huang. Cast * Freddy Lim as Huang Ching-cheng * Janine Chang as Lee Kuei-hsiang * Yuki Hsu as Shio-shio * Jag Huang as Doctor  Cinematic approach  Though not radically innovative, the film cannot be considered ordinary entertainment devoid of aesthetic qualities. On the contrary, it is fairly close to the art film genre. As the Taiwanese critic Shen-chon Lai points out, \\"The film‚Äôs language that is artfully employed displays great similarities with the stream of consciousness technique of contemporary literature\\" and relies on such artistic devices as 'point of view'.\\" Lai notes both its \\"realism, for Taiwan's cultural history is fully reflected\\", and the fact that the reality that is reconstructed \\"is ‚Ä¶ melted in a poetic atmosphere.\\"Hsien-tsung Lai [= pinyin: Shen-chon Lai], ‚ÄúChaoyue fushi de yishu guanghua‚Äù [The Glory of Transcendent Art], in: The Liberty Times, Nov. 3, 2005 [print edition].

The cathedral was built from 1950 to 1952 by the Greek community of Houston. From 1967 to 1974, the church was the seat of the Bishop of the 8th Diocesan District of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America. The church provides a variety of ministries and services as well as housing a number of organizations. It is named for the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary and celebrates its feast day on March 25th. The church hosts services and also functions as part of the Annunciation Orthodox School. Architecture The cathedral was designed in a Byzantine Revival style and is a single-aisle domed basilica with a transept. The iconostasis which divides the nave and the altar holds many of the icons from the original 1917 church. History The first Orthodox church in Houston was built in 1917 on Walker Street in what is now Downtown Houston.Annunciation Cathedral website The original building was made of wood. Initially in its history, most of its worship services were held in Greek. In 1950, the church had to move due to city construction and because the parish had outgrown its old building. A new church was built on Yoakum Street in the Neartown area. Its capacity was about 475. The church was completed in 1952. A community hall named for longtime parishioner S.P. Martel was built next door to the church and still serves the community. In 1960, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America created archdiocesan districts to better serve the Greek Orthodox faithful throughout the country, and Houston was assigned to the 8th Archdiocesan District, which was served by a bishop in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1967 the seat of the bishop for district 8 was moved to Houston, and Bishop Iakovos of Catania arrived in Houston and consecrated the Annuciation Church as his new cathedral. At that time, the diocese included most of the states in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain region. Some of the larger parishes were in Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Omaha, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, Shreveport and Tulsa. The dean of the cathedral was Fr. Nicholas Triantafilou, who served as priest in Houston from 1965‚Äì1991. In 1967, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Church of the Annunciation, the community hosted a \\"Greek night.\\" The following year saw the institution of an annual Greek Festival to celebrate Greek culture, food and Orthodox life. In 1970, the parish founded the Annunciation Orthodox School with classes for students from kindergarten through 8th grade. In 1972, a new bishop was assigned to Houston: Bishop John of Thermon, who was consecrated a bishop in Houston. In 1974, Bishop John moved the see of the diocese to Denver, Colorado, where it has remained ever since.Greek Orthodox Diocese of Denver website The church in Houston continues to be called a cathedral, however, consistent with the longstanding tradition of many denominations. The current cathedral building, with a capacity of over 900, opened on September 30, 2018. The price tag of the expanded facility was $12,500,000.

A chapter of Sea-Scouts of the Boy Scouts of America is sponsored by the cathedral. Other ministries, which meet on a regular basis, include marriage preparation and a grief-support group. Through its Philoptochos Society and other organizations, the Cathedral contributes to charitable organizations in the Houston area and nationwide. These charities include both religious and non-religious agencies which help the poor, the sick and those who are in distress. In addition, volunteers from the cathedral assist by translating for Greek-speaking international patients in the Texas Medical Center, visiting with patients and preparing food for those who can't do that for themselves. Houston Greek Festival Houston Greek Festival was started in 1967 by the members of Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral as a \\"Greek Night\\", which was held on the church's 50th anniversary. The three-day festival is held annually on the first weekend in October (including Thursday) and features Greek food, live Greek music and Greek folk dances, as well as a gift shop and tours of the cathedral. The cathedral grounds on Yoakum Boulevard in the Neartown area of Houston are used to host this annual festival. Proceeds from the Greek Festival are made to various charitable organizations, such as Children's Assessment Center, S.E.A.R.C.H., the Women's Home, Covenant House, Texas Emergency Aid Coalition (EAC), and the Star of Hope Mission.

Specifically, Pottasch is best known as the creator behind the \\"Pepsi Generation\\" advertising campaign. Early life Alan Pottasch was born on August 13, 1927, on Long Island in New York. He grew up in New York City. Pottasch enlisted and served in the United States Navy during World War II. Pottasch enrolled at Pennsylvania State University following World War II. He graduated from Penn State in 1949 with a Bachelor of Arts in creative writing. Pottasch went to a directors school and went on to work at a television station in Dallas, Texas, and as a producer-director at ABC-TV. Pepsi Alan Pottasch began working for PepsiCo in 1957. The year that Pottasch joined PepsiCo, Coca-Cola outsold Pepsi by a six to one margin in the United States. Under Pottasch, the \\"Pepsi Generation\\" marketing campaign was launched in 1963. Pottasch's \\"Pepsi Generation\\" marketing campaign has been called groundbreaking because it focused on the \\"attributes\\" of the consumers buying Pepsi's products (sometimes called \\"selling a way of life\\"), not just attributes of the product itself, such as price or taste. This was a very uncommon marketing strategy for a company in the early 1960s. The campaign and Pepsi Generation theme was launched and aimed at young Baby Boomers just as they were becoming an important consumer and demographic group. The campaign was a risk for Pepsi. Years later Pottasch said in a podcast posted on Yahoo's \\"Giants of Advertising\\" web site, \\"For us to name and claim a whole generation after our product was a rather courageous thing that we weren't sure would take off.\\" The risk paid off for both Pottasch and Pepsi. Under Pottasch's campaigns, Pepsi eventually went from behind Coca-Cola, to being on par with Coke in several markets. Alan Pottasch changed and slightly tweaked Pepsi's slogan to \\"The Choice of a New Generation\\" in 1984. The new theme was meant as a break from the past and show that Pepsi had something new to offer consumers, with an emphasis on music. Pottasch developed famous 1980s Pepsi commercials starring Lionel Richie, David Bowie, and Madonna. However, he was most well known for developing a series of award-winning Pepsi commercials starring Michael Jackson. In a famous accident, Jackson's hair caught on fire while filming one of Pottasch's commercials. He once told a Yahoo podcast, \\"I guess I'm best known for having burned Michael Jackson's hair.\\" Pottasch eventually produced a large number of Pepsi commercials featuring Michael J. Fox, Ray Charles, Cindy Crawford, Britney Spears and Beyonc√© Knowles. Pottasch officially retired from Pepsi in 1991, but continued to work for the company as a consultant. He eventually returned to PepsiCo full-time. He continued to work for Pepsi up to 2007. Alan Pottasch died in his sleep on Friday, July 27, 2007, while on location in Los Angeles filming Pepsi's newest Mt. Dew commercial. He was 79 years old. Pottasch was survived by his wife, Lisa Pottasch, his daughter, Allison Pottasch, who lived with him in New Fairfield, Connecticut, son Alan Pottasch Jr, and sister Harriet Selig. A private memorial ceremony was held at PepsiCo's headquarters in Purchase, New York, in September 2007. References External links *L.A.

A direct sequel, Scruples Two, was published in 1992. The novel details the life story of protagonist Wilhelmina Hunnewell Winthrop (\\"Billy\\"), as she evolves from the overweight \\"poor relation\\" in an aristocratic Boston Brahmin family to become a thin, stylish woman who is left a vast fortune by the death of her much older first husband and who founds an upscale Beverly Hills boutique called \\"Scruples.\\" Plot Born the only child of a distinguished scientist, who is a member of the venerable Winthrop family but must work for a living, Wilhelmina is nicknamed \\"Honey,\\" a diminutive of her middle name. In her infancy, her mother dies and she is raised by her distant father and a housekeeper. She grows up isolated from her extended family and, with the help of the housekeeper, turns to food for comfort. Around the time she graduates from high school, she is left $10,000 by a maiden aunt, who begs her to spend it foolishly while she is still young. In a last-ditch effort to \\"find herself,\\" Honey goes to live in Paris with a French family. There, she undergoes a transformation of both body and soul, first changing her name to Billy, then losing weight, and then gaining Parisian style under the guidance of Liliane, the elegant Frenchwoman who is her hostess. She is also introduced to Edouard, Liliane's relative. It is her first sexual affair, but when the aristocratic but impecunious Edouard discovers that Billy has no money, he shows his true colors and ends the relationship. Billy returns to America and to a Boston stunned by her new body and beauty. Feeling \\"not in her skin,\\" and unwilling, at 19, to start college, she moves to New York to attend the Katharine Gibbs secretarial school and prepare to earn a living. She meets Jessica, her New York roommate, who teaches her about men and sex and becomes her closest friend, and embarks on a whirlwind adventure of sexual discovery. When she graduates from Katie Gibbs, she is hired by Ikehorn Enterprises, and during a business meeting in Barbados, she sleeps with and subsequently marries the CEO, Ellis Ikehorn, who is far older than she. The next several years are happy ones, as Billy and Ellis live a glamorous life filled with parties, homes all over the world, and regular appearances on the Best-Dressed List. Ellis, however, suffers two debilitating strokes, and Billy moves them from Manhattan to Bel Air, for the better climate. But Billy lives as a recluse in their enormous house and looks aimlessly for some purpose in her life, eventually developing a compulsion to shop in Beverly Hills. Seven years after Ellis' stroke, he dies, leaving Billy an enormous fortune but also an enormous amount of guilt. Billy realizes that she will never find \\"what she is looking for,\\" so she decides to open a luxury boutique called \\"Scruples.\\" She hires Valentine O'Neil to design couture clothing for the customers and Valentine's close friend, Spider Elliot, a former fashion photographer who appoints himself the Style Director and arbiter of elegance. The meeting, various romances, and career vicissitudes of Valentine and Spider, along with the development of their relationship, comprise a major subplot in the novel. The story ultimately develops around Billy's second marriage to Vito Orsini, a film producer, a film that he is making, and then around the Oscars. A second subplot concerns Billy's new friend Dolly Moon, a flamboyant supporting actress in Vito's current film project, Mirrors, Dolly's pregnancy, her relationship with an accountant, and a burglary at Price Waterhouse, where the Oscar ballots are tabulated and the results stored. The story ends at the Oscars, where Billy awaits the announcement that Vito's film has won and Dolly dramatically goes into labor. At the same time, Spider and Valentine realize that their friendship has turned into love. TV adaptations The novel was adapted as a hugely successful television miniseries in 1980, starring Lindsay Wagner as Billy, Barry Bostwick as Spider, Kim Cattrall as Melanie, Marie-France Pisier as Valentine, Connie Stevens as Maggie, and film legend Gene Tierney (in her final role) as Harriet Toppington. Due to the success of the mini-series, a pilot for a potential weekly series (featuring a different cast) was produced the following year, but was unsuccessful. In this version, Shelley Smith played Billy Ikehorn, and Dirk Benedict played Spider. Another pilot for a potential Scruples series was made in 2012 by Warner Bros.

Thin pasta such as vermicelli and macaroni and a small amount of butter or oil is sometimes also put in. A small amount of lime is added before serving. The soup is always served hot and is usually accompanied with a sliced bread with which to dip in the soup. Social connotations & celebration Soup joumou has multiple social connotations for the Haitian people. The soup is dignified by its people as independence and resembles a greater revolution that liberated its population. On January 1, Haitians residing throughout all spheres the world celebrate the first successful slave rebellion that recentralized power into its slave majority, with this soup. A local street-food vendor in Haiti was interviewed about the significance of her job and the purpose of her people, she replied ‚ÄúNou se revolisyon√®, nou pran swen youn lot‚Äù or We are revolutionaries; we take care of each other. This is the essence of the Haitian revolution, to obtain self rule and sustain an autonomous system, where its people would be responsible for one another's survival. Specifically, soup joumou was a food source for the French colonial masters on the plantations of Haiti. The meal was ideal for Haitian slaves who were restricted to rations and scraps of food left by their masters ‚Äúleftovers like, like things like mayi moulen, cornmeal and those types of things. From a Haitian perspective, \\"it‚Äôs almost like the squash was more of a like, French people thing, like, the whites, that‚Äôs what they could eat. So the minute that they were able to gain their independence, they used that. They were like, ‚ÄúWe will have soup joumou as a memory of that.‚Äù Food security today in Haiti Soup joumou is a source of nutrition for many Haitians and children. When the colony demanded its freedom and underwent a revolution so that its people could ‚Äútake care of each other,‚Äù European allies and actors including President Jefferson's administration restricted trade and enacted embargoes on the newly founded colony in fear of echoing slave rebellions in their sovereign states. Today in Haiti, 3.8 million innocent Haitian citizens are ‚Äúfood insecure‚Äù on the backs of a revolution that allowed them to be independent, not persistent as citizens scream ‚Äút‚Äúvant‚Äô‚Äù mwen Pa Ka si p√¥ te ank√¥‚Äù (‚Äúmy stomach is tight, I cannot suffer anymore‚Äù). The means of achieving freedom or soup joumou figuratively, was not sufficient enough to sustain an entire population. Culture retention/Remembrance: Understandably, the excess number of slaves transported to Haiti to accelerate the slave labor production of the world's largest coffee and sugar producers, could not completely replicate the social and political structures present at their previous homes. However, the latter shipped slaves, much of whom were war captives sold as slaves, did acquire artistic and metallurgical skills as well as ideologies. The cultural retention of these slaves was present in their religious ideas, musical improvisation, culinary techniques, cooperation and linguistic accenture's. Slaves brought to the western hemisphere specifically living in Charleston, Memphis, New Orleans, Havana, Port-au Prince, and Kingston have been described as superstitious, religious, and spiritual with direct traces to its African diasporal roots. Slaves were observed to ‚Äúfetishize \\"the dead\\" through traditions of family graveyards... faith healing... [and] root doctoring.‚Äù Much of this was retained in the culinary practices used to create combination of foods, compiled in soup joumou consumed in Haiti using the accessible pumpkin like squash that is the base for the soup and gumbo popularly consumed by southern slaves. Both are combination food, particularly practiced by African traditions. Peculiarly, in some Haitian households, the making of soup joumou includes the addition of an ingredient, okra. Okra or ochro‚Äôs name was taken from Central African Mbundu kingombo ‚Äòochro‚Äô thus reinstitures the African reminiscence in the former slave colony. After all of the slave labor that propelled the colony into being the world's highest sugar and coffee producers by the end of the 18th century... it was still illegal for the slaves who prepared the food to taste the finished product of soup joumou. In turn, it is no coincidence that the nation takes tremendous pride in consuming the soup, that they were once forbidden of/from on the day of its independence. Haitian tradition holds that the soup was enjoyed by the slave masters on the former French colony, while the Haitian slaves were forbidden it. Consequently, Soup Joumou is traditionally consumed on New Year's Day (January 1), as a historical tribute to Haitian independence in 1804.

Written by Adam Tooze, it was first published by Allen Lane in 2006. The Wages of Destruction won the Wolfson History Prize and the 2007 Longman/History Today Book of the Year Prize. It was published to critical praise from such authors as Michael Burleigh, Richard Overy and Niall Ferguson. In the book Tooze writes that having failed to defeat Britain in 1940, the economic logic of the war drove the Nazis to invade the Soviet Union. Hitler was constrained to invade the Soviet Union in 1941 to obtain the natural resources necessary to challenge the economic superpowers of the United States and the British Empire. Operation Barbarossa sealed the fate of the third Reich because it was resource constraints that made victory against the Soviet Union impossible, especially when the Soviet Union received supplies from Britain and the US to supplement the resources remaining under Soviet control. The book makes the case for the economic impact of the British and then Anglo-American strategic bombing campaign (though argues that the wrong targets were often selected), challenges the idea of an economic miracle under Albert Speer and rejects the idea that the German economy could have mobilised significantly more women for the war economy.

The identity of the subject, which may simply represent an idealized athlete, is conventional. No attribute in any of the surviving examples clearly identifies Hermes, who wears neither hat nor helmet; none of the surviving original sandals are represented as winged. A pair of sandals figures in the myth of Theseus, and when the painter-dealer Gavin Hamilton uncovered an example in the swamp ground called the Pantanello at Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli in 1769, he hesitated between calling it a Theseus or a Cincinnatus. Jason's myth also involves a lost sandal.Jason's appearance before king Pelias with one sandal, having lost the other in crossing a river, appeared to satisfy an ominous oracle for the king, who sent Jason on his quest as a means of ridding himself of this dangerous interloper. When Augustus Hare saw that sculpture in the Ball Room of Lansdowne House (the Earl of Shelburne having been created Marquess of Lansdowne in 1784), in Berkeley Square, he noted it as \\"Jason fastening his sandal.\\"Augustus John Cuthbert Hare, Walks in London: \\"Lansdowne House\\" (New York: G. Routledge, 1878) vol. II p 85; the identification as Jason had been put forward by Winckelmann The identification with Hermes is based on an identification of the original bronze model as a sculpture of Hermes in the gymnasium and thermae of Zeuxippos in Constantinople, which was described in detail by Christodoros of Koptos in his ekphrasis of the gymnasium as it still remained in Late Antiquity: > There was Hermes, of the golden wand. He stood and fastened up the thongs of > his winged sandal with his right hand, yearning to rush forth upon his > course. His swift right leg was bent at the knee, and on it he rested his > left hand, and meanwhile he was turning his face up to heaven, as if he were > hearing the commands of his king and father\\"Quoted by A. H. Smith, \\"The > Sculptures in Lansdowne House\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 6 > No. 22 (January 1905) p. 277. Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway prefers to call the subject The Sandal-Binder or Jason;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, \\"The Date of the So-Called Lysippean Jason\\" American Journal of Archaeology 68.2 (April 1964:113-128) she notes, that, from the finding sites, the sculpture appears to have been popular in gardens and gymnasia. Judging from the fully lifesize scale of the copies and their generally high quality, the original bronze must have been respected as one of the received masterpieces in the canon of antiquity (Ridgeway 1964:120). Three moderately complete Roman marble copies have survived. *The Louvre Hermes Fastening his SandalMa 83. 1.61 m.. Louvre Atlas database. (illustration) was the first to be discovered.

It was formerly restored with a plowshare in order to illustrate Cincinnatus receiving the delegation from the Roman Senate, an impossible subject for a heroic sculpture; as Winckelmann pointed out, its heroic nudity would have been incongruous.Noted by Haskell and Penny 1981: It has been divested of its accretion. The sculpture is of Pentelic marble, the antique head of Parian marble. *The Lansdowne Sandal Binder (marble, 1.54m.), found in Gavin Hamilton's excavations in 1769 at the site of Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, was offered to Pope Clement XIV who refused it, and sold in 1772 to the Earl of Shelburne;Haskell and Penny 1981:184;G.

Poulsen, Catalogue of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, 1951:204; Copenhagen I.N.2798, height 1.45m; the collection also has a plaster cast (A7) of the Louvre marble. This is the only surviving model that has retained its head, though the head has been broken. *The Munich Sandal-Fastener in the Glyptothek, Munich, was found in the late 1780s by conte G. Campagnoli Marefoschi, in his own grounds on the site of part of Hadrian's Villa; Thomas Jenkins, the English dealer established at Rome, sold it to duca Luigi Braschi Onesti, who had it further restored by Francesco Antonio Franzoni, before selling it to Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. This version shows the second sandal on the ground; other sculptures have been restored with this detail. (Ridgeway 1964:114 and note 11) It has been restored with an unrelated head and has been thoroughly resurfaced. A plaster cast incorporating the features that are original in each of these versions is conserved in the Glytothek, Munich; a bronze casting of it is in the Stadtmuseum, Stettin (Ridgeway 1964:117) Three surviving torsos have also been identified, including one in unfinished state, which has retained its head and has escaped the eighteenth- century Roman restorers; it is now conserved at the Acropolis Museum, Athens. Other variants include sculptures in similar, but reversed mirror-image poses, probably intended as pendants to the Hermes Fastening his Sandal. The theme was taken up by Jean-Baptiste Pigalle in 1744, and by Fran√ßois Rude, who showed at the Paris salon of 1828 a Mercury Fastening his Sandal in plaster.

Paul Samuelson named Schultz (along with Harry Gunnison Brown, Allyn Abbott Young, Henry Ludwell Moore, Frank Knight, Jacob Viner, and Wesley Clair Mitchell) as one of the several \\"American saints in economics\\" born after 1860. Life Henry SchultzThe biographic information followes mainly Hotelling (1939). was born on September 4, 1893 in a Polish Jewish family in Sharkawshchyna, in the Russian Empire (now part of Belarus). \\" Schultz's family - father, mother (Rebecca Kissin) with their 2 sons - Henry and his brother Joseph moved to New York City in the United States. Henry Schultz completed his primary education, as well as undergraduate studies at the College of the City of New York, receiving a BA in 1916. For graduate work, Henry Schultz enrolled at Columbia University, but had to interrupt studies in 1917 because of World War I. After the war he received a scholarship which enabled him to spend 1919 at the London School of Economics and the Galton Laboratory of University College London, where he had the opportunity to attend Karl Pearson's lectures on statistics. After returning to the US, in 1920 Schultz married to Bertha Greenstein. In the future years, the couple had two daughters, Ruth and Jean. Schultz continued studying for his doctoral degree at Columbia, while at the same time conducting statistical work for the War Trade Board, the United States Census Bureau and the United States Department of Labor. He was awarded a PhD in economics from Columbia in 1925 with a thesis entitled Estimation of Demand Curves, written under the supervision of Henry L. Moore. In 1926, Schultz went to the University of Chicago, where he spent the rest of his career teaching and doing research. In 1930, he was one of the sixteen founding members of the Econometric Society. Henry Schultz died on November 26, 1938, near San Diego, California, in a car accident that also killed his wife and his two daughters. Work Led by his belief that economics needs rigorous quantitative study to become a science,Hotelling (1939). Henry Schultz was one of the founders of mathematical and statistical economics. His research was centered around a large program dedicated to the theory and estimation of private demand for goods functions, a project which started in the early 1920s, during his studies at the University of Chicago, and was completed shortly before his death with the publication of his book, The Theory and Measurement of Demand. =Selected publications= * and XXXIII (6): 577‚Äì637.

Schultz also influenced Milton Friedman, who was his student and, for a year, his research assistant.Milton Friedman, \\"Autobiography\\", in Nobel Lectures, Economics 1969-1980, Editor Assar Lindbeck, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1992. Schultz started a mathematical economics school at the University of Chicago which, after his death, was in danger to disappear. This prompted the University to invite the Cowles Commission, which had a research agenda focused on empirical economics, to move its headquarters there. As a result, the Commission moved to the University of Chicago in 1939 and Theodore O. Yntema, one of Schultz's students, was named as its new president.Cowles Commission, \\"Economic Theory and Measurement. A Twenty Year Research Report 1932‚Äì1952\\".

Born in London to George Riley, Sr., a well- educated bookseller, and Margaret Raby, he was the younger brother of Alexander Riley and the first person in his family to be interested by colonial life, moving to Calcutta and trading between Canton and Australia. William Rubinstein listed Edward Riley as being Australia's ninth richest man ever in Australian history in terms of current GDP Value.Rubinstein, W. The All Time Australian 200 Rich List. 2004, Allen and Unwin, Crows Nest, NSW Riley began his career as a merchant shipping rum, clothing and food from Calcutta, India to his brother, Alexander and Richard Jones in New South Wales. Riley Street in Sydney is named after Edward Riley.  Marriage and Family  Riley married Ann Moran in 1805 in Calcutta, India. Their first son, Edward, was born in Calcutta in 1806 and a second son, George Riley by 1810. Ann Riley (n√©e Moran) died in Calcutta on 13 May 1810. Riley remarried in 1813 to Ann Wilkinson, the daughter of a Colonel in Calcutta. Edward and Ann left India on the brig Guide to settle in New South Wales, arriving in Sydney in May 1816 on the Lynx, after first spending a couple of months in Hobart Town where Edward's sister, Elizabeth Fenn Kemp (n√©e Riley) lived with her husband, Anthony Fenn Kemp, and family. Edward and Ann (n√©e Wilkinson) had five children, Anna Sophia (1816 - 10 May 1881), Alexander William (born 1817), James John (11 September 1821 - 20 August 1882), Charles (born 1822) and Frances Elizabeth (born 21 August 1824).  New South Wales  In August 1817, Riley was appointed to be a member of the Governor's Court. In February 1818, he was elected as a Director of the Bank of New South Wales, resigning this position in January 1819. In February 1821, Riley was appointed as a Magistrate for the Territory of New South Wales. Edward and his family were living at Ultimo House, once the home of Surgeon John Harris and regarded as one of the finest houses in the colony, when son, James John, and daughter, Frances Elizabeth, were born in 1821 and 1824 respectively. An article in The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser of 1 July 1824 entitled \\"The Fashionable World\\" reported that at Ultimo House that evening \\"the present occupant of Ultimo, EDWARD RILEY, Esq. gives a magnificent entertainment to a very large Assembly. Mr. RILEY is on the eve of removing to his charming and picturesque retreat of Wooloomooloo.\\"  Death  On 21 February 1825, Riley committed suicide. His death was reported in The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser of Thursday, 24 February 1825 as follows: \\"Death.

His excavations at Pompeii helped preserve the city. Biography Fiorelli was born on 7 June 1823 in Naples. His initial work at Pompeii was completed in 1848. He was then imprisoned for some time because his radical approach to archaeology and strong nationalist feelings landed him in trouble with the king of Naples, Ferdinand II. During his time as a political prisoner, he produced a three volume work entitled History of Pompeian Antiques (1860‚Äì64). He subsequently became professor of archaeology at Naples University and director of excavations (1860‚Äì75), serving concurrently as director of the Naples National Archaeological Museum from 1863. As director of the Pompeii excavation Fiorelli introduced an entirely new system for the project. Instead of uncovering the streets first, in order to excavate the houses from the ground floor up, he imposed a system of uncovering the houses from the top down ‚Äî a better way of preserving everything that was discovered. In this way the data collected during the excavations could be used to help with the restoration of the ancient buildings and of their interiors ‚Äî although the most important wall paintings and mosaics still continued to be stripped and transported to Naples. Fiorelli also took the topography of the town and divided it into a system of 'regiones', 'insulae' and 'domus,' a form of reference still in use today. Fiorelli is best known for his plaster casts (calchi), produced by a process named after him: the Fiorelli process. He realized that where a corpse or other organic material had been buried in ash, it had rotted over time, leaving a cavity. Whenever an excavator discovered such a cavity, plaster of Paris was poured in and left to harden. The ash around the plaster was then carefully removed, so that a plaster replica of a person or animal at the moment of their death remained. This process gave information about how people had died in the eruption, what they were doing in their final moments and what sort of clothing they wore. Fiorelli was notable for his welcoming attitude to foreign scholars. He founded a training school where foreigners as well as Italians could learn archaeological technique, and made a particular study of the materials and building methods used in Pompeii. During his tenure many notable scholars came to study the remains of Pompeii. These included August Mau, in 1882, who created a system for categorizing the Pompeian pictures into a range of decorative styles. Mau's work still provides the standard framework for the study of these ancient Roman paintings. In 1875 Fiorelli became director general of Italian Antiquities and Fine Arts, serving in this position until his death two decades later. His work at Pompeii was continued by Michele Ruggiero, Giulio De Petra, Ettore Pais and Antonio Sogliano, who began to restore the roofs of the houses with wood and tiles in order to protect the remaining wall paintings and mosaics inside. Fiorelli died of undetermined causes on 28 January 1896 in Naples.

Manufactured by Arrow Development, the ride opened on May 23, 1978, with a unique feature at the time. Both tracks interlocked at their vertical loop element. The ride's popularity declined in the mid-to-late 1980s, and a fatal incident occurred in 1987. The ride had limited operation when it reopened later that year and was eventually dismantled in 1992. History Lightnin' Loops was built in 1977 and opened in 1978 at Six Flags Great Adventure. Six Flags had acquired the park in 1977 and Lightnin' Loops was planned by the prior ownership as far back as 1976. It was the second looping roller coaster on the east coast, although several full circuit looping coasters were in operation as far back as 1975. The coaster was located on the west side of the park that is currently occupied by Movietown, Batman: The Ride, and Nitro. Lightnin' Loops was the first roller coaster to feature interlocking loops, a feature that would eventually be repeated on Loch Ness Monster at Busch Gardens Williamsburg and the Orient Express at Worlds of Fun. However Lightnin' Loops was the world's only interlocking dual shuttle shuttle loop coaster. Lightnin' Loops featured a launch system that propelled the train downward into the loop and to another launch station at the same height as the loading station. Then the train was launched backwards returning to the loading station. This coaster continued to be the star attraction at the park throughout the 1980s, although other coasters such as Rolling Thunder (built in 1979), Sarajevo Bobsleds (built in 1984) and Ultra Twister (built in 1986) also were major coasters. The popularity of Lightnin' Loops faded in 1989 when the bobsleds were replaced with a multiple looping full circuit then-state of the art roller coaster called the Great American Scream Machine (also built by Arrow), which featured seven inversions, three of which were loops. Also unpopular was the high stair-climb to reach the Loops loading station. By 1990, the area that Lightnin' Loops was occupying became a dull area of the park due to the lack of theming. Nearby, however Adventure Rivers would be added in 1991. A new stunt show arena was built next to Lightnin' Loops, and the area was transformed in \\"Action Town\\". In May 1992, management announced that Lightnin' Loops would close at the end of July, and it was dismantled in August. One of the loops would be sold to Funtime Parks, the other loop would move to the site formerly occupied by Ultra Twister and construction of \\"Batman The Ride\\" would begin on the site of the space occupied by Lightnin' Loops. Batman: The Ride lead to the conversion of the area into Movietown. At the end of 1992, however, it was decided that the both tracks of Lightnin' Loops would be sold to Funtime Parks. Lightnin' Loops was then sent to two different parks then owned by Funtime. The one track was sent to Frontier City near Oklahoma City. It was rebuilt and reopened in 1994 and now known as the Diamond Back. It still operates there today. The other track was sent to Adventure World in Largo, Maryland (near Washington, D.C.). It was rebuilt and reopened in 1994 as the Python. Funtime Parks was coincidentally sold to Premier Parks in 1995. In 1998, Premier would buy Six Flags, bringing these two tracks formerly known as Lightning Loops back into the Six Flags family. Adventure World was renamed Six Flags America in 1999, and the Python was disassembled and put in storage to make room for more modern roller coasters and attractions. Frontier City was sold along with several other smaller Six Flags parks to PARC Management. Diamond Back still operates as the only Lightnin' Loop track still in operation. The track that was sold to Six Flags America and became Python was scrapped in 2005 after nearly 5 years in storage. Diamond Back was the Lightnin' Loops shuttle with the lower loop, while Python was the shuttle in the upper loop. Accidents On June 17, 1987, a 19-year-old woman from Chester, Pennsylvania fell to her death as a result of not being properly secured by the over-the-shoulder harness. She was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital with Basilar skull fracture suffered from the fall. Early reports indicated that the woman tried to board late after the safety harness was locked and the attendant couldn't stop the train. An investigation found the ride itself to be operating properly, but that an error was made by the ride operator, who started the ride without ensuring all passengers were secured. The park was fined the state maximum of $1,000, and the ride reopened on October 10, 1987.

Life and career The son of John Matheson Esq of Ardross and Attadale, Ross-shire, the family's ancestral seat, Alexander left home at an early age to trade in the Far East. Matheson was a nephew of Sir James Matheson of Lewis, the famous Jardine & Matheson Co, making his fortune from trading opium in the Far East, notably in the Canton and Hong Kong.http://www.scottish- places.info/people/famousfirst2295.html Matheson was the nephew of Sir James Matheson, 1st Baronet, and made a partner in the family firm of Jardine Matheson, and a matrilinear nephew of Lt-Col. Thomas Matheson. Educated at Edinburgh University, he knew enough economics to become a Director of the Bank of England. He also served as a magistrate, and was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the counties of Ross and Cromarty and Invernesshire.William Anderson, The Scottish Nation: Or the Surnames, Families, Literature ..., Volume 3. Having retired from trade in 1839 he made a land deal purchasing the Ardintoul estate, with more land acquired at Inverinate on Loch Duich in 1844. To his own disappointment he was not a successful farmer on the sparsely- populated lochside, but proved a developer and builder. Matheson was elected as MP for Inverness Burghs in 1847, on repeal of the corn laws. From 1849 his London home was at no.16 South Audley Street, near Park Lane and joined the Reform Club on The Mall. He succeeded his uncle, as Liberal MP for Ross and Cromarty from 1868.Iain Fraser Grigor, Highland Resistance: The Radical Tradition In The Scottish North In 1851 he added to his local status as an MP by purchasing the feudal barony of Lochalsh, which had remained dormant since 1427. The estate comprised lands on the left bank of Loch Ness purchased in 1850s: and the ruins of Eilean Donan Castle, later sold by the second baronet. He built Ardross House and Ardross Street on the west side of Inverness. To the north of the town he built Perceval Street. Historian A Clark speculated that the \\"poppies adorning\\" the gatehouse at Ardross were proof of involvement in the opium trade.A.Clark (2011) 'Pomegranates, opium, and poppycock', Northern History corresp. 107, cites Ewen A. Cameron (2010) 'Scotland's Global Impact' vol.1, issue 1, p.3-11. He was responsible for building in the small village, and developing the Skye railhead at the Kyle from Dingwall. In the 1860s Sir Alexander built another home at Duncraig Castle. By 1862, Matheson was Chairman of the Northern Railway, making it the largest in the Highlands. He joined up with Joseph Mitchell to extend the line to Dingwall, the directors dispensing with his services by 1867. The line finally opened on 1 August 1870. During the following decades Matheson evicted tenants from his more fertile Easter Ross estates. Riots broke out at Plockton, on one occasion resulting in ten arrests. Matheson posted extra guards on the Highland Railway sacking all his employees involved in the protests. By 1893, largely through Sir Alexander's influence the Kyle had replaced Plockton as the district's administrative centre.Alister Farquhar Matheson, Scotland's Northwest Frontier: A Forgotten British Borderland, Troubadour publishing, 2014 He supported William Ewart Gladstone's remarkable Midlothian campaign, but remained critical of Munro-Ferguson's utterances on Home Rule for Scotland. As Chairman of the Dingwall and Skye railway he effected a merger with the Highland railway on 2 August 1880. The result was that his concern held sway over the network across the highlands from Inverness to the sea at Skye.H.A. Vallance, Highland Railways, David & Charles, London, 2nd ed., 1963 On 15 May 1882 he was created a Baronet, of Lochalsh in the County of Ross.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/period.aspx?period=9 When the Napier Commission arrived in 1883-4 for an extensive tour of the affected areas in the Highlands, they were met by Matheson at the Kyle of Lochalsh. The Crofters Holdings Act 1886 enfranchised the tenantry for the first time entitling them to be included in the settlement south of the border; an unprecedented Crofters Party was formed to stand for Parliament. Family Matheson married three times: His first marriage was to Mary, only daughter of J.C. Macleod Esq., of Geanses in 1840. His second marriage in 1853 was to the Hon. Lavinia Mary, daughter of Thomas Stapleton, by Mary Gerard, and sister of 8th Lord Beaumont, they had a son and daughter. Kenneth James 2nd baronet of Lochalsh (1854-1920) and Mary Isabella (1855-1933) Thirdly he married Eleanor Irving, daughter of Spencer Perceval Esq., of Portman Square, London and Anna Eliza Macleod on 17 April 1860.

Legacy History has adjudged Sir Alexander and his uncle, Sir James Matheson as benevolent landlords but when the estate was sold in 1919 by Sir Kenneth, 2nd Baronet, he was the last of the ancient clan bloodline of duthchas to own the wilderness of Wester Ross the Balmacara estate. Sir Alexander was an energetic and dynamic entrepreneur who drove forward the industrial revolution. Despite this the population remained small and, isolated without growth, had shrunk by 1901.

Much of the inspiration for the Society came from the earlier Circle of Friends of the Medallion, which also issued medals on a semi-annual basis from 1908 to 1915.

Many of the early contributors to the Society of Medalists were prominent American sculptors of the first half of the 20th century. Lee Lawrie was well known for modernistic art-deco works like the Statue of Atlas in New York City and the Sower atop the Nebraska State Capitol, while artists like Lorado Taft represented a more classical ethos. Others concentrated more, although not exclusively, on medallic art, such as John Flanagan (designer of the Washington quarter dollar) and Laura Gardin Fraser. The artists who created the series represented a wide variety of styles and expertise. The Society of Medalists issues covered a wide variety of themes during its sixty-five years of existence. Because the artists were allowed to select their subject matter, many of the medals are topical. Those of the 1930s frequently serve as commentary on the experiences of the first World War, and anticipate the destruction of the second. Religion often serves as a theme, with interpretations of biblical scenes prevalent throughout all decades. Art, science, and nature also provided inspiration for artists and their medals'. With two exceptions, all issues of the Society of Medalists were initially manufactured in bronze. Issues 28 and 29, created during World War II, were first produced in silver. During the 1970s the Society undertook a program to restrike its earlier issues in silver. The advent of a spike in silver prices late in the decade, coupled with a low level of demand for the new issues, led to the demise of the silver restrike program by the early 1980s. The Society of Medalist represents an interesting and accessible collecting opportunity. All of the issues are available on the secondary market, with both specialized dealers and internet auction services serving as important sources. Collectors value the medals in their original boxes, complete with the descriptive pamphlets that accompanied them.

Hawks, and starring Glenn Ford, Red Buttons, and Taina Elg. The film, distributed by Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, is based on a short story of the same name by William Chamberlain. Plot In the aftermath of a big battle during World War II, US Brigadier General Charles Lane (Kent Smith), Master Sergeant Murphy \\"Murph\\" Savage (Glenn Ford), and Corporal Chan Derby (Red Buttons) find themselves cut off behind enemy lines. The general takes over a farmhouse belonging to annoyed Frenchwoman Simone (Taina Elg). Lane determines that there is a gap in the German lines and decides to organize a defense from whatever stragglers he can gather together. Shortly afterwards, however, he is killed saving Murph's life. The first American soldier to show up, Corporal Terry Sellers (Dean Jones), mistakes Murph for Lane (Murph is holding the general's helmet), giving him an idea. Recalling Lane's assessment that leadership is desperately needed to rally the disorganized troops, Murph masquerades as the general, with Derby and Simone's reluctant help. Murph manages to repulse a couple of attacks spearheaded by German tanks, all the while avoiding Private Orville Hutchmeyer (Tige Andrews), who knows Murph and holds a grudge against him. At the end of the engagement, Murph is knocked out by shrapnel, allowing him to \\"die\\" and resume his real identity. Cast * Glenn Ford as MSgt. Murphy Savage * Red Buttons as Cpl.

Each winner receives $2,500. The first award was given in 1972. The Awards recognize not only reporting about science, but also thoughtful work that probes the ethical problems and social effects of science. The awards are considered especially prestigious because they are judged by accomplished peers. Starting in 2009 the award categories were changed. The book category will remain unchanged, while the other categories will morph into \\"Commentary and Opinion,\\" \\"Science Reporting,\\" and \\"Local Science Reporting.\\" Except for the Book category, the awards will be platform independent, which means that they may be magazine, radio, TV, or web-based.

Founded in 1974, it is one of several fee-funded organizations on campus, and broadcasts online through its web site and on the University of Houston's Cougar Philo cable network. Station history SVN began broadcasting in 1974 from one of the former facilities for Houston PBS member station KUHT. In 1985, KUHT reclaimed the building and the student operated television station was shut down. Several members of that organization decided to pull resources together and create their own student operated video network on campus. They decided to work under Campus Activities to increase their chance of survival. In the early 1990s students were able to come to the Student Video Network and create their own productions that were then aired on a closed-circuit television station available to all students living in on-campus housing. Student Video Network started to come to prominence on campus during the mid 1990s, beginning under the leadership of Eden S. Blair who served as Chair from 1993 - 1995. Purchasing an AVID editing machine before the Communications Department meant SVN became a training ground for students who wanted to learn how to edit using industry standard equipment. Blair opted not to go for a third year as Chair and was followed by Nicole Redo for the 1995 - 1996 school year. Redo continued the relationship with the Dean of Students office maintaining the UH News program. She also expanded SVN's community involvement by televising a live debate between candidates for Student Association President and allowing parties to air commercials. In 2001, Tropical Storm Allison flooded out the entire studio, damaging equipment, software, and the SVN facilities beyond repair. In 2003, University of Houston's Campus Activities decided to restart the program, only playing new video releases with the future intent of bringing back student productions. In 2006, Gus Forward, a Business Administration undergrad, worked with Campus Activities advisors as the first President of the relaunched organization. Gus enabled students to work on original productions and increased the production equipment inventory of the TV station. In the summer of 2007, Gus Forward stepped down and Tommy Lee Kirby, a Media Production undergrad, took over and worked on increasing operating space and continued to obtain new video equipment. Also during Tommy‚Äôs tenure, the Outdoor Movie Festival was started by Commercial Director, Jeremy Malhotra. The Outdoor Movie Festival showcases newly released and classic movies in various venues on campus and is open for all students and staff to attend. Past venues include the Lynn Eusan Park on campus and the UC North Patio. SVN collaborates with other Campus Activities organizations and student groups to provide popcorn, snacks, drinks, and raffle giveaways to attendees. At the start of the 2008 school year, Luis Gonzalez assumed the position of SVN President after being the Vice President under Tommy Lee Kirby. Under his tenure, Luis restructured the organization for better efficiency and established a relationship with the UH School of Theatre & Dance. His Vice President of Operations, Cole Calza, worked extensively with the Jack J. Valenti School of Communication to help strengthen the relationship between the two organizations. Cole also pushed hard to increase the funding granted to SVN from Campus Activities. The Vice President of Public Relations, Hammad Ahmed, worked with UH Athletics to establish an agreement which allowed SVN to broadcast copyrighted game footage on the campus TV channel. In addition, he expanded the size and scope of the, now semi-annual, Outdoor Movie Festival. During his tenure, Hammad also initiated his vision to bring a World Trade Center Memorial to the University of Houston. This vision was finally realized with the help of the UH Student Government Association in January 2014. The memorial sits in the Reflection Garden in front of the UC South Theatre entrance. In October 2009, when Luis resigned from his post, Viral Bhakta became the new President of SVN. He increased the educational and production aspects of the organization for its members and the university. He established weekly production classes to give members hands of training and created various production, pre-production, and post production guidelines. With this came the opportunity for show producers to better attain marketing and props for their shows. In 2010, Viral was reselected to serve as the SVN President for another year. Also joining the SVN team was Ali Iqbal, who is the owner and photographer at (Color Digital Studios), as the SVN Production Manager. Viral went on to establish relationships with movie marketing companies Allied Integrated Marketing and Moroch Marketing which brought internship opportunities inside the industry for SVN members. Student Video Network continues to showcase the semi-annual Outdoor Movie Festival. In 2014, the brand ‚ÄúCoogTV‚Äù was established. It marks the name of the channel/platform. As of the Fall Semester of 2016, the name of the organization was changed from Student Video Network to CoogTV in order to prevent confusion. At the start of the 2017 school year, Soheil Nanjee assumed the position of Executive Producer position at CoogTV after the restructure in 2016. CoogTV currently has 15 active shows and over 150 active creators. Productions Students must submit a production proposal form for their idea to be reviewed. If approved, students utilize the SVN studio to tape their show or use the equipment to tape out of the studio. They use the Control room for the postproduction of their show or commercial to finish their project. Shows taped in studio are linearly taped to Final Cut Pro to be edited. Out of studio shows are non-linearly taped on to Mini DV tapes. SVN offers various production forms to help students have a guideline from the very beginning of production to broadcasting the final product. =Production process= :Production Guidelines :This guideline helps outline deadlines for specific for document, copyrights, censorship, producer policies, and management during pre-production to post-production.

Green Lake Crew (GLC) is a public rowing club in Seattle, Washington (USA), jointly sponsored by the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department and the Rowing Advisory Council. The program is located on the southern shore of Green Lake at the Green Lake Small Craft Center (GLSCC). Green Lake Crew was chartered in 1947 and first went \\"on the water\\" in the spring of 1948. GLC created GLC was created through the joint effort of community leaders from the Boys' Club of Seattle, the Seattle Times, and the University of Washington, working with professional staff of the Seattle Parks Department. Their collaboration culminated in the creation of both GLC and the Seattle Junior Rowing Commission. The latter body had as its mission organizing the efforts of program participants and other volunteers to support growth of \\"junior rowing\\" in the area. Originally a program for high school-age boys, it became open to girls and boys in 1963. With junior crew growing in popularity throughout the region, the Parks Department in 1984 created the Rowing Advisory Council (RAC) as the focal point of volunteer efforts to support GLC. Adult crew, i.e., \\"masters rowing,\\" was initiated at Green Lake that same year. Hosting of regattas Green Lake is a hub of rowing in the Pacific Northwest, as it hosts three regular regattas annually. The Spring Regatta is traditionally the year's first major rowing event in the region, with as many as 1,200 junior and masters athletes of all ages competing. GLC's Summer Extravaganza is a more relaxed event, traditionally the last major regatta of the summer. The event is the first major rowing competition for many of the novice and beginning rowers who are introduced to the sport during GLSCC summer classes. The Frostbite Regatta, a forty-year-old tradition, is the third major event hosted annually by GLC. It shares the last weekend of fall racing in the Northwest with the Lake Washington Rowing Club's annual Head of the Lake regatta. For many participants, this is an intense weekend where they race the 1000-meter course on Saturday at Green Lake, and then the three-mile head-race on Lake Washington the next day. Other hosted events Beyond the three regattas annually hosted by the RAC at Green Lake, GLC intermittently hosts a variety of events of regional and national import. For instance, Green Lake in the summer of 2006 teamed with its sister-organization, Mt. Baker Rowing , to host USRowing's Masters National Championship regatta. Green Lake was the site for the United States Women's National Rowing Association's national championships in 1969, 1972, 1978, and 1985. The Collegiate Women's National Championships were held on Green Lake in 1984. With its protected water and diverse inventory of rowing equipment, Green Lake also routinely figures prominently in the development and selection of the country's premier junior rowers. GLC co-hosted (with the University of Washington) the Junior Women's National Team Selection Camp in 2000 and 2001. The Junior Men's National Selection Camp was co-hosted by Green Lake in 1990. Green Lake regularly hosts summer ‚Äúdevelopment camps‚Äù that serve as the vehicle from which Northwest junior athletes are groomed for further participation on a national level. GLC in competition Green Lake Crew established its tradition of competitive excellence at the highest levels in 1959 when a coxed four of junior rowers earned the right to compete at the U.S. National Championships (i.e. not ‚ÄúJunior Nationals,‚Äù but ‚ÄúNationals‚Äù) in Chicago. This crew not only won a gold medal in this event, but subsequently represented the United States at the Pan American Games in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, where they rowed home first in that competition as well. That boat was nominated by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer for its \\"Man of the Year in Sports\\" award in 1959.

It is also the third live album released, and the only double album released by Cluster.

It was released on February 25, 1997. First Encounter Tour 1996 was Cluster's only release for the Purple Pyramid label. The music of First Encounter Tour 1997 flows from one music style to the next and reflects all the varieties of Cluster's music from the 1979 release Gro√ües Wasser onwards. Some sections of the longer tracks do seem to break new musical ground for Cluster, with deeply atmospheric ambient music leading into sections with a definite melody and beat. Each track is named for the city or cities in which the concerts took place, with the sole exception of the last track which is named for guest musicians Bond Bergland and The Brain (the duo of Paul M. Fox and Tommy Grenas), which was recorded in Anderson, Indiana and Chicago, Illinois. Much of the music is improvisational but some set pieces were included. For example, the track \\"Portland Oregon #2\\" is a live performance of \\"Emmental\\" from the 1991 release Apropos Cluster.

Chadbourne was the founder of the law firm today known as Chadbourne & Parke. Established in New York City in 1902 as Chadbourne, Babbit & Wallace, the firm underwent a 1924 merger, to become Chadbourne, Stanchfield, & Levy, before taking on its current name. Chadbourne and Parke is consistently ranked among the top 100 law firms in the world. At the time of his death, Chadbourne served as board chairman of the International Mining Corporation and was a director of some 20 corporations. He had amassed a fortune, and was regarded by some contemporaries as a \\"radical capitalist\\" for his views on profit sharing and recognition of collective bargaining rights. Early life and career Chadbourne was born March 21, 1871 in Houghton, Michigan to Thomas Lincoln Chadbourne, Sr.,Autobiography, p. 295 a lawyer and Harvard graduate, and Georgina Kay Chadbourne.Autobiography, p. 2 He describes himself in his autobiography as having been a \\"twelve pound baby\\".Autobiography, p. 5 He is described as a rambunctious youth, having run away from home at age three before being expelled from a series of schools throughout his young life as a \\"bad influence\\".Autobiography, p. 1 \\"By the time I was twelve,\\" Chadbourne states, \\"I had become a crack pool player ‚Äì the infallible sign of worthlessness\\". At age six, Chadbourne witnessed the death of his sister Eliza, called \\"Leila.\\" She was a toddler aged three, and died after running through two panes of glass and sustaining severe cuts.Autobiography, pp. 3-4 He describes the event as a graphic and horrific experience. At age nineteen, Chadbourne was turned out of the house by his parents. His father left him at the train station bound for Chicago with $150 and the advice that he was \\"not fitted for a profession or any other work in life that calls for mental effort\\" and should go into manual labor.Autobiography, p. 15 Chadbourne took a series of night jobs including one as a police officer.Autobiography, p. 18 before being hired by Judge Russell Wing at the law firm Wing and Carter.Autobiography, p. 21 Despite never attending law school, Chadbourne's training under Judge Wing left him well prepared for the state bar exam, which he passed with a ranking of two out of 35. Chadbourne founded the law firm Eschweiler and Chadbourne with a cousin in Milwaukee before going on to found the prestigious Chadbourne, Babbit & Wallace, which survives today as Chadbourne and Parke.Autobiography, p. 27 Family Chadbourne married his first wife, Emily Crane Chadbourne November 1896.Autobiography, p. 33, 295 The two separated in 1899 and formally divorced seven years later.Autobiography, p. 59 Then he married his second wife, Grace Wassall Chadbourne, in November 1906.Autobiography, p. 59, 295 Chadbourne regarded Grace as the love of his life and the two traveled extensively. Chadbourne adopted her son LeRoy.Autobiography, p. 60, 228 Grace suffered from cancer in 1918 and died in May 1919.Autobiography, p. 164 He took a third wife, Marjorie Curtis Chadbourne on January 15, 1921.Autobiography, p. 169, 295 The couple had two daughters, MarjorieAutobiography, p. 227 and Leila,Autobiography, p. 228 named after Chadbourne's deceased sister. Great Depression Chadbourne represented some of the largest firms in the world in a period of globalization during the 1920s during which multi-national corporations began to be established in significant numbers. Following the 1929 crash, he summed up his own responsibility thus: \\"The capitalistic system is on trial. If we think the people who are running the industries of this world can by reason of greed bring about such a depression as this and not take steps to mend it, no matter what sacrifice may be to individuals, we are mistaken. We can't get away with it.\\" Representing a consortium of sugar producers in an attempt to stabilize world sugar prices during the Great Depression, the Chadbourne Committee, meeting in Brussels under the leadership of Thomas Chadbourne, secured an agreement between several nations to reduce production and establish export quotas. (Yale ) Signatories included Cuba, Java, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and an initially reluctant Germany. Production was to be curtailed by 15% and held at that level over a five-year period. Chadbourne planned additional negotiations with countries that consumed but produced little to no sugar, in an attempt to stop them from entering the market. These included Great Britain, France, Yugoslavia, Argentina, and Japan. By the time this agreement was reached, in May 1931, the worldwide sugar surplus had reached an estimated 3.5 million tons (ibid.) and prices had fallen from a pre-Depression level of 7 cents per pound to just one and one half cents per pound. Low prices of commodities, including sugar, depressed wages within the US, and perpetuated crises in Caribbean single-commodity producing nations. The situation is cited as a key factor inciting the revolution in Cuba that would ultimately result in the ouster of the Machado government. To alleviate misgivings from impoverished consumers in his native United States, Chadbourne stressed that the maneuver would serve to restore prices paid by refineries to sugar producers, but would not affect retail prices. Some contemporaries took exception at this claim. Among these, some observers recognized a need to restore prices even at the expense of consumers, while others condemned the practice as protecting domestic business profits while exacerbating public hardship. Concerns were expressed that farm yields were failing to cover production costs, and farm foreclosures were pervasive during this period. Yet despite successfully limiting production among signatories, Chadbourne was unable to effect a return to pre-Depression prices because US producers increased cultivation and continued to flood the market. At the same time, India doubled its sugar exports from some 3,000,000 tons in 1930 to 6,000,000 tons in 1935. Neither the United States nor the United Kingdom participated in the Chadbourne Committee discussions. Citing inadequate means to compel other farmers to adhere to quotas, US producers had already refused to accept production caps proposed by Chadbourne. Congress and the Roosevelt administration would respond to the ongoing crisis by adopting such compulsory measures, along with subsidies for farmers leaving land uncultivated, under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 and Jones‚ÄìCostigan amendment of 1934. Chadbourne argued for the creation of a \\"silver reserve system\\" wherein all countries would agree to hold a reserve stock (a bullion) of silver, and to produce coinage using a consistent portion of silver. The plan was conceived in response to silver devaluation, which Chadbourne attributed to countries \\"dumping\\" large amounts of silver on the world market, by reducing the amount of silver they used in coins. Chadbourne estimated that half the world's population held its wealth in silver. Those individuals saw their wealth steadily eroded with the growing worldwide silver surplus. The proposed system would work much in the same way as the Federal Reserve uses monetary policy. To stem inflation, Chadbourne asserted, nations could release stock of silver into the market from their reserves. The concept differs from Federal Reserve tools primarily in that a \\"bullion\\" is a stock measured in volume, rather than monetary value. Chadbourne hoped to change the trend whereby silver had become a commodity rather than a store of value. Politics Responding to the crisis of the Great Depression, Chadbourne asserted that the capitalist system itself was \\"on trial\\" (see above), and argued for the need for intervention by industrialists to curb the downturn. Chadbourne was an early champion of both collective bargaining rights and profit sharing for workers. Thomas Chadbourne was very active in the United States Democratic Party. Chadbourne was a major supporter of Alfred E. Smith, the Governor of New York. Chadbourne donated $30,000 to Smith's campaign officially,Lundberg, F: America's 60 families, Halcyon House, 1939 and allegedly provided over $400,000 of cash and stock options to Smith secretly.Margolick, D: \\"Deleted from Book: Gifts to Alfred E. Smith\\", New York Times, May 22, 1985, p. A1 Chadbourne carried on a correspondence with president Woodrow Wilson over the course of 1917 to 1921, much of which is reprinted in Chadbourne's autobiography. Chadbourne sat on the War Trade Board, from which he resigned, despite urgings from the president to stay, in order to attend his ailing wife.Autobiography, p. 161 Chadbourne is listed as a top contributor to the \\"Graphic Founders Fund,\\" which gave financial support to the monthly publication Survey Graphic, an offshoot of The Survey magazine. Survey Graphic published articles on fascism and anti-Semitism, and is perhaps best known for its role in the Harlem Renaissance. Globalization An early adherent of modern globalization, Chadbourne criticized isolationists and emphasized the necessity of world trade in establishing and sustaining American affluence: \\"Only the blind can fail to see that distance has been annihilated, geographical barriers smashed down, and that it is now an interlocked and absolutely interdependent world in which we live. [T]he prosperity of the United States is dependent upon world trade. Our production, farm and factory, has been developed to a point where it is from ten to twenty per cent in excess of domestic demand, and any failure to find foreign markets for this surplus means the dislocation of our whole industrial establishment.\\" =Trade barriers= Chadbourne railed against the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff: \\"How have we gone about the business of protecting and promoting the world trade so vital to our prosperity? We pass the highest tariff bill in history‚Ä¶and with what result? Already some forty- five nations have raised tariff walls of their own in direct retaliation.\\" =The dangers of financial crisis= Calling for a moratorium of European debt repayments from World War I, Chadbourne issued a prescient warning in 19 that war would follow financial crisis. Chadbourne's law partner, Louis S. Levy, was disbarred in 1939 for arranging a bribe of almost $250,000 to Federal judge Martin T. Manton.\\"Borrowing Judge\\", Time, February 6, 1939 Chadbourne died June 15, 1938 in Manhattan after suffering a heart attack on his yacht.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759879,00.html Notes References * 1871 births 1938 deaths American lawyers Michigan Wolverines football players ","title":"Thomas Chadbourne"},{"id":"12848229","text":"Danan may refer to: * Danan, one of the three volcanic cones on the island of Krakatoa; * Danan (woreda), a district in eastern Ethiopia * Danan, Ethiopia, the town the district in Ethiopia is named for * D√¢nan, small town in Djibouti * Danan, Iran, a village in Kurdistan Province, Iran People with the surname * Paul Danan (born 1978), English actor See also * For the people Danaan, see Tuatha D√© Danann ","title":"Danan (disambiguation)"},{"id":"12848273","text":"Bill Hoest's Agatha Crumm (July 12, 1981) Agatha Crumm is a newspaper comic strip created by the cartoonist Bill Hoest (creator of The Lockhorns) and distributed by King Features Syndicate.

Comics historian Don Markstein described the active and agile Crumm: :Agatha may not have been as wealthy as Scrooge McDuck or Richie Rich, and maybe not even Rich Uncle Pennybags. But as owner of the Crumm Cookie Company, she was probably in the range of Mr. Abernathy, and that's about as wealthy as most toons need to be‚Äîeven when they're financing a lifestyle that includes a lot of corporate wheeling and dealing. The seven-day comic strip where Agatha was introduced debuted from King Features Syndicate on Monday, October 24, 1977. (A report elsewhere, that she'd begun exactly two months earlier, is apparently in error, as August 24, 1977, was a Wednesday.) She was old enough to rival Uncle Elby or Grandma, but spry, very active in the world of high-finance shenanigans.Agatha Crumm at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

In North America, the track was released as the featured single from the soundtrack on 24 August 1999 to alternative radio airplay. \\"Identify\\" also appears on the Taiwanese edition of Imbruglia's debut studio album Left of the Middle, and later, was placed as a bonus track on the Japanese version of her greatest hits compilation, Glorious: The Singles 97‚Äì07, and later on the international digital version. Billy Corgan originally wrote the song from a female protagonist perspective, with Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson in mind for the song, but her management turned the song down without her ever hearing it. \\"The idea of doing the title song came from trying to do something a little different. Back in the day, people tried to write a song that was directly connected to a movie's score,\\" Corgan told Billboard, \\"So the music for \\"Identify\\" came from one of the love scenes in the movie\\". Critical reception Billboard reviewer Chuck Taylor described \\"Identify\\" as a \\"moody, dreamlike gem\\", adding \\"there's a hint of Portishead here, an inkling of a James Bond theme, and a morsel showing Imbruglia's own growth. This is good stuff and far too credible for radio to dismiss... this could be the sleeper hit of the season.\\" In terms of the Stigmata soundtrack, Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic gave the song the following review: \\"It's unfortunate that the entire album wasn't entirely instrumental, since it would have been a more satisfying listen. That's not to say that the first half of the album is terrible ‚Äì there's quite a few good songs there, actually, highlighted by Bj√∂rk's \\"All is Full of Love\\", Afro Celt Sound System & Sinead O'Connor's \\"Release,\\" and the Corgan-Garson written and Natalie Imbruglia performance \\"Identify.\\" Music video The music video for \\"Identify\\" was directed by Samuel Bayer, known for his clips for Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins and Garbage and sees Imbruglia performing the song in a dark, broody style cavern, surrounded by ghosts and tombs.

On August 20, 2007, the Boeing 737-800 aircraft operating the flight caught fire and exploded after landing and taxiing to the gate area at Naha Airport. Four people‚Äîthree from the aircraft and one ground crew‚Äîsustained injuries in the accident. B-18616; the aircraft involved in the accident Background The China Airlines aircraft, registration had been delivered in July 2002. Like other Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft, it was equipped with CFM56-7B26 engines. There were 157 passengers on board the aircraft, including 2 infants. Of the number, 110 passengers were from Taiwan, 23 were from Japan, and 24 were from other countries. The crew of eight were mostly Taiwanese, with one Japanese flight attendant. Accident sequence The plane landed normally at 10:26 a.m. local time and taxied to the gate area by 10:34. Ground crew noticed flames coming from engine number 2 as Captain You Chien-kou shut it down in anticipation of gate connection. Informed about the situation by air traffic controllers, the captain ordered an emergency evacuation. All passengers and flight attendants managed to leave the aircraft safely through the four hatches using slides. After the last flight attendant had fled from the right aft hatch, Captain You and First Officer Tseng Ta-wei, the last two people onboard, exited the aircraft through the cockpit window. The pilots attempted to use the cockpit escape rope to climb to the ground, but the first officer was knocked off the rope when the number 2 engine and right wing fuel tanks exploded, triggering a large fireball that consumed much of the fuselage. The captain subsequently leapt from the window without using the rope. Both pilots were uninjured and managed to run away from the plane. A statement from the airline confirmed that all passengers and crew members were evacuated safely. A 57-year-old Taiwanese man suffered from hypertension and an 8-year-old girl from Hong Kong felt unwell; both were sent to a hospital nearby. An airport ground crew member was hurt during evacuation on the ground, and a flight attendant, who was the last person to leave the cabin, fell over on the ground when the aircraft exploded. It took about four and a half minutes from when the fire was reported to the airport fire service until the start of fire fighting actions. Japanese regulations require a response time of three minutes or less. The delay was in part because the tower controller could not hear the fire crews' radioed requests for permission to use the taxiways to reach the fire - with no response, the fire crews decided to use the taxiways anyway without permission. The taxiways of Naha Airport were closed until 11:03 a.m. because of the incident. According to Naha Airport air traffic control, the status of the aircraft was normal in that there was no report of any abnormal situation during cruising or landing. Following the accident, the Republic of China Civil Aeronautics Administration grounded all 14 remaining Boeing 737-800s of China Airlines, Mandarin Airlines and the Republic of China Air Force for inspection of the fuel systems. The Japan Civil Aviation Bureau asked Japanese operators of 737-700 and 737-800 aircraft to similarly inspect their aircraft. No anomalies were found and the aircraft returned to service. Investigation The cause of the accident was investigated by the Aircraft and Railway Accidents Investigation Commission of Japan. The crew, as confirmed by the recording in the cockpit voice recorder, did not observe any abnormalities before the incident. The investigating team confirmed that the aircraft caught fire in the gate area and there was no sign of fuel leakage during taxiing to the gate. The investigation focused on the possibility that a fuel leak led to the fire. At a news conference on August 24, investigators revealed that a bolt, which had come loose from the slat track, had punctured the right wing fuel tank, creating a hole 2‚Äì3 centimetres in diameter. Aftermath China Airlines stated they would compensate passengers NT$1000 for every kilogram of luggage lost, for a maximum of NT$20,000 for checked-in pieces of luggage and another NT$20,000 maximum for carry-on luggage. In the stock trading after the accident, China Airlines stock fell along with Taiwan Fire & Marine Insurance Co. Due to the accident, on August 25, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered emergency inspections of wing leading-edge slat tracks on all Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft. The Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD) from the FAA requires operators to inspect the slat track downstop to check for missing parts, ensure proper installation, and check the inside of the slat can for foreign object debris and damage. The directive requires operators to inspect within 24 days and every 3000 flight cycles thereafter. Following feedback from completed inspections revealing loose parts in several other aircraft and one with a damaged slat can, the FAA issued a new emergency airworthiness directive on August 28. Airlines were then required to perform the inspection on Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft within 10 days instead of 24 days. In addition, the AD required a one-time torquing of the nut and bolt in the downstop assembly for the slat track within 24 days. On 28 August 2009, the Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB) published the results of the investigation. It is considered highly probable that this accident occurred through the following causal chain: When the aircraft retracted the slats after landing at Naha Airport, the track can that housed the inboard main track of the No. 5 slat on the right wing was punctured, creating a hole. Fuel leaked out through the hole, reaching the outside of the wing. A fire started when the leaked fuel came into contact with high-temperature areas on the right engine after the aircraft stopped in its assigned spot, and the aircraft burned out after several explosions. With regard to the cause of the puncture in the track can, it is certain that the downstop assembly having detached from the aft end of the above-mentioned inboard main track fell off into the track can, and when the slat was retracted, the assembly was pressed by the track against the track can and punctured it. With regard to the cause of the detachment of the downstop assembly, it is considered highly probable that during the maintenance works for preventing the nut from loosening, which the company carried out on the downstop assembly about one and a half months prior to the accident based on the service letter from the manufacturer of the aircraft, the washer on the nut side of the assembly was omitted, following which the downstop on the nut side of the assembly fell off and then the downstop assembly eventually fell off the track. It is considered highly probable that a factor contributing to the detachment of the downstop assembly was the design of the downstop assembly, which was unable to prevent the assembly from falling off if the washer is not installed. With regard to the detachment of the washer, it is considered probable that the following factors contributed to this: Despite the fact that the nut was in a location difficult to access during the maintenance works, neither the manufacturer of the aircraft nor the company had paid sufficient attention to this when preparing the service letter and engineering order job card, respectively. Also, neither the maintenance operator nor the job supervisor reported the difficulty of the job to the one who had ordered the job. The Japan Transport Safety Board recommended the Civil Aeronautics Administration of Taiwan to supervise China Airlines to take the following actions: When planning and implementing maintenance jobs, the scope of jobs should be fully ascertained and the working conditions and environments should be appropriately evaluated, and the countermeasures to prevent maintenance errors including the actions taken in 2009 against the recurrence of this accident should be steadfastly implemented and enhanced.

In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, however, other Algonquian tribes of the western Great Lakes region and upper Mississippi Valley frequently called them Outagami, using a Chippewa word meaning ‚ÄòPeople of the Opposite Shore.‚Äô In contrast, the French almost always referred to the Mesquakies as Renards, or ‚ÄòFoxes.‚Äô Almost 90 percent of the anthropological and historical references to the tribe also use the term Fox‚Ä¶since most anthropologists and historians use the term Fox, as do most library reference systems, we finally decided generally to use Fox when discussing our subject.\\" \\"Preface\\" in Edmunds, R. David and Joseph L. Peyser, The Fox Wars: The Mesquakie Challenge to New France (University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, 1993), xviii. These territories are known today as the states of Michigan and Wisconsin in the United States. The Wars exemplified colonial warfare in the transitional space of New France, occurring within the complex system of alliances and enmities with native peoples and colonial plans for expansion. The Fox controlled the Fox River system. This river was vital for the fur trade between French Canada and the North American interior, because it allowed river travel from Green Bay in Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River. The French wanted the rights to use the river system to gain access to both the Mississippi and trade contacts with tribes to the west. The wars claimed thousands of lives and initiated a slave trade whereby Fox Indians were captured by native allies of New France and then sold as slaves to the French colonial population. Indeed, alliances between the French and other native groups (such as Ottawa, Miamis and Sioux) as well as those between the Fox and other native groups (such as the Sauk, Mascoutens and Kickapoos) were an important aspect of the Wars, influencing every stage of the conflicts, including the causes, the fighting and the conclusion. The First Fox War (1712-1716) began with inter-alliance violence and ended with the surrender of a large group of Fox and the subsequent peace deal. As was custom, peace offerings required the exchange of goods and of prisoners to account for those who died in the conflict, acknowledging the importance of this exchange for establishing peace. The Second Fox War (1728-1733) was far more destructive than the first, and ended with the near annihilation of the Fox population. Prior to the Fox Wars The Fox Indians were living in eastern Wisconsin at the time of their first contacts with the French around 1670. The Fox unsuccessfully sought to establish themselves as middlemen between the French and the Sioux, one of their two traditional enemies, the other being the Ojibwas (Chippewas) in northern Wisconsin. Not only were the Fox unsuccessful, but prior to 1701, many wars between aboriginal people, which also included the French, against the Iroquois were ravaging the aboriginal lands of the Pays d'en Haut. The Iroquoian wars brought fear and urgency for the French to attempt to save what was left of their trade alliances. Their alliances were in jeopardy, and also, in 1697 the western posts were closed as a result of the termination by Louis XIV of the fur trade west of Montreal. Historian Richard White illustrates central Wisconsin at the end of the seventeenth century as \\"a vast refugee center, its situation constantly changing, nations socializing, cooperating, feuding, fighting, constantly adjusting their strategies to shift in French trading policy, which was always the dominant reality.\\" Thus, when the Peace Conference of 1701 finally took place in Montreal, the French were quick to establish a French protectorate in the Great Lakes region. Nevertheless, the question still remained as to how they would facilitate trade with their southern partners, when their main trading posts had been closed. From this point on, the Great Lakes region was going to be even more unstable. First Fox War After the Peace Conference of 1701, Antoine de Lamothe Cadillac resolved the trade issue by establishing a new fort, Fort Pontchartrain, at Detroit. This location was strategic, as it allowed access to the water trade routes, which were more accessible than Montreal, and the warpaths of the Great Lakes region. Despite enabling access to this region by establishing a fort, the French could not survive without the help of the aboriginal people. Governor Cadillac invited numerous tribes to settle in the area. Ottawa and Huron peoples established villages in the area, soon joined by the Potawatomi, Miamis, and Ojibwa. The population may have reached 6,000 at times. This was positive for the French, but their presence and the presence of the Fox would aggravate things in the region. Indigenous groups that were enemies lived fairly far apart, but in Detroit, they lived side by side competing for a concrete and practical relationship with the French. As French colonizers sought to enlarge their influence in the West, they sought to ally themselves with the Indians as commercial and military partners. At the time, French imperial policy had already privileged certain aboriginal tribes, in particular the Ojibwa-Ottawa-Potawatimi confederacy and the Illini confederacy in the south, and the Sioux were the next profitable alliance. The Wisconsin tribes (Fox, Sauk, Mascouten, Kickapoo and Winnebago), with the intention of dominating the post, prevented the French from having direct trade access to the Sioux. Concurrently, they would disrupt the lives of the Ottawas and Miamis near Detroit, as well as the French settlement. In the spring of 1712, a large group of Fox under Lamyma, a peace chief, and Pemoussa, a war chief, established villages in the area, including a fort with easy gunshot range of Portchartrain. The Fox outnumbered the French and Hurons. However, their luck changed with the arrival of 600 allied warrior under Ottawa war chief Saguima and Potawatomi chief Makisab√© which reversed the fighting situation. Jacques-Charles Renaud Dubuisson, who wanted the Fox removed from their village, had ordered these reinforcements. For nineteen days, the Fox fought and kept their footing with the French. After several days, the Fox asked for a ceasefire and returned some hostages; however, no ceasefire was granted. Several days later, another parley occurred, as the Fox tried to seek protection for the women and children. Dubuisson chose to let his allies decide their course; they chose to grant no mercy. After nineteen days, during a nighttime thunderstorm, the Fox escaped their village and fled north. The French-allied Indians cornered them near the head of the Detroit River and inflicted four more days of fighting. By the end of the siege and pursuit, around 1000 Foxes and Mascouten men, women and children were killed (including many of the captives). The French lost 30 men, and their allies had 60 fatalities. It was not until 1726, with the arrival of Charles de Beauharnois de La Boische, that the Fox and French actually achieve peace. In the past, there had been several attempts to find peace, however, each one failing and causing the Fox to return to war. As a result, during this period, enslaved Fox (men, women and children) entered Canada through raids and became a dominant source of enslaved labour in the Saint Lawrence Valley. Second Fox War For the Fox, the start and the potential end to their conflict lay in the slave trade. The Fox were still willing to return to the French alliance if they could secure the return of their captives. In fact, all they wanted was to be considered as allies and kin, not enemies. However, the French officials supported the Illinois, Ottawa, Ojibwa, and Huron, who were against the Fox. As a result, the peace treaty from 1726 was annulled in the summer of 1727. With this peace treaty being annulled, the Fox declared war to the French and all their Indian allies. For the next four years, the French invested a lot of money and, with their allies, descended on Fox villages with an extreme advantage. The French pursued destruction of the Fox to such an extent as to damage their relations with other tribes. The Sioux and the Iowa refused to grant the Fox sanctuary. By the summer of 1730, the Fox population was weakening and continued to be attacked until the Sauk finally granted them sanctuary. The Sauk and Fox fought off the French with the help of western Indians, who were aware of Beauharnois' plan for decimation. This final push would cause Beauharnois to grant a \\"General Pardon\\" in 1738 and for peace to be restored. Their historical feuds with New France encouraged many Sauk and Fox warriors to develop kinship ties with France's rivals, the British. These ties continued to be significant as late as the War of 1812, when many Sauk and Fox fought on the side of British North America. French finances The financial situation of the colony before the first Fox War was a state of semi-bankruptcy. The War of Spanish Succession had taken a significant toll on the funds of France, and by extension, on the resources available to the colony of New France. Therefore, the colony had to maximize its profits and try to minimize its spending. This posed a particular problem in respect to the long-standing tensions with the Fox natives and their long-standing enemies, the Cree and Assiniboines natives. The financial justification for wanting to prevent war was very simple for the French. Periods of war slowed down the production of fur by the natives and New France was in no position to lose any more money that had already been spent elsewhere. This lack of funds made the French dependent on their allies for furs. Large scale expeditions could not be carried out by French voyageurs, instead the voyageurs would travel into native hunting grounds to make their trades and maintain relationships. These relationships were vital to French economic success, but this also bound them to act as diplomatic partners, becoming embroiled in conflicts between Native groups as part of their trade agreements.  Slavery and the Fox Wars The Fox Wars facilitated the entry of Fox slaves into colonial New France in two ways: as spoils of French military officers or through direct trading. Beginning with the 1716 treaty, slavery became an ongoing element of the Fox-French relationship. As historian Brett Rushforth explains, Fox slavery in New France thus had a precarious symbolic power. On the one hand, the exchange of slaves signaled the possible end of conflict, while, on the other hand, it also served as a motive for inciting more conflict. In an early French manuscript describing the history of Green Bay, it is suggested that to gain peace with the Fox, it is more beneficial for opposing groups to simply return Fox captives than to take up arms against the Fox. \\"If this amnesty for slaves is not reached, and if the Fox do not maintain their promises for peace and \\"take up the hatchet anew, it will be necessary to reduce them by armed forces of both colonies acting in concert.\\" Slaves were so commonly held that \\"every recorded complaint made by the Fox against the French and their native allies centered on the return of Fox captives, the most significant issue perpetuating the Fox Wars into subsequent decades.\\" Yet, long after the conflicts Fox slaves worked in domestic service, unskilled labour and fieldwork, among other tasks throughout New France. Despite the abolishment of slavery in New France in accordance with the 1709 ordinance, Fox slavery was widespread. This pattern of slavery is evidence that intercultural experience in New France was sometimes vicious. Tensions and Economic Allies After the First Fox War, roughly 1000 Fox slaves were taken by the coalition of Native groups who were fighting the Fox (namely the Illinois). In addition, some were taken and sold to the French in Detroit and in return, they received goods and credit. The impact of these slave holdings tied into the tensions surrounding the Second Fox War. This demonstrated a distinct lack of control by the French over the trade that they depended upon in the early years of New France. After the First Fox War, there were tensions between the Fox and the French in Detroit, for holding slaves. Always wanting to secure French trade agreements, the Governor General of Canada, General Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, agreed to return the Fox slaves in his possession. This agreement relied on certain conditions. The first request was that the Fox return their slaves to other Native groups. The second request was that new slaves be brought to the French in the following year. The French desire for slaves would lead the Fox into conducting more slave raids, and increasing tension between Native groups. The Illinois would persist during this period in denying their holding of any Fox slaves, but the French were impotent to force the Illinois to return the slaves in their possession. This in turn caused tensions to boil over and spark the Second Fox War. By the end of the Second Fox War, France had lost a trading partner, and a certain amount of economic influence. Another aspect that was made apparent through these tensions was the lack of control over the trade that New France had found itself to be reliant on. This lack of control stemmed from the political nature of the slave trade and the adeptness at which Illinois natives had used it to anger the Fox and lock the French into alliances. As a result, this was another event that led to the decline of the French power in Great Lakes Region.

It was intended to be a reflective-parody of his previous films, and meant to be his final film for the next 30 years until 2002‚Äôs Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat. While the film's violence received much criticism, the film is currently seen as Herschell's most praised film.  Plot  Nancy Weston (Amy Farrell), a reporter for The Globe, approaches Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress), an obnoxious private investigator, and offers him $25,000 on behalf of The Globe to investigate the brutal murder of stripper Suzie Cream Puff (Jackie Kroeger). She sweetens the deal with a $25,000 bonus for solving the case. Of course this comes contingent that The Globe gets the exclusive story. Gentry takes the case and begins the investigation of the murder with Weston in tow. When at the club, Gentry encounters a waitress, Marlene (Hedda Lubin), whose obnoxiousness rivals his. He gets through her to speak to another stripper and gets his first suspect, Joseph Carter. Soon, another stripper, Candy Cane, gets murdered and Gentry expands his suspect list to Grout (Ray Sager), an unstable veteran who takes pride in crushing the heads of corpses he found when on the battlefields of Vietnam. He relieves tension by drawing faces on squashes and tomatoes and then crushing them with his bare hands. Gentry also suspects the leader of a radical feminist group that riots in the strip club, carrying banners with catchy phrases like \\"Lewd is Crude\\", \\"Quit with Tit\\" and \\"Women Right On!\\". Pickles, another stripper, is murdered and has her buttocks mutilated with a meat tenderizer hammer before having it salt and peppered. A badge with \\"Women Right On!\\" is found at the scene. Meanwhile, Gentry buys Weston many drinks to keep her drunk and out of his way. During one of Weston's drunken episodes she admits she's attracted to Gentry. Gentry ignores this and concentrates on the case. His investigation takes him to the owner of the strip clubs in town, Mr. Marzdone Mobilie (Henny Youngman). Gentry then coerces Mobilie into holding an amateur stripper contest with a $1,000 prize, which also works as the beginning of a plan for Gentry's trap. After having a few too many drinks, Gentry encourages Weston to perform the amateur stripper contest in which she goes all out by \\"taking it all off\\" and wins the $1,000 cash prize. Gentry accompany's Weston back to her apartment and lets her rest on her couch as he seemingly leaves. Soon, the killer arrives and Gentry, who anticipated that the killer would do just that, appears after hiding behind a door and takes off the killer's hood revealing Marlene. He also further reveals more when he pulls off her shirt revealing burn marks on her chest, literally obscuring her breasts. After a brief struggle, Marlene falls out a balcony window and lands on the street below where her head is crushed by an oncoming car. Gentry then reveals his case in a long monologue to Nancy Weston about following the clues which Gout told him earlier about Marlene being burned in a fire which her breasts were burned off. This drew the conclusion that she was killing all those strippers out of jealousy and hatred to their own beauty which Marlene's was now taken from her. Weston is somewhat angry that Gentry used her as bait to trap Marlene into revealing herself as the killer, but accepts for the risk was worth it. Gentry and Weston profess their love for each other as she tells him that the story will make a great contribution to The Globe and both of them get \\"down to business\\" (making out), before Gentry looks at the camera and tells the viewers that it's over and to leave them alone.

The film was first released on DVD by Something Weird Video in 2000, digitally mastered and featuring audio commentary by Herschell Gordon Lewis. The film was refused classification in Australia by the Office of Film and Literature Classification upon its review in 2005 and remains banned in the country.  Critical reception  The reception of the film was polarized, but more positive than Herschell's previous films. The violence & gore was seen by some as excessive and acting was criticized as well. However, the film's themes on sex-positivity, Vietnam War trauma, & modesty were seen to have merit. Allmovie wrote, \\"Herschell Gordon Lewis' final feature is so crudely lensed and unrelentingly violent that it's tempting to believe the whole thing was made solely as a prank\\", calling it \\"a fascinatingly sick swan song\\". Sean Leonard from HorrorNews.net gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"The Gore Gore Girls features decent-at-best acting, some uncomfortable edits, and a plot that repeats itself over and over until it seems an ending might be necessary. At the same time, it features hilarious gory scenes right from the start, with ridiculousness and schlock around every corner.\\" G.

BORDA began its work in 1977, starting with its first project, ‚ÄúTechnology Transfer of Biogas India- Ethiopia.‚Äù Since then it has been active in the delivery of basic needs services across the developing world. BORDA has been promoting and implementing DEWATS systems (decentralized wastewater treatment systems) in many countries in Asia (e.g. India) and Africa (e.g. Tanzania). BORDA is a partner organization of the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance. Regional Offices BORDA's main areas of operation are South Asia, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal ; Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam; Africa, comprising Mali and the SADC region states of Lesotho, Zambia, South Africa, and Tanzania; West & Central Asia, including Afghanistan and Iraq; and Latin America and The Caribbean, including Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti, Mexico, and Nicaragua. =Africa= In September 2006, BORDA started the SADC BNS program through co-operation with TED (Technology for Economic Development), a Lesotho-based NGO. In February 2010, a regional office was established in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The regional office coordinates the program activities, facilitates a constantly growing BNS network within the SADC region and links up with BNS networks in South and South-East Asia. Further more BORDA co-operates with the Water and Sanitation Association of Zambia (WASAZA), based in Lusaka. The BORDA BNS network develops and delivers the following service packages: Decentralized wastewater and urban sludge management, Community-Based Sanitation (CBS) with integrated wastewater treatment for community and public sanitation center and simplified sewer systems, School-Based Sanitation (SBS), Decentralized solid waste management (DESWAM), Biogas technologies, City Wide Sanitation Planning, Health & hygiene education (HE) and health impact assessment (HIA) and Quality management. All service packages are adapted to the conditions and requirements of the individual country and are supported by an adequate quality management system (QMS). In February 2009 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between BORDA and the Department of Water and Sanitation of the eThekwini Municipality (EWS) in the province KwaZulu Natal, South Africa for a demonstration and research DEWATS plant to be designed, constructed, commissioned and operated at Newlands-Mashu, Durban. In October 2010 the biogas settler and the anaerobic baffled reactors (ABR) were seeded with biomass. In June 2010 EWS, HERING South Africa, the Pollution Research Group (PRG) of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) and BORDA agreed to co- operate to achieve transfer of technology and know-how transfer for planning, installation and operation of prefabricated community ablution blocks (CABs) to offer improved sanitation services to communities. Based on this Public- Private-Partnership-Project BORDA SADC established a new office in Shakas Head, in the north of Durban. The premises are shared with HERING South Africa. =South Asia= BORDA has worked in India since 1979, making it the oldest region to be served by the organization. Programs implemented span the range of BORDA services, from Decentralized Wastewater Treatment (DEWATS) to Decentralized Energy Supplies. Currently, BORDA - South Asia (BORDA-SA) works in nine Indian states, as well as neighboring regions. In Nepal BORDA co- operates with ENPHO. BORDA-SA and its partners have been contracted by international development organizations, including GIZ (Germany, in particular with the formerly GTZ and InWent), AusAid (Australia), and CEU, as well as national and local governments. BORDA-SA supports a development cooperation network of 13 partner organizations, and by extension over 100 development experts in providing basic needs services. Over 110 DEWATS projects have been implemented, together with more than 65 Decentralized Energy Supplies and 60 Water Supplies. =Southeast Asia= The main emphasis of BORDA SEA is DEWATS, in particular DEWATS CBS, SME's and the establishment of community-based organisations to provide sustainable operation and maintenance of the facilities. For upscaling the DESWAM (decentralized solid waste management for low income urban communities) service package BORDA SEA develops in co- operation with IDRC (International Research Development Centre) a pro poor carbon financing scheme under the Kyoto protocol. In Indonesia, BORDA strongly emphasis on the enhancement of DESWAM as well as continuing the national program of community-based sanitation (SANIMAS) through the dissemination of DEWATS. Best practices are transferred into technical and social implementation standard as well as improving the involved human resources capacity through trainings and certification. The working group on Indonesian's national policy on water supply and sanitation is co-operating with BORDA and its local NGO partners as the main supporting network for community-based sanitation (CBS) with more than 500 implementations - including school-based sanitation and 14 DESWAM until the end of 2010. Local NGO partners are Balifokus, LPTP (Lembaga Pengembangan Teknologi Pedesaan - Center for Community-Based Environmental Technology) and B.E.S.T. In the Philippines, BORDA is co-operating with BNS Philippines to introduce DEWATS as a viable option for waste water and environmental health problems in urban areas. Transferring know-how was conducted by Indonesian experts within the context of the BORDA south-south dissemination program. By now, BNS is a well known service provider for DEWATS in the Philippines. In Cambodia, specialists on DEWATS from Indonesia have been facilitated by BORDA and its partner organization ESC (Environmental Services Cambodia) to support in enhancing its capacity concerning DEWATS know-how. 3 DEWATS plants were inaugurated in 2010. Cooperations with national and international stakeholders will allow a start up of DEWATS as an application for waste water management in Cambodia mainly for communities, schools and hospitals. In Vietnam, the BORDA maintains a branch office. Indonesian specialists support the capacity building at the Vietnam Partners at Vietnam Institute for Water Resources concerning DEWATS applications. In earlier years the Organization implemented the Hydraulic Ram (HydRam) technology as well as the use of biogas, energy-saving stoves, and solar panels, supported the introduction of HPC's turbine pumps and Decentralized Waste Water Treatment System (DEWATS) technology. In Laos, BORDA opened a project office in February, 2013, to implement DEWATS Service Packages in one of Southeast Asia's least developed countries. Institutional cooperation takes place at national and local level, particularly with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, Department of Housing and Urban Planning, to promote both improved public health within low income urban and peri-urban settlements, and the reduction organic pollution of precious fresh water sources for the benefit of the Lao people and nation. = West & Central Asia = Under the project title ‚ÄúCapacity building for local craftsmen and small medium enterprises for the sustainable implementation of Decentraliesed wastewater treatment systems (DEWATS)\\", BORDA runs project offices in Kabul and Herat since July 2012 with projects focused on vocational training. Many years of civil war and military intervention have brought about a massive destruction of infrastructure and the loss of capacities for civil reconstruction in Afghanistan. The current growth of the country‚Äòs urban centres intensifies the need for feasible waste disposal solutions and increases the demand for trained staff in the water, sanitation and hygiene sector. BORDA Afghanistan promotes DEWATS through training programs and learning projects. An emphasis is given to glass-fibre reinforced plastic (GRFP) technologies, which reduce the risk and cost of implementation. BORDA provides also School-Based Sanitation (SBS), Health & Hygiene Education (HE) and Health Impact Assessments (HIA) in Afghanistan. So far, such services have been deployed for Schools, Hospitals and Mosques in the provinces Kabul, Bamyian, Balkh, Badakshan, Herat, and Nangahar. The objective of current projects is also the dissemination of Biogas technologies in cooperation with local partner organisations. In order to achieve sustainable coherent development, BORDA Afghanistan coordinates closely with national institutions such as the Ministry of Urban Development Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency. For the vocational training of Afghan craftsmen and small- scale entrepreneurs BORDA cooperates with its local partners.

The strip began publication on 30 May 1959, premiering in the Saturday issue of Perth's Weekend Mail. It was subsequently published by other Australian Sunday newspapers, Sydney's The Sun-Herald (14 June 1959), Brisbane's The Sunday Mail and Adelaide's Sunday Mail. In May 1963, 'Air Hawk' also became a daily strip and unlike most US adventure strips, the Sunday and daily continuity on 'Air Hawk' were separate stories with Dixon writing them both. By 1967 the strip was appearing not only in every Australian state, but also in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa, France, and both North and South America. Dixon continued the strip until 1986. Dixon was assisted over the years by Mike Tabrett, Hart Amos (March 1970 ‚Äì June 1977), and Keith Chatto (1977-onwards). Chatto had previously ghosted the daily strip for a short period in 1972 before he took over drawing the Sunday version of the strip in the middle of 1977. In 1962 a series of Air Hawk and the Flying Doctors comics were published by Howitz Publications, the series however only ran for three issues. This was followed by another series of comics by Page Publications, reprinting episodes of the strip, with covers by Chatto. The Page series debuted in 1966, also only running for three issues, began with issue #20, but the title was altered to The Hawk and the Flying Doctors on the third issue. Although Dixon ceased the strip in 1986, the strip continued to be reprinted in the Sydney Morning Herald until the early 1990s. The strip is set in the Australian outback, and follows the adventures of Jim Hawk, a former Royal Australian Air Force pilot flying and intelligent agent, who operates the Air Hawk Charter service from Alice Springs. The charter service worked in conjunction with the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS). Dr Hal Mathews was a close friend of Jim Hawk who worked for the RFDS and Sister Janet Grant belonged to the Australian Inland Mission, whose medical clinic adjoined the air strip. In the mid-seventies, Jim Hawk was granted a franchise to supply a special Emergency Relief Unit. The Unit's function is to relieve any Flying Doctor base in need of assistance and to be available for special emergencies. Hal Mathews had been seconded to work with the Unit and Janet Grant was now his full-time assistant, with the change in responsibilities, the 'Doctors' part of the title was reverted to the singular. Routine charter operations were continuously disrupted by Jim Hawk's involvement in conflict with local and international villains. Reprints In the 1980s Queensland comic enthusiast, Nat Karmichael, published John Dixon's Air Hawk Magazine. While the first few issues had small print runs of just 500 copies, later issues were being sold through newsagents. One issue was co-published with Cyclone! Comics, who released it as one of their 'Summer Specials'. Selected storylines were reprinted in the book, John Dixon, Air Hawk and the Flying Doctor Volume 1, published by Comicoz in 2011. A second volume John Dixon's Air Hawk and the Flying Doctor: A Second Volume, was published by Comicoz in late 2013.

The store specializes in both new and used video games and music. It was founded in 1993 in Columbia, Missouri by Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias, originally as a music store. The store is known for selling local independent music, its collection of classic games, and for giving little credit for trade-ins. In 2007, the store raised some controversy for stockpiling Nintendo Wiis. As of 2009, there are 10 locations in Missouri and Illinois. Jellinek has said that the name \\"Slackers\\" comes from being a slacker in college‚Äîplaying video games and listening to music during their free time. A new store would be opened every few years, in various separate locations, so as not to lose business by placing two stores close together. Jellinek and Zacharias manage the chain of stores with a hands-on approach. History Slackers CDs and Games in Columbia, Missouri The original idea behind Slackers first occurred in 1990. Along with some friends, Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias went to a Don Henley concert, and began thinking about owning their own music store. At the time, the two were undergraduate students, and decided to focus their studies on business management and becoming entrepreneurs. Slackers CDs and Games was officially founded in 1993, by Jellinek and Zacharias, in Columbia, Missouri. Jellinek and Zacharias opened the store after graduating from Saint Louis University, using only their own collection of 1,500 music CDs. The name originated from their generation being considered slackers before being given a chance to prove otherwise. Although business was slow at first, with the store sometimes only making US$30 in a day, business eventually increased. After 2 years they were able to open a second location in O'Fallon, Illinois. As of 2009, there are 10 locations in the states of Missouri and Illinois, eight of which are in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, and two of which are in Mid-Missouri. Praise and criticism Slackers CDs and Games won an award for best used CD store in 2006 from the Riverfront Times. The Riverfront Times cited its collection of vinyl records and independent and rare music CDs as the basis for the award. Since the store buys video games from all consoles, it is known for its collection of classic titles. However, they do not require the box or manual for cartridge based games. The store is also known for giving more credit for trade-ins than its competitors. In 2005, Vox Magazine had the same four games (Halo, Metal Gear Solid 3, NHL 2004, and Madden NFL 2005) priced at EB Games, Game Crazy, and Slackers CDs and Games, with the trade-in values being $16.50, $26.82, and $45 respectively. =Wii Controversy= On December 20, 2007, the store raised some controversy when Ars Technica reported that the chain was stockpiling Nintendo Wii systems to sell at a higher profit while telling retail customers that the chain did not have any systems in stock, and were not expecting any. On December 21, 2007, Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website by stating that the article was sensationalist and misleading. Jellinek (bald) said that, of the 44 units the chain had, five were sold on eBay for $399.99, with a couple of units still in stock, and 35 were held for specific customers and sold at the MSRP. The remainder were given away. Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo's enforcement of the Wii's $249 retail price, and may prevent the store from receiving future products from Nintendo. Nintendo has refused to comment on the issue.

Introduced in Rival Schools: United By Fate =Batsu Ichimonji= is the main protagonist in both Rival Schools games. In Rival Schools: United by Fate, he is introduced as recently transferred student to Taiyo High searching for his mother. Joined by Hinata and Kyosuke, Batsu finds the person responsible for it is his long-lost father, Raizo. His individual ending in the game reveals he saves his mother and makes peace with his father. In the sequel, Project Justice, Batsu is again the main character, but is dogged by accusations that he is responsible for a new wave of attacks on local schools. The Taiyo High story in the game illustrates two different fates for him; either he fights off the allegation with the help of students from Pacific High School, or disappears for a period of time before returning with increased fighting power. The powered-up Batsu is playable in the game as Burning Batsu. Batsu was one of two Rival Schools characters (along with Akira) planned to appear in the canceled game Capcom Fighting All-Stars. He is a playable character in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, as well as Street Fighter Online: Mouse Generation, and a solo unit in Project X Zone. Batsu makes a cameo appearance with Hinata in Capcom vs. SNK 2: Millionaire Fighting 2001, assisting Kyosuke during one of his super combos, and in Iron Fist's ending for Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 as a member of the new Heroes for Hire line-up. He is voiced by Nobuyuki Hiyama. =Hinata Wakaba= first appears in Rival Schools, being the first student to tag along in Batsu's search for his missing mother. During the story, she admits to doing so to help protect her school. In her ending in the game, she finds out her involvement in the searches inspires other students at the school to take up karate, much to her surprise. In Project Justice, Hinata again joins Batsu and Kyosuke in investigating the new threat to the schools. Her fate in the Taiyo High story varies; in one story she is kidnapped by Kurow and eventually saved by Pacific High School students, or leads Taiyo's investigation in Batsu's absence and is later saved by him when attacked by Kurow. She makes a cameo with Batsu in Capcom vs. SNK 2: Millionaire Fighting 2001, assisting Kyosuke during one of his super combos, and in Batsu's Ending in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes along with Kyosuke. She is voiced by Tomoe Hanba. =Kyosuke Kagami= first debuts in Rival Schools, as a student at Taiyo High who volunteers to help Batsu find his mother. It is later revealed that Kyosuke is behind the kidnapping and was working for his twin brother, Hyo. Ultimately, Kyosuke changes allegiances, and helps Batsu and Hinata in defeating Hyo, while convincing Hyo that force was not the way to achieve their dreams. In Project Justice, Kyosuke becomes concerned when he meets Kurow Kirishima and sense the power helping him. When Hyo is later possessed by the spirit of the brothers' father, Kyosuke reluctantly fights his brother again. After the apparent death of Hyo, Kyosuke disappears, with his friends at Taiyo High waiting for him to return to school.

He also makes a cameo in Batsu's ending in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes along with Hinata. He is voiced by Isshin Chiba. =Hayato Nekketsu= is a physical education teacher at Taiyo High. He first appears in the PlayStation version of Rival Schools: United By Fate, as a bonus character. In that game, his plot is to find the source of the school abductions, as he believes the students are unable to do so themselves. In Project Justice, he joins fellow teachers Hideo and Kyoko in investigating the new set of kidnappings a year later. He likes red jerseys, fighting spirit and attractive women (this includes fellow teacher Kyoko, which causes a heated rivalry with Hideo); he dislikes bad manners, laziness, and things that his mother and father never found to be important, and he seems to love corporal punishment as his main weapon is a kendo sword that he hits opponents with.Fight-A-Base : Characters : Hayato Nekketsu (Rival Schools) He has black hair with thick eyebrows, and is dressed in a red track suit with a white shirt and sneakers. His last name, Nekketsu, literally means \\"hot-blooded\\" in Japanese - a perfect description of his personality. Hayato was designed by Kazuhiko Shimamoto. He is voiced by Takumi Yamazaki. =Chairperson= Chairperson, known as in Japan, first appears in Hinata's ending in Rival Schools, notifying her that their classmates had been inspired by Hinata to take up martial arts. In the ending, Chairperson is referred to as Class Leader. The School Life modes in Rival Schools and Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki 2 expand on her character a bit more. Her real name is undisclosed in the games, as she prefers to go by the \\"name\\" she uses in the student government of her school. She has long raven hair with a red hairband, and her primary outfit is a Taiyo High physical education uniform, complete with bright red sports jacket, black underwear/bloomers and white sneakers. She makes her first playable appearance in Project Justice, working together with Ran and the students of Pacific High School to find out the cause of the recent school violence and abductions. She is voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi. =Shoma Sawamura= is a student and baseball player from Gorin High, first appearing in Rival Schools. In that game, he searches for persons responsible for injuring his older brother and fellow baseball player, Shuichi, and joins Natsu and Roberto when he finds they are doing similar investigations. Though his fate varies on the characters selected in the game, Nagare's ending in Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki 2 reveals that Shoma is captured and brainwashed by Justice High School before being freed by Nagare. In Project Justice, Shoma ends up befriending Momo after she is the apparent victim of an attack by Batsu. However, Momo's insistence that he help her separates him from his friends Natsu and Roberto. After helping her in a number of scuffles, Shoma is betrayed by Momo and finds out she used him to help cause confusion among the various schools. He eventually reunites and reconciles with his friends. He is voiced by Y≈´ji Ueda. =Natsu Ayuhara= is a student and volleyball player from Gorin High, first appearing in Rival Schools. Her motivation in the game is to find the persons responsible for the attacks on Gorin, which included members of the school volleyball club. She joins Shoma and Roberto in similar investigations, although she frequently argues with Shoma over how to go about it. In Project Justice, Natsu is shown as suspicious of new student Momo, and disagrees with Shoma when he believes that they should help Momo out. After Shoma leaves to invesitage on his own with Momo, Natsu joins Roberto and Nagare in looking for the culprits of the new school disturbance. Later, she is the first to welcome back Shoma after he is betrayed by Momo. She is voiced by Narumi Tsunoda. =Roberto Miura= is a student and soccer player from Gorin High, first appearing in Rival Schools. Although he's one-quarter Brazilian, Roberto's a Japanese national. He joins Shoma and Natsu in their investigations on the attacks on their school, although he serves mostly as a moderator for the disagreements between Shoma and Natsu. His ending shows he breaks his arm during their investigation, which worries him as he cannot play his favored position of goalkeeper, but a scout offers a chance to play as a forward instead. In Project Justice, Roberto ends up between another fight between Shoma and Natsu, this time on whether to investigate who attacked Momo. After Shoma leaves with Momo, Roberto joins Natsu and Nagare in investigating the new disturbances going on at the schools. The Gorin High ending has him, along with Nagare, commenting on the newly forming love triangle between Shoma, Natsu and Momo. He is voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa. =Akira Kazama= is a character introduced in Rival Schools: United by Fate. Her initial appearance in the game is under a motorcycle helmet and a biker gear, posing as a boy in order to find out what happened to her older brother, Daigo. She befriends two of his subordinates, Edge and Gan and they eventually rescue Daigo, where Akira's true identity is revealed to the characters and player. An alternate version of Akira without the helmet and suit is playable in Rival Schools, but maintains the same ending as masked Akira. In Project Justice, Akira is revealed to have been transferred to the girls-only Seijyun High. In the Seijyun storyline, Akira is the central character, with the player following her quest to find out what happened to her brother. Unlike in Rival Schools, Akira starts off without her motorcycle helmet disguise, but can unlock it after playing through a certain storyline in the game. Akira, along with Batsu, was slated to appear in the canceled Capcom Fighting All-Stars. She is currently set to appear as a playable character via downloadable content in Street Fighter V.https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/5/21355744/street-fighter-5-new-fighters- season-5-dlc-dan-rose-oro-akira She is voiced by Chiharu Tezuka. =Edge= , real name , is a student from Gedo High School and member of the school's gang, introduced in Rival Schools: United By Fate. His most distinguishing features are his blonde hair, usually styled into tall spikes, his purple clothes, and his use of knives when fighting. In Rival Schools, Edge is one of the Gedo students who joins a disguised Akira in finding the whereabouts of Gedo's gang leader, Daigo. Though Edge is initially suspecting of Akira, and even engages, with Gan's assistance, a fight with her, he eventually comes to accept her, especially after she reveals her true gender. His ending has him initially choosing to stop picking fights with other children, but changes his mind at the urging of several of his classmates. In Project Justice, Edge becomes suspicious when a returning Daigo has him and Gan performing various, irrational attacks against other schools. Through the help of Akira and her friends at Seijyun High, the Gedo students break Daigo out of his brainwashing. The Gedo High ending in the game reveals that Edge is named one of the leaders of the Gedo gang after Daigo leaves to train. He is voiced by Yoshiharu Yamada. =Gan Isurugi= is a student from Gedo High and member of the school's gang, introduced in Rival Schools: United By Fate. In Rival Schools, Gan is one of the Gedo gang member who joins Akira in investigating what happened to Daigo. Like Edge, he is initially distrustful of Akira, but eventually accepts her as part of the gang even after she reveals her true identity. His ending has him inspired by his experiences to begin studying hard in class, albeit without much success. In Project Justice, Gan's role is much similar to Edge's, with both being used to attack random schools and eventually help the gang leader break free of his brainwashing. The Gedo high ending reveals that Gan was the other gang member appointed to lead the gang in Daigo's absence. He is voiced by Takashi Nagasako. =Daigo Kazama= is a student of Gedo High and the leader of the school's gang. He first appears in the arcade version of Rival Schools: United By Fate in Akira's ending, and is first playable in the PlayStation port of the game. In Rival Schools, Daigo has no set story in single player mode, although it is explained he set out alone to find the person responsible for the school kidnappings. His ending in the game reveals that he was defeated and brainwashed by Hyo Imawano, and was later freed by Akira, Edge and Gan in Akira's ending. In Project Justice, Daigo is the central character in the Gedo High story. After returning from a trip that takes place between Rival Schools and Project Justice, Daigo begins ordering his gang to attack random schools, much to the reluctance of Edge and Gan. When Daigo orders an attack on Seijyun High, Edge and Gan work with Akira and her Seiyjun classmates to stop him. It is then revealed that Daigo was brainwashed by Kurow Kirishima in order to create discord between the schools. The Gedo High story has two ending in the game which portray different fates for Daigo - one ending has him break free of his brainwashing and take a leave of absence to reflect on himself, while the other has him succumb to injuries from fighting. The brainwashed Daigo is playable in Project Justice, as the character Wild Daigo. He is voiced by K≈çichi Yamadera in United By Fate and Akio ≈åtsuka in Project Justice. =Roy Bromwell= is a character first introduced in Rival Schools: United By Fate. A rich foreign exchange student from the United States, he is often portrayed in the games as main character Batsu's rival. He is also an American football player, with a number of his in-game special moves named after elements of the sport. In the first game, he is ordered to investigate the school kidnappings by his father, with Tiffany and Boman joining him. During their investigation, the American trio is defeated and brainwashed to the service of Justice High, but eventually is freed thanks to Batsu and his Taiyo High compatriots. This causes Roy eventually rethink his ideas about Japan and its people. His ending in the game has him return to the United States determined to change the way of thinking in his home country, and 30 years after the games take place, he is elected the President of the United States. In Project Justice, Roy, along with Tiffany, returns to Japan when the new school conflict breaks out. They show up in two of the storylines in the game; either helping Batsu and his friends in the Taiyo High story, or joining up with Boman in the Pacific High story. The Pacific High ending has him return to the United States with Tiffany, more determined to change the world. He is voiced by Ry≈çtar≈ç Okiayu. =Tiffany Lords= is a wealthy student from Pacific High, also from the United States. Her story in Rival Schools: United By Fate has her joining Roy in his investigation of the school kidnappings, due to her crush on him. Like her classmates, she is captured and brainwashed by Justice High, but is eventually freed by students from Taiyo High. Her ending has her return to the United States with Roy, and setting out to train as a bodyguard after Roy begins his studies in politics. In Project Justice, Tiffany joins Roy in returning to Japan to investigate the new crisis in the country. Like Roy, she also appears in either the Taiyo High story, where she saves Hinata from capture, or the Pacific High story. She also returns to the United States in the Pacific High ending, setting out to help Roy in achieving his goals. She is voiced by Miki Narahashi. Tiffany makes a cameo appearance in Deadpool's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, where she can be seen asking for his autograph after he kills Galactus. Tiffany makes another cameo appearance in the background of the Kanzuki Beach stage in Street Fighter V. =Boman Delgado= is a student from Pacific High from the United States. He is training to be a preacher, and many of his moves in the games introduce some Christian imagery, mostly crosses. In Rival Schools, Boman joins Roy and Tiffany in their investigation of the kidnappings, albeit reluctantly due to his non-violent nature. He too is captured and brainwashed by Justice High, and eventually freed by Taiyo High students. This act inspires Boman, as in his ending, he stays in Japan to better understand Japanese culture and bridge the difference between Japan and the US. In Project Justice, Boman is the central character of the Pacific High story, having set out to find the person responsible for disrupting an inter-school athletic competition. He is joined in the investigation by two Taiyo High students, Ran and Chairperson, and later his classmates Roy and Tiffany. The Pacific High ending has him again stay in Japan to help improve relations between the US and Japan. He is voiced by Takashi Nagasako. =Hideo Shimazu= first appears in Rival Schools, introduced as a Japanese language teacher who is sent along with Kyoko to recruit students to the school. The game's story has Hideo eventually brainwashed by the school's principal and forced to bring in students to the school, but is snapped out of the brainwashing by students from Taiyo High School. Hideo's story has him show some concern for Kyoko and his ending, he proposes to her. In Project Justice, he and Kyoko, along with fellow teacher Hayato Nekketsu, investigate who is responsible for the new attacks on the school and eventually discover that a student at Justice, Kurow, is responsible. In story mode, Hideo is playable in the Justice High School, with the ending showing him hospitalized from the investigation (although a specific explanation to why is never given). Outside the Rival Schools games, Hideo appears alongside Kyoko as playable characters in the cross-over strategy RPG Namco √ó Capcom. He was voiced by Tetsuo Mizutori. =Kyoko Minazuki= is a school nurse and later chemistry teacher at Justice High School. In Rival Schools, she is sent along with Hideo to recruit students to the school. Like Hideo, she too is captured and brainwashed to do the school's bidding until being freed by students from Taiyo High. In her ending in the game, the values she gains from the ordeal moves her to convict a former employer for corruption, and she eventually accepts Hideo's marriage proposal. In Project Justice, Kyoko appears with Hideo and Hayato in the Justice High storyline, investigating the cause of the new school attacks. In the story's ending, she is shown taking care of Hideo and reminding him of their wedding. Kyoko also appears as a playable character in Namco √ó Capcom alongside Hideo. She is voiced by Kotono Mitsuishi. =Raizo Imawano= first appears in Rival Schools: United by Fate and is initially portrayed as the main antagonist in the game. The principal of Justice High, most of the games cutscenes show him as the organizer of the events that take place in the game and reveal that he is the father of Batsu. However, the \\"true\\" ending to the game reveal Raizo was working under the orders of Hyo, his nephew who brainwashed him as well as most of the student body. Raizo is a hidden character in the game and his ending shows him atoning for his actions and returns to his family. In Project Justice, Raizo is not playable, but makes a few appearances in the game's Story Mode. An attack on him by Kurow is the catalyst for the events of the game's story, and he also makes an appearance in the Taiyo High story mode. He is voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura. =Hyo Imawano= first appears in Rival Schools: United by Fate as the final boss of the game. Revealed through the player meeting certain requirements during a fight with Raizo, Hyo is shown as the mastermind behind the events of the game's story, with his goal to take over Japan. Hyo is ultimately defeated by students from Taiyo High School, which include his twin brother Kyosuke. Hyo is also playable in the game, with his ending showing him successful in his plans but regretting having to defeat Kyosuke in doing so. However, this ending is not canonical. In Project Justice, Hyo appears as the final boss of the game, but is not the main antagonist. In most of the game's Story Mode, he initially appears to defeat Kurow Kirishima, who had been shown brainwashing Hyo earlier in the storyline. Afterwards, he is shown being taken over by his father's spirit, where he becomes Demon Hyo, the final boss of the game. Again he is defeated by Kyosuke, but dies from the fight. He was voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa, who had died, which is why they killed Hyo off. =Sakura Kasugano= Originally a character from Street Fighter Alpha 2, makes a guest appearance in Rival Schools: United By Fate.

She is the editor in chief of the school's newspaper. She investigates the kidnappings and disappearances, seeking to scoop an exclusive news story. In Project Justice, she works with Chairperson and students from Pacific High School to find the ones responsible for creating havoc between the schools. Her name is a play on Dan Hibiki from Street Fighter, it has been speculated they are related but there is no confirmation, despite Dan mentioning he has a sister in the NeoGeo Pocket Color title, SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium. She is voiced by Akiko Hiramatsu. =Nagare Namikawa= is a student and swimmer from Gorin High. His story explains he is a childhood friend of Shoma, and sets out to find him after he disappears from the school.

It is later revealed that she is actually working for Kurow Kirishima, and that her actions were to distract Shoma and his friends. She is betrayed by Kurow at the end of the Gorin story, however. The Gorin ending also reveals she develops a legitimate crush on Shoma, much to the chagrin of Natsu. She is voiced by Rei Sakuma. =Yurika Kirishima= is one of two Seijyun High characters introduced in Project Justice, where she is introduced to the player as a high-class girl who fights with her violin. In the game's story mode, she was friends with Akira and befriends Zaki, but is also shown in several other storylines to be doing so at the orders of her brother, Kurow. She is later shown admitting to helping her brother's plans and betrays him to join her friends. The Seijyun High ending shows her having disappeared from school out of guilt for her actions, but she later returns (much to the pleasure of Akira). She is voiced by Keiko Han. =Zaki= , real name , is a female gang leader introduced in Project Justice. Zaki is introduced at the beginning of the Seijyun High School storyline, being asked by Akira and Yurika to help investigate the strange behavior of Akira's brother, Daigo. She is shown to be highly confrontational, showing anger at an attack by Batsu Ichimonji and snapping at the teacher trio of Hideo, Kyoko and Hayato when the girls are questioned about the confrontation, but is also seen as forgiving when Yurika reveals herself to be working for Kurow Kirishima, the person who brainwashed Daigo, Zaki is at first reluctant to forgive her, but changes her mind when Akira forgives Yurika anyway. She is voiced by Ai Orikasa. =Kurow Kirishima= is the main antagonist of Project Justice, but this is not revealed until later on in the story. He makes various appearances throughout different stories early on in the game's story mode, either as himself or as , a fake of series hero Batsu Ichimonji. His actions include either attacking various groups of students with his lackeys - his sister Yurika, Momo, and a brainwashed Daigo - or having them do his dirty work for him. At a certain point, Kurow unveils himself as the mastermind behind the recent upheaval among the schools. He explains that he is sent by the ninja clan the Imawano family was a part of to assassinate Batsu, Raizo, Kyosuke, and Hyo. After being defeated by the group of students selected by the player, he attempts to send a brainwashed Hyo Imawano after the players, only to be betrayed and defeated by Hyo. The sequence following the final fight in story mode reveals Kurow is hospitalized after the attack, but escapes after a few days. A bonus storyline available in Project Justice, the Darkside Student Council, tells an alternate story in which Kurow's plans to take over the various schools succeeds. The ending for this story has him at the head of Justice High School, shown with the various characters of the series as his brainwashed servants, including his own sister. He is voiced by Bin Shimada.

She was also an accomplished poet and writer. Biography Born in Quebec City, of Scottish/English descent, Marion Elizabeth Moodie went west to Calgary, with her family, in 1891. Seven years later she graduated from the Calgary Hospital, the first fully trained nurse to receive her diploma in the province of Alberta. For five years she engaged in private nursing and hospital work in central and southern Alberta, and later in Manitoba. During the war Miss Moodie was nursing sister, and later matron, at Ogden Military Hospital, Calgary. A keen student and lover of nature, Miss Moodie found time, in her busy pioneer life, to make botanical collections of the flora of Alberta for the provincial government at Edmonton, as well as for such well-known American institutions as the Smithsonian, the New York Botanical Gardens, Harvard University, and the Field Museum, Chicago. Moodie was also a writer. An earlier book of poems appeared under the title \\"Songs of the West,\\" and a fairy-tale book, \\"The Legend of Dryas\\". Moodie was also a frequent contributor to Canadian periodicals of articles on pioneer nursing, children's stories and articles reflecting her interest in and love for the out-of-doors.  Some poems  From \\"Songs of the West\\": The Call of the Woods There's a murmuring in the trees, And a sighing on the breeze; There's a calling from the robins on the hill; And it fills my heart with pain And a longing that is vain To be up and out, a-wandering at my will. There are wildflowers everywhere Shedding fragrance on the air, The butterflies are hurrying to and fro; The squirrels and the bees Are as busy as you please, Out there among the hills where I would go. For it's there that one can rest, Lying close to Nature's breast, And the breeze's lullaby is low and sweet, So I turn my longing eyes Where the stately mountains rise, And the wooded hills are nestling at their feet. Solace Deep in the forest wandering, From life's noise and strain apart, Seeking the comfort of Nature To quiet a restless heart. There came in the shade and silence, The calm of a presence near, That stilled my pulse's throbbing, While my soul drew close to hear. How that Mother Spirit brooded Over all things, small and great, O'er each fragile fern and flower, And the pines in lofty state. Strengthened the tender seedlings, The tempest-torn and scarred, And clothed with strange new beauty The fallen trees, and marred. Then dark sorrow fled before her For instead of sting and smart, She gave to my troubled spirit New peace from her own great heart.

He was prominent in opposing the MƒÅori occupation of Moutoa Gardens in 1995. Biography Poynter was born in 1939. As a boy, he was \\"inquisitive, totally mischievous\\" and \\"always the leader and organiser\\". He was a bookseller‚Äîa business he inherited from his father and located in Victoria Avenue, the main shopping area of Wanganui. He was elected to the Wanganui City Council as a councillor in 1977, re-elected in 1980 and stood for the mayoralty in 1983 upon the retirement of Mayor Ron Russell. He polled as runner-up to Doug Turney and was made deputy mayor in 1983 as a consequence. In 1986, he challenged Turney and was successful, winning with a majority of 1529 votes. In 1989 he increased his majority, defeating challenger John Blaikie by almost 6,000 votes. This was the first election under the new local government boundaries with Wanganui City incorporating Wanganui County and some of Waitotara County. Blaikie was the chairman of the Wanganui County Council prior to the reorganisation. The new territorial authority was named 'Wanganui District Council'. In 1992, Poynter was challenged by Wanganui greengrocer Randhir Dahya, a popular Indian businessman. His majority was cut to just 939 votes (Wanganui Chronicle of 20 October 1992). Dahya challenged him twice more, in 1995 and 1998, but Poynter easily resisted these challenges, assisted by his handling of the Moutoa Gardens occupation of 1995 and the unfortunate death of his wife of 40 years, Joy, four months prior to the 1998 election. By 2001, the writing was on the wall and he regained the mayoralty with just 27% of the vote, warding off four councillor challengers. In 2004, he stood again and was defeated, polling third behind media personality Michael Laws and businessman John Martin with just 20% of the vote. Poynter was chairman of Wanganui Gas from its inception in 1992 until his retirement from the role on 14 December 2005. In the 1993 New Year Honours, Poynter was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. He died in 2007 from cancer. He was survived by two daughters and a son. Consultation was carried out in 2009 by Wanganui District Council to rename Wikitoria Road, connecting State Highway 3 and Wanganui Airport, to Chas Poynter Drive. Wikitoria was a daughter of Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui who was named after Queen Victoria, and the Putiki iwi strongly objected to it. The proposal did not go ahead.

Life Hindlip hall He was educated in York, in the Royal School of William and Mary in the Horse Fayre, which cost no money to attend. Guy Fawkes, Edward Oldcorne and brothers Christopher and John Wright were among Tesimond's classmates, all of whom would become involved in the Gunpowder Plot. In 1580, at the age of seventeen, he entered English College in Rome. After three years of philosophy, Tesimond, with permission from the Jesuits' cardinal protector, Giovanni Morone joined the Society of Jesus in April 1584.Morris, John. \\"Father Tesimond's Landing in England\\", The Troubles of Our Catholic Forefathers Related by Themselves, Vol. 1, Burns and Oates, 1872 Tesimond spent most of his adult life in Italy, under the name of Philip Beaumont, (Beamond, B√©mont). Later, Tesimond studied, among other things, theology in Messina, where he afterwards taught philosophy. He was ordained, some time before he left on the English Mission, in November 1587. He arrived at Gravesend on 9 March 1598. Tesimond worked for eight years as a missioner with Edward Oldcorne in Worcestershire and Warwickshire under the name \\"Father Greenway\\", primarily out of Hindlip Hall. He was professed as a Jesuit on 28 October 1603. He would later become somewhat involved in the Gunpowder Plot. He effectively documented his experiences in a narrative which he wrote sometime after.

It is a near-certainty that the actual plot was divulged to Tesimond by Robert Catesby, someone who was deeply involved. Catesby had asked for advice in general terms about the morality of collaterally causing the death of innocents. At the time, Tesimond assumed he was referring to fighting in the Dutch Wars, but afterwards became uneasy. Tesimond in turn revealed his disquiet to his Jesuit superior, Henry Garnet, in confession. Garnet judged that he had received this information under the seal of the confessional, and that canon law forbade him to repeat it,\\"The Gunpowder Plot\\", The Jesuits in Britain but urged Tesimond to dissuade Catesby.McCoog, S.J., Thomas M., The Society of Jesus in Ireland, Scotland, and England, 1598-1606, BRILL, 2017, , p. 508 Garnet later told Catesby that the Pope did not want English Catholics to cause disturbances as that would only bring harsher treatment, but Catesby was unmoved.Adams, Simon. \\"The Gunpowder Plot: Terror and Toleration\\", History Today, Vol. 55 Issue 11 November 2005 Tesimond and Garnet kept their knowledge secret, which constituted a violation of the law. Sir Edward Coke conducted the prosecution for the government ‚Äì an easy one, since the conspirators had no legal representation ‚Äì and through his speeches, presented the plot as a Jesuit conspiracy. Thomas Wintour, at his later execution, cleared all Jesuits (Tesimond specifically and most especially), from any involvement, counseling or advising regarding the plot.Healey, Robin. \\"Tesimond, Oswald\\" (#7359), Italian Literature before 1900 in English Translation, University of Toronto Press, 2011, Flight Tesimond's arrest warrant was sworn out on 15 January 1606, describing him in detail: \\"..of a reasonable stature, black hair, a brown beard cut close on the cheeks and left broad on the chin, somewhat long- visaged, lean in the face but of a good red complexion, his nose somewhat long and sharp at the end, his hands slender and long fingers, his body slender, his legs of a good proportion, his feet somewhat long and slender. (excerpt from the proclamation for Tesimond's arrest. Tesimond was able to escape arrest. He evaded the constables of London, then made his way to safe houses in Essex and Suffolk. He then proceeded to sail to Calais among a cargo of dead pigs by passing as the owner of the load. He then went to Boulogne, and then on to Saint-Omer. Later life Tesimond, after escaping arrest, spent some years in Saint-Omer. He wrote a narrative based on the happenings of the Gunpowder Plot. Written in Italian, Tesimond's narrative probably comprises one of the most detailed and complete accounts of the plot itself. It may have been based on another Latin account of an unknown and unnamed secular priest. The narrative was sent to Rome to better inform the Jesuit authorities. Later, from the year 1617, Tesimond was prefect of studies and consulter in Messina. He held this position there for many years, among time spent in Rome during the most of 1621, and among other minor occupations. After some time there, he moved to Naples, Italy, where he would die in 1636. This was documented in a letter by Sir Edwin Rich to James I of England, which warned the king against accepting any gift he might receive, which might consist of poisoned clothing from Tesimond; in England, vigilance was still elevated after the events that transpired following the Gunpowder Plot.

Merrie Melodies cartoon short directed by Friz Freleng, and notable for its title song, composed by Sanford Green and with lyrics by Irving Kahal. The short was released on May 30, 1936. Plot The plot revolves around a group of fun-loving anthropomorphic insects which have taken over a kitchen. The female insects promptly become enthralled by a crooning show-off of a fly, Bingo Crosbyana, \\"the crooning hit of all Havana\\", a caricature of the singer Bing Crosby, who incurs the jealous resentment of their boyfriends. Bingo, however, literally shows his colors (yellow) when a spider invades the kitchen, leaving Bingo to cower in fear inside a roll of wax paper. After the boyfriends team up to trap the spider on a sheet of fly paper, Bingo emerges from the wax paper roll and attempts to resume his braggadocio, only to be put in his place decisively. Legal cases Bingo Crosbyana was one of two Warner Bros. cartoons (along with Let It Be Me) which Bing Crosby initiated lawsuits to suppress because they portrayed him in what Crosby considered a defamatory light. In this case, he objected to his portrayal as a vainglorious coward and to the imitation of his voice.Cohen (2004), p. 39-40 According to The Hollywood Reporter, Paramount Pictures was suing Warner Bros. alongside Crosby. Their law firm wanted the distribution of the film to cease. Apparently they lost their case.

It reinstated the 1932 constitution, which effectively eliminated the Senate, established a unicameral legislature composed equally of elected and government-appointed members, and allowed serving military officers to supplement their commands with important ministerial portfolios. Prelude to the coup Having defeated the navy in the Manhattan Rebellion, the army-led Coup Group turned its attentions toward the remaining civilians in government. Although the military was in control of the army, politicians and legislators continued to annoy the generals. Throughout 1950 and the following year, the civilians and military men bickered over spoils and offices, and, despite its monopoly on the use of force, the Coup Group lost some political battles. In January 1951 the civilian parties forced the prime minister, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram (Phibun), to replace two military ministers with civilians. Similarly the Senate remained a royalist stronghold. In one October session senators sharply attacked the government for its violent suppression of the Manhattan Rebellion. In November the upper house blocked a bill to increase the military voice in elections. The Coup Group quickly decided that rewriting or amending the constitution was the only way to get rid of these irritants. Because the 1949 constitution drafted by the palace-backed Democrats barred active government officials‚Äîincluding military and police officers‚Äîfrom the cabinet, the Coup Group found it objectionable. In August and October 1951 the powerful police chief, Phao Sriyanond, travelled to Switzerland to persuade the young King Bhumibol to accept a constitution more amenable to the military. On the first trip, the king apparently failed to object to the proposal, but Phao returned to Thailand empty-handed. In November the Coup Group decided to proceed without the king's approval. By then the generals' only obstacle was Phibun. Because his strength lay in the multiplicity of political groups and his ability to play one off the other, the field marshal resisted all efforts by the Coup Group to remove civilians from their positions in the administration. The coup In the end, the Coup Group chose to disregard Phibun as well as the king. On 26 November they sent a representative to the prime minister to suggest reverting the 1949 constitution to the less democratic and anti-royalist one of 1932. The proposal was immediately rejected by Phibun, but, three days later, nine leading members of the Coup Group‚Äîamong them Phao Siyanon, Field Marshals Phin Chunhawan, Sarit Thanarat, and Air Chief Marshal Fuen Ronnaphakat‚Äîpressed him in person. Phibun again angrily rebuffed them. By then the Coup Group was getting desperate. The king planned to return from Lausanne in two days to assume his royal duties and the generals could not risk a dangerous confrontation with the monarch. Therefore, that evening, while the king was en route from Singapore to Bangkok, they announced the dissolution of parliament, reinstatement of the 1932 constitution, and formation of a provisional government. Phibun initially refused to join the new government but, after much negotiating, accepted the fait accompli. The next morning he signed on again as prime minister. Aftermath As with the Manhattan Rebellion, it was Phao who gained the most from the coup. His visits to the king indicate that he probably led the coup, and, most likely because of this role, he was able to take advantage of the civilians' defeat more readily than the other Coup Group members. While Phao's rival, Sarit, entered the cabinet as deputy minister of defence unaccompanied by close supporters, the Phao-Phin clique captured five cabinet slots. Phao's own appointment as deputy minister of the interior gave him effective control over this politically powerful ministry that allowed him to ruthlessly eliminate parliamentary opposition.

Written by band members Deron Miller, Chad I Ginsburg and Jess Margera, and produced by Ginsburg, it is featured on the band's 2002 second studio album Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild. The song was released as a single in 2002, reaching number 38 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. Origins and recording As with the rest of the Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild album, writing for \\"Flesh Into Gear\\" was credited to vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller, guitarist Chad I Ginsburg and drummer Jess Margera. Prior to its release in 2002, the song was recorded as a demo under the title \\"Sinking Fast\\" and featured on the second CKY video, CKY2K, released in 2000. Composition and style Billboard magazine described the overall atmosphere of \\"Flesh Into Gear\\" as \\"anthemic\\". However, a review of Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild on Sputnikmusic labelled the song as \\"negative\\", noting an \\"upbeat-yet-stoneresque rhythm\\" at the beginning of the track. Spin magazine related the song to the band's link with skateboarding and stunt videos, describing it as \\"elbow-scraping rock\\". PopMatters writer Nikki Tranter proposed that the lyrics of the song saw singer Miller \\"relating his band‚Äôs vision for its future\\", citing lines such as \\"A simple sound/A heavy side/Could win the whole world over\\". Release and reception In addition to its original release on the album Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild in September 2002, \\"Flesh Into Gear\\" was also featured on the film Jackass: The Movie in October that year, and included on its soundtrack album. It was released as a single to promote both albums that year, and became the first single release by the band to chart when it reached number 38 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. In 2015, it was included on the compilation album The Best of CKY. The track has generally been praised by music critics and fans since its original release. Billboard magazine claimed that it contained \\"enough unique elements to raise [the band] above the competition\\", while Tranter of PopMatters described it in the same category as \\"Escape from Hellview\\" and \\"Frenetic Amnesic\\" as a \\"neat heavy rock tune\\". Music website Loudwire ranked \\"Flesh Into Gear\\" as the 35th best hard rock song of the 21st century, with writer Graham Hartmann claiming that it \\"barely scratches the surface in regard to the band's accomplishments in both importance and creativity\\". Music video The music video for \\"Flesh Into Gear\\" was directed by Bam Margera, brother of drummer Jess, and released in the week of December 23, 2002. The video was later released, alongside videos for the other nine songs on the album, on the band's 2003 video album Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild: The Video Album. Writing a review of the album for the website The Movies Made Me Do It, Chad Connolly quoted director Margera as noting that the video was filmed on an \\"extremely low budget\\", and described it as a performance video interlaced with stunt clips featuring CKY Crew members Brandon DiCamillo, Rake Yohn and Margera.

He had been beaten, strangled and stabbed numerous times, partially decapitated, and his body doused in gasoline and set on fire.. The Baldwin County District Attorney, David Whetstone, stated that Weaver's sexual orientation was a factor in the crime. He remarked that the brutality involved \\"is suggestive of overkill, which is not something you see in a regular robbery and murder.\\" Alabama's hate crimes statute does not apply to people targeted because of their sexual orientation. Three people were charged with capital murder and robbery in connection with the crime, two of whom were Weaver's roommates: Christopher Gaines, aged 20, Nichole Kelsay, aged 18, and Robert Porter, aged 18. Nichole Kelsay had been Weaver's friend throughout most of his life. In May 2007, with Judge Langford Floyd presiding, Christopher Gaines pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison without parole; he is serving his sentence at Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore. Porter pleaded guilty to murder and first degree robbery in September 2007, and received two consecutive life sentences; he is serving his sentence at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer. Kelsay pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for conspiracy to commit murder. This crime was featured in Small Town Gay Bar, a 2006 documentary film depicting the difficulties of being gay in the rural South.

The short was released on May 2, 1936. Plot The plot revolves around an anthropomorphic hen named Emily (a prototype Miss Prissy), whose boyfriend rooster is just about to propose marriage to her when she gets infatuated with a passing rooster motorist, the radio crooner Mr. Bingo (a caricature of Bing Crosby). She goes with Mr. Bingo instead. Bingo, while dating Emily in a nightclub, gets infatuated with a singing French hen (a caricature of Irene Bordoni), and after Emily cries that Bingo no longer loves him, has a waiter throw her out into the street. Crying, she then fends for herself selling violets on a winter day. The jilted boyfriend meanwhile overhears Mr. Bingo on the radio. He grabs the radio and smashes it on the ground, with the \\"boo boo boo boo\\" sounding as if the radio is in its death throes. He eventually makes his way to the city, goes to the radio station and gives Bingo his just due in the middle of a broadcast. He then finds Emily selling violets, forgives her and marries her, and sires her brood. In the concluding scene, both were lounging in the living room when the scene is cut to one of her brood of chicks singing at the piano the song that Emily first heard when she dated Mr. Bingo. A book is hurled and hits the poor chick, silencing the singing. Legal cases This cartoon, along with Bingo Crosbyana were the two Warner Bros. cartoons which Bing Crosby initiated lawsuits to suppress because they portrayed him in what Crosby considered a defamatory light.

Its significance emerges in Lurianic Kabbalah, as a stage in the process of Tohu and Tikun. Akudim (◊¢÷≤◊ß◊ï÷º◊ì÷¥◊ô◊ù in Hebrew) is the first world to result from Adam Kadmon (\\"Primordial Man\\"). Sfirot (Heavenly Attributes, depicted as lights) emanating from the eyes, ears, nose, mouth and forehead of Adam Kadmon interact with each other to create three sequential \\"worlds\\" containing combinations of fundamental heavenly attributes: Akudim, Nekudim and Berudim. Luria read these three terms from the esoteric meaning of Jacob's breeding of Laban's flocks in Genesis 30:27-43. The world of Akudim corresponds to Hiyuli (◊î÷¥◊ô÷º◊ï÷º◊ú÷¥◊ô, meaning \\"Potential\\" Creation). These three stages then interact to produce more \\"worlds\\" of increasing developmental complexity. The concepts of primordial man and his body are figurative rather than literal.  The source of the world of Akudim  The world of Akudim is formed of the vapor that emanates from the \\"mouth\\" of Adam Kadmon.  \\"Lights\\" and \\"Vessels\\" in the world of Akudim  In this world, all the ten Sefirot lights are bound within one vessel, hence then name \\"Akudim\\" (meaning \\"binding\\"). The lights, unable to \\"settle\\" well into the one vessel, enter into a \\"dynamic\\" referred to as ◊û◊ò◊ô ◊ï◊ú◊ê ◊û◊ò◊ô mati v'lo mati, literally \\"reaching and not reaching.\\" The lights descend from the \\"mouth\\" of Adam Kadmon to enter the vessel of Akudim and then \\"about-face\\" to (partially) ascend back to their source in the \\"mouth\\" of Adam Kadmon, and so, back and forth forever.  Expressions of Akudim in human beings  In a human being this is represented by a situation in which all of one's attributes, be they emotional or intellectual, have only one way to express themselves. One can compare this to an infant who possesses the sole medium of \\"crying\\" (or a single word) that he can utilize to express his myriad attributes.

The star is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +4.34. This is an A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A7 V. The star is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 172 km/s. This is giving the star an oblate shape with an equatorial bulge that is 12% larger than the polar radius.

This may indicate that the star has an unseen companion. Œ¥ Doradus displays an infrared excess suggesting it may be a Vega-like star with an orbiting debris disk. Currently this star is the Moon's south pole star, which occurs once every 18.6 years. The pole star status changes periodically, because of the precession of the Moon's rotational axis.

The band split up in 2000 after releasing their Lego album, but reunited in 2005 and released their self-titled album in 2007. History Sadist was formed in 1991 when Tommy Talamanca(guitar, keyboards) and Peso (Necrodeath - drums) started auditioning for musicians to complete their lineup. A few weeks after the auditions, Andy (bass) and Fabio (vocals) joined. While playing locally with original content from their demo, they were signed by the indie label Obscure Plasma Records. Their demo was released as Black Screams EP in September 1991, and sold 2500 copies worldwide. The EP was later released in 1992 by American indie label Wild Rag Records in a three-track version. The band toured Italy and France until Fabio left the band, which forced Andy to play bass as well as sing. Shortly afterward, the band played a show in Lisbon and were well received by audience and local media. The band then obtained a record deal with Nosferatu Records for a two-album contract and released Above the Light in 1993. Andy left the band, replaced by bassist Chicco and a new singer, Zanna. In late 1993, the band recorded a video for the song \\"Sometimes They Come Back\\" from the Above the Light album and toured France and the Netherlands. In early 1994, Sadist supported Carcass during the Italian shows for their \\"Heartwork\\" tour; a few months later they supported Samael in France. While on tour, the band worked on songs for their new album and in May 1995 entered Rhythm Studios in Bidford on Avon, England, where they started recording their second album. In 1996, Tribe was released in February, distributed by Sun Rising Records for Europe and Toy's Factory for Japan. The band toured to promote the new album in France, Italy, and the Netherlands until June and their second video, \\"Tribe,\\" was broadcast all over Europe. In November, Sadist headlined Mindviews Belgian Metal Convention, and later were featured on the Japanese Iron Maiden tribute with their version of \\"Wrathchild.\\" At the end of 1996, drummer Peso left to work on an old side- project and was replaced by Oinos. Singer Zanna and bass player Chicco were replaced by singer Trevor and bass player Andy. In early 1997, the band started recording sessions for their next album, but before the album was released Oinos left the band, replaced by Alessio. At the end of 1997, Sadist signed with label Displeased Records and releases Crust that same year. The album was also distributed successfully in Japan. In 1998, the band released their third music video, \\"'Fools' and Dolts.\\" Shortly afterwards, the band travelled to Germany to play at European festival Wacken Open Air as the first Italian metal band to play there. In 1999, the band signed with Impact/System Shock and produced the new album Lego by themselves at Nadir Recording and Mastering. The response to the album was not as favorable as to previous albums, and the band decided to take a break for a while. They reunited in 2005 and signed with Italian indie label Beyond Productions. They re-released Above the Light and Tribe both remastered at Nadir Recording and Mastering. In late 2006, the band stareds recording sessions for a new album, with guest musicians like Claudio Simonetti and Dado Sezzi. The album was released in April 2007 and their fourth video for \\"Tearing Away\\" was made. The band toured the rest of the year, headlining two Armenian festivals, \\"Highland Metalfest\\" and \\"Rock the Borders.\\" Sadist are currently working on a new album.

Family history Thomas Lea was born at The Larches, near Kidderminster, in 1841, the eldest son of George Butcher Lea. He came from a family which had manufactured Kidderminster stuff and bombazine in the 17th and 18th centuries. His ancestor Francis Lea with son John Lea went over to carpet weaving in 1781. When Francis retired from this firm, he and his second son Thomas Lea set up a worsted spinning business in Callows Lane, Kidderminster. Francis' daughter married William Butcher, and their son George Butcher later joined the firm. In 1831 George formed the firm of Butcher, Worth and Holmes to manufacture carpets. In 1835 Thomas gave his spinning business to his nephew George Butcher, who later took the name George Butcher Lea.Melvyn Thompson, Woven In Kidderminster: an illustrated history of the carpet industry in the Kidderminster area ...

He then built Slingfield Mills at Kidderminster in 1864. He retired in favour of his sons (who formed a company) in 1892 (they later sold the company in 1920). Politics Lea was chosen as the Liberal candidate for Kidderminster in 1868, only 27 years old, and won by a large margin. He held the seat until 1874, and later represented County Donegal from 1880 to 1885 and County Londonderry South from 1886 to 1900. While in Ireland, Lea expressed hostility to the Irish language; he proposed an amendment to the draft of the second Home Rule Bill that would have prevented the passing of laws which would increase Irish language use in state schools, legal courts and other public spheres. Retrieved on 7 April 2018. He was a Justice of the Peace. In 1892, he was created a baronet, of The Larches in Kidderminster in the County of Worcester and of Sea Grove in Dawlish in the County of Devon. Family Lea married, in 1864, Louisa Birch, daughter of William Birch, of Barton-under-Needwood, Staffordshire. They had two sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Sir Thomas Sydney Lea (1867-1946) succeeded as baronet, and was a barrister. The younger son, Rev. Percy Lea, was a priest. Lea died at Kidderminster on 9 January 1902, aged 60.

Addams Homestead, also known as the Jane Addams Birthplace, is located in the Stephenson County village of Cedarville, Illinois, United States. The homestead property, a site, includes an 1840s era Federal style house, a Pennsylvania-style barn, and the remains of John H. Addams' mill complex. The house was built in two portions, in 1846 and 1854 by Addams; he added some minor additions during the 1870s. Other major alterations took place during a 1950s modernization of the home. The homestead has been noted for its significance to industry and politics. On September 6, 1860 future Nobel Peace Prize recipient Jane Addams was born in the house. History The John H. Addams Homestead includes the house, a Pennsylvania-style bank barn, and the remains of the Addams Grist Mill. After arriving in Stephenson County in 1845, Addams purchased the Cedar Creek Mills from Van Valzah, who had owned the mill since 1837. John H. Addams built the brick, federal-style house in two portions beginning in 1846. The smaller, northern part of the house was built in 1846, and in 1854 he added the larger southern portion of the house and its central entrance. Addams completed further alteration during the 1870s when he added a chimney and bay to the southern portion of the house, and a porch over the central front entrance. In 1956, after the home was purchased by Thomas Ennenga, the front porch was removed and a gable-style dormer was placed into the roof as part of extensive modernizations done to the home. The rear porch was also replaced at that time. Architecture This 1910 sketch depicts the mill building, which is no longer extant. The homestead also includes a Pennsylvania-style banked barn and the remains of Addams' mill. The barn is three and a half stories tall with dimensions of by . It lies east of the house, and, like all banked barns, is built into a slope. The ramp leads into the south side of the barn, and the threshing floor; on the building's north side is a cantilevered forebay. Instead of windows the barn has louvered vents. The whole building rests upon a limestone foundation. Most of Addams' grist mill has long since disappeared but there are some remains on the homestead site. Along Cedar Creek are the remains of the mill's limestone foundation, the dam, and the mill race. The mill pond has dried up and is now a grassy area. The original mill stood four stories tall. Significance Part of the Addams Homestead's significance is derived from the fact that Jane Addams was born there. John H. Addams was a prominent business leader and citizen in early Stephenson County. Besides his grist, saw and linseed mill, which became one of the largest in northern Illinois, Addams held positions in banks, railroad companies and was a founder of the Mutual Fire Insurance Company in 1867. He was active in politics much of his life and was a delegate to the state constitutional convention multiple times as well as serving an Illinois State Senator. His daughter, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jane Addams, was born in the house on September 6, 1860. During the 1970s the Illinois Historic Sites Survey noted the house for its significance as Jane Addams' birthplace.\\"T.

The western terminus is at PA 407 in Lackawanna State Park. The eastern terminus is at PA 438 in Scott Township. The route is a two- lane undivided road that runs through rural areas in northern Lackawanna County. Along the way, PA 524 has an interchange with Interstate 81 (I-81) and an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 347. The western portion of the route was designated as the northernmost section of PA 347 by 1930. The entire road was paved during the 1930s. PA 524 was designated in April 1961 as part of the construction of I-81 so that the latter would interchange with numbered state highways, replacing the northernmost portion of PA 347. Route description PA 524 approaching the intersection with PA 347 in Scott Township PA 524 begins at an intersection with PA 407 (North Abington Road) in the Carpenter Town area of North Abington Township. This intersection is within the boundaries of Lackawanna State Park. PA 524 heads to the northeast, paralleling PA 407 as Kennedy Creek Road through the park until the intersection with Rowland Road, where PA 524 heads eastward. A short distance after Rowlands Road, the highway leaves Lackawanna State Park. PA 524 winds through residences and fields south of East Benton, soon entering the hamlet of Craig. In Craig, there are a couple residences south of where State Route 4003 (SR 4003, Manning Road) terminates and SR 4007 (Craig Road) begins. At Craig Road, PA 524 turns eastward out of Craig, crosses an intersection with Stone Road, and enters Scott Township. Just beyond the township line, the road reaches Exit 199 of I-81. Crossing under I-81, the highway heads uphill and intersects with PA 347 (Justus Boulevard), which terminates. PA 524 turns onto the right-of-way for PA 347 and heads northward paralleling I-81 through Scott Township. Passing several residences, PA 524 terminates at an intersection with PA 438 (Montdale Road) in the community of Scott.  History  When Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, the current alignment of PA 524 was not given a number. By 1930, the portion of the road between PA 407 and the present northern terminus of PA 347 was designated as the northernmost part of PA 347, which was unpaved. This section of PA 347 was paved in the 1930s. In addition, the section of the present route east of PA 347 was also paved. PA 524 was created in April 1961 as part of several changes in northeastern Pennsylvania that included renumbering numerous highways and the creation of several state highways. PA 524 was designated as part of making sure that I-81 (the Penn-Can Highway) interchanged with state highways. The western section of the route replaced the northernmost portion of PA 347. When designated, PA 524 ran from PA 407 in Lackawanna State Park east to PA 438 in Scott.

Columbia has released a series of ten box sets containing recordings from the 1950s to the 1970s. These contain material not available on other Columbia albums. Following The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions, The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions, The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions, and The Cellar Door Sessions, this release includes the funk/jazz fusion album On the Corner. His band was made up of musicians trained not only in the basics of jazz, but on the newer sounds of James Brown and Sly Stone. The box set includes more than six hours of music. Twelve of these are previously unissued tracks. Another five tracks are previously unissued in full. They cover sixteen sessions from On the Corner, Big Fun, and Get Up with It until Davis's mid-seventies retirement. Miles is joined in these recordings by Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, John McLaughlin, Jack DeJohnette, Billy Hart, and many others. The 6-CD deluxe edition also contains a 120-page full-color booklet with liner notes and essays by producer Bob Belden, journalist Tom Terrell, and arranger/composer Paul Buckmaster as well as rare photographs and new illustrations.http://www.miles-beyond.com/otcbox.htm Recording history As with many of the Miles Davis boxed sets, the overall title is rather misleading. The On the Corner boxed set covers three years of sessions, from March 1972 to May 1975, and contains music with different styles, concepts, approaches and personnel. Similarly, The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions includes all of the sessions Davis recorded between August 1969 and February 1970, although the actual Bitches Brew sessions took place over just three days in August 1969. The sessions for the 1972 album On the Corner were recorded in June and September 1972. On the Corner was scorned by established jazz critics at the time of its release and was one of Davis' worst-selling recordings. Its critical standing has improved with the passage of time; today it is seen as a strong forerunner of the musical techniques of hip hop, drum and bass, and electronic music. Davis claimed that On the Corner was an attempt to connect with a young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for rock and funk. While there is a discernible rock and funk influence in the timbres of the instruments employed and the overall rhythms, the album was also a culmination of sorts of the musique concr√®te approach that Davis and producer Teo Macero started using in the late 1960s. (Macero had studied with Otto Luening at Columbia University's Computer Music Center). Both sides of the original album On the Corner were based around simple, repetitive drum and bass grooves (the track delineations on the original album were arbitrary). Melodic parts, such as from trumpet, saxophone, guitar and keyboards, were often selectively snipped from hours of jam sessions and overlaid atop the rhythms in the editing process. These techniques were developed in the 1940s and '50s by avant- grade composers but were uncommon in 1970s jazz and pop. Now, refined via the use of computers and digital audio equipment, such recording and editing methods are standard amongst producers of electronically based music. Davis also cited as inspirations during this era the contemporary composer Karlheinz Stockhausen (who was later falsely rumored to have recorded with the trumpeter in the late 1970s) and Paul Buckmaster (who played electric cello on the album and contributed some arrangements). Content The box set contains over three hours of previously unreleased material. On the November 6, 1974 date, guitarist Pete Cosey replaced Al Foster on drums on \\"Hip-Skip.\\" Later that day he returned to guitar for \\"What They Do\\", playing alongside Dominique Gaumont. \\"Minnie\\" is based on the Minnie Ripperton song \\"Loving You\\", and is considered to have an almost commercial disco sound, the most mainstream-sounding track of the collection. The Complete On the Corner Sessions also contains seven of the eight tracks that made up the 1974 double album Get Up with It. (The other track, \\"Honky Tonk\\", appears in unedited form on The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions.) Not included in the set is the \\"Molester\\" 7\\" single (a different mix of \\"Black Satin\\"), although the record label is included in the booklet. Track listing This list is the same as the provisional one that was published in early 2007, but the CD order was swapped, some of the previously unreleased tracks were edited, and titles were given by Vince Wilburn, Davis' nephew, and Erin Davis, Miles' youngest son.

It is a small, more or less prostrate shrub with aromatic, elliptic to oblong leaves and red flowers. Description Prostanthera calycina is a more or less prostrate shrub that typically grows to a height of about and has more or less cylindrical, hairy branches. The leaves are well-spaced along the branchlets, elliptic to oblong, long and wide on a densely hairy petiole long. The leaves are strongly aromatic when crushed. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils on a hairy pedicel long. The sepals are long forming a tube long with two lobes long and wide. The petals are long forming a tube long with two lips. The middle lobe on the lower lip is about long and wide, the side lobes about long. The upper lip has two lobes about long and joined but with a small notch between them. Flowering occurs between September and December. Taxonomy Prostanthera calycina was first formally described in 1870 by George Bentham from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller and the description was published in Flora Australiensis. Distribution and habitat West coast mintbush is only known from the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia where it usually grows on limestone outcrops in mallee vegetation. Conservation status West coast mintbush is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the South Australian Government National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. The main threats to the species include grazing, habitat fragmentation and road maintenance. Use in horticulture This mintbush is easily propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Prostanthera nivea and grows best in dry climates in well drained soil.

Sovetskaya Latviya was a broadsheet that appeared daily, except Mondays. During the Soviet period, it dominated the Russian-language newspapers market in Latvia together with the Latvian Komsomol daily Sovetskaya Molod√´zh' (Soviet Youth). In 1975, its circulation was 107,500 copies. During the late 1980s, Sovetskaya Latviya expressed an editorial line critical of the movement for re- establishing Latvia's independence, reflecting the stance of the Communist Party leadership around Alfrƒìds Rubiks. Following Latvia's regaining of independence from the USSR, in October 1991 Sovetskaya Latviya changed its name to Panorama Latvii (, ). The editorial line that harshly criticised the policies of the Latvian government was maintained, particularly concerning the treatment of Russians in Latvia. In 2002, the publisher has concluded an agreement on financial support with the Equal Rights party. Panorama Latvii ceased to be published in 2003.

Its significance emerges in Lurianic Kabbalah as part of the process of Tohu and Tikun. Nekudim is the second of three stages to emerge from Adam Kadmon (Akudim, Nekudim, Berudim). Luria read these from the esoteric meaning of Jacob's breeding of Laban's flocks in Genesis 30:27-43. In Nekudim the Sephirot manifest as 10 lights in 10 isolated (point-like) vessels, without interaction. This corresponds to Olam HaTohu (the \\"World of Chaos\\"), the archetype of disorder in Creation, precipitating Shevirat HaKeilim (\\"Shattering of the sephirot Vessels\\").  The source of the world of Nekudim  In the world of Nekudim, light emanates metaphorically out of the \\"eyes\\" of Adam Kadmon (AK), and descends to encompass AK from \\"naval\\" to \\"feet.\\"Olam HaNekudim The World of Points from inner.org  \\"Lights\\" and \\"Vessels\\" in the world of Nekudim  In the realm of Nekudim, ten individual vessels are created to contain the ten sephirot lights of this world. The vessels are small, undeveloped or \\"immature\\". Relative to the fully developed vessels in the world of Atzilut, the vessels of Nekudim are merely \\"points\\". Unlike the world of Akudim, where the ten lights flow freely in and out of the single vessel in the process of \\"mati v'lo mati\\", in the world of Nekudim all of the lights enter, forcefully, into their respective vessels and break them. The world of Nekudim is generally referred to as Olam HaTohu (the \\"World of Chaos\\"). Tohu is characterised by high lights and weak vessels. The vessels' weakness derives from the Sephirot acting in the scheme of Iggulim (concentric \\"Circles\\"), without interacting and strengthening each other through harmony. Often the two worlds of Akudim and Nekudim are considered to be two forms of Tohu-Chaos, relatively \\"stable chaos\\" (Akudim, the form of \\"chaos\\" which doesn't break) and \\"unstable chaos\\" (Nekudim, the form of \\"chaos\\" which breaks). In modern scientific Chaos Theory these two forms of \\"chaos\\" are described in relation to the physical world.  Manifestations of the world of Nekudim in human beings  In the human soul, this is compared to a youth who possesses distinct but limited language skills, which hold him back from truly expressing his emotions. In the human soul the shattering of vessels of Nekudim is like a psychological \\"breakdown\\" (resulting from the trauma of adolescence). Relative to the physiology of the human body this is like \\"death\\"; the lights (\\"soul\\") returns to its source, the broken vessels (\\"the physical body\\") falls into the lower realms of reality (\\"burial ground\\"). However, contained within the broken vessels are \\"sparks\\" of life-force which, though temporarily hidden insure the eventual \\"resurrection\\" of the broken vessels.  The Emissaries who correspond to Nekudim  The lights of the world of Nekudim, which emanate from the \\"eyes\\" of Adam Kadmon, correspond to the spiritual soul-root of those souls of Israel whose primary goal and purpose in life is to act as a \\"messenger\\" or \\"emissary\\" of God and His Mashiach (\\"Anointed One\\") and bring the light and goodness of God in order to permeate all consciousness with the reality that \\"God is King of the Earth.\\" According to this explanation, the meaning of the \\"breaking of the vessels\\" is that these first \\"messengers\\" did not succeed in their mission. Rather than recognizing that God alone rules over all of reality, each of these \\"kings\\" of Tohu (hinted to in the Torah as the Kings of Edom who rule before the kingdom of Israel) said \\"I shall rule,\\" as taught at length in Kabbalah.

History  It was built in the late 19th century as a guest house in a popular Zakopane Style and expanded in 1926 to include seven rooms. The name 'Atma' (added in the 1920s), is derived from the Sanskrit word for 'soul'. The house was rented by Szymanowski for six years between 1930 and 1936 as his main residence before his death in 1937. It was purchased through a fundraising campaign led by writer Jerzy Waldorff in Communist Poland, and has opened its doors as a museum on March 6, 1976. Museum The composer Szymanowski visited Zakopane in his childhood. The Villa Atma became his permanent residence when he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and left his position of Director at the Warsaw Conservatory in 1930. He described the villa in a letter to his mother as \\"a small, humble mountaineer's cottage\\". Amongst the fellow artists who visited Szymanowski in Villa Atma were Artur Rubinstein, Serge Lifar and Emil M≈Çynarski. After Szymanowski's death in 1937, his friends suggested making the Villa a museum in his honour, but this aim was not achieved until 1976 when the house was purchased by the \\"Atma\\" Committee and donated to the National Museum of Poland. The exhibits include a close recreation of the composer's study, in which he wrote some of his most notable works including the Symphony No. 4, (a sinfonia concertante for piano and orchestra dedicated to Rubinstein), and his second Violin Concerto. The exhibit is decorated with his portrait painted by Young Poland's leading painter and art theoretician Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz. The museum is located in Zakopane at ul.
