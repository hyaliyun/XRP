History  The village is named after Pubo Mann, a commander in the reign of king Ram Singh of Jaijon Douaba. Ram Singh took over Jaijon in AD 1701. Pubo won a major battle fighting with Nadir Shah's military in 1739 and was awarded the land by Ram Singh. Originally from Bathinda, Punjab, Pubo brought his family, along with members of the Brahmin and other castes, to settle this village in the 1740s. He established the area as distinct village for the first time. The number of Brahmin residents has given rise to the production of laureates from the village at the time when nearby all villages comprised illiterate populations. After some time, the village was subdivided, leading to the creation of Bilna, Haleran, Aujle and Badewale. Those newer villages got their own panchayats recently.  Geography  Pubowal has an average elevation of 498 metres in the district Una of Himachal Pradesh which lies in its south western part. Punjabi, Hindi, are common languages spoken.

Because of this trade it became known as the Dutch Pool. This name was because locals pronounced Deutsch as Dutch. The actual Dutch visitors were called Hollanders. Flint stones are to be found round the shores of the Pool and as flint does not occur naturally in Shetland, it is assumed these are discarded ballast stones from the continental boats. At the end of the 16th century the Pool silted up and became much as it is today, with the only anchorage available towards the east end or in the Virkie Marina which was formed in the 1980s.

Development The SM.78 first flew at the end of 1932, designed for the role of maritime reconnaissance-bomber. It was one of the many flying boats made by SIAI (Savoia-Marchetti), that in 1915 had started building foreign aircraft under licence, followed two years later by the first of its own designs. The SM.78 was developed from the SM.62bis. The prototype, which carried the serial number MM222, made its first flight late in 1932Donald 1997, p. 823. and then transferred the next year to Vigna di Valle for evaluation. The SM.78 was the last biplane flying boat, built or used in large numbers by Italy; 49 were completed in all (32 by Piaggio and 17 by SIAI). =Technical description= The SM.78 was a single-bay biplane. It had a long and slim aft fuselage, with a tall welded steel fin and a wooden horizontal tail mounted centrally. The lower hull had two steps, to aid take- off from the sea. This aircraft evolved from the SM.62bis, retaining practically the same unmodified wings, tail and fuselage, but with a different model of Handley Page flaps. The hull/fuselage had poplar frames, and longerons made of ash. The plywood-skinned hull had a double-layered bottom, with an external layer of cedar, while the flanks were made from orthogonally arranged laminates of cedar. The fabric-covered wings had spruce longerons and poplar ribs, utilising the low-weight and high-strength characteristics of these woods, and were painted to render them impermeable to water. Twin stabilising floats were mounted at mid-wing. While the pilot and co-pilot were seated side-by-side in an enclosed cockpit in the prototype, this was replaced by an open cockpit in the production model. A crew position mounting a 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Lewis Gun was situated in the nose, which also contained two cameras. This position was manned by the co-pilot when necessary, the aircraft having a three-man crew. A second, enclosed turret was fitted in the dorsal position, also armed with a 7.7 mm (.303 in) Lewis gun, manned by the gunner/radio operator, who was also provided with an R.A.350 transmitter and an A.R.4 receiver. The aircraft was not fitted with an intercom, but the two pilots could communicate with the nose position using a \\"pneumatic message\\" system in which messages were passed through a tube. The forward machine gun had 564 rounds of ammunition in 12 magazines, while the aft machine gun had 470 in 10 magazines. Bombs were carried in a bomb bay within the lower wing, near to the fuselage. The weapon-load was 700 kg (1,540 lb) maximum. Typical combinations were: 2 √ó 250 kg (550 lb) and 2 √ó 100 kg (220 lb) bombs, 6 √ó 100 kg (220 lb) bombs, 4 √ó 70 kg (150 lb) depth charges, or 6 √ó 12 kg (26 lb) training bombs. Smoke generators could also be mounted on the inner hardpoints. A \\"Jozza\\" bombsight was located on the right in the cockpit, behind a glazed window. The aircraft was powered by a single Isotta Fraschini Asso 750 W18 engine, generating 671 kW (900 hp) at takeoff, arranged in a steel structure mounted between the two wings, driving a four-bladed propeller with variable pitch that could be set before takeoff. This, and the much refined hull of this aircraft bestowed a good performance for the time. A CO¬≤ fire extinguisher was mounted by the engine. A total of 2,200 L (580 US gal) of fuel could be carried in six unarmoured duralumin fuselage tanks, two aft, two central and two forward. Operational history The SM.78 was built between 1932 and 1935, with only 16 by SIAI and 32 from Piaggio. It equipped the 141¬∞ Squadriglia, based at La Spezia, the 144¬∞ based at Livorno, the 182¬∞ at Nisida and the 189¬∞ at Syracuse. It continued to serve until 1938, being replaced by the CANT Z.501, a monoplane design with superior performance. Some aircraft remained in service during the early phase of World War II, performing in an air-sea-rescue capacity. Spain, which already operated SM.62s, tried unsuccessfully to acquire a licence to build the SM.78, leaving Italy as the only operator.

Casemate Publishers. or BG-107 is an EU Battlegroup. It originally consisted of military elements from the Netherlands (720 soldiers), Germany (800 soldiers), and Finland (200 soldiers). From 1 January 2007 until 30 June 2007, it was on standby under German leadership. In preparation for its second standby period in the first half of 2011, when it was also known as EUBG 2011/1, its composition changed; Austrian and Lithuanian troops were added, the Netherlands took over command.  History  Dutch minister of Defence Henk Kamp and his EU colleagues agreed upon the formation of the Dutch‚ÄìGerman‚ÄìFinnish battlegroup on 22 November 2004 in Brussels. Because the Finnish were assigned to intelligence work, they were informally known as the \\"Nokia brigade\\". The final exercise took place at the German air base at Leipheim in late 2006. Following the exercise, lieutenant-general Hans Sonneveld, second-in-command of the Dutch forces, commented that the EU Battlegroups are a new step towards the \\"rising self-awareness of Europe\\".  Composition and equipment  Battlegroup 107 originally consisted of 720 Dutch soldiers, 800 German soldiers and 200 Finnish soldiers. The Netherlands provided an infantry company, a medical taskforce, a logistics battalion, headquarters personnel and an intelligence unit. Germany provided many infantry troops, Finland provided armoured vehicles for camp security. Besides armoured vehicles, anti-tank weapons and light machine guns, the battlegroup has a German frigate and German destroyers at its disposal. The Netherlands also provide a frigate and fighter aircraft and attack helicopters if necessary.  Exercises  From 30 September to 8 October 2010, the Battlegroup conducted training exercises in the Dutch‚ÄìBelgian triangle Oirschot, Brasschaat and Maasmechelen. The operation, codenamed \\"European Rhino 1\\", centred on supporting the government of the fictitious country of 'Blueland' in restoring and maintaining order after ethnic tensions between the minority in power and other groups within the population erupted. From 30 November until 12 December 2010, operation \\"European Rhino 2\\" was carried out in Budel, Netherlands, where the 300 members of staff were trained.

Another (but improper) way in calling it is \\"Euromortgage\\". It is currently a research project undertaken by several researchers European-wide. The Eurohypothec has appeared for the first time in an official document of the European Union in the Green Paper about the Mortgage Credit in the EU and has found a degree of acceptance among the European mortgage market stakeholders, scientific authors and authorities. History The Eurohypothec idea was already conceived by Prof. Claudio Segr√© during the 1960s and was further developed by other institutions like the International Union of Latin Notaries, until our days in which researchers like Dr. Wehrens and Dr. O. St√∂cker have pushed forward the idea. Objectives The objective of the Eurohypothec is to create a pan European, flexible and secure mortgage instrument that allows as many businesses as possible in a trans-national way: syndicated loans, securitisation, efficient covered/mortgage bonds business, etc. It also brings advantages to mortgagors, who would be able to change their credit institutions more efficiently, fast and cheaply. Model The model has been developed by a pool of researchers and practitioners, mainly devoted to private law matters and the result was condensed in the so-called \\"Basic Guidelines for a Eurohypothec\\", which were published in Warsaw in 2005. Its main features are: * Right in rem to secure one or more obligations/loans between the borrower and the same or different lenders. * It does not substitute national mortgages. * No need of obligation/loan to exist. * It may secure as many obligations/loans as mortgagor and mortgagee want to. * Contractual relationship between the mortgage and the credit/loan through a so-called \\"security agreement\\" The Basic Guidelines model has helped to develop the changes in mortgage law legislation in France (2007) and the Law Project in Spain (2007). Related instruments to the Eurohypothec are the Eurotrust and the Eurotitle. References * NASARRE-AZNAR, Sergio, \\"Eurohypothec & Eurotrust.

Showing flags of the 8 establishing countries: Kingdom of Egypt, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mutwakilite Kingdom of Yemen, Hashimite Kingdom of Syria, Hashimite Kingdom of Iraq, Hashimite Kingdom of Jordan, Republic of Lebanon and Palestine In its early years, the Arab League concentrated mainly on economic, cultural and social programs. In 1959, it held the first Arab Petroleum Congress, and in 1964, established the Arab League Educational, Cultural, and Scientific Organization. In 1974, despite objections by Jordan, the league recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinians. The League was weakened over the years by internal dissensions on political issues, especially those concerning Israel and the Palestinians and later on by the three Gulf wars. After Egypt signed a separate peace treaty with Israel on March 26, 1979, other Arab League members met in Baghdad and voted to suspend Egypt's membership and transfer the League's headquarters from Cairo to Tunis. In May 1989, nine years later, Egypt was readmitted and resumed membership. The headquarters returned to Cairo in 1990.Arab Unity - \\"Peace after the Yom Kippur War?\\" - Al Jazeera - Retrieved 31 January 2011. This step was sharply disputed as members of the League were deeply divided over the Kuwait crisis and the invitation extended by Saudi Arabia to the United States, which allowed foreign military build-up in its Eastern province. The League was effectively paralyzed by the eruption of the Gulf crisis, and its future as a regional organization became highly uncertain. Until the Israeli‚ÄìLebanese war in the summer of 2006, the League had started making positive moves and was starting to regain respect with the Jewish public and media. Foundation Arab citizens in general perceive themselves as one people divided among a number of states with history, geography, language, culture, and socio- economic interests propelling them to forge one great Arab Nation (Arabism). The British Empire realized this in the early part of the twentieth century, which helped them secure the cooperation of the Arabs, leading them to revolt (Arab Revolt) against the Turkish Ottoman Empire during World War I. The British promised to help the Arabs establish a united Arab kingdom under Sherif Hussein of Mecca, which would encompass the Asian part of the Arab World (including the modern day Arabian peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel and Jordan). After winning the war, however, the British betrayed Sharif Hussein and instead helped divide the region into mini states, implementing their policy of \\"Divide and Rule\\".(Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement). The British needed Arab cooperation once more during World War II, and again returned to play the Pan Arabism card by encouraging the formation of the League. Many Arab intellectuals believe that the British did not want the League to act as a step towards Arab unity, but actually used the League to prevent it. Proposed names Several suggestions were made for the name of the organization: Iraq suggested Arab Union; Syria suggested Arab Alliance; and Egypt proposed the Arab League. Egypt's proposal was adopted, and later amended to the League of Arab States.

The oval started off as little more than a rough paddock and the \\"clubrooms\\" consisted of a simple tin shed. However, through the commitment of its members, committees and the assistance of the former City of Sunshine, permanent change-rooms which are still used today were constructed and a formal playing surface was prepared. Albanvale Football Club currently has approximately 260 registered players competing in Under 10, Under 13, Under 15, Under 18, Reserve and Senior grades. Many of the players have had a long association with the Club and it is not unusual for players to achieve significant career milestones as 150 or 200 games whilst still playing within the Junior ranks. The Club is competitive at all levels with a number of premiership victories at different Junior levels.

It differs from other Australian Accounting societies: CPA Australia, Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia, Institute of Public Accountants due to this focus.  History  The ICMA became a legal reality when its first Constitution was adopted on October 11, 1996; and subsequently incorporated under the Associations Incorporations Act 1981 (Vic).) on November 12, 1996. In March 1997, at a meeting of the Founding Members it was decided that Mr Leon Duval (a practicing chartered accountant and management accountant of some 25 years standing) be elected as Interim-President. A room in Mr Duval's office at Suite 6, 242 Hawthorne Road, Caulfield, was the first address and secretariat of ICMA. Under Mr Duval's name, letters of invitation were sent to over 150 leading professionals and academics in the field of management accounting, to join the new institute as Foundation Members. Almost immediately 75 individuals accepted the invitation. The initial Executive Committee of the Institute was drawn from its Foundation Members. Today, ICMA is a full-service institute for its members and other stakeholders. The services provided by ICMA Secretariat include maintaining the corporate website that is in keeping with the international profile of ICMA; which includes the designing and maintaining a Members Only area on the website. ICMA publishes 6 copies of the On Target eNewsletter annually, and has a bi- annual research journal, Management Accounting Frontiers (MAF). It maintains a Library by over 12,000 texts and professional and academic publications. ICMA also provides the training and conducts examinations for its education program in all of its Regional and Branch locations and in over 20 other countries where students undertake the CMA program by online and via distance education. ICMA maintains the CEO Blog, with links to LinkedIn and Twitter. For those members who already possess the CMA, ICMA provides Continuing Professional Development (CPD) opportunities to members via its Certificates of Proficiency. The ICMA is accredited by the Commonwealth of Nations under the category of Civic Organisations.  Education Program  The flagship CMA Preparatory Program, consists of two subjects, Strategic Cost Management and Strategic Business Analysis for which the entry criteria is either a degree in accounting or a recognised professional qualification in accounting. The CMA Preparatory Program was only open to those with a university degree in accounting; or a recognised professional qualification in accounting. In addition to passing the two subjects, one needed to have 5-years of business experience to qualify as a Certified Management Accountant (CMA). Thus, ICMA designed the first post-graduate level management accounting qualification in the world. There were other unique aspects to ICMA's Education program. It was the first professional body in the world to embed its CMA subjects within master's degree programs in accredited universities; and allow those universities to examine students internally. Today, many other professional bodies have followed this lead.  Membership Grades and Pathways  The Institute has the following grades of membership: # Fellow Certified Management Accountant (FCMA); # Certified Management Accountant (CMA); # Associate Management Accountant (AMA); # Graduate Management Accountant (GMA); # Registered Business Accountant (RBA); # Registered Cost Accountant (RCA); # Certified Accounting Technician (CAT); # Student member and # Honorary member for distinguished persons for services to Management Accounting and related disciplines. Each of these membership levels follows the ICMA Education program requiring different educational achievements and experience. Individuals can obtain ICMA membership via a number of possible pathways. There are different education and experience requirements for: (a) University Graduates in Accounting/Finance; (b) MBA Degree Holders; (c) University Graduates with Non-Accounting Degrees; (d) Diploma and Advanced Diploma Holders in Accounting; (e) Members of Other Professional Accounting Bodies; (f) Members of Other Professional Non-Accounting Bodies; (g) Part Qualified Students of Other Professional Accounting Bodies: (h) School Leavers and (i) Academics.  Research and Publications  = Newsletter = The On Target newsletter (bi-monthly) was mailed to members from September 1997 to February 2011. ICMA decided to stop the print format of a magazine to members and launched an electronic Newsletter that could be downloaded in pdf form in February 2011. Today, the articles for On Target Direct are uploaded continuously in the Members‚Äô Area of the Institute's website. The contents are also sent as an e-journal on a monthly basis to financial members; and a pdf version of On Target is emailed to them bi-monthly. In addition to the Newsletters, a Yearbook with a report to members and significant articles has been sent out since 2011. = Research Journal = The Journal of Applied Management Accounting Research (JAMAR) was launched in 2002, with the joint- editors being (at the time of launch) Professor Garry Marchant of the University of Melbourne and Professor Janek Ratnatunga, the Chair of Business Accounting at Monash University. The journal was published both in print form and online. It was published bi-annually in both print and electronic formats. JAMAR is catalogued by the ProQuest and Cabell's Research publication directories. In 2018, Management Accounting Frontiers (MAF) replaced the Journal of Applied Management Accounting Research as the research journal of the Institute of Certified Management Accountants, Australia. The primary aim of the MAF is to advance research and practice of management accounting by providing a forum for disseminating knowledge and insight of the discipline. In addition, the journal aims to facilitate the developments of management accounting education by encouraging communication between researchers and practitioners. = Library = The Library now has over 12,000 texts and professional and academic publications, and has now one of the best libraries in Australia in the professional areas of management accounting and risk management. = Research Bodies = In 2009 the institute established two non- profit companies. The Institute of Certified Carbon Analysts and Auditors (ICCAA) was established to undertake research into the emerging area of carbonomics; and to develop an education program to train an individual to qualify as a Certified Carbon Analyst and Auditor (CCAA). The second research and training body was the Institute for the Advancement of Corporate Reporting and Assurance (IACRA); established to undertake research into integrated reporting and assurance; and to develop an education program to train an individual to qualify as a Certified Reporting and Assurance Analyst (CRAA). Both these qualifications are registered ICMA trademarks. In November 2012, the ICCAA got full admission as an observer organisation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).This was a significant achievement in terms of global recognition.  Global Activities  ICMA has over 10,000 qualified professionals worldwide, with members in 50-countries. Its CMA postgraduate education program now is firmly established in 19 overseas markets, namely Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Cyprus, Dubai, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nepal, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines; Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. To facilitate its educational objectives, the Institute has accredited a number of universities which have master's degree subjects that are equivalent to the CMA program. Some of these universities also provide in-house training and examinations of the CMA program. Accounting graduates can do CMA accredited units at these universities to qualify for CMA status. The ICMA also has a number of Recognised Provider Institutions (RPIs) that run the CMA program in Australia and overseas. The CMA program is also available online in regions where the face-to-face delivery of the program is not possible. ICMA also has global activities in the following markets: Continuing Education Market: ICMA has recognised that there is an executive market that requires specialised training in specific areas. As such it has commissioned the development of a series of Certificates of Proficiency in varied topics. Higher Education Market: ICMA has recognised many members are looking for further education via a Master of Business Administration (MBA) and those that have an MBA, are looking for a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA). As such, ICMA has sponsored the development of an MBA and a DBA program specifically to its members via Calwest University in California. High-Flyer Student Market: ICMA has decided not to focus only on experienced executives; but also focus on the next generation of management accountants. As such it has introduced the Emerging Professional Scholarship Program to train the next generation of management accountants. Business Graduates Market: ICMA has recognised that there are senior managers who are not interested in becoming accountants. As such it has introduced a new certified qualification; the Certified Global Business Analyst (CGBA) for those interested in finance and business analysis, but not interested in continuing further to become CMAs. This qualification is tailored to senior managers who have degrees or professional qualifications in all business fields (marketing, management, finance, banking, accounting etc.). Islamic Professional Education Market: There is strong demand from Islamic countries for a 4-day program for already qualified generalist accountants to be versed in Islamic Accounting & Auditing and Islamic Banking & Finance. As such ICMA is proposing launching a Certified Islamic Public Accountant (CIPA) professional qualification in 2017. In 2014, ICMA launched of the International Management Accounting Collaborative (IMAC). ICMA was the founder charter member of the IMAC, which is now the global organization for the management accountancy profession dedicated to serving the public interest by strengthening the profession and contributing to the development of strong international economies. IMAC is particularly committed to enhancing the decision-making capabilities of organisations; and in promoting good governance, risk management and sustainability, which are the key elements in achieving long term social, environmental and economic performance, and in enhancing investor and other stakeholder confidence. Professional management accountants have an important role to play in these areas, and IMAC is uniquely positioned to support member bodies in enhancing the competence and expertise of their members. To commemorate its 20th Anniversary, ICMA established the Global Accounting Hall of Fame and the Management Accounting Hall of Fame in Australia and each of the regions ICMA operated in. The Accounting Hall of Fame is a general award open to all accountants, CFOs etc., Financial and Managerial. There will be an academic and practitioner award in this category. The Management Accounting Hall of Fame.is an award open only to managerial accountants, CFOs, Strategy Analysts etc. (i.e. those not doing compliance work).

She later became a nurse. In 1903 she married Thomas Bevan with whom she would have four children. Thomas Bevan died suddenly in 1914. Sideshow career Bevan started exhibiting the symptoms of acromegaly soon after she was married, around the age of 32.American Philosophical Society. 6 August 1924. \\"Mary Bevan and her children\\". Accessed 22 August 2007. She began to suffer from abnormal growth and facial distortion, which led to her \\"homely\\" appearance, along with severe headaches and fading eyesight. After the death of her husband in 1914, she no longer had the income to support herself and her four children. Bevan decided to capitalize on her appearance and entered a \\"Homeliest Woman\\" contest which she won. In 1920, she was hired by Sam Gumpertz to appear in Coney Island's Dreamland sideshow, a form of freak show, where she would spend most of the remainder of her life. She also made appearances for the Ringling Brothers Circus until her death. Bevan is buried in the Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries. Legacy In the early 2000s, Bevan's image was used on a birthday card in the United Kingdom made by Hallmark Cards. The card made reference to the dating show Blind Date. A complaint was made by a Dutch doctor that it was disrespectful to a woman who had become deformed as the result of a disease.

The western terminus is at State Route 4004 (SR 4004) at a junction with Mountain Road, Valley Road, and Community Road in the community of Upper Strasburg in Letterkenny Township. The eastern terminus is at PA 233 in Newville. PA 533 heads east from Upper Strasburg as a two-lane undivided road through farmland, passing to the north of Letterkenny Army Depot before crossing PA 997 in Pleasant Hall. The route continues east and crosses PA 433 in Orrstown before reaching Shippensburg, where it reaches U.S. Route 11 (US 11). Here, PA 533 becomes concurrent with US 11 and intersects PA 696 in the downtown area and PA 174 upon leaving Shippensburg. PA 533 splits from US 11 and runs northeast through more agricultural areas before reaching Newville. The section of road between Upper Strasburg and Pleasant Hall was designated as part of PA 333 in 1928. PA 533 was designated in 1930 to run from PA 433 in Orrstown east to US 11 in Shippensburg. The same year, PA 633 was designated to run from Upper Strasburg east to PA 333 (now PA 997) in Pleasant Hall after PA 333 was realigned. In 1937, PA 533 was extended west to PA 944 in Upper Strasburg, replacing all of PA 633, and extended east to PA 233 in Newville. The intersecting PA 944 designation was removed from the western terminus in the 1940s. Route description PA 533 in Upper Strasburg PA 533 begins at an intersection with SR 4004 (Mountain Road/Valley Road) and Community Road in the community of Upper Strasburg in Letterkenny Township, Franklin County. At the western terminus, Valley Road heads to the west, Mountain Road heads to the north, and Community Road heads to the south. From this intersection, the route heads east on two-lane undivided Upper Strasburg Road past homes before heading into open farmland with a few residences, forming the northern boundary of the Letterkenny Army Depot. In the community of Pleasant Hall, PA 533 crosses PA 997. Past this intersection, the route becomes Orrstown Road and heads away from the Letterkenny Army Depot, continuing through more agricultural areas with occasional homes. The road curves northeast and heads into Southampton Township and passes through more rural areas before entering the borough of Orrstown. Here, PA 533 is lined with homes and intersects PA 433. The route heads back into Southampton Township and runs through more farmland with a few residences, turning to the east. Farther east, the road heads into the borough of Shippensburg and becomes North Morris Street, passing several homes. PA 533 becomes the border between Cumberland County to the north and Franklin County to the south and runs through more residential areas of Shippensburg, intersecting US 11. At this point, the route turns northeast to form a concurrency with US 11 on West King Street, fully entering Cumberland County. The road heads into the commercial downtown, reaching an intersection with PA 696. Here, PA 696 joins US 11/PA 533 and runs through more of the downtown. PA 696 splits to the north and US 11/PA 533 becomes East King Street, leaving the downtown and heading into more residential areas. Upon intersecting the western terminus of PA 174, the road heads into Shippensburg Township and passes a few businesses before heading into a mix of farmland and woodland with a few homes. US 11/PA 533 continues into Southampton Township and becomes Ritner Highway. PA 533 splits from US 11 by heading northwest onto Newville Road. The route curves to the northeast and runs through open agricultural areas with some residences and woods. The road passes to the east of a quarry before it continues into North Newton Township and continues through agricultural surroundings. At the Oakville Road junction, PA 533 becomes Shippensburg Road and runs through more rural areas. The road continues into the borough of Newville and becomes Fairfield Avenue, turning east into residential areas. PA 533 becomes Vine Street at the West Big Spring Avenue intersection and continues east to its terminus at PA 233. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 533 was not assigned a number. At this time, the roadway between Upper Strasburg and Shippensburg was an unpaved road. By 1928, the road between Orrstown and Shippensburg was paved while PA 333 was designated onto the section of unpaved road between Upper Strasburg and Pleasant Hall. In 1930, PA 533 was designated to run from PA 433 in Orrstown east to US 11 in Shippensburg while PA 633 was designated to run from Upper Strasburg east to PA 333 (now PA 997) in Pleasant Hall after PA 333 was realigned to a more direct route between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury. By this time, PA 633 was a paved road while the unnumbered roadways between Pleasant Hall and Orrstown and Shippensburg and Newville were unpaved. In 1937, PA 533 was extended west from Orrstown to PA 944 (Community Road/Mountain Road) in Upper Strasburg, replacing the entire length of PA 633, and was extended east from Shippensburg to PA 233 in Newville. The entire length of PA 533 was paved in the 1930s. In the 1940s, the intersecting PA 944 designation was removed at the western terminus, leaving PA 533 ending at an unnumbered road.

It served with the Regia Aeronautica and with a number of foreign users, and was licence-produced in Spain and the Soviet Union. Some of the Spanish aircraft were still in service during the Spanish Civil War Design and development The SM.62 flying boat was one of the main successes of Savoia-Marchetti, evolved from the SM.59 which first flew in 1925. The single-engine, single-spar wing, wooden biplane aircraft was powered by a single Isotta Fraschini Asso 500 R.I., engine mounted between the upper and the lower wings, and drove a pusher propeller. It had a wingspan of , a maximum takeoff weight of including fuel, bombs and four crew, and entered production in 1926. Apart from the two machine guns in the aft and forward fuselage, both mounted in uncovered positions, the possibility of fitting an Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was explored, but never put into service. The progress of the project was almost continuous, and the following year saw the SM.62bis development that had a more powerful engine. This aircraft, with a wingspan, formed the basis of the future SM.78. The new Isotta Fraschini Asso 750 engine produced 50% more power, which allowed a maximum take-off weight of with a maximum speed of , while the range was .

The rebellion followed the Svaneti uprising of 1921 and was organized by the Committee for Independence of Georgia and its Military Committee, consisting of the former officers of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. The leader of the movement was Prince Kakutsa Cholokashvili, colonel of the Georgian army, formerly a Polkovnik in the Imperial Russian Army and hero of the Battle of Sarikamish during World War I. Since the spring of 1921 Cholokashvili organized strong militia in Kakheti and Khevsureti from experienced Georgian army personnel and noblemen including M. Lashkarashvili, Simon Bagration-Mukhraneli, L. Lekvinadze, S. Andronikashvili, A. Sumbatashvili, Sh. Vachnadze, P. Palavandishvili, Sh. Palavandishvili, etc. The militia had a close contact to Catholicos-Patriarch Ambrose and enjoyed the support of the mountainous clans of eastern Georgia. First, the militiamen blocked all the roads to Tusheti, Pshavi, and Khevsureti and after winning the battle in Zhinvali, the army moved in Khevsureti. Notably, the Bolsheviks used vast inexperienced military resources, including combat aviation, against the militiamen and had heavy casualties whereas the casualties of Cholokashvili's force was zero in some casesA. Surguladze, P. Surguladze. History of Georgia, 1783-1990. Tbilisi, 1992. The rebellion was weakened from disagreement within different political parties of Georgia. For example, Social Democrats thought that Cholokashvili, a nobleman, should not be the leader of a Partisan army. On the other hand, the Bolsheviks arrested and executed supporters of militia in Kartli and Kakheti and moved more army divisions from Grozny. Combination of hostility of Cheka towards the population of Georgia and disagreement between different political parties forced Cholokashvili to escape to the neighboring Chechnya, whence he made several inroads into Georgia, preventing the Bolsheviks from gaining a foothold in the eastern Georgian mountains before joining the major revolt against the Soviets in August 1924.

WRKE-LP is owned and operated by Roanoke College. The station currently employs 70 Roanoke College Students and broadcasts from the main floor of the Colket Center of Roanoke College. Background WRKE is a student run, non-commercial radio station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to Roanoke College. WRKE is a advised under a professional advisory board. The station is under manager and adviser Rick Mattioni, and program director Elijah Wilhelm. The station plays on an automated system playing alternative/indie music when student DJs are not on air. Student shows vary from sports-talk, alternative, pop, or hip-hop. History The station got its start in 1998 when Jim Goodwin formed a club to establish a radio station on campus. Equipment was obtained and the station went on the air November 2005 with music played via computer automation until students returned after winter break to establish programming and shows. The station is building a fan base on campus and beyond as far as its low power transmitter can carry. While the broadcast radius is a mere 3 miles, this covers most of the Roanoke College community. Over the summer of 2016 a new, larger, more accessible on-air studio was built on Colket's main floor just a few feet from the Center's front doors and across the hall from the Commons. The upgrade enhances WRKE's ability to conduct interviews in roomier surroundings; produce live (and recorded) specials such as election night coverage and music performances; and increases the station's visibility. Beginning in early 2017, WRKE experienced unprecedented growth resulting in the station growing from 13 students, hosting 8 shows to 75 students, hosting 34 shows. WRKE also began its live and special events during this time. Events included Outlast, a competition similar to Big Brother, live radio dramas with the theater department, and live events from down in the Cavern. For their progress WRKE, under Program Director Elijah Wilhelm, won the Student Organization of the Year award for both the 2016-17 school year and the 2017-2018 school year. This is the only time the award has been won by the same organization in back to back years. Programming The station is DJ'd by Roanoke College students throughout the week during the academic year, and the station plays on an automated system playing alternative music when student DJs are not on air. Student shows vary from sports-talk, alternative, pop, or hip-hop. Over the past year WRKE has also expanded its speciality event programming included joint collaborations with the RC theatre and athletic departments, remote broadcasts from local businesses, live audience shows for students, radio dramas, and a reality game competition.

It is a part of Dhanaulti tehsil and is administered by the municipality of Chamba. Uniyalgaon is located on the foothills 4 km from Surkanda Devi temple, 40 km from Dehradun and 26 km from Mussoorie. It is served by schools in Satyon and a hospital in Chamba, 12 km away. The village is accessible by Rishikesh-Tehri Road and the National Highway 94. History The exact period of establishment is debatable but it is probable that it was settled in before 10th century AD. Before the construction of major highways and roads, the village was accessible by forest trails through the hills connecting it to towns and cities. Before India's Independence, it was administered under the Kingdom of Garhwal. Development in the area was not visible for several years after India's Independence and farming was the only occupation. Fauna and Flora Uniyal Gaon is in the Shivaliks of Garhwal, perched at an altitude which makes it the home of several rare plants and animals. Leopards (or baagh) are common in the area and have played a key role in the lifestyle and folklore of the people. Though attacks on humans are rare and have dwindled considerably, cattle remains an easy source of food for the leopard. People have always relied on the forest for cattle-feed, firewood, freshwater and food and realize its importance as well as the impacts of mining it for natural resources. In 1999, Uniyalgaon was the subject of a case study on villagers' reactions to afforestation and natural resource regeneration. In 1996, it participated in the Doon Valley Watershed Management project to gauge the effectiveness of participatory approaches in sustainable management. Society Step farming and cattle herding provided a little but somehow allowed the villagers to sustain themselves. Poverty was high in the area, traditional and western education were realized to be the only way out of such conditions and special importance was placed on it, this enabled the farmers to also serve in and around the village as teachers, temple priests and Ayurvedic doctors. Barter system was prevalent for many years in the post-independence era and services could be traded for tobacco, salt, grain, cattle and pulses. Summer houses or chhyaani are commonly found around the village in areas located at a shaded location and were sometimes owned by two or more families. Most of such houses which are maintained to be kept in use are also rented out to tourists visiting Surkanda Devi. Like most traditional Indian villages, it consists of people from a common caste. Uniyal, which is a Hindu Garhwali brahmin caste, make up the entire population. Since the castes are further subdivided into gotras, Uniyals identify themselves as having the kashyap gotra. Bhairava is worshipped as the kuldevata or a community-deity, this is a common practice in Hindu villages.The literate people of uniyal goan had actively participated in the freedom movement of India, man like Jai Krishna Uniyal went lahore for getting higher studies and formed a social organisation \\"SUJAN BHANDHU\\" to organise the youth of their area and inculcicated the feeling of nationalism among them. The village has pride of many number of Freedom Fighters. Current The village consists of 13 households with a population of 64. The literacy rate is 71.4%. Over the past three decades, a majority of residents moved to nearby towns and cities which offered better job opportunities and a comfortable lifestyle. This was because of commencement of major industrial projects, a boost in tourism and the formation of the state of Uttarakhand. The sudden drain of population has caused the village to reach the brink of being deserted with many homes falling under neglect and abandonment. The few households that still remain depend on traditional farming methods and natural resources from the forests to get by. Several individuals from the village have made their way into key positions in the Government and private corporations. A temple was constructed with funding by the current inhabitants of the village and the ones who now reside in different places across the world. This initiative was undertaken to have a shrine, the exclusivity of which along with the religious events it will host would keep the villagers and the non-resident community bonded in a way.

Herbal viagra is a name that can be given to any herbal product advertised as treating erectile dysfunction. There are many different products advertised as herbal viagra, but with varying ingredients. There are no clinical trials or scientific studies that support the effectiveness of any of these ingredients for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and some products have been found to contain drugs and other adulterants, and have been the subject of FDA and FTC warnings and actions to remove them from the market. The name \\"herbal viagra\\" is taken from the brand name Viagra, under which drug company Pfizer sells sildenafil citrate, a drug that is used to treat erectile dysfunction. Viagra has become a generic term for many people discussing drugs designed to treat erectile dysfunction, even those which do not contain sildenafil. Herbal viagras, contrary to what the name suggests, do not normally contain sildenafil citrate. However, sildenafil and chemicals similar to sildenafil have been found as adulterants in many supplements which are sold as herbal viagra or \\"natural\\" sexual enhancement products. The United States Food and Drug Administration has warned consumers that any sexual enhancement product that claims to work as well as prescription products is likely to contain such a contaminant.Hidden Risks of Erectile Dysfunction \\"Treatments\\" Sold Online, United States Food and Drug Administration, February 21, 2009 Scientists estimated that >60% of the consumed sildenafil in the Netherlands is from illegal sources such as adulterated dietary supplements. Herbal viagras often carry a number of dangerous side effects. Primarily, they cause abnormally low blood pressure and can restrict blood flow to vital organs. There is also evidence to suggest some preparations may be toxic if taken in larger doses. Additional side effects and dangers of common herbal viagra adulterants, such as sulfoaildenafil, acetildenafil and other analogs, are unknown because these ingredients have not had thorough review in human clinical trials.

It was released alongside the album as its lead single in December 2003 by Warner Music Philippines. The song was written and produced by The 33rd, and features a rap verse performed by rapper Picasso. \\"Make You Mine\\" differed from the previous singles Nina was known for. Its upbeat groove and flirty lyrics allowed her to transcend the typical \\"love song syndrome\\" most Filipino artists are known for, and spun a reinvented image for the singer. The song talks about a girl who fell in love at first sight with a boy, and could not stop thinking about him and wants to make the boy hers. The song was praised by OPM critics and reviewers, who called the song \\"a blissful listening experience\\". It also stood out above other releases at that time, with its different sound and lyrics, allowing Nina to transcend the typical Filipino \\"love song syndrome\\". Commercially, the song was a surprise hit. \\"Make You Mine\\" was accompanied by a music video, where Nina is seen buying toys with her friends. She then crushes on a guy she sees at the toy store. Background =Development= After the success of Nina's 2002 debut album, Heaven, it was obligatory that she releases another record in the following year. Her debut was heavily influenced by jazzy lounge pop-R&B; similar to the sound of international music at that time. Warner Music kept the sound she started with and made it even bigger. While the re-release of Heaven was being sent out to the market, the label has already started production for her second album in 2003. The production was a bit rushed, since the album needed to be released before the year ended. Under Warner's managing head at that time, Ricky Ilacad, the label collaborated with more international songwriters, arrangers and producers for the second project. These include The 33rd, Cuban American composer-producer Rudy P√©rez, Zomba record-production acts Sean Hosein, Dane DeViller, Andy Goldmark and Swedish composer J√∂rgen Elofsson. The album resembles the same sound from its predecessor, but only bigger and bolder in terms of incorporating urban-style to upbeat rhythmic jams and harmonic sound to powerful sentimental ballads. =Release= \\"Make You Mine\\" was immediately released in December 2003 as a follow-up to Nina's string of hits. Critical and commercial response to both the song and the album were great especially, since the song differed from the previous singles Nina was known for. Its upbeat groove and flirty lyrics allowed Nina to transcend the typical \\"love song syndrome\\" most Filipino artists are known for, and spun a reinvented image for the Soul Siren. On June 21, 2005, the song was released on digital download through iTunes and Amazon.com MP3 Download. Composition \\"Make You Mine\\" is an uptempo song, that blends the sound of contemporary R&B; and hip-hop, with a touch of bubblegum pop. The song has a rich harmonic chemistry of Nina's mesmerizing vocals and hypnotic urban-style beats with a blend of funky strings. It is described as \\"an upbeat R&B; piece that offers a blissful listening experience.\\" It features a rap verse performed by Picasso. The song reinvented Nina's image, since it differed from her previous love-ballad releases. It showcases upbeat groove and flirty lyrics, that is heavily influenced by American urban music. Her whistle register on the song ranges from G6 to A6, and is performed repetitively throughout the bridge until it fades. Music video Nina holding a big teddy bear in the music video. The music video for \\"Make You Mine\\" was shot at Toy Kingdom. It features Nina and rapper Picasso in the toy store, where Nina is seen buying toys with a group of friends, when they spot a man she begins crushing on. Picasso enters the scene to rap as Nina sings the song. =Synopsis= The video starts off as Nina and her two girl friends are seen roaming around a toy store and trying on whatever toys they find. Nina wears a pink top and jeans, similar to Mariah Carey's wardrobe on \\"Heartbreaker\\" music video. A guy wearing a blue shirt is then shown. Nina later spots the guy, and started crushing on him. To get the guy's attention, she and her friends started dancing, playing around and hugging each other behind the boy, while he is looking for toys. A scene, where Nina's friends give her various stuff toys until she gets covered up by the toys, is then shown. Picasso later enters the scene, rapping while walking on the toy car segment of the store. Nina's friends are then shown giving her a toy car with remote control, and she directs the car until it bumps to the boy's feet. The three hide behind the toy cars, as the boy's looks behind him. Scenes where Nina sings to the song, while dancing are inserted into different parts of the video. Live performances In December 2003, Nina transferred from GMA to ABS-CBN. She signed a contract with musical variety TV show ASAP Mania and launched her album on the show, singing \\"Make You Mine\\". On January 30, 2004, she performed the song on her album launching at Greenbelt 3 Park, singing also other tracks in the album. Early in 2005, she returned to MYX Live! hosted by Rico Blanco.

It had four hinge mounted nozzles that gimbaled each on one axis to supply thrust vector control and was restart capable. It used cavitating flow venturis to regulate propellant flows. The gas generator also incorporated dual heat exchangers that heated hydrogen gas, and supplied helium from separate systems to pressurize the hydrogen and oxygen tanks. The engine was relatively underpowered for its task and the start up and restart procedures were unreliable. Thus, it was quickly replaced by the YF-75. History In October 1970 the Beijing Aerospace Propulsion Institute was tasked with developing a prototype rocket engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. They settled on a pump-fed gas generator design. The prototype was successfully fire tested for 20 seconds on January 25, 1975. In March of the same year, China officially initiated the Project 311 do initiate the engineering work on the first Chinese cryogenic engine, which was named YF-73.

The original building was constructed in 1840 as part of a worldwide research project run by Edward Sabine to determine the cause of fluctuations in magnetic declination. Measurements from the Toronto site demonstrated that sunspots were responsible for this effect on Earth's magnetic field. When this project concluded in 1853, the observatory was greatly expanded by the Canadian government and served as the country's primary meteorological station and official timekeeper for over fifty years. The observatory is considered the birthplace of Canadian astronomy. Sabine's study William Armstrong in 1852. Compasses tended to \\"wander\\" from north when measurements were taken at different locations or even at a single location over a period of time. The astronomer Edmund Halley noted this and the problems it would cause for navigation in 1701.Gurney, p. 27. It was also believed that whatever was causing this effect might be causing changes in the weather, and that studying magnetic variations might lead to better weather prediction.Thomas, The Toronto Observatory In 1833 the British Association for the Advancement of Science commissioned a series of magnetic measurements across the United Kingdom. Under the direction of Major Edward Sabine of the Royal Artillery, a multi-year measuring project began, with the results to be published in 1838.Thiessen, p. 309. As the measurements were being made a number of proposals were put forth to expand the program worldwide. In 1836 the German explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt wrote to Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, then President of the Royal Society, stating that a formal program was important to a nation with dominions spread across the globe. At the seventh meeting of the British Association in Liverpool in 1837, Sabine declared that \\"the magnetism of the earth cannot be counted less than one of the most important branches of the physical history of the planet we inhabit\\" and mapping its variations would be \\"regarded by our contemporaries and by posterity as a fitting enterprise of a maritime people; and a worthy achievement of a nation which has ever sought to rank foremost in every arduous undertaking\\".Qtd. in Thiessen, p. 308, from Report of the Seventh Meeting of the British Association of the Advancement of Science, 1838. In 1837, the British Government funded the installation of a magnetic observatory at Greenwich. The Association continued to press for the construction of similar observatories around the world, and in 1838 their suggestions were accepted by the Government and funds were provided. In 1839 the British Government and the Royal Society prepared four expeditions to build magnetic observation stations in Cape Town; St. Helena; Hobart, Tasmania and (eventually) Toronto, Ontario.Thiessen, p. 310. Teams of Royal Artillery officers were sent out to take the measurements. The team assigned to Canada originally planned to build their observatory on Saint Helen's Island off Montreal, but the local rocks proved to have a high magnetic influence, and the decision was made to move to Toronto instead.Thiessen, p. 312. The team arrived in 1839, and set up camp at Fort York in a disused barracks while construction started on new buildings. The observatory was given of land to the west of King's College; the Ontario Legislature now occupies the area on which the college was located.Thiessen, p. 331. The observatory, officially \\"Her Majesty's Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory at Toronto\\", was completed the following year. It consisted of two log buildings, one for the magnetic instruments and the other a smaller semi-buried building nearby for \\"experimental determinations\\". The north end of the main building was connected to a small conical dome which contained a theodolite used to make astronomical measurements for the accurate determination of the local time. The buildings were constructed with as little metal as possible; when metal was required, non-magnetic materials such as brass or copper were used. A small barracks was built nearby to house the crew. Using the measurements from the Toronto and Hobart sites, Sabine noticed both short-term fluctuations in magnetic declination over a period of hours, and longer-term variations over months. He quickly concluded that the short term variations were due to the day/night cycle, while the longer term ones were due to the number of visible sunspots. He published two introductory papers on the topic in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. The first, in 1851, was a collection of early measurements; the second in 1852 correlated with Heinrich Schwabe's sunspot measurements, which had been made widely available in Alexander von Humboldt's Cosmos, also published in 1851.Thomas With further data collected from the Toronto site, Sabine was able to demonstrate conclusively that the eleven-year sunspot cycle caused a similarly periodic variation in the Earth's magnetic field. He presented a third and conclusive paper on the topic in 1856, \\"On Periodical Laws Discoverable in the Mean Effects of the Larger Magnetic Disturbances\\", in which he singled out the Toronto site for particular praise.Sabine Sir John Henry Lefroy, a pioneer in the study of terrestrial magnetism served as director of the magnetic observatory from 1842 to 1853; In 1960, the Ontario Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Citizenship and Culture erected a Provincial Military Plaque in his honour on the University of Toronto campus. Ontario Heritage Foundation plaque , National Defence, Canada Meteorological service The newer observatory before it was moved, looking towards the southwest. This image is the same orientation as the one below, viewed from the left of the tower. The observatory in 2009, looking east-southeast. Offices on the ground floor have been rotated; the entrance was formerly to the right of the tower. In 1853 the Royal Society's project was concluded, and the observatory was set to be abandoned. After a lengthy debate, the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation. Rather than disappearing like its three counterparts, the Toronto observatory was upgraded, and its mission was expanded as it became a meteorological station (see Meteorological Service of Canada) under the direction of the Ministry of Marine and Fisheries. During the expansion, the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure.Beattie, p. 109. The new building was designed in 1853 by local architect Frederick Cumberland, who was also working on the design of University College, which was being built just north of the Observatory to replace King's College. The new observatory design called for a stone building, with an attached tower containing the theodolite. The new building was completed in 1855, and stood directly opposite the entrance of today's Convocation Hall. During its time as a meteorological station, the observatory collected reports from 312 observation stations in Canada and another 36 in the United States. Each station was equipped with a \\"Mercurial Barometer, two Thermometers (a maximum and a minimum Thermometer), an Anemometer to measure the velocity of the wind, a Wind Vane and a Rain Gauge\\". Reports were sent in coded form to the Observatory at 8 am and 8 pm every day, Eastern Standard Time (then known as \\"75th meridian time\\"), and used to produce a chart predicting the weather for the following 36 hours. These predictions were then telegraphed across the country, and charts were distributed to newspapers and the Board of Trade, where they could be viewed by the public. With the installation of telephones, the Observatory also offered weather reports on demand, which was an important service to fruit vendors, who used the reports to plan shipping. Among its other uses, in 1880, measurements from the site were used as part of the effort to develop standard time. The observatory remained the official timekeeper for Canada until 1905, when that responsibility was transferred to Ottawa's Dominion Observatory. At exactly 11:55 am the clocks in Toronto fire halls were rung by an electrical signal from the Observatory.Hodgins In 1881 the observatory's director, Charles Carpmeal, suggested adding a high-quality telescope to the observatory. He felt that direct solar observations would lead to a better understanding of sunspot effects on weather (as late as 1910 the observatory's then-director, R. F. Stupart, noted that \\"sun spots have more to do with our weather conditions than have the rings around the moon.\\"). Coincidentally, the Canadian government (having formed in 1867) was interested in taking part in the major international effort to accurately record the December 1882 Transit of Venus. Funds were provided for the purchase of a 6-inch (150 mm) refracting telescope from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable to take part in the transit measurements due to bad weather,Beattie, p. 117. and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.Beattie, p. 115. Relocation The observatory viewed looking north-northeast, with Hart House in the background. The rotation of the tower is more obvious here: compare the location of the windows with the images above. By the 1890s, the observatory had become crowded by the rapidly growing university. Electrification of the tramways along College Street just to the south, and the large quantities of metal used in the modern buildings surrounding the site threw off the instruments. A new magnetic observatory opened in 1898 in Agincourt, at that time largely empty fields, (found on later maps on the north end of George Forfar farm east of Midland Avenue near Highway 401 or where Health Canada Protection Branch building resides todayhttp://maps.library.utoronto.ca/datapub/digital/YorkScarboro.jpg) leaving the downtown campus location with its meteorological and solar observation duties.In turn, in 1968 the Agincourt observatory was replaced by one in Ottawa. See By 1907, new university buildings completely surrounded the observatory; dust from the construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and move to a new building at the north end of campus at 315 Bloor Street West, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land.Beattie, p. 118. There was some discussion regarding what to do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory. The university assumed ownership of the now-disused observatory building and was originally going to abandon it. Louis Beaufort Stewart, a lecturer in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, campaigned for it to be saved for the Department of Surveying and Geodesy. He eventually arranged for the building to be re-constructed on a more suitable site. Demolition work was carried out in 1907: the stones were simply left in place over the winter, and were used the following year to construct a re-arranged building just east of the main University College building (south of Hart House).Faught In 1930 the Meteorological Office no longer used the Cooke telescope, and agreed to donate it to the university if they would handle its removal. Both the telescope and the observatory dome were moved to the observatory building.Beattie, p. 123. The telescope moved once again in 1952 to the David Dunlap Observatory north of the city, and in 1984 it was donated to the Canada Science and Technology Museum. The Department of Surveying and Geodesy used the observatory until the 1950s. Since then the office areas have been used for a variety of purposes, including a police substation and a telephone switchboard. Renamed as the Louis Beaufort Stewart Observatory, the building was handed over to the Students' Administrative Council (now University of Toronto Students' Union) in 1953, which has used the building since then. The dome, now unused, receives a yearly multi-colour paint job by engineering students. Heritage The property is listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register since 1973. The listing notes it was opened as an observatory in 1857, designed by Cumberland and Storm.

It is a survivor from the Gothic Revival of the nineteenth century: a firm founded in 1874 by three leading late-Victorian church architects ‚Äì George Frederick Bodley, Thomas Garner and Gilbert Scott the younger ‚Äì to produce furniture, textiles, stained glass windows, and needlework in a style distinctively their own. History The partners were all pupils of Sir George Gilbert Scott, whose work includes the Albert Memorial, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the St Pancras Hotel, St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, many churches, cathedral restorations and country houses. The motivating force was Bodley, himself one of the most scholarly, fastidious and refined architects of his generation, a designer not only of such churches as the Church of the Holy Angels, Hoar Cross, Staffordshire, and, with his first pupil Henry Vaughan, of the National Cathedral of Ss Peter & Paul, Washington DC, but also of country houses and the restorations of castles and bishops‚Äô palaces. In 1868 Bodley formed a partnership with one of the most brilliant pupils in Scott's office, Thomas Garner. Unable to find firms to carry out furnishings and wallpaper to their satisfaction they established two companies: Burlison and Grylls and Watts & Co. The former, under the aegis of Garner, produced stained glass and painted decoration for furniture, roofs and walls. The second, founded in associations with Sir Gilbert's elder son, provided embroidery, textiles, wallpaper, domestic furniture, and metalwork. Bodley was the first chairman. The designs made by the founders for the firm were among the most original and distinctive of their time, rivalled only the work of Morris & Co., with whom Watts was in friendly competition. All three were captivated by the ethereal beauty of the late‚Äìgothic art of Northern Europe and the sturdy refinement of the English Renaissance House. Both were their inspiration and from such rich sources they produced designs of fertile invention in which the elaboration of detail is controlled by simplicity, strength and restraint, giving their work a timeless quality transcending period limitation. Although Watt's designs were primarily for use in the partners‚Äô own work they have always been sold commercially and have been used extensively by many leading architects and designers, Bodley's pupil, Sir Ninian Comper, used their fabrics in his early work and in restorations after the Second World War. Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, Temple Moore and Sir Walter Tapper used Watts exclusively: the American architect, Ralph Adams Cram, imported Watt's fabrics for many of his noble churches. Recent history In recent years, Robert Maguire and Keith Murray broke new ground with their pioneering Church of St Paul, Bow Common, for which Watts executed the contemporary fittings. The work of Stephen Dykes Bower, in Westminster Abbey, Bury St Edmunds Cathedral and elsewhere, is inextricably associated with Watt's textiles and embroidery. The great country house architects, Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Robert Lorimer, used their wallpapers in their classic interiors; while Lutyens used Watts fabric for upholstering the viceregal thrones in Government House, New Delhi. Watts wallpapers and textiles were designed for distinguished settings. Still in production, they have in recent years been used extensively in restoration work by the National Trust, in the Houses of Parliament, in colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, and by architects and decorators involved in the conservation of historic buildings. So excellent are the designs in themselves that they have continued to be used privately in houses old and new. From the firm's foundation church embroidery has been in the forefront of their work. Numberless altar frontals, banners, hangings and vestments are found in cathedrals, churches, and chapels throughout the world. Watts are still renowned for their high standard of embroidery and needlework, specialising in traditional methods. In 1986, in recognition of their work, the firm was honoured with a Royal Warrant, appointing them ecclesiastical furnishers to Queen Elizabeth II. Watts has always been a family firm. Bodley was an uncle of George Gilbert Scott the Younger. From 1951, until her death in 2001, Elizabeth Hoare, a granddaughter of George Scott the Younger and great-grand niece of Bodley, was the firm's Director. Today, her children and now grandchildren continue the business.

The flowers are having four to six white petals, the flowers are located in subterminal leaf axils. It blooms from May to June. The fruits are globular and red holly. Fruits spherical, about 1 cm wide, fleshy, red and located on stems of 3‚Äì8 mm long. There are two subspecies. In the ssp. azevinho (Sol. ex Lowe, Kunkel) the berries may reach 2 cm. Ecology Ilex canariensis is a plant in the family Aquifoliaceae related to European holly, endemic to Madeira and the Canary Islands. It has two subspecies both of them having the trunk clear with white and brown spots. It reproduces by seeds and shoots. Ilex canariensis needs high humidity and relatively stable and mild temperature. It is threatened by habitat loss. The species is found mainly at lower altitudes in scrub and laurisilva where moisture in the air condenses or at the bottom of the ravines or near wet areas. Laurisilva may be increasing in Madeira, but throughout much of the range there are pressures, particularly from sheep and goats grazing and fires. This endemism has lost almost all the spines present on the edge of the leaves of the European holly, certainly due to the lack of pressure from herbivores that did not exist in these islands until the introduction of cattle by humans. The Laurel forest of Laurisilva is a subtropical forest, found in areas with high humidity and relatively stable and mild temperatures. The macaronesian laurissilva is an endemic ecoregion from Macaronesia with many endemic laurifolia trees of what Ilex canariensis is one of them, endemic to the island of Madeira and the Canary Islands.

It opened about 1858 and closed in the 1930s. Overview From the 12th century, the Swanage area was well known for the quarrying of Purbeck Marble, actually a hard wearing form of limestone. Much of this was shipped out through Swanage, originally being loaded into small vessels from horse carts driven into the waters of Swanage Bay. In 1858 a pier, now known as the Old Pier, was built in deeper water and linked to the stone stores on the waterfront by a horse-drawn tramway. The line survived in use until the 1930s, latterly being used to carry fish from the pier to a fish store built alongside the line around 1855. Track gauge Existing evidence on the ground shows that the tramway was of narrow gauge, although it was originally standard gauge. The tramway was re-gauged prior to the opening of the public pier. There is little evidence that mechanical traction was ever used on the line. The site today About of track still exist, embedded in the footway that links the centre of Swanage with the later built Steamer Pier. The timber supports of the Old Pier also still exist, albeit in a derelict condition. LSWR line The Swanage Pier Tramway should not be confused with a standard gauge tramway opened by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) as an extension of one of the sidings at Swanage railway station. This connected to a stone store in the same vicinity of those served by the pier tramway, but the two lines were never connected.

Like the 1934 American film Father Brown, Detective, it is based loosely on \\"The Blue Cross\\" (1910), the first Father Brown short story by G. K. Chesterton. Plot The police raid a premises at night and find a priest at an open safe: he explains he is replacing the money for a parishioner. He is arrested and put in the cells but released when the bishop confirms who he is. Outside he meets the erring parishioner Bert (Sid James) and convinces him to be a chauffeur to Lady Warren rather than drive get-away cars. He is chosen to go to Rome carrying a 1200 year old priceless crucifix. He is aware that his rival, the arch criminal Flambeau, may try to steal the cross. He sails to France then catches a train. The first stop is Paris. He is accompanied by a priest he met on the ship. As they sit in a cafe they are aware that two policemen are watching. They wait until there are only two seats left on an excursion bus then grab it, leaving the police stranded. The two police get a lift in the back of a police van with a group of prostitutes. The excursion goes to the catacombs. There they separate from the group. Father Brown has worked out that the priest is Flambeau as he ordered a ham sandwich (on a Friday). Nevertheless Flambeau overpowers him and steals the cross, leaving Brown tied against a pile of bones. Flambeau changes disguise and gets past the two police who wait at the entrance. Father Brown convinces his friend, Lady Warren, to auction an important gold chess set to lure Flambeau into stealing it. They expect him to appear in disguise at the auction. He does, but not as a bidder: Flambeau is the porter who carries the set out of the room after bidding concludes. But Flambeau returns the set to Lady Warren to prove a point. When the police arrive at the door Flambeau and Brown remove all the milk from the back of a milk van to make it look as if they needed the space. This diversion makes the police follow the van and Brown and Flambeau escape. Brown starts researching Flambeau in the library (breaking his glasses in this task) and finds a link to Fleurency in the Burgundy region of France. He then goes there. At a wine festival he finds Flambeau but Flambeau slips away. The next day he finds the old chateau and asks for \\"the duke\\". He is told he is not home. He slips into the inner courtyard disguised as an old woman on a cart of grapes. On entering the chateau he finds signs of habitation but the chateau is ruinous. He discovers a secret door in the back of the big kitchen fireplace and Flambeau asks him to enter. Inside he has a priceless art collection. He gives Brown the stolen cross. The police arrive and Flambeau flees through the window. His art collection is retrieved by the police and displayed in the Louvre. Back in England Father Brown gives a sermon on the prodigal son. Flambeau enters and sits next to Lady Warren. Cast Adaptation It is based on G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown character and was directed by Robert Hamer. The screenplay adaptation is based loosely on the Father Brown story, \\"The Blue Cross\\". Although credited to Thelma Schnee and Hamer, it was actually co-written by Schnee and blacklisted screenwriter Maurice Rapf. Critical reception Variety said the film was, \\"distinguished mainly by the excellent casting of Alec Guinness in the title role\\".

Early history Backer was born in Stamford, Connecticut, to Henry Jacob Backer, Jr., and Catherine (n√©e Lagana) Backer. He attended public schools in Norwalk, Connecticut, and later earned a license as a Merchant Marine Officer from the United States Coast Guard Examining Unit at New York City. Backer received an Arborist license from the Connecticut Tree Examining Board,Connecticut Tree Protective Association website, ctpa.org; accessed December 18, 2015. certifying him as an expert in the care of trees. Backer is a third generation fisherman and engaged in lobster and shell fishing with his father in the Long Island Sound for many years. Political career Terry Backer was first elected as \\"Terrance E. Backer\\" to represent the 121st Connecticut General Assembly District of the Connecticut House of Representatives, located in Stratford, Connecticut, on November 3, 1992, defeating Kevin C. Kelly 4,470 votes to 3,981. He was re-elected on November 4, 2014 and served continuously until his death during his 12th term on December 14, 2015 . \\"Backer ... served in numerous positions in the legislature, including; Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Chairman of the Energy and Technology Committee, Assistant Majority Leader and Assistant Majority Whip. Backer has also held the position of House Chairman of the Appropriation subcommittee on Conservation and Development.\\" He held the position in the Connecticut General Assembly of House Chairman of the Appropriation Subcommittee on Conservation and Development. He chaired the subcommittee from 1993 to 2008 and again for the 2009-10 term. The subcommittee is tasked with crafting the budget for the Department of Environmental Protection, the state Labor Department, the Department of Economic Development and Housing and the Culture and the Tourism Board and the Department of Agriculture, as well as other state agencies. During his tenure as Chairman of the Energy and Technology Committee (2002‚Äì2003), Backer, oversaw and wrote the cleanup legislation to the State of Connecticut's 1998 Electric Deregulation and Restructuring law. He added improvements to the environmental and renewable energy components to the law. Backer expanded the Renewable Portfolio Standards,Renewable Portfolio Standards, ct.gov; accessed December 16, 2015. created Project 100, a renewable energy program design to implement renewable generation in the state, and passed the Energy Efficiency Standards of Commercial Appliances bill. Backer's Committee assignments for the 2009-10 legislative session were the Appropriations Committee, the Environment Committee and the Energy and Technology Committee. Backer focused his activities in the Environment Committee on water quality improvements and reduction of pollution from storm water. His activities in the Energy and Technology Committee have focused on renewable energy and energy security with a special interest in Peak oil concerns. House Speaker for the 2009-10 legislative session, Chris Donovan (D-Meriden) appointed Representative Backer to chair a newly created sub- committee on Clean Energy and Energy Efficiency. In February 2005, while serving as vice chairman of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Energy Committee, Backer wrote an article for State Legislatures Magazine, a publication of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), titled Freedom From Fossil Fuel. In the article, he criticized the federal government and past administrations for their failure to prepare the nation's infrastructure for a contraction of the conventional fossil fuel supply and the resulting impact on the nation. He also proposed that the states take the lead rather than relying on Congress or the administration. In July 2007, Backer and State Rep. Bob Duff co-founded the Connecticut General Assembly's Peak Oil and Natural Gas Caucus. The Caucus was formed to investigate the status of world petroleum based fuel supply, the impact of escalating cost on the society and the economy, and post carbon fuel implications for the current government planning process. Originally appearing in the Norwalk Hour. In November 2007, the Legislative Peak Oil and Natural Gas Caucus, with Backer as the lead author, released a report to the Connecticut General Assembly and the Governor titled \\"Peak Oil Production and the Implications to the State of Connecticut.\\" The report was an outgrowth of the work of the caucus Backer and Duff co-founded earlier that year. The report was the first of its kind to state legislatures. During the 2008 legislative session, Representative Backer authored the Energy Scarcity and Security Act which was passed into law. The act begins a scenario planning process and establishes two functions. A report and study on energy concerns and the formation of a task force. The Energy Scarcity and Security Task Force was formed to make recommendation regarding the findings of a report that will investigate the impact of rising energy cost and both major and short term supply disruptions on the state's ability to provide services and the impact on the state's economy and cost to citizens. He was appointed as co-chair of the task force, along with Senator Bob Duff of Norwalk, Connecticut, who was appointed by the President Pro Temp of the Senate. In September 2008, Backer received the Congressman Roscoe Bartlett Speaking Truth to Power award from the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas (ASPO-USA). The award was given at Sacramento, California during the ASPO-USA annual meeting. Representative Backer was awarded the honor for his work on two landmark reports to the Connecticut legislature and the state's Governor regarding diminishing flows of oil due to resource depletion and geopolitical problems facing global oil production. The reports focused on global conditions and addressed impending cost and availability, as well as, potential shortages to the state. Backer died during his 12th term as State Representative on December 14, 2015, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, from complications related to the treatment of brain cancer. Background =Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association= Terry Backer, lobstering on Long Island Sound 1990 In 1984, after witnessing degrading water quality in Long Island Sound, Backer, along with Chris Staplefelt, another local fisherman, co-founded the Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association. The fishermen's association was modeled after the Hudson River Fishermen's Association based in Garrison, New York. Staplefelt and Backer had been buying Buck Shad in the spring of the year for lobster bait from Bob Gabrielson, a Nyack, New York, shad fisherman. After hearing complaints of continued pollution problems in Long Island Sound, Gabrielson, introduced Backer and Staplefelt to John Cronin, then the Hudson Riverkeeper, who with the help of the New York City based law firm of Berle, Kass and Case, now dissolved, established the Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association. Once established, Backer, Cronin and Staplefelt laid out an aggressive plan to track down municipal and corporate polluters of the Sound, and bring them to court to abate the pollution of the Sound. Backer became the group's president, investigator and public point man. The Fishermen's Association, under Backer, brought federal Clean Water Act lawsuits against several Connecticut municipalities for violations of their National Pollution Discharge Elimination Systems Permits. The suits included; Norwalk, Bridgeport, Stratford and Milford, as well as other cities in Connecticut. The Fishermen's Association's set the tone for the hard nosed legal defense of the Long Island Sound. Backer would later bring these tactics to the role of Soundkeeper. =Soundkeeper= Terry Backer (2006) In 1987 Backer founded, along with John Cronin, the Hudson Riverkeeper and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Chief Attorney for the Hudson Riverkeeper the Long Island Soundkeeper Fund Inc. That same year, Backer became the first Soundkeeper for Long Island Sound and executive director of the not for profit environmental protection organization based in Norwalk, Connecticut.Office of the Connecticut Secretary of State, Commercial Filings Unit, Hartford, Connecticut, concord-sots.ct.gov; accessed December 16, 2015.

It is China's second generation of cryogenic propellant engine, after the YF-73, which it replaced. It is used in a dual engine mount in the H-18 third stage of the Long March 3A, Long March 3B and Long March 3C launch vehicles. Within the mount, each engine can gimbal individually to enable thrust vectoring control. The engine also heats hydrogen and helium to pressurize the stage tanks and can control the mixture ratio to optimize propellant consumption. Development Given the upward trend on geosynchronous communication satellite's mass and size, a program to develop an engine more powerful than the YF-73 was started by 1982. The proper development of the engine started in 1986 and leveraged the experience of the YF-73. It flew for the first time in 1994. By September 2013, it had accumulated 12 start up and 3,000 seconds of firing time without malfunction. By 2006 and with the project for the Long March 5 family a serious redesign program was started. The resulting engine, the YF-75D is a different engine, using a closed circuit expander cycle like the RL10. Technical Description The combustion chamber regeneratively cooled and is made of a zirconium copper alloy. It is manufactured by forging, rolled into shape, and then the cooling channels are milled. The outer wall is electroformed nickel. The nozzle extension uses dump cooling. It is made by welding spiraling tubes which pass cryogenic hydrogen that is dumped since the tubes are open at the bottom. The gas generator feed separate turbopumps for fuel and oxidizer. The single shaft hydrogen turbopump operates at 42,000rpm and uses dual elastic supports to enhance the rotor stability and reliability. The gas generator also incorporates dual heat exchanger that heat hydrogen gas and helium supplied from separate system to pressurize the hydrogen and oxygen tanks. The turbopumps use solid propellant cartridge for start up, while the gas generator and combustion chamber use pyrotechnic igniter. It can restart for two burn profile missions. All subsystems are attached to the combustion chamber and gimbal is achieved by rotating the whole engine on two orthogonal planes with two independent actuators. These actuators use high pressure hydrogen as hydraulic fluid. The oxygen supply system has a propellant utilization valve before the main LOX valve to regulate its flow and thus variate the mixture ratio. This enables optimization of the propellant reserves and improves performance.

Subsequently he was an accountant, and in 1900 qualified as a solicitor. He had become interested in the land taxation proposals of Henry George in 1890 and was prominent in the beginnings of the New South Wales Labor Party. Beeby worked as a journalist for a while and then began practising as a solicitor. The 1901 arbitration act brought him much business; it was stated in 1906 that his firm had been concerned in two hundred disputes. In January 1907 Beeby stood as a Labor candidate for Blayney at a by-election due to the resignation of W. P. (Paddy) Crick, but Beeby was defeated by 23 votes. Parliamentary career Beeby won the seat of Blayney for the Labor Party at the 1907 state election, and with William Holman was successful in considerably modifying the amending industrial disputes bill brought in by Charles Wade. When James McGowen formed the first New South Wales Labor ministry in October 1910, Beeby was his minister of public instruction and of labour and industry until 11 September 1911 when he became minister for public works until December 1912. He had, however, come to the conclusion that the time had arrived for the formation of a party which would include the moderates of all parties. He resigned from the Labor Party and parliament in December 1912, and was re-elected for Blayney as an independent on 23 January 1913. Prior to the 1913 state election, he created the National Progressive Party and ran a slate of 10 candidates. Only he polled over 10 percent of the vote, winning 19.5 percent in the seat of Waverley. His voters helped elected a Labor candidate in the second round. He subsequently announced that his party had failed and there was no room for a third party in New South Wales. Beeby had been called to the bar in 1911 and now worked up a successful practice as a barrister. When Holman formed his national ministry in November 1916 Beeby became minister for labour and industry with a seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council. In 1918 Beeby, who had in the meanwhile been elected to the assembly for Wagga Wagga, succeeded in passing an industrial arbitration amendment act though it was strongly opposed by the Labour party. Towards the end of 1918 he visited Britain and the United States and, shortly after his return in June 1919, resigned from the government as a protest against administrative acts in connexion with the sale of wheat and the allotting of coal contracts. In March 1920, with the introduction of proportional representation, he was elected as the member for Murray. Judge Beeby walking in Sydney in 1927 In August 1920, Beeby resigned from parliament to be appointed a judge of the New South Wales arbitration court. In 1928 he became a member of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration bench. In the same year Beeby imposed an award favourable to the Federal Government's industrial policy which the Waterside Workers' Federation rejected. This resulted in strike action and later violence. Beeby was appointed chief judge in March 1939 and was knighted in the same year. Late life and family Beeby retired in 1941 and died on 18 July 1942. He married in 1892 and was survived by his wife, a son and three daughters. One daughter, Doris Isobel Beeby (1894‚Äì1948), was a communist party member and sought higher women's wages. His son, Edward Augustus (1892‚Äì1984), was (among other things) a musician and playwright. Edward opened the Patch Theatre Company in Perth WA in 1939. Publications Beeby was the author of Three Years of Industrial Arbitration in New South Wales (1906), a pamphlet; Concerning Ordinary People (1923), a volume of readable plays; In Quest of Pan (1924), a satire in verse on some of the Australian poets of the period; and A Loaded Legacy, a light novel which appeared in 1930. =Works= * Dregs * In Quest of Pan * One Touch O' Nature * Potter and Clay * Still Waters * The Banner * The Creative Urge * The Point of View * Merely Margaret Notes References Additional sources listed by the Dictionary of Australian Biography: H.

It was a derivative of the Ca.101. Design and development A robust and simple aircraft, it was meant to be used in harsh conditions with minimal support. It was designed by the engineer Rodolfo Verduzio of Gianni Caproni in 1931, and first flew in February 1932 as MM 205. This aircraft was a high-wing monoplane, built with a robust but simple structure consisting of a tubular steel skeleton with a fabric and wood skin. Derived from the earlier Ca.101, it used a different engine. The fuselage was of square section, and the wing was practically rectangular, with the extremities sloped and the ailerons running the whole length of the trailing edge. Steel tubing was also used for the undercarriage. This was fixed and had a complex structure that had two legs supported by several steel tubes between the fuselage and the wings. The crew consisted of three men. The pilot, a co-pilot/observer and a flight engineer/gunner. The main innovation was the engine. While the previous Ca.101 had three units, the newer type had only one. This was a risk because the engines of the time were not very reliable. It seems that the gamble paid off as the Ca.111 was faster than the three-engine Ca.101 and even the Ca.133. The engine was a water-cooled Isotta Fraschini Asso 750RC 18-cylinder in a 'W' layout. The first examples were equipped with a four-blade wooden propeller. Later models were fitted with a three-blade metal propeller with variable pitch. The required pitch had to be set on the ground and was not variable in flight. It was heavier and more expensive but provided a worthwhile improvement. Fuel capacity was 1,960 L (446 US gal) in two tanks, one of 1,060 L (280 US gal) and two of 450 L (116 US gal). Range was 2,000 km (1,240 mi). The oil tank was below the engine and contained 150 L (40 US gal). Maximum payload was 2,000 kg (4,410 lb), but if necessary could be raised to 2,500-2,800 kg (5,510-6,170 lb). The cockpit instruments were repeated for each pilot. The instrument panel included a 'Pezzoni' compass, a 'Sonia' aerometer, a variometer, 'OMI' altimeters and fire detectors with extinguisher controls. The canopy was detachable to allow for exit in an emergency. There was also a rice-transmitter radio, for the wireless-operator/gunner. This consisted of a RE 350 and AR 5 transmitter- receiver. This allowed both telegraphic and voice transmissions. To make this possible, there were two radio antennas: one fixed, one flexible. There were two accumulators and two air-generators. Finally, there was a photographic, photoplanimetric O.M.I. 13x18 camera, or an OMI APR 3 panoramic. Sometimes, a cine-machine-gun was also fitted. Defensive armament varied between three and six 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns. Initially, the armament was quite weak, one 7.7 mm (.303 in) Lewis Gun in the dorsal position, and one in each beam position. This was a serious failing as the gunner could only man one weapon at a time. One improvement was the replacement of the single dorsal gun by a turret fitted with two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Bredas. Another machine gun was sometimes fitted in the ventral position, both for offensive and defensive tasks. Some examples also had a machine gun fixed in the nose, firing with a synchronizer through the propeller disk. Bombload, theoretically was up to 600 kg (1,320 lb), in practice, it was more. This load was held vertically inside the fuselage, and consisted of two launchers for: *6 √ó 100 kg/220 lb (total practical, 780 kg/1,720 lb) *6 √ó 50 kg/110 lb (total practical, 420 kg/930 lb) *6 √ó 24, 20, 15, 12, 10 kg (50, 40, 33, 26, 20 lb). Up to 15 √ó 12 kg (26 lb), 15 kg (33 lb) or 24 kg (50 lb) bombs could be carried in a third launcher. It was also possible to carry two bombs of 250 kg (550 lb) or 500 kg (1,100 lb) or incendiaries (144 √ó 1 kg/2 lb and 144 √ó 2 kg/4 lb). Finally, chemical bombs could also be dropped. The door for entry into the aircraft was on the left- hand side. A civil version was built with seven seats. The Caproni Ca.140 was, instead, a retractable version of the basic project, but remained prototype. Another prototype was a version with a 3,000 km (1,860 mi) range, but the redesigned Ca.112 was not put into production. Its most notable difference was a new elliptic and enlarged wing. One example had a 746 kW (1,000 hp) A.80 engine. Caproni Ca.111Idro floatplane Possibly the most important version was the seaplane, fitted with two floats under the belly. It had been tested in 1932 and was called the Ca.111 Idro. The Idro version was the first to enter service. It was almost identical to the land version, but weighed 3,500 kg (7,720 lb) and had a 2,000 kg (4,410 lb) payload. The two floats were made of cedarwood. The engine remained the same but with 1,940 L (510 US gal) of fuel. Range was greater, but speed was reduced. Defensive weapons were four 7.7 mm (.303 in) Lewis guns with 2,000 cartridges each. Bombload was similar to that shown above. An 800 kg (1,760 lb) torpedo could also be carried. Operational history =Italy= The first examples were used by 146 and 183 Squadriglia, 85¬∞ Gruppo, to perform maritime reconnaissance, followed by the 142. They had six machines each. After just a year, these machines were replaced by CANT Z.501s. The aircraft were not scrapped but converted for land use, complete with undercarriage. Over 100 machines were rebuilt between 1934 and 1936. 25 were Idro versions. The Ca.111 was used as a long-range work-horse by the Regia Aeronautica. Its main employment was in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. This aircraft was, like all other machines, sent to the Ethiopian theatre by sea. The aircraft performed a variety of tasks, such as long-range reconnaissance, ground attack, bombing, and as a refuelling machine. It was even used to drop live animals to the troops. The aircraft was well suited to this kind of environment. It was relatively simple to maintain and could often be repaired with local materials. In this theatre, it was second only to the SM.81, which was much more sophisticated. On the whole, this machine was cheap, robust and reliable. It had good performance and could be armed with a variety of ordnance. It was also highly vulnerable and so was not deployed to places like Spain. Nevertheless, the machine served until the early 1940s, when it was replaced as a reconnaissance aircraft by the Cant Z.501 and the Ro.37. It was then used in the photoplannimetric role and as a supplier of isolated troops, this time in the Balkans, after the 'conquest' of Yugoslavia. =Peru= Peru took delivery of a number of Ca.111s in the 1930s which they nicknamed Panchos for use as \\"heavy\\" bombers, but found them unsatisfactory in service and by 1935 had begun to consider replacing them. In 1936, Peru ordered Caproni Ca.135 bombers‚Äîwhich entered Peruvian Air Force service in 1937‚Äîas replacements for its Ca.111s. However, Peru never procured enough Ca.135s to replace its Ca.111s; Ca.111s served in Peruvian Air Force heavy bomber squadrons alongside the new Ca.135s until 1940, when all Peruvian Ca.111s were reassigned for use as transport aircraft.The Latin American Aviation Historical Society: South American Aviation: \\"The Caproni Bergamaschi Ca.135 in Peruvian Service\\" by Amaru Tincopa Gallegos. Peru which had a small unit of paratroopers trained by Italy, during the Zarumilla War of 1941 dropped a small number of paratroopers from Ca. 111 R.C. aircraft on 27 July to seize the river port of Port Bolivar in disputed territory. This was the first combat use of paratroopers in South American or North America's military history.

Studies have looked at the predictors of breakups, the breakup process, the strategies employed, the impact of the breakups, and finally the process to move on emotionally from the broken relationship. Definition Relationship dissolution \\"refers to the process of the breaking up of relationships (friendship, romantic, or marital relationships) by the voluntary activity of at least one partner.\\" This article examines two types of relationship dissolution, the non-marital breakup and the marital breakup. The differences are how they are experienced, how they must be studied and how they might survive. Nonmarital breakups help us understand the nature of the issues involved and the patterns of grief experienced, they are meaningful to both persons, creating crisis in intimacy, personal and social development and future commitment expectations. Surviving a nonmarital breakup provides the opportunity to self-discovery, generosity, dignity and nobility of grief, and the promise of recovery (Weber, 1992). In marital breakups, more negotiation and delayed dissolution may occur because of the presence of children (Johnson, 1982) called a barrier force. Not all breakups should be considered a \\"failure\\", because they didn't last long enough or hit yearly marks as dictated by society. Some breakups may serve a distinct, positive change for one of the partners if there is abuse or other negative factors in the relationship. Breakup factors No relationship is established with the thought that it will end with heartache and grief, at least experienced by one of the couple. Why do we bother if the common belief is that at least 50% or more marriages end in divorce? Jones & Burdette, 1994, state in their work that we face two daunting risks when we pursue an intimate relationship with another: rejection and betrayal. This is countered with our social need to belong which usually trumps the risks. Hill, Rubin, and Peplau conducted a study in 1976 where 231 heterosexual couples agreed to complete a questionnaire about their relationship for two years. Only 128 couples survived the two years together, but it was the information gathered from the 103 couples that provided substantial information on breakup factors. =Predictors= * Dissimilarity among the couples in age, education, and physical attraction * Those who said they \\"loved\\" each other stayed together compared to those who simply \\"liked\\" each other =Process= Hill et al. (1976) found that the peak season for a breakup is when there are changes in one's life, which may force the relationship to be examined as to whether it can be sustained over time, distance, or other change in lifestyle. Women were more likely to be the initiators of change. =Impact= * Men were hit harder by the breakup than the women in the Hill et al. study (1976), they felt more depressed, lonely, unhappy, less free‚Äîbut less guilty * Women were less clingy and sentimental, and more pragmatic about the future of the relationship and how it would impact their lives‚Äîthey had more at stake in finding the right partner Duck's topographical model Steve Duck (1981) developed a topographical model of relationship disengagement and dissolution, whether married or not, in which he outlined four models of dissolution: pre-existing doom, mechanical failure, process loss and sudden death. =Pre-existing doom= * Couples who are badly matched from the start, no matter what the initiation action involved, it could not overcome personal differences =Mechanical failure= * When things break, where communication may be poor or interactions go badly. Without communication a relationship will never survive. =Process loss= * Relationships that die because they do not reach their potential, albeit a slow death, because of poor productivity or communication on one or both of the members of the dyad =Sudden death= New information on a partner can produce sudden death of the new relationship with a trust violation. Davis (1973) described three conditions that produce \\"sudden death\\" in a relationship: two-sided subsidence, in which both members of the couple maintain a formal relationship with no intimacy; one-sided subsidence, where one partner is dependent and hangs on, while the other actively seeks to end the relationship; and zero-sided subsidence which is an abrupt ending primarily brought on by outside factors that makes retreat or repair impossible. Breakup strategies There are at least fifteen strategies used to terminate relationships and are set apart by whether they are unilateral or bilateral and indirect or direct (Baxter, 1982, 1984). =Unilateral and indirect= * Withdrawal of supportiveness and affection * Pseudo de-escalation ‚Äì purports that the relationship will benefit by separation * Cost escalation ‚Äì attempts to make the relationship unattractive to the partner * Relational ruses ‚Äì leaking an impending breakup to a friend or third party * Avoidance behaviorsAvoidance ‚Äì from complete evasion to decreased contact =Unilateral and direct= * The direct dump ‚Äì simple statement that the relationship is over * Dates with other people * Justification ‚Äì explanation why the relationship is ending * The relationship talk trick ‚Äì talking about \\"problems\\" * Threats and bullying * Positive tone ‚Äì painting the picture that \\"it's nobody's fault, it's just over\\" * De- escalation ‚Äì breaking up to see if the relationship endures =Bilateral and indirect= * Fadeaway ‚Äì both people in the relationship grow apart =Bilateral and direct= * The blame game ‚Äì both partners dissatisfied and blaming each other * Negotiated farewell ‚Äì realize problems cannot be solved and negotiate breakup Duck's Stages of dissolution Steve Duck's (1982) four stages of relationship dissolution, each very distinctive with specific components, are moved through once one or both of the partners have crossed a cognitive threshold. =Intrapsychic stage= Intrapsychic stage begins with one partner who is dissatisfied and secretively searches for a way to \\"fix\\" the relationship. Vaughan (1986) states that uncoupling begins with a secret, and Duck asserts that the secret of unhappiness is kept that way through the intrapsychic stage. =Dyadic stage= Dyadic stage where the dissatisfied partner decides to fix the problem by confronting the other partner, thus entering into uncharted territory. This may not fix what is wrong and just continue to draw out the relationship until the unhappy partner becomes determined to depart, which will move the relationship into the next phase. =Social stage= Social stage is when the partners devise their accounts of how the breakup happened and how they will present it to their social circles. If it is in fact the end, they will cross over into the final phase of relationship dissolution. =Grave-dressing stage= Grave-dressing stage is simply the \\"attempt to bury and describe the relationship\\" stage. Partners now create an acceptable story about their love and loss, do whatever cognitive work, including introspection, attribution, rationalization, and reassessment of self and other, which is necessary in order to get over the deceased relationship. Modification of Duck's Stage Model Stephanie Rollie and Steve Duck (2006) subsequently modified the original model after a critique of stage models that appear to suppose an orderly and relatively conscious progression through the above stages. Proposing instead five phases of breakdown, Rollie and Duck added a Resurrection Phase which was placed after \\"Grave Dressing\\" and represented the period of reconfiguration of self and preparation for new relationships. In the modified proposal, the authors articulated changes to communication patterns and topics that would typify each phase, but clarified that the result of the communication could at any time be not simply progression to the next phase of break up but reversion to an earlier state of the relationship. Grief =Experience= Harvey (1996) explains that when you experience a loss or a depletion of resources, you may need some time to sort out what you had in the first place, what was given up in the breakup, and what remains for you to rely on, cherish or use. Grief is not a passive experience but a series of active choices for the grieving person to confront and resolve in either the direction of healing or prolonged suffering (Neeld, 1990). =Four central tasks of grief= Weber (1998) outlines the following central tasks for dealing with grief. # Express your emotions. Expressing sorrow and rage is one of the central tasks of grief (Leick & Davidsen-Nielsen, 1990). Whether you express it to a sympathetic friend or write down your feelings and thoughts in a journal (Pennebaker, 1990) which can bring long-term benefits, such as greater well-being and emotional recovery. # What happened? Figuring out what happened by doing the cognitive work to review the relationship but also accept the reasons for the failure. Survivors of a broken relationship should write their own story on what happened (Kingma, 1987) which will provide some emotional release and a way to cope with the situation. All this is done to provide some closure to the experience. # Realize, don't idealize. Use various strategies to lessen the pain of the breakup. One strategy is the silent ridicule where the one left behind imagines a flaw in the other partner and mentally exaggerates it to the point of humor (Phillips & Judd, 1978). Once the person is seen as human with flaws, it's easier to leave him or her behind. # Prepare to feel better. If there was a sense that something was wrong for a period of time, it can create a sense of relief when the other shoe finally drops. If the person left can get to the point of laughter over the situation, the healing process will break the bonds of misery since it's incompatible with self-imposed mourning (Frankel & Tien, 1993). Look for what was actually funny about the relationship which in turn can accelerate the process of healing.

Since 2018, he also has published crime stories set in Corsica under the pen name Vitu Falconi. Thiemeyer studied art and geology in Cologne. His first children's book was published in 1989 by the Ravensburger publishing house, where he also worked as graphic advisor. Two years later, he decided to become a freelance artist, illustrating games, children's books, book covers and much more. Among other publishers, he has worked for Heyne Verlag, Arena, Fantasy Productions, Beltz & Gelberg, HarperCollins, Random House and Wizards of the Coast. In 2014, one of his paintings based on the biblical story of Noah was exhibited in an art show in New York City curated by the American film director Darren Aronofsky. In Germany, Thiemeyer's work was repeatedly awarded the Kurd-La√üwitz-Preis and the Deutscher Phantastik-Preis (a German Fantasy award). In 2004, his debut novel \\"Medusa\\" published by Droemer Knaur became an international success. Many other novels both for adults as well as for young readers followed, some of them became bestsellers. His novels have been translated into English, Spanish, Dutch, Czech, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Korean, Italian, Turkish, Chinese, Portuguese as well as Slovenian. His stories are set in the tradition of classic adventure novels and often deal with the discovery of ancient cultures, including supernatural threats by mysterious powers. - As he had previously illustrated a picture book on dinosaurs, Thiemeyer was invited in 1998 to draw pictures for a book for young readers in Tanzania on the dinosaurs of Tendaguru, the historic and most important discovery of dinosaur fossils in Africa. Thomas Thiemeyer lives in Stuttgart, Germany, with his wife and two sons.  Novels  Novels for readers of all ages: *Medusa, Knaur publishers, Munich 2004, and ASIN B07V49GRMD (English edition) Researcher Hannah Peter makes a strange discovery: a Medusa sculpture, with snakelike extremities and a cyclops eye, indicates that there is a cave deep in the mountains, where a fantastically beautiful and incredibly dangerous object is located. A team from the National Geographic Society is assigned to search for this treasure. Along with Chris, the climatologist of the group, Hannah discovers the origin and at the same time the end of an age-old culture. * Reptilia, Knaur publishers, Munich 2005, (German edition) and ASIN B07V498TVQ (English edition) The young geneticist David Astbury is asked by a wealthy friend of his father's for help, as her daughter Emily has disappeared while on an expedition in the Congo. She was on a hunt for the legendary monster Mok√®l√©-mb√®mb√©, the sole survivor of the age of dinosaurs. Thus, David prepares to go into the depths of the jungle of the Congo. He is accompanied by a Congolese biologist and two foreign game hunters. When they seek out the ancient reptile at Lake Tele, strange events begin to unfold. The reptile holds a genetic secret, which could forever change the way of life on earth. * Magma, Knaur publishing house 2007, (German edition) and ASIN B07WCQ8BNV (English edition) Seismologist Dr. Ella Jordan gets the news that strange signals are being received in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. They are, however, much too regular to be caused by anything natural and seem to originate from the 10,000 meter deep Mariana Trench. Ella drops everything to join a team of researchers heading over there in the most advanced submarine in the world. Along with a Japanese crew, an attractive U.S. Marine officer, and a somewhat shady Swiss professor, Konrad Martin, Ella and her team descent to the deepest spot on earth and barely escape disaster: They find a gigantic, perfectly round stone that reacts to their probing with a deadly heat ray. What hardly anyone knows is that hidden away in the mountains of Switzerland, there is an underground lab, where scientists are working on a similar, though smaller ball of stone, found decades earlier next to the corpse of a geologist. Suddenly new signals are detected: first from the North Pole, then from Russia, Australia, and the Antarctic. Ella and Konrad Martin find these same inexplicable stone shapes everywhere. When the stones‚Äô signals start to be sent in unison, the resulting seismic waves are so strong that they cause earthquakes and volcanoes, but that is just the beginning. A countdown to disaster begins, and Ella recognizes the terrible truth. The threat does not come from this world. * Nebra, Knaur publishers 2009, . Around the Brocken in the Harz Mountains, towns and hotels are preparing for the Walpurgis Night, and archaeologist Hannah Peters is on her way. Her job is to explore the mysterious Nebra sky disk, a spectacular Bronze Age find. What she doesn't know: The disc is the object of desire of a dark cult, lurking in the caves of the Harz mountains, having waited for a long time to celebrate an all- destructive ritual. Hannah is drawn deeper and deeper into the force of the cult - and soon strange celestial phenomena announce a Walpurgis Night, that will never end. * Korona, Knaur publishers 2010, (German edition) Amy Walker, a biologist specializing on gorillas, has nightmares ever since a member of her team has mysteriously disappeared. Ironically, an ex-con is to join the team. Nobody - except the gorillas - trusts him. Despite threatening solar activity and strange weather phenomena, the team travels to the East African Rwenzori Mountains to locate the missing persons, and an adventure starts that takes Amy to the limits of her mind. * Valhalla, Knaur Verlag, 2014, (German edition) * Devil's River, Knaur publishers, 2015, (German edition) * Babylon, Knaur publishers, 2016, (German edition) Novels for young readers: * Die Stadt der Regenfresser (The city of the rain eaters) Loewe publishing house, Bindlach 2009, * Der Palast des Poseidon (The palace of Poseidon), Loewe publishing house, Bindlach 2010, and others  Audiobooks  * Magma, AME H√∂ren 2007, read by Johannes Steck, * The city of the raineaters, Jumbo 2009, read by Dietmar Wunder, * Nebra, Argon 2009, read by Franziska Pigulla, * Korona, Argon 2010, read by Dietmar Wunder, * The palace of Poseidon, Jumbo 2010, read by Dietmar Wunder,  Awards/Prizes  * 1989 selection list to Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis. \\"Das gro√üe Buch der Saurier\\" Ravensburger publishing house * 1998 Kurd-La√üwitz-Preis for best envelope illustration. \\"Auf zwei Planeten\\" Heyne-Verlag * 2002 Kurd-La√üwitz-Preis for best envelope illustration. \\"Quest\\" Heyne-Verlag * 2003 Kurd-La√üwitz-Preis for best envelope illustration. \\"Jupiter\\" Heyne-Verlag * 2004 Kurd-La√üwitz-Preis for best envelope illustration. \\"Asteroidenkrieg\\" Heyne-Verlag * 2006 Kurd-La√üwitz- Preis for best envelope illustration. \\"Die Legende von Eden und andere Visionen\\" Shayol * Deutscher Phantastik-Preis 2006 References  External links  * Official site * Television documentation on YouTube.com * Microsite about the novel Magma 1963 births Living people German fantasy writers German-language writers German illustrators German male writers ","title":"Thomas Thiemeyer"},{"id":"12889156","text":"Ilex tateana is a species of plant in the family Aquifoliaceae.

IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2013.1. Downloaded on 02 September 2013.  Description  Illicium tenuifolium is a small slender tree that is approximately ten to fifteen meters in height. The girth of the Illicium tenuifolium is approximately twenty to thirty centimeters. The genius of this plant species is Illicium, belonging to the family Schisandraceae (Austrobaileyales: Magnoliopsida). = Leaves = Leaves are arranged in a whorl pattern around the node of the stem containing about three to four leaves per node. The leaves are composed on the stem that arise from a single point known as a palmate compound leaf. The physical structure of the leaves are noted to be very thin, leathery and somewhat stiff to the touch. When the leaves are dried along the secondary veins, the leaves become disfigured having a chartaceous characteristic that is a flat paper trait. The leaves are also narrower in shape. The venation in the leaves run in a reticulate venation where the midrib, which gives support to the leaf, and secondary (and even tertiary) veins are seen. = Flowers = The petals of I. tenuifolim are white in colour along its base, which later fades into a pink or red close to the tips of the petal. The arrangement of the petal is noted to be in a cup- like structure, encasing the stamen and ovary in a cluster of seven to eight petals per flower. The pedicels that attach the flower to the flowering branch is ten to fifty millimeters in length. Pollen grains are described morphologically as trisyncolpate. = Fruit = When the fruit that is produced by I. tenuifolium are under development, they have a hue that is green or reddish in colour. When the fruit are fully developed, they appear to be a woody with a brown colour. I. tenuifolium contains eight carpels; with the fruit comprising up to thirteen follicles.  Hazard  I. tenuifolium is considered to be a problem residential and urban areas due to its vigorous growth alongside various buildings and infrastructure.

Part of a condominium boom occurring in the city, the Murano was announced in 2005 and was developed jointly by Thomas Properties Group and P&A; Associates. The building, named after Murano, Italy, was completed in 2008 at a cost of US$165 million. The site, previously occupied by a parking lot, was the location of the Erlanger Theatre from 1927 to 1978. The blue glass and concrete, 43-story, skyscraper was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz and Associates. Murano's condos range between and and were designed to be loft-like with each featuring a balcony. The building features ground level retail space and an adjacent parking garage. Located in the Logan Square neighborhood of Center City, in a part that first saw residential development in 2002, the building struggled to fill its units during the late-2000s recession. In July 2009 the Murano's owners held a successful auction on forty of the building's units. Thomas Properties Group lowered the price for the remaining unsold units based on what the forty units went for at the auction. History The Murano was announced in 2005 when Philadelphia was experiencing a condominium boom that had begun in the late 1990s; between 1998 and 2004 more than 70 Center City office and manufacturing buildings had been converted into rental and condominium apartments. The project was jointly developed by Thomas Properties Group of Los Angeles and P&A; Associates of Philadelphia. The planned site of the Murano was on West Market Street in Center City, an area which had not had any residential development until 2002 when 2121 Market Street was converted into apartments. Construction began around the end of 2005. Murano under construction in October 2007. Built by construction firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano was completed in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling to take a chance on the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower to help pay for condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction. Architecture and features Located at 21st and Market Streets, the 43-story, Murano is named after Murano, Italy, a town famous for its glass. Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz and Associates, the Murano has 302 condos that include one to three bedroom condos that range from to . Also included are penthouses that range from to . The condominiums are designed to be loft-like and each feature a balcony. The curved facade features floor-to- ceiling blue windows separated at intervals by bands of white concrete. The Murano contains including of ground floor retail space. Adjacent to the building on 21st Street is a parking garage. The developers planned to put ground level retail in the parking garage but say they were dissuaded by residents who feared the shops would attract the homeless. Philadelphia Inquirer architecture critic Inga Saffron praised how the concrete bands break up the glass and \\"serve as a bridge, linking the Murano visually to its older neighbors\\". However, she criticized how the building doesn't connect physically to its neighbors, such as lack of access to John F. Kennedy Boulevard and lack of shops on the ground floor of the parking garage. Saffron believed shops in the parking garage would have helped create a connection between West Market Street and the Logan Square neighborhood.

He also served as the President of the North Carolina Council of Churches. Historical assessment Author Grady L.E. Carroll wrote this about Bishop Peele: :None of the high honors that came to him caused him to lose the \\"common touch\\" which he prized so high.

It acts as a topoisomerase II poison and intercalating agent. The code name BBR 2778 refers to pixantrone dimaleate, the actual substance commonly used in clinical trials. History Anthracyclines are important chemotherapy agents. However, their use is associated with irreversible and cumulative heart damage. Investigators have attempted to design related drugs that maintain the biological activity, but do not possess the cardiotoxicity of the anthracyclines. Pixantrone was developed to reduce heart damage related to treatment while retaining efficacy. Random screening at the US National Cancer Institute of a vast number of compounds provided by the Allied Chemical Company led to the discovery of ametantrone as having significant anti-tumor activity. Further investigation regarding the rational development of analogs of ametantrone led to the synthesis of mitoxantrone, which also exhibited marked anti-tumor activity Mitoxantrone was considered as an analog of doxorubicin with less structural complexity but with a similar mode of action. In clinical studies, mitoxantrone was shown to be effective against numerous types of tumors with less toxic side effects than those resulting from doxorubicin therapy. However, mitoxantrone was not totally free of cardiotoxicity. A number of structurally modified analogs of mitoxantrone were synthesized and structure-activity relationship studies made. BBR 2778 was originally synthesized by University of Vermont researchers Miles P. Hacker and Paul A. Krapcho and initially characterized in vitro for tumor cell cytotoxicity and mechanism of action by studies at the Boehringer Mannheim Italia Research Center, Monza, and University of Vermont, Burlington. Other studies have been completed at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, the Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, and the University of Padua. In the search for novel heteroanalogs of anthracenediones, it was selected as the most promising compound. Toxicological studies indicated that BBR 2778 was not cardiotoxic, and US patents are held by the University of Vermont. An additional US patent application was completed in June 1995 by Boehringer Mannheim, Italy. Novuspharma, an Italian company, was established in 1998 following the merger of Boehringer Mannheim and Hoffmann-La Roche, and BBR 2778 was developed as Novuspharma's leading anti-cancer drug, pixantrone. A patent application for the injectable preparation was filed in May 2003. In 2003, Cell Therapeutics, a Seattle biotechnology company, acquired pixantrone through a merger with Novuspharma.  Clinical trials  Pixantrone is a substance that is being studied in the treatment of cancer. It belongs to the family of drugs called antitumor antibiotics. phase III clinical trials of pixantrone have been completed. Pixantrone is being studied as an antineoplastic for different kinds of cancer, including solid tumors and hematological malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Animal studies demonstrated that pixantrone does not worsen pre-existing heart muscle damage, suggesting that pixantrone may be useful in patients pretreated with anthracyclines. While only minimal cardiac changes are observed in mice given repeated cycles of pixantrone, 2 cycles of traditional anthracyclines doxorubicin or mitoxantrone result in marked or severe heart muscle degeneration. Clinical trials substituting pixantrone for doxorubicin in standard first-line treatment of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, had a reduction in severe side effects when compared to patients treated with standard doxorubicin-based therapy. Despite pixantrone patients receiving more treatment cycles, a three-fold reduction in the incidence of severe heart damage was seen as well as clinically significant reductions in infections and thrombocytopenia, and a significant reduction in febrile neutropenia. These findings could have major implications for treating patients with breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia, where debilitating cardiac damage from doxorubicin might be prevented. Previous treatment options for multiply relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma had disappointing response rates. The completed phase II RAPID trial compared the CHOP-R regimen of Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone, and Rituximab to the same regimen, but substituting Doxorubicin with Pixantrone. The objective was to show that Pixantrone was not inferior to Doxorubicin and less toxic to the heart. Pixantrone was shown to have potentially reduced cardiotoxicity and demonstrated promising clinical activity in these phase II studies in heavily pretreated non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. The pivotal phase III EXTEND (PIX301) randomized clinical trial studied pixantrone to see how well it works compared to other chemotherapy drugs in treating patients with relapsed non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. The complete response rate in patients treated with pixantrone has been significantly higher than in those receiving other chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive non- Hodgkin lymphoma. Administration It can be administered through a peripheral vein rather than a central implanted catheter as required for other similar drugs.  Regulatory approval  = U.S. Food and Drug Administration = The FDA granted fast track designation for pixantrone in patients who had previously been treated two or more times for relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL. Study sponsor Cell Therapeutics announced that Pixantrone achieved the primary efficacy endpoint. The minutes of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting of March 22, 2010 show that this had not in fact been achieved with statistical significance and this combined with major safety concerns lead to the conclusion that the trial was not sufficient to support approval. In April 2010 the FDA asked for an additional trial. = European Medicines Agency = On May 5, 2009, Pixantrone became available in Europe on a Named-Patient Basis. A named-patient program is a compassionate use drug supply program under which physicians can legally supply investigational drugs to qualifying patients. Under a named-patient program, investigational drugs can be administered to patients who are suffering from serious illnesses prior to the drug being approved by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. \\"Named-patient\\" distribution refers to the distribution or sale of a product to a specific healthcare professional for the treatment of an individual patient. In Europe, under the named-patient program the drug is most often purchased through the national health system. In 2012 pixantrone received conditional marketing authorization in the European Union as Monotherapy to Treat Adult Patients with Multiply Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin B-Cell Lymphomas. Research Pixantrone is as potent as mitoxantrone in animal models of multiple sclerosis. Pixantrone has a similar mechanism of action as mitoxantrone on the effector function of lymphomonocyte B and T cells in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis but with lower cardiotoxicity. Pixantrone inhibits antigen specific and mitogen induced lymphomononuclear cell proliferation, as well as IFN-gamma production. Clinical trials are currently ongoing in Europe. Pixantrone also reduces the severity of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis in Lewis rats, and in vitro cell viability experiments indicated that Pixantrone significantly reduces amyloid beta (A beta(1-42)) neurotoxicity, a mechanism implicated in Alzheimer's disease.

He is considered the father of pictorial journalism through his founding of The Illustrated London News, the first illustrated magazine. He was a Liberal politician who favoured social reform and represented Boston for four years until his early death in the shipwreck of the Lady Elgin. Early life Ingram was born at Paddock Grove, Boston, Lincolnshire, the son of a butcher., quoted on The Early History of The Illustrated London News After being educated at Laughton's Charity School and the free school in Wormgate (a street in Boston), he was apprenticed as a 14-year-old to town printer Joseph Clarke. When Ingram finished his training, he moved to London, where he worked as a journeyman printer. In 1832, Ingram established his own printing and newsagents business in Nottingham, in partnership with his brother-in-law, Nathaniel Cooke. As a newsagent, he noticed that when newspapers included woodcuts, their sales increased. He concluded that making a good profit would be possible from a magazine that included a large number of illustrations. However, a while was needed before he could put this theory into practice. The newsagent business failed to make much progress until Ingram purchased the rights to a laxative known as Parr's Life Pills. The profits from marketing these pills provided the capital that enabled him to set up and publish The Illustrated London News. The Illustrated London News Ingram moved back to London, and after discussing the matter with his friend, Mark Lemon, the editor of Punch, he decided to start his own magazine ‚Äì The Illustrated London News. The first edition appeared on 14 May 1842. Costing sixpence, the magazine had 16 pages and 32 woodcuts and targeted a broadly middle-class readership. It included pictures of the war in Afghanistan, a train crash in France, a steam boat explosion in Canada, and a fancy dress ball at Buckingham Palace. That pictorials were viewed as being as important as text for reporting was clear from the first issue, which stated that the aim was to bring within the public grasp \\"... the very form and presence of events as they transpire; and whatever the broad and palpable delineations of wood engraving can achieve, will now be brought to bear upon every subject which attracts the attention of mankind\\". Ingram was a staunch Liberal who favoured social reform. He announced in The Illustrated London News that the concern of the magazine would be \\"with the English poor\\" and the \\"three essential elements of discussion with us will be the poor laws, the factory laws, and the working of the mining system\\". Despite arguing the case for social reform, the paper claimed to be nonpartisan. Its first editorial had stated, \\"We commence our political discourse by a disavowal of the unconquerable aversion to the name of Party.\\" However, this may have been no more than a desire to gain the widest possible readership, because as time progressed, the paper displayed its Whig inclination. It showed moderation and caution in its reportage and this extended to that of the Irish Famine, which was largely sympathetic, even if not quite able to denounce the inadequacy of government policy or the ideas of prevailing economic or political orthodoxy. It had none of the overt negative stereotyping found in the most acerbic Punch cartoons. Overall, it shoed an attitude that England had a responsibility towards the victims of what was largely interpreted as a natural disaster. The magazine was an immediate success, and the first edition sold 26,000 copies. Within a few months, it was selling over 65,000 copies a week. High prices were charged for advertisements, and Ingram was soon making ¬£12,000 a year from this publishing venture. Encouraged by the success of The Illustrated London News, Ingram decided in 1848 to start a daily newspaper, the London Telegraph. When Andrew Spottiswoode started a rival paper, the Pictorial Times, Ingram purchased it and merged it with the Illustrated London News. In 1855, Ingram took over another rival, the Illustrated Times. Ingram employed leading artists of the day to illustrate social events, news stories, and towns and cities. The whole spectrum of Victorian Britain was recorded pictorially in The Illustrated London News for many decades; special events were important to its success. The magazine did very well during the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the edition that reported the funeral of the Duke of Wellington in 1852 sold between 150,000 and 250,000 copies, according to various accounts. Illustrations came from all corners of the globe. By 1855, Ingram was using colour and had artists in Great Britain and continental Europe racing to the scene of stories to capture the drama in print. The Crimean War caused a further boost to sales. By 1863, after Ingram's death, The Illustrated London News was selling over 300,000 copies a week, far higher than other journals. For example, newspapers such as the Daily News sold 6,000 copies at this time, and even the largest-selling newspaper, The Times, only sold 70,000 copies. The Illustrated London News is still published today. Alison Booth, current editor, said: \\"He was very inventive and far-sighted and his legacy of bringing pictures to journalism can still be seen on the front pages of newspapers and magazines all over the world. The Illustrated London News had many imitators, but none came close. His first edition featured a great fire in Hamburg, Germany, and drawings portrayed the horror for readers. The popularity of the paper soared and attracted the most talented artists.\\" MP for Boston In 1856, Ingram became the Liberal candidate in a by-election in his home town of Boston. With help from his friends Mark Lemon and Douglas Jerrold at Punch, and from the team at The Illustrated London News, Ingram advocated a policy of social reform. He told the people of Boston they needed a \\"representative who is at once the product and the embodiment of the progressive spirit of the age\\". The electorate responded to Ingram's message and he won an overwhelming victory. However, several daily newspapers attacked Punch and The Illustrated London News for the part they had played in Ingram's victory. Statue of Ingram in Boston He continued his campaign for social reform in the House of Commons until his death four years later. Ingram was instrumental in bringing the Great Northern Railway to Boston, which forged new links with other parts of the country and got the town on track for a new era of growth. He also played a major part in supplying fresh piped water to the town, a move that was met with rejoicing and brass bands when the taps were turned on for the first time. Death and legacy In 1860, Ingram went to the US with his eldest son to obtain material for The Illustrated London News. On 8 September, they were aboard the Lady Elgin on Lake Michigan when the ship was sunk after colliding with another vessel. Herbert Ingram, his son, and hundreds of other passengers were drowned. Herbert was brought back to Boston for burial in the Boston Cemetery on Horncastle Road. His son's body was never found and identified and was probably buried in an unmarked grave in Winnetka near Chicago. Another of Ingram's sons, William, took over the newspaper, and was also MP for Boston and became a baronet. A statue of Ingram is in the Market Place in Boston in front of St. Botolph's Church (Boston \\"Stump\\"). The statue was designed by Alexander Munro (sculptor) and was unveiled in October 1862. The allegorical figure at the base of the monument is a reference to Ingram's efforts to bring the first piped water to the town.

Historically in Staffordshire. History In the late-18th century and early-19th century, the workers of Walsall Wood were primarily involved in the mining of limestone. In 1864, the population of the settlement expanded as Walsall Wood Colliery was opened, as well as another colliery in nearby Shelfield. The Walsall Wood Colliery purchased the Pelsall Colliery from Pelsall Coal & Iron Co. in 1894. The opening of the Walsall Wood Colliery saw the establishment of the first public services, including a police station and a post office. The mine was closed in 1964 when the supply of accessible coal had been exhausted: In 2010 a memorial pithead designed by Luke Perry was erected to commemorate the village's mining heritage. The pithead is one of a number of additions by artist Luke Perry. The Fisherman located next to the bridge on the high Street. This piece had to be mounted on a three-metre plinth to allow it to be seen from the road. Despite the height of the work inspired locals replaced the fish which originally hung from the rod with a golden wellington boot, they then swapped that for the Olympic rings in July 2012. St John's Church in Walsall Wood was constructed in 1837 at a cost of ¬£1,200. The church, with its quadrangular tower, is in the Gothic style, whilst the parsonage house is in the Elizabethan style.

She previously played club football in Sweden for Damallsvenskan clubs including Malm√∂ FF, Link√∂pings FC, Kristianstads DFF and Kopparbergs/G√∂teborg FC as well as Chelsea in the English FA WSL. Since making her international debut in 2002, Lindahl has accrued over 115 caps for the Sweden women's national football team. On 3 August 2014 Lindahl played her 100th cap for Sweden women's national football team against England. On 17 September 2015 Lindahl played her 113th cap and thereby broke Elisabeth Leidinge's record to become the most capped Swedish female goalkeeper. She has kept goal for Sweden at the UEFA Women's Championship, the FIFA Women's World Cup and the Olympic Games. Lindahl was the Swedish women's goalkeeper of the year in 2004, 2005, 2009, 2014 and 2015. She won the 2015 Diamantbollen, after being one of three nominations for Damallsvenskan's Most Valuable Player in 2014. In 2016, Lindahl was one of 5 nominees for Women's PFA Players' Player of the Year and was also picked for the WSL Team of the Year. Early career At the age of 13 Lindahl decided to focus on becoming a professional football player. Previously Lindahl had played both as a forward and a goalkeeper, but eventually concentrated on goalkeeping. Lindahl, who was raised in Marmorbyn, was selected to play on the S√∂rmland team. This was a temporary team for which the best age group football players in S√∂dermanland were selected to play. Lindahl's national team career began in 1998 when as a part of the S√∂rmland team she participated at an Elite Girls Camp in Halmstad. There she was selected for the Allstar Team, where the best football players born ‚àí83 participated. Each 15-year-old footballer was measured on a five-point scale. Lindahl received rarely awarded full marks; five out of five. Club career Lindahl started her club career at Gropptorps IF, outside Katrineholm in S√∂dermanland, a boys' team. Lindahl then played for Torp IF, DFK V√§rmbol and Tunafors SK. Lindahl playing for G√∂teborg She moved into the Damallsvenskan with Malm√∂ FF Dam in 2001 after being scouted by Malm√∂ and Sweden national youth team coach Elisabeth Leidinge. During her three seasons at Malm√∂, Lindahl faced strong competition from the national team goalkeeper at the time Caroline J√∂nsson. She finished the 2003 season on loan to IF Trion, then spent five seasons with Link√∂pings FC, joining Kopparbergs/G√∂teborg FC in 2009. Despite 21 shutouts in 43 matches during two seasons with G√∂teborg, coach Torbj√∂rn Nilsson did not renew Lindahl's contract. Instead she moved to ambitious Kristianstads DFF in time for the 2011 season. Lindahl signed for London-based FA WSL club Chelsea Ladies in December 2014. After four \\"clean sheets\\" in her first five games, Chelsea coach Emma Hayes hailed Lindahl as the best goalkeeper in the WSL. At the 2015 FA Women's Cup Final, staged at Wembley Stadium for the first time, Lindahl kept goal in Chelsea's 1‚Äì0 win over Notts County. It was Chelsea's first major trophy. In October 2015 she also started Chelsea's 4‚Äì0 win over Sunderland which secured the club's first FA WSL title and a League and Cup \\"double\\". In April 2019, Lindahl announced she would depart Chelsea at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 campaign after four seasons with the club. On 17 July 2019, Lindahl signed a one-year deal with Wolfsburg. International career Lindahl was on the U21 national team as of 1998 and subsequently progressed to the full Swedish women's national team. Despite her position as second goalkeeper at club level, Lindahl gained the confidence of the then national team coach Marika Domanski-Lyfors, which led to Lindahl's 2002 debut in the senior women's national team and a silver medal in the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup. Lindahl has indicated that her senior international debut came in January 2002, a 5‚Äì0 win over England in a behind closed doors match in La Manga. Proud of her debut \\"clean sheet\\", she has expressed irritation at reports which sometimes confuse that match with Sweden's 6‚Äì3 win over England at the Algarve Cup six weeks later. After moving to Link√∂pings and securing first team football at club level, Lindahl began to compete more equally with Caroline J√∂nsson and Sofia Lundgren for appearances at international level. She understudied J√∂nsson at the 2004 Olympics. By the time of UEFA Women's Euro 2005 in England, Lindahl was Sweden's first choice goalkeeper and played in all three group games, as well as the extra-time semi final defeat to rivals Norway. Lindahl as goalkeeper for Sweden in the 2011 World Cup Incoming national team coach Thomas Dennerby retained Lindahl and she featured at both the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup and 2008 Olympics in China and UEFA Women's Euro 2009 in Finland. She remained Sweden's number one goalkeeper for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany, where Sweden came third, and the 2012 London Olympics. In September 2012 Lindahl suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury while playing for Kristianstad. She was recalled to new coach Pia Sundhage's national squad in May 2013, ahead of UEFA Women's Euro 2013 in Sweden. During Lindahl's absence Kristin Hammarstr√∂m had taken over the national team's goalkeeper position and remained in place as hosts Sweden lost 1‚Äì0 to Germany in the semi-final. In September 2014 Lindahl underwent elective double hip surgery for an impingement that she had been suffering from since late 2013. Although she had been in pain throughout the year, she played one of her best seasons. She chose the surgery as she was determined to play in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup and did not want to risk her body failing during if the tournament, if selected. Delaying the surgery would also have carried with it the risk of a double hip replacement for Lindahl in the future. She was called back to the national squad for the 2015 Algarve Cup. At the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Lindahl was back as Sweden's first choice goalkeeper. In the team's 4‚Äì1 second round loss to Germany, she made several saves to prevent an even heavier defeat. In November 2015 Lindahl won the Diamantbollen, the award for Sweden's female player of the year. Personal life Lindahl suffers from vitiligo and has to apply high factor sunscreen before and during matches. She married her wife Sabine in 2011. They have two children together born in 2014 and 2017. Lindahl's father was a footballer for IFK Norrk√∂ping in the 1970s. She speaks fluent English.

Career The first three clubs that Salem played for were Grenoble, Cr√©teil and Ch√¢teauroux. In 2005, he moved to the Dutch team De Graafschap. After impressing at De Graafschap, Salem went on a trial with Nottingham Forest in August 2007. After a successful trial spell at Forest, a deal could not be put in place so Yannick moved to AGOVV Apeldoorn, his second Dutch team. AGOVV Apeldoorn had a lot of financial problems which meant many of the first team players could not feature. After two frustrating seasons with the Dutch club, Salem moved to Belgian club K.S.K. Beveren and then the following season to the rich SV Eintracht Trier 05. The German club spent a lot of money on salaries in order to recruit the best possible players and move up the German divisions, however this did not lead to success on the pitch which led to a number of players, including Yannick, to break their contracts. On 30 October 2010 Salem signed a short-term deal at Stockport County in England. International career Salem has been called up to the national team for Congo on a number of occasions.

Descended from a well known family of cotton spinners from Bolton, Lancashire, Franklin Thomasson was born on 16 August 1873 at Alderley Edge, Cheshire, the 3rd child of John Pennington Thomasson, who was a benefactor and MP for Bolton. He married Elizabeth, a daughter of the late Caleb Coffin of New York City on 11 July 1895. They had 3 children, John (1898), Marjorie (1901) and Barbara (1903). Franklin contested the Westhoughton Parliamentary division in 1900, and Stretford in 1901, but on both occasions he was unsuccessful. He became Liberal MP for Leicester at a by-election in 1906, however, sharing the representation of the double-member constituency with Ramsay MacDonald. He retired at the January 1910 election. In 1906, Thomasson ventured on a bold but disastrous experiment in newspaper production by founding the Tribune (1906‚Äì1908). He played a large part in local political life before he left Bolton for London. During World War I he commanded the 2-5th Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment. His wife Elizabeth died in 1927 and he then married Gertrude Prescott. They had three children, Margaret (1930), Christopher (1932) and Jenny (1937).

He is best known for his work opposing the development of the Alberta oil sands and reliance on fossil fuels in general, but has also engaged in civil liberties and student activism. He is also the published author of a book on direct action tactics. Background Mike Hudema was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta in 1976 from Ukrainian and English origin parents and attended Crescent Heights High School. He graduated from the University of Alberta with a bachelor of education, majoring in drama, and a bachelor of law degree, specializing in labour and environmental law. During his university career, he went on an exchange to southern India, which he credits with awakening him politically. During the exchange, he recalls seeing 20,000 people \\"getting together to debate the village budget for the next year\\", and says that the contrast between that and the models of representative democracy in use in Canada affected him and shaped his views on political involvement. Environmental activism Hudema is best known as an environmental activist. He protested the opening of the Cheviot mine near Hinton, Alberta in 2004 by setting up a mock open pit mine on the lawn of Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan's constituency office. He has also opposed the harvesting of Alberta's boreal forest, and in 2004 followed logging executives down the Athabasca River as the executives took a boat trip as part of a logging conference. Hudema at the Los Angeles auto show at which he challenged General Motors CEO Richard Wagoner In 2005, Hudema was hired as the Freedom From Oil Director for Global Exchange, and relocated from Edmonton to San Francisco. In this capacity, he helped lead the \\"Jumpstart Ford\\" campaign (a joint initiative between Global Exchange, the Rainforest Action Network, and the Ruckus Society) which pressured Ford Motors to eliminate tailpipe emissions from its vehicles by 2020. The campaign was later expanded to include all automakers, and renamed \\"Freedom From Oil\\". As part of this campaign, Hudema interrupted General Motors CEO Richard Wagoner at the keynote address of a Los Angeles automotive show and asked him to sign a commitment to make General Motors vehicles the most fuel efficient in the world by 2010 (Wagoner refused to sign, saying that his \\"speech spoke for itself\\"). In 2006, Hudema implored Canadians to \\"save hockey\\" by fighting climate change, which he called \\"the biggest threat to hockey since the NHL labor talks\\". In July 2007, Hudema returned to Edmonton to work as the Climate and Energy Campaigner for Greenpeace Canada at its newly opened Edmonton office, which was created to lobby for an end to the Alberta oil sands, which Hudema called \\"one of the dirtiest, oiliest projects in the world\\". In this capacity, he ambushed Premier Ed Stelmach several times during the 2008 provincial election. He also made headlines after the election when he and two other Greenpeace volunteers lowered a banner - reading \\"$telmach, the best premier oil money can buy\\" - behind Stelmach at a fundraising dinner. In January 2008, he was briefly banned from the University of Alberta campus after he and a group of fellow radical cheerleaders performed a number of anti-fossil fuels musical routines at an on-campus Shell Canada recruiting session. After a meeting with the head of the university's campus security service, the ban was reduced to probation. In September 2009, Hudema and 24 other Greenpeace activists occupied two oilsands heavy haulers and one shovel in Shell's Albian Sands. The action shut down the entire mine for a short period and a portion of the mine for over 30 hours. The action proceeded two other actions by Greenpeace in the oilsands region. The first was at Suncor's Millennium project, and the second at Shell's upgrading facility in Fort Saskatchewan. The actions prompted comments from then Premier Ed Stelmach about whether terrorism charges should be used to prosecute such activities. In December 2009, Hudema and Greenpeace made headlines again when they scaled Canada's Parliament buildings and unfurled several banners with messages to Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper and then Liberal Leader Michael Ignatiaff. In September 2011, Hudema helped organize the largest climate-related civil disobedience action in Canadian history when more than 200 people risked arrest on Parliament Hill by crossing a police line set-up to bar public entry into the building. October 2012 saw Hudema in Victoria where he helped craft another mass action this time against oilsands pipelines, namely Enbridge Northern Gateway and Kindermorgan TransCanada. The action saw thousands descend on the BC legislature building many willing to risk arrest to stop the pipelines. Hudema has been given several accolades for his work. In 2013 he was named 'Edmontonian of the Year' by online blogsite GigCity. Alberta Venture named him one of their 'Top 50: Most Influential People' in 2014. The Edmonton Journal named Hudema one of their 'Power 30' and the Globe and Mail named him one of nine people to leave their mark on the oil sands. Hudema is a \\"climb trainer\\" for the Ruckus Society, and has held activist training camps which teach aspiring activists skills ranging from climbing to blockades. =Criticism= Hudema's actions at the General Motors car show were described as \\"stupid\\" by automotive journalist Mike Magda. Student activism Hudema teaching rappelling at an activist workshop In 2002, Hudema was elected president of the University of Alberta Students' Union, defeating six opponents (two of whom were, as \\"joke candidates\\", ineligible to win) after campaigning on a more militant approach to tuition and on increased interaction between the Students' Union's elected officials and its members. His candidacy came after his activities as a member of the Student Worker Action Group, which had been critical of the previous president's more moderate approach to opposing tuition increases, including efforts to support the reduction of tuition increases, rather than insisting on their elimination. As president, Hudema opposed the university administration's proposed tuition increase, and particularly the portion of the increase that would see students in some programs pay more than those in others. Despite his opposition, the basic increase was approved as proposed, and two of the three program-based differentials were also approved. He also opposed the extension of degree granting powers (which were only granted to universities at the time) to colleges, advocated against the inclusion of education in the General Agreement on Trade in Services and Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, and unsuccessfully lobbied the City of Edmonton to stop assessing property taxes on university residences. He expanded the Students' Union's involvement in environmental issues - creating a Students' Union environmental office, spearheading an energy audit of the Students' Union's building, passing an ethical buying and purchasing policy, helping to open a Women's Centre on campus, and founding a car pool registry. He also created the Revolutionary Speaker Series; the speakers that Hudema brought to the series included consumer advocate and American presidential candidate Ralph Nader, environmentalist David Suzuki, author Inga Musico, and Palestinian activist Younis al Khatib. Despite claiming at the end of his term that he would stay out of the limelight in student politics, Hudema was vocally critical of Mat Brechtel, his successor, for what he claimed was excessive compromise on tuition-related issues. He also helped create a new university course on citizenship and activism, which he suggested should become mandatory for all undergraduate students. =Criticism= Hudema was criticized during his time as president for being too focused on tuition and for fostering an adversarial relationship with the university administration. He was also criticized for politicizing historically apolitical events, opposing an increase in law school tuition despite support for the increase from the law students' association, and for using the campus food bank to make political points. His support for the \\"U-Pass\\", a proposed discounted transit pass that would be mandatory for all students, was also controversial. Civil liberties activism Hudema protesting the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board. His sign features the image of Alberta premier Ed Stelmach. In 2001, Hudema was spokesperson of a group of about twenty people who staged a sit-in at the constituency office of Justice Minister Anne McLellan to protest the government's proposed anti-terrorism and security laws, which Hudema claimed would \\"greatly impinge on civil liberties in Canada.\\" The group \\"evicted\\" McLellan from her office - moving her furniture to the front lawn - changed her sign to read \\"Minister of In-Justice\\", held community workshops and forums in the area, and set up a hot tub with a banner that read \\"these bills put us all in hot water\\". After four days, Hudema and the rest of the protesters were removed by police and charged with trespassing. Democracy activism During the 2000 Canadian federal election, Hudema was part of a group calling itself the Edible Ballot Society, the members of which ate their ballots (Hudema stir-fried his) as a protest against what they saw as a lack of true democracy and a system that only asked for individuals' participation once every four years. He was charged, along with other members of the EBS, with \\"unlawfully and willfully altering, defacing or destroying a ballot or the initials of the Deputy Returning Officer signed on a ballot contrary to section 167(2)(a) of the Canada Elections Act thereby committing an offence under subsection 489(3)(e)\\". The charges were eventually dropped. In March 2004, Hudema said that he was unsure whether he was going to vote in the 2004 federal election, saying that he went \\"back and forth\\" on the question of whether it was more useful to perform a \\"theatrical\\" stunt to draw attention to problems with the electoral system or to work to get progressive candidates elected. Other activism Hudema was critical of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, which he called \\"an occupation by a rogue state\\". He has also attributed the invasion to North America's \\"addiction to oil\\". Hudema opposes most trade liberalization, and protested at both the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas negotiations in Quebec City with the theatre troupe FUNK (Fighting Unaccountable Naughty Korporations) in 2001 and the G8 summit in Kananaskis in 2002. During the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Hudema travelled to China to participate in protests in favour of Tibetan independence. In what he alleges was a pre-emptive move , Chinese authorities entered the apartment he was sharing with fellow activists and expelled him from the country. Writing and journalism Hudema is the author of An Action a Day Keeps Global Capitalism Away (), which was published in 2004. It is described as \\"fifty-two tried and tested actions, one for every week--an action guide for the 21st century.\\" Hudema was featured in the 2011 Canadian documentary Peace Out where he discussed impacts of Alberta's Athabasca oil sands.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2016259/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 He is also co- founder and former co-host and co-producer of Rise Up:Radio Free Edmonton, a current affairs show on CJSR, the University of Alberta's campus-community radio station. Electoral politics Hudema ran in the 2001 Alberta election as a candidate for the Alberta New Democrats in the riding of Edmonton Meadowlark. He finished third of four candidates with 5.1% of the vote, well behind winner Bob Maskell of the Progressive Conservatives and incumbent Karen Leibovici of the Alberta Liberal Party.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the HLA class II beta chain paralogues. The class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DRA) and a beta chain (DRB), both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Class II molecules are expressed in antigen-presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages).  Gene structure and polymorphisms  The beta chain is approximately 26-28 kDa. It is encoded by 6 exons, exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains, exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and exon 5 encodes the cytoplasmic tail. Within the DR molecule the beta chain contains all the polymorphisms specifying the peptide binding specificities. Hundreds of DRB1 alleles have been described and typing for these polymorphisms is routinely done for bone marrow and kidney transplantation.  Gene expression  DRB1 is expressed at a level five times higher than its paralogues DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5. DRB1 is present in all individuals. Allelic variants of DRB1 are linked with either none or one of the genes DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5. There are 4 related pseudogenes: DRB2, DRB6, DRB7, DRB8 and DRB9.

During the colonial period, the Spanish rebranded him into Maria Sinukuan, the diwata or mountain goddess associated with Mount Arayat in Pampanga, Philippines, and later became a prominent example of the mountain goddess motif in Philippine mythology; other prominent examples being Maria Makiling of Los Ba√±os and Maria Cacao of Cebu. Origin of Sinukuan Prior to Spanish colonization, Sinukuan was known as a powerful male Kapampangan god named Aring Sinuk√ªan who was on par with the Kapampangan god of Pinatubo, Ap√ªng Malyari. The two were the second most powerful deities in Kampampangan mythology, next only to Mangechay (sometimes called Mangacha), the great elder and creator goddess. Aring Sinuk√ªan was the sun god of war and death, taught the early inhabitants the industry of metallurgy, wood cutting, rice culture, and waging war. He had three children, namely, Munag Sumal√¢, the golden serpent god who represented dawn; Lakandanup, the god of gluttony who represented the sun at noon time; and Gatpanapun, the noble god who only knew pleasure and represented the afternoon. He also had a winged assistant named Galur√¢, a giant eagle deity believed to be the bringer of storms, and a wife named Mingan. However, when the Spanish arrived, they rebranded Sinukuan as a woman, thinking that the people would not revere the deity if he was a female, not knowing that the great elder deity of the Kapampangan was a goddess named Mangechay. Additionally, Sinukuan's wife, Mingan, was rebranded as male. Despite this, the natives continued to revere Sinukuan. Furious, the Spanish added \\"Maria\\" to Sinukuan's name to somewhat turn her Catholic in a bid to further subjugate the natives and convert them to Roman Catholicism.https://www.academia.edu/11314629/Myths_and_Legends_of_Pinatubo_and_Arayat Later legend as Maria Sinukuan The basic legend is similar to those of many mountain guardian goddesses, notably Maria Makiling. Sinukuan is associated with the unusual bounty of the forests in Arayat and with the profusion of animals there. Watching over the needs of the people in the nearby town, she used to regularly leave fruits and animals at the doorstep of locals who needed food during hard times. At one point, though, a group of young men got greedy. They sought out where Sinukuan‚Äôs home was in the mountains and when they found it, they asked for more than what they actually needed. Sinukuan did not object to this and allowed them to pick a great load of fruits. She warned them, however, not to get any fruits from the forest without her permission. On their way back home, they decided they would get more. \\"Why not?\\" they asked each other. \\"She won't know we took home fruits and animals. They're so plentiful, she won't know the difference.\\" But she did. As soon as they had started picking more fruit, their packs began to feel heavier. They soon discovered that all the fruit and meat they were carrying had turned into rocks. The young men ran away, but before they managed to escape the forest, Sinukuan appeared before them. As punishment, she said, she would turn them into swine. And she did. But the other people in the village were also getting greedy. More and more, they stole from Sinukuan‚Äôs forests. Angered, Sinukuan stopped leaving food at their doorsteps. She made the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to disappear. And she also never allowed the villagers to see her again. Appearance Local tradition describes Sinukuan, the Spanish-imposed female counterpart, as: > Her black hair‚Ä¶ naturally curled, reaches down to her ankles. Her eyes are > framed by long lashes which are black. Her eyebrows are arched. Her nose > which is beautifully neither too high nor too flat is finely chiseled. Her > lips are well formed. Her skin is a flawless brown. Her clothes are made of > white flowing robe. In popular culture Sinukuan or Sinyang, Kunnie, and Aning is a fictional character in Dyosa, a telefantasya being aired by ABS-CBN Network, portrayed by Filipino actress Mickey Ferriols.

It was founded in 1980 with the goal of solving socio-economic problems through helping one another in an environment of egalitarianism ‚Äî in marked contrast to the traditional norms of Amhara society. The name means \\"Top of the Hill\\" in Amharic. Founded by Zumra Nuru, who currently serves as co-chairman of the community, with 19 other people who shared his vision, as of 2016 Awra Amba has some 450 members, and is lauded as a model to alleviate poverty and promote gender equality in a country where women are generally subservient to men.Mohammed Mussa, \\"Case 5: Amhara Region: Community Self-Help in Awra Amba\\", in Annex 1: Annex to Study on Effective Empowerment of Citizens in Ethiopia: Case Studies , International NGO Training and Research Centre website (accessed 23 April 2009)http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-commune-in- ethiopia-where-feminism-is-the-law History Awra Amba was founded in 1980 by Zumra Nuru. In 1989 the community was forced out of its settlement for 4 years due to other villages viewing them as communists. After the fall of the Derg and the transition from the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the community returned to their settlement in 1993.  Description  The fact that its members work together, are diligent, disciplined and self-confident makes the Awra Amba community distinct from other Amhara communities. Women have equal rights as men and there is no distinction in divisions of labor between men and women. All people in the community have no religion as distinct from most communities in Ethiopia. They believe in hard work and being good to people. They keep their houses and their surrounding clean. Theft is seen as very obscene.\\"Ten Success Stories on Business Development Services\\" (Ethiopian Business Development Services Network) The community is ostracized, as it does not belong to either of the two primary religious groupings ‚Äî Christianity or Islam. Members of the Awra Amba community therefore were not given agricultural land to cultivate, but instead were pushed into the most infertile and malaria infested corner of the district. As they cannot live on farm activities, they have diversified into the weaving business, using both traditional and modern weaving machines. In addition, using three grinding mills provided by the Regional Micro and Small Scale Enterprise Development Agency, they offer milling service to neighbouring farmers. The village hopes to earn more money in order to build potable water and sewage systems, pave the road, and create an education fund for the children. The village is unique not only for its attitudes toward gender, religion, and education, but for the social security it provides its members in need. There are formal committees to provide services which include: education, to receive guests, to take care of patients, the elderly and children, and community health. They have established a literacy campaign for adults, a library, and a preschool. Despite living in a culture which practices early marriage, the people of Awra Amba have decided girls should marry only after reaching the age of 18, and boys at or above 22. The village's success has made it a subject of numerous studies. \\"So many Christian and Muslim leaders from all over [Ethiopia's regions] and some from outside have visited the village because it is very famous in its endeavor to eliminate poverty,\\" says Mulgeta Wuletaw, a regional government administrator and member of parliament. Another supporter is Mohammed Mussa, a rural development consultant who prepared a case study on the village for the World Bank. \\"This is an extraordinary initiative within a traditional and conservative community,\\" he says. \\"It's a good example for other Ethiopian communities ‚Äî and even beyond Ethiopia ‚Äî because of its gender equality, its work ethic, and its social security system.\\"\\"In Ethiopia, one man's model for a just society\\", The Christian Science Monitor (accessed 23 Apr 2009) See also * Commune * Cooperation References External links *Rare Earth Episode One Good Cult about Awra Amba, by Evan Hadfield, 2019 *Short Documentary on OneWorldTV about the village *Joumard Robert, 2010.

This farm is used for breeding horses mainly for racing and is the oldest stud farm in India. The history of this farm can be traced back to the times of Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Srirangapatna who used it to breed horses for his cavalry to fight against the British. History The farm was created by Tipu Sultan for breeding horses for his wars in the 1790s. After his death, the farm was used by the British Army to breed horses, mainly Arabian horses for their cavalry regiments. In 1886, the farm also housed Pero Gomez, the first-ever thoroughbred stallion to be imported into India. Subsequently, the horses were also bred for racing and these horses started to challenge the supremacy of horses imported from United Kingdom and Australia as well. The imperial government held control of the farm during the period under the superintendence of Colonel Hay, General Stewart, Colonel McIntire, Colonel A. A. Jones and Colonel R. J. Jones among others. It was then transferred to the Military Department of the Kingdom of Mysore before transferring to the government of Mysore state in 1948. In 1992, the Government of Karnataka leased the farm to the industrialist Vijay Mallya's race horse division of United Racing and Bloodstock Breeders (URBB). Stud Farm The farm is spread across and is divided into 25 paddocks of different sizes. Good pasture is maintained and plants needed for fodder like Alfalfa, Green oats and Rhodes grass are grown here. Training facilities for horses including a riding school is present in the farm. The farm also contains a water purification plant and medical care for horses are provided by veterinarians. Horses Vijay Mallya has imported many stallions from abroad which are housed in the farm. The first stallion to be imported was Bold Russian who had won many races in the United Kingdom and the U.S.. Brave Act and Tejano are other prominent stallions that were imported. Probably, the most famous Indian thoroughbred to emerge from this farm was Adler who remained undefeated in all the nine races that he competed in India. Adler is also the first Indian thoroughbred to win a race in the U.S. The farm also houses some winning broodmares like Littleover, Starfire Girl and Supervite. Saddle Up, a thoroughbred from this farm has won many races in India and also in Singapore and Malaysia. Another famous horse bred in this farm has been Burden of Proof whose progeny has won many races.

He held national records and raced abroad. He later became a coach, manager and administrator. In 2010 he was selected as an ambassador for the 2012 London Olympics. In 2012, aged 91, he was selected to take part in the Olympic torch relay, carrying it through Solihull. Origins Godwin was born in Connecticut, United States to British parents in 1920. The family returned to Britain in 1932. His first bicycle was a Wrenson's delivery bike which he used to run errands for a local grocer. He became interested in cycling because of the 1936 Summer Olympics.The Bicycle, UK, 23 January 1946, p6 Arie van Vliet's riding in the 1,000-metre time-trial inspired him; British amateur champion W. W. Maxfield was also an early hero. Godwin began racing three years later and rode the fastest 1,000m of the season at the Alexander Sports Ground. He was invited to trials in the Midlands to find riders for the next Olympics, despite not yet having won a race. He won a 1,000m at The Butts track in Coventry on 29 July 1939. His chances of Olympic selection ended with the second world war. He envied Reg Harris and Dave Ricketts for being selected for the world championship at a young age, \\"not that I had any claims to such honours but because their good fortune provided them with expert tuition and decent tracks for training. In the Midlands this all seemed so far away.\\" Godwin was an apprentice electrician in a reserved occupation during the war, working for BSA. But there was little competitive cycling and he rode at only 13 meetings between 1940 and the end of 1942. The change in war fortunes meant more sport in Britain from 1943. Godwin was unbeaten in five- mile scratch events and won the Cattlow Trophy at Fallowfield, Manchester, that year and in 1944. In the national championship of 1944, at which Harris made his breakthrough, Godwin won the five-mile. He repeated this success in 1945, adding the 25-mile title which he retained in 1946. In 1949 he won the 4000 metres event. He won the BSA Gold Column, offered by his employers, by winning the five-mile at Herne Hill in south London in 1945. Post-war competition The win at Herne Hill, the first time he had ridden there, \\"must have impressed, for an invitation to ride in Paris came my way,\\" he said in the British weekly, The Bicycle. \\"Being the first international test after cessation of hostilities it was indeed a great honour.\\" At the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, Godwin won two bronze medals, in the team pursuit, with Robert Geldard, Dave Ricketts and Wilfrid Waters, and in the 1,000m time trial. Preparation for the pursuit was hampered by an argument among the coaching staff on the eve of the games, but after a poor performance in the qualifying round, they improved their time by 17 seconds in the subsequent three rounds, winning the bronze in a time faster than the French achieved in the final. He came third in the 1,000m at the 1950 British Empire Games. Career after racing Godwin managed the British cycling team at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, became president of the British Cycling Federation and of the Solihull Cycling Club. He ran the first British training camp in Majorca, Spain, and the first track course at Lilleshall, and founded the Birmingham RCC. He was Britain's first paid national coach and trained a generation of British track riders, many of whom won national and international titles and medals. They included Graham Webb, who beat the British hour record and won the world road race championship, and Mick Bennett, who won bronze medals at the 1972 and 1976 Olympics. From 1936 to 1950, he worked for BSA. For 36 years from 1950 he ran a cycle shop in Silver Street in the Kings Heath district of Birmingham.Tommy Godwin Cycles His autobiography It Wasn't That Easy: The Tommy Godwin Story was published in 2007 by John Pinkerton Memorial Publishing Fund.Association of British Cycling Coaches - Home Page He was president of Solihull Cycling Club.

Professional career =Minor league hockey= Krulicki grew up playing for his hometown Kitchener Greenshirts and Kitchener Rangers of the OHA Junior League. He was a prospect of the New York Rangers and Krulicki was doing his best to get noticed by the parent club. Krulicki recorded back-to-back 20 goal seasons in 1966‚Äì67 and 1967‚Äì68, scoring 25 and 28 goals respectively, for a total of 108 points over those two seasons.

Life  Ganji was born in Tehran, Iran. He received his B.A. and M.A. degrees in political science and international relations from the University of Kentucky, his doctorate degree in international law ‚Äì international protection of human rights ‚Äì from the Graduate Institute of International Studies, University of Geneva, and his postdoctorate degree from the University of Cambridge. Ganji was the Minister of Education of Iran between the years 1976 and 1978. He served as professor of international law and international organizations at Tehran University from 1966 to 1979. He was the founder and the first director of the university's Center for Graduate International Studies (1966‚Äì1971). He served as the dean of Faculty of Law and Political Science of Tehran University (1971‚Äì1974) and he acted as the advisor to the prime minister of Iran, Amir Abbas Hoveida, between 1974 and 1976. Ganji was also the founder of the Iranian Committee for Human Rights, 1967, and its first secretary-general, 1967‚Äì1970. He has written 27 books in Persian, English and French and many articles on the topics of international protection of human rights, civil disobedience and international law.  Human rights activities  Ganji has been a human rights protagonist since his student days in the US, in the 1950s. The subject of his master's degree thesis was the United Nations and human rights, and his PhD dissertation was entitled \\"International Protection of Human Rights\\". Between 1961 and 1962 he served on the secretariat of the International Labour Organization and the division on the Application of the ILO Conventions and Recommendations (in Geneva). He later,1962‚Äì65, worked for the UN Division of Human Rights at the UN Headquarters in New York. At the time of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's reign, Ganji convinced the Shah to invite the International Committee of Red Cross to open up permanent offices in Iran, to visit and inspect Iranian prisons and guarantee that no torture was taking place there.[4] The ICRC offices remained open and active until after the Iranian Revolution, when the ruling clerics closed them down in 1980. Since the Iranian Revolution, Ganji has been active in bringing violations of human rights in Iran by the ruling clerics to the world's attention. Ganji was the first Special Rapporteur for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the question of apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa, including South Africa, South West Africa (now known as Namibia) and Southern Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe), during 1967‚Äì1969. Between 1969 and 1973 Ganji served as the U.N. Special Rapporteur in charge of the preparation of a comprehensive study on conditions of economic, social and cultural rights in all member countries of the United Nations. The U.N. published this global study in 1974 in all its official languages. In 1973 and 1976, Ganji was elected by the UN Commission on Human Rights to serve, in his personal capacity, as a member of the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities (each time for a 3-year term). In 1976 he was also elected by the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to serve a three-year term in his personal capacity as a member of the Committee on Human Rights, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the covenant. To save his life, Ganji hid in Iran and six months after the 1979 revolution escaped Iran on foot into Turkey and from there to the United States. Ganji is the founder and secretary general of the 'Derafsh Kaviani' (the Flag of Freedom Organization of Iran \\"FFO\\"), a democratic non-violent opposition movement to the clerical regime. He is also founder and secretary general of the Organization for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms for Iran whose aims and purposes are educating the Iranian people about their rights and freedoms, demanding their respect by the authorities, and through civil disobedience striving towards the establishment of a free and pluralistic society respectful of human rights, the rule of non- discrimination, separation of church and state and a parliamentary democracy in Iran. Through the Flag of Freedom Organization of Iran and the Organization for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms for Iran, Ganji has been a leading advocate for freedom and human rights in Iran and has orchestrated a campaign of political defiance by advocating civil disobedience against the clerical regime in Iran since the revolution. During the past 30 years, seven attempts have been made against Ganji's life. Seven of his closest colleagues were assassinated in Europe and in the Middle East by the agents of the clerical regime. Many others are said to have been imprisoned, tortured and killed in Iran. Ganji is the author of many books and articles in Persian, English, and French. In addition to his 5 volumes of the United Nations Reports; these include university textbooks on international law and international organizations (four volumes in Persian), international protection of human rights, apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa, Etre Persan (a personal political memoir in French), a study of the developments of the past fifty years in Iran written in Persian, entitled Atash-e Nahofteh (The Hidden Fire ), and Defying the Iranian Revolution: From a Minister to the Shah to a Leader of Resistance.[11]  See also  * Narrated by court  References  *1-Ganji, Manouchehr, Defying the Iranian Revolution (London and Westport, Connecticut : Praeger Publishers, 2002). *2-Ibid ; and Ganji, Manouchehr, Etre Persan ( Paris : Edition Michel Lafon,1995). *3- Ganji, Manouchehr, International Protection of Human Rights ( Geneva : Droz Publishers,1962 ). *4-Ganji, Manouchehr, Defying the Iranian Revolution, Op Cit, p. 43 ; Ganji, Manouchehr Atash-e Nahofteh, Op Cit, PP. 112‚Äì117 and Ganji, Manouchehr, Etre Persan, Op Cit., pp. 36‚Äì40. *5- As examples see : Ganji, Manouchehr, Defying the Iranian Revolution, Op Cit, and Ganji, Manouchehr, Etre Persan, Op.Cit. *6- See : UN Documents E/CN,4/949 (22 November 1967 and UN Document E/CN.4/1108/Rev.1 and E/CN.4/1131/Rev.1 . *7-United Nations, The United Nations and Human Rights (New York: United Nations, 1984), pp. 92‚Äì93. *8-UN, The United Nations and Human Rights (New York: UN Publications, sales No. E.84.I.6), pp. 92‚Äì93 ; Dr. Ganji, Encyclopedia of Britanica, International Human Rights Prescriptions and Enforcement and the UN Document E/cn4/1108/Rev.1 and E/CN.4/1108/Rev.1 .

He was Speaker of the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1710 to 1713 and Secretary of State for the Northern Department from 1713 to 1714. Bromley was a Hanoverian Tory who supported the Hanoverian Succession in 1714. Early life Bromley was the son of Sir William Bromley (died 1682) of Baginton, and his wife Ursula Leigh, daughter of Thomas Leigh, 1st Baron Leigh of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire. He was born at the family seat at Baginton, Warwickshire, and was baptized on 31 August 1663. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1679, and graduated B.A. in 1681 (he was later awarded a D.C.L. in 1702). In 1683, he was admitted as a student of the Middle Temple. Political career Remarks in the Grand Tour of France and Italy, 1705 Bromley missed the Glorious Revolution because he was travelling in France and Italy in 1688, following the death of his first wife in 1688 (he eventually married four times). Upon his return to England he embarked on a political career. Throughout his time in public life Bromley was a staunch high church Tory with a reputation for honesty and extreme partisanship. His political rivals sometimes found it useful to allege Jacobite sympathies and to refer to Bromley's travel memoirs Remarks on the Grand Tour of France and Italy to support that allegation. At the 1690 English general election Bromley was returned as knight of the shire (MP) for Warwickshire. An able debater, his reputation rose rapidly; particularly amongst the Tory squires who shared similar prejudices. In 1696 Bromley refused to take an oath to swear that William III was the rightful and lawful King. As a result, he was incapacitated from serving in Parliament and was not re-elected for Warwickshire in 1698. Bromley returned to Parliament for the strongly High Tory constituency of Oxford University, at a by-election in March 1701. after which Bromley was a leading figure in the Tory ranks. He continued to hold one of the university's two seats for the rest of his life. Bromley was a strong opponent of occasional conformity by religious dissenters, who attended Church of England services often enough to avoid the legal penalties imposed by the Test and Corporation Acts. Bromley promoted several bills to strengthen the law, but they were not adopted. From 1702 to 1705 Bromley was the Chairman of the Committee of Privileges and Elections of the House of Commons. In 1705 he was a candidate for the Speakership. On this occasion a new edition of Bromley's travel memoirs was produced by his political enemies (with an added table pointing the reader to the alleged pro-Catholic and Jacobite passages in the book). Bromley did not become Speaker in 1705. Following the 1710 election there was a large Tory majority in the House of Commons. On 25 November 1710 Bromley was elected Speaker, without opposition. He was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council in 1711. In his position as Speaker in 1713, Bromley responded to questions from a Scottish MP with the infamous reply that \\"they had catcht hold of Scotland, they wou'd keep her fast.\\", thereby given credence to the widely held belief in Scotland that Union was a means for England to assert her dominance over Scotland. Lockhart Papers In 1713 Bromley left the chair of the House to join the administration as Secretary of State for the Northern Department. He lost that office in 1714, when the new King George I installed a Whig ministry. Bromley never held government office again, but he remained the generally recognised leading Tory in the House of Commons until his health declined in the 1720s. Bromley remained an MP until his death in 1732. Family Bromley was married four times: # Catherine Cloberry, daughter of Sir John Cloberry . They had one son: #* Clobery Bromley (1685‚Äì1711) # Trever Fortrey, daughter of Samuel Fortrey, on 21 November 1689. They had no children. # Cecilia Swan, daughter of Sir William Swan, 1st Bt.

It was founded in 1977. Up until the late 1980s, it was a 12-hour channel, switching broadcasts adjacently from one of Emirates Dubai Television's frequencies starting at 2:00 pm, U.A.E. time, with a children's block, and concluding at 2:00 am. The times of the switch often changed usually during Ramadan, which varied each year. It was the only free- to-air English-language channel in Dubai at the time. From the late 1990s, its popularity started dwindling due to availability of alternate channels in English as well as the expat communities native languages via growing use of satellite TV and mainstream cable (E-Vision in 2000). In 2002, it started transmitting over the satellite using Arabsat and Nilesat, and turned into a free-to-air 24-hour channel, even though retaining the children's block timing at 2:00 pm. In 2004, it changed its identity completely and relaunched as Dubai OneEntertainment and Leisure in the United Arab Emirates Retrieved 15 Sept 2010. (after being known as One TV for a short initial period) and is now part of Dubai Media Incorporated. Dubai One managed to recapture some of the lost expat market due to its more U.S.-based premium programming, even though when it was temporarily known as \\"One TV\\", it retained most of Ch33's original programming, including the signature children's block, which was later removed. However, Ch33 had an originality that could never be replaced and is now being copied by other Gulf states expat televisions. Ch33 originally had a habit of changing the type-face of their logo every few years. It originally aired popular and latest US TV Shows, UK Comedy, Horse Racing, daily News and every Thursday 10.00pm, a Hindi movie subtitled in English. Later, its programs became even more diversified to include more soaps from Australia, Canada, etc. The Hindi film ceremony Zee Cine Awards was also shown in February 2004, which took place in Dubai. As with other media in the UAE, all programs on Channel 33 were to be aired after adequate censoring. There was no nudity or other profane content shown on Channel 33. There was also no religious programs aired, unless they were pertaining to Islam. Channel 33 had a teletext service called GULFAX.

It is an erect, woody shrub with pinnate leaves and groups of between three and forty pink flowers arranged in leaf axils. It flowers in spring and early summer and is found in coastal areas between Ballina and Jervis Bay.illustration by Edward Minchen Description Boronia pinnata is an erect, woody shrub that typically grows to a height of about and is glabrous, apart from the flowers. The leaves are pinnate with up to thirteen narrow elliptic to narrow oblong leaflets. The entire leaf is long and wide in outline and the leaflets are mostly long and wide on a petiole long. Between three and twenty, sometimes as many as forty flowers are arranged in groups in the leaf axils. The groups are on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. The four sepals are triangular, long and about wide. The four petals are bright pink, long with a few hairs on the back. The eight stamens have hairy edges. Flowering occurs from September to January and the fruit is a glabrous capsule long. Taxonomy and naming Boronia pinnata was first formally described in 1798 by James Edward Smith who published the description in his book 'Tracts relating to natural history. The specific epithet (pinnata) is a Latin word meaning \\"feathered\\" or \\"plumed\\". This was the only pinnate-leaved species of boronia described by Smith. Distribution and habitat This boronia grows in dry forest and heath on sandstone in near- coastal areas between the Nowra district and Ballina. Use in horticulture One of the easier boronias to grow in gardens, B. pinnata does best in a sheltered position with rocks aiding a shallow root run and it benefits from light pruning.

He was the first chief librarian of the General Assembly Library. Early life Wilson was born in 1857 in Harrogate, Yorkshire, son of John Wilson, a chemist from West Park. He attended Harrogate College and whilst one online biography in addition lists the University of Oxford, other biographies suggest that as a young man, he worked in the woollen trade in Bradford before going to Paris and Lille, aged about 18. He emigrated to New Zealand on the Otaki, which reached Port Chalmers on 24 December 1879. He stayed in Dunedin for a few months and then accepted a position as assistant master at Te Aro School in Wellington. In 1882, he joined the staff at the Wanganui Collegiate School, where he worked for three or four years. He then had a career change and worked as a journalist. His first job was as a sub- editor at the Wanganui Chronicle in Wanganui, with subsequent employment by the Gisborne Standard in Gisborne, and the Evening News in Napier. He then founded and edited the Marton Mercury in Marton, a small settlement southeast of Wanganui. In 1892, he became editor of the New Zealand Mail, which was a newspaper with a leaning towards the Liberal Party. On 2 June 1894, Wilson married Lucilla Naomi Carter of Pauatahanui. Political career Wilson was one of nine candidates in the three-member electorate in the , where he came fifth. Thomas Wilford of the Liberal Party won the Wellington Suburbs seat in the 1896 election, but he was declared guilty of corrupt practices after an electoral petition (probably because he exceeded the ¬£200 spending limit which had been introduced at that election) and the election was declared void. At the subsequent by-election in 1897, Wilson won the seat for the Liberals. One of his obituaries mentions that at Wanganui Collegiate, Wilford had been Wilson's pupil, but Wilford's Dictionary of New Zealand Biography entry lists schools other than Wanganui Collegiate. Wilson retired in 1899 when the next general election was held, and Wilford won the seat back on behalf of the Liberal Party. Librarian Wellington Parliamentary Library building from 1899 In 1901, Wilson was appointed the first chief librarian of the parliamentary library. This was not uncontroversial and was seen as reward by the Liberal Government for his services to the Liberal Party. One of his first tasks was to oversee the move of the library into newly constructed premises. The building was designed by Thomas Turnbull, who specialised in making buildings earthquake- and fire-proof. Wilson was concerned about having had the library built next to the \\"tinder dry\\" Parliament Buildings. He initiated further fireproofing measures like having windows closed with bricks and having iron doors installed. His concerns proved justified, as on 11 December 1907, the Parliament Building burned down. Whilst the roof of the library was destroyed and the main entrance and foyer were damaged, the collection survived the fire. Wilson was friends with Harold Beauchamp, and for this reason, Beauchamp's daughter Kathleen was allowed to use the parliamentary library as \\"a welcome retreat from ... the crass colonial life of Wellington\\". She was later to become famous under her pen name, Katherine Mansfield. As a bibliophile with his own private collection, Wilson had a traditional approach to his librarianship role and concentrated on expanding the parliamentary library. In 1918 the library received the bequest to the New Zealand government from Alexander Turnbull, who had constituted the largest private library in the country consisting of \\"55,000 volumes of books, pamphlets, periodicals and newspapers, and thousands of maps, paintings, drawings, prints and manuscripts\\". The government purchased Turnbull's home to house the Turnbull collection, and put Wilson in charge of transferring the collection to the nation, and appointed him as supervisor for the further development of the collection. Wilson retired as a librarian in 1926 following an illness and was succeeded in that role by Guy Scholefield. Other activities Wilson was a member of the Yorkshire Society, including its vice-president. He was one of the founders of the Savage Club in Wellington. Wilson was a member of the Academy of Fine Arts, and at one point was the president of the society's council. Wilson was a member of the original council of Victoria University College and its chairman for two years. Upon his retirement as a librarian, he and his wife embarked on an eight-month trip around the world that took in France, Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland; there he attended the World's Press Union Conference in Geneva as New Zealand's representative. =Bibliography= Wilson regularly provided book reviews to newspapers, and his style of writing was described by the Auckland Star as \\"very pleasant, gossipy\\". He published several books, which were collections of book review essays: Death On 5 February 1932, Wilson ran to catch the Wellington Cable Car. He tripped and hit his head on a kerb, and was taken to the Bowen Street hospital. He had lost consciousness and died four days later. Wilson was buried at Karori Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and one daughter.

Biography Kazys Lozoraitis was born into a family of diplomat and politician Stasys Lozoraitis in Berlin in 1929. In 1933, he moved with his family to Lithuania. Soon afterwards, his father was appointed to a new position in Italy, and the family moved to Rome. In Rome, he finished gymnasium (preparatory school) and then studied journalism at the Sapienza University of Rome. He worked for over ten years at Radio Italia, and began working for Radio Vatican in 1972. In 1960, he was appointed secretary of the chief of the Lithuanian diplomatic service in exile, as Lithuania was then occupied by the Soviet Union. Between 1985 and 1992 he served as Head of the Chancellery of Lithuanian Representation to the Holy See; after 1980 he served as vice-chairman of the Italian Lithuanian Community. In 1992, Lozoraitis was accredited as the Lithuanian Ambassador to the Holy See; two years later he was named Lithuanian Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Order of Malta, becoming the first person to hold these positions after the re- establishment of Lithuania's independence in 1990.

Cooney's young adult novel Both Sides of Time, and is the second book in the Time Travelers Quartet.  Plot Overview Annie Lockwood is going on a school field trip to New York City one year after she has returned to her time in 1995 after meeting Strat. While in New York, she slips back one hundred years into the past, to discover her one true love, Strat, has been put into an insane asylum. Annie learn from Strat's younger sister Devonny that Strat's current predicament is because he continued to insist that Annie was real, even though she mysteriously disappeared and everyone else decided to forget her existence. Annie decides to save Strat and prove that she is real and could travel through time. Annie also learns that Strat's betrothed, his childhood friend Harriet, is suffering from consumption. Annie disguises herself as Devonny and manages to get past obstacles that were in the way, especially Walker Walkley, Strat's former best friend and now antagonist of the book. The two reunite and narrowly escape Walkley, who plans to take over the Stratton fortune. Annie has second thoughts about Strat being with Harriet when she died, mainly because she knew Harriet loved Strat and was betrothed to him and Strat adored her. Strat later explains to Annie that she must go back to her own time and he must stay, no matter how much they love each other. Strat says he would go to Mexico, along with his friends at the insane asylum. Charlie, one of Harriet's close friends and who loved Harriet, noticed Annie getting kidnapped by Walkley, so he shoots him. Annie is then whisked back to her proper time soon afterwards.

National Science Teachers Association In 2005-2006 he was president of the National Science Teachers Association. Padilla is well known to the international science education community and engaged in a cooperative research project with Japanese scholars on Japanese education. The theme of his presidency was \\"Developing a World View for Science Education.\\"[3] When President George W. Bush suggested teaching Intelligent design in classrooms, then NSTA president Padilla replied: \\"It is simply not fair to present pseudoscience to students in the science classroom,\\" and that \\"Nonscientific viewpoints have little value in increasing students' knowledge of the natural world.\\"[4] He remains active with NSTA through several international and national efforts..[5] He helped develop the National Science Education Standards, released in 1995, contributed to the review of the Next Generation Science Standards, released in 2013, and has written extensively about science education, including many articles, books and book chapters.[3] With Pearson, Dr. Padilla has been a lead author on these titles:'' Prentice Hall Science Explorer, has been the nation's leading middle school science program through 2011, and is still considered an exceptional fit for today's classroom. Lead author Michael Padilla weaves together content with hands-on science inquiry that's sure to reach every student. By making the program available in 16 small books or as the Life, Earth, and Physical series, teachers have found customization and curricular options to better match local standards, scope and sequence, and divergent teaching styles. Interactive Science is a comprehensive K-8 science program,that utilizes the practices in science instruction, featuring the Understanding by Design learning framework, the 5-E Instructional Model, and an emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), as well as 21st Century skills.[1] Written by an influential team of scientists and science educators, the Interactive Science program is based on research and effective pedagogy. This ground-breaking program: :* Employs a distinct and unique student experience - an interactive write in student text. This allows students a medium to process information while they are learning it, to focus on key reading, writing, and communication skills in perfect partnership with science content. :* Offers multiple pathways to learning that is also unprecedented with informal, formal, STEM, and activity-centric learning to ensure a key focus on inquiry at every stage of instruction. :* Ensures all students can learn with a robust digital component - the Digital Path - that both mirrors and extends the core instruction through interactive media, videos, virtual labs, and an online \\"kinesthetic\\" that requires students to be active, participatory learners and not simply \\"press play.\\" Resources * Prentice Hall Science Explorer (books). * PHSchool Website Footnotes American education writers University of Georgia faculty University of Detroit Mercy alumni Wayne State University alumni Michigan State University alumni Clemson University faculty Living people Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Michael J.

WDYZ's transmitter is off Charles Street in Longwood.Radio- Locator.com/WDYZ The station uses a three-tower array. It is powered with 3,500 watts by day. But because AM 660 is a clear channel frequency reserved for WFAN in New York City, WDYZ must reduce power to 1,000 watts at night. The station uses a directional antenna at all times.

WGOR was a daytimer, powered with 10,000 watts but required to go off the air at night. It carried a Christian radio format. In the 1990s, the station was acquired by Floyco, Inc.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-85 It changed its call sign to WORL to represent Orlando. It moved one spot up the dial to AM 660 and changed its city of license to Altamonte Springs. The move was designed to allow the station to broadcast around the clock, which was not possible when it was on AM 650, due to its proximity to WSM Nashville, the 50,000 watt clear channel station on 650 kHz. In 2001, WORL was acquired by James Crystal, Inc., which also owned stations in the Miami and West Palm Beach radio markets. Crystal programmed a mix of talk, business news and religion. But the company ran into financial problems several years later. In 2006, Salem Media acquired the station, to air its own lineup of conservative talk programming.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2010 page D-131 In July 2019, it was announced that JVC Broadcasting, owners of country station WOTW, would acquire WORL and its FM translator for $900,000. Salem moved the conservative talk format to WTLN 950 on August 19, 2019, and the station carried a looping promo redirecting listeners to the station. As Salem retained rights to the WORL calls, the WDYZ calls from a sister station were swapped to WORL. JVC announced that it planned to launch a new hot talk format on the station, Florida Man Radio, which officially launched on September 9, featuring hosts like Bubba the Love Sponge, Scott Ledger, and The Shannon Burke Show (which had been displaced by WYAY in Atlanta after its sale and conversion to K-Love). In November 2019, JVC announced plans to syndicate the Florida Man Radio programming state-wide, adding Gainesville sister station WYGC to the network beginning November 11, 2019.

Noam Sheizaf, a co- founder and the +972 chief executive officer, said they wanted to express a new \\"and mostly young voice which would take part in the international debate regarding Israel and Palestine\\". They named the website in reference to the 972 international dialing code, which is shared by Israel and the Palestinian territories. The articles are written mostly in English to reach an international audience. History, goals, management structure +972 was founded in August 2010 by Lisa Goldman, Ami Kaufman, Dimi Reider, and Noam Sheizaf, four working journalists in Tel Aviv who met and decided to create a shared internet platform; they already each had blogs and shared progressive views, including opposition to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. Sarah Wildman, writing in The Nation, described +972 as > \\"Born in the summer of 2010 as an umbrella outfit for a group of (mostly) > pre-existing blogs. ... The site is now an online home for more than a dozen > writers, a mix of Israelis, binational American- and Canadian-Israelis, and > two Palestinians, all of whom occupy, if you'll forgive the term, space on > the spectrum of the left.\\" By January 2012 about 15 journalists were affiliated with +972, and most wrote in English for a largely American audience. +972 has a horizontal, collaborative organizational structure. Proposed new members are \\"voted on by the group and can be rejected\\". The collaborative hires and fires the editor, who does not have authority to hire or fire members. The website has an \\"unorthodox journalistic ethos: All the website's bloggers have complete freedom to write whenever and whatever they want\\". According to The Nation, editors do not make assignments: > \\"There is no hierarchy. Two rotating editors [recently changed to one > editor] copy-edit and do a light legal sweep on each story. ... If they see > something that needs to be changed for legal reasons, they'll notify the > writer before making the change.\\" According to Leibovitz, \\"the magazine's reported pieces ... adhere to sound journalistic practices of news gathering and unbiased reporting.\\" Its commentary and essays, like its members, are dedicated \\"to promoting a progressive worldview of Israeli politics, advocating an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, and protecting human and civil rights in Israel and Palestine\\"; they \\"support specific causes and are aimed at social and political change\\". Sarah Wildman, writing in The Nation in early 2012, says the magazine is \\"purposefully, uniformly progressive\\". According to Leibovitz, +972 reporters are well-positioned to report from the West Bank. Several members of the cooperative are \\"frequent participants in joint Israeli- Palestinian demonstrations behind the Green Line\\", and work closely with \\"the activists who coordinate such protests\\". Funding The magazine is largely financed by reader contributions. In addition, the Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation, a German think-tank affiliated with the German Green Party, provided 6,000 euros in first-year funding in 2010. It continues to provide some funds. According to The Nation, the Social Justice Fund at the New Israel Fund granted +972 $10,000 in the first year, and made a one-year grant of $60,000 in early 2012. =Readers= The website's staff asserts that the vast majority of +972s readers live outside Israel, with about 40% in the United States and 20% in the Palestinian territories. According to CEO Noam Sheizaf, about 20% of its readers are Israeli. Israeli leftists Akiva Eldar and Merav Michaeli told The Nation that Israelis have never heard of +972, Michaeli describing it as simply \\"not relevant\\" to Israeli politics. Criticism According to The Nation, writers for the left-wing newspaper Haaretz and left-wing Israeli intellectuals have criticized the new web magazine. The pro-Israel organization NGO Monitor accused +972 of being antisemitic for applying the apartheid analogy regarding Israel's treatment of Palestinians. Noam Sheizaf said: \\"The attack on +972 is being carried out in the standard way NGO Monitor, Im Tirzu and similar organizations work these days: Not by debating the content of our reports and commentary pieces, but by trying to delegitimize and silence us.\\" In February 2012, Sheizaf said \\"Jewish American liberals are not on our side. [Most Americans] will only support my liberalism to a certain degree. When I fight for the right of an Arab woman to become a doctor, you will stand by and donate to the New Israel Fund. But if I say 'Jerusalem is an apartheid city,' which it is‚ÄîJerusalem is the worst place in the world in terms of citizenship laws‚ÄîAmerican liberals get goosebumps.\\" References External links * Israeli political websites Left-wing politics in Israel Mass media in Tel Aviv Non-Hebrew-language mass media in Israel ","title":"+972 Magazine"},{"id":"12890465","text":"Penny Cula-Reid (born 2 February 1988) is an Australian rules footballer who played for the Collingwood Football Club in the AFL Women's competition.

Biography  = Early life = Charles was the second son of Shuckburgh Boughton of Poston Court Hereford and Mary Greville (20 December 1713 ‚Äì 1 March 1786), daughter of Hon. Algernon Greville, and Hon. Mary Somerset, daughter of Lord Arthur Somerset (1671‚Äì1743), son of Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort. He went to India as a writer in 1765 and held several judicial and administrative offices in the service of the East India Company. He was at various times a Persian interpreter and senior merchant and judge. During his time in India, he inherited an estate at Rouse Lench, Worcestershire by the will of Thomas Phillips Rouse. He left the East India Company and after returning to England in 1778, stood for Parliament at Evesham in 1780, where he was elected as one of the members after a hard-fought battle. His main interest in politics was India, and the speeches which he made between 1780 and 1790 all dealt with Indian affairs. In 1784 he was appointed Secretary to the Board of Control for India and held the post until 1791. He opposed the impeachment of Warren Hastings. = Later life = Charles did not contest the 1790 election and left Parliament. He assumed the name of Rouse by Royal Licence in 1791 and was created 1st Baronet Boughton Rouse. In 1794 he inherited the title 9th Baronet of Langford and changed his surname to Rouse Boughton. At the general election in 1796 he was returned unopposed at Bramber, a notorious Rotten borough, where an agreement had operated since 1774, by which the two owners of the \`miserable thatched cottages' who had the right to vote at Bramber returned a member each. In the new Parliament, he spoke several times on Indian affairs. He vacated his seat in 1800 when he was appointed an Audit Commissioner, a post he held until his death in 1821.  Family  He married Catherine Pearce Hall, the daughter of William Pearce Hall and his wife Catherine Comyn, in 1781. Catherine was the heiress of the Downton estates near Ludlow, including Downton Hall. This was fortunate for Charles since his brother Edward had bequeathed the Boughton estates to Elisabeth Davis, his natural daughter by a serving maid, who later married baronet George Braithwaite. Catherine enhanced the estate at Downton, planting High Grove, or Catherine's Grove, and her portrait was painted by Romney in 1785. Charles was interested in agriculture and was renowned for his remarkable pig. In London, he lived at Corney House Chiswick. Charles' son William inherited the baronetcy and his daughter Louise (1785 ‚Äì 9 July 1860) married firstly St Andrew St John, 14th Baron St John of Bletso and secondly Sir John Vaughan. In the programme Who Do You Think You Are? (transmitted on BBC2 on 23 August 2010), comedian Alexander Armstrong discovered that his mother is a descendant through Louise's first marriage to Baron St John.

Background Edouarde was born in Cleveland, Ohio to an Irish-American family on 31 October 1875. Studying violin at an early age, he finished his education in Europe. He graduated from the Royal Conservatory of Leipzig in 1899 and returned to the United States that year with Allessandro Liberati's band as a virtuoso violinist. Shortly thereafter, Edouarde taught at the Cleveland Conservatory of Music as professor of harmony and theory. He left the Conservatory several years later to become the leader of Knapp's Millionaire Band, and soon thereafter reorganized the group as the Carl Edouarde Concert Band in New York City. Rothafel originally hired the services of Edouarde at the Regent Theatre in New York in 1912. When Rothafel opened the Strand Theatre in 1914, he appointed Edouarde as the lead conductor, a position he would hold for fifteen years. Edouarde compiled photoplay music into scores for features at the Strand regularly, including The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film) and The Private Life of Helen of Troy (1927). In 1927, Edouarde left the Strand in order to work in the field of synchronizing musical scores to sound film. During this time, he synchronized several films for Pathe, including A Close Call, Barnyard Melody and Tuning In. On December 10, 1929, during the production of a musical short, the Pathe Studio in New York caught fire, killing several people. Edouarde survived from leaping from a second-story window, but broke his ankle enough that it effectively ended his career as a conductor.

Made with Dijon mustard, onions, lemon juice, olives and scotch bonnet peppers West African cuisine encompasses a diverse range of foods that are split between its 16 countries. In West Africa, many families grow and raise their own food, and within each there is a division of labor. Indigenous foods consist of a number of plant species and animals, and are important to those whose lifestyle depends on farming and hunting. The history of West Africa also plays a large role in their cuisine and recipes, as interactions with different cultures (particularly the Arab world and later Europeans) over the centuries have introduced many ingredients that would go on to become key components of the various national cuisines today.  History  Centuries later, the Portuguese, French and British further influenced regional cuisines, but only to a limited extent. However, it was European explorers and traders who brought chili peppers, corn and tomatoes from the New World, and both have become ubiquitous components of West African cuisines, along with peanuts, cassava, and plantains. In turn, these slave ships carried African ingredients to the New World, including black-eyed peas and okra. Around the time of the colonial period, particularly during the Scramble for Africa, the European settlers defined colonial borders without regard to pre-existing borders, territories or cultural differences. This bisected tribes and created colonies with varying culinary styles. As a result, it is difficult to sharply define, for example, Senegalese cuisine. Although the European colonists brought many new ingredients to the African continent, they had relatively little impact on the way people cook in West Africa. Its strong culinary tradition lives on despite the influence of colonization and food migration that occurred long ago.  Ingredients  Klouikloui, rings of fried peanut butter as served in Benin Though there are obvious differences among the local cuisines in West Africa, there are also many commonalities, mainly in the ingredients used. Many dishes are enriched with a base of tomatoes, onions and chili peppers. Considered an essential and even \\"sacred\\" cooking technique in the region, the combination of these three ingredients sauteed in oil is analogous to similar concepts such as the holy trinity of Cajun and Creole cooking in the United States, sofrito used in the Spanish-speaking world, soffritto in Italy, and the mirepoix of France. The most prevalent cooking oil is palm nut oil, traditionally associated with the coastal regions and contributes a distinctive colour, flavour and texture to food, while shea butter is more commonly used in the Sahel. Called karit√© in French, which comes from the Arabic word ghartƒ´, it is prized for the rich mouthfeel it imparts. There are certain ingredients that go with certain countries as well. In Ghana, the most commonly used ingredients are hot pepper, ginger, and maize. Ghanaians use hot pepper because they believe the hot peppers will cool the body and cleanse/purify it. (Salm, 106-108). In Senegal, the main ingredients are among many others gumbo, hot pepper, rice, millet, peanut, ginger, tamarind leaves, and baobab fruit, and cooking oil (Ross, 75). Those are the few that have a slight difference of what they commonly use for their dishes. For an overall view of West Africa, according to Fran Osseo-Asare, the common ingredients for the West African region are the leaves from a baobab tree, cereal grains: sorghum, millet, and fonio, Cola nuts, egusi seeds, guinea fowl, melegueta pepper, oil palm, okra, and rice. Other ingredients used are okra (thickener)basis for soups stew, black-eyed peas, and sesame according to Harris in High on the Hog. = Seasonings = Spices play a relatively less prominent role in West African cooking compared to say, North African cuisine. Cooks use spices and herbs like ginger, coriander, and thyme sparingly but knowingly. Chilli peppers however are immensely loved in West Africa, both in fresh or dried and powdered form, particularly in the more hot-and-humid lands of the region. Introduced to Africa probably sometime soon after Christopher Columbus sailed to America by European sailors, it is said that the sweating induced by the spicy heat of chilli helps to air-conditions your skin. More than in other regions of Africa, West Africans utilize Scotch bonnet chile peppers with a liberal hand in many of their sauces and stews. The bite and fire of these extremely hot peppers (Scoville rating 200,000 ‚Äì 300,000) add a unique flavor as well as heat. The chilli is also supposed to help preserve food, as well as adding flavour to relatively bland tropical staples like root vegetables. The seeds of Guinea pepper (Aframomum melegueta; also called grains of paradise or melagueta pepper), a plant indigenous to West Africa, are also widely used. This native spice tastes and looks somewhat like a peppercorn, but has cardamom and coriander seed flavor notes. The grains of paradise was once a prized commodity reaching Europe through North African middlemen, during the Middle Ages. Sumbala or soumbala is a flavouring used widely across West Africa, used in a manner not unlike a bouillon cube. It is usually prepared by women over the course of several days, traditionally from n√©r√© (Parkia biglobosa) seeds. It can be made from other kinds of seeds, and the use of soybeans for this purpose is increasing due mainly to inadequate supply of n√©r√© seeds. The fabrication process involves boiling, cleaning and then packing away to ferment ‚Äì the fermentation process giving it a pungent smell and at the same time a rich, deep umami or savory flavour is developed. Salt can be added to the finished product to facilitate storage life. This condiment is traditionally sold in balls or patties that can be kept for several months at a time in the case of the best quality. It is a traditional cooking ingredient used across West Africa, although the less traditional bouillon cube, specifically the Maggi brand rivals it in popularity. African potash (potassium carbonate) is a native salt used for flavoring and to expedite the cooking time for some foods by cooks, it is made from wood-fire ashes in an ancient process that was once used by pioneer settlers in North America. = Vegetables = Vegetables are a part of any West African meal. Some commonly eaten vegetables include black-eyed peas, eggplant, pumpkin and other squashes, okra, as well as a staggering variety of both farmed and foraged green leafy vegetables, little known or used outside of the African continent. Baobab leaves, pumpkin leaves, rosella leaves, sweet potato leaves, and cassava leaves (which contain cyanide in their raw state, and are always blanched with boiling water before use to remove the toxins) are just some of the greens that are commonplace in a West African kitchen. Black-eyed peas form the basis for a popular fried snack, the well-loved akara fritter. Starchy tubers and root vegetables are used as staple food, to be served with their meat and vegetable dishes, often as a foil to the hotness of the peppers. Cassava, cocoyams, sweet potatoes, plantains, and yams are ubiquitous in the local diet, and they are usually boiled and then pounded with a pestle and mortar into a thick starchy paste called fufu. Other starch staples eaten throughout West Africa besides root vegetables and tubers include fonio, rice, millet, sorghum, and maize. = Meat = Although West Africans ate far more vegetables and much less meat in the past, today their diet is heavier in meats, salt, and fats. Seafood is especially popular along the coast and many dishes combine both fish and meat. Seafood is one of the most common protein sources in West Africa. Seafood is so prevalent in this region that this industry even accounts for a quarter of the workforce. Dried and smoked fish flavor a number of sauces, stews, and other dishes, including condiments, in much the same way that anchovies and bacon flavour food in a number of other cuisines. It is often flaked and fried in oil, and sometimes cooked in sauce made with the base of hot peppers, onions and tomatoes, various spices (such as soumbala) and water to produce an incredible combination of subtle flavors. Chicken is eaten nearly everywhere and chicken eggs are a common food and source of protein. Guinea Fowl eggs also popular. In some inland areas, beef, pork and mutton are preferred, with goat meat being the dominant red meat. Suya, a popular grilled spicy meat kebab flavored with peanuts and other spices, is sold by street vendors as a tasty snack or evening meal and is typically made with beef or chicken.  Representative dishes  Some dishes are a prevalent feature in most West African societies, but bearing different names in different locales. = Fufu = A plate of fufu accompanied with peanut soup As above, fufu is usually made from cassava, yams, and sometimes combined with cocoyam, plantains, or cornmeal. In Ghana, fufu is mostly made from boiled cassava and unripe plantain beaten together, as well as from cocoyam. Currently, these products have been made into powder/flour and can be mixed with hot water to obtain the final product hence eliminating the arduous task of beating it in a mortar with a pestle until a desired consistency is reached. Fufu can also be made from semolina, rice, or even instant potato flakes. Often, the dish is still made by traditional methods: pounding and the base substance in a mortar with a wooden spoon. In contexts where poverty is not an issue, or where modern appliances are readily available, a food processor may also be used. In Western and Central Africa, the more common method is to serve a mound of fufu along with a soup (·ªçb·∫π). After washing hands, the diner pinches off a small ball of fufu and makes an indentation with the thumb. This reservoir is then filled with soup, and the ball is eaten. In Nigeria and Ghana, the ball is often not chewed but swallowed whole ‚Äì in fact, chewing fufu is considered a faux pas. Therefore, fufu not only serves as a food but also as a utensil. One of the low points of Fufu was the smell which lingers on long after the meal, however new and improved species of cassava and improved cassava processing has eliminated the smell of Fufu making it more accepted as a meal. A selection of soups that could be served with fufu includes but not limited to: light (tomato) soup, Palm Nut Soup, groundnut soup, peppersoup, and other types of soups with vegetables such as okra, nkontomire (cocoyam leaves). Soups are often made with different kinds of meat and fish, fresh or smoked. = Groundnut stew = Maafe, prepared by a Senegalese cook. Groundnut stew (maafe), (var. maf√©, maff√©, maffe, sauce d'arachide, tigad√®gu√®na or tigadene), is a peanut-based stew common to much of West Africa, and very popular in Senegal, the Gambia, Mali, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire. Variants of maafe appear in the cuisine of nations throughout West Africa and Central Africa. With the significant expansion of groundnut cultivation during the colonial period, maafe has become a popular dish across West Africa, and as far east as Cameroon. Recipes for the stew vary widely, but groundnut stew at its core is cooked with a sauce based on groundnuts (peanuts), the West African trinity of tomatoes, onion and chillies, and common protein components are mutton, beef or chicken. In the coastal regions of Senegal, maafe is frequently made with fish. Maafe is traditionally served with white rice (in Senegambia), couscous (as West Africa meets the Sahara) or fufu and sweet potatoes in the more tropical areas.Um'bido (greens & Peanuts) Recipe Ghanaian Maafe: My Changing Memories of Mafe = Jollof rice = Jollof rice Jollof rice, also called Benachin is a popular dish all over West Africa. It originated in Senegal but has since spread to the whole of West Africa, especially Nigeria and Ghana amongst members of the Wolof ethnic group, from whom the word \\"jollof\\" originated. There are many variations of Jollof Rice. The most common basic ingredients are: rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, onion, salt, and red pepper. Beyond that, nearly any kind of meat, vegetable, or spice can be added. The Senegalese version of jollof rice is a bit different and is called Ceebu Jen. It is the national dish of Senegal. A variation, \\"thiebou yapp,\\" or \\"rice meat\\" is made with beef, mutton or other red meat.

Beer from millet is also common, and popular.  Etiquette  Dining is communal, and diners would use their fingers to eat.

Born in Leeds and currently living in Gateshead, he is the founding principal of Gateshead Jewish Academy for Girls. Biography His works were first published weekly for years in the English edition of the chareidi Litvish newspaper Yated Ne'eman, under the pseudonym Tuvia Cohen in columns explaining and observing nature through popular science with a creationist perspective, and was later published by Feldheim Publishers and ArtScroll in three separate books: # Designer World # Our Amazing World # Our Wondrous World He credits his works by being inspired through his mentor the late Rabbi Avigdor Miller.In the Acknowledgments of his 3 books He begins each chapter with a look at a familiar everyday or interesting worldly phenomenon or a quirk of human nature and presents it with classic anecdotal and dry British wit. Then he takes the reader to a closer look, using his foreword as a stepping stone and analogy to the broader scientific subject, presenting the deep wisdom of plan and purpose in every single minute detail of creation and life. Every chapter looks at a different issue, from the animal kingdom to the plant world, and from the vast universe of cosmos to the functions and details of the human body and physique. Katz takes his readers behind the scenes of nature and shows the hand and wisdom of a planner, designer and facilitator, through scientific facts and explanations. Rabbi Matisyohu Salomon the spiritual leader of Lakewood Jewish community and his acquaintance from his native Gateshead, writes that \\"the works of Rabbi Katz is [sic] an updated Sha'ar Habechina,\\"in the haskama (preface-blessing) to the book Our Wondrous World meaning that this style and form of teaching to make people aware of the wonders of nature was first done by the Chovot ha-Levavot, which is now very primitive and outdated form of science, mainly in his second chapter, Sha'ar HaBechina.

The organization's mission is to produce and present art that enriches and empowers Asian Pacific American communities. Notable participants include author and Asian American studies scholar Russell Leong, playwright and author Jessica Hagedorn, author Janice Mirikitani, poet and historian Al Robles, and actor and filmmaker Lane Nishikawa.  History  = Origins = Kearny Street Workshop was founded as an artists' collective in 1972 in the International Hotel (I-Hotel) on San Francisco's Kearny Street. The founders Jim Dong, Lora Joh Foo, and Mike Chin and other early leaders were involved in the Asian American movement, a Civil Rights Movement-inspired period of organizational and community building in the 1970s. The National Endowment for the Arts provided some initial funding through the Neighborhood Arts Program (NAP), an initiative of the San Francisco Arts Commission. Though the founders were initially distrustful of government funds, NAP liaison Bernice Bing and founder Jim Dong eventually agreed to use a $2,000 NAP grant to fund a graphics workshop for KSW participants. In its early days, KSW shared space with a dry goods store on the ground floor of the I-Hotel. The organization originally focused on cultivating Chinese American arts and activism. However, the organization quickly expanded to cater to a multiethnic constituency, holding classes for Asian American activists and artists to practice photography, creative writing, and silkscreen printing. Within the first few years, hundreds of Bay-area students were attending classes, salons, workshops, and exhibitions each day. KSW also opened Jackson Street Gallery in an adjacent I-Hotel storefront space in 1974, where Workshop members held exhibitions, poetry readings, and musical performances. = Community activism = KSW played a key role in developing Asian American activist iconography during the I-Hotel anti-eviction movement. Students and other KSW members painted a block-long mural on the Jackson Street side of the I-Hotel in support of its tenants. Screenprinted posters advocating for the I-Hotel tenants' rights appeared throughout San Francisco's Chinatown, Manilatown, and Japantown during the decade-long fight for the I-Hotel. Artists from KSW also aided in the anti-eviction protests by organizing rallies, attending court hearings, hosting exhibitions on affordable housing, and publishing poetry and pamphlets that depicted life in the I-Hotel. KSW also provided summer youth programming that was intended to provide a diversion from gang violence in Chinatown. Workshop members also spearheaded the development of the annual Hop Jok Fair, which not only promoted Asian American artwork, but introduced many low-income Chinatown residents to available social and health services. = Eviction and relocation = In 1977, both residential and business tenants were evicted from the I-Hotel. The workshop's headquarters relocated to a small storefront in North Beach, San Francisco. However, this relocation separated the organization from its key communities and constituents in Chinatown and Manilatown. KSW was able to return to Chinatown by 1981, leasing a basement space in a hotel on Clay Street. During its time in this space, members organized the Asian American Jazz Festival as well as the Kearny Street Workshop Press. In 1995, KSW was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and relocated to South Park, San Francisco. KSW finally relocated to a gallery and performance space in San Francisco's SoMa in 2006.  Programs and exhibitions  KSW's past and present programs include a small poetry press, writers' workshops, visual arts, martial arts, readings, music, gallery exhibitions, performances, and film screenings, as well as the Asian American Jazz Festival and the annual artists festival APAture. = Kearny Street Workshop Press = KSW's press published poetry by Bay-area Asian American authors such as Virginia Cerenio, Bob Hsiang, Jaime Jacinto, Genny Lim, Lenny Limjoco, and Jeff Tagami. = Asian American Jazz Festival = KSW founded the Asian American Jazz Festival (AAJF) in 1981, with the help of organizers and KSW members George Leong and Paul Yamazaki. Until it ceased production in 2006, the AAJF was the longest continuously-running jazz festival in the San Francisco area. Notable participants include Mark Izu, Fred Ho, Vijay Iyer, and Jin Hi Kim. = APAture = APAture is an annual multidisciplinary arts festival founded in 1999. Its mission is to promote emerging Bay-Area-based artists of Asian and/or Pacific Islander descent. Notable participants include Gene Luen Yang, Ali Wong, Hasan Minhaj, Jane Kim, and Goh Nakamura.

Coffin).  Early Life  He attended the Boys' Central High School in Philadelphia and was a student of Elihu Thomson. Rice graduated in 1880 and considered going to Yale but decided to join Thomson in New Britain, Connecticut, at the American Electric Company as Thomson's assistant at $30 a month.  Career  In 1883 he continued with Thomson, and moved from New Britain to Lynn, Massachusetts, to work for the newly formed Thomson-Houston Electric Company. There he worked on converting Thomson's inventions into manufactured products. In 1885 he became the factory superintendent when John Meech moved to Europe to head up Thomson-Houston International. Under Rice the Lynn factory grew from almost nothing in 1883 to an enterprise with $10 million in sales and 4,000 employees in 1892. Primary products included arc light systems, electrical generators, dynamos, meters, transformers, and electric motors. By 1892 the primary products were electric trolley car systems and the company had built over 2700 electric trolley cars and 870 electric generator stations. The entire factory reported to Rice and in 1890 supervisors who reported to him included D. M. Barton - Production Manager, I. F. Baker - Mechanical Superintendent, G. E. Emmons - Factory Auditor, W. H. Knight - Chef Electrical Engineer, and A. I. Rohrer - Chef Assistant. In 1892 General Electric Company was created after a merger with Edison General Electric. Rice was originally its technical director. He became, in 1896, vice president in charge of manufacturing and engineering, and eventually senior vice president.

It forms the first part of his pairing of 'Lulu' plays; the second is Pandora's Box (1904), both depicting a society \\"riven by the demands of lust and greed\\".Article \\"Frank Wedekind\\" in Banham 1998, pp. 1189-1190). In German folklore an erdgeist is a gnome, first described in Goethe's Faust (1808). Together with Pandora's Box, Wedekind's play formed the basis for the silent film Pandora's Box (1929) starring Louise Brooks and the opera Lulu by Alban Berg (1935, premiered posthumously in 1937). In the original manuscript, dating from 1894, the ‚ÄòLulu‚Äô drama was in five acts and subtitled ‚ÄòA Monster Tragedy‚Äô. Wedekind subsequently divided the work into two plays: Earth Spirit (German: Erdgeist, first printed 1895) and Pandora‚Äôs Box (German: Die B√ºchse der Pandora, first performed 1904). The premiere of Earth Spirit took place in Leipzig on 25 February 1898, in a production by Carl Heine, with Wedekind himself in the role of Dr Sch√∂n. Wedekind is known to have taken his inspiration from at least two sources: the pantomime Lulu by F√©licien Champsaur, which he saw in Paris in the early 1890s, and the sex murders of Jack the Ripper in London in 1888.Finney 1989, p. 80 The Lulu character may also have been partially inspired by the famed dancer/courtesan Lola Montez, also a woman of humble origin who fabricated an exotic identity. Plot In a Prologue, the characters in the drama are introduced by an ‚ÄòAnimal Tamer‚Äô as if they are creatures in a travelling circus. Lulu herself is described as ‚Äúthe true animal, the wild, beautiful animal‚Äù and the ‚Äúprimal form of woman‚Äù. When the action of the play starts, Lulu has been rescued by the rich newspaper publisher Dr Sch√∂n from a life on the streets with her alleged father, the petty criminal Schigolch. Dr Sch√∂n has taken Lulu under his wing, educated her and made her his lover. Wishing however to make a more socially advantageous match for himself, he has married her off to the medic Dr Goll. In the first Act Dr Goll has brought Lulu to have her portrait painted by Schwarz. Left alone with him, Lulu seduces the painter. When Dr Goll returns to confront them, he collapses with a fatal heart attack. In Act Two, Lulu has married the painter Schwarz, who, with Sch√∂n‚Äôs assistance, has now achieved fame and wealth. She remains Sch√∂n‚Äôs mistress, however. Wishing to be rid of her ahead of his forthcoming marriage to a society belle, Charlotte von Zarnikow, Sch√∂n informs Schwarz about her dissolute past. Schwarz is shocked to the core and ‚Äúguillotines‚Äù himself with his razor. In Act Three Lulu appears as a dancer in a revue, her new career promoted by Sch√∂n‚Äôs son Alwa, who is now also infatuated with her. Dr Sch√∂n is forced to admit that he is in her thrall. Lulu forces him to break off his engagement to Charlotte. In Act Four Lulu is now married to Dr Sch√∂n but is unfaithful to him with several other people (Schigolch, Alwa, the circus artist Rodrigo Quast and the lesbian Countess Geschwitz). On discovering this, Sch√∂n presses a revolver into her hand, urging her to kill herself. Instead, she uses it to shoot Sch√∂n, all the while declaring him the only man she has ever loved. She is imprisoned for her crime. Her escape from prison with the aid of Countess Geschwitz and subsequent career down to her death at the hands of Jack the Ripper in London are the subject of the sequel, Pandora‚Äôs Box. It is now customary in theatre performances to run the two plays together, in abridged form, under the title Lulu. Reception The play has attracted a wide range of interpretations, from those who see it as misogynistic to those who claim Wedekind as a harbinger of women's liberation.Lewis 1997, p. 29 Central to these divergent readings is the ambiguous figure of Lulu herself. Arguably, she embodies not so much the \\"primal form of woman\\" (a nebulous and subjective concept) as perceptions ‚Äì in particular, male perceptions ‚Äì of that \\"primal form\\". It is significant that we never learn Lulu's true name, only the names imposed on her by a succession of lovers.Finney 1989, p. 89 To Schigolch she is \\"Lulu\\", an asexual name suggestive of children's earliest speech. To Sch√∂n she is \\"Mignon\\", the name of the mysterious girl in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship who pursues the hero with submissive fidelity. To Schwarz she is Eve, mankind's first mother but also alleged agent (in the biblical narrative) of our undoing. Each man, secure in the patriarchal society to which she is a potential affront, finds in her what he wants to see; her own needs, meanwhile, remain obscured. A key stage prop throughout the play (and its sequel) is Schwarz's portrait of Lulu, which depicts her dressed as Pierrot. By further associating his heroine with this \\"na√Øve, comic, yet also pathetic\\" figure, Wedekind reminds audiences of her \\"essential vulnerability\\".Skrine 1989, p. 89 Adaptations The play was adapted for film twice, in 1923 by Leopold Jessner, starring Asta Nielsen,Erdgeist, \\"1923\\" and by Walerian Borowczyk for French television in 1980, starring Anne Bennant.Lulu, \\"1980\\" It is currently being adapted for comics by John Linton Roberson. Roberson, John Linton. \\"Lulu\\" The two Lulu plays were combined for the silent film Pandora's Box (1929) and for Alban Berg's opera Lulu (1937). An Italian version by director Mario Missiroli was made in 1980, starring Stefania Sandrelli. References Notes Bibliography * Banham, Martin, ed. 1998. The Cambridge Guide to Theatre.

She was responsible for delivering and disbursing goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Hesperia (AKS-13), built as the Liberty ship SS Sam Dale, was launched under Maritime Commission contract by Delta Shipbuilding Co., New Orleans, Louisiana, 18 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Marie Owen; converted to Navy use by Norfolk Naval Shipyard and commissioned 1 April 1945, Lt. Comdr. William G. Dutton in command.  World War II service  Following a period of training and shakedown, Hesperia loaded her cargo of general stores for the fleet and sailed 16 May 1945. Transiting the Panama Canal, she arrived Pearl Harbor 13 June 1945. The stores ship then proceeded to the western Pacific for the important job of supplying operating units with some of the thousands of items‚Äîfrom clothing to spare parts‚Äînecessary to a modern fighting ship. She arrived Ulithi 6 July and after issuing stores to the ships present sailed with a convoy for Okinawa, site of the Pacific's largest amphibious assault just 3 months earlier. Hesperia anchored in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, 21 July and began issuing supplies of all kinds to the fleet and shore installations. She continued to function as a mobile supply base, interrupted only by occasional enemy air attacks, until after hostilities ended in mid-August. Having issued her entire stock the ship departed Okinawa 26 August for Manus. She arrived 7 September, loaded another full stock of replacement items, and sailed 22 September.  Surviving a dangerous typhoon  Hesperia encountered the great typhoon which had devastated Okinawa during her voyage to Korea, but after altering course temporarily continued to Jinsen, arriving 17 October. During the next month she serviced nearly 100 ships and small craft engaged in the Korean and Chinese occupations, operating from Jinsen, and later Taku, China. After this vital support duty, allowing the ships to remain on station for longer periods of time, she returned to Guam for a fresh issue 29 November 1945. Loading completed, she sailed 20 December to Yokosuka, Japan, and after her arrival 6 days later issued stores to over 500 ships and small craft and the shore activities connected with the occupation of Japan.  Post-war activity  Her job in Japan temporarily completed, Hesperia got underway 2 March 1946 for the United States, and arrived San Francisco, California, 30 March. During the next months she made two more voyages to supply the fleet, one to Pearl Harbor, the other to Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein.  Decommissioning  Returning to San Francisco 23 December 1946, she decommissioned 27 February 1947, was delivered to the Maritime Commission, and joined the National Defense Reserve Fleet. She was berthed at present at Suisun Bay, California. Final Disposition: she was scrapped in 1973.

He was the son of Thomas Sewell of West Ham, Essex. He is said to have been \\"bred up under an attorney\\". Sewell was a member of Middle Temple, called to the bar in 1734, and practised in the Chancery courts, where he was high successful. He became a bencher of his inn and King's Counsel in 1754, and Treasurer of the Inn in 1765. By 1764, he was thought to be making between ¬£3000 and ¬£4000 a year from his practice, and was popular among religious dissenters as their champion in the courts. Political career  He stood for Parliament in 1754 at Wallingford and was defeated, despite spending more than ¬£2000 (from the Prime Minister's election fund) in the attempt, but was elected in 1758 as member for Harwich. Harwich was a \\"Treasury borough\\", where the government candidate was certain of success, but Sewell had his own interest in the town as well, since his father-in-law, Thomas Heath had been its MP earlier in the century. However, he made little impact in the Commons and at the next election was not re-nominated at Harwich. He stood instead at Exeter, where he was badly defeated despite Prime Minister Newcastle's support, though this time at his own expense rather than the government's. Nevertheless, later in the year he was returned instead as the government candidate at Winchelsea. In 1761, Sewell was one of two candidates considered for appointment as Solicitor General, but the post went instead to Fletcher Norton. However, in 1764 he was knighted and appointed Master of the Rolls, apparently to the surprise of many including himself, after a number of other candidates had refused the post; he held it until his death twenty years later. He earned a reputation as an able and efficient judge. He was also made a member of the Privy Council. Family  He married firstly Catherine Heath, daughter of Thomas Heath, MP for Harwich, by whom he had eight children, including Thomas Bailey Heath Sewell, his eldest son and heir, and Frances, who married Matthew Lewis, the Deputy Secretary at War, by whom she was the mother of the writer Matthew Lewis. She and her husband were later separated. He married secondly Mary Elizabeth Sibthorpe, daughter of Humphry Sibthorp, professor of botany at Oxford University and his first wife Sarah Waldo, by whom he had no surviving issue. Thomas Bailey Heath Sewell married Lady Elizabeth Bermingham, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Bermingham, 1st Earl of Louth. Their son, also Thomas, made out a claim to the older Bermingham title Baron Athenry, but failed to establish his right, the House of Lords ruling, as they also did in another case, that the title could not descend in the female line.

The project site is located from Indira Gandhi International Airport, the airport that currently serves the needs of the entire National Capital Region and is quickly reaching its peak capacity; 36 km from Bulandshahr, 60 km from Noida & 70 km from Faridabad & Ghaziabad, about 48 km from Greater Noida, 65 km from Aligarh, 65 km from Gurgaon and 130 km from Agra. It will be connected to the Yamuna Expressway, allowing domestic and international tourists to reach Agra, Mathura and Vrindavan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of Jewar Airport. YEIDA has identified 5,100 hectares for the project, out of which 240 hectares belongs to the state government and the rest is owned by private entities. YEIDA will acquire 1,327 hectares in the first phase for the construction of terminal buildings and runways. Bids for the airport are expected to be invited by the end of 2019. It will be the third commercial airport in Delhi NCR after Indira Gandhi International Airport and a regional airport at Hindon. It is proposed to be connected to Delhi Metro via the Noida Metro route and via the Delhi- Faridabad-Ballabhgarh‚ÄìPalwal-Jewar route. History The project was first proposed in 2001 by then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Rajnath Singh as a greenfield Taj International and aviation Hub (TIAH) at Jewar village near Greater Noida, adjacent to the Yamuna Expressway. The Central government cleared the techno-feasibility report for setting up TIAH in April 2003. It was to be built at an approximate cost of 5000 crore by the year 2007-08. The project was put on hold during the UPA regime because the project site was within 150 kilometres of an existing greenfield airport in Delhi. This site was within 72 kilometres of Indira Gandhi International Airport(IGI), Delhi. Its operator, GMR Group had protested against plans for another international airport within 150 kilometres of the existing Delhi airport, claiming that it would impact traffic and revenue generation. GMR has right of first refusal (RoFR) on a new airport within 150 kilometres of the existing Delhi airport. The RoFR was to ensure that GMR gets preference in bidding for the Greater Noida airport in case its bid price is within 10% of the lowest bidder. When the Akhilesh Yadav led government was formed in Uttar Pradesh in 2012, it contemplated shelving the project while proposing a new international airport in Agra. In June 2013, the State Government finalised on the Kurrikupa village near Hirangaon, Tundla in the Firozabad district as the site for the proposed airport. In January 2014, the Defence Ministry raised some objections regarding the site near Tundla. The state government allocated land near Etmadpur for the proposed airport in November 2014. In 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was voted to power at the Centre and the project was again shifted back to Jewar. The civil aviation ministry cleared the proposal for the new airport to be set up on 2,200 acres of land in June 2015 The Union Ministry of Defence (MoD) cleared the project in June 2016. The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) gave an in-principle approval to the Uttar Pradesh government to build the airport in May 2018. In July 2017, the Union Chief Secretary for Aviation warned the Uttar Pradesh government to expedite the planning process as Hisar Airport was also pushing for its competing Union Cabinet approval for building another airport to serve the NCR region, thus prolonging the return on investment for both airports due to a still-feasible- but-diluted viability for both.Aviation secy tells UP to form Jewar airport SPV, Yamuna Authority‚Äôs hands full, money Control News, 10 July 2017. India's largest airport With six runways once all its expansions are completed, it will be India's largest airport and among the world's largest airports. Only the O'Hare International Airport and the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport are larger, with eight and seven runways respectively. Other existing airports with six runways are Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Logan International Airport, Boston and Denver International Airport. As of September 2019, with three runways, the Indira Gandhi International Airport has the highest number of runways of any airport in India. Since 2019, there is a proposal of two additional runways to bring the total to eight runways once completed. This is being done keeping future expansion in mind and is subject to the availability of land. The proposal has been given the green signal by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

Photo: J. Fortier Raute are a nomadic indigenous ethnic group officially recognized by the Government of Nepal. They are known for subsistence hunting of langur and macaque monkeys. They gather wild forest tubers, fruits, and greens on a regular basis. To obtain grain (rice), iron, cloth, and jewelry, they carve wooden bowls and boxes to trade for goods from local farmers. They do not sell other forest products, bushmeat, or forest medicinal plants. Their population is estimated at about 650, with 618 in Nepal's 2011 census,https://unstats.un.org/unsD/demographic/sources/census/wphc/Nepal/Nepal- Census-2011-Vol1.pdf people living in small settlements in the regions of western Nepal. Most have been forcibly settled by the government of Nepal but there are about 150 nomadic Raute, who, as late as 2016, still chose to live a nomadic life. The government of Nepal has permitted them to cut down small trees in state - run forests needed for poles in erecting their tents, which often puts them in friction with the local population.BBC Documentary on Nomadic LifeKate Humble, , BBC Documentary / Nov 2016, minutes 14:02‚Äì17:13. The Raute move from place to place, spending no more than 4 to 5 months at one place at a time, and often no more than a few days, in search of better water sources, or of villages where they can sell their wood products for food staples. The Raute language is called \\"Raute\\" in most studies and sometimes \\"Khamci,\\" meaning \\"our talk\\" in a few other studies. It is closely related to the language spoken by two related ethnic groups, the Ban Raji (\\"Little Rulers of the Forest\\") and Raji (\\"Little Rulers\\") of the same region (Fortier and Rastogi 2004). Rautes emphasize that they wish to remain full-time foragers and not assimilate into the surrounding farming population. Founding principles The Raute people emphasize that their continued existence is based on three principles: * Remaining nomadic * Continuing their own native culture, language, and education * Remaining hunter-gatherers References  Sources  * Bista, Dor Bahadur 1978 Encounter with the Raute: Last Hunting Nomads of Nepal.

The current version of the deed of gift is the third revision of the original deed. from Wikisource The original deed was written in 1852 and forwarded to the New York Yacht Club on July 8, 1857.The Deed of Gift of the America's Cup and related manuscripts from the archives of the New York Yacht Club Revised Edition (2007) by Ryoichi Steven Tsuchiya Brief history The surviving members of the syndicate which owned the yacht America, the first winner of what would become the America's Cup (n√©e ‚ÄúRoyal Yacht Squadron Cup‚Äù or the ‚ÄúRYS Cup for One Hundred Sovereigns‚Äù), donated the America's Cup through a deed of gift to the New York Yacht Club on July 8, 1857. The cup would be held in trust as a ‚Äúchallenge trophy\\" to promote friendly competition among nations, with the deed of gift being the primary instrument governing the rules to make a valid challenge for the America‚Äôs Cup and the rules of conduct of the races. After the 1881 Cup match, the New York Yacht Club officially returned the Cup to George L. Schuyler, the sole surviving member of the syndicate that owned America to rewrite the deed to discourage Canadian yacht clubs based on the Great Lakes from challenging the Cup. This revised Deed incorporated, among other things, the following rules: the challenger‚Äôs yacht club's annual regatta must take place on the sea or on an arm of the sea, and the challenging boat must sail to the site of the contest on her own bottom, as the yacht America did when first winning the cup in England.The Lawson History of the America's Cup (1902) by Winfield M. Thompson and Thomas W. Lawson In 1887, the challenging yacht‚Äôs hull was much longer than originally stated by the challenger, a potential advantage. The difference alarmed the N.Y.Y.C., but they rectified the situation by handicapping the challenger. Although the N.Y.Y.C. successfully defended the Cup that year, the problem spurred them to rewrite the Deed. Once again the club officially returned the Cup to Schuyler. The third Deed is much longer and couched in legal terminology. The third Deed tightened the rules for challenging; for example, it stated explicitly that the challenger must not exceed the dimensions provided to the holder of the Cup. The new version of the rules created an uproar among many British yachtsmen, who claimed that the new rules made it impossible to challenge. No one challenged until six years later, when British railroad tycoon James Lloyd Ashbury set forth his first of two challenges. After the Second World War, the N.Y.Y.C. amended the Deed by changing the requirement regarding waterline length: the minimum waterline length was reduced from to to allow the use of the 12-metre class. In addition, the rule that the challenging boat had to sail on her own bottom to the site of the match was eliminated, permitting boats to be shipped to the venue without requiring them to be able to sail across oceans (or contain living accommodations). In 1985 a second amendment was made to allow for matches to take place during the summer in the Southern Hemisphere.BYM News More about the Deed of Gift & subsequent changes. Interpretation The Deed of Gift is a registered Trust document in the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan (New York County), New York City, New York, which is a court of first instance, unlike supreme courts of other jurisdictions. An interpretation of the document, when contested, can be taken before that Court for clarification on whether the Deed of Gift's terms and conditions (as written by George L. Schuyler) are being met. The wording of the deed is comparatively straightforward but written in the legal language, style and terminology of the time it was written. In later years this has given rise to disputes relating to the meaning of particular phrases and words and clarified or further confused by taking a view on what the donor actually intended when the deed was written. There have been two instances of litigation regarding interpretation appealed to the New York Court of Appeals, that state's highest court. The first concerned the challenge for the 1988 America's Cup, where the question was first, whether the Mercury Bay Boating Club was a valid challenger and if the San Diego Yacht Club had to accept their challenge; and second, whether the Defender's boat (a catamaran) complied with the terms of the Deed of Gift. The answer was yes to both questions. The second concerned Soci√©t√© Nautique de Gen√®ve, the defender of the 2010 America's Cup, where the question was whether a valid challenge could be accepted by the defender from a 'shell' yacht club that was formed for the specific purpose of challenging and had not previously held a properly constituted annual regatta on an ocean water course or an arm of the sea. The court's answer was no. There were subsequently a number of additional issues raised regarding the type of boat to be used, the venue and other points which were put to the court by the court adjudicated valid challenger Golden Gate Yacht Club. All were upheld by the court with the exception of two issues which were open and still awaiting court decisions even after the completion of the 2010 America's Cup races but both sides agreed to drop all outstanding legal actions soon after.

Pyotr Zakharovich Ermakov () ( ‚Äì 22 May 1952) was a Russian Bolshevik revolutionary, notable as one of several men responsible for the execution of the Romanov family, including the deposed Tsar Nicholas II, his wife, their children, and their retinue. Biography Pyotr Zakharovich Ermakov was born on , and raised in and around the Verkh-Isetskiy workhouse in Yekaterinburg, Russian Empire. Ermakov graduated from the local parish school, working thereafter as a metal craftsman, and between 1909 and 1912, is listed as living in Vologodskaya Province. By the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Ermakov had returned to Yekaterinburg, and by the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917 following the Russian Revolution, had aligned himself with the communist Bolshevik faction. He became a member of the combat guard of the Verkh- Isetskiy plant, participating in the protection of clandestine meetings, the expropriation of private property, and the murder of loyalist provocateurs. Execution of the Imperial Family By early 1918, the former Russian Imperial Family was in Bolshevik custody, and had originally been transported to the city of Tobolsk following Tsar Nicholas II's abdication. The imperial family was moved again to Yekaterinburg as a result of White Army forces approaching the outskirts of Tobolsk. By mid-1918, with White Army forces now edging closer to the outskirts of Yekaterinburg, the local Bolshevik authorities were instructed by Yakov Sverdlov, with the assent of Vladimir Lenin by means of a telegram, to execute the imperial family. Feeling that the guards guarding the family had possibly become too sympathetic, it was decided to replace them with zealous Bolsheviks, among them was Pyotr Ermakov, in order that the execution would be completed without failure. According to historians Greg King and Penny Wilson, Ermakov played a leading role in the executions, and is considered to have been the right-hand man of chief executioner Yakov Yurovsky. On the night of the executions, Ermakov was very intoxicated, and according to the account by King and Wilson, was the most bloodthirsty of the executioners. According to various reports, Ermakov was among the many men in the firing squad who shot the already-dead former Tsar. His next target was Empress Alexandra, who was unable to finish the sign of the cross before she was shot dead. After momentarily stopping the firing due to the large amounts of rifle smoke, the executioners were ordered to also execute the Tsar's daughters Grand Duchess Olga, Maria and Anastasia, and their remaining servant Anna Demidova. Ermakov is reported to have delivered the killing blow to Olga, and severely wounded Maria and Anastasia. According to an account by Peter Voikov, who was the commissar of supplies for the Ural Soviet, during the execution Ermakov yelled out that the maid, Demidova, and the youngest daughter, Anastasia, were still alive. One of the Cheka Latvians drove a bayonet through Anastasia's face.Victor Alexandrov, \\"The End of the Romanovs\\", p. 232 Yurovsky described how Ermakov tried to kill the Grand Duchesses with his bayonet, and that Ermakov's men tried to plunder the jewels found in the clothing.Steinberg and Krustalev, \\"Fall of the Romanovs\\", p.361 Prior to the killings, Ermakov had promised his Upper Isetsk companions that they would get to rape the women and kill the males, instructing them to wait in the forest with light carts for transporting the bodies.Radzinsky, p. 402 However, when Yurovsky's special detachment arrived, Ermakov's men were outraged to discover that they were already dead.Slater, p. 9 Yurovsky maintained control of the situation with great difficulty, eventually getting Ermakov's men to shift some of the bodies from the truck onto the carts.Rappaport, p. 197 While Yurovsky and his men were busy extricating the truck from the mud, Ermakov's men pawed the female bodies for valuables hidden in their undergarments, two of whom lifted up Alexandra's skirt and fingered her genitals. Yurovsky ordered them at gunpoint to back off, dismissing the two who had groped the tsarina's corpse and any others he had caught looting. Nonetheless, one of the men sniggered that he could \\"die in peace\\", having touched the \\"royal cunt\\". With the exception of Ermakov, his men were not allowed to participate in the process of stripping, mutilating and disposing of the bodies; they were ordered back to the city as Yurovsky did not trust them and was displeased with their drunkenness.Rappaport, p. 198 He was also furious at Ermakov for bringing only one shovel for the disposal.Rappaport, p. 196 Later life Ermakov later participated directly in the Russian Civil War, and after the war found work in law enforcement in Omsk, Yekaterinburg, and Chelyabinsk. By 1927, Ermakov was employed as inspector for the prisons of the Urals region, and by 1934 was drawing his pension. Unlike the other killers, Ermakov received no awards or advancements for his part in the murders, for which he grew bitter. For the rest of his life,Radzinsky, p. 397 he fought relentlessly for primacy by inflating his role in the murders as well as the revolution.Rappaport, p. 215 In 1935, Ermakov gave an interview to American journalist Richard Halliburton, describing the burning and destruction of the bodies of the Imperial family and their servants.The Scientific Expedition to Account for the Romanov Children It was later discovered that his \\"deathbed confession\\" had been staged by the NKVD; the story was deliberately fabricated and then spoon-fed to the naive Halliburton in order to conceal the actual events. Death Ermakov died in Sverdlovsk on 22 May 1952 from cancer at the age of 67 and was buried at Ivanovskoye Kladbishche. After his death, the local Communist Party renamed one of the streets in Sverdlovsk to Ermakova. After 1991, the street was renamed back to its historical name of Klyuchevskaya. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, local Communist Party members annually pay tribute to his gravestone on each anniversary of the murders, though on a few occasions it was also vandalized and dowsed in red paint, symbolizing the blood of the royal martyrs.

The zoo houses 1,800 animals and covers an area of . It is noted for the second birth of polar bears and siamangs in captivity and for their locally famous gorilla Samson, who lived from 1950 to 1981 and whose bones are now on display at the Milwaukee Public Museum. During World War II, a celebrity animal of the zoo was Gertie the Duck and her ducklings. The zoo is also home to one of the largest group of bonobos in one location outside their native Democratic Republic of the Congo, and has two cheetahs from the National Zoo in Washington, DC. History =The Washington Park Zoo= The West Park Zoo opened in 1892, displaying small mammals and birds. The following year, the zoo added two cinnamon bears and created an iron bear den. In 1899, the zoo constructed a $2,137 herbivore building that housed a variety of animals. In 1900, West Park Zoo became Washington Park Zoo and two years later, the zoo was expanded to . Even with the Great Depression of the 1930s, the zoo prospered, creating a bear den that resembled bears' natural habitat. In 1931, the zoo's bear collection contained 37 specimens. By 1937, the Washington Park Zoo was beginning to show its age. A reptile exhibit was opened in the main zoo building in 1942. George Speidel, zoo director at this time, began planning a new zoo. =The Milwaukee County Zoo= Although still located in Washington Park, the zoo changed its name to the Milwaukee County Zoological Gardens in 1953. Fundraising took place in 1956 to offset the estimated cost for building the new zoo of US $12.6 million. The Milwaukee County Zoo opened in 1958 with the primate building, monkey island, feline house, pachyderm mall, and grizzly bear den. The zoo also opened with a gauge miniature railway, the Zoo Line, which carried visitors around the zoo to view the exhibits and construction. The Zoo Line (now known as the Safari Train) has continued to run, operating with real steam locomotives. In 1959, construction started on the dall sheep mountain and the Alaskan bear exhibit. On May 13, 1961, the Milwaukee County Zoo officially opened to the public. Later additions included the aviary (1962), the Australian building (1963), the original animal hospital (1963), the small mammal building (1965), the aquarium (1968), and the reptile building (1968). In 1965, four Zoomobile tour trains were donated by Allis-Chalmers. This was followed by the children's zoo (1971), and the polar bear underwater viewing exhibit (1986). In 1986, the children's zoo was renamed the Stackner Heritage Farm, and a dairy complex was constructed as part of it, to celebrate Wisconsin as America's Dairyland. The complex included a cow barn, education center, and dairy store. In 1988, the Taylor Family Humboldt penguin exhibit, the education center, and the Peck Welcome Center opened. In the following years, the renovated sea lion exhibit, featuring underwater viewing, opened, and the aviary was renovated. More recent changes include the addition of the Sterns Family Apes of Africa exhibit (1992), the renovation of the aquarium and reptile building (now known as the Aquatic and Reptile Center), the renovation of the small mammal building (1998), and the addition of the Wong Family Pheasantry (1998). In 2002, Monkey Island was renovated to include a large deck for viewing, and was renamed Macaque Island. 2003 saw a newly remodeled animal health center; 2004, a new education center; and 2005 and 2006, the remodeling of the Heritage Farm, feline building, and giraffe exhibit. The zoo's newest construction plan was a new West Entrance with a gift shop and a new North American river otter exhibit, due to the small size of the existing tank in the Small Mammal House building, in addition a new parking lot, in order to facilitate reconstruction and reconfiguration due to the rebuilding of the Zoo Interchange to the southeast of the zoo property by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. Exhibits A foraging gorilla in the Sterns Building at the Milwaukee County Zoo. =Taylor Family Humboldt Penguin Pool= This is an exhibit near the zoo's Main Entrance. This fifteen- thousand gallon tank features a group of Humboldt penguins with underwater viewing glass surrounding it. =Herb and Nada Mahler Family Aviary= The aviary contains over 60 species in a walk-through building. One section is a cageless room where birds fly free. Species in the exhibit include the Caribbean flamingo, scarlet ibis, rhinoceros hornbill, Bali mynah, King vulture, Rockhopper penguin, Gentoo penguin, Red-billed hornbill, the Whooping crane, Inca tern and Sunbittern, as well as various pigeons and herons. =Sterns Family Apes of Africa= This indoor building features a large troop of bonobos and gorillas. For many years, Samson, the largest gorilla in captivity, was showcased in the Apes of Africa building. The zoo maintains a bonobo breeding program with one of the largest collections of bonobos in captivity in the world. Both species have access to indoor and outdoor exhibits. As of 2018, the zoo will have a total of four Western lowlands gorillas, after the death of 31-year-old dominant male Cassius and 17-year-old Naku in April. =Primates of the World= Adjacent to Apes of Africa, this exhibit showcases primates from the around the world, including Mandrills, Sumatran orangutans, Siamangs, Black-and-white colobus, and Black-handed Spider monkeys in a gallery-style exhibit. The zoo featured one of the first births of a Siamang in captivity. =Macaque Island= Macaque Island features a troop of Japanese macaques. It is a large mountain surrounded by water. It was remodeled in 2002 to include a large viewing deck for zoo guests and an expanded shelter for the resident macaques, with waterfalls and a larger mountain. =Aquatic and Reptile Center= This building holds invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and amphibians including the zoo's Chinese alligator, Green anaconda, Mexican beaded lizard and King cobra as well as various Cichlids and Rockfish and a Giant Pacific octopus. =Small Mammal Building= This building, located near the Aquatic and Reptile Center, features a special room for nocturnal species that is darkened in the day and brightened at night so the animals live on a schedule friendly to zoo visitors. Residents include the Fennec fox, sugar glider, vampire bat, ring-tailed lemur, Springhaas, dwarf mongoose, Straw-coloured fruit bat, Potto, Mohol Bushbaby, Southern Three- banded Armadillo, various small monkeys and tamarins and a larger exhibit for Two-toed sloth and red-rumped agouti. Other species are sometimes rotated in and out, such as the zoo's red pandas during construction of the Florence Mila Borchert Big Cat Country building in 2004. =North America= A series of outdoor exhibits themed around the megafauna of the North American continent, primarily bears and deer, featuring the grizzly bear, Alaskan brown bear, polar bear, American elk, trumpeter swan, harbor seal, prairie dog, American badger, reindeer, and sandhill crane. Many of these species are displayed in predator-prey \\"panorama\\" exhibits, which make them appear to share the space via a hidden moat. There are future plans to renovate this area into an Alaskan themed exhibit in the near future. =Northwestern Mutual Family Farm= The newly renovated children's zoo with a focus on native midwestern United States wildlife and educational presentations, featuring species such as the hedgehog, the domestic duck, the North American porcupine, the Florida box turtle, the red-tailed hawk and the bald eagle. It replaced the zoo's Stackner Heritage Farm in 2005. Northwestern Mutual Family Farm also features a variety of farm animals such as Ayrshire cattle, Guinea Hog, Sicilian Donkey, Black-and-white Holstein Cow, chickens, goats, rabbits, Belted Galloway, Milking Shorthorn, Horses, & Scottish Highland Cow. =Africa/Asia/South America Mixed Exhibits= Jaguar A series out of outdoor exhibits featuring animals from three continents, sometimes in \\"panorama\\"-style displays in which predator and prey appear in the same exhibit due to hidden moats. Much of the space is currently being transformed into a multi phase project known as Adventure Africa, so the majority of the exhibits are dedicated to animals from the African savannah, including the plains zebra, waterbuck, greater kudu and common eland exhibits. South American species include greater rhea, Baird's tapir and alpaca, and an outdoor yard for the jaguar. Asian species include the Amur tiger and Bactrian camel. The Giraffe House, part of the same exhibit area, was renovated in 2006, allowing visitors to climb a deck and come face-to-face with the zoo's reticulated giraffe collection and even feed them. The giraffe exhibit is also an exhibit that remains the same at the Adventure Africa exhibit. Holz Family Impala Country was later introduced, bringing impala and Thomson's gazelle to the zoo's extensive collection of African animals. =Adventure Africa= Adventure Africa opened in spring of 2019. It is the new home for more than 7 animal species, four of which were transferred from their old exhibits. The new Elephant Care Center acts as an indoor shelter, recreation and training facility for African bush elephants, as well as a space for zoo classes and events. The elephants also have access to a 1.6 acre outdoor habitat with various enrichment opportunities, including a large watering hole and enrichment feeding walls. There are also heaters throughout the yard that allow the elephants to utilize the space during colder weather. Impala plains is one of two mixed exhibits in Adventure Africa; it contains impalas, plains zebras, ostriches, and grey crowned cranes. Another exhibit, the African forest, is home to eastern bongos, guinea fowl, and yellow-backed duikers. Future expansions to Adventure Africa include a new exhibit for hippopotamus and a conversion of the old elephant exhibit into a new space for the zoo's black rhinoceroses. =Florence Mila Borchert Big Cat Country= The zoo's sixteen-thousand square-foot indoor Big Cat exhibit was renovated significantly in 2005, cutting down on many smaller or indoor-only exhibits such as the cougar to focus on significantly expanding the indoor and outdoor homes for the zoo's core cat collection, including the African lion, Amur tiger, snow leopard, and jaguar, as well as the addition of a new, permanent home for the zoo's red pandas and a new exhibit for the cheetahs, the servals and the caracals. Additional cat species are sometimes housed there. =Otter Passage= Opened in Spring 2018, the otter passage is home to a group of in a large exhibit with two pools for underwater viewing. It opened alongside the new West Entrance and acts similar to the Taylor Family Humboldt Penguin Pool in that is an introduction exhibit depending on which entrance visitors choose to go through. =Otto Borchert Family Special Exhibits Gallery= This building is dedicated to special or traveling exhibits. Other Facilities =Safari Train= The Safari Train in 2009 The gauge rideable miniature railway, first opened in 1958, continues to transport guests around the zoo from Memorial Day through Labor Day. The railroad began operations using live steam locomotive #82, a locomotive built in 1957 by the Sandley Light Railway Works of Wisconsin Dells, on commission of the Milwaukee Journal for the zoo. The #82 was later joined by #1958, a diesel locomotive built in 1959, followed by two additional steam locomotives: #1916, a locomotive built in 1961, and #1924, a 4-6-2 locomotive built for the zoo in 1977. The #82 was eventually withdrawn, due to being too small to pull the longer trains the zoo needed to handle the crowds, and was placed on display. In 1989, the zoo loaned #82 to the recently rebuilt Riverside and Great Northern Railway, and later traded the engine to the R&GN; for a second diesel, #1992.http://dellstrain.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/05/sandleylegacy.pdf =Child friendly areas= *Playground *Treehouse area *Dinosaur exhibit (seasonal) *Sky Trail¬Æ Ropes Courses & Zip Line *Ski Safari *Zoo Mobile References External links  The Zoological Society of Milwaukee County Zoos in Wisconsin 15 in gauge railways in the United States Protected areas of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin Tourist attractions in Milwaukee ","title":"Milwaukee County Zoo"},{"id":"12890965","text":"Joosia obtusa is a species of plant in the family Rubiaceae.

It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It is threatened by habitat loss. Common names include Colombian walnut,Juglans neotropica. COLUMBIAN WALNUT Ecuadorian walnut, Andean walnut, nogal, cedro negro, cedro nogal, and nogal Bogotano.  Growth and cultivation Juglans neotropica tree. It is a slow-growing tree attaining heights of up to 40 meters, with grooved, red-brown bark and an oval-shaped canopy. The compound leaves, typical to all members of Juglans, are about 40 cm long, grouped at the ends of the branches, and have a serrated border. The species prefers loose-textured, fertile soils, and seems to thrive in somewhat muddy conditions. Neutral to slightly acidic soils are ideal; the tree will not tolerate calcaerous soils nor very acidic conditions. Andean Walnuts are found between 1600 and 2500 meters of elevation, in biomes where the average temperature is between 16 and 22 ¬∞C, and annual precipitation of between 1 and 3 meters that is distributed evenly throughout the year. The species does particularly well when planted near running water. It is found naturally in a wide variety of Pre-Montane and Montane forests, and most abundantly in cloud forests. Propagation is by seed; nuts are scarified with sandpaper, then planted in moist sand for 4 months at a temperature of 2 to 4 ¬∞C. Natural germination times are poorly studied, but new trees appear to grow where the nuts fall and are buried under leaf litter. The Andean walnut is allelopathic, like most walnuts, and its presence will kill some understory plants. It is a common host for Anthuriums and Philodendrons, which appear to be unaffected.  Fruit  Edible fruit is produced in husks that are yellow- green when ripe; collection is either by picking fallen fruits from the ground, or otherwise harvesting from the canopy when the husks show signs of being ripe. The sap of the fruit husk is a strong dye and can stain hands and clothing. The nut inside is within a much harder and more difficult to crack shell than Persian walnuts, but the meat inside is comparable in flavour, perhaps a bit sweeter. \\"Tocte\\", the fruit of the Andean walnut, are often sold in the farmer's markets of Ecuador. The process of husk removal often stains the shells of the nuts black. Like all walnuts, unripe fruit husks produce a strong yellow dye that does not require mordant; ripe fruits produce a strong red to brown dye that does not require a mordant, and if cooked in an iron pot, a strong deep black dye.Juglans nigra - Plants For A Future database report Fruits must be soaked in water for 24‚Äì48 hours, but not allowed to ferment, after which the loosened pulp can be manually removed to reveal the walnut inside. There may be as few as 20 or as many as 200 nuts in a kilogram. Optimum storage temperature is 4 to 6 ¬∞C.  Wood  The hard, durable wood of Andean walnut is highly prized in cabinetry, flooring, veneers, utensils, and other forms of decoration. In South America, it is referred to as nogal, and is among the most expensive woods available.

A network centred on Tripoli was opened from 17 March 1912 as part of the Italian occupation campaign. This extended from Tripoli 120 km west to Zuwara, 100 km south to Gharyan, and 10 km east to Tajura. A (later 950 mm) gauge railway was built east from Benghazi. The main route to Marj, 110 km long, was opened in stages between 1911 and 1927. Benghazi also had a 56 km branch to Suluq, opened in 1926. In summer 1941, the Italians started to build a Tripoli-Benghazi railway, but their defeat in World War II meant that work only progressed a few kilometres.Italian colonial railways in Libya (in Italian) Military extensions of some 40 km were made from Marj towards Derna in World War II. This was the final line to close, at the end of 1965. =Standard gauge= During World War II, the standard gauge Western Desert Extension railway was built from a junction 10 km east of Mersa Matruh in Egypt, to assist in the Allied defence of the area, and later the Allied advance across North Africa. The coastal railway had reached Sidi Barrani by October 1941 and Tobruk by December 1942, west of El Alamein. The 125 km Libyan section, west of Sallum, on the Egyptian border, was removed following its closure on 20 December 1946, but the Egyptian Railways Sollum line still sees occasional freight. Plans Beginning in 1998,\\"Libya: Railways\\" Europa World Year Book 2004 Europa Publications, London, volume 2, page 2667, the Libyan government has been planning for a 3170 km (standard gauge) network. A line parallel to the coast will eventually form part of a North African link between Tunisia and Egypt. The section from the border with Tunisia at Ras Ajdir, then via Tripoli to Sirte was under construction and was planned to open in 2009. China Railway Construction Corporation has contracts to start work in June 2008 on a 352 km route between Sirte and Khoms, to be finished by 2013. The east‚Äìwest line will be double track. A second line will run 800 km from iron ore deposits at Wadi Shati near Sabha to the steel works and port at Misrata from 2012. A third line will run 554 km from Sirte to Benghazi in the East. In October 2007, RZD submitted a feasibility study for the project, and in 2008 signed a contract to begin construction, which was planned to take 4 years to complete. Work began on 30 August 2008. In August 2010, RZD awarded Ansaldo STS and SELEX Communications a contract to install signalling, telecoms, power, security and ticketing systems which is expected to take three years.

While umpiring in the PCL he began using the line, \\"time to call 'em as I see 'em.\\" When Stratton completed his time with the Army, he returned to film, appearing in such features as Stalag 17 (1953) (as the narrator Cookie), a role in The Wild One (1953), and Bundle of Joy (1956). He starred in a total of 40 films during his film career, sharing the big screen with other notable actors such as Cary Grant, Shirley Temple, Marilyn Monroe, and William Holden.  Radio/television actor  In addition to acting in several films, Stratton began working as a radio actor in the late 1940s, performing in such shows as Lux Radio Theater, The Great Gildersleeve, and My Little Margie He worked opposite Judy Garland in the 1950 radio adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, and acted opposite Shirley Temple in a radio version of The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer. In the 1954-1955 television season, Stratton starred on CBS as \\"Junior\\" Jackson in the situation comedy That's My Boy as a son pushed by his father to become a football star at their common alma mater. His co-stars were Eddie Mayehoff as his father, a construction contractors in the series, and Rochelle Hudson as his mother, Alice Jackson. Oddly, Hudson, cast as the mother, was only six years older than Stratton. In the 1950s, Stratton appeared in several episodes of Jack Webb's Dragnet. In the 1970s and 1980s he made occasional guest appearances on many television series, usually portraying a sports announcer.  Sportscasting career  Stratton was hired by Los Angeles television station KNXT-TV (now CBS-2) in 1954 as a sportscaster and sports news anchor. He spent sixteen years as sports anchor of the show The Big News during the 1960s and 1970s. This was the first hour-long news program for the region. While there, he became recognized for his signature phrase \\"Time to call 'em as I see 'em\\", which he had started saying during his years as a baseball umpire. Within a year,\\"The Big News\\" was earning a 28 percent share in the Los Angeles ratings and the show format became the standard that was copied by other local TV stations across the country. Stratton was the last-surviving member of The Big News team prior to his death. He also served as a sportscaster for California CBS AM radio station, KNX 1070, from 1967 to 1984 and from 1986 to 1997 and for KTTV for a time in the 70's and 80's. While working for CBS Sports in both television and radio, he covered the 1960 Summer Olympics from Rome. He also covered the NFL as \\"the voice\\" of the Los Angeles Rams in the 1960s, and called Major League Baseball games, Kentucky Derbies, and feature races from Santa Anita, Hollywood Park, and Del Mar. He also covered many other sports, such as hockey, tennis, track and field and golf. MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann worked with Stratton at both KCBS/KNXT and at KNX 1070. He said of Stratton, \\"There aren't many renaissance men in any age, but Gil was one of them.\\" Stratton won five local Emmys during his television career, and was also awarded seven Golden Mike awards from the Radio-Television News Association.  Retirement and later life  Stratton first retired from TV and radio in 1984, and traveled to the Big Island of Hawaii, where he became Owner/General Manager of a small radio station, 790 AM KKON, in Kealakekua, Hawaii. But being behind the desk was not for Stratton - he wanted to be behind the microphone again. Stratton sold the station to Bill Evans and returned again to KNX 1070 radio in 1986 as a weekend sports anchor. He retired again in 1997, but continued doing charity work, such as hosting many charity golf tournaments to raise funds for Henry Mayo Hospital in Newhall. The hospital later named a newborn nursery after him in appreciation of his work. He also taught classes in broadcasting at California State University Northridge. Stratton died on October 11, 2008, at the age of 86.

He was a student of Rabbenu Tam.Yom Tob of Joigny at the Jewish Encyclopedia Clifford's Tower, where the Rabbi Yom Tob and the Jews of York were killed in 1190. Pogrom He died at York Castle on 17 March 1190. The incident was provoked by Richard de Malbis (Richard Malebisse), who was in considerable debt to Aaron of Lincoln. When a fire accidentally broke out in the city on 16 March 1190, de Malbis used the opportunity to incite a mob to attack the home of Benedict of York, the recently deceased agent of Aaron of Lincoln, killing his widow and children and burning the house. The following evening, (the day of the Jewish feast of Shabbat HaGadol, the shabbat before Passover), Josce of York (Joseph), the leader of the Jewish community of York, gained permission from the constable of York Castle to bring his wife and children, Rabbi Yom Tov and the rest of the Jews into the castle. The group, numbering about 150, then took refuge in the castle's motte that had a wooden tower. But the motte was besieged by the mob demanding that the Jews be baptized and convert to Christianity. With no hope of escape, Rabbi Yom Tov advised the other Jews to kill themselves rather than convert. Josce began by slaying his wife Anna and two children. He was then killed by Yom Tov. The father of each family killed his wife and children and then Yom Tov stabbed the men before killing himself. The tower was set alight so their bodies could not be mutilated by the mob. A handful of Jews who did not kill themselves surrendered at daybreak on 17 March, leaving the castle on a promise that they would not be harmed. But they were all killed by the mob. The pogrom was part of a series of massacres against other Jewish communities in England over the preceding weeks. It was in the wake of religious fervor created from preparations for the Third Crusade led by Richard I against the Saracens.

In order to solve this problem it is necessary to know the parameters of the camera projection function from 3D to 2D for the cameras involved, in the simplest case represented by the camera matrices. Triangulation is sometimes also referred to as reconstruction. The triangulation problem is in theory trivial. Since each point in an image corresponds to a line in 3D space, all points on the line in 3D are projected to the point in the image. If a pair of corresponding points in two, or more images, can be found it must be the case that they are the projection of a common 3D point x. The set of lines generated by the image points must intersect at x (3D point) and the algebraic formulation of the coordinates of x (3D point) can be computed in a variety of ways, as is presented below. In practice, however, the coordinates of image points cannot be measured with arbitrary accuracy. Instead, various types of noise, such as geometric noise from lens distortion or interest point detection error, lead to inaccuracies in the measured image coordinates. As a consequence, the lines generated by the corresponding image points do not always intersect in 3D space. The problem, then, is to find a 3D point which optimally fits the measured image points. In the literature there are multiple proposals for how to define optimality and how to find the optimal 3D point. Since they are based on different optimality criteria, the various methods produce different estimates of the 3D point x when noise is involved.  Introduction  In the following, it is assumed that triangulation is made on corresponding image points from two views generated by pinhole cameras. Generalization from these assumptions are discussed here. The ideal case of epipolar geometry. A 3D point x is projected onto two camera images through lines (green) which intersect with each camera's focal point, O1 and O2. The resulting image points are y1 and y2. The green lines intersect at x. In practice, the image points y1 and y2 cannot be measured with arbitrary accuracy. Instead points y'1 and y'2 are detected and used for the triangulation. The corresponding projection lines (blue) do not, in general, intersect in 3D space and may also not intersect with point x. The image to the left illustrates the epipolar geometry of a pair of stereo cameras of pinhole model. A point x (3D point) in 3D space is projected onto the respective image plane along a line (green) which goes through the camera's focal point, mathbf{O}_{1} and mathbf{O}_{2} , resulting in the two corresponding image points mathbf{y}_{1} and mathbf{y}_{2} . If mathbf{y}_{1} and mathbf{y}_{2} are given and the geometry of the two cameras are known, the two projection lines (green lines) can be determined and it must be the case that they intersect at point x (3D point). Using basic linear algebra that intersection point can be determined in a straightforward way. The image to the right shows the real case. The position of the image points mathbf{y}_{1} and mathbf{y}_{2} cannot be measured exactly. The reason is a combination of factors such as * Geometric distortion, for example lens distortion, which means that the 3D to 2D mapping of the camera deviates from the pinhole camera model. To some extent these errors can be compensated for, leaving a residual geometric error. * A single ray of light from x (3D point) is dispersed in the lens system of the cameras according to a point spread function. The recovery of the corresponding image point from measurements of the dispersed intensity function in the images gives errors. * In a digital camera, the image intensity function is only measured in discrete sensor elements. Inexact interpolation of the discrete intensity function have to be used to recover the true one. * The image points y1' and y2' used for triangulation are often found using various types of feature extractors, for example of corners or interest points in general. There is an inherent localization error for any type of feature extraction based on neighborhood operations. As a consequence, the measured image points are mathbf{y}'_{1} and mathbf{y}'_{2} instead of mathbf{y}_{1} and mathbf{y}_{2} . However, their projection lines (blue) do not have to intersect in 3D space or come close to x. In fact, these lines intersect if and only if mathbf{y}'_{1} and mathbf{y}'_{2} satisfy the epipolar constraint defined by the fundamental matrix. Given the measurement noise in mathbf{y}'_{1} and mathbf{y}'_{2} it is rather likely that the epipolar constraint is not satisfied and the projection lines do not intersect. This observation leads to the problem which is solved in triangulation. Which 3D point xest is the best estimate of x given mathbf{y}'_{1} and mathbf{y}'_{2} and the geometry of the cameras? The answer is often found by defining an error measure which depends on xest and then minimizing this error. In the following sections, some of the various methods for computing xest presented in the literature are briefly described. All triangulation methods produce xest = x in the case that mathbf{y}_{1} = mathbf{y}'_{1} and mathbf{y}_{2} = mathbf{y}'_{2} , that is, when the epipolar constraint is satisfied (except for singular points, see below). It is what happens when the constraint is not satisfied which differs between the methods.  Properties of triangulation methods  A triangulation method can be described in terms of a function tau , such that : mathbf{x} sim tau(mathbf{y}'_{1}, mathbf{y}'_{2}, mathbf{C}_{1}, mathbf{C}_{2}) where mathbf{y}'_{1}, mathbf{y}'_{2} are the homogeneous coordinates of the detected image points and mathbf{C}_{1}, mathbf{C}_{2} are the camera matrices. x (3D point) is the homogeneous representation of the resulting 3D point. The sim , sign implies that tau , is only required to produce a vector which is equal to x up to a multiplication by a non-zero scalar since homogeneous vectors are involved. Before looking at the specific methods, that is, specific functions tau , , there are some general concepts related to the methods that need to be explained. Which triangulation method is chosen for a particular problem depends to some extent on these characteristics. = Singularities = Some of the methods fail to correctly compute an estimate of x (3D point) if it lies in a certain subset of the 3D space, corresponding to some combination of mathbf{y}'_{1}, mathbf{y}'_{2}, mathbf{C}_{1}, mathbf{C}_{2} . A point in this subset is then a singularity of the triangulation method. The reason for the failure can be that some equation system to be solved is under-determined or that the projective representation of xest becomes the zero vector for the singular points. = Invariance = In some applications, it is desirable that the triangulation is independent of the coordinate system used to represent 3D points; if the triangulation problem is formulated in one coordinate system and then transformed into another the resulting estimate xest should transform in the same way. This property is commonly referred to as invariance. Not every triangulation method assures invariance, at least not for general types of coordinate transformations. For a homogeneous representation of 3D coordinates, the most general transformation is a projective transformation, represented by a 4 times 4 matrix mathbf{T} . If the homogeneous coordinates are transformed according to : mathbf{bar x} sim mathbf{T} , mathbf{x} then the camera matrices must transform as (Ck) : mathbf{bar C}_{k} sim mathbf{C}_{k} , mathbf{T}^{-1} to produce the same homogeneous image coordinates (yk) : mathbf{y}_{k} sim mathbf{bar C}_{k} , mathbf{bar x} = mathbf{C}_{k} , mathbf{x} If the triangulation function tau is invariant to mathbf{T} then the following relation must be valid : mathbf{bar x}_{rm est} sim mathbf{T} , mathbf{x}_{rm est} from which follows that : tau(mathbf{y}'_{1}, mathbf{y}'_{2}, mathbf{C}_{1}, mathbf{C}_{2}) sim mathbf{T}^{-1} , tau(mathbf{y}'_{1}, mathbf{y}'_{2}, mathbf{C}_{1} , mathbf{T}^{-1}, mathbf{C}_{2} , mathbf{T}^{-1}), for all mathbf{y}'_{1}, mathbf{y}'_{2} For each triangulation method, it can be determined if this last relation is valid. If it is, it may be satisfied only for a subset of the projective transformations, for example, rigid or affine transformations. = Computational complexity = The function tau is only an abstract representation of a computation which, in practice, may be relatively complex. Some methods result in a tau which is a closed-form continuous function while others need to be decomposed into a series of computational steps involving, for example, SVD or finding the roots of a polynomial. Yet another class of methods results in tau which must rely on iterative estimation of some parameters. This means that both the computation time and the complexity of the operations involved may vary between the different methods.  Some triangulation methods found in the literature  = Mid-point method = Each of the two image points mathbf{y}'_{1} and mathbf{y}'_{2} has a corresponding projection line (blue in the right image above), here denoted as mathbf{L}'_{1} and mathbf{L}'_{2} , which can be determined given the camera matrices mathbf{C}_{1}, mathbf{C}_{2} . Let d, be a distance function between a (3D line) L1' and a x (3D point) such that : d(mathbf{L}, mathbf{x}) = the Euclidean distance between mathbf{L} and mathbf{x} . The midpoint method finds the point xest which minimizes : d(mathbf{L}'_{1}, mathbf{x})^{2} + d(mathbf{L}'_{2}, mathbf{x})^{2} It turns out that xest lies exactly at the middle of the shortest line segment which joins the two projection lines. = Direct linear transformation = = Via the essential matrix = = Optimal triangulation =  References  *  External links  *Two view and multi-view triangulation in Matlab Geometry in computer vision Stereophotogrammetry ","title":"Triangulation (computer vision)"},{"id":"12891060","text":"Justicia galapagana is a species of plant in the family Acanthaceae.

Life De Zayas was born to wealthy and aristocratic parents in Veracruz, Mexico. His father, Rafael de Zayas (1848‚Äì1932), was a noted journalist, novelist, dramatist, poet and lawyer. He established two newspapers in Veracruz, and it was there that his sons Marius and George developed their artistic careers by providing illustrations for the papers. In 1906 the two brothers began providing caricatures for Mexico City's leading newspaper El Diario, which was founded by American-born journalist Benjamin De Casseres. A year later the de Zayas newspapers took a strong editorial stance against Mexican President Porfirio Diaz, and under threat their family left Mexico and settled in New York. Shortly after arriving in New York, de Zayas took a position drawing caricatures for the New York Evening World, and he quickly established a reputation for his witty parodies of prominent citizens. Through his connections with other artists in the city he became acquainted with Alfred Stieglitz, and in January 1909 Stieglitz exhibited a group of de Zayas's caricatures at his art gallery, \\"291\\". A year later Stieglitz gave de Zayas another exhibit in which he brought his caricatures to a three-dimensional level. On a large wooden platform he created more than 100 free-standing cardboard cutouts of some of New York's most prominent people, seen strolling down Fifth Avenue in front of the Plaza Hotel. The show became such a hit that lines were often stretched far outside the doorway to the gallery, and the work remained on display for six months. \\"Mrs Brown-Potter\\" by Marius de Zayas. Published in Camera Work, No 29 1910 In October 1910 de Zayas traveled to Paris, where he stayed for almost a year while scouting out artists and art trends for Stieglitz. It was there that he saw his first work of Cubist art, although he did not at first recall the name of the artist. It turned out that the artist was Picasso, and, because of their common language, de Zayas conducted the first major interview with him two months later. He immediately published an article based upon his interview, and it became the first publication to record Picasso's own views of his work. It was also while in Paris that de Zayas first saw African art, and he recognized its influences on the development of some of the modern art he was seeing there. He proposed an exhibit of African art to Stieglitz, and in 1914 one of the first exhibits of African art as seen in the context of modern art was held at \\"291\\". \\"Rodin and Steichen\\" by Marius de Zayas. Published in Camera Work, No 46, 1914 In 1911 he returned to New York, and as a result of his experiences in Paris he began to explore new, more abstract style of caricature. His new approach resulted in his last but most important exhibit at \\"291\\" in April-May 1913. In the spring of 1914 de Zayas returned to Paris and renewed an earlier friendship with Francis Picabia. The latter introduced de Zayas to his circle of artists and writers, including Guillaume Apollinaire, Gertrude Stein, George Bernard Shaw and Alvin Langdon Coburn. De Zayas was captivated by the new work he saw there, and he once again wrote to Stieglitz and recommended shows for Picabia, Picasso and Georges Braque. De Zayas returned to New York when World War I broke out in Europe later that year. He immediately began collaborating with his friend and colleague Paul Haviland about ways to re-energize the New York art scene, and together with writer and arts patron Agnes Ernst Meyer they convinced Stieglitz to publish a new magazine which would be called 291 in honor of his gallery of the same name. For the next year de Zayas spent a considerable amount of time and energy both editing and creating works of art for the new publication. His interpretations of poems by Meyer and others introduced the concept of visual poetry to the United States. While 291 was an artistic success, it did not attract a wide audience and ceased publication after only twelve issues. 291 Throws Back Its Forelock by Marius de Zayas. Cover of 291, No 1, 1915 During this same period de Zayas convinced Meyer that a new art gallery was needed to further the cause of avant-garde art in New York, and, with her financial support, in October 1915 he opened The Modern Gallery on Fifth Avenue. For the next three years the gallery presented a steady flow of works by Picasso, Picabia, Braque, C√©zanne, van Gogh, Br√¢ncu»ôi, Rivera and other modern artists. Although de Zayas announced his new gallery as \\"an additional expression of '291'\\" Stieglitz saw it as a direct competitor to his own gallery, and as a result his friendship and collaboration with de Zayas deteriorated. During this same time he and Haviland co-authored about a book on modern art, and in 1916 they published A Study of the Modern Evolution of Plastic Expression (New York, 1916). The book has been called \\"one of the first serious attempts to deal with the central problems of modern art.\\" De Zayas changed the name of the Modern Gallery to the De Zayas Gallery in 1919 and continued showing artists for the next two years. When his galleries closed, he returned to Europe and spent the next twenty years in Europe organizing important traveling exhibitions of modern art. In the late 1930s, he married Virginia Harrison, descendant of the railroad tycoon, Charles Crocker. At the insistence of Museum of Modern Art Director Alfred Barr in the 1940s, De Zayas began writing a history of the introduction of modern art to New York. He assembled many notes, comments and photos into a manuscript. The work was published posthumously in 1996. De Zayas returned to the United States after World War II, settling first in Stamford, Connecticut, then in Greenwich, Connecticut. He died in Stamford hospital in 1961 at the age of eighty-one.

The road begins at the West Virginia state line at the North Branch Potomac River opposite Wiley Ford, where the highway continues south as West Virginia Route 28 (WV 28). The parkway runs north to MD 51 within the city of Cumberland. Canal Parkway provides a connection between downtown Cumberland and the South Cumberland neighborhood and with Greater Cumberland Regional Airport, which is located in Mineral County, West Virginia. Canal Parkway was constructed as part of a broad group of projects to revitalize the North Branch Potomac River waterfront of Cumberland, centered on the historical Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O; Canal). The parkway was constructed both as a scenic highway and to improve access to South Cumberland and the airport, which were often cut off from the rest of Cumberland by flooding or traffic jams at the sole connecting point, a railroad underpass on Virginia Avenue. New bridges over the North Branch Potomac River and the C&O; Canal were built in 1992 and 1997, while the portion of Canal Parkway from the canal crossing toward downtown Cumberland was constructed between 1999 and 2001. Route description Canal Parkway begins at the West Virginia state line on a bridge across the North Branch Potomac River between Wiley Ford and the southern edge of the city of Cumberland. The roadway continues south as WV 28 through Wiley Ford toward Greater Cumberland Regional Airport. Canal Parkway heads north as a two-lane highway, crossing the C&O; Canal and its towpath on a Warren truss bridge. The state highway gains a median and intersects River Avenue, part of the old connection from Cumberland to Wiley Ford that serves the South Cumberland neighborhood. No trucks are allowed on the road north of River Avenue. Canal Parkway continues north between the C&O; Canal to the west and an industrial area to the east, both of which are shielded from view by trees and walls. Beyond Elder Street, the state highway reduces to a two-lane road without a median. View north from the south end of Canal Parkway at WV 28 at the West Virginia border on the bridge over the North Branch Potomac River in Cumberland As the parkway is approached by CSX's Cumberland Terminal Subdivision west of the Cumberland rail yard, the parkway ceases to be shielded by trees. Canal Parkway rises onto a retaining wall above the level of the C&O; Canal to the west and on level with the railroad that begins to closely parallel the state highway to the east. The state highway's elevation allows views of the North Branch Potomac River and Knobly Mountain to the west but discourage views of the adjacent C&O; Canal and MD 51 (Industrial Parkway), which parallels the east side of the railroad. Canal Parkway descends from the retaining wall to cross a rail spur from the Cumberland Terminal Subdivision that heads north to Canal Place. The two directions of the state highway split for a partial interchange with MD 51, with the northbound lane passing under MD 51's overpass of the railroad. The northbound lane of Canal Parkway has a right-in/right-out interchange with Wineow Street before merging with westbound MD 51 a short distance south of downtown Cumberland. History View south along Canal Parkway near Elder Street in Cumberland Wiley Ford is named for a shallow spot in the North Branch Potomac River just east of the present bridge over the river. The first bridge at Wiley Ford was constructed around 1908; a replacement bridge was built in the late 1950s. Traffic heading to Wiley Ford from downtown Cumberland travelled Virginia Avenue south from Oldtown Road, the old alignment of MD 51, then followed River Avenue southwest to its present intersection with Canal Parkway, then south across the river along Ford Avenue, which followed the same alignment as Canal Parkway today. In addition to the route suffering from the standard problems of travelling through city streets, Virginia Avenue passed under the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tracks via a low, narrow underpass that was vulnerable to flooding and, due to its location immediately south of Virginia Avenue's intersections with MD 51, was the frequent site of traffic jams. A problem at the underpass isolated South Cumberland south of the tracks from the rest of the city and required a lengthy detour through West Virginia. The same problems also hindered access to Greater Cumberland Regional Airport from the city. Canal Parkway was constructed as part of a broad group of projects to revitalize the North Branch Potomac River waterfront south of downtown Cumberland starting in 1989. These projects included: *The rehabilitation of the C&O; Canal, including its re-watering, through the Cumberland portion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. *Restoration of historic Western Maryland Railway properties, which included restoration of the former Western Maryland Railway Station and establishment of the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, a heritage railroad. *The construction of new bridges across the North Branch Potomac River and C&O; Canal and an automobile parkway along a portion of the canal by the Maryland State Highway Administration to serve as a scenic highway and to improve access to Greater Cumberland Regional Airport. *The construction of Canal Place by the National Park Service to tie together these and other historical properties, including Fort Cumberland and the Downtown Cumberland Historic District. The first section of Canal Parkway to be built was the reconstruction of Ford Avenue from the West Virginia state line to River Avenue. A new bridge over the North Branch Potomac River was completed in 1992. A new bridge over the C&O; Canal was completed in 1997, eliminating an at-grade crossing of the highway and the C&O; Canal towpath. Construction of Canal Parkway from River Avenue to MD 51 was underway by 1999 and completed in 2001, at which time the highway received the unsigned MD 61 designation. Junction list Auxiliary routes MD 61 originally had two auxiliary routes. Both routes were transferred to municipal maintenance in 2005. *MD 61A was the designation for an unnamed connector west from the intersection of MD 61 and River Avenue to serve properties between the highway and the C&O; Canal. *MD 61B was the designation for a section of River Avenue immediately east of its intersection with MD 61.

Lamme created an efficient induction motor from Nikola Tesla's patents and went on to design the giant Niagara Falls generators and motors and the power plant of the Manhattan Elevated Railway in New York City. Biography Lamme was born on a farm near Springfield, Ohio, on 12 January 1864. From an early age he tinkered with machinery and made experiments of his ideas on the Lamme family farm. He liked things that rotated, especially at high speed. In later years he was able to solve complex problems in his engineering work using mental calculations. Lamme graduated from Olive Branch High School near New Carlisle, Ohio in 1883 and subsequently entered Ohio State University and graduated with an engineering degree in 1888. In early 1889, Lamme read an article about Westinghouse forming the Philadelphia Natural Gas Company of Pittsburgh. Westinghouse hired Lamme and within a few months transferred him to the Westinghouse Electric Company. Lamme took over the stalled project of developing a practical version of Nikola Tesla's patented induction motor from Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and came up with a more efficient cage winding design.Donald Scott McPartland, Almost Edison: How William Sawyer and Others Lost the Race to Electrification, ProQuest - 2006, page 325 Over a period of several years, he designed a variety of electrical motors and generators. Among his eight US patents were inventions on induction motors, electrical ship propulsion, and Gyroscopic stabilizer systems. He designed the single-reduction motor for street railways (replacing the double-reduction motors), the Rotary Converter, railroad electrification systems, the Westinghouse Type C Induction Motor, and the first 5000 kW generators for the giant hydroelectric generators in the Adams Power Plant at Niagara Falls, for many years the largest power station in the world. Bertha Lamme Feicht worked alongside her brother in the design of the turbogenerator at Niagara Falls. Operation began locally in 1895 and power was transmitted to Buffalo, New York, in 1896.Electricity and its Development at Niagara Falls at ublib.buffalo.edu Lamme spent many years developing advanced analysis and computational methods for designing and predicting the performance of electrical machines, doing much of the work at night because he had other duties assigned to him during the day.Lamme, Autobiography Among other available employees, no one else seemed able to do the computational work, so Bertha, who like her brother Benjamin had an engineering degree from Ohio State University, was recruited to aid with the computation.Lamme, p. 91 After a few years, she left Westinghouse to get married. The importance of Lamme's methodology was realized in 1893 when Westinghouse began designing the first Niagara Falls 5000 kW generators. Lamme designed much of the apparatus for the Westinghouse exhibit at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, including alternating-current generators, induction motors, and rotary converters. In addition to his design work on the Niagara Falls alternators, Lamme designed the ‚Äúmonster machines‚Äù for the power plant of the Manhattan Elevated Railway in New York City. Lamme became chief engineer at Westinghouse in 1903 and held the position for the rest of his life. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railway adopted the Lamme‚Äôs single- phase electric rail system in 1905. In 1915, Lamme was nominated by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE, in 1963 merged into IEEE) and was appointed by the Secretary of the Navy to represent the AIEE on the Naval Consulting Board. Lamme died July 8, 1924 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the age of 60. In his will, he established the AIEE Lamme Medal to recognize members of the AIEE for 'meritorious achievement in the development of electrical apparatus or machinery.' His will also provided for a gold medal to be awarded by the American Society for Engineering Education for accomplishment in technical teaching. Career As technology advanced, one of Mr. Lamme‚Äôs responsibilities was to recruit, evaluate, and train new engineering graduates employed by the Westinghouse Company. He developed criteria for selecting the most talented persons for the design engineering work. He developed and taught the Westinghouse Engineering Course in which those selected spent full-time for six months. Lamme‚Äôs great interest in the people with whom he worked was returned by their affection, esteem and admiration for him as a great engineer. He was addressed by his friends and colleagues as well as his family by the affectionate ‚ÄúB.G.‚Äù Lamme was very fond of classical music and accumulated a large collection of records. Awards Lamme received the IEEE Edison Medal on May 16, 1919, in the Auditorium of the Engineering Societies Building-the site that preceded the United Engineering Building of recent times-in New York City. The citation was ‚ÄúFor Invention and Development of Electrical Machinery.‚Äù The Edison Medal is presented for ‚Äúa career of meritorious achievements in electrical science or electrical engineering or electrical arts.‚Äù On January 12, 1923 Ohio State University presented Mr. Lamme with the Joseph Sullivant Medal; the initial presentation of that award. He received the 1918 AIEE Edison Medal for his contributions to the electrical power field. Lamme never married and made his home with his sisters. His sister and fellow Ohio State graduate, Bertha Lamme Feicht (1869‚Äì1943) was the nation‚Äôs first woman electrical engineer and the first woman who graduated in a major field of engineering other than areas related to civil engineering. She worked at Westinghouse as an electrical design engineer under her brother‚Äôs direction until her marriage to fellow Westinghouse engineer, Russel Feicht. Bertha worked on the turbogenerator for the Niagara Falls project. In his will he also provided that a gold medal be presented annually to a technical graduate of his alma mater, Ohio State University, for \\"meritorious achievement in engineering.\\"  Engineering papers  * Electrical Engineering papers (Westinghouse, Pittsburgh, 1919) US Patents * Control system, 1924 * Gyroscopic stabilizer system, 1922 * Driving system for gyroscopic stabilization, 1922 * Means for preventing commutator flashing, 1921 * System of electrical ship propulsion, 1921 * Speed control for induction motors, 1921 * Speed control for induction motors, 1920 * Speed control for induction motors, 1920 See also * IEEE Lamme Medal References Sources *IEEE Global History Network - Benjamin G.
