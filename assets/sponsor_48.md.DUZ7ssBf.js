Deadweight tonnage (also known as deadweight; abbreviated to DWT, D.W.T., d.w.t., or dwt) or tons deadweight (DWT) is a measure of how much weight a ship can carry. It is the sum of the weights of cargo, fuel, fresh water, ballast water, provisions, passengers, and crew. DWT is often used to specify a ship's maximum permissible deadweight (i.e. when it is fully loaded so that its Plimsoll line is at water level), although it may also denote the actual DWT of a ship not loaded to capacity. Definition Deadweight tonnage is a measure of a vessel's weight carrying capacity, not including the empty weight of the ship. It is distinct from the displacement (weight of water displaced), which includes the ship's own weight, or the volumetric measures of gross tonnage or net tonnage (and the legacy measures gross register tonnage and net register tonnage). Deadweight tonnage was historically expressed in long tonsOne long ton (LT) is but is now usually given internationally in tonnes (metric tons). In modern international shipping conventions such as the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, deadweight is explicitly defined as the difference in tonnes between the displacement of a ship in water of a specific gravity of 1.025 (corresponding to average density of sea water) at the draft corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard and the light displacement (lightweight) of the ship.

At in size, it is the 107th largest island in the world, and Canada's 24th largest island. The island has areas of federal crown land and areas of private land owned by Inuit, however, the last permanent residents left in the 1970s. With no permanent settlements, the island is also the largest uninhabited island in the northern hemisphere south of the Arctic Circle. It was the last home of the Sadlermiut people who are widely believed to represent the Dorset culture. Geography Coats Island is long. It reaches a maximum elevation of 185 m above sea level. This high point occurs along the rocky northern perimeter between Cape Pembroke and Cape Prefontaine. The underlying rocks in this area are Precambrian metamorphics. Less than 5% of the island is more than above sea level. The southern half of the island is primarily low-lying muskeg and made up of Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks, such as limestone and sandstone. Fauna Since 1920, Coats Island has been designated a caribou reserve. After caribou were extirpated from nearby Southampton Island, the Coats herd was used to re-establish the Southampton herd. It is also known for its population of thick-billed murre. Two colonies of 30,000 birds occur along the cliffs at the rocky northern end. There are also significant concentrations of walrus at walrus haulouts at the base of cliffs or on offshore islands at the northern end of the island (one each at Cape Pembroke and Cape Prefontaine). These are visited regularly by Inuit from the hamlet at Coral Harbour, on Southampton Island, for harvesting. Cape Pembroke is an Important Bird Area. History The first recorded sighting of Coats Island was by Thomas Button in 1612; he explored it further the following year. It received its name from William Coats, a sea captain for the Hudson's Bay Company. He visited the area periodically between 1727 and 1751. In 1824, HMS Griper, under Captain George Francis Lyon, anchored off Cape Pembroke on Coats Island. The whalers then discovered a band of \\"Eskimos\\" who were said to have spoken a \\"strange dialect\\" and were called Sadlermiut. Since then, the Sadlermiut continued to establish contact with Westerners. However, as with many North American aboriginals, the Sadlermiut were often susceptible to Western diseases. The area was confirmed to be an island by American whalers, who began visiting the area in the 1860s. By 1896, there were only 70 of Sadlermiut remaining. Then, in the fall of 1902, the British trading/whaling vessel named the Active had made a stop at Cape Low, Southampton Island. It is said that some of the Sadlermiut caught a disease, possibly an influenza, typhoid or typhus, from a sick sailor aboard the Active, which then spread to the entire community. By winter 1902-03, the entire Sadlermiut population had died as a result. A Hudson's Bay Company trading post was maintained on the island from August 1920 to August 1924, and a number of Inuit families lived on the island during that period, some of whom had been brought from Baffin Island on boats. In 1921, an overturned fisherman's dory covering two skeletons was found by Capt. George Cleveland on Coats Island which were alleged to be the remains of Captain Arthur Gibbons and one of his officers, survivors of the wreck of the American whaling schooner A. T.

Zachary Taylor, later the twelfth President of the United States, was a commander of the unit. The motto, \\"Regulars, By God!\\" derives from the Battle of Chippawa, in which British Major General Phineas Riall noticed that the approaching regiment had on the uniforms of militia, which the British had defeated at Queenston Heights. Instead, the Americans pressed the attack. Riall is believed to have said, \\"Those are Regulars, By God!\\", though the only source of this was opposing U.S. General Winfield Scott.  Overview  The regiment participated in the War of 1812, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the American Civil War, the Indian Wars (1823-1879), the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War (1899‚Äì1913), the Pancho Villa Expedition (1916‚Äì1917), World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War. Elements of the 6th Infantry were also part of IFOR, Task Force Eagle, which was charged with implementing the military aspects of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 1989, the 4th Battalion 6th Infantry deployed to Panama, playing a key role in Operation Just Cause. In January 1994, the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry deployed to Macedonia for Operation Able Sentry as part of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force. In May 1998, Company B was deployed again to Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Joint Forge (OJE/OJF). In 1999, elements were deployed again to Macedonia for the initial launch of support and liberation of Kosovo. In March 2003, Company C, 2nd Battalion deployed with HQ V Corps to Kuwait and participated in the initial invasion of Iraq. The rest of the 2nd Battalion and 1st Battalion deployed to Iraq in late April 2003 as part of 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division. The \\"Regulars\\" arrived in Baghdad in May 2003 and were the first to relieve elements of the 3rd Infantry Division in Baghdad. The 1st and 2nd Battalions deployed again in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in November 2005 and April 2008. The 4th Battalion, 6th Infantry deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom/New Dawn from May 2009 to May 2010. In August 2011, the 4th Battalion deployed to Al-Asad and FOB Hammer in Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn. They returned in December of that year when the U.S and Iraqi government failed to come to an agreement concerning soldiers diplomatic immunity, making the Regulars one of the last units to withdraw from the Iraq. Two battalions of the 6th Infantry Regiment are currently assigned to the 1st Armored Division; the 1st Battalion with the 2d Brigade Combat Team and the 4th Battalion with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team. Lineage=Pre-World War I ;Lineage Constituted 11 January 1812 in the Regular Army as the 11th Infantry Regiment. Organized March‚ÄìMay 1812 in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. Consolidated May‚ÄìOctober 1815 with the 25th Infantry (constituted 26 June 1812) and the 27th, 29th, and 37th Infantry (all constituted 29 January 1813) to form the 6th Infantry Regiment. The lineages of the units that made up the 6th Infantry give the regiment campaign credit for the War of 1812. Consolidated 1 May 1869 with the 42d Infantry Regiment, Veteran Reserve Corps (constituted 21 September 1866), and consolidated unit designated as the 6th Infantry Regiment. ;Narrative The present 6th United States Infantry traces its lineage back to 11 January 1812, when the Congress authorized a strengthening of the regular Army in preparation for the conflict that became known as the War of 1812. The unit was first known as the 11th Infantry Regiment and served as such on the Upper Canada‚ÄìUS border throughout the War of 1812. In 1831 and 1832, the regiment entered the series of actions to be known as the Black Hawk War, against the Sac and Fox Indians. On 2 August 1832, the 6th Infantry caught the Indians at the junction of the Bad Axe River with the Mississippi River (in present-day Wisconsin), and killed most of Black Hawk's band (records say that 950 Sac were massacred), earning the campaign streamer BLACK HAWK. In 1837, the units of the regiment left Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, for Florida via Louisiana. As part of a force commanded by Colonel Zachary Taylor, the regiment entered the Second Seminole War in eastern Florida in 1837. It was the first \\"guerrilla-style\\" war fought by US troops. *1848 A Company was sent from Fort Snelling to construct Fort Ripley. *In 1850 E Company was sent from Fort Snelling to build and garrison Fort Dodge. *In 1853 E Co. deactivated Fort Dodge and went north to assist Companies C and K build Fort Ridgely. C *The 6th Infantry Regiment served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, participating in Scott's campaign to Mexico City. They fought in the Siege of Veracruz, at Cerro Gordo, Churubusco, Molino del Rey and at Chapultepec. From late 1860 to mid-1861 detachments of Company B from Fort Humboldt were involved in the Bald Hills War, patrolling and in 1861, skirmishing with the local Indians on Mad and Eel Rivers and their tributaries. At the outset of the Civil War in April 1861, the regiment was directed to hurry eastward from Oregon and California and join the Federal forces. According to one biographer of the time, \\"Several of the Regiment's best and bravest officers, honest in the mistaken construction of the Constitution and true to their convictions as to their duty, had tendered their resignations and given themselves to the Confederate cause.\\" One of those officers was the regimental commander, Major Lewis Armistead. During the Civil War, the 6th U.S. Infantry Regiment lost during service 2 officers and 29 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 1 officer and 43 enlisted men by disease. Total lost: 75. For six years after the Civil War, the regiment served at various stations in Georgia and South Carolina. *Company G would be at Fort Buford, North Dakota 1n 1870. *It moved to Fort Hays, Kansas, in October 1871. The regiment saw duty on the frontier in Kansas, Colorado, Iowa, Wyoming, Idaho and Utah. *In 1872 under Col. William B. Hazen, the regiment was transferred to the Department of Dakota and based out of Fort Buford Dakota Territory, fighting many engagements against hostile Indian forces. *In 1872 B & C Companies built Fort McKeen, North Dakota which was renamed Fort Abraham Lincoln. *In 1872 and 1873, the regiment earned campaign streamers NORTH DAKOTA 1872 and NORTH DAKOTA 1873. The next several years saw much action for the regiment during the Indian Wars many of which in Montana Territory, and they were awarded campaign streamers MONTANA 1879, LITTLE BIG HORN, CHEYENNES, and UTES. Members of the 6th and 16th marching homewards after the end of the Mexican Expedition *In 1880, the regiment moved to Fort Thomas, Kentucky, where it remained until called to action again in June 1898, in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. On 1 July 1898, the 6th Regiment took the brunt of the fighting during the charge up San Juan Hill. The regiment returned to the United States, serving at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, from the end of 1898 until late July 1899, when it sailed to the Philippines to help quell the insurgents in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. The Moro tribe was one of the toughest enemies the 6th had ever faced‚Äîevery one of them fought to the death, and preferred to do it in hand-to-hand style. The regiment fought over fifty engagements, and it left with campaign streamers for JOLO, NEGROS in 1899, and PANAY in 1900. In March 1905, the regiment returned to the Philippines to fight the Moros again. For three days in 1906, elements of the regiment fought in the First Battle of Bud Dajo, one of the fiercest conflicts of the entire island campaign. The successful ending to the battle broke the Moro strength and ended the fighting in that part of the island. One 6th Infantry soldier received the Medal of Honor for service in the Philippines: Captain Bernard A. Byrne, 19 July 1899, Bobong, Negros Following service in the Philippines, the 6th returned to the Presidio of San Francisco, California. In May 1914, it entered into service on the Mexican border. In March 1916, it proceeded to San Antonio, Chihuahua, as part of the Punitive Expedition under Brigadier General John J. Pershing. In February 1917, Pershing's force withdrew from Mexico and the regiment moved to Fort Bliss. Because of their action, the regiment was awarded another campaign streamer ‚Äì MEXICO 1916‚Äì1917. World War I ;Lineage Assigned 18 November 1917 to the 5th Division ;Narrative In December 1917, the 6th Regiment was assigned to the 10th Infantry Brigade, 5th Division, and began training stateside. In the latter part of May 1917, the 6th Infantry Regiment was declared ready for introduction to combat and was placed at the disposal of the French for service at the front. In July 1918, a strategic offensive plan was agreed upon by the Allied commanders, the immediate purpose of which was to reduce the salients which interfered with further offensive operations. One of these was the Saint-Mihiel salient. The First U.S. Army was organized on 10 August and directed to launch an offensive on 12 September to reduce this salient. The 6th Regiment was destined to play an important role in this operation. On 1 December 1918 the 6th Regiment conducted a march from Luxembourg to the city of Trier, Germany, becoming the first American troops to enter that ancient city. Inter-war period ;Lineage Relieved in August 1921 from assignment to the 5th Division Assigned 24 March 1923 to the 6th Division Relieved 16 October 1939 from assignment to the 6th Division Reorganized 15 July 1940 as the 6th Infantry Regiment (Armored) and assigned to the 1st Armored Division Redesignated 1 January 1942 as the 6th Armored Infantry Regiment ;Narrative Between World War I and World War II, the regiment returned to the United States, where they continued to train to in various exercises as the Army began to experiment with mechanized and motorized infantry formations. In 1936, they were designated a mechanized unit by the War Department, and they left the 6th Infantry Division to join the 1st Armored Division on 15 July 1940. In February 1941, the regiment was stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, conducting routine training and activities under the command of Col. Harry B. Crea. In April, the regiment began supplying cadre for the 51st Infantry Regiment of the 4th Armored Division, which was to be stationed at Pine Camp, New York. In May, the regiment continued to get replacements and conduct routine training. The regiment consisted of a regimental headquarters, an antitank company, the regimental band, and two battalions ‚Äì each with a headquarters company and four line companies. In August, the regiment moved to Louisiana to conduct maneuvers, then returned to Fort Knox in November. The 6th Infantry was pivotal in developing mechanized infantry tactics during their training with the 1st Armored Division, and this training was soon to pay off. A few weeks later, on 7 December 1941, war was declared when the Empire of Japan attacked the US fleet at Pearl Harbor, with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declaring war on the United States soon after. Soldiers awaiting release were returned to their barracks, knowing that they'd be heading for war. World War II The 1st Armored Division was one of the first American units to sail across the Atlantic to do battle with the Axis. Leaving from Fort Dix, New Jersey on 11 April 1942, the Old Ironsides patch set foot on European soil in Northern Ireland on 16 May 1942. Here, they trained with a new intensity as they prepared to go into battle for the first time. =Algeria-French Morocco= Map showing the movements of the Center Task Force in Operation Torch. On 8 November 1942, almost a full year after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Allied American, Free French, and British armies launched Operation Torch, the seaborne invasion of French North Africa. The 6th Armored Infantry Regiment was commanded by COL Claud E. Stadtman at this time, and his force was divided into different Combat Commands and Task Forces. 3rd Battalion-6th Infantry (3-6 IN), under the command of LTC George F. Marshall, was assigned to Operation Reservist with the mission of sailing directly into the Oran harbor and capturing valuable facilities and ships before the Vichy French could mount an effective resistance. The amphibious assault began shortly after 0200, but one landing craft‚Äôs engine caught fire, alerting the defenders to their presence. They were met with a devastating volley from the French shore defenses which also managed to destroy their Royal Navy escort ships, the HMS Hartland and the HMS Walney. Out of 393, 9 officers were killed (including LTC Marshall), 180 enlisted men were killed, and 5 officers and 152 enlisted men were wounded. Only 47 men survived unscathed. For their outstanding courage under fire in their first action of WWII, 3-6 IN was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation, but ceased to exist as a fighting unit for the time being. Despite this disaster, the other landings of Operation Torch were still scheduled to be underway in the morning, and the vehicles and men of General Lunsford E. Oliver's Task Force Red (TF Red) began landing at Z Beach to the east of Oran in the Gulf of Arzew with the mission of seizing the Tafaraoui airfield. Attached to this TF was E Company, 2nd Battalion-6th Armored Infantry (2-6 IN) under CPT Donald A. Kersting. 1LT R. H. Leed's 1st Platoon, E/2-6 IN was the advance guard for the Task Force, and they managed to reach the airfield by 1100. Attacking alongside elements of the 1st Battalion-1st Armored Regiment, LT Leeb's Platoon rolled onto the airfield from the east while 2nd and 3rd PLTs (under LTs J. F. Sullivan and Jesse E. Frank respectively) blocked off approaches from Oran and managed to capture an enemy ammunition train. TF Red's initial objective had been accomplished. To the west of Oran, 1st Battalion-6th Armored Infantry (1-6 IN), under the command of LTC William B. Kern, was assigned to TF Green, and they quickly assaulted and captured Y Beach without opposition. B Company was detached from 1-6 IN and joined 1st Battalion-13th Armored Regiment in their push to secure La Senia airfield, but the flying column was delayed by French anti-tank guns, forcing TF Green to halt for the day. A platoon from E Co to the east was brought to help secure the airfield on 9 November. On 10 November, TF Red and TF Green converged on Oran. In the initial push into Oran, A Company (under CPT Thomas Hoban), as well as the Battalion cannon platoon for 1-6 IN supported TF Green's attack. Oran was secured by 1215 after French hold-outs and snipers were cleared from the city. At this point, many of the Vichy French soldiers joined the Free French and the Allied cause, and the Vichy government was dissolved by the Germans. The Vichy soldiers fought halfheartedly against an erstwhile enemy they didn't hate, but the 6th Armored Infantry Regiment's next enemy would not be so easy. =Tunisia= After the Vichy French forces were defeated in Algeria, Allied efforts moved east, toward Tunisia. In a series of rapid thrusts beginning on 24 November, elements of the 1st Armored Division and other Allied units began advancing on Tunis. Despite early American success, a German-Italian force under General Wolfgang Fischer counterattacked on 1 December, driving Allied units back. LTC McGinness‚Äô 2-6 Infantry arrived in the area that afternoon and began staging for an Allied counterattack. The next day, 2 December, Axis units began harassing Allied lines of communication along the Medjez-el-Bab- Tebourba road, so LTC Kern‚Äôs 1-6 Infantry was sent to destroy them, which they did with the help of C Bty, 27th Armored Field Artillery Battalion. By 4 December, the enemy had retaken the town of Tebourba, and the Allied forces rushed to get into defensive positions after plans for a counterattack were abandoned. 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 6th Armored Infantry formed the main body of this defensive line, supported by elements of the 1st Armored Regiment, 13th Armored Regiment, 27th Field Artillery, and 701st Tank Destroyer Battalion. LTC Kern‚Äôs 1-6 Infantry, supported by B and C Bty, 27th Artillery, occupied the most exposed position of the Allied line at Djebel el Guessa and Djebel bou Aoukaz. Between these two hill masses, there lies an east-west pass that enemy forces would need to seize if they were to pierce the Allied line. The Battalion was strung out over five miles and the platoons were separated by deep ravines and would have difficulty supporting each other. On the morning of 5 December, a clear cool day, 1-6 IN came under enemy observation and endured heavy mortar and artillery fire, a sign that the enemy was soon to attack. A Co, under CPT Hoban, spotted enemy digging in to the north of Djebel el Guessa, so LTC Kern moved B Co, under CPT Walter Geyer, onto the ridge behind A Co to gain depth in his defense. After a night of continual illumination from flares, the Germans attacked on the morning of 6 December at roughly 0800. A combined attack from Stuka dive-bombers, infantry, and tanks hit A Co. Seven Panzers attacked through a gap in the ridgeline, isolating 3rd Platoon and allowing German infantry to advance up the sheltered ravines. At 0900, another German armored attack twice the size of the first one attacked C Co, under CPT George Miller, from multiple directions. This attack left C Co disorganized and the Germans seemed likely to cut off 1-6 IN‚Äôs route of escape. Allied armored elements began massing to counterattack on other parts of the line. For hours, 1-6 IN held on to their positions. A Co was temporarily relieved when it pulled in its left flank by using the Battalion machine-gun platoon to pin down enemy infantry. After a counterattack by B Co‚Äôs halftracks, A Co successfully withdrew to the ridge held by B Co. To the south, C Bty, 27th Artillery fired support missions for C Co, 1-6 IN temporarily checking the German advance and allowing CPT Miller‚Äôs company to reorganize, but at the cost of the destruction of the Battery from German counterfire. Meanwhile, the Battalion Reconnaissance Platoon began seeking a ford in the Medjerda River to bring in armored reinforcements. 1-6 IN‚Äôs one remaining assault gun fired and maneuvered against the German vehicles, and despite not destroying any of them, the crew delayed their advance long enough to allow arriving reinforcements to cross the river without being fired upon. Finally, E Co, 2-6 IN arrived at 1117 and forded the Medjerda River but were forced to leave all their vehicles behind. The rest of LTC McGinness‚Äô Battalion arrived and forced the river at 1228. With the arrival of these fresh infantrymen and some tanks from 2-13 Armor, the Germans temporarily withdrew, allowing LTC Kern to reorganize his exhausted Battalion on the flat terrain behind the armor. The Americans then counterattacked but were severely defeated by German defensive positions and anti-tank guns, leaving many destroyed M3 Lee tanks behind, burning under the desert sky. The losses of the day had been severe. A Co and B Co had suffered heavily, and CPT Geyer had been wounded. C Co‚Äôs Commander, CPT Miller, had been killed, and the company had lost many men and much of its equipment. Despite this, 1st Battalion-6th Armored Infantry Regiment had performed bravely in their defense against superior enemy armored units, and their exploits would go down in 1st Armored Division history. =Italy= They landed in Italy on 28 October 1943. The regiment remained there until it was reorganized on 20 July 1944 and its elements were redesignated as elements of the 1st Armored Division as follows: * 6th Armored Infantry Regiment (less 2d and 3d Battalions) as the 6th Armored Infantry Battalion * 2d Battalion as the 11th Armored Infantry Battalion * 3d Battalion as the 14th Armored Infantry Battalion One soldier of the 6th Armored Infantry Regiment and its successor battalions received the Medal of Honor for service during World War II; Private Nicholas Minue, Company A, 6th Armored Infantry Regiment, 28 April 1943, near Medjez el Bab, Tunisia (posthumous) After the war, the above units underwent changes as follows: * 6th Armored Infantry Battalion converted and redesignated 1 May 1946 as the 12th Constabulary Squadron; concurrently relieved from assignment to the 1st Armored Division and assigned to the 1st Constabulary Regiment. Inactivated 20 September 1947 in Germany. Converted and redesignated 10 October 1950 as the 6th Infantry (less 2d and 3d Battalions) and relieved from assignment to the 1st Constabulary Regiment * 11th Armored Infantry Battalion converted and redesignated 1 May 1946 as the 11th Constabulary Squadron; concurrently relieved from assignment to the 1st Armored Division and assigned to the 1st Constabulary Regiment. Inactivated 20 September 1947 in Germany Converted and redesignated 7 April 1949 as the 11th Armored Infantry Battalion and relieved from assignment the 1st Constabulary Regiment. Redesignated 10 October 1950 as the 2d Battalion, 6th Infantry * 14th Armored Infantry Battalion converted and redesignated 1 May 1946 as the 14th Constabulary Squadron; concurrently relieved from assignment to the 1st Armored Division and assigned to the 15th Constabulary Regiment. Inactivated 20 December 1948 in Germany and relieved from assignment to the 15th Constabulary Regiment; concurrently converted and redesignated as the 14th Armored Infantry Battalion and assigned to the 1st Armored Division Redesignated 10 December 1950 as the 3d Battalion, 6th Infantry, and relieved from assignment to the 1st Armored Division Post World War II ;Lineage 6th Infantry activated 16 October 1950 in Germany. Reorganized 1 June 1958 as a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. Withdrawn 16 June 1989 from the Combat Arms Regimental System and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System. ;Narrative In October 1950 the 6th Infantry was reconstituted as a regular infantry regiment forming the U.S. garrison in West Berlin, designated as Berlin Command. The existing garrison units, the 16th Constabulary Squadron and the 3rd Battalion, 16th Infantry, were reflagged as the 1st and 3rd Battalions, 6th Infantry. The 2nd Battalion was assembled from troops in West Germany. In 1958 Berlin Command was reorganized as a Pentomic unit. The 6th Regiment was reorganized as the 2nd and 3rd Battle Groups, 6th Infantry. The 1st Battalion (1st Battle Group) was changed to 1st Armored Rifle Battalion. On 1 December 1961 the occupation forces were designated Berlin Brigade. In 1964, Berlin Brigade was reorganized again. 2nd and 3rd Battle Groups were redesignated 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 6th Infantry, and 4th Battalion was also formed from cadre of the two battle groups. Vietnam War On 17 May 1967, the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry was reorganized as a standard Infantry Battalion and was assigned to the 198th Light Infantry Brigade, in the Americal (23rd Infantry) Division. The 1‚Äì6th Infantry was the division's first element ashore, arriving at Chu Lai in October to participate in its thirty- fifth campaign and ninth war. After a brief initial operation south of Duc Pho, the battalion was assigned the mission of securing the installation at Chu Lai. 1‚Äì6th Infantry participated in Task Force Oregon, Task Force Miracle, Operation Wheeler/Wallowa, Operation Burlington Trail, and had the mission of protecting Americal Division Headquarters and Chu Lai Defense Command from enemy ground mortar and rocket attacks. The 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry was awarded the Valorous Unit Citation for its victory at the Battle of Lo Giang, 7‚Äì11 February 1968. Task Force Miracle was formed in February 1968 during the enemy's Tet Offensive when the city of Da Nang was threatened by the 60th Main Force Viet Cong Battalion. The 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry and 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry assisted the Marines in the fighting. After four days of fierce fighting, the threat to Da Nang was obliterated and the task force was deactivated and returned to the Americal area of operation. During the Vietnam War, the Sixth was awarded streamers ‚Äì COUNTEROFFENSIVE PHASE III, TET COUNTEROFFENSIVE, COUNTEROFFENSIVE PHASE IV, COUNTEROFFENSIVE PHASE V, COUNTEROFFENSIVE PHASE VI, TET 69 / COUNTEROFFENSIVE, SUMMER-FALL 1969, WINTER-SPRING 1970, SANCTUARY COUNTEROFFENSIVE, COUNTEROFFENSIVE PHASE VII, and CONSOLIDATION I. On 15 February 1969, the battalion was released from the 198th Light Infantry Brigade and assigned to the 23rd Infantry Division, Americal Division. Cold War On 13 September 1972 was reassigned to the 1st Armored Division, and was posted at Stork Barracks in Illesheim, West Germany. During 1st Armored Division's closing months at Ft.

In November 2005, the 1st and 2nd Battalion's 6th Infantry Regiment deployed to Kuwait where they remained assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1AD, and served as part of the regional quick reaction force (QRF) stationed at Camp Buehring, Kuwait. By Spring 2006 the situation in Iraq deteriorated, leading to the call forward of the regional (QRF) in Kuwait. From there, Bravo Company 2-6 IN \\"Death Dealers\\" were sent to Ramadi, Iraq (via TQ Air Base) and operationally assigned to Task Force 1-35 Armor, Commanded by LTC Tony Deane. Bravo, 2-6 IN 'Death Dealers' or \\"Team Dealer\\" were assigned the hotly contested Al Tamim District of Ramadi's West side. Nearly a city unto itself, Tamim was 25 Sq Miles of mostly AQI controlled city. The Team Dealer Mission was to destroy enemy forces, and recapture territory seized by the enemy (AQI, a precursor to ISIL), while securing the local population helping to rebuilding relationships with local leaders. During that time the Regulars operated out of the four main U.S. bases in the area: Camp Ramadi, Blue Diamond, Corregidor, and COP Dealer. These three bases provided the Regulars a triangle-shaped perimeter from which to launch operations into the center of the city of Ramadi. Instead of a Fallujah-style sweep, the combat outpost style of fighting was used where the Regulars created patrol bases deep inside various neighborhoods of the city form which to stage operations, pull security, and draw contact. The soldiers split their time between operating out of the combat outposts and re-fitting and operating from the main bases. B Company 2-6 IN \\"Team Dealer\\" owned and controlled it Battlespace, Ta'meem. The regulars of Team Dealer were never attached to the command of other units. All units planning operations in Ta'mem, including NSW (Seals) and other SOF or OGA unit always reported to Team Dealer to before planning ops in Tameem. And Team Dealer leadership had command and controlled of all operations in Tameem. Team Dealer respectfully and gratefully partnered with many other tactical units in Ramadi‚ÄîEnablers such as NSW, Navy Seals, EOD, Marine Anglico and dog teams. At no point was there a question who was in operational control while on patrol. In fact Team Dealer ran its own separate Tactical Operations Center, separate from that of the Battalion Task Force. Tameem belong to Dealer, because our Soldiers patrolled it every day and expertly knew battlefield and enemy. And it was precisely because Team Dealer brought so much fire power to the fight that we made final operational decisions.

The film became the highest- grossing David Mamet-directed film in the United Stateshttps://web.archive.org/web/20150921210011/http://www.hollywood.com/movies/box- office-analysis-nov-11-57232728/, and then went on to become a popular hit in the home video market.https://web.archive.org/web/20021216041748/http://us.imdb.com/Charts/video020609 Plot Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) runs a ring of professional thieves, which includes Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo), Don \\"Pinky\\" Pincus (Ricky Jay) and Joe's wife Fran (Rebecca Pidgeon). During a robbery of a New York City jewelry store, Joe's face is captured by a security camera after he takes off his mask in an attempt to distract the store's last remaining employee. As both the picture and a witness can identify him, Joe retires from crime and plans to disappear on his sail boat with his wife. This does not sit well with Joe's fence, Mickey Bergman (Danny DeVito), who runs a garment business as a front. After accruing a number of expenses in setting up another robbery, Bergman decides to withhold the payment due to Joe and his crew. He insists they go through with the other job ‚Äî robbing an airplane carrying a large shipment of gold. Bergman further insists that his nephew, Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell), be a part of the crew. Joe accepts, but a series of shifting loyalties changes the complexity of their task, including Jimmy's interest in Joe's wife and Bergman and Jimmy's belief that Joe's skills are declining. They attempt to rob the plane twice. In their first attempt, while setting up explosive devices along the border of the airport, they are stopped by a passing officer. While Joe and Bobby talk the officer into leaving, an agitated Jimmy draws his gun but is stopped by Pinky. He forces his team out of finishing the job after he finds out that Pinky didn't destroy the getaway car, covered in the team's fingerprints. Bergman doesn't accept the team's departure and forces them to finish the job. The plane robbery is a series of misdirects. Pinky poses as a guard while Joe, Bobby, and Jimmy pose as airport security personnel. They stop the jet, pretending to be responding to an emergency. They fill a van with what they take from the plane, then move the van to a rented garage on the airport grounds, where they re-brand it and call for a tow truck to have it hauled away. Jimmy betrays the others to steal the gold and Fran. He knocks out Joe and tells Fran he knew Joe changed the plan, including Fran seducing him. He and Fran take the van, but Jimmy finds out that the hidden compartments are filled with metal washers. Joe avoids arrest and returns to the plane in disguise. He and Bobby remove a shipment of goods they had booked on board the same Swiss flight, which they insist now must be driven to its destination due to the plane's delay. Inside the shipment is the stolen gold, which Joe and Bobby melt into long rods. Bergman apprehends Pinky, who is walking his niece to the school bus. Pinky discloses the plan in order to save his niece, though he is killed after. Bergman and his crew arrive at Joe's sail boat along with Jimmy and Fran, where they hold Joe at gunpoint. They assume that the boat's golden railings are the gold. Fran leaves with Jimmy, pleading with Bergman to let Joe go. Just as Bergman discovers that the railings are not the gold, a hidden Bobby opens fire. Bergman's men are killed and Joe kills Bergman. Bobby gives Joe the address to send his share. Joe waits to meet Fran with a truck filled with black-painted rods. Fran has taken up with Jimmy for real and they take the truck from Joe at gunpoint. Joe gets into a second truck to leave. A black bar in the truck scrapes the garage door, revealing gold underneath. Joe lifts a tarp in the truck bed, revealing the gold rods. He covers the rods with the tarpaulin and drives away. Cast * Gene Hackman as Joe Moore * Danny DeVito as Mickey Bergman * Delroy Lindo as Bobby Blane * Rebecca Pidgeon as Fran Moore * Sam Rockwell as Jimmy Silk * Ricky Jay as Pinky Production Franchise Pictures agreed to finance the film as long as it starred Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito.

This movie is made out of fresh ingredients, not cake mix. Despite the twists of its plot, it is about its characters.\\" He went on to praise Mamet's trademark verbal constructions, his restrained approach to on-screen gunplay, and the care that he takes in shaping the relationships between the principals.

A self-described liberal hawk,Criticisms of Charles Krauthammer, tnr.com; accessed February 16, 2015. he has written pieces critical of left-wing figures such as Naomi Klein and wrote a New Republic cover article condemning Delaware's tax haven policies. Chait was an initial supporter of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.

Chait occasionally writes about sports, particularly stories involving his alma mater, the University of Michigan, where he was a columnist for The Michigan Daily. He strongly criticized the editorial staff of The Detroit Free Press after a controversial article by Michael Rosenberg that alleged systematic infractions of NCAA rules by the Michigan football program under former head coach Rich Rodriguez.

On May 24, 2010, the University of Michigan responded to the NCAA Notice of Allegations, stating in part, \\"the University is satisfied that the initial media reports were greatly exaggerated if not flatly incorrect.\\" Chait then claimed Rosenberg's allegations that Rodriguez \\"operated a football sweatshop has been totally debunked.\\"Chait comments after the University of Michigan response to the NCAA Notice of Allegations\\", michigan.rivals.com; accessed February 16, 2015. On September 26, 2011, Chait, while admitting he had not read Gilad Atzmon's book The Wandering Who, in order to assess the context of a number of quotes, responded to John Mearsheimer's comment about Atzmon's book by citing passages which he regarded as characteristically anti-semitic. On January 27, 2015, Chait wrote an article for New York magazine on political correctness, which he labeled \\"a system of left-wing ideological repression\\" and cited examples from academia and social media. Chait's piece drew parallels between forms of political correctness popular in the 2010s with those popular in the 1990s. However, he also argued that the advent of social media had contributed to a form of political correctness that was more ubiquitous and less constrained to academia. In February 2016, Chait wrote a piece for New York magazine titled \\"Liberals Should Support a Trump Republican Nomination,\\" in which he predicted that a Trump presidency would develop similarly to the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger in California (who, like Trump, was a celebrity who became a Republican politician without any public service experience). In 2019, The Outline selected this piece as one of the \\"worst takes of the 2010s\\", opining that \\"Chait's immensely confident take [...] is a humiliating crystallization of the wrongheaded thinking that propelled [Trump] to the White House.\\" Chait has written extensively in support of charter schools. On January 14, 2019, he accused Senator Elizabeth Warren of selling out to \\"powerful interests\\" for her opposition to an initiative which would have expanded the number of charter schools in Massachusetts. Chait has been criticized for often failing to disclose his wife's career in charter school advocacy. Chait was highly critical of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, arguing that Sanders would have been \\"an extremely, perhaps uniquely, risky nominee\\" whose \\"vulnerabilities [were] enormous and untested.\\" Chait also negatively compared Sanders to 1964 Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater.

Biography After dropping out of high school, Lederer enlisted in the navy in 1930. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1936. His first appointment was as the junior officer of the USS Tutuila, a river gunboat on the Yangtze River. With the advent of World War II, he was a line officer in Asia and then in the Atlantic Theater, serving as a ship's navigation officer in the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily. He was eventually posted to the Pentagon as a public information officer, and then served the same duty as special assistant to CINCPAC, Hawaii. His best selling work, 1958's The Ugly American, was one of two novels he co-wrote with Eugene Burdick, a former navy lieutenant commander and Oxford don. Disillusioned with America's diplomatic efforts in Southeast Asia, Lederer and Burdick sought to demonstrate that American officials and civilians could make a substantial difference in Southeast Asian politics if they were willing to learn local languages, follow local customs, and use regional military tactics. They were concerned that if American policy makers continued to ignore the logic behind these lessons, Southeast Asia would fall under Soviet or Chinese influence. In the book's epilogue, they argue for the creation of \\"a small force of well- trained, well-chosen, hard-working and dedicated professionals\\" fluent in the local language, which presaged the Peace Corps, which John F. Kennedy proposed in 1960. In A Nation of Sheep, Lederer identified intelligence failures in Asia.

In Government by Misinformation, he investigates the sources that he believes lead to American foreign policy: * Trusted local officials. * Local (foreign) newspapers, magazines, books, radio broadcasts, etc. * Paid local informers. * Personal observations by U.S. officials. * American journalists. Other works were intended to be light- hearted and humorous fantasies. His early works, All the Ships at Sea and Ensign O'Toole and Me are both. A children's book, Timothy's Song, with illustrations by Edward Ardizzone, appeared in 1965. Lederer rose to the rank of Navy Captain. In Our Own Worst Enemy, Lederer relates that as a young Navy Lieutenant, Junior Grade in 1940, he had a chance meeting with a Jesuit priest, Father Pierre Cogny, and his Vietnamese assistant, \\"Mr. Nguyen,\\" while he was waiting out a Japanese bombing raid in China. Father Pierre asked Lederer if he had a copy of the United States Declaration of Independence on his gunboat, and Lederer said that he did and provided them with a copy. \\"Mr. Nguyen\\" was eager to deliver the document to \\"Tong Van So,\\" who later became known as Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Communist revolutionary and statesman who served as prime minister (1946‚Äì1955) and president (1945‚Äì1969) of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). The 1945 Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, written by Ho Chi Minh, begins by quoting from the American document. This book describes how the United States supported a corrupt President Ngo Diem in South Vietnam, ignored massive black market selling of stolen US military supplies, food, and foreign aid and refused to stand up to corrupt local officials who stole donated food and supplies, took kickbacks and bullied their own population, as Americans continued saying, \\"It's their country, and we Americans are only guests here.\\" Lederer died December 5, 2009, of respiratory failure at the age of 97.

An industrial area with traditions reaching back to the early 19th century, it underwent a transformation into an office (commercial) and residential district. Several museums are located in Wola, notably the Warsaw Uprising Museum. History First mentioned in the 14th century, it became the site of the elections, from 1573 to 1764, of Polish kings by the szlachta (nobility) of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth.

During the Warsaw Uprising (August‚ÄìOctober 1944), fierce battles raged in Wola.

Written by Leigh Brackett and loosely based on the novel The Stars in Their Courses by Harry Brown, the film is about a gunfighter who comes to the aid of an old friend‚Äîa drunken sheriff struggling to defend a rancher and his family against another rancher trying to steal their water. The gunfighter and drunken sheriff are helped by an aging Indian fighter and a young gambler. The supporting cast features James Caan as the young gambler, Charlene Holt, Ed Asner, Paul Fix, Arthur Hunnicutt, Michele Carey, and Christopher George. El Dorado was filmed on location in Tucson, Arizona, and Kanab, Utah, and was shot in Technicolor. The paintings in the credits are by artist Olaf Wieghorst, who makes a brief appearance as Swede Larsen in the film. The musical score was composed by Nelson Riddle. Paramount Pictures delayed the release of the film in the United States to avoid competing against another Paramount film, Nevada Smith with Steve McQueen. The film was first released in Japan on December 17, 1966, and was finally released in the United States on June 7, 1967. The film received critical praise and was successful at the box office, generating North American rentals of $5,950,000 on box-office receipts of $12 million.McCarthy, p. 625. El Dorado is the second of three films directed by Hawks about a sheriff defending his office against belligerent outlaw elements in the town, after Rio Bravo (1959) and before Rio Lobo (1970), both also starring Wayne in approximately the same role. The plotlines of all three films are almost similar enough to qualify El Dorado and Rio Lobo as remakes. Dean Martin had portrayed the drunken deputy in Rio Bravo, preceding Mitchum in the part as a drunken sheriff, while Walter Brennan played the wild old man role later rendered by Arthur Hunnicutt, and Ricky Nelson appeared as a gunslinging newcomer similar to Caan in El Dorado. Members of the Western Writers of America chose the film's theme as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Plot Sheriff J.P. Harrah rides into the town of El Dorado to talk to his old friend, gun-for-hire Cole Thornton, who has just arrived in response to a mysterious job offer from wealthy landowner Bart Jason. Harrah reveals to Thornton that Jason is actually trying to muscle the honest MacDonald Family off their land. Thornton agrees to turn down the job and rides out to Jason's ranch to tell him so. Kevin MacDonald and his family hear about Thornton's arrival, and fear the worst. The youngest son, Luke, is made sentry, but falls asleep behind a rock. As Thornton returns from his confrontation with Jason, Luke is startled awake and fires. Thornton reflexively fires back and wounds Luke in the stomach. Luke commits suicide before Thornton can stop him, believing his wound fatal. Feeling guilty, Thornton brings the body to the farmhouse and tells Kevin what happened. The only daughter of the MacDonald clan, Joey, rides off before she can hear the truth, and shoots Thornton on his way back to town. Thornton spares Joey's life, but the bullet has lodged against his spine. The local doctor doesn't have the skill to remove it, so Thornton heals and departs, despite the protests of local saloon owner Maudie, who has feelings for him. Doc Miller warns Thornton a skilled surgeon should remove the bullet soon. As time goes on, Thornton suffers bouts of temporary paralysis in his right side. Six months later, Thornton is in a saloon out of town, having avoided El Dorado out of guilt, when he witnesses a young man, \\"Mississippi\\" Traherne, confronting famed gunslinger Nelse McLeod, because McLeod's right hand man Charlie killed his foster father. Thornton has to step in to save the naive youngster, who has literally brought a knife to a gunfight. McLeod is impressed and offers Thornton a job, revealing that he's accepted Jason's job offer. He also says that Harrah is no longer a threat. Thornton refuses, and he and Mississippi return to El Dorado ahead of McLeod to find out the truth. In El Dorado, Maudie reveals that Harrah has become a helpless drunk 2 months prior after a girl ran out on him, and Harrah's deputy Bull confirms this. After a fist fight with the drunken Harrah, Thornton agrees to use one of Mississippi's sobering concoctions to bring Harrah round, with violently effective results. Harrah, ashamed of the laughingstock he's become, agrees to stay sober. After three men shoot one of the MacDonald's, Thornton, Bull, Mississippi and Harrah hunt the men into an old church and gun them down. One man escapes, leading them straight to Jason, whom Harrah arrests and holds for trial. Mississippi stops Joey from killing Jason on the walk back to the jail, and the two begin a relationship. Bull officially deputizes Mississippi and Thornton. They patrol the town to keep the peace, stopping an attempted attack by McLeod's gang on the jail in which Harrah is crippled by a bullet to the leg. Maudie brings them some supplies while they are holed up in the jail, and McLeod's men start harassing her and her patrons. Thornton and Mississippi go to rescue them, but Thornton suffers an attack of paralysis and is captured by McLeod. Harrah agrees to trade Jason for Thornton and leave town, despite Thornton's protests. Jason and McLeod's men kidnap Saul MacDonald and demand that Kevin turn over his water rights for the return of his son. Rightly suspecting Jason will kill both Saul and Kevin once he has the water rights, Thornton, unable to walk, rides a wagon up to the front door of Jason's Saloon while Harrah, Bull, and Mississippi sneak in the back. Bull distracts the men with a bugle call and Thornton opens fire, killing McLeod and several others while the rest ambush from behind and free Saul MacDonald. Joey takes out Jason personally, saving Thornton from being shot in the back, and telling him she felt she owed him after her previous mistake. Doc Miller's new assistant, Dr. Donovan, agrees to operate on Thornton if he stays in town, and Thornton implies he may give up wandering to stay with Maudie.

It wasn't tragic, but it was one of those things where Wayne died at the end.\\" However she says the closer they got to production \\"the more we got into doing Rio Bravo over again the sicker I got, because I hate doing things over again. And I kept saying to Howard I did that, and he'd say it was okay, we could do it over again.\\" \\"Tangent Online Presents: An Interview with Leigh Brackett & Edmond Hamilton, Interviewers: Dave Truesdale and Paul McGuire III Location: Minneapolis, Minnesota Event & Date: Minicon 11, April 16-18, 1976 accessed 28 May 2014 Mitchum later said, \\"When Howard called me, I said, 'What's the story?' and he said, 'No story, just characters' and that's the way it was. Did one scene, put it away, did another, put it away.\\" Shot at Old Tucson Studios just west of Tucson, Arizona, as well as in and around Kanab, Utah, from October 1965 to January 1966, the film was Wayne's 138th picture and was actually filmed before The War Wagon, but its release was delayed so that Paramount's Nevada Smith with Steve McQueen would not have to compete with a John Wayne film at the box office. El Dorado finally reached the theatres in June 1967, a month after The War Wagon had opened.Davis, 1998, pp. 274‚Äì275. Film footage from El Dorado was later incorporated into the opening montage of Wayne's final film, The Shootist, to illustrate the backstory of Wayne's character. Director Don Siegel used no scenes from any film shot before 1948 in The Shootists frontispiece even though Wayne's career as a leading man began in 1930 with Raoul Walsh's lavish widescreen epic The Big Trail and had continued throughout the following two decades. As he often did in action movies, especially Westerns, John Wayne wore his Red River D belt buckle Hawks had given him when shooting wrapped on Red River in El Dorado. It can be seen in the opening scene where Robert Mitchum confronts Wayne in the washroom. Wayne's horse was a six-year-old Appaloosa stallion named Zip, from Spalding, Idaho. Cinematographer Harold Rosson had retired in 1958, but Hawks persuaded him to come back to work. In a 1970 interview with Leonard Maltin, Rosson said, \\"I was out of my mind I'd ever quit,\\" but went back into retirement‚Äîfor good‚Äîafterwards, citing his age as a reason (75 at the time of the interview). Caan was somehow unable to pronounce the word \\"boldly\\" as he recited \\"Ride boldly ride\\" during the course of the film, leaving audience members unfamiliar with Poe's poem to wonder what or whom \\"bodie\\" was. In the film, Mississippi gives Sheriff Harrah a concoction meant to deter him from further drinking. The ingredients include (among others) Cayenne pepper, ipecac (an emetic), mustard, croton oil (which induces diarrhea), asafoetida (often misspelled acifedida) and gunpowder. The movie marked the only time Wayne and Mitchum worked together in a theatrical film unless one counts The Longest Day, an ensemble epic in which they share no scenes. Poem The poem repeated in the film and paraphrased in the theme song is \\"Eldorado\\", a ballad poem by Edgar Allan Poe.

As a Catholic convert, he has forfeited his right of succession. Lord Nicholas has voiced strong views on the issue of abortion, and actively promotes the protection of the unborn child. Early years Lord Nicholas Windsor was born on 25 July 1970 at King's College Hospital in Denmark Hill, London, to Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Katharine, Duchess of Kent. He has an older brother, the Earl of St Andrews, and a sister, Lady Helen Taylor. He was baptised on 11 September 1970 at Windsor Castle. His godparents included Charles, Prince of Wales and Donald Coggan, at the time Archbishop of York and later Archbishop of Canterbury. Windsor was educated at Westminster Under School and then Harrow School. He later attended Harris Manchester College, Oxford, where he studied theology. Religion In a private ceremony in 2001 he was received into the Catholic Church, and therefore forfeited his right of succession to the British throne. His mother had converted seven years earlier. Roman Catholics are barred from the succession by the Act of Settlement 1701. On 14 July 2011, he became an Honorary Vice-President of the Friends of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham, an Anglican Ordinariate within the Catholic Church. He has voiced strong views on the issue of abortion, which he has stated is, as a societal threat, \\"worse than al-Qaeda\\". Marriage and family Windsor met his future wife, Paola Doimi de Lupis Frankopan ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski, at a party in New York City in 1999 to mark the Millennium. He became engaged to her in July 2006. They married on 4 November 2006 in the Church of St Stephen of the Abyssinians in the Vatican following a civil ceremony on 19 October 2006 in a London register office and she became Lady Nicholas Windsor. He became the first member of the English royal family to be married there since the Reformation. As required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772, the Queen of the United Kingdom consented to the marriage. A House of Commons Early Day Motion welcomed \\"the first overt marriage within the rites of the Catholic Church of a member of the Royal Family since the reign of Queen Mary I, and the first marriage of a member of the Royal Family to take place within the Vatican City State\\". Lord and Lady Nicholas Windsor had their first child, a son, Albert Louis Philip Edward Windsor, on 22 September 2007 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London. Albert is the eighth grandchild for the Duke and Duchess of Kent. The child is the first Windsor to carry the name Albert since King George VI. An Early Day Motion in the House of Commons welcomed the baptism of Albert as the first royal child to be baptised a Catholic since 1688. Albert was baptised on 20 February 2007 in a Catholic ceremony held in the Queen's Chapel adjoining St James's Palace in London. Lady Nicholas gave birth to the couple's second child, Leopold Ernest Augustus Guelph Windsor, on 8 September 2009 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Leopold was baptised by Angelo Cardinal Comastri in St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican on 29 May 2010. A third son, Louis Arthur Nicholas Felix Windsor, was born 27 May 2014. Lord Nicholas and his sons are still in the line of succession to the Dukedom of Kent, the descent of which is not regulated by the Act of Settlement. He and his sons are 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th in line of succession to the Dukedom of Kent respectively. Charity In 2011, Windsor was appointed to the Pontifical Academy for Life. He is co- signatory of the San Jos√© Articles which promote the protection of the unborn child. In 2007, Windsor accepted the invitation to become Patron of Bromley Mind. The position is a public statement of his support for its work, and he makes a practical contribution from time to time by supporting special events and fundraising campaigns. Windsor has worked for the Refugee Council in London, the DePaul Trust for the homeless and in a school for autistic children. He was a Visiting Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Centre in Washington DC. He is a Trustee of the Catholic National Library UK and The Right to Life Charitable Trust, an educational body whose goal is the full protection of the unborn child. Windsor is the Royal Patron, along with his wife Paola of the Christian Heritage Centre at Stonyhurst. A Charitable endeavour to make the historic collections of Stonyhurst College and the story they tell more widely accessible particularly to young people in the surrounding areas. He wrote for the American journal First Things on the subject of abortion, an article which was entered into the United States Congressional Record by Congressman Chris Smith. He has written in the Telegraph and The Catholic Herald on pro-life issues.

An ice field covers its eastern side. The island takes its name from Thomas Edge (died 1624), an English merchant and whaler. It is seldom visited today.Svalbard Images, 2008 History The history of Edge√∏ya's discovery has been a matter of dispute. Thomas Edge, writing in 1622, claimed the island was discovered by one of his ships in 1616. However, Joris Carolus, in a map published in 1614 and allegedly based on discoveries made by him the same year, shows what appears to be Edge√∏ya's south coast. Carolus showed the coastline split into two parts: \\"Onbekende Cust\\" (meaning \\"Unknown Coast\\" in Dutch) in the west, and \\"Morfyn\\" in the east. Islands are shown offshore of Morfyn. Martin Conway argued in 1901 that Carolus' chart indicated he discovered Edge√∏ya,Martin Conway, 1901 but, as Wielder points out, Conway was ignorant of a map (engraved in 1612) by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius, which illustrated a coastline to the east of Spitsbergen. The coastline, indented, with islands offshore, was labelled \\"Gerrits Eylant\\". Wielder believed this to be the first record of Edge√∏ya's south coast. Schilder, an expert on Dutch cartography, said Carolus merely copied both coastlines from earlier charts, while he believed that Plancius had copied some names from a chart by Mouris Willemsz, unknown to Wielder, that was published in 1608 or earlier by Cornelis Claeszoon (British Library, London). Willemsz's chart, which Schilder says shows Edge√∏ya labeled as \\"Groen Landt\\", doesn't show Edge√∏ya at all, but only shows a single coastline (not two) that is supposed to represent Spitsbergen. In fact, what appears to be Bj√∏rn√∏ya is shown to the southeast of Spitsbergen. Plancius had thus only created a duplicate Spitsbergen. Carolus, as well, made a duplicate Spitsbergen, as his Morfyn has an uncanny resemblance to Willemsz's Groen Landt. This would indicate that the island would not have been discovered until 1616, as claimed by Edge. A 1617 letter written between the English whalers proves that Europeans had discovered the island at least at that late of date, or earlier, as Edge claims. Four Russian sailors were marooned on Edge√∏ya, or a small island off the coast of Edge√∏ya, from 1743 until September 1749. Three survived to tell an epic tale of survival. Author David Roberts wrote a book about his research on this story, Four Against The Arctic.Four Against the Arctic: Shipwrecked for Six Years at the Top of the World. (2003). Simon & Schuster. He concluded, although not definitively, that the men were probably on a small island to the southeast of Edge√∏ya called Halvm√•ne√∏ya, or Half Moon Island. While no major settlement grew upon Edge√∏ya, whaling and walrus hunting were extensive industries in the area. Remains of these can be found offshore of Edge√∏ya, on B√∂lsche√∏ya in the Thousand Islands group. Geography and ecology Location of Edge√∏ya in Svalbard Kapp Lee and the Storfjorden Edge√∏ya is located at geographical co-ordinates . To the west lies Storfjorden, which separates Edge√∏ya from Spitsbergen. To the north, the sound known as Freemansundet lies between Edge√∏ya and Barents√∏ya. In the northeast, Olgastretet separates Edge√∏ya from Kong Karls Land. Minor island groups lay to the east (Ryke Yse√∏yane) and to the south (Thousand Islands).

The island's northernmost point is Kapp Heuglin, a cape named in August 1870 for the German explorer Theodor von Heuglin (1824‚Äì76), during the Heuglin-Zeil expedition. Geologically, the island resembles central Spitsbergen, with Mesozoic rocks (specifically, Triassic shales with subordinate sandstones, with occasional diabase intrusions, and, in the southwest, strata from the Jurassic), the effects of glacial erosion, and appearance of polar ice caps. On the eastern side of the island is the large glacier of Edge√∏yj√∏kulen. Along with Barents√∏ya and some of the neighbouring islands, Edge√∏ya forms part of South East Svalbard Nature Reserve, established by the Norwegian government in 1973. There is a significant reindeer population, and the island is an important site for polar bear reproduction; moreover, the polar bear population in this Barents Sea area is a unique deme (unique genetic population).C. Michael Hogan, 2008 In popular culture Edge√∏ya is the setting for the novel The Solitude of Thomas Cave (2007), by Georgina Harding, in which the title character, on a wager, successfully over-winters on the island in 1616‚Äì17. It is also the setting for the book Four Against the Artic by David Roberts, which tells the true story of 4 Pomory sailors who spent 6 years on the island after their ship was destroyed.

He was himself a railroad executive, leading the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (DRGW), Western Pacific Railroad (WP), and Manhattan Railway. Early life Gould was born on February 6, 1864, the eldest son of Jay Gould (1836‚Äì1892) and Helen Day Miller (1838‚Äì1889). His father was a leading American railroad developer and speculator who has been referred to as one of the ruthless robber barons of the Gilded Age, whose success at business made him one of the richest men of his era. Railroad management Upon his father's death George inherited the Gould fortune and his father's railroad holdings, including the DRGW and the Missouri Pacific Railroad. While in charge of the DRGW at the turn of the 20th century, he sent surveyors and engineers through California's Feather River canyon to stake out a route for the railroad to reach San Francisco, California. Through legal wranglings led by E. H. Harriman, who at the time led both the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific Railroads, Gould was forced to set up third-party companies to manage the surveying and construction to disguise his role. The route that Gould's engineers built became the WP mainline. In later years, the DRGW and WP would work together on trains that were passed off to each other in Salt Lake City, Utah, including the prestigious passenger train, the California Zephyr. Personal life He married Edith Mary Kingdon (1864‚Äì1921), a stage actress, and had the following children: * Kingdon Gould, Sr. (1887‚Äì1945) who married Annunziata Camilla Maria Lucci (1890‚Äì1961). * Jay Gould II (1888‚Äì1935) who was a tennis player and who married Anne Douglass Graham, a descendant of Hawaiian royalty. * Marjorie Gwynne Gould (1891‚Äì1955) who married Anthony Joseph Drexel III, grandson of Anthony Joseph Drexel through Anthony Joseph Drexel, Jr. * Helen Vivien Gould (1893‚Äì1931) who married John Graham Hope DeLaPoer Horsley Beresford, 5th Baron Decies (1866‚Äì1945). * George Jay Gould II (1896-1963) who married Laura Carter. * Edith Catherine Gould (1901‚Äì1937) who married Carroll Livingston Wainwright I (1899‚Äì1967; their son was Stuyvesant Wainwright) and after a divorce married Sir Hector Murray MacNeal. * Gloria Gould (1906‚Äì1943) who married Henry A.

Ty Warner (born September 3, 1944) is an American billionaire toy manufacturer, businessman, and former actor. He is the CEO, sole owner and founder of Ty Inc. which manufactures and distributes stuffed toys, including Beanie Babies and other lines. He is also a property owner, notably Four Seasons Hotel New York, which he bought with profits earned selling Beanie Babies during a fad in the late 1990s. Biography=Early life and career Warner was born on September 3, 1944, in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in suburban La Grange, in a Prairie-style house designed in the early 1890s by Frank Lloyd Wright, now known as the Peter Goan House. His father was Harold \\"Hal\\" Warner, a jeweler and toy salesman. His mother was Georgia Warner, a pianist. He has a much younger sister, Joyce. He was named after baseball player Ty Cobb. Warner's relationships with both parents were strained. Georgia was noted for erratic and sometimes abusive or dangerous behavior and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in the 1970s.Bissonette (2015), Chapters 1 and 2 When Ty was an adult and his parents divorced, he was said to have attempted to seduce several of his father's girlfriends out of jealousy or competitiveness. At the age of 14, Warner went to Lyons Township High School (south campus) in Western Springs, Illinois. He then went to St. John's Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin. Warner attended Kalamazoo College in Michigan but dropped out after a year. 1980-1993 Warner moved to Los Angeles to start a career in acting. He had little success as an actor and returned to Chicago after five years. There he began working for plush toy maker Dakin as a salesman, the same company where his father worked. He was described by a former co-worker as possessing \\"uncanny\\" instincts as a salesman to retail shops, knowing which items would be most successful. In 1980 he was fired by Dakin, reportedly for selling his own products to established customers in competition with the company's line. After spending a three-year sabbatical in Italy, Warner returned to Chicago. In 1986, he mortgaged his home and invested his life savings and a bequest from his father into founding Ty Inc. Warner started out selling stuffed toy cats (inspired by some plush he had seen in Italy). 1993-2004 In 1993 Ty Inc. launched Beanie Babies, a series of small plush toys shaped like various animals. He focused on selling the $5 or $10 Beanie Babies to small independent toy stores rather than large retailers like Toys R Us, Target or WalMart, preferring to have multiple small clients rather than a handful of large ones.Bissonette (2015) He drove up demand by artificially restricting items shipped to each store below requested orders, and by creating deliberate shortages by discontinuing old items and introducing new ones in an essentially arbitrary manner rather than the more common toy industry pattern of releasing new items once or twice a year. A secondary market developed when collectors began reselling the toys at greatly inflated prices, and various books, magazines and accessories like carrying cases devoted to Beanie Babies appeared. At the peak of the Beanie craze circa 1999, the privately owned Ty Inc. is believed to have earned over $700 million in profits in a year. The Beanie Babies phenomenon, coupled with the rise of the Internet, is cited as elevating Warner to billionaire status with a net worth of over $3.5 billion. =Pioneering Internet sales= Lina Trivedi was a college student when she worked at Ty Inc. and she approached Warner to talk about a new development on college campuses, the Internet. She indicated that it was primarily a research tool, however college students were starting to make personal websites and she thought creating a website for Beanie Babies could present an unprecedented opportunity to engage the market in a unique way. She brought to Ty's office a 14.4k modem and demonstrated how the Internet works. Warner was intrigued and gave Trivedi free license to create a site. By the time the first iteration of the Ty website was published in late 1995, only 1.4% of Americans were using the Internet. The population of people using the Internet grew exponentially in the following years, along with the popularity of Beanie Babies. 2004-present In 2007, Ty Inc. went head to head with MGA Entertainment, the makers of the Bratz dolls, with the release of the Ty Girlz dolls and virtual world. He also has significant investments in hotels, property and golf courses. Ty Warner Hotels and Resorts include the Four Seasons Hotel in New York City, the Sandpiper golf course, the Four Seasons Resort and San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California, the Kona Village resort in Hawaii (purchased in July 2004), the Montecito Country Club and the Las Ventanas al Paraiso Resort in Los Cabos, Mexico (acquired in September 2004). In 2005, Warner also bought the beachfront Miramar resort and Rancho San Marcos golf course but sold the Miramar hotel in 2007 to Caruso Affiliated. Philanthropy He has donated in excess of $6 million to the Andre Agassi Foundation for underprivileged children in Las Vegas and $3 million for the creation of Ty Warner Park in Westmont, Illinois. He also donated $1.5 million for the creation of the Ty Warner Sea Center in Santa Barbara, California and donated one million Beanie Babies for children in Iraq. Warner also donated more than $300 million worth of soft toys for a Red Cross blood drive. Additionally, Warner has designed a number of Beanie Babies with the intention of donating all of the profits to charity. Ty Inc.'s charity releases have raised millions for a variety of charities, including the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the American Red Cross, and the Princess Diana Memorial Fund. In 2006, he received the Children's Champion Award from Children's Hunger Fund for his philanthropic efforts‚ÄîTy Inc. donated 1 million Beanie Babies to Children‚Äôs Hunger Fund relief efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2012, Warner stopped a woman and asked for directions in Santa Barbara, California. The woman was trying to raise money for a stem-cell procedure she needed to save her life. After learning of her condition, he gave her $20,000 for the procedure. Tax evasion In 2014, Warner was sentenced to two years of probation plus community service for tax evasion. Since 1996, he had maintained a secret offshore account in Switzerland with UBS, which according to the prosecution concealed at one time $107 million. Later, Warner used Zurcher Kantonalbank to maintain his offshore account. His philanthropic activities were considered when sentencing him and he paid a $53 million fine. Warner had tried to take advantage of the IRS tax amnesty that was offered in the wake of the UBS 2008‚Äì10 tax scandal, but the government refused to accept him. His lawyers, including former IRS Deputy Commissioner Mark M. Matthews, successfully used the \\"Olenicoff Defense\\" to convince the judge that Warner did not deserve the year-and-one-day prison sentence recommended by prosecutors. The defense was based on the government's treatment of Igor Olenicoff, a California real estate tycoon. The lawyers cited Olenicoff for getting off without a jail sentence when he was sentenced for tax evasion via offshore accounts. Warner's pre-sentencing report that called for a jail sentence said his offshore account was the biggest ever found. In fact, the lawyers pointed out, Olenicoff had $240 million stashed offshore. The Olenicoff defense worked. On January 14, 2014, District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras sentenced Warner to two years' probation and 500 hours of community service. The judge rejected the prosecution's recommendation for jail time of one year and one day, to serve as a deterrent to other tax cheats. Olenicoff, who also got two years' probation and community service, pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return‚Äîa felony. Warner pleaded guilty to the more serious charge of tax evasion. Personal life Two of Warner's long-term girlfriends (Patricia Roche and Faith McGowan) were closely involved in the operations of Ty, Inc. during the development and success of Beanie Babies. However, he never married and has no children.

He was born in what is now known as Cowan Osborne Hollow, named for his father, in Copper Creek, Virginia. He was regionally famous from the time he was about 15 until his death at age 101 in 1992. Charlie had a unique style of playing the fiddle with his left hand, on a right-handed fiddle. He and his brother, Emmett Osborne, played on WOPI radio station in Bristol, Tennessee, from the early 1920s until the early 1930s. They were contemporaries of country music founders Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family, and occasionally gave advice to Tennessee Ernie Ford on his music.  Personal life  Uncle Charlie was blinded in his left eye at age 21 when he was shot in the head with a pistol that had been stolen from him. Beginning in the 1930s, he cut back his music and farmed a large farm near the Osborne Family Homeplace in Copper Creek, Virginia. In the mid-1970s, after the death of his wife, Clara, Charlie began to focus more on his music.  Career  In 1985, in conjunction with East Tennessee State University, Appalshop's June Appal Recordings recorded Uncle Charlie's first album, \\"Relics And Treasures\\". The album contained over a dozen traditional mountain songs, including \\"Ida Red\\", \\"Brown's Dream\\", and \\"Old Joe Clark\\". Uncle Charlie recorded two more albums with the label; his final was 1991's \\"One Hundred Years Farther On\\", which included the powerful and mournful mountain gospel song \\"Farther On,\\" which Uncle Charlie called \\"As We Travel Through The Desert\\". Also featured on the recordings were his son, Johnny C. Osborne, on clawhammer banjo, and Tommy Bledsoe, on guitar and banjo. These recordings were reissued by June Appal Recordings as \\"Uncle Charlie Osborne: The June Appal Recordings.\\" In the 1980s, Governor Chuck Robb came to his home and presented him with an award recognizing his contributions to Virginia life and culture. Also, in the mid eighties, he and his brother Emmett began playing heavily with their half- brother, George Osborne, a former country & western singer. Their weekly or semi-weekly jam sessions became the stuff of legends. Uncle Charlie played numerous shows at the Carter Family Fold in Scott County, Virginia, a theatre showcasing traditional music which was run by Janette Carter, one of the daughters of the original Carter Family. On one occasion, Johnny Cash was Uncle Charlie's \\"opening act\\". He was a regular performer at Mountain Empire Community College's annual Home Craft Days festivals from 1985 until his death. Other performances included the Brandywine Festival, Appalshop's Seedtime on the Cumberland festival and a campaign rally for Jesse Jackson in Hazard, KY.  Death  Uncle Charlie walked three miles every day from his house in rural Tumbez, Virginia, about two miles from Lick Skillet, Virginia, and three miles from Hansonville, Virginia, until just days before his death. Uncle Charlie Osborne died on May 27, 1992 after a brief illness.

W. Harper brand of premium bourbon whiskey (a historically important brand currently owned by Diageo).Whisk(e)y brands page at Diageo web site. The success of his distillery and distribution business helped to consolidate the Louisville area as a major center of Kentucky bourbon distilling. Bernheim was also a philanthropist, establishing the Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest in Bullitt County. Early years Isaac Bernheim was born in Schmieheim, now part of Kippenheim in Germany and emigrated to the United States in 1867 with $4 in his pocket. He originally planned to work in New York City. \\"The story of the Bernheim family: A book written in 1910 by Isaac Wolfe Bernheim presenting a history of the Bernheim family. Includes stories and portraits of various family members.\\" However, the company where he wanted to work went bankrupt, and he was forced to follow a different line of work. He became a traveling salesman or \\"peddler\\" traveling throughout Pennsylvania on horseback selling household items to housewives and made a respectable living. However, he was forced to stop peddling when his horse died. Distilling business Following the death of his horse, Bernheim moved to Paducah, Kentucky, where he worked as a bookkeeper for a wholesale liquor company, Loeb, Bloom, & Co. He was able to save enough money to bring his brother Bernard to America. He quickly moved on, however, and with the help of his brother Bernard Bernheim and their friend Elbridge Palmer as a silent partner, he was able to open up his own liquor sales firm called Bernheim Brothers in 1872. In 1875, Palmer's interest in the business was bought out and Isaac's brother-in-law Nathan Uri (the brother of Isaac's wife Amanda) became a partner in the business, and the company was renamed as Bernheim Brothers & Uri. Because of their business's proximity to large waterways, the company grew rapidly. Bernheim Brothers & Uri moved its operations from Paducah to Louisville (on Main Street between 1st and 2nd) in 1888, and Uri left the business in 1889. The company then continued under its prior firm name of Bernheim Brothers and continued to expand. Bernheim Brothers bought the Pleasure Ridge Park Distillery in Louisville and it began operating as the Bernheim Distillery. In March 1896, the distillery's bonded warehouse at Pleasure Ridge Park, which it shared jointly with another whiskey business, was destroyed by fire.Veach, Michael R., The Pleasure Ridge Park Distillery, Filson Historical Society, July 5, 2011. The loss of the property itself was covered by insurance, but the cost of the unpaid whisky tax on the lost product proved difficult to settle for the business ‚Äì the matter was not settled until near the end of 1897. The courts eventually ruled that the tax was not due since the whiskey had been destroyed by the fire before it was sold. The company's new distillery plant (on the north side of Main Street, near 2nd) began operating in April 1897. The company began the production of an elite whiskey brand it called \\"I. W. Harper\\". (The \\"I. W.\\" in the name may have been an abbreviation for \\"Isaac Wolfe\\", with a different surname chosen for marketability.) During the Prohibition era in the U.S. (1920‚Äì1933), Bernheim Brothers was one of only ten distilleries allowed to continue to make bourbon, as they had received a license to produce it for medicinal purposes. A few years after Prohibition ended, Bernheim sold the business to the Schenley Distilling Corporation (in 1937). Community activity Isaac Bernheim became a notable philanthropist in Louisville. He established the Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest on in Bullitt County, south of Louisville and from Shepherdsville in 1929. He purchased the land in 1928 at $1 an acre ($247/km¬≤) ‚Äì the low price being because most of it had been stripped for mining iron ore. The Frederick Law Olmsted landscape architecture firm started work on designing the park in 1931 and it opened in 1950. Bernheim Forest was given to the people of Kentucky in trust and it is the largest privately owned natural area in the state. Bernheim, and his first wife, Amanda are buried at the Bernheim Forest. After Amanda died, Bernheim married her sister, Emma Uri Levy. They lived in Denver, Colorado. The memorial \\"Let there Be Light\\" by George Bernard Grey sits over their final resting place. Bernheim's daughter and son-in-law were buried in the forest as well as several other family members. Bernheim was a prominent member of the Jewish community, and was active in the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the American Jewish Committee. He donated to establish the first library at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. In Louisville, he funded the first home for the Young Men's Hebrew Association and funded an addition to the Jewish Hospital. Bernheim, an adherent of Reform Judaism, continues to have great-grandchildren who follow in his footsteps in the continuation of the Reform Movement and philanthropic activity. In 2007 in his honor, his granddaughter Amanda Roth Block donated to the Hebrew Union College in New York City to President Rabbi David Ellenson a lithograph, \\"Moses and the Burning Bush\\", which was inspired by her grandfather's dedication to the Reform movement. Bernheim's library at the Hebrew Union College was renovated to be the home of priceless documents and rare Torah scrolls. Bernheim also financed two statues installed in the statuary hall of the U.S. Capitol, making them the only two statues there to be privately purchased. In addition, he financed a statue of Abraham Lincoln outside the main branch of the Louisville Free Public Library and the statue of Thomas Jefferson outside the Jefferson County courthouse. Upon visiting his hometown of Schmieheim, Germany in the early 20th century, he discovered the village had no running water, and made a large contribution to improve the situation, enabling the town to install its first plumbing system. He also built a home for the elderly and a home for children.  The modern Bernheim distillery and brands  In 1992, a large distilling plant called the Bernheim Distillery was opened in Louisville (on West Breckinridge Street near Dixie Highway) by United Distillers, which was owned by Guinness. United owned the I. W. Harper brand at the time the distillery was opened, but it had cheapened the quality of the brand in the U.S. market, focusing instead on Asia and Europe (especially Japan, where the product became a top brand of bourbon). They then took the brand off the U.S. market entirely. United became Diageo in 1997 when Guinness merged with Grand Metropolitan, and Diageo continues to own the brand but no longer owns the distillery. The modern Bernheim distillery is not to be confused with the prior Bernheim distillery sites. The Bernheim distillery was purchased by Heaven Hill Distilleries in 1999, and it was substantially refurbished to become Heaven Hill's main distilling plant. Heaven Hill purchased the site after a 1996 fire destroyed its prior distilling plant in Bardstown. In March 2015, after the brand had been off the U.S. market for 20 years, Diageo announced that it was reintroducing the I. W. Harper brand in April 2015, using spirits distilled at the new Bernheim distillery, aged partly at the Stitzel-Weller warehouses, and bottled at Diageo's George Dickel plant in Tullahoma, Tennessee. However, as of February 2017, the brand is not listed as a current product on the Diageo web site and the brand's web site hasn't been updated since March 2015. The Bernheim Original wheat whiskey brand introduced by Heaven Hill in 2005 was also named after the Bernheim brothers, the distilling company they founded, and the modern distillery that bears their name.

It is the fourth step in the conventional transportation forecasting model, following trip generation, trip distribution, and mode choice. The zonal interchange analysis of trip distribution provides origin-destination trip tables. Mode choice analysis tells which travelers will use which mode. To determine facility needs and costs and benefits, we need to know the number of travelers on each route and link of the network (a route is simply a chain of links between an origin and destination). We need to undertake traffic (or trip) assignment. Suppose there is a network of highways and transit systems and a proposed addition. We first want to know the present pattern of traffic delay and then what would happen if the addition were made. General Approaches=Long- standing techniques The problem of estimating how many users are on each route is long standing. Planners started looking hard at it as freeways and expressways began to be developed. The freeway offered a superior level of service over the local street system, and diverted traffic from the local system. At first, diversion was the technique. Ratios of travel time were used, tempered by considerations of costs, comfort, and level of service. The Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) researchers developed diversion curves for freeways versus local streets. There was much work in California also, for California had early experiences with freeway planning. In addition to work of a diversion sort, the CATS attacked some technical problems that arise when one works with complex networks. One result was the Bellman‚ÄìFord‚ÄìMoore algorithm for finding shortest paths on networks. The issue the diversion approach did not handle was the feedback from the quantity of traffic on links and routes. If a lot of vehicles try to use a facility, the facility becomes congested and travel time increases. Absent some way to consider feedback, early planning studies (actually, most in the period 1960-1975) ignored feedback. They used the Moore algorithm to determine shortest paths and assigned all traffic to shortest paths. That is called all or nothing assignment because either all of the traffic from i to j moves along a route or it does not. The all-or-nothing or shortest path assignment is not trivial from a technical-computational view. Each traffic zone is connected to n - 1 zones, so there are numerous paths to be considered. In addition, we are ultimately interested in traffic on links. A link may be a part of several paths, and traffic along paths has to be summed link by link. An argument can be made favoring the all-or-nothing approach. It goes this way: The planning study is to support investments so that a good level of service is available on all links. Using the travel times associated with the planned level of service, calculations indicate how traffic will flow once improvements are in place. Knowing the quantities of traffic on links, the capacity to be supplied to meet the desired level of service can be calculated. Heuristic procedures To take account of the effect of traffic loading on travel times and traffic equilibria, several heuristic calculation procedures were developed. One heuristic proceeds incrementally. The traffic to be assigned is divided into parts (usually 4). Assign the first part of the traffic. Compute new travel times and assign the next part of the traffic. The last step is repeated until all the traffic is assigned. The CATS used a variation on this; it assigned row by row in the O-D table. The heuristic included in the FHWA collection of computer programs proceeds another way. *0. Start by loading all traffic using an all or nothing procedure. *1. Compute the resulting travel times and reassign traffic. *2. Now, begin to reassign using weights. Compute the weighted travel times in the previous two loadings and use those for the next assignment. The latest iteration gets a weight of 0.25 and the previous gets a weight of 0.75. *3. Continue. These procedures seem to work \\"pretty well,\\" but they are not exact. Frank-Wolfe algorithm Dafermos (1968) applied the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (1956, Florian 1976), which can be used to deal with the traffic equilibrium problem. Suppose we are considering a highway network. For each link there is a function stating the relationship between resistance and volume of traffic. The Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) developed a link (arc) congestion (or volume- delay, or link performance) function, which we will term Sa(va) S_a \\\\left( {v_a } \\\\right) = t_a \\\\left( {1 + 0.15\\\\left( {\\\\frac } \\\\right)^4 } \\\\right) *ta = free flow travel time on link a per unit of time *va = volume of traffic on link a per unit of time (somewhat more accurately: flow attempting to use link a). *ca = capacity of link a per unit of time *Sa(va) is the average travel time for a vehicle on link a There are other congestion functions. The CATS has long used a function different from that used by the BPR, but there seems to be little difference between results when the CATS and BPR functions are compared. Equilibrium assignment To assign traffic to paths and links we have to have rules, and there are the well-known Wardrop equilibrium conditions. The essence of these is that travelers will strive to find the shortest (least resistance) path from origin to destination, and network equilibrium occurs when no traveler can decrease travel effort by shifting to a new path. These are termed user optimal conditions, for no user will gain from changing travel paths once the system is in equilibrium. The user optimum equilibrium can be found by solving the following nonlinear programming problem \\\\min \\\\sum_a {\\\\int_0^{v_a} {S_a \\\\left( x \\\\right)} } dx subject to: v_a = \\\\sum_i {\\\\sum_j {\\\\sum_r {\\\\alpha _{ij}^{ar} x_{ij}^r } } } \\\\sum_r {x_{ij}^r = T_{ij} } v_a \\\\geq 0,\\\\;x_{ij}^r \\\\geq 0 where x_{ij}^r is the number of vehicles on path r from origin i to destination j. So constraint (2) says that all travel must take place ‚Äìi = 1 ... n; j = 1 ... n \\\\alpha _{ij}^{ar} = 1 if link a is on path r from i to j ; zero otherwise. So constraint (1) sums traffic on each link. There is a constraint for each link on the network. Constraint (3) assures no negative traffic. Example An example from Eash, Janson, and Boyce (1979) will illustrate the solution to the nonlinear program problem. There are two links from node 1 to node 2, and there is a resistance function for each link (see Figure 1). Areas under the curves in Figure 2 correspond to the integration from 0 to a in equation 1, they sum to 220,674. Note that the function for link b is plotted in the reverse direction. S_a = 15\\\\left( {1 + 0.15\\\\left( {\\\\frac} \\\\right)^4 } \\\\right) S_b = 20\\\\left( {1 + 0.15\\\\left( {\\\\frac} \\\\right)^4 } \\\\right) v_a + v_b = 8000 Figure 1: Two Route Network Figure 1 - Two Route Network Figure 2: Graphical Solution to the Equilibrium Assignment Problem Figure 2 - Graphical Solution to the Equilibrium Assignment Problem Figure 3: Allocation of Vehicles not Satisfying the Equilibrium Condition Figure 3 - Allocation of Vehicles not Satisfying the Equilibrium Condition At equilibrium there are 2,152 vehicles on link a and 5847 on link b. Travel time is the same on each route: about 63. Figure 3 illustrates an allocation of vehicles that is not consistent with the equilibrium solution. The curves are unchanged. But with the new allocation of vehicles to routes the shaded area has to be included in the solution, so the Figure 3 solution is larger than the solution in Figure 2 by the area of the shaded area. Integrating travel choices The urban transportation planning model evolved as a set of steps to be followed, and models evolved for use in each step. Sometimes there were steps within steps, as was the case for the first statement of the Lowry model. In some cases, it has been noted that steps can be integrated. More generally, the steps abstract from decisions that may be made simultaneously, and it would be desirable to better replicate that in the analysis. Disaggregate demand models were first developed to treat the mode choice problem. That problem assumes that one has decided to take a trip, where that trip will go, and at what time the trip will be made. They have been used to treat the implied broader context. Typically, a nested model will be developed, say, starting with the probability of a trip being made, then examining the choice among places, and then mode choice. The time of travel is a bit harder to treat. Wilson's doubly constrained entropy model has been the point of departure for efforts at the aggregate level. That model contains the constraint t_{ij}c_{ij}=C where the c_{ij} are the link travel costs, t_{ij} refers to traffic on a link, and C is a resource constraint to be sized when fitting the model with data. Instead of using that form of the constraint, the monotonically increasing resistance function used in traffic assignment can be used. The result determines zone-to-zone movements and assigns traffic to networks, and that makes much sense from the way one would imagine the system works ‚Äì zone-to-zone traffic depends on the resistance occasioned by congestion. Alternatively, the link resistance function may be included in the objective function (and the total cost function eliminated from the constraints). A generalized disaggregate choice approach has evolved as has a generalized aggregate approach. The large question is that of the relations between them. When we use a macro model, we would like to know the disaggregate behavior it represents. If we are doing a micro analysis, we would like to know the aggregate implications of the analysis. Wilson derives a gravity-like model with weighted parameters that say something about the attractiveness of origins and destinations. Without too much math we can write probability of choice statements based on attractiveness, and these take a form similar to some varieties of disaggregate demand models. Integrating travel demand with route assignment It has long been recognized that travel demand is influenced by network supply. The example of a new bridge opening where none was before inducing additional traffic has been noted for centuries. Much research has gone into developing methods for allowing the forecasting system to directly account for this phenomenon. Evans (1974) published a doctoral dissertation on a mathematically rigorous combination of the gravity distribution model with the equilibrium assignment model. The earliest citation of this integration is the work of Irwin and Von Cube, as related by Florian et al. (1975), who comment on the work of Evans: \\"The work of Evans resembles somewhat the algorithms developed by Irwin and Von Cube ['Capacity Restraint in Multi-Travel Mode Assignment Programs' H.R.B. Bulletin 347 (1962)] for a transportation study of Toronto. Their work allows for feedback between congested assignment and trip distribution, although they apply sequential procedures. Starting from an initial solution of the distribution problem, the interzonal trips are assigned to the initial shortest routes. For successive iterations, new shortest routes are computed, and their lengths are used as access times for input the distribution model. The new interzonal flows are then assigned in some proportion to the routes already found. The procedure is stopped when the interzonal times for successive iteration are quasi-equal.\\" Florian et al. proposed a somewhat different method for solving the combined distribution assignment, applying directly the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Boyce et al. (1988) summarize the research on Network Equilibrium Problems, including the assignment with elastic demand. Discussion A three link problem can not be solved graphically, and most transportation network problems involve a large numbers of nodes and links. Eash et al., for instance, studied the road net on DuPage County where there were about 30,000 one-way links and 9,500 nodes. Because problems are large, an algorithm is needed to solve the assignment problem, and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (with various modern modifications since first published) is used. Start with an all or nothing assignment, and then follow the rule developed by Frank-Wolfe to iterate toward the minimum value of the objective function. (The algorithm applies successive feasible solutions to achieve convergence to the optimal solution. It uses an efficient search procedure to move the calculation rapidly toward the optimal solution.) Travel times correspond to the dual variables in this programming problem. It is interesting that the Frank-Wolfe algorithm was available in 1956. Its application was developed in 1968, and it took almost another two decades before the first equilibrium assignment algorithm was embedded in commonly used transportation planning software (Emme and Emme/2, developed by Florian and others in Montreal). We would not want to draw any general conclusion from the slow application observation, mainly because we can find counter examples about the pace and pattern of technique development. For example, the simplex method for the solution of linear programming problems was worked out and widely applied prior to the development of much of programming theory. The problem statement and algorithm have general applications across civil engineering -‚Äì hydraulics, structures, and construction. (See Hendrickson and Janson 1984).  Empirical Studies of Route Choice  Route assignment models are based at least to some extent on empirical studies of how people choose routes in a network. Such studies are generally focused on a particular mode, and make use of either stated preference or revealed preference models.  Bicycle  Cyclists have been found to prefer designated bike lanes and avoid steep hills. Public Transport Public transport has long been considered in the context of route assignment and many studies have been conducted on transit route choice. Among other factors, transit users attempt to minimize total travel time, time or distance walking, and number of transfers.

It covers an entire city block between Metcalfe and O'Connor, south of Queen, north of Albert Street. The first phase of the project was completed in 1991. The twenty-story building was unusual in Ottawa for its visual flair. The eastern side was marked by a large plaza modeled after the Roman Colosseum. The building opened in the middle of a deep recession and initially had trouble being filled. The 1990s boom solved this and work began on a second tower, which was completed in 2001. This second tower greatly increased the available office space.  Description  The two towers hold offices for a variety of companies, including Deloitte, Borden Ladner Gervais (BLG), CTV, Microsoft, Accenture, Norton Rose Fulbright, RBC Dominion Securities, TD Canada Trust, CPAC and Beer Canada. Atop of one tower is the TD logo and atop the other is the BLG logo. The World Exchange Plaza shopping mall is located in the base of the structure. It is home to a number of stores. It also featured a movie theatre, the only cinema complex in the downtown core. This theatre closed on December 29, 2013 when Landmark Cinemas was unable to renew the lease. The theatre was also run by Cineplex Odeon from its opening in 1991 until September 30, 2005 when the theatre was bought by Empire Theatres. Empire Theatres operated the theatre from September 30, 2005 until October 29, 2013. Empty since 2013, the developer has applied to remodel the space into usable office space.

Unusually for those legal systems which have originated or been influenced during rule by the United Kingdom, the name of the offence associates with Scots law rather than English law. Jurisdictions \\"Culpable homicide\\" offences are found in the following jurisdictions; the description of the local version of the offence is given where available: Canada In Canada, \\"culpable homicide\\" is not itself an offence. Rather, the term is used in the Criminal Code to classify all killings of persons as either culpable or not culpable homicide.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 222. There are three types of culpable homicide: murder, manslaughter and infanticide. Killings classified as not culpable are justifiable killings; thus the term is used to define the criminal intent or mens rea of a killing. Non-culpable homicide includes those committed in self- defence.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 34. India The offences include causing death whether by intention or not. * Under ¬ß299Section 299 - Indian Penal Code, 1860 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), \\"[...committer of] Culpable homicide\\" is defined as \\"Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable.\\" \\"Culpable homicide not amounting to murder\\" is punishable under section 304 of IPCSection 304 - Indian Penal Code, 1860 of the Indian Penal Code. It is a non bailable charge with imprisonment up to 10 years with or without fine. Pakistan The Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in earlier form included the offence of \\"culpable homicide\\" for acts of homicide resulting from the infliction of intentional harm upon a person: Amendments in recent years have replaced the specific phrase \\"culpable homicide\\" within those sections and introduced terms from Sharia law but it remains in ¬ß38 (Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences). The current equivalent sections are: Following sections of the PPC deal further with the offence in increased detail. Scotland Culpable homicide is committed where the accused has caused loss of life through wrongful conduct, but where there was no intention to kill or \\"wicked recklessness\\".Scottish Government - \\"Information for Bereaved Families and Friends Following Murder or Culpable Homicide\\" () It is an offence under common law and is roughly equivalent to the offence of manslaughter in English and Welsh law. the Proposed Culpable Homicide (Scotland) Bill was expected to be introduced to the Scottish Parliament as a Member's Bill. While the offence charged remains the same there can be a great variation between individual cases including whether or not the act was voluntary or involuntary: * Voluntary culpable homicide is homicide where the mens rea for murder is present but mitigating circumstances reduce the crime to culpable homicide. * Involuntary culpable homicide is homicide where the mens rea for murder is not present but either the independent mens rea for culpable homicide is present, or the circumstances in which death was caused make it culpable homicide. Involuntary culpable homicide may arise in the context of an unlawful act or a lawful act. The mens rea requirement is different in each case. Singapore \\"Culpable homicide\\" is: Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. =Examples= * Person A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Person Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. * A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it.

Rules=Beginning the game The player going first is determined by a roll of dice. The object The object of Tamerlane chess, as in modern chess, is to checkmate the opposing shah [king]. Unlike in modern chess, stalemating an opponent is also a win. Promotion Upon reaching the last rank on the board, a pawn is promoted to its corresponding piece. Thus, the pawn of giraffes becomes a giraffe, etc. Exceptions to this are the pawn of kings and pawn of pawns. A pawn of kings becomes a prince. It moves as a king. If both a prince and a king exist simultaneously on the board, one of the two must be captured [like a regular piece] before the other can be checked/checkmated or stalemated to win the game. (This idea of allowing multiple kings on each side through promotion was coincidentally also invented about a century earlier in Japan in the game of dai shogi.) When the pawn of pawns reaches the last rank, it stays there and cannot be . As soon as a situation develops where the opponent cannot escape losing a piece to a pawn, or where a pawn may attack two opposing units at the same time [forked], the player must move his/her pawn to that location. It moves to this location even if the square is occupied, either by an allied or opposing piece. The piece occupying the square is removed from the board. On the pawn's next move, it may capture any piece it is attacking. It then continues forward on the board as a pawn. Upon the second promotion of this pawn, it moves to the starting point of the pawn of king. Upon the third promotion it becomes an adventitious king, which has the moves of the king, with one special exception as described in the next section. If an adventitious king exists on the board simultaneously with a prince and/or a king, they must be captured like a regular piece until only one remains, which must then be checkmated or stalemated to win.John Gollon, Chess Variants, Ancient, Regional and Modern, pp. 76‚Äì77 The citadels The two extra squares that protrude from the left of the ninth rank and the right of the second rank are called citadels [husun, singular hisn]. If, at any time during the game a player can move his king into his opponent's citadel, he can declare the game a draw. This is advantageous for a losing player as being stalemated is considered a loss in Tamerlane chess. Alternatively, if a player has a prince or adventitious king on the board when his shah enters his opponent's citadel, his shah can trade places with either of those pieces, and the game continues. The prince or adventitious king can later move out of the citadel to make way for the king to enter again, but the exchange privilege may only be used once. The shah [king] ranks higher than the prince, which ranks higher than the adventitious king. Only the highest ranking of the three on the board can enter the opponent's citadel. The adventitious king has the special honor of being the only piece on the board that can enter his own citadel. Upon entering, it becomes immune, thus blocking the opponent from entering the citadel and declaring a draw.H.J.R. Murray, A History of Chess, 1913 Other Once during the game a player may exchange a checked king for another non-royal piece. A player may move into check if he holds multiple kings. There is no castling or en passant moves in Tamerlane chess. Baring the opponent's king is not considered a win in Tamerlane chess, as the bared king still has the chance to enter the opponent's citadel. There is no three-fold repetition or 50-move draw in Tamerlane chess.

When meat is used as an ingredient, a choice of roast pork, shrimp, chicken, beef, or lobster may be offered. In Chinese Indonesian cuisine, it is known as fu yung hai, sometimes spelled pu yung hai. The omelette is usually made from the mixture of vegetables such as carrots, bean sprouts, and cabbages, mixed with meats such as crab meat, shrimp, or minced chicken. The dish is served in sweet and sour sauce with peas. In Western countries, the dish usually appears as a well-folded omelette with the non-egg ingredients embedded in the egg mixture. In America, it may be covered in or served with sauce or gravy. Chinese chefs in the United States, at least as early as the 1930s, created a pancake filled with eggs, vegetables, and meat or seafood. In a U.S. regional variation, many American-Chinese restaurants in St. Louis, Missouri, serve what is called a St. Paul sandwich, which is an egg foo young patty served with mayonnaise, dill pickle, and sometimes lettuce and tomato between two slices of white bread. In the Netherlands, which has a local variation on the Chinese Indonesian cuisine, it is known as Foe yong hai, and is usually served with a sweet tomato sauce. Strictly, according to hai in the name, it should contain crab, but it is often served without this ingredient.  Comparison  The Vietnamese dish ch·∫£ tr·ª©ng h·∫•p is similar to egg foo young. In Japanese Chinese cuisine, the dish kani-tama („Åã„Å´Áéâ or ËüπÁéâ) is similar, using crab meat instead of ham or other meats. Egg foo yung or kani-tama on plain rice draped with thick savory sauce is called ‚Äò‚ÄôTenshin-han‚Äô‚Äô (Â§©Ê¥•È£Ø, ‚Äò‚ÄôTianjin rice‚Äô‚Äô), even though no such dish is known in the actual Chinese city of Tianjin. Certain incarnations of the Korean-Chinese dish jjajang bokkeumbap (ÏßúÏû• Î≥∂ÏùåÎ∞•) are similar; in essence the dish consists of jjajang (a dark brown-black bean and meat sauce) and fried rice, with an optional fried egg or egg-foo-young-like omelet atop the rice. In Malay cuisine, it is similar to telur bungkus, which literally means \\"wrapped egg\\" (the wrap usually contains chicken or beef, onions, mushrooms, vegetables, and gravy, wrapped inside the egg). In Chinese Thai cuisine, this dish is called Khai Chiao Yat Sai, which literally means \\"stuffed fried egg\\". The common recipe uses minced pork and shredded spring onion.

Jodo Shinshu Buddhists often referred to as the restorer of the sect ( in Japanese). He was also known as Shinsh≈ç-in (‰ø°Ë®ºÈô¢), and posthumously Et≈ç Daishi (ÊÖßÁÅØÂ§ßÂ∏´). During the conflict of the ≈ånin War and the subsequent warfare that spread throughout Japan, Rennyo was able to unite most of the disparate factions of the Jodo Shinshu sect under the Hongan-ji, reform existing liturgy and practices, and broaden support among different classes of society. Through Rennyo's efforts, Jodo Shinshu grew to become the largest, most influential Buddhist sect in Japan. Rennyo is venerated along with Shinran, and liturgical reforms he implemented are still in use today in Jodo Shinshu temples. Further, Rennyo's letters were compiled and are still recited in Jodo Shinshu liturgy. Rennyo maintained a complex relationship with the Ikk≈ç-ikki peasant revolts, which were frequently by Shinshu followers, restraining them at times while also teaching and attending to their religious needs.  Biography = Early life  Born as Hoteimaru (), later Kenju (), Rennyo was the son of the 7th abbot or monshu of the Hongan-ji Temple, Zonny≈ç (, 1396‚Äì1457). At the age of 18 his father had fathered a son out of wedlock with a servant whose name is unknown. Being that Zonnyo was of a much higher rank and stature in society, Rennyo's mother was sent away when he was only 6 years old. Several times throughout his life he attempted to find his birth mother with no result. Also, Rennyo frequently quarreled with his step mother, Nyoen (d. 1460). In turn, his step mother Nyoen attempted to have her own son Ogen (1433‚Äì1503) installed as the successor to the Hongan-ji. However, Rennyo's uncle, Nyojo (1402‚Äì1460), dismissed the idea and Rennyo ultimately succeeded as the 8th monshu.  Early Ministry  Following his installation as 8th head priest at Hongan-ji in 1457, Rennyo focused his efforts in proselytizing in ≈åmi Province, an area dominated by the Bukk≈ç-ji and Kinshoku-ji branches of Shinsh≈´. Due to timely support from the Katada congregation, Rennyo was able to expand the Honganji's presence. These congregations in Omi Province were frequently composed of artisan-class followers, who were able to provide crucial funds and protection. During his early ministry Rennyo would frequently distribute religious texts to congregations as well as inscriptions of the nenbutsu (recitation of AmitƒÅbha Buddha's name). These inscriptions frequently used the so-called \\"10-character nembutsu\\" or : Soon Rennyo's influence spread into Mikawa Province, an area traditionally dominated by the Senju-ji branch of Shinsh≈´. He did this by making many appearances in these areas and presenting groups with his own commentaries on Shinran's works. The monks of the Enryaku-ji (the head temple of the Tendai School located on Mt. Hiei) noticed Rennyo's successes in the provinces around Kyoto. In 1465, Mt. Hiei sent a band of s≈çhei (warrior monks) to the Hongan-ji and destroyed most of the temple complex. The attacks were justified by claims that the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ movement was heretical. The actual motivation for these attacks was likely financial. Mt. Hiei had significant interests in ≈åmi Province that included properties and businesses, and felt they needed to prevent J≈çdo Shinsh≈´'s growth before they felt the economic effects. However, due to the wealth of the congregations Rennyo had converted in the area, enough money was raised to bribe the Mt. Hiei warriors in exchange for peace. The contingency to this was that Hongan-ji must become a member of Mt. Hiei's temples, thus entering them into yearly dues they had to pay Mt. Hiei. Rennyo was very nervous during this period, for just when Hongan-ji was at the pinnacle of uniting the disbanded factions of Shinran, Mt. Hiei reduced the ≈åmi temple to rubble. In any case, the Hongan-ji was almost entirely destroyed before armed men from the Takada congregation were able to chase away the attackers. According to one account, Rennyo was able to fleet at the last minute due to timely assistance from a cooper who saw the attackers coming, and led Rennyo out through the back. The years immediately following the attack of 1465 forced Rennyo to live a nomadic life. Shortly after he settled among the Katada community, Mt. Hiei threatened to attack again and he fled again until he took refuge under Mii-dera, a powerful rival temple to Mt. Hiei (ironically, both Tendai sect). However, this protection was not enough, and Mt. Hiei attacked the Takada congregation, forcing Rennyo to move further. Due to the ≈ånin War in Japan, the central government was unable to restrain Mt. Hiei and its monastic army. He could not depend on any outside forces to protect his congregations. None of this stopped Rennyo's mission, as he continued to amass more converts in new areas such as Settsu Province and Yoshino Province. In 1469 he would make a trip to the Kant≈ç region, where he found the Shinshu orders there open to his new and refreshing teachings. This was despite the fact that Senjuji dominated the region.  Flight to Hokuriku and Recovery  When pondering where to rebuild Hongan-ji, Rennyo made a pivotal move and decided to build it as far away from the influence of Mt. Hiei as possible, by rebuilding the Hongan-ji in Echizen Province (present-day Fukui Prefecture), at a village called Yoshizaki (ÂêâÂ¥é). This was a remote area conveniently located near a coastal route, with a number of Jodo Shinshu congregations from other sects already present. Rennyo initially proselytized to these congregations in the form of speaking tours, but eventually shifted toward pastoral letters. Many of the letters later compiled by Rennyo's followers date from this period of time. These letters proved effective because they were written in clear, comprehensible Japanese, could be read before a congregation, and were effective in clarifying the meaning of Shinran's original teachings. When Rennyo did visit congregations, he would often sit among the congregation rather than on the raised dais, earning him further respect. Meanwhile, Rennyo sought to curb some of the more egregious behavior of Shinshu followers in order to improve their standing in the larger Buddhist community. He instituted which included such items as: * To not slander the teachings of other schools (rule No. 2) * Not to proclaim Jodo Shinshu teachings while adding other teachings outside the tradition (rule No. 5) * Not to denigrate the provincial governor or constable (rule No. 6) * Not to eat fish or fowl during services. (rule No. 9) * Not to indulge in gambling. (rule No. 11) Once established Yoshizaki, known today as , flourished and adherents from surrounding provinces came to hear Rennyo speak. The congregation became so big that along the way to the new Hongan-ji there were hundreds of lodges set up and run by Shinsh≈´ priests to lodge the travelers. However, as Rennyo drew more followers, including lower-ranking samurai, he became embroiled in a power-struggle in Kaga Province between two brothers of the Togashi family. These followers, who banded together to form the Ikk≈ç-ikki movement, sided with Togashi Masachika in 1473, though they eventually turned on him by 1488. Rennyo kept a delicate balance by maintaining positive relationships with the ruling Ashikaga shogunate in Kyoto and exhorting followers to follow proper conduct in civil society, while at the same time, ministering to the congregation and protecting them from governmental wrath when they rebelled against the authorities.  Return to Kyoto  By 1475, Rennyo returned to the Kyoto provinces with such a following that Mt. Hiei could no longer pose a credible threat to J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ again. Rennyo had secured such status in the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ ranks that he had to begin issuing pastoral letters (or, ofumi) in place of appearances to congregations. During this time, Rennyo established a new form of liturgy (gongy≈ç), incorporating elements that would eventually become the core of Honganji J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ Buddhism. He also rewrote many Buddhist texts into kana, the simple, phonetic Japanese characters, making the texts more accessible for the common person. In 1496, Rennyo sought solitude and retired to a rural area at the mouth of the Yodo River, where he built a small hermitage. The area was known for its \\"long slope,\\" or \\"≈å-saka\\" (Â§ßÈò™) in Japanese. Contemporary documents about Rennyo's life and his hermitage were thus the first to refer to this place by the name Osaka. Rennyo's isolation did not last long, however; his hermitage grew quickly into a temple and surrounding temple town (jinaimachi) as devotees gathered to pay him homage and to hear his teachings. By the time of Rennyo's death three years later (in 1499), the complex had come to be known as the Ishiyama Hongan-ji, and was close to the final shape which would prove to be the greatest fortified temple in Japanese history.  Teachings  Rennyo believed he was restoring his ancestor Shinran's original teachings, which he summed up in a short creed known as the : The Ryogemon is still recited in modern-day Shinshu liturgy as a summation of Jodo Shinshu beliefs. However, Rennyo's teaching also differed from Shinran's in subtle ways: * Rennyo frequently used the term alongside the term that Shinran used. * Rennyo de-emphasized the prohibition against veneration of Shinto kami, and taught they were manifestations of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in keeping with medieval Japanese viewpoints. * Rennyo further elaborated on the notion of kih≈ç ittai (Ê©üÊ≥ï‰∏Ä‰Ωì), whereby the deluded person is united with Amida Buddha through the nembutsu. * Rennyo emphasized the notion of \\"gratitude\\", such that every invocation of the nembutsu after the first one expressed gratitude at being assured rebirth in the Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha. In his letters, he described this as  Writings and Liturgy  As part of Rennyo's reforms, he elevated the status of Shinran's hymn, the , which was originally printed in Shinran's magnum opus, the Kyogyoshinsho. The Shoshinge is the primary liturgy used in Jodo Shinshu services, apart from Buddhist sutras, and is recited every morning at 6:00 at the Nishi Honganji temple services. Further, Rennyo Shonin was the author of several works relating to J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ doctrine. His most influential work is his collection of letters to various Shinshu monto (lay groups), popularly known as in the Nishi Hongan-ji tradition, and in the Higashi Hongan-ji tradition. These letters have the status of scriptural texts and are traditionally used in Shinshu daily liturgy; the most well-known letter is the which is a reflection on the impermanence of life and the importance of relying on Amida Buddha's Vow. This letter is frequently read aloud during J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ funeral services. Rennyo's disciples also recorded things he said in a collection called the , which provides later followers with some insight into his personality and beliefs.  Legacy  Such was Rennyo's importance in reviving Shinran's teachings that he is revered by devotees as the \\"second founder\\" of the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ tradition. For example, Rennyo's image is typically venerated in Jodo Shinshu shrines to the left of AmitƒÅbha Buddha (while Shinran is usually enshrined to the right). Rennyo is credited with bringing Jodo Shinshu teachings to a wider audience through proselytization, and also through his letters, which provided accessible, clear explanations of Shinshu doctrine in comparison to Shinran's writings which used Classical Chinese. Rennyo articulated and clarified Shinran's teachings, provided a simple code of conduct, and reformed the temple hierarchy and liturgy. At the same time, however, there is ongoing debate amongst sectarian scholars as to whether Rennyo's legacy was good for the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ or not. On the one hand Rennyo gave the disorganized Shinsh≈´ movement a coherent structure, translated Shinran's teachings into simpler language, and developed a common liturgy. On the other hand, the process of institutionalization which Rennyo accelerated arguably damaged Shinsh≈´'s egalitarian origins and led to a disjunction between priest-scholars and lay- devotees contrary to Shinran's intention. Furthermore, Rennyo introduced certain doctrinal elements of the rival Seizan J≈çdo Sh≈´ tradition into the Shinsh≈´, and tolerated Shinto kami belief to a greater extent than Shinran. Ultimately though, such debates are moot, as without Rennyo's efforts the Shinsh≈´ would almost certainly have fragmented and been absorbed by other sects. Further, Jodo Shinshu sects that remained independent of the Honganji, such as the Senju-ji sect, do not recognize Rennyo's reforms and innovations. His 500th memorial service was observed in 1998.

Beloved by Mets fans, his attitude was exemplary for a team that lost a modern-era record 120 games in its inaugural season. Kanehl hit the first grand slam in Mets history on July 6, 1962 at the Polo Grounds. Kanehl in 1963 Before making the major leagues, Kanehl played for eight seasons in the New York Yankees' and Cincinnati Reds' minor league systems. In 1962, at age 28, he was given an opportunity to try out for the Mets' opening season. Through spring training, he worked tirelessly for a spot on the roster. He leaped over an outfield wall in pursuit of a ball and he scored from second on a wild pitch. His attitude and all-out play earned him the nickname ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤Hot Rod‚Ä≤‚Ä≤.

French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Melville called The Kremlin Letter \\"masterly\\" and \\"...saw it as establishing the standard for cinema.\\" Plot Late in 1969, a brilliant young United States Navy intelligence officer, Charles Rone, finds his commission revoked so that he can be recruited into an espionage mission. Rone is told that the mission is being undertaken independently of governmental intelligence agencies, as was commonplace prior to World War II, when espionage operations were handled by a small community of agents operating on a freelance basis. Rone is told that the primary operator in that community, a \\"brutal, sadistic, conscienceless assassin\\" named Robert Sturdevant, did not adapt to the post- war shift to government intelligence agencies, along with the disbanding of the independent network of spies, with Sturdevant disappearing and reportedly later committing suicide. Now, the government has suffered a significant failure in an important intelligence operation and has turned back to the independent agents for help. This time, \\"The Highwayman\\", another member of the old group of independent spies is the man leading the effort to reassemble the network to take on this mission. Another member of the group has recently died, and Rone has been tabbed as his replacement, due to Rone's exceptional analytical skills, eidetic memory and ability to speak eight languages with a native accent. Rone meets with The Highwayman and another group member, Ward, the latter of whom takes on the role of Rone's primary tutor. They first task Rone with rounding up three other members of the group: Janis, \\"The Whore\\", a drug dealer and panderer, \\"The Warlock\\", a culturally sophisticated homosexual, and \\"The Erector Set\\", a highly skilled thief and burglar. Janis begs off of the mission, saying that he won't work for The Highwayman, but only for Sturdevant, whom he believes would never have killed himself. Rone finally bribes him into agreeing to participate. The Warlock joins the operation without hesitation, but The Erector Set's hands have become too arthritic to be of use. Instead, he sends his beautiful daughter, B.A., in his place, as he has trained her to be as capable as is he. The group's mission is the retrieval of a letter, written without proper authorization, that promises United States aid to the Soviet Union in destroying Chinese atomic weapons plants. The letter had been solicited on behalf of an unknown high-level Soviet official by Dmitri Polyakov, who had previously been selling Soviet secrets to the United States that he had obtained from that same Soviet official. Upon finding out about the letter, which was a de facto \\"declaration of war against China\\", U.S. and British authorities had contacted Polyakov and arranged to buy it back from him. However, Polyakov then committed suicide after being apprehended by Soviet counter-intelligence, under the direction of Colonel Yakov Kosnov. The group blackmails Captain Potkin, the Soviet head of counter-intelligence in the U.S., threatening his family to force him to allow them the use of his usually-vacant apartment in Moscow. Once they arrive in the Soviet Union, the terminally ill Highwayman sacrifices his life, attempting to divert the attention of Soviet counter-intelligence away from the remainder of the team. Rone is assigned to remain at the apartment with Ward and accept reports verbally from other team members, Rone's memory allowing them to avoid the use of written records. Janis, The Warlock and B.A. then set out to establish themselves in various parts of Russian society as they try to ascertain the identity of Polyakov's contact. Janis enters a partnership with a local brothel operator, who points him to a Chinese man known as \\"The Kitai\\" as a possible source for names of officials and others to whom he can sell heroin, with which Janis already plans to keep the prostitutes addicted. Janis later discerns that the Kitai is also a spy and further happens to spot Kosnov leaving a local night club with a woman whom he discovers was Polyakov's devoted wife, Erika Beck. She is now married to Kosnov, so B.A. plants a listening device in their bedroom. After that, B.A. takes up with a local small-time thief and black market operator, though she finds herself terribly unhappy and wishes only to return home to her father. In the meantime, the Warlock integrates himself into the local community of intellectual homosexuals, starting an affair with a university professor. He then meets one of the professor's students who was Polyakov's former lover and who informs him that Polyakov had had a relationship with Vladimir Bresnavitch of the Soviet Central Committee. Bresnavitch turns out to have an adversarial relationship with Kosnov, whose activities Bresnavitch oversees on behalf of the Committee. According to Kosnov, the animosity between the two men went back many years to when Bresnavitch sought to oust Kosnov from his job, in favor of Sturdevant. Prior to that time, Kosnov and Sturdevant had been friendly, with each one trusting the other to allow his agents to operate in the other's territory. However, with the pressure from Bresnavitch, Kosnov decided he had to do \\"something spectacular\\" to keep his job, so he betrayed Sturdevant's trust and captured his agents, employing a great deal of brutality and earning the lasting enmity of Sturdevant himself. Upon deducing that Bresnavitch had used Polyakov to fence stolen art works in Paris, Ward decides to go there in search of any possible leads. On the day of his return, the group's mission is destroyed when Potkin returns to the Soviet Union and informs Bresnavitch about the operation. Janis, B.A. and Ward are apprehended, while The Warlock commits suicide just before capture and Rone narrowly escapes. Rone tries visiting the Kitai to arrange re-purchase of the letter, but the Kitai responds by trying to kill him and Rone determines that the Chinese have possession of the letter. Rone then turns to Erika, with whom he has been having an affair while posing as a Russian gigolo named Yorgi. He hopes to get her to inquire with her husband about the condition of those captured. She informs him that Kosnov participated in no such capture, and Rone realizes that Bresnavitch quietly orchestrated the raid without the knowledge of Soviet counter-intelligence, a clear indicator that he was Polyakov's traitorous high-level Soviet official contact. Rone's questions reveal to Erika his true identity and he promises to help her escape to the West. She tells him she will try to ascertain the fates of the captured agents and later reports back that B.A. has taken poison and is expected to die, while one of the men is dead and the other has survived and is being held captive. Rone threatens to expose Bresnavitch unless Ward, the surviving agent, is released. Bresnavitch agrees, and Rone and Ward then arrange to leave the next day. Disapproving of Rone's plans to aid Erika, Ward lures her into a trap and kills her. Kosnov believes that her lover Yorgi killed her and tracks down Rone, though unaware of Rone's true identity, in search of revenge. But Ward enters, leading Kosnov to observe that \\"I seem to know you.\\" Ward says that the two men have \\"a lot of old corpses to dig up and talk about.\\" He begins listing the names of the agents betrayed by Kosnov and says that the time has come for retribution, as he shoots Kosnov in the kneecap. Kosnov stares at Ward in disbelief, saying \\"No, it isn't. It can't be.\\" Ward then closes on him off-camera and Kosnov begins screaming in torment. As they head for a plane to leave the country, Rone shares with Ward his conclusions that Ward is in fact Sturdevant and intends to stay, having made a deal with Bresnavitch to take over as the head of Soviet counter-intelligence. Ward denies it, but only coyly, and then reveals that B.A. is not dead. He says that she will be held to ensure that Rone does not reveal the truth about him. Rone, very much in love with B.A., vows that he'll get her back somehow. Ward offers to release B.A. if Rone does \\"one last little thing\\", handing Rone an envelope as Rone boards the plane.

His music concerns topical subjects such as the 2003 Iraq war, anti-globalization and social justice issues. Rovics has been an outspoken critic of former President George W. Bush, the Republican Party, John Kerry, and the Democratic Party. Rovics is critical of the United States government's policies and claims that the \\"U.S. government's foreign policy represents U.S. corporate interests\\" and that \\"the U.S. government does not like democracy either at home or abroad.\\" Although some of Rovics' work is not self- published, and much of it is commercially distributed, Rovics has made all of his recorded music freely available as downloadable mp3 files. He encourages the free distribution of his work by all non-profit means to promote his work and spread political messages, and speaks out against websites or programs like iTunes that charge money for downloading his songs. Rovics has also advocated the performing of his songs at protests and demonstrations and has made his sheet music and lyrics available for download. Biography David Rovics was born in New York City. His family moved to Wilton, Connecticut when he was young. Rovics was politically inspired during his adolescence by his experiences with the conservative-oriented, Christian milieu of his home town. His parents, both classical musicians and educators, were liberal in their outlook. Perhaps for this reason, while in his teens Rovics acquired interests in nuclear disarmament, vegetarianism and other counterculture issues. He has described himself as an \\"anti-Zionist Jew from New York\\". In 1985, Rovics enrolled at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, but dropped out and moved to Berkeley, California. He worked in varied occupations, including as a cook, barista, secretary and typist, while pursuing his musical interests as a street and subway performer and in small clubs and bars. He immersed himself in leftist counterculture and made contact with other songwriters and performers on the underground circuit. By the early 1990s he was a full-time busker in the Boston subways. From around the mid-1990s, Rovics has spent most of his time on concert tours around the world. In 1996 he self-released his first album, Make It So, which consisted mostly of covers of other artists' songs. He released his second cover album in 1998. He produced a series of five original song albums between 1998 and 2003 as self-released titles. The album Who Would Jesus Bomb? was entirely distributed in mp3 format over the Internet and had no commercial release, although it was included in a later \\"best of\\" album. Rovics is a Wobbly- a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. \\"In that Wobbly tradition of sharp social commentary, David is a master.\\" ‚Äî The Industrial Worker. In 2003 Rovics signed up to Ever Reviled Records and produced a studio album, Return. Later that year, he released Behind The Barricades: The Best Of David Rovics in association with AK Press, including titles from his earlier self-releases which met with minimal commercial success. He has since released the Songs for Mahmud album as a self-release in association with Ever Reviled Records. Despite being the sole performer in most of his work, he usually describes himself only as a songwriter. Although Rovics' work has never met with great commercial success, it has been acclaimed in sections of the press and continues to be popular with a small yet widespread base of fans with similar political interests, as well as supporters of internet file sharing. Rovics tours regularly on four continents, playing for audiences large and small at cafes, pubs, universities, churches, union halls and protest rallies. He has had his music featured on Democracy Now!, the BBC, Al-Jazeera, Acik Radyo and other networks. His essays are published regularly on CounterPunch and Truthout and the 200+ songs he makes available on the web have been downloaded more than a million times.

Wast Water is England's deepest lake. Life and career Margaret Hogg had worked as an airline stewardess and her husband, Peter Hogg, was a pilot. He was 19 years older than she. He had achieved front-page news on 16 August 1974 when he landed at Luton Airport as the captain of a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar of Court Line that he had piloted overnight from a refuelling stop at Gander, Canada, bringing Clarksons holidaymakers back from St. Lucia. This was the airline's last flight as Court Line had ceased trading the previous day. Marital stress, murder and disposal in Wastwater Margaret had a three-year affair with banker Graham Ryan, and often flaunted it before Peter. In October 1976 she attacked her husband, hitting and kicking until he \\"grabbed her round the neck and squeezed hard\\". She suffocated and he wrapped her body in a carpet, tied it to a block of concrete, drove north overnight from Surrey and dumped it in Wast Water lake in the Lake District National Park. The body settled at a depth of 34 metres (110 ft), only a short distance away from much deeper parts of the deepest lake in England. Due to the lack of oxygen the body did not decompose, but over time was preserved by the formation of adipocere. Discovery of body In 1983, the lake was searched for the body of Veronique Mireille Marre, a missing French student. Subsequently, the remains of Margaret Hogg were found tied in the fetal position with co-ax cable with a dry-cleaning bag over her head and the body wrapped in a hessian cover, by a diver, Neil Pritt, on 29 February 1984, who initially thought them to be just a roll of old carpet. Shortly after the recovery, the body was identified by friends. The police investigation was made easier by noting \\"Margaret 11.11.63 Peter\\" that was engraved on the inside of the gold wedding ring recovered on the floor of the mortuary at West Cumberland Hospital. Peter Hogg, the prime suspect, initially denied the murder before making a confession. He was sentenced to four years for manslaughter, obstructing a coroner, and perjury in his divorce proceedings.

Community life for the Dutch farmers who settled there began around 1750 and centered on a church, a school, a grist mill and a tavern owned by John Bennett, which historians say was most instrumental in forming the village. The first mill was built by Bergen Huff around 1770 and there was also a tannery which supplied leather to the people of the village as well as to the nearby town of New Brunswick. At one time the area surrounding the Shirk farm and extending along the Sourland Mountains was the largest peach producing region in the State.

He was a renowned expert on rare earth elements, and on extraction of metals from minerals. The uranium extraction process helped make it possible for the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bombs. A graduate of the University of Michigan and University of California, Berkeley, Spedding became an assistant professor and head of the department of physical chemistry at Iowa State College in 1937. His efforts at building up the school were so successful that he would spend the rest of his career there, becoming a professor of chemistry in 1941, a professor of physics in 1950, a professor of metallurgy in 1962, and ultimately professor emeritus in 1973. He co- founded, along with Dr. Harley Wilhelm, the Institute for Atomic Research and the Ames Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission, and directed the Ames Laboratory from its founding in 1947 until 1968. Spedding developed an ion exchange method of separating and purifying rare earth elements using ion exchange resins, and later used ion exchange to separate isotopes of individual elements, including hundreds of grams of almost pure nitrogen-15. He published over 250 peer-reviewed papers, and held 22 patents in his own name and jointly with others. Some 88 students received their Ph.D. degree under his supervision. Early life and education Spedding was born on 22 October 1902, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, the son of Howard Leslie Spedding and Mary Ann Elizabeth (Marshall) Spedding. Soon after he was born, the family moved to Michigan, and then Chicago. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen through his father. The family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his father worked as a photographer, in 1918. He entered the University of Michigan in 1920, receiving a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in chemical engineering in 1925 and a Master of Science (M.S.) in analytical chemistry the following year. As an undergraduate, Spedding took issue with the prevailing explanation by Friedrich August Kekul√© of how the six carbon atoms in benzene hold together and proposed an alternate explanation. His professor, Moses Gomberg, recognised this as being the same as the (incorrect) model advanced by Albert Ladenburg in 1869. At Gomberg's suggestion, Spedding applied to the University of California, Berkeley, to study for his doctorate under Gilbert N. Lewis. Gomberg wrote a recommendation so that Spedding was not only accepted, but given a teaching fellowship as well. Under Lewis's supervision, Spedding earned his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in 1929, writing his thesis on \\"Line absorption spectra in solids at low temperatures in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum\\". It was published that year in the Physical Review. Early career Spedding's graduation coincided with the onset of the Great Depression, and jobs became hard to find. Spedding received a National Research Fellowship from 1930 to 1932, enabling him to stay at Berkeley and continue his research into the spectra of solids. While hiking in northern California, he met Ethel Annie MacFarlane, who shared his passion for camping, hiking and mountain climbing. Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, she was a graduate of the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Toronto, where she had earned a master's degree in history. When they met, she was teaching at Victoria High School in Victoria, British Columbia. They were married on 21 June 1931. They had a daughter, Mary Anne Elizabeth, who was born in 1939. From 1932 to 1934, Spedding worked for Lewis as a chemistry instructor. Around this time, he became interested in the chemistry of the rare earths. These were expensive and hard to find, and generally available only in minute amounts. In 1933 he won the Irving Langmuir Award for most outstanding young chemist. The award came with a cash prize of $1,000. He borrowed money to travel to Chicago to collect it. While he was there, he was approached by a man offering several pounds of europium and samarium. His benefactor was Herbert Newby McCoy, a retired chemistry professor from the University of Chicago, who had obtained a supply of these elements from the Lindsay Light and Chemical Company, where they were a byproduct of thorium production. A few weeks later, Spedding received a package in the mail containing jars of the metals. In 1934, Spedding was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, allowing him to study in Europe. To save money, Spedding and his wife travelled to Europe by heading westward across the Pacific. His intention was to study in Germany under James Franck and Francis Simon, but they fled Germany after Adolf Hitler came to power in March 1933. Instead he went to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England, where he was welcomed by Ralph H. Fowler. Spedding worked with John Lennard-Jones, and attended lectures given by Max Born. He paid a visit to Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, and gave a lecture in Leningrad. When Spedding returned to the United States in 1935, the country was still in the grip of the Great Depression, and the job market had not improved. He was George Fisher Baker assistant professor at Cornell University from 1935 to 1937. It was another temporary position, but it did allow him to work with Hans Bethe. At one point he drove out to Ohio State University hoping to find a tenure track position. The position had already been filled, but the professor of chemistry there, W. L. Evans, knew that Winfred F. (Buck) Coover at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, had a position. \\"I wouldn't normally have chosen the place,\\" Spedding later recalled, \\"but I was desperate. I thought: I can go there and build up physical chemistry and when jobs really open up I can go to another school.\\" Spedding took up the position as assistant professor and head of the department of physical chemistry at Iowa State College in 1937. His efforts at building up the school were so successful that he would spend the rest of his career there, becoming a professor of chemistry in 1941, a professor of physics in 1950, a professor of metallurgy in 1962, and ultimately professor emeritus in 1973. Manhattan Project By February 1942, the United States had entered World War II, and the Manhattan Project was building up. At the University of Chicago, Arthur H. Compton established its Metallurgical Laboratory. Its mission was to build nuclear reactors to create plutonium that would be used in atomic bombs. For advice on assembling the laboratory's Chemistry Division, Compton, a physicist, turned to Herbert McCoy, who had considerable experience with isotopes and radioactive elements. McCoy recommended Spedding as an expert on the rare earth elements, which were chemically similar to the actinide series that included uranium and plutonium.* Compton asked Spedding to become the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's Chemistry Division. Due to lack of space at the University of Chicago, Spedding proposed to organise part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College in Ames, where he had colleagues who were willing to help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first problem on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce. The other major problem was the purity of the uranium. Impurities could act as neutron poisons and prevent a nuclear reactor from working, but the uranium oxide that Fermi wanted for his experimental reactor contained unacceptably large amounts of impurities. As a result, references published before 1942 typically listed its melting point at around when pure uranium metal actually melts at . The most effective way to purify uranium oxide in the laboratory was to take advantage of the fact that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether. Scaling this process up for industrial production was a dangerous proposition; ether was explosive, and a factory using large quantities was likely to blow up or burn down. Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis, Missouri, which had experience with ether. Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt's chemical engineers, Henry V. Farr and John R. Ruhoff, on 17 April 1942. Within a few months, sixty tons of highly pure uranium oxide was produced. Spedding recruited two chemistry professors at Ames for his group there, Harley Wilhelm and I. B. Johns. Spedding and Wilhelm began looking for ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was produced in the form of a powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. The Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched. To produce uranium metal, they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. They then investigated a process (now known as the Ames process) originally developed by J. C. Goggins and others at the University of New Hampshire in 1926. This involved mixing uranium tetrachloride and calcium metal in a calcium oxide-lined steel pressure vessel (known as a \\"bomb\\") and heating it. They were able to reproduce Goggin's results in August 1942, and by September, the Ames Project had produced a ingot. Starting in July 1943, Mallinckrodt, Union Carbide, and DuPont began producing uranium by the Ames process, and Ames phased out its own production by early 1945. As a result, the Ames Laboratory never moved to Chicago, but Spedding was present at the University of Chicago on 2 December 1942, to witness the first controlled nuclear chain reaction in Fermi's Chicago Pile-1. Throughout the war, the laboratory held regular information sessions known as \\"Speddinars\\". In addition to its work with uranium, the Ames Laboratory produced of extremely pure cerium for the cerium sulphide crucibles used by the plutonium metallurgists. Fears that world supplies of uranium were limited led to experiments with thorium, which could be irradiated to produce fissile uranium-233. A calcium reduction process was developed for thorium, and some was produced. Later life After World War II, Spedding founded the Institute for Atomic Research and the Ames Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission. He directed the Ames Laboratory from its founding in 1947 until 1968. It was initially established on the grounds of Iowa State College. Permanent buildings were constructed that were opened in 1948 and 1950, and subsequently named Wilhelm Hall and Spedding Hall. Spedding was \\"universally acknowledged as one of the world‚Äôs foremost experts on the identification and separation of rare earths\\". He developed an ion exchange method of separating and purifying rare earth elements using ion exchange resins. He later used ion exchange to separate isotopes of individual elements, including hundreds of grams of almost pure nitrogen-15. During his career, Spedding published over 260 peer-reviewed papers, and held 22 patents in his own name and jointly with others. Some 88 students received their Ph.D. degree under his supervision. After his retirement in 1972, he authored 60 books. He received the William H. Nichols Award from the American Chemical Society in 1952, the James Douglas Gold Medal from the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers in 1961 and the Francis J. Clamer Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1969. He was nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in chemistry, but never won. An award called the Frank H. Spedding Award is presented at the annual Rare Earth Research Conference. Spedding suffered a stroke in November 1984, and was hospitalised, but sent home. He died suddenly on 15 December 1984, and was buried in the cemetery at Iowa State University. He was survived by his wife, daughter, and three grandchildren. His papers are housed in the Special Collections Department of Iowa State University. NotesReferences * Atomic Heritage Foundation. Frank Spedding. Profiles, Manhattan Project Veterans Database.

Plot Leonora, a prostitute, is despondent over the death of her daughter. Cenci, a lonely young woman, follows Leonora to the cemetery and strikes up a conversation with her, inviting her home. A resemblance to Cenci's late mother becomes obvious once Leonora notices a portrait. Cenci, who is 22 but looks and acts much younger, asks Leonora to stay. A lie is told to her aunts, Hilda and Hannah, that Leonora is actually Cenci's late mother's cousin. Cenci is found one day cowering under a table. Albert, her stepfather, has paid a visit. Cenci is terrified of him, claiming that Albert had raped her. Leonora is repelled by the man's presence until Albert tells her that Cenci is mentally unstable and had repeatedly tried to seduce him. On a beach one day, Cenci and Albert have sexual relations. A despondent Cenci commits suicide. At the funeral, Leonora now knows whom she chooses to believe. After standing beside Albert in silence during the burial, Leonora produces a knife and stabs him. The film ends with Leonora lying in a dingy apartment, listlessly hitting the cord of a ceiling lamp, reciting a poem about perseverance.

In an October 1969 interview with Roger Ebert, Mitchum claimed that the film‚Äôs production was ‚Äúin trouble‚Äù when he arrived and that his presence did not help. Reception Secret Ceremony has divided critics since its release. Renata Adler in the New York Times said that it was ‚Äúincomparably better‚Äù than its predecessor, Accident, and that beneath its ‚Äúelaborate fetishism and dragging prose, there is a touching story of people not helping enough,‚Äù although she admitted that the film had its ‚Äúlongueurs, but not beyond endurance.‚Äù Ernest Callenbach of Film Quarterly said it was ‚Äúdifficult to guess‚Äù what the film was about, but felt that its ‚Äúdominant note, if there is one, is of Losey‚Äôs usual creepy, misanthropic disgust with sex and how people misuse each other to get it.‚Äù He also praised Mia Farrow‚Äôs ‚Äútouching and perverse and human‚Äù performance. Writing 30 years later after its release, John Patterson of The Guardian listed Secret Ceremony among the Losey films he dismissed as ‚Äúwoefully misguided material.‚Äù Similarly, Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader lambasted the film as embodying the director‚Äôs ‚Äúworst tendencies as a filmmaker: the movie is cold without being chilling, confusing without being challenging.‚Äù ReferencesExternal links * 1968 films British films Films shot at Elstree Studios English-language films 1960s thriller drama films Films directed by Joseph Losey Films scored by Richard Rodney Bennett Universal Pictures films Films set in London Films based on Argentine novels British thriller drama films 1968 drama films ","title":"Secret Ceremony"},{"id":"1346717","text":"Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest is a 1993 ambient techno album by the Fireman, a duo consisting of Paul McCartney and producer Youth, who is best known as a member of Killing Joke and the Orb. Background The album consists of samples of McCartney material, mostly from the sessions that spawned his Off the Ground album, as well as samples of \\"Reception\\" and \\"The Broadcast\\" from Wings' 1979 album Back to the Egg, as remixed by Youth. Neither McCartney nor Youth are credited on the album; rumours of McCartney's involvement were eventually confirmed by EMI. The project began when McCartney asked Youth to remix several tracks from McCartney's Off the Ground album for use on possible 12\\" singles. McCartney stated, :\\"The brief from me was that he should only use stuff from our recordings, because dance mixes often feature a kick-drum sample or a James Brown snare sound and, as a consequence, the record ends up sounding a bit like someone else's so I told Youth that I'd prefer any sound he might select to come off our recordings, mainly Off the Ground.\\" Recording Regarding the project, Youth has stated, :\\"I didn't think it appropriate to remix any of the Off the Ground tracks the way I'd been briefed. I thought it would be better to do a more conceptual thing - that is, rather than remix a track I thought we should deconstruct the album into samples and then construct a new mix from those. And Paul liked the idea. He was into it, so I went for it.\\" Eventually, McCartney decided to join Youth in the studio to create new music to add to the tapestry along with the existing samples, and the project became a more collaborative effort. Although originally conceived as a series of 12\\" remixes, McCartney became so enamoured with the results of the sessions that the project became this full-length album. Release and reception In a Melody Maker review, Michael Bonner wrote, :\\"Paul McCartney has discovered dance music - and the results are as staggeringly brilliant as those that came from John Lydon's similar road-to- Damascus-like conversion last year. Truly, we live in an age of miracles. Eschewing the easy option of making a remix album, McCartney and his collaborator, Youth, have chosen to follow the likes of Brian Eno down a more experimental and cerebral path. They take a melody and, with dexterous genre- hopping through ambient, trance and house, evolve a number of breathtaking variations. Like snowflakes, each song seems identical to the last, until closer inspection reveals that it has its own unique shape.\\" Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest was released in the UK on 15 November 1993, and in the US on 14 February 1994.

Constructed in 1924, the sanctuary covers , set both at the foot of, and atop, a cliff. It is a ministry of the Servite Friars, Order of Friar Servants of Mary. A large meditation hall whose main chamber is at clifftop level extends down to the foot of the cliff; the cross on the hill is visible many miles away. In addition to a church, there are several thousand feet of trails, including a trail of the Stations of the Cross, along which visitors may pass in contemplation through botanical gardens. The Grotto also features a full- service Conference Center, and a Gift Shop. History The Grotto was established in 1924 by Friar Ambrose Mayer, a native of Ontario, Canada, who was sent to the United States where he was a Servite pastor for the Archdiosese of Portland, Oregon. Upon moving to Portland, Mayer found acreage located outside Northeast Portland that was at the time owned by the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and had been put up for sale to be developed into residential property. Mayer made a downpayment of $3,000 and purchased the property in 1923.A national campaign raised the balance of the funds needed to pay for the land. Mayer envisioned The Grotto as a natural cathedral, and construction began in September 1923. A cave was carved out of the 110-foot basalt cliff, and a statue of Mary holding Jesus's crucified body was installed. Several years later, a marble recreation of Michelangelo's Piet√† was also installed. Three thousand people gathered for the first mass at the Grotto on May 29, 1924. In 1955, the Chapel of Mary was dedicated on the grounds, and in 1983 the Grotto was designated as a National Sanctuary. The grounds of the Grotto include 62 acres of pathways, forest, and an upper-level botanical garden situated above the cliff, which are accessed through an elevator built against the cliff wall. The upper botanical gardens also provide expansive views of the Columbia River Valley, the Cascade Mountains, and Mount Saint Helens. Vandalism On November 30, 2012, unknown vandals broke into the grounds and vandalized multiple statues. Statues depicting St. Joseph and baby Jesus were beheaded, and a statue of the Virgin Mary was toppled over and also had its head removed. All of the statues were made of centuries-old Carrara marble. Two angel statues were also damaged. The statues have since been replaced or restored.

The neighborhood is bounded by Arverne to the east and Rockaway Park to the west. It is named for the Rockaway Beach and Boardwalk, which is the largest urban beach in the United States, stretching from Beach 3rd to Beach 153rd Streets on the Atlantic Ocean.\\"Chill out this summer ... on an urban beach\\", The Vancouver Sun, June 2, 2007. \\"Rockaway Beach is the largest urban beach in the States.\\" The neighborhood, with 13,000 residents , was once known as the \\"Irish Riviera\\" because of the large Irish American population in the area. History=Early development Rockaway Beach in the 1880s, with new railroad and resort hotel What is now Rockaway Beach was formerly two different hamlets, Holland and Hammels. In 1857, Michael P. Holland had purchased land and named the area after himself. Soon afterward, Louis Hammel, an immigrant from Germany, bought a tract of land just east of Holland. In 1878, he decided to give portions of his land to the New York, Woodhaven and Rockaway Railroad in order to build a railroad station for the peninsula. The area around it became collectively known as \\"Hammels\\". On June 11, 1897, Hammels merged with Holland and they incorporated as the Village of Rockaway Beach. One year later, it was incorporated into the City of Greater New York and became part of the newly formed borough of Queens. However, the neighborhood, along with the eastern communities of Arverne and Far Rockaway, tried to secede from the city several times. In 1915 and 1917, a bill approving the secession passed in the legislature but was vetoed by the mayor at the time, John Purroy Mitchel. Police station Firehouse In the early 1900s, the newly built railroad station opened up the community and the rest of the peninsula to a broad range of the population. The wealthy no longer had a monopoly on the peninsula, as various amusement parks, stores, and resort hotels attracted people from all over the city to spend a day or a whole summer there. Much of the area was developed by James S. Remsen and William Wainwright. In this era, it became known as \\"New York's Playground\\". Rockaway's famous amusement park, Rockaways' Playland, was built in 1901 and quickly became a major attraction for people around the region. With its growing popularity, concern over swimming etiquette became a problem and early in 1904, the Captain of the NYPD, Louis Kreuscher, issued rules for those using the beach, censoring the bathing suits to be worn, where photographs could be taken, and specifying that women in bathing suits were not allowed to leave the beachfront. The park was grand for its time. One of its most popular attractions, the Atom Smasher roller coaster, would be featured in the beginning of This is Cinerama, a pre-IMAX type movie, in 1952. An Olympic-size swimming pool and a million-dollar midway also were built within the amusement park; they would serve the community for over eighty years. The Temple of Israel Synagogue was built in 1921, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. 1930s‚Äì1960s In the 1930s, Robert Moses came to power as New York City's Parks Commissioner and his extensive road and transportation projects were both a benefit and disaster for the neighborhood. As commissioner, Moses ordered the construction of the Marine Parkway Bridge and the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge. The bridges were completed in 1937 and 1939 respectively. The Marine Parkway Bridge was built further west on the peninsula between Jacob Riis Park and Breezy Point linking the isolated communities to Brooklyn. The Cross Bay Bridge landed in the middle of the neighborhood of Rockaway Beach.Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, Historical Overview, NUCRoads.com. Accessed December 6, 2006. The new bridge made the community the peninsula's gateway to Queens as it provided the only direct car access to the borough. The construction of the two bridges started to transform the neighborhood and the rest of the peninsula into a more year- round residential area or commuter town, as people had a more convenient way to travel to and from work. The conversion of the Rockaway Beach LIRR branch to the Rockaway subway line also brought an increase to Rockaway's permanent residents. Although the bridges were intended to improve the Rockaways, Moses' other projects both directly and indirectly hurt the community. One such failed project was the planned construction of the Shore Front Parkway in the 1950s and 1960s. Wanting to connect Staten Island to the Hamptons, Moses focused on making a highway through the Rockaway Peninsula. His idea was to connect the Marine Parkway Bridge with the Atlantic Beach Bridge, which connected the Rockaway Peninsula to Nassau County. The plan would also provide an extension midway through to include the Cross Bay Bridge. Many feared that such an extensive project would do more harm to the peninsula than good and pointed to the community displacement that had happened in the South Bronx because of Moses' roadway construction Although Moses never got to make his highway, he did leave his mark. A piece of the planned parkway that ran west to east in the Rockaway Park and Rockaway Beach neighborhoods was constructed and opened in 1939. Houses were literally cut in half in order to build the four-lane street. Some of these houses are still standing today. The existing, still unfinished street is locally known as the \\"road from nowhere to nowhere\\" because it does not have any relevant connections to any other area or highway. Hammel Houses Robert Moses' construction of other recreational areas and facilities, such as the New York Aquarium and Jones Beach State Park, indirectly impacted the neighborhood as well. These more modern recreational facilities lured tourists and beachgoers away from the peninsula. With fewer customers, businesses and hotels closed, and by the 1950s, the area had fallen into economic decline. The transition from a summer vacationing area to a full-time residential neighborhood had taken its toll.Hammel Playground, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, accessed December 6, 2006. In an effort to revitalize the neighborhood, the city constructed the Hammel Houses. This project would be one of the many so-called urban renewal efforts that dominated the community and much of its eastern neighbors in the last half of the 20th century. The New York City Housing Authority purchased the land in 1952 on the north side of the elevated track. In 1964, the Authority decided to demolish and rebuild the entire area to what it is today. Women veterans memorial In addition to the Hammel Houses, the Dayton Beach Park Cooperative, which, unlike the Hammel Houses, are not projects, was constructed on the south side of the community. The rectangular buildings, all of them thirteen stories high, were placed in close proximity to the shoreline. The building was completed by the end of the 1960s along with the similar looking Surfside Park Apartments and Dayton Towers West in nearby Rockaway Park. The buildings still dominate Rockaway Beach's skyline today, nestled between Rockaway Beach Boulevard to the north and Shore Front Parkway to the south. The Rockaway Courthouse was built in 1931; it served as a local Municipal and Magistrate's Court and was last used as a civic building in 1962.

The art form draws its immediate resources and inspiration from way back about 1600 AD, a period when the Nayakas of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas encouraged art‚Äîchiefly, classical dance and music‚Äîas well as literature, both in Telugu and Tamil and painting of chiefly Hindu religious subjects in temples. It is distinguished by its famous gold coating. However, it can safely be surmised that Thanjavur painting, as we know it now, originated in the Maratha court of Thanjavur (1676‚Äì1855). It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2007-08. Thanjavur paintings are characterised by rich and vivid colors, simple iconic composition, glittering gold foils overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work and inlay of glass beads and pieces or very rarely precious and semi- precious gems. In Thanjavur paintings one can see the influence of Deccani, Vijayanagar, Maratha and even European or Company styles of painting. Essentially serving as devotional icons, the subjects of most paintings are Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints. Episodes from Hindu Puranas, Sthala-puranas and other religious texts were visualised, sketched or traced and painted with the main figure or figures placed in the central section of the picture (mostly within an architecturally delineated space such as a mantapa or prabhavali) surrounded by several subsidiary figures, themes and subjects. There are also many instances when Jain, Sikh, Muslim, other religious and even secular subjects were depicted in Tanjore paintings. Nataraja flanked by Sivagami, circa 19th century Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana ‚Äì 20th century Thanjavur paintings are panel paintings done on wooden planks, and hence referred to as palagai padam (palagai = \\"wooden plank\\"; padam = \\"picture\\") in local parlance.

History = Introduction  Thanjavur has a unique place in the history of Indian painting, in that it houses the 11th century Chola wall paintings in the Brihadeeswarar temple (Periya koyil or Pervudaiyar koyil in Tamil) as also paintings from the Nayak period (many times superimposed on the earlier Chola paintingsPreserving the past ‚Äì Unique achievement by archaeologists in restoring Thanjavur paintings ‚Äì S.H.

The fall of the Vijayanagar Empire and the sack of Hampi in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 CE resulted in the migration of painters who had been dependent on the patronage of the empire. Some of them migrated to Thanjavur and worked under the patronage of the Thanjavur Nayakas. Subsequently, the Maratha rulers who defeated the Thanjavur Nayakas began to nurture the Thanjavur atelier. Needless to say, the artists absorbed the local influences and the individual tastes of their Maratha patrons which helped evolve the unique Thanjavur style of painting. The Thanjavur artists in addition to decorating temples also began painting and decorating the major buildings, palaces, chatrams and residences of the Maratha kings and nobility. Nayaka period paintings in the Peruvudaiyar Koil Processional scene with Amar Singh, ruler of Thanjavur (1787‚Äì98) and Sarabhoji (1798‚Äì1832) ‚Äì note the gilded chariots being pulled by Bulls  Vijayanagara Rayas  The Vijayanagar empire, founded by Harihara and Bukka, was for long a bulwark against the rapidly advancing Islamic influence from the nearby Deccan and the farther North. While the foreign influences did gradually percolate into the Peninsular South, the Vijayanagar empire ensured that the older Hindu artistic traditions were protected and preserved. The empire had reached its zenith under Krishnadevaraya (1509‚Äì29). Its territory stretched across the entire South Indian peninsula, from the Tungabhadra river in the North to Kanyakumari in the south and the Malabar coast on the Arabian sea in the west to the Coromandel coast on the Bay of Bengal in the east at its peak. In 1521‚Äì22, Krishnadevaraya travelled to the Tamil country (Tamilagam) visiting holy places and as was his wont, made munificent donations to temples and other religious establishments. It can be surmised that some of this munificence was also channeled into art and artists.  Thanjavur Nayakas  The Vijayanagar Rayas administered their vast kingdom through Nayaka Governors who also administered the outlying provinces or states under the supervision of the Raya. The third important Nayaka state in Tamil country, Thanjavur, (Senji and Madurai being the others) had been established under the reign of Krishnadevaraya's half-brother and successor Achyutaraya (1529‚Äì42). The Thanjavur Nayaka line commenced with Sevappa Nayaka (1532‚Äì72). Sevappa ruled for several years, ably supported by his son Achyutappa (1564‚Äì1614), who later succeeded him. It was during Achyutappa's reign that the Vijayanagara empire fell, leading to the exodus of numerous litterateurs, philosophers, musicians and artists who migrated to several other neighbouring kingdoms like Mysore and Thanjavur. Achyutappa was succeeded by his son Raghunatha Nayaka who in turn was succeeded by Vijayaraghava Nayaka. Raghunatha, who was possibly the most successful Thanjavur Nayaka ruler, was also a great patron of art and artists and helped establish the unique school of Thanjavur artists who later evolved the Thanjavur style of paintings under the Marathas. A Tanjore Glass painting of Venugopala Krishna flanked by Gopikas  Marathas  Due to internal dissensions in the Nayaka line, Ekoji otherwise called Venkoji (1676‚Äì83), half-brother of Chatrapati Shivaji marched into Thanjavur on behalf of the Adil Shah of Bijapur under whom he was a General. He subsequently captured Thanjavur and established the Maratha rule. Despite intermittent wars, when Thanjavur was overrun first by the Nawab of Arcot and later by Haidar Ali, Ekoji and his successors like Tulajaji, Serfoji II (Sarabhoji in Tamil) and others remained great patrons of the arts and artists. By the time Serfoji II succeeded to the Maratha throne in Thanjavur, the Britishers had taken over the complete administration of the state, retaining the king in only a nominal capacity to exercise power over the fort and a smidgen of surrounding lands . Though Serfoji II had to fight off a spirited competition from Amarasimha, his paternal uncle, to the Maratha throne of Thanjavur, it was during his reignThanjavur ‚Äì A Cultural History by Pradeep Chakravarthy Published by Niyogi books that Thanjavur painting flourished and reached the form and style in which we recognise it today. Serfoji II had to traverse a difficult path throughout his reign, being constantly challenged by Amarasimha who ran a parallel court in Thiruvidaimarudur even after his accession. However, despite the troubled times, Serfoji's reign was a time of great innovations in Thanjavur art and many other parallel fields. The Maratha rule came to a sad end after the death of its last ruler Shivaji II, (resembling only in name his vastly greater ancestor) who died without a male issue, when the Britishers obliged by annexing the Thanjavur state to its dominions under the notorious Doctrine of Lapse. After the Maratha rule waned, the mercantile Chettiar community continued to patronise the Thanjavur artists. The Chettiars being staunch Shaivites encouraged Shaivite themes. One of their monasteries in Koviloor has large Thanjavur paintings on the lives of the 63 Nayanmars (Saivaite saints) and the 64 miracles (Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam) of Lord Shiva minutely labelled in Tamil.Thanjavur Paintings in Koviloor By C. Nachiappan Hardcover Kalakshetra Publications 14 Nov 2004, 1st ed. Similarly, the Bhimarajagoswami monastery in Thanjavur has a large painting of 108 Vishnu temples. The Britishers who had come into Thanjavur in the wake of the Anglo- Mysore wars also patronised Thanjavur artists and their paintings.  Style and Technique  Thanjavur paintings were made in various sizes depending upon the function, the subject and the choice of the patron. Large paintings of deities and the Maratha rulers, their courtiers and nobility, were painted and installed to serve as architectural accents in the Maratha palaces and buildings. To quote Dallapiccola ‚Äì ' The works, executed on canvas pasted on a wooden support, were framed ‚Äì a major departure from the pan-Indian tradition, in which paintings are of small size ‚Äì and designed to be hung on the walls of domestic puja rooms or in bhajan halls. The themes, as in painted albums, (made for European patrons) were usually gods and goddesses, holy places, religious personalities and occasionally portraits. Their dazzling palette consisted generally of vivid reds, deep greens, chalk white, turquoise blues and the lavish use of gold (foil) and inset glass beads. Sometimes precious stones were also used in the paintings. The large format of the majority of such works and the relatively simple composition are the hallmark of the style. This school was greatly inspired by European techniques and was the most popular in Tamil Nadu until the early twentieth century.South Indian Paintings ‚Äì A catalogue of the British Museum collection by A. L. Dallapiccola Published by Mapin Publishing in association with the British Museum Press' Paintings in addition to being done on canvas, were also done on walls, wooden panel, glass, paper, mica and exotic media such as ivory. Small Ivory portraits were typically worn as cameo pendants called rajaharam and were quite popular. Thanjavur glass paintings following the techniques of Chinese reverse glass paintings were popularised during Serfoji II's reign as a cheaper and faster craft. The paintings were done on the reverse surface of a glass sheet with strips of metal beaten into transparent gaps to simulate the effect of jewellery and precious stones. Most of the paintings were of Hindu deities & saints. Other courtly and secular portraits were also created. Tanjore Glass painting of Raja Sarabhoji A Thanjavur Painting was generally made on a canvas pasted over a plank of wood (Jackfruit or teak) with Arabic gum. The canvas was then evenly coated with a paste of French chalk (gopi) or powdered limestone and a binding medium and dried. The artist then drew or traced using a stencil, a detailed outline of the main and subsidiary subjects on the canvas. A paste, made of limestone powder and a binding medium called sukkan or makku, was used for creating the Gesso work. Gold leaves and gems of varied hues were inlaid in selected areas like pillars, arches, thrones, dresses, etc. Finally, colours were applied on the sketch. In the past, artists used natural colours like vegetable and mineral dyes, whereas the present day artists use chemical paints. For outlines dark brown or red was usually used. Red was favoured for the background, though blue and green were also used. Lord Vishnu, was coloured blue, and Lord Nataraja chalk white, and his consort Goddess Sivakami was green. The sky, of course, was blue, but black was also employed on occasions. The portrayal of figures in the paintings was also typical with almost all the figures having rounded faces with almond-shaped eyes and smooth, streamlined bodies. The composition is static and two-dimensional with the figures placed within arches, curtains and decorative borders. The main subject is much larger than the other subjects and occupies the centre of the painting. Seraphs or angels resembling those in European paintings and Islamic miniatures were also shown flanking the main figure. The figures were painted with bright flat colours except for the face where shading was shown. The shading in Thanjavur art was more to create a feeling of depth than to conform to the European conventions of lighting and perspective. There are some examples of this art in the Saraswathi Mahal Library, in Tanjore built by Serfoji II. The Sanskrit work Prabotha Chandrodayam in the library has a few pages of Tanjore art as also Marathi translations of Mahabharata & Bhagavatham in which are found the works of the painter Madhava swami dated 1824 AD. Faint traces of Maratha style paintings inset with glass are found on the walls of the Thiruvaiyaru Chatram built by Serfoji after his pilgrimage to Kashi. Many other buildings in and around Thanjavur have fine examples of the paintings on the roofs and walls, though many are gradually disappearing and dying due to serious neglect and stupid acts of vandalism. The Government Museum, Chennai and the Thanjavur Art Gallery,Frommer's India by Pippa de Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice, Shonar Joshi Thanjavur also house fine collections of Thanjavur paintings depicting the Maratha kings of Thanjavur and other allied subjects. Many private museums and collectors also possess enviable collections of Thanjavur paintings.Hasta Shilpa heritage village, Manipal The British and Victoria & Albert museums in England also house a large collection of Thanjavur paintings in the company and traditional styles. The National Museum of Copenhagen also houses a fine collection of 17th century Thanjavur paintings. King Christian IV of Denmark had received permission to build a fort at Tranquebar (Tharangambadi in Tamil) which led to the building of the Danesborg fort as also a Danish relationship with Thanjavur which resulted in the museum collection.Chiang Mai & Northern Thailand Footprint Focus Guide By Andrew Spooner  Artists  Tanjore paintings were painted by 'Moochys or Artists of India' according to the British chronicler Charles Gold in his book Oriental Drawings published in 1806. Traditionally, it is well known that the Raju community of Thanjavur and Tiruchi, also called as Jinigara or Chitragara and the Nayudu community of Madurai were the artists who executed paintings in the Thanjavur style.Tanjore Paintings, A Chapter in Indian Art History by N. S. 'Kora' Ramaswami The artists (Rajus & Naidus) were originally Telugu speaking people from the artistically vibrant \\"Rayalseema\\" region of Andhra, who moved to Tamil Nadu in the wake of the fall of the Vijayanagar empire and the establishment of Nayak rule in Madurai and Thanjavur. The artists turned out a wide repertoire of paintings on different subjects and of varied quality depending upon the patron's interest, urgency and most importantly influence and financial capacity. However, the art was by and large a sacred task to be performed with a reasonable degree of ritual purity and humility by the master craftsmen, many of whom chose to remain anonymous and never signed their paintings, true to the Indian artistic tradition. However a few works signed by the Thanjavur artists are also known. C. Kondiah Raju, the famous calendar artist from Kovilpatti, was one of the illustrious descendants to make a name as an artist during modern times from the Raju community.  Influences  Tirupati painting of Lord Venkateshwarar in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London The Tanjore style of paintings spring from a late phase of South Indian classical art, when the society in which it originated was itself going through turbulent times. Needless to say, Tanjore paintings are informed by a syncretic style, notable for its assimilation of the contemporary diverse cultural influences ‚Äì Tamil, Telugu, Maratha, European, Deccani, Folk, etc. The style drew heavily from the other major South Indian styles of painting which were all deeply influenced by the Vijayanagar school. The closest influences among these could be the Kalamkari and Tirupati paintings. A portable wooden shrine carrying painted terracotta plaques of Tirupati Venkateswarar and consorts- Circa 19th century CE Tirupati paintings, in particular were produced in the famous temple town using different media and techniques, like painted terracotta reliefs, brass repousse works, paintings on paper and canvas, etc. The commonest examples were painted and gilded terracotta relief slabs of the deity, framed and packaged in neat wooden boxes which could be carried back as holy memorabilia and worshipped in the Puja room by the pilgrim-devotee. Paintings of the main deity, gilded and gem-set, in a manner similar to Tanjore paintings are also known. A painted brass repousse of Tirupati Balaji. Circa 19th century CE. Tanjore paintings were also closely related to the crafts of painted and carved wood on the one hand and gilded, stone set jewellery work which flourished in Thanjavur. It is also pertinent to remember that Thanjavur art was functional, in that it was made for a specific purpose on a specific demand from a customer. And it is also in the same context that one understands the iconic style of Thanjavur paintings in contrast to say, the Pahari miniatures or even Surpur paintings.Tanjavur Painting of the Maratha Period, By Jaya Appasamy Published by Abhinav publications A Tanjore painting of Vayu on mica in the collection of Government Museum, Chennai  Tanjore and Mysore paintings  Tanjore and Mysore paintings, both spring from the same source ‚Äì Vijayanagara paintings to begin with and Nayaka paintings subsequently. The very same artists, Chitragars and Naidus migrated to various places including Thanjavur and Mysore. This is the reason for the remarkable degree of similarity between the two styles. However, there are many differences that can be made out by the discerning viewer. The differences are largely in the techniques used to create these artworks and in their distinct iconography. The techniques adopted by the Mysore artists are slightly different from those of the Tanjore School. While Tanjore School used white lime powder and powdered tamarind seeds with gum arabic on cloth stretched on wooden panels, Mysore artists used white lead powder (Makhisafeda) or Makhi Gamboge (yellow) drawn from the juice of the indigenous tree (Revana Chinni halu) on paper. The paper sometimes was pasted to a wooden board, but mostly was framed as it was. As against the high relief of the Tanjore 'Gesso' work used prominently across large areas of the painting, the Mysore school preferred low relief, in selected areas such as jewellery, clothing, and borders. The Mysore school used pure gold leaf in lesser quantity as against gold-coated silver leaf handled across larger areas in the painting by Tanjore artists. The use of glass beads, precious and semi precious stones is also very rare in Mysore paintings. More elaborate and detailed interior and exterior landscapes are featured in Mysore paintings, whereas Tanjore paintings tend to be more iconic and static. In Mysore paintings, the jewellery, costumes, architectural features, furniture, etc. reflect the contemporary style prevalent in the Mysore Palace. The throne on which Gods and Goddesses are shown seated is usually a replica of the Mysore throne in many Mysore paintings.A History of Indian Painting : The Modern Period by Krishna Chaitanya pages 36 & 37 Both styles however, frequently show traditional temple pavilions (prabhavalis) and towers particularly for framing the main characters. However the geographical proximity, constant transmigration of artists and a heavy cross fertilisation of ideas and techniques ensured that one could see Tanjore paintings employing Mysore techniques and vice versa.  Tanjore paintings in Company style  Rama and Hanuman fighting Ravana, an album painting on paper, c1820 ‚Äì British Museum Collection Many of the traditional Indian artists were also patronised by Europeans, beginning with the Portuguese who landed on the west coast in 1498. Gradually the other Europeans followed suit and commissioned local artists to paint in the so-called company style. While no specific character or technique marked out the Company school of paintings, it can be understood to mean the large body of paintings painted by Indian artists in a mixed Indo-European style which would appeal to the Europeans who were employed by the various East India Companies. The deity Yama with fangs and holding a da·πá·∏ça (a rod), circa 1814 ‚Äì British Museum Collection The direct European impact on Tanjore paintings began with the stationing of a British garrison in Thanjavur in 1773, during the Anglo-Mysore Wars of 1767‚Äì99. Throughout the nineteenth century, artists based in and around Thanjavur prepared, by and large a standard sets of paintings for the Company personnel. These sets were called albums or album paintings and were a collection of 'native' or 'Indian' subjects of interest, suited to the English sensibilities and tastes. Common subjects were Gods and Goddesses, episodes from Hindu mythology; Fairs, ceremonies, processions and festivals; Castes, their occupations and dresses; Indian Flora and Fauna, etc. These paintings were executed by the same Tanjore artists in a style suited to western tastes. The paintings were usually executed on European paper, without gesso work, little or no Gold foil and without any glass or gem inlay. The paintings would also carry a brief description ( most times extremely quaint and so typically English) of the subject in English and sometimes in Tamil or Telugu. Paintings on cloth backed by wooden panels were also executed for the English patrons. Many of these were carried to England where they probably enlivened many an evening tea! The British Museum and The Victoria and Albert Museum have an enviable collection of such paintings. Though the British patronised paintings tend to be grouped under the Company style of paintings, they were Tanjore paintings in spirit. In addition to being executed by the same traditional group of artists in Thanjavur and the neighbouring Tamil country, the style and characterisation in these paintings are very typically Thanjavur as against the style of say, Company paintings executed in Calcutta or Lucknow.  Modern Times  Thanjavur paintings continue to be made even to the present day, though not with the rigour and virtuosity that marked the paintings of yore. 'Revival' programmes, Exhibitions, Workshops and Training camps on Thanjavur paintings are being held regularly by many institutions including State Governments. The materials used have also changed according to the cost, ease of availability and the choice of individual artists. Plywood, for example has by and large replaced Jack and teak wood. Synthetic colours and adhesives are preferred over the natural and mineral colours and other traditional components. Muck powder, a fine powder of chalk, is also used to create a 3D effect in the paintings. In addition to the traditional subjects, a wide range of popular and modern subjects and themes are being depicted in Thanjavur paintings. While it is a happy development that this traditional art continues to hold its sway, the brazen commercialisation and lack of aesthetics are disturbing trends. Be that as it may, Thanjavur paintings ‚Äì the style and aesthetics continue to inspire many contemporary artists. The Calendar prints of C. Kondiah Raju and his student followers, marked by an iconic solidness as against the western naturalism of Raja Ravi Varma, are examples of the continued influence of Tanjore paintings in modern, popular and academic art. Artists have taken this old form of art and over the years combined it with other styles to create mixed media arts. For example, tanjores are also done on mirrors, glass and canvas. The idea of applying gold foil is unique to this traditional art, so this same style is taken and recreated on different mediums.

In motorsport, a safety car or pace car is a car which limits the speed of competing cars on a racetrack in the case of a caution period such as an obstruction on the track or bad weather. The aim of the safety car is to enable the clearance of any obstruction under safer conditions, especially for marshals and/or await more favourable track conditions weather-wise. During a caution period the safety car (which generally consists of an aptly modified high-performance production car) enters the track ahead of the leader. Depending on the regulations in effect, competitors are not normally allowed to pass the safety car or other competitors during a caution period, and the safety car leads the field at a pre-determined safe speed, which may vary by series and circuit. At the end of the caution period, the safety car leaves the track and the competitors resume normal racing. The first reliance on this safety measure occurred with the deployment of a pace car during the inaugural Indianapolis 500 in 1911. Effect Two Superleague Formula safety cars in the paddock at Silverstone Circuit The use of a safety car has the effect of bunching up competitors together, such as to eliminate any time and distance advantage that a leading driver may have had over the remaining field of competitors. This effect can make racing more competitive upon full race resumption; conversely, it has also contributed to faster leading drivers being negated just rewards for their efforts prior to the caution period. Subject to the racing regulations in force, it is not uncommon for drivers to be allowed to make pitstops during safety car periods. This situation may provide a strategic advantage since any scheduled refueling, tire change or maintenance may be carried out while other competitors are lapping at lower speed, and the drivers who pit then simply rejoin a queue of cars all running together. During normal racing conditions, such interventions would typically involve losing significant terrain over those drivers that remain on-track. Another notable effect of safety car periods is that racing cars consume less fuel until full race resumption, which can allow competitors to run longer distances on a tank of fuel than would otherwise have been possible and/or reduce the number of pitstops required for the duration of the race. Formula One When required, the F1 safety car will lead the field around the circuit at reduced speed with the race leader immediately following. Procedure In Formula One if an accident or inclement weather (typically, heavy rain) prevents normal racing from continuing safely, the Race Director will call for a \\"safety car\\" period, which would see marshals wave yellow flags and hold \\"SC\\" boards, pending the car in question entering the track. From 2007, all Formula One cars must have LEDs and/or displays fitted to the steering wheel or cockpit, which inform the driver which flags are being waved. A yellow LED is illuminated when the safety car is deployed. The safety car has both orange and green lights mounted on its roof in the form of a light bar. The green lights are used to signal that it is possible to overtake the safety car; this is only done until the race leader is immediately behind the safety car and at the head of the queue of race cars following. Bernd Mayl√§nder, the F1 safety car driver since From 2015, the safety car is not required to wait until all backmarkers have caught back up to the queue. When the safety car is ready to leave the circuit, it will turn off its orange lights to indicate that it will enter the pit lane at the end of the lap. Drivers must continue in formation until they cross the first safety car line, where circuit green lights and flags will indicate they are free to race again.https://www.formula1.com/content/fom- website/en/championship/inside-f1/rules- regs/Safety_car_Virtual_Safety_Car_and_Suspending_and_resuming_a_race.html The safety car is piloted by professional drivers (since 2000, by Bernd Mayl√§nder) on-board high-powered modified vehicles supplied by Mercedes- Benz,http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1082569_mercedes-benz-tells-the- history-of-the-f1-safety-car-video and must maintain a reasonable speed so as to ensure that the competitors' tyres are as close as possible to operating temperature and their engines do not overheat. The driver of the safety car is accompanied by a co-driver to assist with operations and communications. For incidents during the first three laps, the safety car also has an advantage over the traditional red flag; with a red flag, it would take a minimum of fifteen minutes to restart the race, and the two-hour limit would not start until the cars were ready for a second formation lap. With regards to the time limit, the race is being scored and the time is also counting while the safety car is on the track, and the race resumes. History The first use of a safety car in Formula One is reported to have taken place at the 1973 Canadian Grand Prix, where a yellow Porsche 914 was called for duty following various incidents under treacherous weather conditions. Controversially, on that occasion, it took several hours after the race to figure out the winner and final results since the safety car driver had placed his car in front of the wrong competitor thus causing part of the field to be one lap down incorrectly. Since , the Mercedes-AMG GT is Formula One's safety car. The sport officially introduced safety cars in , after trials were conducted at both the French and British Grands Prix during the preceding season. Since 1996, as part of promotional arrangements, the supplier of safety cars has been Mercedes-Benz, unlike previous years that have seen cars of different brands being used throughout the season and depending on the track visited (for example, the exotic Lamborghini Countach for the Monaco Grand Prix in the 1980s to the more mundane Fiat Tempra used at the rain-affected 1993 Brazilian Grand Prixhttp://www.enterf1.com/blog/049-the-bite-point and the high performance version of the Opel Vectra used at the infamous 1994 San Marino Grand Prixhttp://www.carmagazine.co.uk/features/top-10s/the-car- top-10-f1-safety-cars). From 2007, new procedures were applied for the first time during the Bahrain Grand Prix. The pit lane was closed immediately upon the deployment of the safety car. No car could enter the pits until all cars on the track had formed up in a line behind the safety car, they passed the pit entrance, and the message \\"pit lane open\\" was given. A ten-second stop/go penalty (which must be taken when the race is resumed) was imposed on any driver who entered the pit lane before the pit lane open message is given. However, any car which was in the pit entry or pit lane when the safety car was deployed would not incur a penalty. From 2009, however, this procedure has been dropped, and replaced by software that calculates where a car is on the track and a minimum lap time it should take the car to get to the pits. Cars that enter the pits before this time limit has expired are penalised. When the safety car and the drivers behind it are on the start/finish straight, there is a red light at the exit of the pit lane. Drivers who go past the red light are disqualified from the race. This has happened to several drivers during the years, such as Giancarlo Fisichella and Felipe Massa in the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix. At the same race a year later, Lewis Hamilton failed to notice the red light and slammed into the back of the car of Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen, who was waiting at the end of the pit lane alongside Robert Kubica. Audi RS 4 - safety car at racing 24 Hours of Le Mans From 2010, once cars were lined up behind the safety car, lapped cars were no longer allowed to unlap themselves before the race was restarted. This rule was abandoned from the 2012 season onwards, with cars now allowed to unlap themselves before the race resumes; however, since 2015, the safety car need not wait for the backmarkers to catch up with the leading pack before returning to the pits. =Chronology of Formula One safety cars= *Porsche 914 - 1973 Canadian Grand Prix *Porsche - 1976 Canadian Grand Prix *Fiat Tempra 16V - 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix *Opel Vectra - 1994 San Marino Grand Prix *Honda Prelude - 1994 Japanese Grand Prix *Porsche 911 GT2 - 1995 Belgian Grand Prix *Renault Clio - 1996 Argentine Grand Prix *Mercedes C36 AMG - to (2 times deployed, 11 laps) *Mercedes CLK55 AMG - to (12 times deployed, 30 laps) *Mercedes CL55 AMG - to (17 times deployed, 45 laps) *Mercedes SL 55 AMG - to (10 times deployed, 39 laps) *Mercedes CLK 55 AMG - (12 times deployed, 29 laps) *Mercedes SLK 55 AMG - to (17 times deployed, 59 laps) *Mercedes CLK 63 AMG - to (22 times deployed, 80 laps) *Mercedes SL 63 AMG - to (24 times deployed, 86 laps) *Mercedes SLS AMG - to (68 times deployed, 253 laps) *Mercedes-AMG GT S - to (37 times deployed, 142 laps) *Mercedes-AMG GT R - to current Virtual safety car (VSC) Following an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, which saw driver Jules Bianchi suffer a serious head injury which led to his death, the FIA established an \\"accident panel\\" to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimize the risk of a crash during similar circumstances that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with yellow flags. The accident panel recommended the implementation of a \\"virtual safety car\\", based on the \\"slow zone\\" system used in Le Mans racing. Compared to the former, the safety car does not actually appear on the track; however. On top of not being allowed to overtake under yellow flag conditions in the affected sector, a \\"VSC\\" icon would appear trackside and on the drivers' steering displays, obliging drivers to not exceed the posted speed limit, thus resulting in a 35% speed reduction. The system was similar to the Electro- PACER lights used in the Indianapolis 500 races from 1972 until 1978, except that engine control units (ECU) were involved and could enforce speed limits under the current system. The VSC was tested over the course of the final three races of the season, during parts of free practice sessions. The system was evolved taking into account drivers' feedback and was officially introduced for the season following ratification by the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC). The VSC was officially used for the first time ‚Äì and for a brief period prior to the deployment of the actual safety car ‚Äì at the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, following a 30G crash involving Max Verstappen. The system saw its first extended deployment at the 2015 British Grand Prix after Carlos Sainz Jr.'s power unit failed at Club Corner of the Silverstone Circuit. All drivers must keep their delta times positive, as demonstrated on the F1 games. Formula E The BMW i8 plug-in hybrid is the safety car of Formula E. The Full Course Yellow condition is the Formula E version of the Virtual Safety Car. In this condition, all marshal posts will wave yellow flags, accompanied by a sign that says \\"FCY\\" with a yellow background. This condition is often decided by the Race Director whether it is appropriate to implement it or not. The fans (if they're watching the race on TV) and drivers can hear the Race Director declare the FCY (mainly saying \\"Attention all teams, attention all teams this is Race Control, Full Course Yellow in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Full Course Yellow, Full Course Yellow). Once the FCY is implemented, all drivers must activate the FCY limiter, which, similar to the pit speed limiter, keeps the car under FCY speeds despite the throttle being flat to the floor. For season 6 of Formula E, when there is an FCY period, everyone is no longer allowed to activate Attack Mode. For every minute spent under FCY conditions, 1kWh of energy kept in reserve by the drivers will be subtracted, giving more energy saving tactics to the drivers and teams alike. Like Formula One, Formula E does have a safety car condition, but instead of a Mercedes-AMG GT R as the safety car, since 2014, a BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports car is used. Indianapolis 500 Chevrolet Camaro Z28, pace car in the 1993 Indianapolis 500 The first use of a pace car in automobile racing was at the inaugural Indy 500 in 1911. The officials at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway have been selecting a pace car and its driver for the Indy 500 each year since that first race. The first pace car was a Stoddard-Dayton driven by Carl G. Fisher. In recent years Chevrolet models have been chosen as the official pace car, owing to the ability for them to be used at both major automobile races at the Speedway (typically Corvette at the 500 and Impala at the 400). The pace car is selected two months before the race runs, allowing the manufacturer of the selected pace car to produce replicas of that year's car, which sell at a marked premium to collectors and race fans. Pace car replicas are often seen on the streets of Indianapolis weeks before the race is actually held, and a celebrity driver is usually used for the start of the race only. The Indiana Pacers, a professional basketball team located in Indianapolis, Indiana, is named after a pace car. The legacy of racing and the rich history of the Indy 500 both played a major role in the naming process. Automakers compete for the prestige of having one of their models selected as the year's pace car for the publicity. In 1971, the move backfired as no automakers stepped up to provide a pace car. Instead, local Indianapolis-area Dodge dealers fulfilled the duty. Eldon Palmer, a local dealer, lost control of the Dodge Challenger pace car and crashed into a photography stand, injuring several people. The blame for the crash was never fully determined, as officials realized that an orange cone (or perhaps an orange flag), which was to identify Palmer's braking point, was accidentally removed. In the last 50 years, the Pontiac Trans Am, Chevrolet Camaro, Chevrolet Corvette, Oldsmobile Cutlass, and Ford Mustang are the only models that have been selected as pace cars three or more times. The pace car leads the field past an accident site at the 2007 Indianapolis 500. During the IndyCar Series season, however, Johnny Rutherford is the normal driver of the IRL pace car for all events. The pace car is deployed for debris, collision, or weather reasons. Since 1993, upon the waving of the yellow flag, pit road is closed until the pace car picks up the leader and passes the pit entrance the first time, unless track blockage forces the field to drive through pit lane. Another duty of the pace car is to lead the field around the course on parade laps prior to the start of the race. These increase in speed, allowing for a flying start of the race. Furthermore, two other rule changes have been implemented. Since 2000, with one lap to go before going back to green, the pace car pulls off the track in turn one rather than in turn four. The current leader of the race is then assigned the task of pacing the field back to the green flag. After much consideration, this rule was added to prevent a situation much like the one that happened in the 1995 Indianapolis 500, when Scott Goodyear passed the pace car going back to green. In 2002, another rule was added. With one lap to go before the green, the pace car waves by all cars (if there are any) between the pace car and the actual leader of the race. This allows for the leader to control the restart without lapped cars being in front of him. It also creates a strategy for cars to gain laps back, loosely resembling the \\"Lucky dog\\" rule. However, the cars who get waved around are not allowed to pit until the green flag restarts the race (so they do not get the advantage of getting their lap back AND a free pit stop). NASCAR 2001 Winston Cup (now NASCAR Cup Series) pace car ‚Äì a modified 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP coupe In all NASCAR series, if the caution is out for debris, accident, or inclement weather, the flagman will display the yellow caution flag and the pace car will pull out of the pits and turn on the yellow strobes on top and/or behind the car. When race officials are ready to open pit lane, a green light will come on in the rear window of the safety car. One lap before a green flag, the pace car will shut off its lights to signal drivers to line up double file. Unlike most series in motorsport, owing to NASCAR's short-track roots, each track usually offers its own safety car, typically from the manufacturer, but in recent years, it has been a local dealer or association of regional dealerships-provided Safety car. Tracks that use Toyota safety cars will use a Toyota Camry Hybrid, while Ford tracks will use a Ford Mustang, while Chevrolet tracks use a Chevrolet Camaro and most Dodge tracks use a Dodge Challenger. If a manufacturer is promoting a new vehicle, they will often use the new car instead of the standard-specification safety car. For the Truck Series, which races pickup trucks instead of cars, the safety \\"car\\" is often a pickup. Tracks affiliated with a local or regional Chevrolet dealership will use a Chevrolet Silverado, while Chrysler dealership-affiliated tracks will use a Ram 1500. Ford- affiliated tracks will often use the F-Series, but Toyota-affiliated tracks are less likely to use the Toyota Tundra, but prefer marketing the Camry Hybrid. However, Ford and Toyota manufacturer sponsored tracks will prefer the Mustang and Camry, respectively, instead of a truck, and occasionally, pickup trucks have been used as pace vehicles for Cup Series and Xfinity races. Since NASCAR does not allow speedometers or electronic speed limiting devices, the pace car circles the track at pit road speed during the warm-up laps. This allows each driver to note the RPM at which pit road speed is maintained. Drivers exceeding that speed on pit road will be penalized, typically a \\"drive-through\\" or \\"stop and go\\" penalty, costing them valuable track position. The pace car for the 2011 Daytona 500, a Chevrolet Camaro. Since mid-2004, NASCAR official Brett Bodine has driven the vehicle during official race functions during Cup Series races. Other famous NASCAR pace car drivers include Robert \\"Buster\\" Auton and Elmo Langley. At many races, NASCAR has an honorary pace car driver that actually drives a car during the parade laps. Depending on the driver's skill, some drivers are allowed to pace the field right up to the dropping of the green flag. Some famous drivers have been Jay Leno, Richard Hammond, Luke Wilson, Rob Gronkowski, Guy Fieri and many others. The beneficiary rule (informally known as the \\"lucky dog\\" rule) states once the safety car is deployed, the first car not on the lead lap will regain a lap. The Beneficiary will regain his lap once pit road opens. Bodine will signal that car to pass him through radio contact between NASCAR and that team. The free pass car must pit with the lapped cars. In 2009, NASCAR introduced a new \\"Double-file restart\\" rule that lines the field two cars on each row on every restart, similar to the start of the race, instead of lead- lap cars on the outside and lapped cars on the inside. Also, the \\"wave-around\\" rule, similar to what is enforced in racing series sanctioned by IndyCar, was adopted to ensure the first car on the restart is the leader, and ensure there are no lapped cars ahead of the leader. Incidents with safety cars and other course cars=2014 Sprint Unlimited Before the start of the final segment of the Sprint Cup Series' Sprint Unlimited exhibition race at Daytona, the Chevrolet SS pace car caught fire and stopped off the track, delaying the restart. The fire was believed to have started in a trunk-mounted battery pack powering the lights. 2012 Daytona 500 During a safety car situation on Lap 160 of the 2012 Daytona 500, Earnhardt Ganassi Racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya's car had a suspension part failure, and it lost control on turn 3, sharply veering right into a safety truck and jet dryer trailer, causing a massive diesel/jet fuel fire. As it was seen on video, sparks were seen emanating from Montoya's car right before its hard collision with the jet dryer trailer and left driver's side of the truck. Montoya was treated at the infield care center and released. Montoya's report over the radio after the incident was \\"I left the pits and felt a really weird vibration and I came back in and checked the rear end and said it was okay and I got into the backstraight and we were are going fourth gear but wasn't going that fast. Every time I got on the gas I could feel the rear squeezing. When I was telling the spotter to have a look how the rear was moving the car just turned right.\\" The driver of the Chevrolet Silverado Crew Cab, Duane Barnes, was taken to a local hospital for observation and was resting comfortably. He was an employee at Michigan International Speedway, a sister track of Daytona. The tracks often share jet dryer equipment on race weekends to help in case of rain such as the case on Sunday, the original scheduled start time of the race. The entire incident took about two hours to clean up before the last 40 (later extended to 42 due to a Green-white-checkered finish) laps were able to be completed. NASCAR subsequently added the use of the second safety car (used during race start situations) to protect the last jet dryer in other safety car situations. 2011 6 Hours of Castellet The 2011 6 Hours of Castellet got off to a controversial start when the pace car did not return to the pits when the green lights came on. The front running LMPs slowed down but some of the GT cars could not react fast enough, resulting in heavy damage to all three GTE Pro class Porsches which caused them to retire. The GTE Am class IMSA Performance Matmut Porsche and GTE Pro JOTA Aston Martin were also caught up in the carnage. 2009 WTCC Pau An accident occurred during the 2009 FIA WTCC Race of France in Pau, France. A succession of first-lap accidents caused the safety car to be placed on standby, with yellow flags waving on the start-finish section of the track. The safety car driver then proceeded to drive onto the track at slow speed, without official approval, moving across the pit exit line immediately after exiting the pits, instead of confining to the inside of it until the line ended. Race leader Franz Engstler came through the kink on the start-finish straight and was unable to avoid hitting the side of the pace car. Engstler commented \\"I saw the safety car coming out from the right and realized that I had no chance to brake... I really do not understand why he was going out of the pits\\". After this incident, the Portuguese Bruno Correia was appointed as the official safety car driver. 2008 Dutch Supercar Challenge Spa A safety car caused a crash during the 2008 Dutch Supercar Challenge race at Spa Francorchamps. The Seat Leon was released too late, allowing the leading Marcos LM600 to pass while erroneously identifying the Audi TT DTM in 2nd and Mosler MT900R GT3 in 3rd as 'the leading pack.' Race officials immediately realized their mistake, and the safety car was instructed to slow down and let the entire field pass. As the safety car was exiting turn 11, an approaching Lamborghini Gallardo GT3 drastically reduced its speed in response to the unusually slow safety car. However, a BMW a few seconds behind came around the blind turn at speed, colliding with the Gallardo and safety car. The collision destroyed the Gallardo and sent the BMW into a number of rolls. The safety car was sent off the track into the Armco safety barrier at great speed. In the chaos, a Marcos LM600 coming around turn 11 locked up its brakes and spun into the wet grass on the inside of the track. Sliding back onto the track, it was hit from the side by a BMW Z3. Furthermore, two E46 BMW M3 GTRs were damaged: one on the outside line hit the rear of the Marcos, and the other, on the inside line, slightly damaged its front right. The second M3 continued around the track, while the first slid into the grass before turn 12. The race was stopped, and there were no serious injuries to any of the drivers. 1971 Indianapolis 500 The pace car of the 1971 Indianapolis 500, an orange Dodge Challenger driven by local auto dealer Eldon Palmer, crashed at the start of the race. As Palmer drove the car off into the pit lane to let the race cars begin the race, he lost control of the car and crashed into a photographer stand. There were no fatalities, and the number of people reported injured has ranged from 18 to 29.

Legal definition Nunc pro tunc may apply to \\"a judgment is entered, or document enrolled, so as to have the same legal force and effect as if it had been entered or enrolled on an earlier day\\". quoted in at p. 131. This type of order originated from the Court of Chancery from 1388. at pp. 131-132 per Toohey J.

Nunc pro tunc may also apply to acts that are allowed to be done after the time legally allotted to carry them out has passed. For example, in the probate of an estate, if real property, such as lands, mineral interests, etc., are discovered after the final decree or order, a nunc pro tunc order can include these discovered lands or assets into the estate and clarify how they were meant to be distributed. Or, when a court clerk makes a clerical error or a mistake on the public record without any legal authority to do so, without a judicial order, or without obtaining consent by the parties involved. A Nunc Pro Tunc corrects the record to accurately reflect judicial proceedings and agreements reached between parties. http://www.lacourt.org/forms/pdf/PRO028.pdf Corporate application A corporation may have been created by an individual, but since a corporation, in the United States, has the standing in law of a person (although not a natural person), it is possible for its human creator to go bankrupt and for the assets of the corporation to be seized to satisfy unpaid taxes. If someone buys those assets from the tax authority and the corporation shell passed into other hands, it is possible for the person who bought the assets to also buy the corporation shell and, after paying corporate franchise taxes, for that person to claim that the corporation is nunc pro tunc the original corporation with the original assets. Internal Revenue Service Some taxpayers file returns or other documents with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that have the phrase \\"nunc pro tunc\\" stamped or written on the face of the return or document. These taxpayers assert that the phrase \\"nunc pro tunc\\" has some legal effect in reducing, eliminating, or altering in some way their federal income tax liability or other obligations under the tax laws. According to the IRS, this is considered a \\"frivolous\\" argument and is subject to $5,000 fine. Inserting the phrase \\"nunc pro tunc\\" or similar arguments on a return or other document submitted to the Service has no legal effect. Litigation A judgment nunc pro tunc is an action by a trial court correcting a clerical (rather than judicial) error in a prior judgment. A nunc pro tunc may be signed even after the trial court loses its plenary power. For appellate purposes, a nunc pro tunc judgment correctly taken ordinarily does not extend appellate deadlines. Catholic Church In the Catholic Church, a bishop's resignation is often accepted by the Holy See nunc pro tunc, which means it is tentatively accepted, but the Pope needs some time to locate and appoint a replacement for that diocese. The announcement of the new appointment is usually accompanied by actual acceptance of the outgoing bishop's resignation.

The Hollow Hope The Hollow Hope challenges the widely held belief that the U.S. Supreme Court is an effective agent of social change. Rosenberg builds an argument that the Supreme Court is structurally constrained from producing social change even when social change plaintiffs win their cases. Focusing on famous Supreme Court cases, particularly Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v.

Lounge singer Richard Cheese is a character created and portrayed by Los Angeles-based actor/comedian/singer Mark Jonathan Davis. History Davis developed the Richard Cheese lounge singer idea in the mid-1990s while working as a producer at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. Davis portrayed a character named \\"Paul the 55-Year-Old Intern\\" on the Kevin and Bean morning show, and Paul recorded a single called \\"Paul on 45\\", which was a humorous medley of KROQ songs arranged in a swing/big band style. Davis pitched this idea as an album concept, and the band's debut album Richard Cheese: Lounge Against the Machine (\\"Featuring 16 Swingin' Covers of Alternative Standards\\") was released in 2000 by Oglio Records. Since 2000, Davis's Richard Cheese & Lounge Against the Machine band has released twenty albums. Cheese's second and third albums Tuxicity and I'd Like a Virgin were independently released in 2002 and 2004 by Cheese's own label, Ideatown Entertainment (later renamed to Coverage Records). From 2004‚Äì2006, Surfdog Records released three new Richard Cheese CDs: Aperitif for Destruction, an all-new studio album, Silent Nightclub, a collection of songs tangentially related to the holiday season, and The Sunny Side of the Moon: The Best of Richard Cheese, which included newly re-recorded versions of six Richard Cheese classics plus three all-new covers. Surfdog also re-released the Richard Cheese albums Tuxicity and I'd Like a Virgin on their label in 2006. Beginning in 2007, Cheese returned to releasing his own albums through his independent Coverage Records label, about one each year: Dick at Nite, Viva La Vodka: Richard Cheese Live, OK Bartender, A Lounge Supreme, Live at the Royal Wedding and its companion behind-the-scenes album The Royal Baby Album, Back in Black Tie, and a Christmas album, Cocktails with Santa. Cheese also produced an album in 2010 as Johnny Aloha called Lavapalooza, with a band of Hawaiian music musicians performing tiki-style versions of rock and rap songs. The album cover artwork was created by the artist Shag. In late 2015, Cheese released 3 new CDs: a live album titled Bakin' at the Boulder, a Star Wars tribute called The Lounge Awakens: Richard Cheese & Lounge Against the Machine Live at the Mos Eisley Spaceport Cantina, and a new studio album Supermassive Black Tux. In 2016, because Richard Cheese sang two songs in the motion picture Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the band released a one- track parody album called Richard Cheese: Live at Wayne Financial Tower in which the band's performance is cut short by Superman's heat vision. The Richard Cheese & Lounge Against the Machine band released a new studio album on CD titled Licensed to Spill in 2017, and a greatest hits digital compilation titled Lord of the Swings: The Best of Richard Cheese, Volume 2 in 2018. In 2019, the band released Richard Cheese's Big Swingin' Organ, an album of instrumental organ versions of 9 of his songs. Also in 2019, Richard Cheese released a one-track parody album titled Richard Cheese: Live on Titan which satirized the ending of the motion picture Avengers: Infinity War. A new studio album titled Numbers Of The Beast was released on July 31, 2020. The Richard Cheese & Lounge Against the Machine band has toured extensively around the United States, and has played shows in England, Portugal, The Bahamas, and Canada. The band is currently headlining regularly at Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas. Richard Cheese's cover of Disturbed's \\"Down with the Sickness\\" was featured in the 2004 Zack Snyder-directed remake of Dawn of the Dead. Snyder also included Richard Cheese songs in his 2016 Warner Bros. film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Warner Bros. then hired the band to perform and appear as animated LEGO mini-figs in the 2017 film The Lego Batman Movie, singing the song \\"Man in the Mirror\\" and performing an \\"elevator-music\\" version of \\"Everything Is Awesome\\". Richard Cheese has made numerous television appearances, including performances on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ for New Year's Eve, ESPN for a Las Vegas March Madness broadcast, Fox & Friends on Fox News Channel, ITV's The Jonathan Ross Show in England, and as the Vegas house band on NBC's Last Call with Carson Daly and MTV's Say What? Karaoke series. Richard Cheese & Lounge Against the Machine songs have been featured on ABC's Dancing with the Stars, NBC's Las Vegas series, and NBC's Passions soap opera. In April 2017, the band's swing cover of Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\" was featured in the opening credits of \\"Crazy Whitefella Thinking,\\" an episode of HBO's The Leftovers series. Richard Cheese has also been featured on radio morning shows and syndicated radio programs such as The Dr. Demento Show, KROQ-FM's Kevin and Bean, Jonathon Brandmeier, The Howard Stern Show, Opie and Anthony, The Bob and Sheri Show, The Adam Carolla Show, and Gonzo in the Morning. Davis is currently writing an autobiography about the band, titled Atlas Lounged: The Music, Movies, and Madness Behind Richard Cheese & Lounge Against the Machine which is expected to be released in 2021. Band members The present line-up of the Lounge Against the Machine band consists of: * Richard Cheese ‚Äì vocals * Bobby Ricotta ‚Äì piano, keyboards * Frank Feta ‚Äì drums, percussion * Billy Bleu ‚Äì upright bass, bass The names are all pseudonyms that refer to types of cheese (ricotta, feta, bleu).

He also served as the head of operations for NASCAR and president of the Riverside International Raceway. Richter was twice a consensus All-American for the California Golden Bears football team of the University of California. With the Rams, he played in eight Pro Bowls. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011. Football career Richter in 1959 At the University of California, Richter played guard and linebacker for the California Golden Bears football team. He was twice recognized as a consensus All-American and first-team All-Pacific Coast, in 1950 and 1951. He was valedictorian of his graduating class of 1952. After graduation, he served in the Korean War for the U.S. Army for two years. He was a first-round draft choice of the NFL's New York Yanks, the second pick overall, in the 1952 NFL Draft. The Yanks folded before the 1952 season, and the Dallas Texans assumed the rights to Richter. They traded him to the Los Angeles Rams for eleven players, the second largest deal ever made for a single player. During his nine years with the Rams, Richter did not miss a game, playing through various injuries including a broken cheekbone. He scored 193 points, which included a touchdown, 106 extra points, and 29 field goals. On defense, he intercepted 16 passes. His 24 field goals attempted during the 1955 season led the NFL. The Rams struggled during that time, winning six or more games four times in nine seasons. The high mark for the team was in 1955, when it reached the championship game and lost to the Cleveland Browns. Richter was selected to eight straight Pro Bowls, from 1954 to 1961, and was four times recognized as a first-team All-Pro. He played center for his final season, in 1962, taking over for injured starter Art Hunter. Racing executive and later years After retiring from football, Richter was involved with auto racing in a variety of positions. He was Riverside International Raceway manager from 1959 to 1983, then vice-president of special projects for International Speedway Corporation, chairman of the board for the International Race of Champions, and senior vice president of operations for NASCAR.Former Riverside Raceway boss Richter honored - Road Racing World, 3 February 2004 Richter died on June 12, 2010, at age 79 of a brain aneurysm. As a lieutenant with the U.S. Army during the Korean War, Richter was buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. At the time of his death, Richter was working at the Auto Club Speedway, owned by a sister company to ISC. Richter was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982. In 2011, he was posthumously elected as a senior candidate to the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2011 along with former Washington Redskins linebacker Chris Hanburger. The induction class also included Deion Sanders, Richard Dent, Marshall Faulk, Ed Sabol, Shannon Sharpe.

The final design was capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the USSR from bases in the US, while cruising at at altitude. The missile is named after the Navajo Nation. The original 1946 project called for a relatively short-range system, a boost-glide weapon based on a winged V-2 rocket design. Over time the requirements were repeatedly extended, both due to the US Air Force's desire for longer ranged systems, as well as competition from similar weapons that successfully filled the shorter-range niche. This led to a new design based on a ramjet powered cruise missile, which also developed into a series of ever-larger versions, along with the booster rockets to launch them up to speed. Through this period the US Air Force was developing the SM-65 Atlas, based on rocket technology developed for Navaho. Atlas filled the same performance goals but could do so with total flight times measured in minutes rather than hours, and flying at speeds and altitudes which made them immune to interception, as opposed to merely very difficult to intercept as in the case of Navaho. With the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and the ensuing fears of a missile gap, Atlas received the highest development authority. Navaho continued as a backup, before being canceled in 1958 when Atlas successfully matured. Although Navaho did not enter service, its development provided useful research in a number of fields. A version of the Navaho airframe powered by a single turbojet became the AGM-28 Hound Dog, which was carried towards its targets on the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress and then flew the rest of the way at about Mach 2. The guidance system was used to guide the first Polaris submarines. The booster engine design, spun off to NAA's new Rocketdyne subsidiary, was used in various versions of the Atlas, PGM-11 Redstone, PGM-17 Thor, PGM-19 Jupiter, Mercury-Redstone, and the Juno series; it is therefore the direct ancestor of the engines used to launch the Saturn I and Saturn V moon rockets. Development=Postwar Army missile studies The V-1 inspired a range of US Army Air Force missile designs. The Germans had introduced a number of new \\"wonder weapons\\" during the war that were of great interest to all the allied forces. Jet engines were already widely used after their introduction in the UK, but the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket represented technologies that had not been developed elsewhere. In German use these weapons had relatively little strategic effect and had to be fired in the thousands to cause any real damage. But if armed with a nuclear weapon, even a single such weapon would cause damage equivalent to thousands of conventionally armed versions, and this line of research was quickly taken up by the US Army Air Force (USAAF) in late 1944. Vannevar Bush of the USAAF's Scientific Advisory Board was convinced that manned or automated aircraft like the V-1 were the only possible solution for long range roles. A ballistic missile capable of carrying even the smallest warhead was \\"at least ten years away\\", and when asked directly about the topic, noted: Army planners began planning for a wide variety of post-war missile systems that varied from short-range ballistic missiles to long range flying bombs. After considerable internal debate among Army branches, in August 1945 these were codified in a classified document outlining many such systems, among them a variety of nuclear-armed cruise missiles, essentially V-1s with extended range and the greater payload needed to carry a nuclear warhead. There were three broad outlines depending on range, one for a missile flying , another , and finally one for . Both subsonic and supersonic designs would be considered. Competing designs The various proposals were sent to seventeen aviation firms on 31 October 1945. Of the many proposals received, six companies were granted development contracts. Submissions for the longer-range requirements were all based on cruise missile designs, while the shorter-range examples were a mixture of designs. These were assigned designations in keeping with the USAAF's Experimental Engineering Section's \\"MX\\" series. NAA chief designer, Dutch Kindelberger, was convinced missiles were the future, and hired William Bollay from the US Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics to run their newly formed research laboratory. Bollay had previously run the Navy's turbojet development. Bollay arrived to find the Army proposals, and decided to submit a short-range design based on a winged ballistic missile based on the German A-4b design (sometimes known as the A-9), a development of the basic V-2. On 24 March 1946, NAA received letter contract W33-038-ac-1491 for this missile, designated MX-770. The initial design called for a range of with a payload, but on 26 July this was increased to . A number of other designs were also accepted, but these were all cruise missile designs to fill the longer range requirements. These were Martin's MX-771-A for a subsonic missile and -B for a supersonic version, MX-772-A and -B from Curtiss-Wright, MX-773-A and -B from Republic Aircraft, and MX-775-A and -B from Northrop. It was intended that one subsonic and one supersonic design would be put into production, and these were granted the designations SSM-A-1 and SSM-A-2, respectively. The only ballistic missile in the group, MX-774, went to Consolidated-Vultee. When President Harry S. Truman ordered a massive cut in military spending for FY1947, as part of the Truman Doctrine, the USAAF was forced to make major cuts to their missile development program. Missile funding was cut from $29million to $13million (from $million to $million in today's dollars). In what became known as \\"the black Christmas of 1946\\", many of the original projects were cancelled, with the remaining companies working on a single design instead of two. Only Martin continued development of a subsonic design, their MX-771-A, delivering the first SSM-A-1 Matador in 1949. The rest of the companies were told to work only on supersonic designs. Engine work NAA began experimenting with rocket engines in 1946, firing the rockets in the company parking lot and protecting the cars by parking a bulldozer in front of the engines. They first used a design from Aerojet, and then designed their own model of . But by the spring of 1946, captured German data was being disseminated around the industry, and in June 1946 the team decided to abandon their own designs and build a new engine based on the V-2's Model 39. In late 1946 two Model 39 engines were sent to NAA for study, where they were referred to as the XLR-41 Mark I. The \\"XLR\\" referred to \\"eXperimental Liquid Rocket\\", a new designation system being used by the Army Air Force. They used these as the basis for a conversion from metric to SAE measurements and US construction techniques, which they called the Mark II. During this period, the company received a number of late-war reports on developments of a Model 39a engine for the V-2, which replaced the original model's eighteen separate fuel injectors with a single \\"shower head\\" plate inside a single larger combustion chamber. This not only simplified the design, it made it lighter and improved performance. The Germans were never able to get this working due to combustion instability and continued using the earlier design in spite of lower performance. The team that had designed the engine was now in the United States after being captured as part of Operation Paperclip. Many of them were setting up a new Army-funded research effort under the direction of Wernher von Braun. The company hired Dieter Huzel to act as a coordinator between NAA and the Army missile team. In September 1947, the company began design of an engine incorporating the showerhead design, which they called the Mark III. Initially the goal was to match the thrust of the Model 39, but be 15% lighter. Work on the Mark II continued and the detailed design was completed in June 1947. In March, the company rented a large tract of land in the western San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles, in the Santa Susana Mountains, for use in testing of large engines. A rocket test center was built here, using $1 million (equivalent to $ million today) of corporate funds and $1.5 million ($ million today) from the USAAF. The first parts began to arrive in September. Development of the Mark III proceeded in parallel using a scaled-down version developing that could be fired in the parking lot. The team made a string of changes to this and eventually cured the combustion problems. Evolving design Another set of German research papers received by NAA concerned work on supersonic ramjets, which appeared to make a highly supersonic cruise missile design possible. Bollay began a series of parallel design projects; Phase 1 was the original boost-glide design, Phase 2 was a design that used ramjets, and Phase 3 was a study for what sort of booster rocket would be needed to get the Phase 2 vehicle up to speed from a vertical launch system. Meanwhile, aerodynamicists in the company discovered that the A-4b's swept wing design was inherently unstable at transonic speeds. They redesigned the missile with a delta wing at the extreme rear, and canards at the nose. Engineers working on the inertial navigation system (INS) invented an entirely new design known as the Kinetic Double-Integrating Accelerometer (KDIA) that measured not only velocity as in the V-2's version, but then integrated that to provide the location as well. This meant that the autopilot simply had to compare the target location with the current location from the INS to develop a correction, if any, that needed to bring the missile back on target. So, by June 1947, the original A-4b design had been changed at every point; the engine, airframe and navigation systems were now all new. New concept In September 1947 the US Air Force was split off from the US Army. As part of the split, the forces agreed to divide ongoing development projects based on range, with the Army taking all the projects with a range of or less, and the Air Force everything above that. MX-770 was well below that limit, but instead of handing it over to the Army's Ordnance Department who were working with von Braun on ballistic missiles, in February 1948 the Air Force instead requested that NAA double the range of the MX-770 to put it into the Air Force's domain. Examining the work to date, NAA abandoned the boost-glide concept and moved to the ramjet powered cruise missile as the primary design. Even with the more efficient propulsion offered by the ramjets, the missile would have to be 33% larger to reach the required range. This, in turn, demanded a more powerful booster engine to power the launcher, so the requirement for the XLR-41 Mark III was raised to . However, the N-1 INS system drifted at a rate of 1 mile per hour, so at its maximum range it would not be able to meet the Air Force's CEP. The company began development of the N-2 to fill this need and provide considerable headroom if greater range was requested. It was essentially the mechanism of the N-1 paired to a star tracker which would provide midcourse updates to correct for any accumulated drift. The Air Force assigned the missile the XSSM-A-2 designation, and then outlined a three-stage development plan. For Phase 1, the existing design would be used for technology development and as a testbed for various launch concepts, including the original booster concept, as well as rocket-track launches and air dropped versions. Phase 2 would extend the range of the missile to , and Phase 3 would further increase that to an intercontinental while carrying a heavier warhead. The design evolution finally ended in July 1950 with the Air Force of Weapon System 104A specifications. Under this new requirement the purpose of the program was the development of a range nuclear missile. WS-104A Under WS-104A, the Navaho program was broken up into three guided missile efforts. The first of these missiles was the North American X-10, a flying subrange vehicle to prove the general aerodynamics, guidance, and control technologies for vehicles two and three. The X-10 was essentially an unmanned high performance jet, powered by two afterburning Westinghouse J40 turbojets and equipped with retractable landing gear for take off and landing. It was capable of speeds up to Mach 2 and could fly almost . Its success at Edwards AFB and then at Cape Canaveral set the stage for the development of the second vehicle: XSSM-A-4, Navaho II, or G-26. Step two, the G-26, was a nearly full-size Navaho nuclear vehicle. Launched vertically by a liquid-fuel rocket booster, the G-26 would rocket upward until it had reached a speed of approximately Mach 3 and an altitude of . At this point the booster would be expended and the vehicle's ramjets ignited to power the vehicle to its target. The G-26 made a total of 10 launches from Launch Complex 9 (LC-9) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) between 1956 and 1957. Launch Complex 10 (LC-10) was also assigned to the Navaho program, but no G-26s were ever launched from it (it was only used for ground tests of the planned portable launcher). The dual-engine of the SM-64 Navaho at the Udvar-Hazy Center. The final operational version, the G-38 or XSM-64A, was the same basic design as the G-26 only larger. It incorporated numerous new technologies, Titanium components, gimballed rocket engines, a Kerosene/LOX propellant combination, and full solid-state electronic controls. None were ever flown, the program being cancelled before the first example was completed. The advanced rocket booster technology went on to be used in other missiles including the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile and the inertial guidance system was later used as the guidance system on the first U.S. nuclear-powered submarines. Development of the first-stage rocket engine for the Navaho began with two refurbished V-2 engines in 1947. That same year, the phase II engine was designed, the XLR-41-NA-1, a simplified version of the V-2 engine made from American parts. The phase III engine, XLR-43-NA-1 (also called 75K), adopted a cylindrical combustion chamber with the experimental German impinging-stream injector plate. Engineers at North American were able to solve the combustion stability problem, which had prevented it being used in the V-2, and the engine was successfully tested at full power in 1951. The Phase IV engine, XLR-43-NA-3 (120K), replaced the poorly cooled heavy German engine wall with a brazed tubular (\\"spaghetti\\") construction, which was becoming the new standard method for regenerative cooling in American engines. A dual-engine version of this, XLR-71-NA-1 (240K), was used in the G-26 Navaho. With improved cooling, a more powerful kerosene-burning version was developed for the triple-engine XLR-83-NA-1 (405K), used in the G-38 Navaho. With all the elements of a modern engine (except a bell-shaped nozzle), this led to designs for the Atlas, Thor and Titan engines. Operational history The first launch attempt, on 6 November 1956, failed after 26 seconds of flight. Ten failed launches followed, before another got off successfully, on 22 March 1957, for 4 minutes, 39 seconds of flight. A 25 April attempt exploded seconds after liftoff, while a 26 June flight lasted only 4 minutes, 29 seconds.Werrell 1998, p. 98. Officially, the program was canceled on 13 July 1957, after the first four launches ended in failure. In reality the program was obsolete by mid-1957 as the first Atlas ICBM began flight tests in June and the Jupiter and Thor IRBMs were showing great promise. These ballistic missiles however would not have been possible without the liquid fuel rocket engine developments accomplished in the Navaho program. The launch of the Soviet Satellite Sputnik in October 1957 only finished Navaho as the Air Force shifted its research money into ICBMs. But the technologies developed for the Navaho were reused in 1957 for the development of the AGM-28 Hound Dog, a nuclear cruise missile which entered in production in 1959. The Soviet Union had been working on parallel projects, The Myasishchev RSS-40 \\"Buran\\" and Lavochkin \\"Burya\\" and a little later, the Tupolev Tu-123. The first two types were also large rocket-boosted ramjets, while the third was a turbojet-powered machine. With the cancellation of the Navaho and the promise of ICBMs in the strategic missile role, the first two were canceled as well, though the Lavochkin project, which had some successful test flights, was carried on for research and development purposes, and the Tupolev was reworked as a big, fast reconnaissance drone. Operators * : The United States Air Force canceled the program before accepting the Navaho into service. Survivors CCAFS, Florida The remaining X-10 is on display at the United States Air Force Museum Annex at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. A Navaho booster rocket, though not marked as such, is currently displayed in front of a VFW post in Fort McCoy, Florida. One Navaho missile was previously displayed outside the south entrance gate of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. This survivor was destroyed by Hurricane Matthew on 7 October 2016.

Known by the nickname \\"Kjakan\\" (\\"The Cheeks\\") and as \\"Agent No. 24\\", he was the most highly decorated citizen in Norway, including being the only person to have been awarded the War Cross with three swords, Norway's highest military decoration.Gunnar S√∏nsteby, obituary, Daily Telegraph, 10 May 2012. Retrieved 2013-02-26.  Early life and education  Born in Rjukan, in Telemark, he was the son of Margit and Gustav S√∏nsteby. As a boy he enjoyed walking in the mountains around Rjukan with his school friends, many of whom later became members of the Resistance alongside him. He attended what is now Rjukan videreg√•ende skole, earning an examen atrium. Among the members of his graduating class in 1937 were later Resistance fighters such as Knut Haugland, Halvor Rivrud, Olav Skogen, Leif Nilsen, Rolf Solem, Turjus Aarnes, Knut Berge, and Einar Nordgaard. After graduating from gymnasium, he moved to Oslo, where he studied at Otto Treiders Business School. The next year he began studying social economy at the University of Oslo. While in Oslo he also carried out his obligatory military service and worked in a series of jobs. Second World War S√∏nsteby was working as an accountant when the Germans occupied Norway in 1940. Norway's regular armed forces surrendered on 10 June 1940, after two months of fighting, and the country was subsequently occupied by the Germans. He quickly joined the Norwegian Resistance forces in √òstlandet. He fought in Philip Hansteen's ski company. He was also involved in the underground press. In 1941 he was brought into the secret British military unit called Special Operations Executive (SOE) at their office in Stockholm. He became \\"Agent 24\\" in the SOE. While on assignment in Stockholm in 1942, he was interned and imprisoned for three months by Swedish police, but managed to convince them that he was not the same Gunnar S√∏nsteby for whom they were looking. Back in Norway in 1943, he was caught by the Gestapo but managed to escape and flee to Sweden. From there, he was sent to Britain, where in June of that year he enrolled in the Linge Company, which was formed to participate in British-led operations in Norway, to organise, instruct, and the lead the Norwegian Resistance Movement, to serve as a link between the home front and the outside world, and to perform intelligence work. In October, he parachuted into Norway and became a leader of the Milorg group. In that same month he also became head of the newly established Oslo Gang, a sabotage group, whose other members were Andreas Aubert, Viggo Axelsen, Gregers Gram, Henrik Hop, William Houlder, Max Manus, Martin Olsen, Arthur Pevik, Birger Rasmussen, Tor Stenersen, and Edvard Tallaksen. The British historian William Mackenzie called the Oslo Gang \\"the best group of saboteurs in Europe\\". After saboteur training in England in 1943, he became the contact for all SOE agents in eastern Norway and head of the Norwegian Independent Company 1 group in Oslo. This group performed several spectacular acts of sabotage; among them smuggling out plates for the printing of Norwegian kroner from the Norwegian Central Bank to the exiled government in London and blowing up the office for Norwegian forced labour, thereby stopping the Nazis' plan of sending young Norwegian men to the Eastern Front.Jensen, Finn Robert; Gunnar \\"Kjakan\\" S√∏nsteby Om samhold og innsatsvilje; Pantagruel forlag; Oslo; 2008 S√∏nsteby's gang also carried out the \\"Mardonius\\" action, blowing up several ships in Oslo harbour in April 1943. They also attacked Kongsberg munitions factory in September 1944, destroying guns and vital machine tools. In addition, they killed several leading figures in the Occupation Forces, including the Nazi head of police in Norway, Karl Marthinsen. Other actions included the theft of 75,000 ration books, which allowed pressure to be placed on authorities, stopping a threatened cut in rations; the destruction of sulphuric acid manufacturing facilities in Lysaker; destroying or seriously damaging over 40 aircraft, and related equipment which were being repaired at a tram company depot in Korsvoll; destroying a railway locomotive which was under repair at Skabo; destroying a number of Bofors guns, a field gun and vital machine tools at the Kongsberg arms factory; and starting a large fire in an oil storage depot at Oslo harbour which destroyed large quantities of oil and other specialist lubricants. After D-Day, S√∏nsteby concentrated largely on bombing Norwegian railways, thereby keeping German reinforcements from being moved back to the front line. His team also sank the German transport ship Donau outside Drobak in 1945. Operating in occupied territory, and being high on the Gestapo list of wanted men, S√∏nsteby became a master of disguise. He operated under 30 to 40 different names and identities, and the Germans did not acquire his real name until near the end of the war. They were never able to catch him. His obituary in Aftenposten attributed his ability to elude capture to \\"resourcefulness, luck, intuition,\\" and \\"such an entirely ordinary appearance that he was hardly noticed when he rode his bicycle through Oslo's streets.\\" S√∏nsteby himself explained his ability to get through the war without capture on his ability to carry out many of his actions himself and on his ability to arrange for his own ID papers. He had 20 to 30 places where he spent the night, many for only one night at a time, and never used any of them for more than a couple months. To avoid detection, he moved from flat to flat almost daily. One of his hideaways was above a bakery. \\"When I came to the baker's shop I always looked at the girl selling bread. If she gave a special face I would know the Germans were there. I would turn around,\\" S√∏nsteby later said. Aftenposten described him as having \\"nerves of steel\\" and he himself said that he had inherited a strong psychological makeup from his parents. \\"I was so cold,\\" he once said, \\"that some time I didn't react the way I should have.\\" During the last six months of the war he carried a hand grenade at all times, so that he could commit suicide if he was arrested. Not until the very end of the war, he explained, did he begin to experience anxiety. S√∏nsteby was a \\"master forger who could replicate the signature of Nazi police chief Karl Marthinsen.\\" As a punishment for S√∏nsteby's activities, his father was arrested by the Gestapo and held as a hostage for almost two years, from February 1943 to December 1944. Assassinations of informants When S√∏nsteby was 80 years old, he said \\"Of course wrong decisions were made, also by the Resistance Movement. But one must remember that war was going on. It did happen that we had to kill without being sure that the person concerned was an informant. But the decisions were correct‚Äîthere and then.\\" Post-war activities The Nazis withdrew from Norway on 8 May, and on 13 May S√∏nsteby led the cortege when Crown Prince Olav, the first member of the royal family to return from exile in London, arrived in Oslo. On 7 June, S√∏nsteby served as bodyguard for the Crown Prince and his family at the homecoming of the rest of the royal family, including King Haakon. After the liberation of Norway, he refused job offers from both the British and Norwegian intelligence services. \\"I didn't want any more war,\\" he explained. \\"I had had enough. I'd lost five years of my life.\\" Instead, in the autumn of 1945, S√∏nsteby moved to Boston, where he worked at a government purchasing center in New York and took part in an executive study program at Harvard Business School. He worked for Standard Oil (Esso). In 1949 he returned home to Norway, where he held several major positions in private business. Later, he also worked at the Norwegian Home Front Museum. Throughout the post war years and particularly after his retirement, S√∏nsteby gave many lectures in an effort to pass on the lessons of the Second World War to future generations. His credo, he said, was as follows: \\"As long as I live, I will tell the important facts. The historians can analyze, but I was there.\\" Harald Stanghelle wrote in 2018 that S√∏nsteby was for many years a \\"living war encyclopedia\\" who helped serve as \\"an effective political vaccine against all forms of fascism\\" and who, while \\"factually oriented and sober,\\" could get angry in debates at persons who tried to equate democracies with autocracies and had little patience for \\"historyless historians and ignorant journalists.\\" At the same time, he minimised his own personal contributions to the war effort, saying that the merchant marines had played a more significant role in Norway's fight against the Nazi occupiers. Two days before S√∏nsteby's death, Norwegian Financial Minister Sigbj√∏rn Johnsen unveiled a statue of S√∏nsteby at Rjukan torg and stated, \\"Gunnar S√∏nstebye is a great hero who risked his life so that we could win our freedom and our democracy\\".  Honours and Awards  Captain (Kaptein) S√∏nsteby is the only person awarded the War Cross with Three Swords (more properly known as \\"War Cross with sword and two swords\\"). All three awards were made in 1946.Aftenposten Newspaper: War hero turns 90 His additional recognitions include the following: * In 1945, S√∏nsteby was awarded the British Distinguished Service Order and the U.S. Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm. * In 2001 he was awarded the American-Scandinavian Foundation's culture award. * On 13 May 2007, a statue of him was erected on Solli plass in Oslo. The statue was sculpted by Per Ung and portrays a 25-year-old S√∏nsteby standing next to his bicycle.

After death A state funeral for S√∏nsteby was held on 25 May 2012 in Oslo Domkirke. Twenty-four soldiers from Hans Majestet Kongens Garde provided an honour guard, while the service was attended by the King of Norway, the Prime Minister of Norway, current and seven past Ministers of Defence, and the Chief of Defence. Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom was represented by a wreath. Several embassies to Norway were represented, including the United States Ambassador to Norway Barry B. White. The pallbearers were six officers, a break from the norm of using soldiers drafted from the King's Guard, and as they carried the coffin from the church, four Air Force F-16s performed a missing man flypast. A book of condolences at Armed Forces Museum in Oslo, was opened to the public on 11 May 2012.  Memorial fund  The establishment of a Gunnar S√∏nstebye Memorial Fund was discussed a half year before his death. The Fund was created with donations from Erling Lorentzen, Hans Hermann Horn, and the Inge Steensland Foundation. The Fund presents an annual memorial prize, the Gunnar S√∏nsteby Prize, consisting of a sum of money and a miniature of Per Ung's statue of S√∏nstebye in Studenterlunden. The prize was first awarded on 5 January 2012. The winners have included Per Edgar Kokkvold and Kristin Solberg (2015), Deeyah Khan and Trond Bakkevig (2016), and ten Norwegian veterans (2017).

Its design is typical of commercially available flare guns. A single-shot, 26.5/25mm flare gun manufactured by Patel Ballistics. It is chambered in a different caliber from the Orion flare gun. A flare gun, also known as a Very pistol or signal pistol, is a large- bore handgun that discharges flares. The flare gun is used to create illumination for improved vision or as a distress signal. A flare gun can be used as a deadly weapon; however, that is not its intended function.  Types  The most common type of flare gun is a Very (sometimes spelled Verey), which was named after Edward Wilson Very (1847‚Äì1910), an American naval officer who developed and popularized a single-shot breech-loading snub-nosed pistol that fired flares (Very lights). They have a single action trigger mechanism, hammer action, and a center fire pin.Julio S.

British 1\\" calibre Very pistol of World War I The older type of Very pistol, typical of the type used in the Second World War, are of one inch bore (26.5mm), now known as \\"Calibre 4\\" for signal pistols. These are still available and more recent longer barrel models can also fire parachute flares.Pains Wessex catalogue showing modern 26.5mm flare gun and both parachute flares (maroons) and conventional flare cartridges, accessed July 2012 Many newer models fire smaller 12-gauge flares. In countries where possession of firearms is strictly controlled, such as the United Kingdom, the use of Very pistols as emergency equipment on boats is less common than, for example, the United States. In such locations, distress flares are more commonly fired from single-shot tube devices which are then disposed of after use. These devices are fired by twisting or striking a pad on one end, but the contents are otherwise similar to a round from a flare gun, although the flares themselves are much larger and can burn brighter for longer.. In the Russian Federation, which also has strict controls on firearms, a special tube-shaped flare launching device called a \\"Hunter's Signal\\" (–°–∏–≥–Ω–∞–ª –û—Ö–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞) is available. This is reusable but is deliberately designed in a way to avoid resemblance to a gun. Flare guns may be used whenever someone needs to send a distress signal. The flares must be shot directly above, making the signal visible for a longer period of time and revealing the position of whoever is in need of assistance. There are four distinct flare calibers: 12ga, 25mm, 26.5mm, and 37mmthe first three being the most popular for boaters.  Use as weapons  A Molins No.2 Mk.5, 1-inch calibre Very pistol, , made by Berridge Ltd. While not intended as a weapon, flare guns have been used as such in some situations. Towards the end of World War I during the Final Offensive of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, on 19 October 1918 a German aircraft was destroyed on the ground by firing a Very light into the aircraft. The D.F.W. two-seater was first seen in the air; the first German aircraft since aerial fighting over Deraa on 16 and 17 September just prior to the beginning of the Battle of Sharon. The two-seater was forced to land and was destroyed after the German pilot and observer had moved to safety. In 1942, a German pilot mistakenly landed at the Pembrey Airfield in Wales. The duty pilot, Sgt. Jeffreys, did not have a conventional weapon, so he grabbed a Very pistol and used it to capture the German pilot, Oberleutnant Armin Faber.Pembrey Airport: History In World War II, Germany manufactured grenades designed to be fired from adapted flare guns known as the Kampfpistole, or Sturmpistole in its final form. The weapon was designed to function as an anti-tank weapon but failed to perform to expectations due to the minuscule amount of TNT carried in the hollow charge projectiles. In the latter stages of the Korean War, on November 2 of 1951, Lieutenant Edward Mastronardi and his 28-man platoon of the Royal Canadian Regiment were occupying a spur halfway between UN and Chinese lines known as the Song-gok. During the night, Chinese infantry launched several attacks against the spur. During the second attack, Mastronardi personally shot two Chinese soldiers with his Inglis Hi-Power pistol, and killed a third with his flare gun.  Conversion kits  Conversion kits are available intended to convert flare guns to accept conventional ammunition by use of barrel inserts. There are also 12 gauge inserts intended to allow use of rifle or pistol ammunition in conventional 12 gauge shotguns. Use of any of these devices in the Orion plastic 12 gauge flare gun is not recommended by the manufacturer and ATF tests have demonstrated that sometimes a single use results in a catastrophic failure. In the United States, if these conversion kits are used in a metal flare gun, the converted gun is considered to be a firearm by the ATF. If a rifled barrel insert is used, the converted firearm is classified as a pistol; if a smoothbore barrel insert is used, the converted firearm is classified as an AOW subject to the additional requirements of the NFA.\\"Flare Insert ‚Äì Any Other Weapon\\", ATF Firearms Technology Branch, May 4, 2006. Flare cartridges are low pressure compared to conventional ammunition and even metal flare guns are not designed or intended to be used with conventional ammunition. Conversion of a flare gun to fire conventional ammunition may also be restricted by local improvised firearm laws.

Vi·ªÖn's career trajectory was quite unique in coming from a criminal background to become a (non-Communist) leader of the Vi·ªát Minh's Zone 7, then later named a General, in charge of an auxiliary military force within the French Union, and, finally, named a General in the VNA. From 1951-55, he made arrangements with B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, by which the B√¨nh Xuy√™n was given control of their own affairs in return for their financial support of the government. In 1955, Vi·ªÖn flew to Paris with the help of Savani and the Deuxi√®me Bureau/SDECE after his unsuccessful attempt to oust the American-backed Premier, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. Biography=Early life L√™ VƒÉn Vi·ªÖn was born in Cholon in 1904 to a Chinese (Chaozhou) father and a Vietnamese mother. His father, L√™ VƒÉn D·∫≠u, joined the Vietnamese branch of the Tiandihui when he migrated to Vietnam.Nguyen Hung (2005), pp. 11, 12 Vi·ªÖn was head of the B√¨nh Xuy√™n and was hunted by the French in the 1930s and 1940s until he and a number of his cohorts were eventually captured and sentenced to confinement in the penal colony on C√¥n S∆°n Island. Ba D∆∞∆°ng, meanwhile, had become a labor broker for the Japanese and entered into a relationship with the Japanese secret service's southern Vietnamese agent, Matsushita Mitsuhiro, a pivotal clandestine operator who was undercover as the director of Dainan Koosi, and was controlled by the Japanese Consul General in Hanoi, Yoshio Minoda. Matsushita arranged for the kempeitai to free disparate B√¨nh Xuy√™n personalities and component gangs from C√¥n S∆°n in 1941. Thereafter, under Japanese patronage, the B√¨nh Xuy√™n grew rapidly, both in organization and influence. B·∫£y Vi·ªÖn escaped C√¥n S∆°n in early 1945 and returned to Saigon, where he engaged in insurgent politics in collusion with Ba D∆∞∆°ng and the Japanese. On 9 March 1945, the Japanese staged a coup d'√©tat against the Vichy French administration, jailing all French police. The B√¨nh Xuy√™n were given amnesty and B·∫£y Vi·ªÖn was installed as a police official by the newly established government. From brigand to revolutionary In August 1945, the Vi·ªát Minh chief of Cochinchina, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Gi√†u, formed an alliance with B·∫£y Vi·ªÖn and Ba D∆∞∆°ng against the French. When the Vi·ªát Minh called a mass demonstration on 25 August 1945: \\"... fifteen well armed, bare chested bandits carrying a large banner declaring 'B√¨nh Xuy√™n Assassination Committee' joined the tens of thousands of demonstrators who marched jubilantly through downtown Saigon for over nine hours.\\" Following the British-supported French counter- coup in September 1945, the Vi·ªát Minh withdrew from Saigon, leaving B·∫£y Vi·ªÖn as military commander of Cholon with a force of 100 men. Vi·ªÖn promptly formed an alliance with Lai Van Sang's two-thousand-man student group, the Avant- Garde Youth. Together with a number of Japanese deserters, they engaged the French. By the end of October, they were pushed back to the Rung Sat in a waterborne retrograde action which displayed as a key element the deployment of some 250 stay-behind agents. The B√¨nh Xuy√™n stay-behind agents promptly engaged in a ruthless campaign of terror and extortion. A constant influx of men, money and materiel quickly established the B√¨nh Xuy√™n as a well-armed, disciplined force of approximately 10,000 men. A dispute arose between Ba D∆∞∆°ng and the Vi·ªát Minh in January 1946. In February 1946, Ba D∆∞∆°ng was killed in a strafing raid by French aircraft. Revolutionary turned collaborator Sensing a shift in the political tide, B·∫£y Vi·ªÖn seized the opportunity to consolidate his hold on the B√¨nh Xuy√™n and achieve dominance. In the wake of Ba D∆∞∆°ng's death, Vi·ªÖn began secret negotiations with the French Deuxi√®me Bureau for exclusive rights to territory in Saigon, ultimately leading to a March 1948, agreement with Savani which was formalized on 16 June 1948. The French government announced that it \\"‚Ä¶ had decided to confide the police and maintenance of order to the B√¨nh Xuy√™n troops in a zone where they are used to operating.\\"Nguyen C√¥ng Luan Nationalist in the Viet Nam Wars 2012 \\"The regiment was sponsored by General L√™ VƒÉn Vi·ªÖn, leader of the B√¨nh Xuy√™n forces, once a powerful gang that had joined the Resistance before returning to S√†i G√≤n to collaborate with the French. \\"Naissance d'un Etat-parti: le Vi√™t Nam depuis 1945 Christopher E.

United States observers of the process laconically refer to the Binh Xuy√™n in this era as a: \\"... political and racketeering organization which had agreed to carry out police functions [for the Government of Viet-Nam] in return for a monopoly on gambling, opium traffic and prostitution in the metropolitan areas.\\" General Vi·ªÖn and the defeat of the B√¨nh Xuy√™n The United States backed Premier Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám in his fight to control South Vietnam. In the Battle of Saigon from 28 April to 3 May 1955, B·∫£y Vi·ªÖn and his loyal troops were forced back to the Rung Sat jungle where they were defeated by the regular army. Vi·ªÖn fled to exile in France and the organization fragmented, later resuming its clandestine form.

Rodgers is best known for his four victories in both the Boston Marathon, including three straight 1978-1980 and the New York City Marathon between 1976 and 1980. Biography=Early life Born in Hartford, Connecticut, the Rodgers family moved to Newington, Connecticut when Bill was around five. Rogers attended Newington High School, where he played hockey and baseball, along with his older brother Charlie. When Newington High School added cross country as a sport in the fall of 1963, sophomore Bill Rogers decided to join. Running track and cross country under coach Frank O‚ÄôRourke, Rodgers ran the mile in 4:28:8, won the 1965 Connecticut state cross country title and finished sixth in the New England Cross Country Championships. Running career In the fall of 1966, Rodgers enrolled at Wesleyan University where he ran cross country and track, graduating with a B.A. in sociology in 1970. One of his teammates and college roommate, Amby Burfoot, won the 1968 Boston Marathon while still a student at Wesleyan and went on to edit Runner's World magazine. Another teammate and friend was future Olympian Jeff Galloway, who is a noted author on running. After graduating in 1970, Rodgers enrolled to study and eventually receive his MS in special education from Boston College. After stepping away from competitive running for a time, in 1973, track coach Bill Squires first formed the Greater Boston Track Club at Boston College to train small group of local elite runners, with Rodgers becoming one of them. In April 1973, Rodgers entered his first Boston Marathon, dropping out at mile 20. After the race, Rodgers quit running for three months, only to return to training. Rodgers then won the Bay State Marathon in 2:28 in October 1973. In April 1974, Rodgers returned to run the Boston Marathon, finishing 14th. On October 29, 1974, Rodgers ran his first New York City Marathon, finishing fifth. One month after New York, Rodgers won the Philadelphia Marathon in 2:21. In 1975, Rodgers then burst into national prominence when he won the 1975 Boston Marathon in 2:09:55, setting a new American record. Rodgers won both the New York City Marathon and the Boston Marathon four times each between 1975 and 1980, twice breaking the American record at Boston with a time of 2:09:55 in 1975 and 2:09:27 in 1979. In 1977, he won the Fukuoka Marathon, making him the only runner ever to hold the championship of all three major marathons at the same time. He made the 1976 U.S. Olympic team and raced the marathon at the Montreal Olympics in 1976, finishing 40th in 2:25:14. He did not participate in the Olympics in 1980 due to the U.S. boycott over the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR. In 1975, Rodgers won the bronze medal at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships, equaling Tracy Smith's 1966 bronze in the International Cross Country Championships as the highest an American had ever finished in international cross country competition. Rodgers' most remarkable year on the road racing circuit came in 1978 when he won 27 of the 30 races he entered, including the Pepsi 10 km nationals (with a new world road 10 km best time of 28:36.3), the Falmouth Road Race, and the Boston & New York marathons. Rodgers is also the former world record holder for 25 kilometers as he broke Pekka P√§iv√§rinta's world record with a time of 1:14.11.8 on a track at West Valley College in Saratoga, California in 1979. Track & Field News ranked Rodgers #1 in the world in the marathon in 1975, 1977 and 1979. Of the 59 marathons Rodgers ran, 28 were run under 2:15. In all he won 22 marathons in his career. He came to be referred to by sportswriters and others as \\"Boston Billy\\". Rodgers was inducted on December 3, 1999, in Los Angeles, California to the National Track & Field Hall of Fame located in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1998, Rodgers was inducted in the first round to the National Distance Running Hall of Fame in Utica, New York. Rodgers has run the Bix 7 road race in Davenport, Iowa every year since 1980, earning the local nickname \\"Bix Billy\\". A bronze statue of Rodgers and Joan Benoit Samuelson was erected near the Bix finish line in 2007. On Patriots Day, April 20, 2015, Rodgers was honored by the Boston Red Sox as he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park. Bill Rodgers Running Center in Faneuil Hall Market Place in Boston, Massachusetts was owned and operated by Bill and his brother Charlie.

Geography The town is situated on a small island at the southern entrance to the Lagoon of Venice about south of Venice ( by road); causeways connect it to the mainland and to its frazione, nowadays a quarter, of Sottomarina. The population of the comune is around 50,000, with the town proper accounting for about half of that and Sottomarina for most of the rest. The municipality, located in south of the province, close to the provinces of Padua and Rovigo, borders with Campagna Lupia, Cavarzere, Codevigo, Cona, Correzzola, Loreo, Rosolina and Venice. History Chioggia and Sottomarina were not prominent in antiquity, although they are first mentioned in PlinyNH III.xvi.121 as the fossa Clodia. Local legend attributes this name to its founding by a Clodius, but the origin of this belief is not known. The name of the town has changed often, being Clodia, Cluza, Clugia, Chiozza and Chioggia.History of Chioggia The most ancient documents naming Chioggia date from the 6th century AD, when it was part of the Byzantine Empire. Chioggia was destroyed by King Pippin of Italy in the 9th century, but rebuilt around a new industry based on salt pans. In the Middle Ages, Chioggia proper was known as Clugia major, whereas Clugia minor was a sand bar about 600 m further into the Adriatic. A free commune and an episcopal see from 1110, it had later an important role in the so-called War of Chioggia between Genoa and Venice, being conquered by Genoa in 1378 and finally by Venice in June 1380. Although the town remained largely autonomous, it was always thereafter subordinate to Venice. On 14 March 1381, Chioggia concluded an alliance with Zadar and Trogir against Venice, and finally Chioggia became better protected by Venice in 1412, because ≈†ibenik became in 1412 the seat of the main customs office and the seat of the salt consumers office with a monopoly on the salt trade in Chioggia and on the whole Adriatic Sea. Culture Until the 19th century, women in Chioggia wore an outfit based on an apron which could be raised to serve as a veil. Chioggia is also known for lace-making; like Pellestrina, but unlike Burano, this lace is made using bobbins. Chioggia served Carlo Goldoni as the setting of his play Le baruffe chiozzotte, one of the classics of Italian literature: a baruffa was a loud brawl, and chiozzotto (today more frequently chioggiotto in Italian, or cioxoto in Venetian) is the demonym for Chioggia. Goldoni took his setting seriously: the play is replete with lacemaking, fishermen, and other local color. Main sights Chioggia is a miniature version of Venice, and is often called \\"Little Venice\\", with a few canals, chief among them the Canale Vena, and the characteristic narrow streets known as calli. Chioggia has several medieval churches, much reworked in the period of its greatest prosperity in the 16th and 17th centuries. The church dedicated to St. Mary of the Assumption, founded in the eleventh century, became a cathedral in 1110, then was rebuilt as Chioggia Cathedral from 1623 by Baldassarre Longhena. The church of St. Andrew (18th century) has a bell tower from the 11th-12th centuries, the most ancient tower watch in the world. The interior has a Crucifixion by Palma the Elder.

It is relatively large by Maldive standards. The origin of the word \\"Gan\\" is in the Sanskrit word \\"Grama\\", meaning \\"village\\". Gan is the second largest island of the atoll, after Hithadhoo, and measures in area. Gan was formerly inhabited, but its inhabitants were moved to neighbouring islands after the British naval and airbase was built. It has had continuous human habitation since very ancient times. There were large cultivated fields of yams, manioc and coconut trees on this island. A former havitta at island's east end had to be removed to build the runway. Gan has now a hotel catering for tourists and is connected by causeways to the neighbouring islands of Feydu, Maradu and Hithadhoo. This island is not to be confused with two other Maldive islands called \\"Gan\\": Gan (Huvadhu Atoll) and Gan (Laamu Atoll). Archaeology In 1922 H. C. P. Bell visited this island and investigated the ancient Buddhist ruins there. These included the foundations of a temple (vihara) and a mound or low hill which was a very ruined stupa. Gan's ruins were the remains of the southernmost Buddhist site of the Maldives. The mound, as well as the foundations of the nearby vihara, were bulldozed when the airport was built. British base In 1941, during the Second World War, the Royal Navy established a base (\\"Port T\\"). An isolated island base with a safe, deep anchorage in a suitably strategic position was required, and Addu met the requirements. Once available, its facilities were used extensively by the Fleet. Royal Navy engineers landed in August 1941 from HMS Guardian to clear and construct airstrips on Gan for the Fleet Air Arm. In the interim, Catalina and Sunderland flying boats operated from jetties on the northern, sheltered side of Gan. Large oil tanks were built on Gan, and on Hitaddu Island on the western edge of the atoll; vital elements for a naval base. These were visible from a long distances at sea, but this was unavoidable, given the atoll's low profile. Ship's supplies for the fleet were provided from a pair of Australian refrigerated ships, Changte and Taiping that included Addu in a number of bases that they serviced regularly. Three times these ships replenished forty or more ships of the Eastern Fleet. Several large Australian Imperial Force troop convoys also refueled at Addu on their way from Aden to Fremantle, Western Australia. The six major islands were garrisoned by the 1st Royal Marine Coast Defence Regiment, manning shore batteries and anti-aircraft guns. To facilitate the defence, causeways were built connecting the western islands of Gan, Eyehook (Abuhera), Maradhoo and Hithadhoo and, much later in the war, they were linked by a light railway. Addu was an unpopular posting due to the hot, humid climate, lack of recreational facilities and lack of socialising with the local population. The Japanese remained unaware of the base‚Äôs existence until their plans for expansion in South-east Asia had come to nothing, even during their carrier raids in the Indian Ocean in April 1942. Later in the war, submarine reconnaissance established the base‚Äôs existence. Despite openings into the lagoon being permanently closed by anti-submarine nets, the German U-boat U-183 torpedoed the tanker British Loyalty in March 1944 (she had been previously torpedoed and sunk at Diego Suarez in May 1942, but was raised and towed to Addu for use as an oil storage vessel); this was a long-range shot from outside the atoll through a gap in the anti-torpedo nets.British Loyalty at uboat.net; retrieved 12 November 2019 Although seriously damaged, the tanker did not sink. She was not fully repaired but kept as a Ministry of War Transport Oil Fuel Storage Vessel. There was significant oil pollution after this incident and British personnel were used to clean the lagoon, but they were only partially successful. On 5 January 1946, British Loyalty was scuttled southeast of Hithadhoo Island in the Addu Atoll lagoon. Despite the fact that she is still leaking oil, she has become a popular diving location. In 1957, the naval base was transferred to the Royal Air Force. From 1957, during the Cold War, it was used as an outpost as RAF Gan. The base remained in intermittent service until 1976, when British Forces withdrew. From Gan Island several rockets of the Kookaburra type were launched from a pad at 0¬∞41' S and 73¬∞9' E. Most of the employees who had experience working for the British military spoke fluent English. When the base at Gan was closed for good, they turned to the nascent tourism industry for employment. As a result, there was an influx of Addu people to Mal√© seeking employment in the nearby resorts and also looking for education for their children. After the British military left, the airstrip was neglected and remained almost unused for many decades. Recently it has been developed into what is now Gan International Airport. Climate Gan has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round. See also * Gan (Huvadhu Atoll) * Gan (Laamu Atoll) References * H.C.P.

Founding and early history Arthur Tooth Alexander Heriot Mackonochie The society was founded on 28 February 1855 at the chapel of the House of Charity, Soho, London, by six priests: Charles Fuge Lowder, Charles Maurice Davies, David Nicols, Alfred Poole, Joseph Newton Smith and Henry Augustus Rawes. The society they formed was initially intended as a spiritual association for their personal edification, but it soon came to be the driving force behind the Anglo-Catholic movement, particularly after the first phase of the Oxford Movement had played its course and John Henry Newman had been received into the Roman Catholic Church. Lowder was the founder of the society and served as its first master. While visiting France in 1854, he conceived of the idea of an order of Anglican priests based on the Lazarists, a Roman Catholic order founded by St Vincent de Paul. The society provided its members with a rule of life and a vision of a disciplined priestly life. Mutual support has always been a key element and the life of the society is experienced primarily through the local chapter. Attendance at chapter is of obligation unless prevented by genuine pastoral duties. The society expanded almost immediately. These early priests of the society ministered in some of the poorest slum areas of London and other cities. These included the parishes of St Barnabas' Pimlico and St Peter's, London Docks. Many of these areas were so dangerous that bishops refused to visit them, although their refusal was also motivated by a distaste for the ritualism of the Anglo-Catholic clergy. Anglo-Catholic ritualism was very close to practices in the Roman Catholic Church and included devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, frequent celebration of the Mass with intentions, the practice of confession, the wearing of eucharistic vestments, the use of incense, liturgical hand bells and wafer bread. Whilst these practices had not been completely unknown in the Church of England since its break with the Roman Catholic Church, most of them had not been in general use for hundreds of years as the Church of England had become increasingly influenced by Protestantism in its liturgical practice during and after the reigns of Edward VI and Elizabeth I. SSC priests considered these practices an outward and necessary and physical expression of belief and doctrine and not merely as aesthetic adornments to worship. The society was primarily concerned with improving the spiritual life of priests and people. For example, the now common practice of retreats was introduced to the Church of England in those given by SSC priests, beginning in 1856. Many Low Church and Latitudinarian Anglicans viewed ritualism and the accompanying teaching with horror. It was not unusual for Mass and the Divine Office in SSC parishes to be disrupted by Protestant protesters, some hired for the occasion, shouting during the readings and sermon or hurling furniture and books. Lawsuits were filed against priests for Catholic practices. Some of these prosecutions were successful and priests were suspended from their ministries. In other actions, some Catholic practices were permitted by the courts while others were ruled illegal. Still other practices were sometimes ruled by the civil courts not to be illegal per se but that their continued use would require direct authorisation by the diocesan bishop. Public Worship Regulation Act The legal inconsistencies led to the passing of the Public Worship Regulation Act by the Disraeli government in 1874 with the stated aim of \\"putting down the Ritualists\\". The act was introduced in the House of Lords as a Private Member's Bill by Archibald Tait, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had previously served as the Bishop of London. After the act came into force, on 1 July 1875, the Church Association, which had been responsible for some the pre-act lawsuits, began vigorously prosecuting those who persisted in Anglo- Catholic practice and teaching. Seventeen priests were prosecuted under the act. In some cases these priests served time in prison for either not acknowledging the right of the courts to judge them on matters of worship or after being convicted. Occasionally some bishops (including Archbishop Tait) would intervene to stop prosecutions, particularly as public outrage grew at the blatant interference in religious matters by secular courts. The prosecution of SSC priests Arthur Tooth, Alexander Heriot Mackonochie and Richard William Enraght are among the most notable episodes in the early history of the society. In the 20th century The prosecutions, however, were battles won in a losing war. In 1906, a royal commission effectively nullified the act by admitting that more pluralism in public worship was needed. The selfless example of SSC priests in ministering to the lowest orders of society and their strong stands on social justice had also endeared them to the general public, not least the example of Fr Lowder, founder of the Society, staying in Wapping to provide care to his people during the cholera outbreak of 1866. Alexander Penrose Forbes, Bishop of Brechin in the Scottish Episcopal Church from 1847 till his death in 1874, was probably the first of many SSC bishops around the world, including the saintly Frank Weston, Bishop of Zanzibar. As a Catholic society, SSC has taken a conservative line in the church controversies of the late 20th century, particularly over the interpretation of scripture and the ordination of women. 21st century As of October 2017 there are over 1,000 members of the society organised into provinces for England and Scotland, the Americas, Wales and Australasia, each under a provincial master reporting to an international master general. There are also some members in the Lutheran Church of Sweden. The current master general of the society is Fr Nicolas Spicer SSC, also the provincial master for England and Scotland, who resides in England. The brethren are united together in their keeping of a common rule of life, which bears much in common with the original rule from the founders of the society. In April 2005, the society celebrated its 150th anniversary with a week-long festival, \\"Stand Up For Jesus\\". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, addressed the gathering and the Royal Albert Hall was filled to capacity for the closing Mass. The 2017 provincial synod The fortunes of SSC have waxed and waned since the early days of the Catholic Revival, but for its members it has always been an important source of priestly formation, discipline and fraternity. The brethren of the society meet in regular chapter and in annual regional, or national synods. Priests of the society can be recognised by the small gold lapel cross that they generally wear. On it is inscribed the motto of the society, In Hoc Signo Vinces (\\"In this sign conquer\\"). There is also a section of the society, the Pusey Guild, for ordinands and approved candidates for training for the priesthood.

Rosenberg and published in 1991. A highly controversial work, it produced labels ranging from \\"revolutionary\\" to \\"insulting.\\" A Second Edition of the book was published in 2008 by the University of Chicago Press (). Basic thesis and controversy In his book, Gerald Rosenberg questions the validity of the commonly accepted axiom that the Supreme Court of the United States is able to effect widespread social change. Naturally, such a drastic departure from conventional beliefs drew the ire of many critics, both within and beyond academia. Dynamic Court and Constrained Court Rosenberg examines two views of the United States Supreme Court: the view of the Dynamic Court and the view of the Constrained Court. The Dynamic Court view maintains that the United States Supreme Court is indeed capable of affecting widespread change, often citing cases such as Brown v. Board and Roe v. Wade as examples. The Constrained Court view, on the other hand, holds that because of the existing constraints imposed upon the Court by the United States Constitution and the United States Congress, the Court is unable to accomplish significant change. Rosenberg sides largely with the Constrained Court view. He studies several landmark cases that have been handed down from the Court, such as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954) and Roe v. Wade (1973), and asserts that in each examined situation, the Court was largely unable to attain any tangible, empirically-measurable change. Rosenberg names three constraints that preclude the US Supreme Court from being truly effective, and arrives at the conclusion that although the Court is indeed capable of accomplishing significant change, such change can only occur when these three constraints are overcome. First Constraint The First Constraint is that the nature of constitutional rights precludes the Court from hearing or effectively acting on many significant social reform claims and lessens the chances of popular mobilization. This Constraint can be overcome if there exists sufficient precedent for change based on the Judiciary's interpretation of the Constitution. Second Constraint The Second Constraint is that the Court does not have sufficient independence from the legislative and executive branches to affect significant social reform. This Constraint can be overcome by securing support from substantial numbers in Congress and securing the support of the executive branch. Third Constraint The Third Constraint is that the Court does not have the power to develop necessary policy and implement decisions that could affect significant reform. Because, as Alexander Hamilton put it, the Court controls neither the sword (Executive branch) nor the purse (Legislative branch), it must rely on cooperation from the other two branches in order to enforce its decisions. This Constraint can be overcome either by securing support of citizens or at least not having significant opposition from all citizens. Empirical studies Rosenberg maintains that the efforts made by women's rights, pro-choice, and civil rights activists to use the courts to produce social change have not been very effective. To prove and support this claim, he examines a great deal of statistical information. In looking at the effects that Brown v. Board had on desegregation, for example, Rosenberg looks at the percentage of black schoolchildren attending mixed schools in the South in the years preceding this landmark decision, and the years following it. He finds that almost no measurable change had occurred in the ten years following this decision. Indeed, it is not until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that the percentage begins to increase annually. Similarly, in looking at Roe v. Wade, he finds that the annual number of legal abortions did not seem to be greatly affected by the Court's decision. Criticism There is a great deal of criticism leveled at The Hollow Hope. Critics maintain that Rosenberg's argument ignores the implications of court decisions on future actions that created more direct change. There are similar omissions in discussion of Martin Luther King Jr., who cited Brown v. Board as a reason for mobilizing his followers in a speech given on a night preceding a boycott. Despite these drawbacks, many agree that Rosenberg presents a provocative if flawed argument against the conventional wisdom that the United States Supreme Court is a powerful judicial body capable of introducing significant change. However, these same critics maintain that Rosenberg relies on faulty assumptions, such as the duality of man.

In spectroscopy, this distribution, with frequency as the dependent variable, is known as a van der Waals profile.\\"van der Waals profile\\" appears with lowercase \\"van\\" in almost all sources, such as: Statistical mechanics of the liquid surface by Clive Anthony Croxton, 1980, A Wiley-Interscience publication, , , ; and in Journal of technical physics, Volume 36, by Instytut Podstawowych Problem√≥w Techniki (Polska Akademia Nauk), publisher: Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawn. Naukowe., 1995, It is a special case of the inverse-gamma distribution. It is a stable distribution. Definition The probability density function of the L√©vy distribution over the domain x\\\\ge \\\\mu is :f(x;\\\\mu,c)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{c}{2\\\\pi}}~~\\\\frac{e^{ -\\\\frac{c}{2(x-\\\\mu)}}} {(x-\\\\mu)^{3/2}} where \\\\mu is the location parameter and c is the scale parameter. The cumulative distribution function is :F(x;\\\\mu,c)=\\\\textrm{erfc}\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{c}{2(x-\\\\mu)}}\\\\right) where \\\\textrm{erfc}(z) is the complementary error function. The shift parameter \\\\mu has the effect of shifting the curve to the right by an amount \\\\mu, and changing the support to the interval [\\\\mu, \\\\infty). Like all stable distributions, the Levy distribution has a standard form f(x;0,1) which has the following property: :f(x;\\\\mu,c)dx = f(y;0,1)dy\\\\, where y is defined as :y = \\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{c}\\\\, The characteristic function of the L√©vy distribution is given by :\\\\varphi(t;\\\\mu,c)=e^{i\\\\mu t-\\\\sqrt{-2ict}}. Note that the characteristic function can also be written in the same form used for the stable distribution with \\\\alpha=1/2 and \\\\beta=1: :\\\\varphi(t;\\\\mu,c)=e^{i\\\\mu t-ct^{1/2}~(1-i~\\\\textrm{sign}(t))}. Assuming \\\\mu=0, the nth moment of the unshifted L√©vy distribution is formally defined by: :m_n\\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{c}{2\\\\pi}}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{-c/2x}\\\\,x^n}{x^{3/2}}\\\\,dx which diverges for all n\\\\geq 0.5 so that the integer moments of the L√©vy distribution do not exist (only some fractional moments). The moment generating function would be formally defined by: :M(t;c)\\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{c}{2\\\\pi}}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{-c/2x+tx}}{x^{3/2}}\\\\,dx however this diverges for t>0 and is therefore not defined on an interval around zero, so the moment generating function is not defined per se. Like all stable distributions except the normal distribution, the wing of the probability density function exhibits heavy tail behavior falling off according to a power law: :f(x;\\\\mu,c) \\\\sim \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{c}{2\\\\pi}}\\\\frac{1}{x^{3/2}} as x\\\\to\\\\infty, which shows that L√©vy is not just heavy-tailed but also fat-tailed. This is illustrated in the diagram below, in which the probability density functions for various values of c and \\\\mu=0 are plotted on a log‚Äìlog plot. Probability density function for the L√©vy distribution on a log‚Äìlog plot The standard L√©vy distribution satisfies the condition of being stable : (X_1 + X_2 + \\\\dotsb + X_n) \\\\sim n^{1/\\\\alpha}X , where X_1, X_2, \\\\ldots, X_n, X are independent standard L√©vy- variables with \\\\alpha=1/2.

On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 crewmembers Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar Module Eagle at approximately 20:17:40 UTC. Armstrong exited the spacecraft six hours 39 minutes after touchdown, followed 19 minutes later by Aldrin. The astronauts spent two hours 31 minutes examining and photographing the lunar surface, setting up several scientific experiment packages, and collecting of dirt and rock samples for return to Earth. They lifted off the surface on July 21 at 17:54 UTC. Tranquility Base was named by Aldrin and Armstrong, and first announced by Armstrong when the Lunar Module Eagle landed. Its lunar coordinates are 00¬∞41‚Ä≤15‚Ä≥N, 23¬∞26‚Ä≤00‚Ä≥E, in the south-western corner of the lunar lava-plain called Mare Tranquillitatis (\\"Sea of Tranquility\\"). Site selection For more than two years, NASA planners considered a collection of 30 potential sites for the first crewed landing. Based on high-resolution photographs taken by the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft, and photos and data taken by the uncrewed Surveyor landers, this list was narrowed down to five sites located near the lunar equator, ranging between 45 degrees east and west, and 5 degrees north and south of the center of the Moon's facing side; these were numbered 1 to 5 going from east to west. Site number 2, centered at , was the Sea of Tranquility site ultimately chosen. Since a precision landing was not expected on the first mission, the target area was an ellipse measuring east- west by north-south. On the landing, a combination of thrust from residual pressure in the docking tunnel that connected the Lunar Module with the command module Columbia in orbit, and an imperfect understanding of the Moon's uneven gravitational field, resulted in navigation errors which pushed the powered descent initiation point about , and thus the computer-targeted landing spot about , downrange (west) of the planned target. The automated targeting system was taking Eagle toward what Armstrong described as a \\"football-field sized crater, with a large number of big boulders and rocks for about one or two crater diameters around it\\", which he avoided by assuming manual control and flying a bit farther downrange. The landing was still within the target ellipse. Name Apollo Lunar Module Eagle and lands on the Moon, July 20, 1969, creating Tranquility Base Armstrong named the site at 20:17:58 UTC, approximately 18 seconds after his and Aldrin's successful landing, as he announced: > Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed. During training, Armstrong and Aldrin had exclusively used the callsign \\"Eagle\\" in simulated ground conversations, both before and after landing.Failure is Not an Option. History, 24 August 2003. Armstrong and Aldrin decided on using \\"Tranquility Base\\" just before the flight, telling only Capsule Communicator Charles Duke before the mission, so Duke would not be taken by surprise. Author's note on page 206. The name has become a permanent designation for the site. Although the name was designated by the Apollo astronauts, the International Astronomical Union officially recognizes the designation \\"Tranquility Base\\". It is listed on lunar maps as Statio Tranquillitatis, conforming to the standard use of Latin for lunar place names. Status plaque left at Tranquility Base on the Lunar Module Descent Stage which commemorates the first crewed lunar landing (photographed by Neil Armstrong) About 100 artificial objects and footprints left by Armstrong and Aldrin remain at Tranquility Base. The descent stage of the Lunar Module remains at the original point of landing. According to Aldrin (with apparent confirmation from later Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter photos), the US flag planted at the site during their moonwalk was blown over by the ascent rocket exhaust, but ostensibly remains there. A laser reflector was placed at the site to allow precise ongoing measurements of the distance to the Moon from Earth. A solar-powered seismometer was also left to measure moonquakes, but this stopped functioning after 21 days. A disc containing the Apollo 11 goodwill messages was left at the site, and various gear that was no longer needed for the return phase of the mission‚Äîincluding Aldrin's boots‚Äîwas left behind to lighten the craft for return to lunar orbit. As the site of the first human landing on an extraterrestrial body, Tranquility Base has cultural and historic significance. The U.S. states of California and New Mexico have listed it on their heritage registers, since their laws require only that listed sites have some association with the state. Texas has not granted similar status to the site, despite the location of Mission Control in Houston, as its historic preservation laws limit such designations to properties located within the state. The U.S. National Park Service has declined to grant it National Historic Landmark status to avoid violating the Outer Space Treaty's prohibition on any nation claiming sovereignty over any extraterrestrial body. It has not been proposed as a World Heritage Site since the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which oversees that program, limits nations to submitting sites within their own borders. Interest in according the site some formal protection grew in the early 21st century with the announcement of the Google Lunar X Prize for private corporations to successfully build spacecraft and reach the Moon; a $1 million bonus was offered for any competitor that visited a historic site on the Moon. One team, led by Astrobotic Technology, announced it would attempt to land a craft at Tranquility Base. Although it canceled those plans, the ensuing controversy led NASA to request that any other missions to the Moon, private or governmental, human or robotic, keep a distance of at least from the site. In July 2019, the One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space ActOne Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space Act, was introduced and passed in the U.S. Senate to protect Tranquility Base and other Apollo landing sites from damage from US-licensed space activity.

Born in England but raised in the Toronto suburb of Malton, Ontario, Devon formed his first band, Shock Waves, at the age of 14 years, releasing an independent single in 1977. Later he was a member of the reggae band 20th Century Rebels, and served as a backing musician for Bong Conga Nistas, Messenjah, Judy Mowatt and Lillian Allen. Although the title of his single \\"Mr. Metro\\" referred to the Toronto Police Service, the song was in fact inspired by incidents of police racism across North America, including his own detention by police in Redondo Beach, California, rather than in Toronto alone. Despite this, the Toronto Police Service threatened to arrest him on defamation charges, forcing him to black out parts of the video which might have been perceived as identifying Toronto police officers. The video went on to win a MuchMusic Video Award in 1990. In 1990, he collaborated on the one-off single \\"Can't Repress the Cause\\", a plea for greater inclusion of hip hop music in the Canadian music scene, with Dance Appeal, a supergroup of Toronto-area musicians that included Maestro Fresh Wes, Dream Warriors, Michie Mee, B-Kool, Lillian Allen, Eria Fachin, HDV, Dionne, Thando Hyman, Carla Marshall, Messenjah, Jillian Mendez, Lorraine Scott, Lorraine Segato, Self Defense, Leroy Sibbles, Zama and Thyron Lee White. After the song \\"Mr. Metro\\", Devon released his first solo album It's My Nature in 1992. The following year (1993), he won the Juno Award for Best Rap Recording with the album Keep It Slammin'. In 1997, he relocated to Vancouver and signed to indie label Rated-R Recordz owned by Ray Rated-R Montani, where he released the EP and single both entitled Pressure, which were released in 1998, and feature Orin Issacs.

This was Chaplin's first full-length film as a director (he had been a co-star in 1914's Tillie's Punctured Romance). It was a huge success, and was the second-highest-grossing film in 1921, behind The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In 2011, The Kid was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Innovative in its combination of comedic and dramatic elements,Chaplin, pp. 233‚Äì234. The Kid is widely considered one of the greatest films of the silent era.300 Greatest Films by Decade - AMC Filmsite Retrieved February 8, 2015 Plot An unmarried mother (Edna Purviance) leaves a charity hospital with her newborn son; a short scene shows that the baby's apparent artist father (Carl Miller) has lost interest in her. With much anguish the mother abandons the child, placing him in an expensive automobile, with a handwritten note: \\"Please love and care for this orphan child\\". Two thieves steal the car and leave the baby in an alley, where he is found by The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin). After some slapstick attempts to hand the child off to various passersby, he finds the note and his heart melts. He takes the boy home, names him John and adjusts his household furniture for him. Meanwhile, the mother has a change of heart and returns for her baby but she learns that the car has been stolen and faints. Five years pass. The Kid (Jackie Coogan) and the Tramp live in the same tiny room; they have little money but much love. They support themselves in a minor scheme: the Kid throws stones to break windows so that the Tramp, working as a glazier, can earn money repairing them. Meanwhile, the mother has become a wealthy actress. She does charity by giving presents to poor children. By chance, the mother and the Kid cross paths, but of course do not know each other. The Kid later gets into a fight with another local boy as people in the area gather to watch the spectacle. The Kid wins, drawing the ire of the other boy's older brother, who attacks the Tramp as a result. The Mother breaks up the fight, though the Tramp still beats the \\"Big Brother\\" over the head with a brick repeatedly until he walks away. Shortly afterward, the Mother advises the Tramp to call a doctor after the Kid falls ill. The doctor discovers that the Tramp is not the Kid's father, and notifies authorities. Two men come to take the boy to an orphanage, but after a fight and a chase, the Tramp and the boy remain side by side. When the Mother comes back to see how the boy is doing she encounters the doctor, who shows her the note (which he had taken from the Tramp); she recognizes it as the one she left with her baby years ago. Now fugitives, the Tramp and the boy spend the night in a flophouse. Its proprietor learns of a $1000 reward offered by the authorities and takes the Kid to the police station, while the Tramp is asleep. As the tearful Mother is reunited with her long-lost child, the Tramp searches frantically for the missing boy. Unsuccessful, he returns to the doorway of their humble home, where he falls asleep. He enters \\"Dreamland,\\" where his neighbors have turned into angels and devils. He is awakened by a policeman, who leads him away, taking him to a mansion. The door is opened by the Mother and the Kid, who jumps into the Tramp's arms. The policeman congratulates the Tramp and the Mother welcomes the Tramp into her home.

The Kid is notable for combining comedy and drama. As the opening title says: \\"A picture with a smile‚Äîand perhaps, a tear.\\" Its most famous and enduring sequence is the Tramp's desperate rooftop pursuit of the truck taking the child to the orphanage, and their emotional reunion. The film made Coogan, then a vaudeville performer, into the first major child star of the movies. Many of the Chaplin biographers have attributed the relationship portrayed in the film to have resulted from the death of Chaplin's firstborn infant son just ten days before the production began. The portrayal of poverty and the cruelty of welfare workers are also directly reminiscent of Chaplin's own childhood in London. Several of the street scenes were filmed on Los Angeles's famed Olvera Street, almost 10 years before it was converted into a Mexican- themed tourist attraction. \\"The Kid\\" pleading to be left with his \\"father\\", Chaplin After production was completed in 1920, the film was caught up in the divorce actions of Chaplin's first wife Mildred Harris, who sought to attach Chaplin's assets. Chaplin and his associates smuggled the raw negative to Salt Lake City (reportedly packed in coffee cans) and edited the film in a room at the Hotel Utah. Before releasing the film Chaplin negotiated for and received an enhanced financial deal for the film with his distributor, First National Corporation, based on the success of the final film. Twelve-year-old Lita Grey, who portrays an angel in the film, was Chaplin's second wife from 1924 to 1927. In 1972, Chaplin edited and reissued the film and he composed a new musical score. Chaplin and Coogan met for the last time in 1972, during Chaplin's brief return to America to receive an honorary Academy Award for his lifetime contribution to cinema. Reception The Kid was acclaimed by film critics upon its release. A reviewer from Theatre Magazine glowingly wrote, \\"[Chaplin's] new picture, The Kid, certainly outdoes in humor and the special brand of Chaplin pathos anything this popular film star has yet produced. There are almost as many tears as laughs in the new First National release-- which proves the contention that Chaplin as almost as good a tragedian as he is a comedian. The Kid may be counted as a screen masterpiece.\\" Legacy Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance writes of the legacy of Chaplin's The Kid: \\"The Kid remains an important contribution to the art of film, not only because of Chaplin‚Äôs innovative use of dramatic sequences within a feature- length comedy, but also because of the revelations The Kid provides about its creator. Undoubtedly, when Chaplin penned the preface to The Kid, ‚ÄúA picture with a smile--and perhaps, a tear,‚Äù he had his own artistic credo‚Äîand life‚Äîin mind.\\"Vance, Jeffrey (2003). Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema. New York: Harry N. Abrams, pg. 117. . Mary Pickford said of the film, \\"The Kid is one of the finest examples of the screen language, depending upon its actions rather than upon subtitles\\". The Kid In December 2011, The Kid was chosen to be preserved in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry. The registry stated that the film is \\"an artful melding of touching drama, social commentary and inventive comedy\\" and praised Chaplin's ability to \\"sustain his artistry beyond the length of his usual short subjects and could deftly elicit a variety of emotions from his audiences by skillfully blending slapstick and pathos.\\" As of June 2019, The Kid has earned a rare 100% perfect rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 30 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.51/10. and a 8.3 user rating on the Internet Movie Database, placing it at #103 among the site's Top 250 Titles. Remakes In May 2017, it was announced that FilmNation Entertainment is remaking The Kid as an animated sci-fi movie. \\"The Kid, an animated adventure\\" will be directed by Christian Volckman and Rupert Wyatt and is \\"inspired by the characters and themes in The Kid.\\" As of 2019 it was still in development.

Today it is a major part of the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, hosting several radar systems used for tracking and characterizing missile reentry vehicles (RV) and their penetration aids (penaids). Etymology The name of the new island after the formerly separate islands Roi and Namur were joined by landfill. Roi is originally from Marshallese Ruot, while Namur is originally from Marshallese NimÃßur. History Germany annexed the Marshalls in 1885 but did not put government officials on the islands until 1906, leaving island affairs to a group of powerful German trading companies. Under the Treaty of Versailles, Japan took over after World War I. They colonised the Marshalls extensively, developing and fortifying large bases on many of the islands. Roi-Namur was the target of the U.S. 4th Marine Division in the Battle of Kwajalein, in February 1944. During the Japanese occupation, the two islands (Roi to the west (Marshallese: , ) and Namur to the east (, )) were connected by a narrow neck of land and causeway. After the American occupation, US Navy SeaBees filled the area between the islands by December 1944; the two now joined islands are presently called Roi-Namur with a total area of about one square mile. Roi-Namur was selected by DARPA as a host site for a series of radar experiments under the Project Defender umbrella, and Project PRESS in particular. These experiments intended to use radar means to distinguish an enemy RV from its penaids though the examination of the size, shape and velocity of the objects, as well as examining the wake they left in the upper atmosphere. By building on Roi- Namur, they were able to use the test shots being used by the US Army's Nike-X program installed on Kwajalein Island and Meck Island further to the south. The island was flooded in March 2014 by a \\"massive wave\\" which swamped coastal roads. Today Roi-Namur is home to an about 120 American and Marshallese employees of the Reagan Test Site. The Roi side is the main housing area, with the retail and recreation facilities there. Activities on Roi-Namur range from a nine-hole golf course, saltwater swimming pool, scuba club, movie theater, volleyball, and basketball court. Roi hosts the Freeflight International Airport (Marshall Islands) with one runway for small planes that commute from Kwajalein bringing additional workers. Additional Marshallese daytime workers come via ferry from the island of Enniburr. The Namur side is home to the ALCOR, ALTAIR, MMW and TRADEX radar tracking stations. There is a small launch facility on Roi-Namur. Rockets launched here are usually sounding rockets that ascend beyond the atmosphere but have short ranges. There are crumbling remnants of Japanese blockhouses and pillboxes around Roi-Namur. File:Wyspy Roi-Namur - mapa.PNGMap of Roi-Namur during World War II. The causeway is roughly centered.

Deposit values (from 50 tyiyn to 2 Kyrgyz som, i.e. 2‚Äì5 U.S. cents) for various bottle types are posted next to the sample bottles on a rack. Container-deposit legislation (also known as a deposit- refund system, bottle bill, or deposit-return system) is any law that requires the collection of a monetary deposit on beverage containers (refillable or non-refillable) at the point of sale and/or the payment of refund value to the consumers. When the container is returned to an authorized redemption center, or retailer in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly or fully refunded to the redeemer (presumed to be the original purchaser). It is a deposit-refund system. Governments may pass container deposit legislation for several reasons, including, for example: * To encourage recycling and complement existing curbside recycling programs, to reduce energy and material usage for containers * To specifically reduce beverage container litter along highways, in lakes and rivers, and on other public or private properties (where beverage container litter occurs, a nominal deposit provides an economic incentive to clean it up; this is a significant source of income to some poor individuals and non-profit civic organizations) * To extend the usable lifetime of taxpayer-funded landfills Deposits that are not redeemed are often kept by distributors or bottlers to cover the costs of the system (including handling fees paid to retailers or redemption centers to collect, sort, and handle the containers) or are escheated to the governmental entity involved to fund environmental programs. History A & R Thwaites & Co in Dublin, Ireland, announced in 1799 the provision of artificial \\"soda water\\" and that they paid 2 shillings a dozen for returned bottles. Schweppes, who were also in the business of artificially made mineral waters, had a similar recycling policy from about 1800, without any legislation. Scottish bottled beverage companies also voluntarily introduced such a scheme to encourage the return of their bottles for reuse. In Sweden a standard system for deposits on bottles and recycling was established in 1884, eventually by law. The popular demand for a deposit on aluminium cans to reduce littering led to legislation in 1984. In North America, British Columbia's legislated deposit-return system, enacted in 1970, is the oldest such program in North America. Container-deposit legislation by country=AmericasCanada= In 1970, British Columbia became the first Canadian province to establish a mandatory deposit- return system for soft drinks and beer containers. Today, nearly all provinces and territories in Canada have followed suit; the territory of Nunavut is the only jurisdiction in Canada that has yet to implement some sort of deposit refund system. Deposits range from CAD$0.05 to CAD$0.40 per unit depending on the material and size of the container and whether the container contains an alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage. Below is a brief summary of each program: * British Columbia: While the original program covered only carbonated soft drinks and beer, the deposit legislation expanded to include any ready-to- serve beverage sold in a container that is sealed by its manufacturer (e.g. bottled water, juice, new age drinks, and alcohol), excluding milk and milk substitutes. There are currently two stewardship agencies in BC that carry out deposit-refund obligations on behalf of beverage producers: Encorp Pacific (for non-alcoholic beverages, wine, spirits, some ciders and coolers, and some import beer) and Brewers Distributor Ltd. (BDL) (for domestic coolers, beers, and ciders). In 2017, BC's program recovered over 1 billion containers for an overall return-rate of 75.8%. Bottle deposit on single use beverage containers have increased to CDN $0.10 from CDN $0.05 in November 2019. * Alberta: All beverage containers (glass bottles, metal cans, Tetra Paks, gable-top cartons, bags-in-boxes, plastic bottles and jugs, drink pouches), including milk containers (Alberta was the first jurisdiction in North America to accept and charge a deposit on milk containers in June 2009), are charged deposits at the point of sale; 10¬¢ for containers 1 L or less, and 25¬¢ for containers larger than 1 L. Containers can be dropped off at depots and are picked up by the Alberta Beverage Container Recycling Corporation. In 2014, over 2 billion beverage containers were returned to Alberta depots for an overall return rate of 83%. * Saskatchewan: Established in 1988, Saskatchewan's deposit-return program applies to all ready-to-serve beverage containers, except those for meal replacements, or dietary supplements. SARCAN began taking milk and milk substitutes on April 1, 2017. SARCAN Recycling is responsible for administering the program and operates under contract to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment. In fiscal 2014-2015, a total of 405.6 million beverage containers were returned to SARCAN recycling depots for an overall container return rate of 87%. * Manitoba: Manitoba's program was implemented in 2010 and is limited to beer containers, which are charged a deposit of CAD$0.10 or $0.20 depending on the size. Other containers (except milk) are charged a non-refundable $0.02 per unit levy (Container Recycling Fee) and can be recycled in municipal curbside recycling programs. * Ontario: The Ontario Deposit Return Program (ODRP), which came into force in February 2007, is a voluntary program implemented by the provincial government that covers wine, spirits, and imported beer containers (plastics, metal, bimetal, glass, gable top, Tetra Pak, bag-in-box containers). Because there is no law mandating that wine and spirits be placed on deposit, they may be added to municipal blue box programs voluntarily. Refillable and non-refillable beer containers are collected through a separate program administered and operated by Brewers Retail Inc. (The Beer Store). Alcoholic beverage containers, as well as any associated packaging, can be returned to 443 beer store locations, 113 breweries (beer containers only), 141 retail partner stores, 63 LCBO northern agency stores, 4 additional LCBO stores, and 115 empty bottle dealers (small independent depots contracted in more remote locations where beer retailers are not available), for a total of 879 redemption locations. TBS trucks collect these empty containers and back-haul them to various distribution centres where recyclables are sent to a processing facility for sorting, baling, and shipping to market. Refillable bottles are sent back to the brewers for washing and refill. Containers returned through Ontario's deposit- return system showed a total recycling rate of 89% for 2014-2015, while refillable beer bottles were returned at a rate of 98%. Recycling machine in a Montreal grocery store. * Quebec: Quebec's deposit-return system was established in 1984 and covers beer and carbonated soft drink containers. Deposits range from CAD$0.05¬¢ to $0.20 depending on the size, material and content of the container. Boissons Gazeuses Environnement (BGE) administers the program for non-refillable soft-drink containers on behalf of industry, while Recyc-Quebec oversees the beer container collection program. In 2014, the recycling rate for containers recovered via the deposit-return system was 78% (includes data for refillable bottles). * New Brunswick: This program was created in 1992 and covers all ready-to-drink, non-refillable beverage containers 5 l and under, including soft-drinks, beer, wine, spirits, flavoured waters, fruit juices, vegetable juices, and low alcohol drinks. Containers for milk and milk products (and substitutes) as well as processed apple cider are exempt. Encorp Atlantic Inc. is the stewardship agency responsible for managing the collection, transportation, and partial processing of non-alcoholic beverage containers on behalf of brand-owners, and New Brunswick Liquor (NB Liquor) is responsible for the collection of alcoholic beverage containers. Program oversight is the responsibility of the Department of Environment. New Brunswick's deposit-return program is somewhat unique in that it operates under a ‚Äúhalf-back‚Äù model where only half of the original deposit is refunded to the consumer when a container is returned for recycling. The unrefunded portion of the deposit is used to cover the costs of administering the program and part of it also goes towards the province's Environmental Trust Fund, which is used for environmental conservation and other provincial initiatives aimed at reducing waste. In 2014, New Brunswick's recycling rate for non-refillable containers was 73%. * Nova Scotia: Launched on April 1, 1996, Nova Scotia's deposit-return program applies to all ready- to-drink beverage containers excluding milk, milk products, soya milk, and rice beverages. Other containers that are exempt from the program are certain meal replacements, formulated liquid diets, foods for very low energy diets, thickened juices, baby formulas, concentrates, and non-alcoholic beverages in containers of 5 l or more. The organization responsible for managing the program is DivertNS (formerly the Resource Recovery Fund Board Inc.). Like New Brunswick's program, Nova Scotia's deposit-return system is based on a ‚Äúhalf- back‚Äù model where only half of the original deposit paid per container is refunded to the consumer. The non-refundable portion of the deposit is used as revenue by DivertNS to help pay for program costs. In 2014, the program collected 334 million non-refillable beverage containers for a recycling rate of 84%. * Prince Edward Island: The province's deposit-return system was launched on May 3, 2008 as a replacement to a law that had prohibited the sale of non-refillable soft drink containers. The program is overseen and administered by the Department of Environment, Energy, and Forestry and covers all ready-to-drink beverage containers up to 5 l, except those used for dairy products, milk substitutes, or nutritional supplements. Similar to the other Atlantic provinces, PEI's deposit-return system is based on a ‚Äúhalf-back‚Äù model where only 50% of the original deposit paid is refunded to the consumer when he/she returns the empty container to a depot. In 2014-2015, PEI had a non-refillable beverage container recycling rate of 80% and a total container recycling rate of 82%. * Yukon: Introduced in 1992, Yukon's deposit-return program covers all ready-to-drink beverage containers (glass, plastic, steel, aluminum, and Tetra Pak), excluding those containing milk and milk substitutes. The program is managed by the Department of Community Services and requires consumers to pay a surcharge on the purchase of certain beverage containers, which includes a refundable deposit and a non-refundable recycling fund fee (RFF). Upon return of the empty container to a depot or processor, a portion of the surcharge (the refundable deposit) is refunded to the consumer, while the non-refundable RFF is kept by the retailer and remitted to the territorial Recycling Fund, where unredeemed deposits also go. In 2014, Yukon had a non-refillable recycling rate of 82%. In May 2016, the Yukon government announced changes to the Beverage Container Regulation. These changes, which are expected to be implemented August 1, 2017, will affect the surcharges and refunds applicable to beverage containers including milk and milk substitutes and will simplify the regulation. Once the territory's new regulations kick in, all beverage containers will fall into two categories: (1) 750 ml and less, including all milk & milk substitutes (surcharge 10 cents, refund 5 cents), and (2) 750 ml and more (surcharge 35 cents, refund 25 cents). * Northwest Territories: Launched on November 1, 2005, Northwest Territories‚Äô deposit-return program covers all ready-to-serve beverage containers made of glass, plastics, aluminum, bi-metal, and mixed materials, including juice, milk and liquid milk products (added February 2010), soda, water, beer, wine, liquor and other alcoholic beverages. Excluded from the program are containers for infant formula; containers for milk and liquid milk products smaller than 30 ml; and powder milk. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DNR) is responsible for administering the program. Similar to Yukon's program, the total surcharge per container includes a refundable deposit and a non-refundable handling fee. Whereas the refundable deposit is returned to the consumer when they return the beverage container to a depot, the non- refundable handing fee is put into the Environment Fund and is used to help cover program costs. In fiscal 2014, approximately 26 million beverage containers were returned for reuse or recycling, translating into an overall recycling rate of 89%. =United States= There are currently 10 states in the United States with the container deposit legislation. * California: Enacted in 1981 and operated by CalRecycle, California's bottle bill charges a US$0.05 refundable deposit on containers less than , and US$0.10 for containers or greater. * Connecticut: Connecticut's bottle bill was introduced in 1980, but was expanded in 2009 to include bottled water. The deposit is the same for all container types and is US$0.05. * Hawaii: Hawaii's bottle bill has been in place since 2005 and is government-operated. A refundable deposit of US$0.05 is charged on all plastic (PET, HDPE), metal, bi-metal, and glass beverage containers 2 l or less, except for milk and dairy products. In 2015, the system achieved a total return rate of 68% * Iowa: Introduced in 1979,Roth, Evan (June 9, 1985). \\"Handling Called Messy: Iowa Cleaner; Bottle Law Praised\\". Omaha World-Herald (Omaha, Nebraska). The deposit is uniform across beverage categories and is currently US$0.05. Unredeemed funds are kept by beverage distributors and it has been found to be highly profitable to them. * Maine: Established in 1978 after a ballot initiative,Merry, George B. (January 27, 1981). \\"New 'bottle bills' face crucial test in months ahead\\". The Christian Science Monitor. p. 7. Maine's bottle bill charges a US$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass containers and US$0.15 for most liquor and wine bottles. * Massachusetts: The state's bottle bill was effective as of January 17, 1983.Merry, George B. (November 18, 1981). \\"Bay State places 'nickel-and-dime' bounty on all beverage containers\\". The Christian Science Monitor. p. 9. The deposit levied is US$0.05. * Michigan: Implemented in 1978, Michigan's bottle bill charges a US$0.10 deposit on plastic, metal, glass, and paper containers less than 1 gallon. * New York: New York's bottle bill has been in place since January 12, 1983.\\"New York stores carry the (empty) can\\". Financial Times (London, United Kingdom). September 17, 1983. p. 17. New York charges a US$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass containers 3.78 l or less. * Oregon: Oregon Bottle Bill has been in effect since 1972 and it is the first state in the United States to have a container deposit legislation. The deposit/refund value is uniformly 10 cents per applicable container. The deposit is held by the beverage industry cooperative and they keep all the unclaimed deposit. * Vermont: Implemented in 1973, Vermont's bottle bill charges a US$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass beer, wine coolers and other malt beverages, soft drinks and other carbonated beverage containers. Most liquor and spirits bottles are charged a deposit of US$0.15. States that formerly had can deposit regulation: * Delaware (5¬¢), introduced 1982, abolished 2009, replaced by Universal Recycling law. AsiaJapan= The container deposit legislation, as a monetary approach to the garbage/recycling problem, has never caught on in Japan. However, under increasingly ever stricter sorting rules announced by each town or city, garbage is meticulously sorted into kitchen garbage, newspapers/books, metal cans (washed)/plastic bottles (rinsed), garden weeds, etc. in each neighborhood for pickup by collection cars, usually on different days notified by the local government. Australia and OceaniaAustralia= Reverse container vending machine in Kooringal, New South Wales In the days when bottles were washed and re-used, drinks manufacturers paid for the return of their (proprietary) containers, but with the advent of single-use containers great savings were possible, leaving their disposal as the consumer's responsibility. While a national scheme has been repeatedly delayed largely due to threats from the beverage industry of multi-million dollar advertisements against politicians who support it and earlier disagreements between states, there has been a growing momentum of state-based operated container deposit schemes (CDS). All states have implemented or will introduce a state-based container deposit scheme operating by 2023, with Victoria the final jurisdiction to support such a scheme. With 8 billion beverage containers landfilled or littered every year in Australia, proponents argue that it is the most effective method to reduce such litter; and improve recycling above that achieved by kerbside. It also has many co-benefits such as funds for charities and several thousand new jobs, that cannot be achieved by other approaches. * The state of South Australia charges a refundable deposit of AUD 10 cents per drinks carton, can or bottle (only containers marked as eligible for refund; does not include wine & spirits bottles, milk cartons, or concentrated/and or vegetable juice intended to be diluted before consumption). This has been in place since 1977. The overall return rate is 79.9%. * Northern Territory introduced a container deposit scheme in 2012. A 10-cent (AUD) refundable deposit is charged on all beverage containers with the exception of unflavoured milk, soy milk, cordial bottles (undiluted), concentrated fruit/vegetable juice intended to be diluted before consumption, and still or sparkling wine (in glass bottles). Unredeemed deposits remain with the producer/filler. In 2015-2016, the system achieved a total return rate of 54%. * The state of New South Wales (the most populated state, with 7.5 million residents) announced that it would be adopting a 10-cent (AUD) deposit scheme, which commenced on December 1, 2017. The program has achieved a return rate of 69%. * On July 22, 2016, the Queensland government announced that the state would introduce a container deposit scheme which commenced on November 1, 2018. A 10 cent (AUD) refund is provided for empty drink containers between 150 ml and 3 l. * The state of Western Australia has announced the start date of a state-based scheme commencing in 2020. The scheme will apply to certain empty drink containers ranging in size from 150 ml to 3 l and will exclude domestically consumed drink containers such as wine and spirit bottles, milk and juice containers. The amount of the deposit/refund will be AUD 10-cents. * Tasmania has, as of June 2019 announced it will have a scheme in place by 2022. * Victoria announced it will introduce a scheme by 2023 as part of its updated recycling and waste management policies. =Fiji= The United Nations Development Programme had funded a feasibility study to look at the possibility of establishing a deposit-return system in Fiji, building on the experience gained from their successful projects in Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia. In 2011, the Fijian Government approved the Environment Management Waste Disposal and Recycling Amendment Regulations 2011, and the Environment Management Container Deposit Regulations 2011. The Regulations provide the legal framework for the introduction of a container deposit and refund system, allowing beverage producers and importers to adjust pricing and accommodate deposits. The Regulations will also allow the Department of Environment to register and establish the Managing Agency that will administer Fiji's container deposit system, and establish a revolving fund account to receive all deposits paid by producers for all beverages sold. No further details are available. =New Zealand= New Zealand had no container-deposit legislation until 2008 when the Waste Minimisation Act 2008 passed into law. The Act has provision for product stewardship of which container-deposit legislation is the most familiar type. there is no widespread deposits available on containers with some beer bottles being a notable exception. Europe Belgium = Smaller beer bottles (250 or 330 mL) carry a ‚Ç¨0.10 deposit, and larger ones (750 mL or 1 L) a ‚Ç¨0.20 one. Some fruit-juice bottles, such as those sold by Oxfam Wereldwinkels/Magasins du Monde, carry a ‚Ç¨0.30 deposit. Some hard plastic milk and orange juice bottles such as those sold by Delhaize carry a ‚Ç¨0.20 deposit. In April 2019 the Brussels Capital Region started a project to test out an expansion of the system to cans, which hold a ‚Ç¨0.05 deposit. After the 2019 Belgian regional elections the new Brussels regional government decided to introduce the deposit system for cans, as well as for plastic bottles. = Croatia = Since 2006, a refundable deposit of 0.5 HRK (Croatian Kuna) has been levied on non-refillable containers (except dairy products) with minimum volume of 200 ml. Retailers over 200 m¬≤ are obliged to take-back containers. Collection is mostly manual, although some collection occurs with reverse vending machines. Retailers must sort containers by material type (PET bottles, aluminum/steel cans, and glass bottles). The scheme is government operated and there is a collection target of 95%. In 2015, the scheme recovered up to 90% of all non-refillable containers placed on the Croatian market. = Czech Republic = In the Czech Republic most beer is sold in returnable glass bottles that carry a CZK 3 deposit. These bottles are collected by shops and supermarkets. Reverse vending machines have mostly replaced human staff. There is also a CZK 100 deposit on plastic beer crates with a 20 bottle capacity. Most reverse vending machines accept an entire crate full of empty bottles, returning CZK 160. There is no deposit on other containers. =Denmark= In Denmark, the first national deposit- return system was introduced in 1922 when the Danish breweries agreed on a standardized glass bottle for beer and carbonized drinks due to the limited resources available during and just after World War I. In 1991 and 1993 this was expanded to also include plastic bottles. Aluminium beverage cans were forbidden from 1982 to 2002. However, this ban violated European Union law and to be in compliance Denmark introduced a new legislation in 2002 with a deposit scheme that covered aluminium cans. The law covers beer (alcohol content >0.5% by volume), carbonated soft drinks (alcohol content 0-0.5%), energy drinks, mineral water, iced tea, ready-to-drink beverages, and mixer products (alcohol content 0.5%-10%); juice and uncarbonated soft drinks were added to the deposit scheme in 2019-2020. Excluded from the scheme are wine and spirits (alcohol content >10%), products containing milk and containers larger than 20 liters. The deposit levels are as follows: * Disposable aluminium and glass containers under 1 l and refillable glass bottles under 0.5 l: . * Disposable and refillable plastic containers under 1 l: . * Metal and plastic containers equal to or greater than 1 l or refillable glass bottles over 0.5 l: . The deposit system operator is Dansk Retursystem A/S, a private non-profit organization. Most collection (95%) is done automatically using reverse vending machines, but some (5%) is done manually. In 2019, the system achieved a total return rate of 92%. = Estonia = In Estonia there is a universal deposit and recycling system since 2005 for one-time and refillable containers. This includes soft drinks, water, beer, cider, juice, juice concentrates, nectars, and low-ethanol alcoholic beverages (up to 6% volume). The deposit is ‚Ç¨0.10 on most metal, plastic, and glass beverage containers. It does not include strong alcoholic beverages, such as wine or vodka, syrup bottles, glass jars, or Tetra Paks. Since 2019, the system has been set to also accept some out-of-system bottles within accepted categories, though people will not receive a deposit for those. The system is operated by Eesti Pandipakend O√ú, which is a producer responsibility organization representing the Estonian Association of Brewers, the Association of Producers of Soft Drinks, the Association of Importers of Soft Drinks and Beer, and the Estonian Retailers Association. In 2015, 90% of all PET bottles, 70% of all aluminum cans and 87% of all glass bottles sold in Estonia were returned for recycling and/or reuse. The overall return rate was 82.3%. =Finland= Deposit system was first introduced to Finland in 1952 along with summer Olympic Games which brought Coca-Cola to the country ‚Äì in glass bottles. In the 1980s some re-usable and durable plastic bottles were included in the deposit system. Deposits were introduced on aluminum cans in 1996, on PET bottles in 2008, and on recycled glass bottles in 2012. Almost all soft drinks are covered by the program, in addition to water, beer, cider, long drinks, sport drinks, juice, and liquor/spirits/wine sold by Alko. Milk and other products packed in liquid packaging board are exempt. The system is administered by Suomen palautuspakkaus Oy (abbr. Palpa), which is a private consortium of beverage importers and manufacturers. In 2016, aluminum cans were recovered at a rate of 96%, PET bottles 92%, and one-way glass 88%. The deposit values for these containers are as follows: * Plastic <0.5 l: ‚Ç¨0.10 * Plastic 0.5‚Äì1 l: ‚Ç¨0.20 * Plastic >1 l: ‚Ç¨0.40 * Metal: ‚Ç¨0.15 * Glass: ‚Ç¨0.10 The scheme is, in technical sense, voluntary and Palpa does not hold a legal monopoly for container deposits systems. Lidl has its own levy system for Lidl bottles. Those beverage containers that do not belong to a container deposit system are levied an excise tax of ‚Ç¨0.51/L, regardless of the container size.Laki er√§iden juomapakkausten valmisteverosta (1037/2004). Finlex.fi. Retrieved on 2015-08-30. . The tax is so high that essentially all beverage manufacturers and importers opt to join the Palpa system instead of paying the excise tax.Laura Descombes, Erkka Ryyn√§nen ja Mari Saario. Pantti on arvostettu br√§ndi . J√§teplus 42/2014. J√§tehuoltoyhdistys ry. Retrieved on 2015-08-30. . =Germany= Reverse vending machine in an Aldi supermarket in Germany. In Germany, the deposit legislation covers plastic, aluminum, and glass containers for water, beer, mixed drinks containing beer, carbonated/non-carbonated soft drinks, and mixed alcoholic drinks. Excluded from the program are containers for fruit and vegetable juice, milk products, wine, spirits, liquors, and certain dietary drinks. Also excluded are containers smaller than 100 ml and larger than 3 l. There is separate legislation (known as Einwegpfand or single-use deposit) for non-reusable containers, mostly plastic bottles and aluminium cans, distinct from (Mehrwegpfand reusable deposit) for reusable containers, mostly glass. A Einwegpfand deposit system was passed in 2002, and was implemented on 1 January 2003. However, its implementation was fought by lobby groups of German bottling industry and retailers. This fight also included trials at the Federal Administrative Court of Germany and the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, but all trials were won by the German federal government.\\"Ruling of the Constitutional Court of Germany\\" The deposit charge for Einwegpfand containers is required to be relatively high. As of October 2016, the standard deposit for these is ‚Ç¨0.25. By comparison, the deposit for reusable containers (mostly glass bottles) is usually between 8 and 15 cents. The usual rates are locally ‚Ç¨0.02 for some wine bottles, ‚Ç¨0.08 for beer bottles up to 0.5 L, and ‚Ç¨0.15 for beer bottles with flip-top closures, beer bottles over 0.5 L and other bottles (mostly water and soft-drinks, lesser fruit drinks, milk, cream, yoghurt). Some bottles have an even higher deposit. Bottle crates have a deposit of ‚Ç¨1.50. The reasoning behind the price discrepancy was to keep environmentally-harmful plastics from ending up as litter or in the regular garbage system. It was also meant to make non-reusable beverage containers more expensive and thus, less attractive. German plastic bottle with an Einwegpfand sign Retailers are only obliged to take back the material fractions that they sell. The deposit for refillable bottles is not defined by law. Germany's collection system is 80% automated and 20% manual. Most supermarkets in Germany have a reverse vending machine that is designed to be used by customers and which scans \\"Pfand\\" returns and prints a receipt for the total value of the refund which can be exchanged for cash or put towards the cost of future purchases. Supermarkets near the Danish border have established a scheme, where Scandinavian residents are exempt from \\"Pfand\\", by signing an \\"Export declaration\\" and providing that cans are exported within 24 hours and the contents are not consumed within Germany. The system has successfully encouraged the recycling of Einwegpfand containers. Between 97 and 99% of non- reusable bottles are returned, and recycling rates for cans are around 99%. On the other hand, the percentage of containers being sold that are reusable has actually decreased from about 80% to below 50% since the system was established. Since manufacturers keep the deposit on any unreturned containers, they are effectively incentivized to produce Einwegpfand containers which yield a higher profit if they are not returned. One estimate suggests they have earned ‚Ç¨3bn on unreturned bottles since the system was introduced. At any given time, an estimated 2 billion beer bottles are in circulation in Germany, each of which sees an average of 36 reuses. =Hungary= In Hungary, beer, wine and standardized liquor bottles carry a deposit on them, which was liberalized in the recent past. Beer bottles have 25 forints on them, but for wine glasses and for liquor bottles, the sum is decided by the trader, which people can exploit by buying a drink in a certain retailer and bringing the bottle back to its rival who have a bigger deposit on it. PET bottles and metal beverage containers are taken back only by some super- and hypermarkets, such as Lidl, Auchan, Tesco, Interspar. They all use reverse vending machines to collect them: for bottles and in most places for the PET bottles they use a Wincor-Nixdorf or a Tomra machine, while ALU cans are collected by the Hungarian ALU-press machine. Its advantage is that it accepts flattened or pressed cans as well, and it crushes them with a pressing machine, thus improving the storage capacity of the machine. The containers' prices - 2 forints/ALU can and 1 forint/PET bottle - do not widely motivate people to revend these containers. =Iceland= Iceland has had a deposit system on a national scale for a wide range of containers (plastic, aluminum, and glass) since 1989. All ready-to-drink beverages, wine, and liquor are included in the program. Milk, milk products, and juice extracts are excluded. The deposit is the same for all bottles and cans, ISK 16. The recycling rate per product is approximately 90% aluminum, 87% PET, and 83% glass. =Lithuania= Lithuania implemented container deposit legislation for single-use cans and bottles in February 2016. Lithuania's program is comprehensive and charges a deposit on nearly all types of beverage containers, including those made of plastic, metal, and glass 0.1 l to 3 l. The deposit is applicable to beer and beer cocktails; cider and other fermented beverages; mixed alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages; all types of water; juice and nectars (sold in glass, plastic, and metal packaging); and fruit wines and wine-product cocktails sold in plastic and metal packaging. Milk, wine, and spirits are exempt. The deposit is the same for all containers and is ‚Ç¨0.10 per bottle/can, and most collection is done using reverse vending machines. Lithuania's deposit return system is operated by U≈æstato Sistemos Administratorius (USAD). Container return rates for plastic bottles were 34% before the deposit scheme, 74.3% at end of 2016, 91.9% at end of 2017, and 93% in 2018. =Netherlands= Under the current deposit-return scheme, large polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles greater than 1 l are subject to a ‚Ç¨0.25 deposit, but only those for soft drinks and water. All other beverage types, such as medical drinks, wine, spirits, etc., are excluded. The system, which is operated by Stichting Retourverpakkingen NL, is mostly automated collection (89%) with only 11% of returns being done manually. Beer bottles carry a ‚Ç¨0.10 deposit, and beer crates ‚Ç¨1.50. In 2014, the Netherlands' deposit system recovered 95% of the containers covered by the program. On 24 April 2020, the State Secretary for Infrastructure and Water Management Stientje van Veldhoven announced that plastic bottles smaller than 1 l will be subject to a ‚Ç¨0.15 deposit, starting on 1 July 2021. Beverage cans will be subject to a deposit in 2022 if the industry doesn't succeed to reduce the presence of cans in the environment with 70% in 2021. Dutch environmental organisations acclaimed the decision. Coca-Cola Netherlands stated that it supports the deposit on small plastic bottles. =Norway= A Tomra reverse vending machine in Hammerfest, Norway Automated recycling of bottles has been in use since the 1970s. Aluminum and steel beverage cans had a 5,60 kr surtax in Norway up until the end of the 20th century. In 1999, a container deposit legislation was passed, which also abolished this regulation. Today, these are the following container deposits in Norway: * Cans and plastic bottles up to 0.5 L: 2.00 krone * Cans and plastic bottles over 0.5 L: 3 kr * Bottle crates are also reverse vended. ** As of September 2018 container deposit legislation were removed from glass bottles. In 2018 the rates were increased to 2 NOK (formerly 1 NOK) and 3 NOK (previously 2.50 NOK) due to inflation and the discontinuation of the 50-√∏re coin. Infinitum AS (formerly Norsk Resirk A/S) is responsible for operating the national recycling scheme for non-refillable plastic bottles and beverage cans in Norway. The non-profit corporation was founded in 1999 and is owned by companies and organizations in the beverage industry and food trading. The Norwegian system works in such a way that the excise tax decreases as the returns increases, meaning for example that 90 per cent returns for cans translates into a 90 per cent discount on the excise tax. This again allows drink products to be sold at lower prices. In 2014, 95.4% of PET bottles and 96.6% of all drink cans in Norway were returned under the scheme. Deposits on drink containers have a long history in Norway, starting with deposits on beer bottles in 1902. The deposit back then was 0.06 kr (3.30 kr in 2006 currency value). This deposit arrangement was later expanded to include soft drink bottles. Up until 1 January 2001, the Vinmonopolet government wine and spirits monopoly chain had deposits on products made by the company itself, this did not include imported products. All sellers of deposit marked drinking containers are required by law to accept returns of empty containers for cash. As of 2016, drink containers can be returned and deposits retrieved at over 15,000 establishments in Norway. The collection system is 95% automated (using reverse vending machines) and only 5% manual. Most reverse vending machines in Norway are manufactured by Tomra Systems ASA. =Sweden= Deposit symbol of the old Swedish 50 √∂re 33-cl aluminium can In Sweden, there are deposits on nearly all ready-to-serve beverages, including beer, soft drinks, cider, and bottled water. Since 2015, syrup producers can voluntarily join the deposit system. Since 2017 juice producers are also allowed to join. The deposit values are as follows: * Metal: SEK 1 * Plastic < 1 l: SEK 1 * Plastic > 1 l: SEK 2 * Glass 33 cl: SEK 0,60, an empty red bottle crate for 20 bottles has a SEK 22,40 deposit. * Glass 50 cl: SEK 0,90, an empty blue bottle crate for 15 bottles has a SEK 28,00 deposit. AB Svenska Returpack ()Pantamera is responsible for the deposit system for aluminium cans and PET bottles. The aluminium cans have had a deposit since 1984, and PET bottles since 1994. Svensk Glas√Ötervinning AB is responsible for the deposit system of glass bottles. A glass bottle recycling system was introduced in 1884 and the bottles were first standardized in 1885. Until 1998, the hard alcohol and wine bottles sold at Systembolaget ‚Äî the government owned alcohol retail monopoly ‚Äî had a deposit as well, but due to the deregulation of the Systembolaget's suppliers, the former sole supplier V&S; Group dropped the deposit on their bottles due to the restricted bottle shapes giving V&S; a disadvantage compared to the competitors. The bottles could be returned and deposit refunded until early 1999 at Systembolaget. The legislation regarding container deposit systems was updated so that from January 1, 2006, containers from other plastics and metals, e.g., steel cans, can be included in the deposit systems. The law also makes it illegal in Sweden to sell consumption-ready beverages in containers that are not part of an authorized Swedish container deposit system, with the exception of beverages that mainly consist of dairy products or vegetable, fruit, or berry juice. However, private importation from (mainly Eastern European) countries without deposit occurs by vendors that thus compete with a somewhat lower customer price. The recycling of these contraband cans has not been seen as a problem, but Returpack made a campaign in 2010 offering 0.10 krona for each imported can (without deposit) to the benefit of WWF, retrieving 17 million cans. In 2011, a similar campaign was repeated, retrieving almost 18 million cans. Non-deposit glass containers are collected in large glass garbage bins, for clear or coloured glass, placed centrally in most urban areas. The 1.5 L refillable PET bottle with a deposit of 4.00 kr has been discontinued, and has been replaced by the 1.5 L non-refillable PET bottle. The last day for returning bottles made by Spendrups for deposit was 30 June 2007, and the last day for bottles made by Coca-Cola Sweden was 30 June 2008. Although Sweden is one of the leading countries in recycling of beverage containers, Returpack uses TV commercials to promote more recycling. Commercials have been made with well-known melodies sung, like \\"Guantanamera\\" and \\"Pata pata\\"‚Äîsounding like Returpack's slogan \\"panta mera\\" (i.e., \\"recycle more\\"). In 2016, the overall recycling rate was 84.9% for both aluminium cans and PET bottles, which translates to 177 packages per person in Sweden. = Switzerland = In Switzerland, there is a government ruling that 75% of containers must be returned, otherwise a deposit system may be introduced. = United Kingdom = Until the turn of the 21st century, most British bottled beer was sold (whether in off-licences or pubs) in standard quart, pint, half-pint or third- pint (nip) bottles, although some brewers preferred their own distinctive designs. The standard deposit was 7pence (p) for a pint bottle and 5p for a half-pint. However, in the absence of legislation, and given the switch from pub to supermarket sales, and from Imperial to metric measures, the industry has now entirely abandoned refillable bottles. Beer casks sold for the home or party consumption of draught beer are usually also loaned out against a deposit which may run to several tens of pounds. England  In England, in January 2017, ministers were reported to be considering a 10p or 20p refundable deposit on plastic bottles and containers after Green Party co- leader Caroline Lucas had voiced her support of such a scheme at the end of 2016. As of February 2017, the idea of a plastic bottle levy was unlikely as the government rejected the deposit scheme proposal. In March 2018, the UK government announced plans to introduce a deposit return scheme in England for drinks containers. Northern Ireland  As of June 2015, Northern Ireland had been considering a drinks deposit scheme, following the publication of a feasibility study for a deposit return scheme for drinks containers in Scotland. It has yet to implement such a scheme.  Scotland  In Scotland, some Barr products in 750 mL glass bottles, had a 30p container deposit although this was discontinued in August 2015. Some Tesco stores have reverse vending machines which pay p per aluminium can (equivalent value in Tesco Clubcard Points). Furthermore, the landmark Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 passed by the Scottish Parliament contains within it powers for Scottish ministers to implement a national scheme.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/12/part/5/crossheading/deposit- and-return As of April 2017, a Holyrood motion supporting the idea of a small deposit on all drinks containers was signed by 66 MSPs, including member from every party. In May 2015, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland (APRS) published Scottish polling which revealed overwhelming support for deposit-return. The figures showed that 78.8% of those who expressed a view supported this approach for Scotland, while just 8.5% opposed it. Several companies, most notably large drinks corporations like Coca-Cola, are known to have lobbied against the introduction of a national deposit scheme. Leaked documents reveal that in Europe, Coca-Cola had identified deposit programs as a threat and they were planning to fight back. But in February 2017, the drinks company unexpectedly announced its support for a deposit-return program in Scotland, and in a statement to the Independent, Coca-Cola UK stated: \\"We have embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy to understand what role we can play in unlocking the full potential of a circular economy in Great Britain.\\" On September 5, 2017, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that a deposit-system would be implemented as a means to tackle the rising tide of waste. In March 2020 it was announced that the launch date would be delayed to July 2022. Wales As of March 2018, Welsh ministers are working on a plan to introduce a deposit return scheme. Middle EastIsrael= In Israel, there is a 0.30-shekel (‚Ç™) deposit on beverage containers over 100 ml and under 5 l, except for dairy products. The system is operated by the ELA Recycling Corporation, a private non-profit organization owned by Israel's beverage manufacturers.

The script is based on a novel by Ray Gaulden and was written by Marguerite Roberts, who also wrote the screenplay of True Grit for Hathaway the following year. Plot In 1880, a gambler in the small town of Rincon, 100 miles from Denver, Colorado is caught cheating at a five-card stud poker game. The players, led by the volatile Nick Evers, take the cheating gambler to hang him. One of the players, Van Morgan, tries to prevent the others from administering frontier justice, but is unable to stop the man's lynching. Morgan leaves town, but later returns when he hears that a couple of the other players from that ill-fated game have become victims of grisly murders. The town has a new resident, a stern and somewhat edgy Colt .45-carrying Baptist preacher named Reverend Rudd. As more members of the lynch mob are killed off one by one, it becomes clear that someone is taking revenge, and it is up to Morgan to solve the mystery. Finally, only he is left. He discovers the identity of the killer just in time. Cast *Dean Martin as Van Morgan *Robert Mitchum as The Rev.

He was a first round draft choice out of Ohio State University, and was the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in . College career Born and raised in Brooklyn in New York City, Brockington played halfback and fullback for the Ohio State Buckeyes from 1968 to 1970. He was one of the so-called Super Sophomores who led the Buckeyes to an undefeated season and a consensus national championship in 1968. Brockington and the other Super Sophomores finished their college careers with a record Brockington played left halfback in 1968 and 1969, used primarily as a blocker for fullback Jim Otis and quarterback In 1970, Brockington moved to the fullback position and was the featured running back in head coach Woody Hayes' offense. Brockington finished his senior season with 1,142 rushing yards, which was at the time an Ohio State single-season record; he also scored 17 rushing touchdowns that season. Brockington was selected onto the Buckeyes' All-Century Team in 2000, and was elected into the Varsity O Hall of Fame in 2002. Professional career Brockington was the ninth overall selection in the 1971 NFL Draft, after Jim Plunkett, Dan Pastorini, Archie Manning, and John Riggins, and ahead of Jack Tatum, Jack Youngblood, Jack Ham and Dan Dierdorf.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/draft.htm Brockington became the first NFL player to ever rush for 1,000 or more yards in each of his first three seasons. In his rookie year of 1971 with the Green Bay Packers, Brockington was named NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press, rushing for 1,105 yards and a 5.1 YPC in 14 games. Brockington was named All-Pro in , 2nd Team All-Pro in and All-NFC in . Brockington was also selected to three consecutive Pro Bowls (1971‚Äì1973).https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrocJo00.htm His first running mate in the Green Bay backfield was sixth-year halfback Donny Anderson, another Packer first round draft choice, who was traded the following offseason to the St. Louis Cardinals for running back MacArthur Lane. Together, Brockington and Lane formed a dynamic running duo in the backfield, carrying the Packers offense between 1972 and 1974. The Packers won the NFC Central division in 1972 for their first playoff berth in five years. With a running style based on his great strength, Brockington epitomized the power running back ‚Äì a player who preferred to break tackles and run over defenders rather than run away from them. He was one of the first running backs to combine brute force with speed. Brockington's success was short- lived; after eclipsing 1,000 yards rushing during each of his first three seasons, he ran for 883 yards in 1974 (with a career-high 43 receptions for 314 yards), but dipped to only 434 yards rushing on 3.0 YPC in 1975 under new head coach Bart Starr. This was the result of typical wear-and-tear, the trade of Lane in July 1975 and changes in the Packers' playbook that did not take advantage of Brockington's abilities. In 1976, he had 406 yards rushing with 3.5 YPC. After the first game of the 1977 season, Brockington was released by the Signed by the struggling Kansas City Chiefs three weeks he appeared in ten games for them and retired following the season. John Brockington Foundation Established in 2002 after receiving a kidney transplant from his future wife Diane Scott, Brockington created http://www.nndb.com/people/927/000115582/ the John Brockington Foundation to aid others impacted by kidney disease.

It is the only member of the genus Rollulus. This small partridge is a resident breeder in lowland rainforests in south Burma, south Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo. Its nest is a ground scrape lined with leaves, which is concealed under a heap of leaf litter. Five or six white eggs are incubated for 18 days. Unusually for a galliform species, the young are fed bill-to-bill by both parents instead of pecking from the ground, and although precocial, they roost in the nest while small. The crested partridge is a rotund short-tailed bird, in length, with the male marginally larger than the female. Both sexes have a scarlet patch of bare skin around the eye and red legs without a spur or hind toe. The male is metallic green above with glossy dark blue underparts and a brownish wing panel. The head is adorned with a tall red crest, a white forehead spot and black frontal bristles. The female has pea-green body plumage apart from the brown wing coverts. She has a slate-grey head with the bristles but no spot or crest. The bill is all-dark. Young birds are duller versions of the adult of the same sex. The song is a mournful whistled si-ul. The crested partridge is usually seen singly or in pairs as it uses its feet to probe the forest floor for fruit, seeds and invertebrates.\\"Crested Wood Partridge Fact Sheet, Lincoln Park Zoo\\" When disturbed, it prefers to run but if necessary it flies a short distance on its rounded wings. There is some concern about the effect of habitat destruction on this bird, especially with regard to logging. However, it seems to be somewhat more adaptable than other southeast Asian pheasants. The crested wood partridge is evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix III of CITES.

The music, scored for a thirteen-member chamber orchestra, was created upon commission of the choreographer and dancer Martha Graham with funds from the Coolidge Foundation. It was premiered on Monday, October 30, 1944 at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., with Martha Graham dancing the lead role. The set was designed by the American sculptor Isamu Noguchi. Copland was awarded the 1945 Pulitzer Prize for Music for his achievement. Music In 1942, Martha Graham and Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge commissioned Copland to write a ballet with \\"an American theme\\". Copland did the bulk of the work in 1943/44, and the work was premiered at the Library of Congress on Oct. 30, 1944, with Graham dancing the lead role. In 1945, Copland was commissioned by conductor Artur Rodzinski to rearrange the ballet as an orchestral suite, preserving most of the music. Copland cut about 10 minutes from the original 13-instrument score to make the suite. From the preface in the original Boosey & Hawkes publication of the suite: > The original scoring called for a chamber ensemble of thirteen instruments. > The present arrangement for symphony orchestra was made by the composer in > the Spring of 1945. It is a condensed version of the ballet, retaining all > essential features but omitting those sections in which the interest is > primarily choreographic. The Orchestral Suite from 1945 was first recorded by Serge Koussevitzky with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1954, Eugene Ormandy asked Copland to expand the orchestration for the full score of the ballet. In 1972, Boosey & Hawkes published a version of the suite using the scoring of the original ballet. Thus there are four versions of Appalachian Spring, dating from 1944 (13-player complete), 1945 (orchestral suite), 1954 (orchestral complete) and 1972 (13-player suite). The 1944 version was recorded in 1973 by Copland himself directing the Columbia Chamber Orchestra, and in 1991 by Hugh Wolff with the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra for Teldec. The 1954 version was recorded by Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra for RCA Victor in May 1999. The original ballet and the orchestral suite were well received. The latter was credited as more important in popularizing the composer. Originally, Copland did not have a title for the work, referring to it simply as \\"Ballet for Martha\\"‚Äîa title as simple and direct as the Shaker tune 'Tis the Gift to be Simple quoted in the music.Matthew Naughtin, Ballet Music, 2014, p. 147 Shortly before the premiere, Graham suggested Appalachian Spring, a phrase from a Hart Crane poem, \\"The Dance\\" from a collection of poems in his book \\"The Bridge.\\" > O Appalachian Spring! I gained the ledge; Steep, inaccessible smile that > eastward bends And northward reaches in that violet wedge Of Adirondacks! Because he composed the music without the benefit of knowing what the title was going to be, Copland was often amused when people told him he captured the beauty of the Appalachians in his music, a fact he alluded to in an interview with NPR's Fred Calland. Little known is that the word \\"spring\\" denotes a source of water in the Crane poem; however, the poem is a journey to meet springtime.  Instrumentation  The original 1944 version was scored for: *1 flute *1 clarinet in B *1 bassoon *piano *2 violin I *2 violin II *2 violas *2 cellos *1 double bass Ballet storyline The story tells of a spring celebration of the American pioneers of the 19th century, after building a new Pennsylvania farmhouse. Among the central characters are a bride, a groom, a pioneer woman, a preacher and his congregation. The L.A. Times provides a concise summary of the storyline in its transitions between the choreographed sequences stating: > Created in 1944, the ballet tells a simple story. A young farm couple > ruminate on their lives before getting married and setting up house in the > wilderness. An itinerant preacher delivers a sermon. An older pioneer woman > oversees the events with sympathy and wisdom. The newlyweds muse on their > future as night falls. In the course of the dance, Graham reveals the inner > lives of the four principal characters ‚Äì Wife, Husbandman, Pioneer Woman and > Preacher. She shows that the couple will face a future that will not be all > sweetness and light, but she also draws out the private and shared emotional > resources they will be able to bring to the challenges. Such is the power of > Graham's images, however, that this very particular story broadens out to > become a parable about Americans conquering a new land.Chris Pasles. > \\"Appalachian Spring: Martha's Ballet\\". Los Angeles Times. January 3, 1991. Form of the piece The orchestral suite is divided into eight sections. Copland describes each scene thus: # Very slowly. Introduction of the characters, one by one, in a suffused light. # Fast/Allegro. Sudden burst of unison strings in A major arpeggios starts the action. A sentiment both elated and religious gives the keynote to this scene. # Moderate/Moderato. Duo for the Bride and her Intended ‚Äì scene of tenderness and passion. # Quite fast. The Revivalist and his flock. Folksy feeling ‚Äì suggestions of square dances and country fiddlers. # Still faster/Subito Allegro. Solo dance of the Bride ‚Äì presentiment of motherhood. Extremes of joy and fear and wonder. # Very slowly (as at first). Transition scene to music reminiscent of the introduction. # Calm and flowing/Doppio Movimento. Scenes of daily activity for the Bride and her Farmer husband. There are five variations on a Shaker theme. The theme, sung by a solo clarinet, was taken from a collection of Shaker melodies compiled by Edward D. Andrews, and published under the title \\"The Gift to Be Simple.\\" The melody borrowed and used almost literally is called \\"Simple Gifts.\\" # Moderate. Coda/Moderato ‚Äì Coda. The Bride takes her place among her neighbors. At the end the couple are left \\"quiet and strong in their new house.\\" Muted strings intone a hushed prayerlike chorale passage. The close is reminiscent of the opening music.

The movements that do not appear in the orchestral suite occur mostly between the 7th and last movement as variations on the Shaker melody Simple Gifts (1848). The second variation provides a lyrical treatment in the low register while the third contrasts starkly in a fast staccato. The last two variations of this section use only a part of the folk tune, first an extraction treated as a pastoral variation and then as a majestic closing. In the ballet, but not the suite, there is an intermediary section that moves away from the folk tune preceding the final two variations. Shaker melody Copland used a Shaker song, \\"Simple Gifts\\", composed in 1848 and usually attributed to Elder Joseph Brackett. The song is often called, in the context of discussions of Appalachian Spring, \\"Shaker Melody\\", \\"Shaker Song\\", and the \\"Shaker Hymn\\". This same Shaker tune was used by Sydney Carter in a widely recognized hymn entitled \\"Lord of the Dance\\". Copland published independent arrangements of this section for band (1958) and orchestra (1967) titled Variations on a Shaker Melody. In popular culture For many years part of the seventh movement of the orchestral suite was used as the opening music to CBS Reports.David Shedden. \\"Today in Media History: Remembering the ‚ÄúCBS Reports‚Äù documentary 'Harvest of Shame'\\".

Supreme Court of India  Governor of Tamil Nadu  She later went on to become Governor of Tamil Nadu on 25 January 1997. Appointing her as the Governor of the TN and Justice Sukhdev Singh Kang, former Chief Justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court, as Governor of Kerala, the then President of India, Shankar Dayal Sharma said \\"Their experience of and insights into the working of the Constitution and the laws comprise valuable assets.\\" As the Governor of the state, she rejected the mercy petitions filed by the four condemned prisoners in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The prisoners had sent the mercy petitions to the Governor, pleading her to exercise her power under Article 161 of the Constitution (the Governor's power to grant pardon).  Controversy  She was embroiled in controversy when she gave a clean chit to the law and order situation in Tamil Nadu that prompted the ire of the Central government. The Minister for Law, Arun Jaitley asked for her resignation. Later she left her office as Governor of the state under controversial circumstances of her accepting of Jayalalithaa's of assembly majority after the elections and over the arrest of Karunanidhi, who pitched for her appointment four years ago. Jayalalitha defended the state Governor's decision to invite her to form the government. She said \\"She is a former supreme court judge. She herself is a legal expert. Nobody need teach her about law or the constitution. Her decision is not justiciable.\\" Jayalalitha's party had received the simple majority (131 seats out of total 234 seats in the Tamil Nadu Assembly) after elections in May 2001.Fathima Beevi, the then Governor of Tamil Nadu administered the oath of office to J Jayalalitha as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on 14 May 2001 in spite of the fact that Jayalalitha can not contest the election and would not be able to get herself elected by the people to the assembly within six months as per the constitution. There were a few Public Interest Litigations (PIL) filed in the Supreme Court questioning the validity of her appointment as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Fathima Beevi justified her decision by saying that the majority party in the state assembly had elected Jayalalitha as their leader. Fathima Beevi submitted her resignation after the Union Cabinet decided to recommend to the President to recall the Governor for having failed to discharge her constitutional obligation. The Centre was peeved with Ms Fathima Beevi for not having furnished an independent and objective assessment of the sequence of events after the arrest of the former Chief Minister, M. Karunanidhi, and the two Union Ministers, Murasoli Maran and T. R. Baalu. The Centre had accused her of toeing the official line verbatim. The then Andhra Pradesh Governor, Dr C. Rangarajan, took charge as the acting Governor of Tamil Nadu, following her resignation. Subsequently, the Supreme Court of India overturned her appointment of Jayalalithaa as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Referring to the case, the Court Bench ruled that \\"The Governor cannot, in the exercise of his/her discretion or otherwise, do anything that is contrary to the Constitution and the laws. Therefore, the Governor, having due regard to the Constitution and the laws, must decline to exercise the discretion in appointing as Chief Minister a non-member who was not qualified to become a member of the legislature.\\"  Other Duties As the Governor of the state she had also served as the Chancellor of Madras University. It was reported by university sources that the Vice-Chancellor, P.T. Manoharan, had decided to quit his office in the wake of the Chancellor allegedly withholding her approval to the Syndicate's decision to establish a new department for contemporary Tamil literature. She had also served as the Chairman of Kerala Commission for Backward Classes(1993) and member of National Human Rights Commission ( 1993). She received Hon. D Litt and Mahila Shiromani Award in 1990. She was also awarded Bharat Jyoti Award. The left parties also discussed the nomination of the prospects of Fathima Beevi as the President of India, during which the NDA Government proposed the name of Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam.

Mature females are long, and males . They have a distinct boss at the end of the snout, which resembles an earthenware pot known as a ghara, hence the name \\"gharial\\". The gharial is well adapted to catching fish because of its long, thin snout and 110 sharp, interlocking teeth. The gharial probably evolved in the northern Indian subcontinent. Fossil gharial remains were excavated in Pliocene deposits in the Sivalik Hills and the Narmada River valley. It currently inhabits rivers in the plains of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is the most thoroughly aquatic crocodilian, and leaves the water only for basking and building nests on moist sandbanks. Adults mate at the end of the cold season. Females congregate in spring to dig nests. They lay 20‚Äì95 eggs, and guard the nests and the young that hatch before the onset of the monsoon. The hatchlings stay and forage in shallow water during their first year, but move to sites with deeper water as they grow. The wild gharial population has declined drastically since the 1930s, and is limited to only 2% of its historical range today. Conservation programmes initiated in India and Nepal focused on reintroducing captive-bred gharials since the early 1980s. Loss of habitat because of sand mining and conversion to agriculture, depletion of fish resources and detrimental fishing methods continue to threaten the population. It has been listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2007. The oldest known depictions of the gharial are about 4,000 years old and were found in the Indus Valley. Hindus regard it as the vehicle of the river deity Ga·πÖgƒÅ. Local people living near rivers attributed mystical and healing powers to the gharial, and used some of its body parts as ingredients of indigenous medicine. Taxonomy Lacerta gangetica was the scientific name proposed by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789. Gmelin followed Carl Linnaeus who proposed Lacerta in 1758 to include other crocodiles and various lizards known at the time. The gharial was placed in the genus Crocodilus by subsequent naturalists: *C. gavial by Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in 1789. *C. longirostris by Johann Gottlob Theaenus Schneider in 1801. *C. arctirostris by Fran√ßois Marie Daudin in 1802. *Longirostres was a subgroup proposed by Georges Cuvier in 1807 for crocodiles with a long snout. He placed C. gangeticus with the type locality Ganges and C. tenuirostris without locality into this group. The generic name Gavialis was proposed by Nicolaus Michael Oppel in 1811 for crocodiles with a cylindrical-shaped back. He placed this genus in the family Crocodilini. Rhamphostoma was proposed by Johann Georg Wagler in 1830 who considered this genus to contain two species, Crocodilus gangeticus and C. tenuirostris. The family name Gavialidae was proposed by Arthur Adams in 1854 with Gavialis as the only genus in this family. Gavialis gangetica was the scientific name used by Albert G√ºnther in 1864 who considered L. gangetica, C. longirostris and C. tenuirostris as synonyms and Gavialis a monotypic taxon. John Edward Gray reviewed zoological specimens in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London. He also considered the gharial monotypic in 1869. He placed it in the family Gavialidae together with the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) because both have long, slender jaws and similar dentition. Evolution The evolution of the gharial and its relationship with and divergence from other crocodilians have been a subject of controversy. Some authors assumed that the gharial evolved earlier than the other crocodilians because of its distinct skull shape and dentition, indicating a more advanced level of specialisation. Others suggested that it evolved much later than other crocodilians because of its low levels of blood proteins. As it shares this trait with the false gharial, it was suggested that they form a sister group. In contrast, it was suggested that the gharial and all the other crocodilians form a sister group as the structure of its tail muscles is unique. Sequencing of a ribosomal segment of mitochondrial DNAs of gharial and false gharial revealed that they share 22 unique nucleotides, a similarity of 94%, supporting the view that they are sister taxa. Analyses of nuclear gene sequences of both species also support the view that they are sister taxa. Results of molecular genetic studies indicate that crocodilians genetically diverged from the pseudosuchians in the Jurassic about 150 million years ago (mya). Gavialidae is estimated to have diverged from Crocodylidae in the Late Cretaceous about 80 mya. The gharial probably diverged from the false gharial in the Eocene about 42 mya. Tip dating with the extinct Thoracosaurus indicates a divergence between the gharial and false gharial about 38 mya. The genus Gavialis probably originated in the region of India and Pakistan in the Early Miocene. Fossil gharial remains excavated in the Sivalik Hills of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh are dated to between the Pliocene and the Early Pleistocene. Fossil gharial remains were also found at two sites in the Ayeyarwady River valley in central Myanmar, which are dated to the Late Pleistocene. During the Quaternary, Gavialis dispersed as far as Java via the Siva‚ÄìMalayan route, which did not require saltwater crossings. Fossil remains of Gavialis bengawanicus found on Java were dated to the Early Pleistocene. G. bengawanicus fossils found in Thailand's Nakhon Ratchasima Province support the hypothesis of gharial dispersal through riverine systems. It represents the only valid extinct Gavialis species.  Phylogeny  The following phylogenetic tree has been suggested in 2012 for the relationship of the gharial: Characteristics The gharial is olive-coloured, with adults being darker than young, which have dark brown cross bands and speckles. Its back turns almost black at 20 years of age, but its belly is yellowish-white. It has four transverse rows of two scales on the neck, which continue along the back. Scutes on the head, neck and back form a single continuous plate composed of 21 to 22 transverse series, and four longitudinal series. Scutes on the back are bony, but softer and feebly keeled on the sides. The outer edges of the forearms, legs, and feet have crests jutting out; fingers and toes are partly webbed. Its snout is very long and narrow, widened at the end, and with 27 to 29 upper teeth and 25 or 26 lower teeth on each side. The front teeth are the largest. The first, second, and third lower jaw teeth fit into spaces in the upper jaw. The extremely long mandibular symphysis extends to the 23rd or 24th tooth. The snout of adult gharials is 3.5 times longer than the width of the skull's base. Because of this long snout the gharial is especially adapted to catching and eating fish. The nasal bones are rather short and widely spaced from the premaxillae. The jugal bone is raised. It becomes proportionally thicker with age. The gharial has a bite force of . Male gharials develop a hollow bulbous nasal protuberance at the tip of the snout upon reaching sexual maturity. This protuberance resembles an earthen pot known locally as \\"ghara\\". The male's ghara starts growing over the nostrils at an age of 11.5 years and measures about at an age of 15.5 years. It enables the males to emit a hissing sound that can be heard away. The gharial is the only living crocodilian with such visible sexual dimorphism. Female gharials reach sexual maturity at a body length of and grow up to . Males mature at a body length of at least and grow up to a length of . Adult males weigh about on average. Mature male gharials have larger skulls than females, exceeding a basal length of and a width of . A long gharial was killed in the Ghaghara River in Faizabad in August 1920. Male gharials with an alleged length of were sighted around the turn of the 20th century in Indian rivers. Distribution and habitat The gharial once thrived in all the major river systems of the northern Indian subcontinent, from the Indus River in Pakistan, the Ganges in India, the Brahmaputra River in northeastern India and Bangladesh to the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar. In the early 20th century, it was considered common in the Indus River and its Punjabi tributaries. By the early 1980s, it was almost extinct in the Indus. During surveys in 2008 and 2009, no gharial was sighted in the river. It was also present in India's Godavari River but was hunted to extinction between the late 1940s and the 1960s. It was considered extinct in the Koshi River since 1970. In the 1940s, it was numerous in the Barak River in Assam, which held big fish at the time including golden mahseer (Tor putitora). A few individuals were also sighted in tributaries of the Barak River in Assam, Mizoram and Manipur up to 1988, but surveys were not carried out. In 1927, a gharial was shot in the Shweli River in Myanmar, a tributary of the Ayeyawady River. This is the only authenticated record in the country attesting the survival of gharials into the 20th century. Whether gharials still live in the Shweli River today is possible but remained unclear in 2012. By 1976, its global range had decreased to only 2% of its historical range, and fewer than 200 gharials were estimated to survive. Since the early 1980s, the population has been reinforced with captive-bred gharials that were released into wild habitats in India and Nepal. In 2017, the global population was estimated to comprise at maximum 900 individuals, including about 600 mature adults in six major subpopulations along of river courses and another 50 mature adults in eight minor subpopulations along of river courses. In Nepal, small populations are present and slowly recovering in tributaries of the Ganges, such as the Narayani‚ÄìRapti river system in Chitwan National Park, and the Karnali‚ÄìBabai river system in Bardia National Park. In spring 2017, the Babai River was surveyed using an unmanned aerial vehicle, which detected 33 gharials on a stretch of . In India, gharial populations are present in the: *Ramganga River in Corbett National Park, where five gharials were recorded in 1974. Captive-bred gharials were released since the late 1970s. The population is breeding since 2008, and increased to about 42 adults by 2013. Most of them congregate along an long stretch of the Kalagarh Reservoir's shoreline. Surveys in 2015 revealed a population of 90 gharials including 59 breeding adults. *Ganges, where 494 gharials were released between 2009 and 2012 in Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. *Girwa River in Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary where the small breeding population was reinforced with captive reared gharials since 1979. A total of 909 gharials were released until 2006, but only 16 nesting females were recorded in the same year. In December 2008, 105 individuals were counted including 35 adults. In spring 2009, 27 nests were detected in seven sites. *Gandaki River downstream the Triveni barrage west of Valmiki Tiger Reserve and adjacent to Sohagi Barwa Sanctuary. The population increased from 15 gharials in 2010 to 54 individuals recorded in March 2015 on a stretch of . 35 of these gharials were wild-born. *Chambal River in National Chambal Sanctuary where 107 gharials were recorded in 1974. Captive-bred gharials were released since 1979, and the population increased to 1,095 gharials in 1992. Between December 2007 and March 2008, 111 gharials were found dead. A total of 948 gharials were counted during surveys in 2013 along the protected river stretch of . In 2017, this population was estimated at 617‚Äì761 mature individuals and more than 1250 individuals by two different survey teams; 411 nests were found. *Parbati River, a tributary of the Chambal River, where gharials started using a few sand banks since about 2015; 29 gharials were observed in 2016 and 251 hatchlings counted at two nesting sites in 2017. *Yamuna River where eight young gharials were detected in autumn 2012 near the confluence of the Ken and Yamuna Rivers. They were probably offspring of the breeding population in the Chambal River and had drifted downriver during monsoon floods. *Son River where 164 captive-reared gharials were released between 1981 and 2011. *Koshi River in Bihar where two gharials were sighted basking in late January 2019 during a survey targeting South Asian River Dolphins (Platanista gangetica) on a stretch of about . This is the first record of wild gharials in the river since the 1970s. *Mahanadi River in Odisha's Satkosia Gorge Sanctuary where about 700 gharials were released between 1977 and the early 1990s. During a 1.5 year long survey in 2005‚Äì2006, only one male and one female gharial were detected moving together and sharing sand banks in the river. Between 1979 and 1993, less than 20 individuals were sighted in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra River between Kaziranga National Park and Dibru-Saikhowa National Park. This population had declined due to commercial fishing, poaching, encroachment by local people in gharial breeding grounds and siltation of river beds following deforestation. In 1998, it was not considered to be viable. About 30 gharials were observed in small lakes and tributaries of the Brahmaputra River in Assam between 2004 and 2007. In Bangladesh, gharials were recorded in Padma, Jamuna, Mahananda and Brahmaputra rivers between 2000 and 2015. Behaviour and ecology The gharial is the most thoroughly aquatic crocodilian. It leaves the water only for basking on riverbanks. Being cold-blooded, it seeks to cool down during hot times and to warm up when ambient temperature is cool. Gharials bask daily in the cold season, foremost in the mornings, and prefer sandy and moist beaches. They change their basking pattern with increasing daily temperatures; they start basking earlier in the mornings, move back into the river when it is hot, and return to the beach later in the afternoon. Groups comprising an adult male, several females and subadults have been observed to bask together. Adult males dominate groups and tolerate immature males. Large groups of young, subadult and adult gharials form in December and January to bask. Adult males and females associate by mid February. The gharial shares riverine habitat with the mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris) in parts of its range. They use the same nesting grounds, but differ in the selection of basking sites. The gharial basks close to water on shallow, sandy beaches and lays eggs only in sandy soil near water. The mugger crocodile also basks on sandy beaches, but unlike the gharial climbs steep embankments and rocks, and moves farther away from beaches for both basking and nest building. It also preys on fish, but has a broader prey base than the gharial including snakes, turtles, birds, mammals and dead animals. Feeding ecology The gharial is well adapted to hunting fish underwater because of its sharp interlocking teeth and long narrow snout, which meets little resistance in the water. It does not chew its prey, but swallows it whole. Juvenile gharials were observed to jerk their heads back to manoeuvre fish into their gullets, sliding them in head first. Young gharials feed on insects, tadpoles, small fish and frogs. Adults also feed on small crustaceans. Remains of Indian softshell turtle (Nilssonia gangetica) were also found in gharial stomachs. Gharials tear apart large fish and pick up and swallow stones as gastroliths, probably to aid digestion or regulate buoyancy. Some gharial stomachs also contained jewellery. Stones weighing about were found in a gharial's stomach that was shot in the Sharda River in 1910. Reproduction Females mature at a body length of around . Captive females breed at a body length of . Male gharials mature at 15‚Äì18 years of age, when they reach a body length of around and once the ghara is developed. The ghara is apparently used to indicate sexual maturity, as a sound resonator when bubbling underwater or for other sexual behaviours. Courting and mating starts by mid-February at the end of the cold season. In the dry season, reproductive females observed in the Chambal River routinely move and join female breeding groups to dig nests together. They select sites in riverside sand or silt banks located between away from the water and above a water level of . These nests are deep with a diameter of about . Between end of March and early April, they lay 20‚Äì95 eggs. A record clutch with 97 eggs was found in Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary. The eggs are the largest of all crocodilians and weigh an average of . Each egg is long and wide. After 71 to 93 days of incubation, young gharials hatch in July just before the onset of the monsoon. Their sex is most likely determined by temperature, like in most reptiles. Females dig up the hatchlings in response to hatching chirps, but do not assist them to reach the water. They stay at nesting sites until monsoon floods arrive and return after monsoon. Captive male gharials observed in the 1980s did not participate in guarding nests. A captive male gharial was observed to show an interest in hatchlings and was allowed by the female to carry hatchlings on his back. In the Chambal River, females were observed to stay close to nest sites and guard young gharials until the shoreline was flooded. VHF radio tracking of a junior male gharial revealed that he was the dominant male guarding nests at a communal nesting site for two years. Development Young gharial in the breeding center at Kukrail Reserve Forest Hatchlings range from in body length with a weight of . In two years, they grow to a length of and of in three years. Gharials hatched and raised in Nepal's Gharial Conservation and Breeding Center measured and weighed at the age of 45 months in April 2013. They consumed up to of fish per individual and month. By the age of 75 months, they had gained in weight and grown reaching body lengths of . Young gharials in their first year of age hide and forage in shallow water preferably in sites that are surrounded by debris of fallen trees. A study along a stretch of the Chambal River revealed that juvenile gharials up to a body length of prefer basking sites where the mid river water is deep. As their body size increases, they move to sites with deeper water. Subadult and adult gharials above a body length of prefer sites where the water is deeper than . Young gharials move forward by pushing the diagonally opposite legs synchronously. At a young age, they can also gallop but do so only in emergency situations. When they reach a length of about and a weight of about at the age of 8‚Äì9 months, they change to an adult pattern of locomotion of pushing forward with hind and front legs simultaneously. Adults do not have the ability to walk on land in the semi-upright stance as other crocodilians. When basking on the beach, they often turn round so as to face the water. Threats The gharial population is estimated to have declined from 5,000‚Äì10,000 individuals in 1946 to fewer than 250 individuals in 2006, a decline of 96‚Äì98% within three generations. Gharials were killed by fishermen, hunted for skins, trophies and indigenous medicine, and their eggs collected for consumption. Today, the remaining individuals form several fragmented subpopulations. Hunting is no longer considered a significant threat. However, the wild population declined from an estimated 436 adult gharials in 1997 to fewer than 250 mature individuals in 2006. One reason for this decline is the increased use of gill nets for fishing in gharial habitat. The other major reason is the loss of riverine habitat as dams, barrages, irrigation canals and artificial embankments were built; siltation and sand-mining changed river courses; and land near rivers is used for agriculture and grazing by livestock. Water pumps used for pumping water out of the Chambal River have proven to negatively impact the gharial population. When 111 dead gharials were found in the Chambal River between December 2007 and March 2008, it was initially suspected that they had died either because of toxicants or the illegal use of fish nets, in which they became entrapped in and subsequently drowned. Later post mortem pathological testing of tissue samples revealed high levels of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, which, together with stomach ulcers and protozoan parasites reported in most necropsies, were thought to have caused their deaths. Conservation The gharial is listed on CITES Appendix I. In India, it is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. In Nepal, it is fully protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973.  Reintroduction programmes  Gharials in the Gharial Conservation and Breeding Center at Chitwan National Park Since the late 1970s, the gharial conservation approach was focused on reintroduction. Rivers in protected areas in India and Nepal used to be restocked with captive bred juvenile gharials. Gharial eggs were incubated, hatched and juvenile gharials raised for two to three years and released when about one metre in length. In 1975, the Indian Crocodile Conservation Project was set up under the auspices of the Government of India, initially in Odisha's Satkosia Gorge Sanctuary. It was implemented with financial aid of the United Nations Development Fund and the Food and Agriculture Organization. The country's first gharial breeding center was built in Nandankanan Zoological Park. A male gharial was flown in from Frankfurt Zoological Garden to become one of the founding animals of the breeding program. In subsequent years, several protected areas were established. In 1976, two breeding centres were established in Uttar Pradesh, one in Kukrail Reserve Forest and one in Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, with facilities to hatch and raise up to 800 gharials each year for release in rivers. Between 1975 and 1982, sixteen crocodile rehabilitation centers and five crocodile sanctuaries were established in the country. Gharial eggs were initially purchased from Nepal. In 1991, the Ministry of Environment and Forests withdrew funds for the captive-breeding and egg-collection programs, arguing that the project had served its purpose. In 1997‚Äì1998, over 1,200 gharials and over 75 nests were located in the National Chambal Sanctuary, but no surveys were carried out between 1999 and 2003. Gharial eggs collected from wild and captive-breeding nests amounted to 12,000 until 2004. Eggs were incubated, and hatchlings were reared to a length of about one meter or more. More than 5,000 gharials were released into Indian rivers between the early 1980s and 2006. Despite the release of 142 gharials between 1982 and 2007 into the Ken River, only one adult female gharial was observed in the river in spring 2013, indicating that most of the released gharials had not reproduced. In Nepal, wild eggs collected along rivers have been incubated in the Gharial Conservation and Breeding Center in Chitwan National Park since 1978. The first batch of 50 gharials was released in spring 1981 into the Narayani River. In subsequent years, gharials were also released into five other rivers in the country. In 2016, this center was overcrowded with more than 600 gharials aged between 5 and 12 years, and many were too old to be released. Between 1981 and 2018, a total of 1,365 gharials were released in the Rapti‚ÄìNarayani river system. Reintroducing gharials helped to maintain this population, but the survival rate of released gharials was rather low. Of 36 marked gharials released in the spring seasons of 2002 and 2003 into the Rapti‚ÄìNarayani rivers, only 14 were found alive in spring 2004. This reintroduction programme has been criticised in 2017 as not being comprehensive and coordinated, as often too old and unsexed gharials were released at disturbed localities during unfavourable cold months and without assessing the efficiency of these releases. It has been suggested to instead leave wild nests in place, increase protection of nesting and basking sites and monitor the movement of gharials. Releasing captive-reared gharials did not contribute significantly to re- establishing viable populations. Monitoring of released gharials revealed that the reintroduction programmes did not address multiple factors affecting their survival. These factors include disturbances from diversions of river courses, sand mining, cultivation of riversides, fishing by local people and mortality related to fishing methods like the use of gill nets and dynamite. In 2017, members of the Crocodile Specialist Group therefore recommended to foster engagement of local communities in gharial conservation programs. In captivity Gharial in a Florida zoo As of 1999, gharials were also kept in the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, Mysore Zoo, Jaipur Zoo and Kukrail Gharial Rehabilitation Centre in India. In Europe, gharials are kept in Prague Zoo and Protivin Crocodile Zoo in the Czech Republic, and in the German Berlin Zoo. The European studbook of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria is kept in Prague Zoo since 2017. La Ferme aux Crocodiles in France received six juveniles in 2000 from the Gharial Breeding Centre in Nepal. In the United States, gharials are kept in Busch Gardens Tampa, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Fort Worth Zoo, Honolulu Zoo, San Diego Zoo, National Zoological Park, San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium and St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park. Bronx Zoo and Los Angeles Zoo received gharials in 2017. In culture A miniature illustration of the Baburnama showing a gharial, ca. 1598, National Museum, New Delhi The earliest known depictions of the gharial date to the Indus Valley Civilisation. Seals and tablets show gharials with fish in their mouths and surrounded by fish. A tablet shows a deity flanked by a gharial and a fish. These pieces are about 4,000 years old and were found at Mohenjo-daro and Amri, Sindh. A gharial is depicted on one of the rock carvings on a pillar of the Sanchi Stupa, which dates to the 3rd century BC. In Hindu mythology, the gharial is the vehicle of the river deity Ga·πÖgƒÅ and of the wind deity Varuna. In the 16th-century book Baburnama, Zahir-ud-din Muhammad Babur accounted of a gharial sighting in the Ghaghara River between Ghazipur and Benares in 1526. In 1915, a British officer observed the traditional method of Kehal fishermen hunting gharials along the Indus. They staked nets about below the waterline close by a sandbank and waited hidden for gharials to come out of the river for basking. After some time, they left their hiding places, prompting the gharials to dart off to the river and get entangled in the nets. Local people in Nepal attributed various mystical powers to the ghara of male gharials and killed them to collect their snouts. Tharu people believed that the ghara would repel insects and pests when burnt in a field, and that gharial eggs would be an effective cough medicine and aphrodisiac. Jewellery found in gharial stomachs may have been the reason for the belief of local people that they would eat humans. Local names for the gharial include 'Lamthore gohi' and 'Chimpta gohi' in Nepali, whereby gohi means crocodile; 'Gharial' in Hindi; 'Nakar' and 'Bahsoolia nakar' in Bihari; 'Mecho kumhir' in Bengali, with 'mecho' being derived from 'mƒÅch' meaning fish; 'Thantia kumhira' in Odia, with 'thantia' being derived from the Sanskrit word 'tu·πá·∏ça' meaning beak, snout, elephant's trunk; the male is called 'Ghadiala' and the female 'Thantiana' in Odia.

She is the founder of the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, ordinarily referred to as Tzu Chi, a Buddhist humanitarian organization based in Taiwan. In the West, she is sometimes referred to as the \\"Mother Theresa of Asia\\". Cheng Yen was born in Taiwan during the Japanese occupation. She developed an interest in Buddhism as a young adult, ordaining as a Buddhist nun in 1963 under the well known proponent of Humanistic Buddhism, master Yin Shun. After an encounter with a poor woman who had a miscarriage, and a conversation with Roman Catholic nuns who talked about the various charity work of the Catholic Church, Cheng Yen founded the Tzu Chi Foundation in 1966 as a Buddhist humanitarian organization. The organization began as a group of thirty housewives who saved money for needy families. Tzu Chi gradually grew in popularity and expanded its services over time to include medical, environmental, and disaster relief work, eventually becoming one of the largest humanitarian organizations in the world, and the largest Buddhist organization in Taiwan. Cheng Yen is considered to be one of the most influential figures in the development of modern Taiwanese Buddhism. In Taiwan, she is popularly referred to as one of the \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, along with her contemporaries Sheng-yen of Dharma Drum Mountain, Hsing Yun of Fo Guang Shan and Wei Chueh of Chung Tai Shan. Early life Cheng Yen was born \\"Chin-Yun Wong\\" () in 1937 in Kiyomizu Town, Taik≈ç District, Taich≈´ Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan (modern- day Qingshui, Taichung City, Taiwan). Unlike most of the other prominent Taiwanese Buddhist leaders, Cheng Yen was born in Taiwan rather than mainland China. Her uncle was childless, so she was given to be raised by her aunt and uncle. Cheng-Yen grew up during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan during World War II, where she witnessed the devastating effects of war and experienced the bombings in Taiwan. These experiences were credited as contributing to what she regarded as the truth behind the concept of impermanence. In 1945, when she was eight years old, she looked after her sick brother in a hospital for eight months, and so learned more closely about people's pain and helplessness. At the age of 23, her father died suddenly from brain blood vessel disorder that brought about hemorrhaging and stroke. It was in searching for a burial place for him that Cheng Yen first came into close contact with the Buddhist Dharma, associated doctrines, and Buddhist scriptures (sutras). After her father's death, Cheng Yen took over managing her father's theaters and became financially responsible for her family. Bhik·π£u·πáƒ´ Ordination Upon deciding to become a nun, Cheng Yen ran away to a temple in 1960, fearing that if she were to ask leave in advance, she might not be permitted to go. After her first attempt at running away, her mother found her three days later and brought her back home. She ran away from home a second time in 1961. She left to travel through eastern Taiwan with a friendly nun by the name of Xi≈´d√†o (‰øÆÈÅìÊ≥ïÂ∏´). Cheng Yen followed a nontraditional route to becoming a nun, traveling for two years with Xi≈´d√†o. Cheng Yen even shaved her own head before she had been officially ordained a nun. After traveling for two years, Cheng Yen decided that she needed to become an ordained nun in order to continue her lifestyle. She went to the to register for ordination, but was turned down because she did not have a master. Typically, to become a nun in Taiwan, one must be the disciple of a master for two years before ordination. Cheng Yen encountered Yin Shun, whom she asked to be her mentor. He accepted her request, an hour before the registration closed. In February 1963, she became the disciple of her mentor, Yin Shun, who gave her the dharma name of Cheng Yen and the courtesy name of Hu√¨zhƒÅng (ÊÖßÁíã). Yin Shun also gave her the expectation of \\"doing all for the Buddhist religion and for all beings\\", which is written with six characters in Chinese. These six characters became the highest ideals for Cheng Yen in belief, teaching, and practice. In May 1963, shortly after receiving her ordination as a nun, she went to Pu Ming Temple (ÊôÆÊòéÂØ∫) in Hualien County to continue her spiritual formation. As a part of that formation, she recited the Lotus Sutra, which she revered, every day and transcribed every month. It was during her six months there that she vowed to commit herself to the Lotus Sutra and the \\"Path of the Bodhisattvas.\\" Tzu Chi=Lotus Sutra Jing Si Abode where Cheng Yen gives spiritual lessons to disciples Cheng Yen was heavily influenced by the Lotus Sutra, which she called the culmination of the Buddha's teachings. Cheng Yen's initial exposure to the Lotus Sutra happened when she left her family in Fengyuan, Taichung County, and stayed away from the world by lodging in a small hut in Taitung County, in eastern Taiwan. While in Taitung, she accidentally found a Japanese version of the Lotus Sutra, and was pleased with what the book said. Later, she had a friend bring back a Japanese copy of the Lotus Sutra (Myoho Renge Kyo) from Japan, and was inspired by the Mury≈çgi Ky≈ç, or what is better known as the Innumerable Meanings Sutra, which is traditionally regarded as the prologue to the Lotus Sutra. The Innumerable Meanings Sutra addresses human problems, weather behavior, and psychiatric, psychological, and spiritual issues. Miscarriage of Taiwanese Aborigine There were two watershed events that occurred in 1966 that are credited with having inspired Cheng Yen to found Tzu Chi. The first event occurred while Cheng Yen was visiting a hospital in Fenglin. After seeing blood on the hospital floor, she learned that a Taiwanese aborigine woman had a miscarriage. They were forced to carry the pregnant woman back up the mountain after they could not afford the 8000 New Taiwan dollar deposit. The aborigine woman later died. This story actually became source of a legal case in the early 2000s. While Cheng Yen never mentioned the name of the doctor when telling the story, one of her followers did, resulting in a defamation suit against Cheng Yen by the doctor's family. Encounter with Roman Catholic Nuns The second event was a now-famous discussion Cheng Yen had with three Roman Catholic nuns at Pu Ming temple in 1966. While the nuns admitted the profundity of Buddhist teachings, they noted that the Catholic Church had helped people around the world by building schools and hospitals and inquired, \\"But what has Buddhism done for society?\\". The discussion is credited with having made Cheng Yen realize that Buddhism had to do more than simply encourage the private cultivation of people's souls. Founding the Tzu Chi Foundation  Main hall at Tzu Chi Foundation Influenced by the Lotus Sutra, and the encounters with the Taiwanese aborigine woman and the Roman Catholic nuns, Cheng Yen established the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation on 14 May 1966 in an endeavor to help the poor of east Taiwan. The organization started when Cheng Yen encouraged her followers, consisting of thirty housewives, to save fifty cents (US$0.02) from their grocery money every day and store them in bamboo savings banks to help needy families. When posed with the question, \\"Why can't we give once a week?\\" Cheng Yen replied, \\"Because giving is a practice and we need to give every day. If we have a yearning or a positive desire in us, we must nourish it and bring it to fulfillment. Just as Buddha was guided by a noble desire to help others, we too can listen to those who are sad or help those who are in pain.\\" In the first year, fifteen families were provided with aid by the initial thirty followers. Tzu Chi expanded its work from helping needy families to medical aid in 1970. In 1986 Tzu Chi established its first Hospital in Hualien. Tzu Chi has since built hospitals in Yuli, Hualien County; Dalin, Jiayi County; Guanshan, Taitung County; and Xindian, New Taipei City. Tzu Chi experienced modest growth in the first two decades of its establishment, it grew to 293 members in 1968 and by 1986 had just 8,000 members. However, with the surge in popularity of Humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan in the late 1980s and 1990s, Tzu Chi enjoyed a rapid expansion in membership alongside several other major Taiwanese Buddhist organizations. From 1987 to 1991 Tzu Chi membership doubled in size each year, by 1994 it boasted a membership of 4 million members. Interior of main hall of Tzu Chi Foundation Tzu Chi is most well known for its work in disaster relief, Cheng Yen's philosophy includes the notion that not only are those receiving assistance benefiting materially by receiving the aid, but those delivering the aid are also spiritually rewarded when they see the gratitude in the eyes and smiles of the recipients. Tzu Chi's first major disaster relief effort was in 1991, when it undertook relief operations after severe floods hit central and eastern China. One of the most iconic attributes of Tzu Chi disaster relief efforts is that volunteers not only provide short term aid but also partake in long term projects to rebuild the communities affected. Tzu Chi often builds new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster. As of 2015, Tzu Chi has provided disaster relief aid to over 85 countries worldwide. A significant fraction of funds raised by Tzu Chi revolves around environmentally friendly goals such as the encouragement of recycling and using reusable items to reduce waste. As of 2014, the foundation operates over 5,600 recycling stations. Tzu Chi has grown to become a significant actor in civil society, Tzu Chi is not only the largest Buddhist organization in Taiwan, but also Taiwan's largest owner of private land. As of 2013, the organization was estimated to have approximately 10 million members worldwide, and chapters in 47 countries. Da Ai Television In January 1998, Cheng Yen launched Da Ai (literally \\"Great Love\\") Satellite Television (ÊÖàÊøüÂ§ßÊÑõÈõªË¶ñÂè∞; C√≠ j√¨ D√† √Äi Di√†n Sh√¨ T√°i) a 24-hours in daily of satellite television station. Da Ai is commercial free and operates twenty-four hours a day. It is funded by donations as well as partially by Tzu Chi's recycling programs. Da Ai features non-political news, lectures from Cheng Yen and serial programs focused on the virtues, often profiling people who made major changes in their life for the better. Daily schedule Cheng Yen makes a broadcast every morning in an address known as \\"Wisdom at Dawn\\" and makes another address in the evening. She wakes up around 3:45 am to start her activities, such as receiving visitors, and overseeing Tzu Chi's projects throughout Taiwan. She often makes monthly trips around the country to check in on Tzu Chi's projects and activities.

It was released on their 1966 album Revolver, apart from in the United States and Canada, where it instead appeared on Yesterday and Today. The song was written mainly by John Lennon and credited to Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney. The recording features an extended dual-guitar melody, played by George Harrison and Paul McCartney, which anticipated the harmonised guitar arrangements commonly used by Southern rock, hard rock and heavy metal bands. Lennon was later dismissive of \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", referring to it as \\"another of my throwaways ... fancy paper around an empty box\\". The song's working title was \\"You Don't Get Me\\". Its oblique lyrics, and Lennon's failure to reveal their meaning, have encouraged several interpretations. One popular theory is that Lennon was addressing Frank Sinatra in response to a hagiographic article on the singer in Esquire magazine; another contends that the song was directed at Mick Jagger with reference to Marianne Faithfull. The Beatles first recorded the track in the style of the Byrds. This discarded version was released on the 1996 outtakes compilation Anthology 2 and includes the sound of Lennon and McCartney laughing their way through a vocal overdub and unable to sing. Background and inspiration Aside from dismissing it as a substandard work, John Lennon never discussed \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\". His first wife Cynthia recalled that the song was inspired by her presenting Lennon with a clockwork bird inside a gilded cage, wrapped in gift paper, apart from the wind-up mechanism. She wound up the bird as she handed the present to Lennon so that it sang, leaving him with \\"an expression of sheer disbelief on his face\\" as he removed the wrapping paper. According to author Kenneth Womack, Lennon viewed the caged imitation bird as a metaphor for his marriage and a reflection of Cynthia's inability to understand him. The song's working title was \\"You Don't Get Me\\". One of the most popular interpretations of Lennon's lyrics is as a riposte to Frank Sinatra (pictured performing in a 1966 TV special with his daughter Nancy). The lack of an explanation from Lennon himself has led others to speculate on its meaning; music journalist Robert Fontenot states that the lyrics are among \\"the most speculated-upon of any Beatles track\\". In his 2007 book Can't Buy Me Love, Jonathan Gould says that Lennon wrote \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" about Frank Sinatra after reading a hagiographic article on the singer in Esquire magazine. Written by Gay Talese, the article detailed Sinatra's wealth and power, describing him as \\"the fully emancipated male ... the man who can have anything he wants\\", and repeatedly mentioned his use of the word \\"bird\\" to mean a penis. Talese quoted a press release for Sinatra's upcoming TV special, which stated it was a show for those who were \\"tired of kid singers wearing mops of hair thick enough to hide a crate of melons\\", and he said Sinatra aimed to \\"communicate his talent to some rock-and-rollers ‚Äì in a sense, he was battling The Beatles\\". Gould adds that while Lennon would have been amused to read about Sinatra having an assistant dedicated to maintaining his 60 \\"remarkably convincing\\" hairpieces, Lennon was piqued at the recognition afforded Sinatra, at the Beatles' expense, in the recent 1966 Grammy Awards. Singer Marianne Faithfull said the song was addressed to Mick Jagger and written about her, since she was Jagger's girlfriend (or \\"bird\\" in English slang) at the time. This interpretation was proposed by journalist Richard Simpson, and others have cited it as an example of the perceived rivalry between the Beatles and Jagger's band, the Rolling Stones. According to Beatles biographer Steve Turner, Faithfull's interpretation is incorrect, since she was not in a relationship with Jagger until later in 1966. Some writers have speculated that Lennon's lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney. According to Rolling Stone, and supported by Womack, the line \\"You say you've seen seven wonders\\" could be a reference to a comment McCartney made in 1964 when the Beatles were smoking cannabis with Bob Dylan in New York. Under the effects of the drug, McCartney declared that he knew the answer to the questions of existence and told Beatles roadie Mal Evans to write down any statements he made on the subject. McCartney was later dismayed to discover that, rather than the ingenious declarations he recalled, his realisations amounted to the phrase \\"There are seven levels.\\" Photographer Robert Whitaker based his photo \\"Birdcage\\" on the song's lyrics. The photo shows George Harrison's head and shoulders inside a birdcage with the cage door open. The cage was among the props assembled by Whitaker for the 25 March 1966 shoot that produced another photo ‚Äì featuring the Beatles in butchers' coats and covered in dismembered dolls and raw meat ‚Äì that was selected for the cover of the US LP Yesterday and Today. Arrangement and recording \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" contains an extended harmony-lead guitar melody, played by Harrison and McCartney. The latter recalled that he and Harrison wrote the part during the recording sessions. McCartney also stated that he helped on the lyrics and attributed the song \\"80‚Äì20\\" to Lennon. The Beatles first recorded the song on 20 April 1966 at EMI Studios (subsequently Abbey Road Studios) in London. The arrangement was markedly similar to the Byrds' sound; it featured lush vocal harmonies and jangle-style guitars, with Harrison playing his Rickenbacker 360/12 electric guitar. While carrying out vocal overdubs on the track, Lennon and McCartney were overcome by hysterical laughter and unable to sing their parts. Later released on the 1996 Anthology 2 outtakes compilation album, the performance includes the pair giggling, uttering spoken asides, and whistling along with the melody. In his liner notes for the album, Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn comments that the tapes do not indicate the source of the laughter. The group re-recorded the song on 26 April. Whereas the first version was in the key of D major, the remake was played in E major, with the guitarists applying capos to allow for the two-semitone adjustment. Rodriguez and music critic Richie Unterberger speculate that the remake was motivated by the Beatles' realisation that the 20 April recording was overly derivative of the Byrds, and that this aspect had possibly come about through a pun on the word \\"bird\\". The session began with Lennon's tongue-in-cheek introduction, \\"Okay, boys ‚Äì quite brisk, moderato, foxtrot\\", and the group performing a rhythm track that Lewisohn terms \\"very heavy\\", before the mood was lightened in subsequent takes. The twin lead-guitar approach replaced the Rickenbacker jangle from the first version, and the vocal arrangement was pared down to feature mainly Lennon. Harrison and McCartney used their Epiphone Casinos for the lead-guitar lines. In the description of Charles Shaar Murray, the completed track is nevertheless one of the guitar-based songs on Revolver that \\"glisten\\" with \\"cascades of jangle\\", as the Beatles responded to \\"what The Byrds had done with the Fabs' own proto-folk-rock sound on A Hard Day's Night\\". The band used take 10 as their basic track, before overdubs. The latter included McCartney's bass guitar and Ringo Starr adding cymbal and extra hi-hat to augment his drum part. Since the group liked the stuttering bass notes that McCartney had played at the end of take 6, the latter portion was spliced onto the master to close the recording. Release \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" was one of the three songs intended for Revolver that the Beatles reluctantly gave to Capitol Records for inclusion on the North American LP Yesterday and Today. The song was mixed for that purpose on 14 May. It was sequenced as the opening track on side two of the LP, which was released on 20 June in the United States after Capitol had been pressured into withdrawing Whitaker's \\"butcher sleeve\\" cover. The song was remixed on 6 June, towards the end of the Revolver sessions. \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" was sequenced as the second track on side two of the album and issued in the United Kingdom on 5 August. Its omission from the eleven-song US Revolver ensured that Lennon was under-represented on the LP. Since the three new songs on Yesterday and Today were all his, Capitol's version of Revolver included just two songs for which he was the principal writer. The Beatles did not perform any of the songs from Revolver during their August 1966 US tour. While acknowledging that several of the tracks would have been impossible to reproduce in concert, Unterberger says that guitar-based songs such as \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" would have been easy to arrange for live performance. He views its omission as indicative of the band's mindset that touring had become a futile exercise, but rues that they did not seek to regain enthusiasm by playing recent material that would have suited their stage act. Recalling the album's release in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner commented that whereas the group's more traditional fans warmed to McCartney's new songs, \\"Lennon's numbers were a different kettle of fish entirely\\" due to their oblique lyrics. While he also viewed the music of \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" as a natural choice for live performance, relative to the more complex recordings on Revolver, he added: > But what was/is one to make of lines like \\"You say you've seen seven wonders > / And your bird is green / But you don't see me ...?\\" Perhaps John was still > under the influence of Bob Dylan, who at the time seemed to take pleasure in > confounding dissectors of his \\"message\\" with cryptic lyrics that made no > sense at all. Reception In 2006, Mojo placed \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" at number 41 on its list of \\"The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs\\". In his commentary on the track, English academic Toby Litt admired its Indian drone quality and the raga influence in the guitar melody. He said that the riff was perhaps \\"the most baroque that pop music ever came up with\\", adding: \\"Slow it down and it could be a Bach chorale.\\" The following year, Q magazine ranked the song at number 6 on its list \\"The 20 Greatest Guitar Tracks\\". In October 2008, Guitar World magazine ranked Harrison's playing on the song at number 69 on its list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\\". In his 50th anniversary review for Revolver, Steve Marinucci of Billboard described \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" as \\"an incredibly ambitious song, highlighted by a superb guitar solo by George Harrison\\". Thomas Ward of AllMusic describes the song as one of the finest on Revolver. He writes that although Lennon was indifferent to the song and the lyric is \\"probably nonsense\\", it's \\"wildly entertaining\\" and complements the vocal performances. Ward further praises Harrison's guitar playing, the \\"lovely\\" melody and the \\"unorthodox, yet ingenious bridge\\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone writes that despite Lennon's dislike of it, \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" is \\"one of his best songs ever\\", describing it as \\"scathing ... yet also empathetic and friendly\\". Legacy \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" was used as the theme song for the Beatles' cartoon series during its third season. It was one of the 45 playable tracks included in the 2009 release of the music video game The Beatles: Rock Band. In addition to the song's lyric being among the most widely and diversely interpreted in the Beatles' discography, the Anthology 2 recording is one of the band's most celebrated outtakes. The use of dual, harmonised lead guitar parts on the track was still in its infancy in 1966. The editors of Guitar World comment that this type of pop-rock arrangement would later be popularised by Southern rock bands such as the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd, as well as hard rock and metal acts such as Thin Lizzy, Boston and Iron Maiden. American guitarist Joe Walsh sought to master the solo on \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", believing that Harrison had played it in a single take. Walsh, who married the sister of Starr's second wife, Barbara Bach, said he only discovered that it consisted of two parts when discussing with Starr how he had spent years labouring over the solo. Walsh concluded, \\"I think I‚Äôm the only guy who can play it ‚Äì including George.\\" \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" was included on the Beatles' 2012 iTunes compilation Tomorrow Never Knows, which the band's website described as a collection of \\"the Beatles' most influential rock songs\\". In his commentary for Mojo, Litt identified the track as \\"the birth of all powerpop, from Big Star through Cheap Trick to Fountains of Wayne\\" and the inspiration for other artists that \\"use jangle to attack\\". Steve Turner credits Revolver with \\"open[ing] the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)\\" and says that the primitive means by which it was recorded (on four-track equipment) inspired the work that artists such as Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes and the Electric Light Orchestra were able to achieve with advances in studio technology. In 2002, Genesis drummer and vocalist Phil Collins said it was his favourite Beatles album and highlighted \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" as \\"one of the best songs ever written, and it's only a minute and a half long\\". Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain contributed a recording of the song to Revolver Reloaded, a CD that accompanied Mojos July 2006 issue celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Beatles' album. The magazine's editors commented that Reid's version suggests that Phil Spector would have been an ideal choice to produce \\"arguably the finest UK band of the '80s\\". Among the other artists who have covered \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" are the Flamin' Groovies, the Charles River Valley Boys, Spanky and Our Gang, the Jam, Guadalcanal Diary, Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs, Les Fradkin, R. Stevie Moore and I Fight Dragons.

Since 1998, he has released 8 full-length studio albums, The End Is Not the End (2016) being his most recent.  Education  Mallman graduated from Waukesha South High School in 1991. He studied jazz piano at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music then moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1991. In 1995, at age 21, Mallman earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Minneapolis College of Art and Design, where he studied painting and performance art.  Musical career  Mark Mallman has earned a reputation as one of the Twin Cities' must-see live acts, complete with his own star on the wall outside First Avenue. He started his career in the late 1990s with the short-lived band, the Odd, a surprisingly popular postmodern joke on 1970s rock histrionics. Days after they topped the City Pages \\"Best new Band\\" poll, they broke up, but reunited to record and release one album, Oh My G*d ‚Äì It's the Odd in 1998, which was co-written and co-produced by Mallman. His solo debut came in 1998 with the release of The Tourist. In 2000, Mallman issued his sophomore effort, How I Lost My Life and Lived to Tell about It, which featured guest spots by Kat Bjelland of Babes in Toyland and Mallman's schoolmate, Davey von Bohlen of The Promise Ring. The Red Bedroom, his third album, was issued in Spring 2002. It was produced by Radiohead producer Paul Q. Kolderie. The Who's Gonna Save You Now? EP and the live effort Live from First Avenue, Minneapolis were released in 2003. Mr. Serious, Mallman's first self-produced album, followed in 2004. It marked his first album for Badman Recording Company. His energetic performance style, combining the attitudes of punk rockers like Johnny Rotten and Darby Crash over the 70s disco-glam of Elton John, began to gain attention throughout the United States around the time of this record. While he tirelessly performed 150 shows per year, Mallman released Between the Devil and Middle C in 2006, and Invincible Criminal in 2009. Invincible Criminal featured a duet with Craig Finn of The Hold Steady, and violins by Shannon Frid of Cloud Cult. After an extensive amount of touring the United States, he spent the first half of 2012 in Los Angeles writing and recording Double Silhouette, which was released later that year. On March 25, 2016, Mallman released \\"The End is Not The End.\\" David Bowie's Scary Monsters and Super Creeps helped inspire the direction Mallman took with each of the album's twelve tracks. The theme of life after death and constant rebirth on earth is affirmed throughout the entirety of the album. Mallman created the album after his mother died and he was dealing with depression and anxiety attacks. He says it's \\"a deliberate meditation on overcoming the roots of despair.\\"  Marathon song cycles  The Cave at Carleton College in 2004. In 1999 Mallman performed a 26-hour long song titled \\"Marathon 1\\". Later, in 2004, Mallman's \\"Marathon Two\\" session took place back at the Turf Club in St. Paul, Minnesota. Seventy-five musicians took turns backing Mallman as he performed one song for over two consecutive days, only breaking to go to the bathroom. On October 10, 2010, he completed \\"Marathon 3\\", a 78-hour long song complete with 576 pages of lyrics. During the performance, he injured his left foot. He finished at 10pm on Sunday night by biting into a bouquet of flowers and spitting them over the crowd. Mayor Chris Coleman declared October 7‚Äì10, 2010 \\"Mark Mallman Days\\" in St. Paul, Minnesota in honor of his creative achievement. The mayor's proclamation included the statement \\"Whereas Mark Mallman is totally AWESOME.\\" From September 15 to Sept 22, 2012 he endured \\"Marathon IV: Road Rogue\\", an 8-day, 150-hour plus nonstop performance from New York to Los Angeles in the back of a van. Marathon IV: Road Rogue was the first ever intercontinental mobile musical webcast in the history of the Internet. In addition to the pioneering webcast, Mallman also employed a hacked midi brain controller which enabled him to perform music with his brainwaves while he was sleeping.  Film music  Mallman started working on video game music in 2001. That led to working on trailers, starting with the 2007 remake of the thriller \\"The Hitcher.\\" Mallman was a professional composer of major motion picture trailers, such as Adventureland, 10,000 BC and Haunting of Molly Hartley from 2006 - 2009. He has also composed music for Living Arrangements (2009). In 2012, he composed the score for the Lion's Gate / Machinima webseries Bite Me. He currently operates his own music composition company, Bermuda Music, in Minneapolis.

She was one of the most prolific composers in Britain at the time of her death, having written five symphonies, seven concerti, and numerous chamber and choral works. She founded both the London Repertoire Orchestra and the Chanticleer Orchestra and served as conductor and music director for the City of Birmingham Choir. Later in her life she served as chairwoman of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain.[The Musical Times, Vol. 140, No. 1867 (Summer, 1999), pp. 8-9]  Life and career  Gipps was born in Bexhill-on-Sea, England in 1921 to Bryan and H√©len√® (Johner) Gipps. Her mother was principal of the Bexhill School of Music.\\"'Remarkable' story of Dr Ruth Gipps\\", The Times, 26 May 1967, p 9 Ruth was a child prodigy, winning performance competitions in which she was considerably younger than the rest of the field. After performing her first composition at the age of 8 in one of the numerous music festivals she entered, the work was bought by a publishing house for a guinea and a half. Winning a concerto competition with the Hastings Municipal Orchestra began her performance career in earnest. In 1937 Gipps entered the Royal College of Music, where she studied oboe with L√©on Goossens, piano with Arthur Alexander and composition with Gordon Jacob, and later with Ralph Vaughan Williams. Several of her works were first performed there. Continuing her studies at Durham University led her to meet her future husband, clarinettist Robert Baker. At age 26, for her work, The Cat, she became the youngest British woman to receive a doctorate in music.[Christ, Peter. Little Tunes for the Big Bassoon. Crystal Records Inc. 1997. Compact Disk Folder.] She was an accomplished all-round musician, as a soloist on both oboe and piano as well as a prolific composer. Her repertoire included works such as Arthur Bliss's Piano Concerto and Constant Lambert's The Rio Grande. When she was 33 a shoulder injury ended her performance career, and she decided to focus her energies on conducting and composition. An early success came when Sir Henry Wood conducted her tone poem Knight in Armour at the Last Night of the Proms in 1942. Gipps' music is marked by a skillful use of instrumental colour, and often shows the influence of Vaughan Williams, rejecting the trends in avant- garde modern music such as serialism and twelve-tone music. She considered her orchestral works, her five symphonies in particular, as her greatest works. Two substantial piano concertos were also produced. After the war, Gipps turned her attention to chamber music, and in 1956 she won the Cobbett Prize of the Society of Women Musicians for her Clarinet Sonata, Op. 45. In March 1945, she performed Glazunov's Piano Concerto No. 1 with the City of Birmingham Orchestra as a piano soloist while also, in the same program, performing in her own Symphony No. 1 on cor anglais under the baton of George Weldon.Gunderson, Finn S. Chandos Records Ltd. 2018. Audio Recording Booklet. Her early career was affected strongly by discrimination against women in the male-dominated ranks of music (and particularly composition), by professors and judges as well as the world of music criticism. Because of it she developed a tough personality that many found off-putting, and a fierce determination to prove herself through her work.C. Pluygers: ‚ÄòDiscrimination ‚Ä¶ the Career and Struggle for Recognition of Dr Ruth Gipps‚Äô, Winds (1992), pp. 14‚Äì15 She founded the London Repertoire Orchestra in 1955 as an opportunity for young professional musicians to become exposed to a wide range of music. In 1957 she conducted the Pro Arte Orchestra. She later founded the Chanticleer Orchestra in 1961, a professional ensemble which included a work by a living composer in each of its programs, often a premiere performance. Later she would take faculty posts at Trinity College, London (1959 to 1966), the Royal College of Music (1967 to 1977), and then Kingston Polytechnic at Gypsy Hill. In 1967 she was appointed chairwoman of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain. On her retirement, Gipps returned to Sussex, living at Tickerage Castle near Framfield until her death in 1999, aged 78, after suffering the effects of cancer and a stroke.

Today his name lives on in the name of the Massey Ferguson company.  Early life  Harry Ferguson's birthplace Ferguson was born at Growell, near Dromore, in County Down, Ireland, the son of a farmer. In 1902, Ferguson went to work with his brother, Joe, in his bicycle and car repair business. While working there as a mechanic, he developed an interest in aviation, visiting airshows abroad. In 1904, he began to race motorcycles.  Aviation  A1 road depicting Ferguson's first flight In the 1900s the young Harry Ferguson became fascinated with the newly emerging technology of powered human flight and particularly with the exploits of the Wright brothers, the American aviation pioneers who made the first plane flight in 1903 in North Carolina, USA. The first person to accomplish powered flight in the UK was Alliot Verdon Roe in June 1908, who also flew an aeroplane of his own design, but this had not yet been achieved in Ireland. Ferguson began to develop a keen interest in the mechanics of flying and travelled to several air shows, including exhibitions in 1909 at Blackpool and Rheims where he took notes of the design of early aircraft. Harry convinced his brother that they should attempt to build an aircraft at their Belfast workshop and working from Harry's notes, they worked on the design of a plane, the Ferguson monoplane. After making many changes and improvements, they transported their new aircraft by towing it behind a car through the streets of Belfast up to Hillsborough Park to make their first attempt at flight. They were at first thwarted by propeller trouble but continued to make technical alterations to the plane. After a delay of nearly a week caused by bad weather, the Ferguson monoplane finally took off from Hillsborough on 31 December 1909. Harry Ferguson became the first Irishman to fly and the first Irishman to build and fly his own aeroplane.  Business career  A magazine article showing and describing Ferguson's tractor hitch development status as of 1922. It is a fully mechanical version with a depth wheel (small wheel that sets the plow depth). A Ferguson Tractor After falling out with his brother over the safety and future of aviation Ferguson decided to go it alone, and in 1911 founded a company selling Maxwell, Star and Vauxhall cars and Overtime Tractors. Ferguson saw at first hand the weakness of having tractor and plough as separate articulated units, and in 1917 he devised a plough that could be rigidly attached to a Model T Ford car‚Äîthe Eros, which became a limited success, competing with the Model F Fordson. In 1917 Ferguson met Charles E. Sorensen while Sorensen was in England scouting production sites for the Fordson tractor.. They discussed methods of hitching the implement to the tractor to make them a unit (as opposed to towing the implement like a trailer). In 1920 and 1921 Ferguson demonstrated early versions of his three- point linkage on Fordsons at Cork and at Dearborn. Ferguson and Henry Ford discussed putting the Ferguson system of hitch and implements onto Fordson tractors at the factory, but no deal was struck. At the time the hitch was mechanical. Ferguson and his team of longtime colleagues, including Willie Sands and Archie Greer, soon developed a hydraulic version, which was patented in 1926. After one or two false starts, Ferguson eventually founded the Ferguson-Sherman Inc., with Eber and George Sherman. The new enterprise manufactured the Ferguson plough incorporating the patented \\"Duplex\\" hitch system mainly intended for the Fordson \\"F\\" tractor. Following several more years of development, Ferguson's new hydraulic version of the three-point linkage was first seen on his prototype \\"Ferguson Black\\" or ‚ÄòIrish tractor‚Äô as Harry called it, now in the Science Museum, Kensington, London. A production version of the \\"Black\\" was introduced in May 1936, made at one of the David Brown factories in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, and designated Ferguson Model A tractor. In 1938, Ferguson's interests were merged with those of David Brown junior to create the Ferguson-Brown Company. In October 1938, Ferguson demonstrated his latest tractor to Henry Ford at Dearborn, and they made the famous \\"handshake agreement\\". Ferguson took with him his latest patents covering future improvements to the Ferguson tractor and it is these that led to the Ford-Ferguson 9N introduced to the world on 29 June 1939. The 1938 agreement intended that the Ferguson tractor should also be made in the UK at the Ford Ltd factory at Dagenham, Essex but Ford did not have full control at Dagenham and, while Ford Ltd did import US-made 9N/2Ns, Dagenham did not make any. Henry Ford II, Ford's grandson, ended the handshake deal on 30 June 1947, following unsuccessful negotiations with Ferguson, but continued to produce a tractor, the 8N, incorporating Ferguson's inventions, the patents on almost all of which had not yet expired, and Ferguson was left without a tractor to sell in North America. Ferguson's reaction was a lawsuit demanding compensation for damage to his business and for Ford's illegal use of his designs.\\"Claim Against Ford Company\\", The Times, Thursday, 6 October 1949; p. 2; Issue 51505\\"Tractor Inventor's ¬£90M. Claim. Allegations Against Ford Company\\", The Times, Tuesday, 27 March 1951; p. 3; Issue 51959 The case was settled out of court in April 1952 for just over $9 million.\\"Settlement in Suit Against Ford Company ¬£3M. Award To Fergusons\\", The Times, Thursday, 10 April 1952; p. 6; Issue 52283 The court case cost him about half of that and a great deal of stress and ill health. By 1952, most of the important Ferguson patents had expired, and this allowed Henry Ford II to claim that the case had not restricted Ford's activities too much. It follows that all the world's other tractor manufacturers could also use Ferguson's inventions, which they duly did. A year later Ferguson merged with Massey Harris to become Massey- Harris-Ferguson Co., later Massey Ferguson.  Standard Motor Company  As a consequence of Dagenham's failure to make the tractors, Harry Ferguson made a deal with Sir John Black\\"Standard Motor Company Record Turnover And Profit, Mr. C. J. Band on Expansion Policy\\", The Times, Friday, 21 December 1945; p. 10; Issue 50331 of the Standard Motor Company to refit their armaments factory at Banner Lane, Coventry. Production of the latest Ferguson tractor, the TE20, started in the autumn of 1946, over 20,800 TEs being built by the end of 1947. To fill the gap in Ferguson's sales in the US, thousands of TEs were shipped over from England.  Harry Ferguson Inc  The Ferguson P99 racing car Production of a US version, the TO20, started at a new plant, owned by Harry Ferguson Inc, in October 1948, leaving the UK plant to supply the rest of the world. Ferguson's research division went on to develop various cars and tractors, including the first Formula One four-wheel-drive car (see Ferguson Research Ltd.).  Four wheel drive systems  Ferguson's four wheel drive system, utilising an open centre differential gear, was used in Formula 1 race cars and in the Range Rover and later in constant four-wheel-drive Land Rovers.  Death  Ferguson died at his home at Stow-on-the-Wold in 1960, as the result of a barbiturate overdose; the inquest was unable to conclude whether this had been accidental or not.{{cn  Memorials and recognition  County Down A blue plaque commemorating Ferguson is mounted on the Ulster Bank building in Donegall Square, Belfast, the former site of his showroom. A granite memorial has been erected to Ferguson's pioneering flight on the North Promenade, Newcastle, and a full-scale replica of the Ferguson monoplane and an early Ferguson tractor and plough can be seen at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Cultra. Ferguson was commemorated in 1981 when he appeared on stamps issued by the Irish Post Office in the Republic of Ireland. In Northern Ireland, Danske Bank (formerly Northern Bank) issues its own ¬£20 sterling notes which bear a portrait of Ferguson alongside a Ferguson tractor. In 2008 the Harry Ferguson Memorial gardens were officially opened, opposite the house he lived in, just outside Dromara, Co. Down. A life-size bronze sculpture of Ferguson by John Sherlock was erected in the garden depicting Ferguson leaning on a fence surveying the view. The gardens are open to the public. The University of Ulster opened the Harry Ferguson Engineering Village (18 February 2004) on the Jordanstown campus in recognition of the contribution made by him to engineering and innovation in Ireland.http://www.gerrymckenna.co.uk/gallery/index.php?pageNum=4 The Science Museum in London has on display one of Harry Ferguson's prototype tractors completed in 1935 as part of its history of agriculture exhibition, including information panels outlining his role in revolutionising the use of the farm tractor and its impact on the development of modern agriculture.

He played college football for the University of Michigan and professional football for the Los Angeles Dons, Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1976 and the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1996. Ford was an all-city athlete at his high school in Washington, D.C., and attended Morgan State University after graduating in 1944. After a brief stint in the U.S. Navy the following year, he transferred to Michigan, where he played on the Michigan Wolverines football team as an offensive and defensive end. He played for Michigan from 1945 to 1947 and was a member of the undefeated 1947 team that has been selected as the best team in the history of Michigan football. Ford was passed over in all 32 rounds of the 1948 NFL Draft, but was selected by the Los Angeles Dons of the rival All-America Football Conference (AAFC), where he played for two seasons as an offensive and defensive end. After the AAFC dissolved in 1949, Ford played eight seasons as a defensive end for the Cleveland Browns. During those eight seasons, the Browns advanced to the NFL championship game seven times, won three championships, and allowed the fewest points in the NFL six times. Ford was one of the dominant defensive players of his era, having a rare combination of size and speed that helped him disrupt opposing offenses and force fumbles. He was selected as a first-team All-NFL player five times and played in four Pro Bowls. He was also one of two defensive ends named to the National Football League 1950s All-Decade Team. Ford was traded to the Packers in 1958, but played there just one season before retiring. He worked for the Detroit recreation department from 1963 to 1972. He suffered a heart attack and died in 1972 at age 46. Early years Ford was born in Washington, D.C., in 1926. His father, Leonard G. Ford, Sr., was a Virginia native who was employed as a \\"skilled laborer\\" by the federal government in 1920 and as a printing operator at the Government Printing Office in 1940. His mother, Jeraldine, was also a Virginia native who worked as a social worker in a settlement house in 1940. Ford had an older sister, Anita, and a younger brother, Claude.1930 U.S. Census for Leonard G. Ford and family.

As a teenager, Ford attended Armstrong Technical High School, where he played football, basketball and baseball. As a high school athlete, he aspired to play fullback in football, but he later recalled, \\"I started to grow, and I grew right out of the backfield.\\" He was chosen by local sportswriters as an all-city athlete in all three sports in his senior year, and he served as captain of all three teams for one season each. After he graduated in 1944, Theodore McIntyre, Ford's high school football coach, suggested he attend Morgan State University, a historically black college in Baltimore, Maryland. Ford played for the Morgan State Bears football team for one year under head coach Edward P. Hurt, while also starring as the center on the school's basketball team. The basketball team won its league's championship in 1944. Ford left Morgan State and joined the U.S. Navy in 1945, but stayed in the service only briefly as World War II came to an end.Bloomfield, Gary L. Duty, Honor, Victory: America's Athletes in World War II. Guilford, Conn: Lyons Press, 2003, page 250, University of Michigan Bob Mann of Omega Psi Phi both went on to play in the NFL. After the war, Ford transferred to the University of Michigan to play football in a bigger program than Morgan State's. He wanted to \\"get a shot at playing in the Rose Bowl one day\\", he later said. While attending Michigan, he was a member of Omega Psi Phi, an all-black fraternity whose membership also included Bob Mann, another Michigan end who went on to play in the NFL.1947 Michiganensian, p. 269. 1945 and 1946 seasons In 1945, Ford was Michigan's tallest player at and 190 pounds. Ford played as a backup at the left end for the 1945 Michigan football team that compiled a 7‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record under head coach Fritz Crisler. When Ford caught a pass from Wally Teninga in Michigan's 26-0 victory over Minnesota in early November 1945, The New York Times took note and referred to Ford as \\"a six-foot, five-inch giant.\\" As a junior in 1946, Ford had gained 16 pounds and weighed 206 pounds. That year, Ford and Bob Mann shared the left end position, with Ford starting four games and Mann two. The 1946 Michigan team finished with a 6‚Äì2‚Äì1 record. During the 1946 season, Ford established himself as a tenacious tackler on defense and was also a receiving threat as an end on offense. In the first game of the 1946 season, a 21-0 victory over Indiana, Ford recovered an Indiana fumble and then scored the game's second touchdown on a 17-yard pass from Pete Elliott, \\"leaping high in the air to grab the pigskin with one hand from the two backs guarding him in the end zone.\\" Later in the season, he scored a touchdown against Wisconsin on an end-around, a play Michigan employed frequently with Ford. Ford also developed a reputation for forcing opponent fumbles with his technique of \\"punching at the ball\\". 1947 season By 1947, Ford had grown to 215 pounds, 25 pounds heavier than he had weighed in 1945. Led by All-American halfbacks Bob Chappuis and Bump Elliott, the undefeated 1947 Michigan team has been selected as the best team in the history of Michigan football. Nicknamed the \\"Mad Magicians\\", the Michigan squad finished with a 10‚Äì0 record, capped by a 49‚Äì0 victory in the Rose Bowl over USC on New Year's Day. Ford started only one game in 1947, as Bob Mann was the starting left end in eight of Michigan's 10 games. Even with reduced playing time, Ford caught a 35-yard touchdown pass in the first game of the season and had two receptions for 82 yards in the 55‚Äì0 win over Michigan State. He scored again in a game against Pitt. Ford's defensive performance was credited with shutting down Ohio State in the final game of the 1947 season. After the Wolverines' 21-0 victory over the Buckeyes, The Michigan Daily wrote: Ford speaks to fans in Michigan after victory in 1948 Rose Bowl > For the defense it was big Len Ford, who sparked a forward wall that never > let the Bucks threaten. His end was practically impregnable. He smashed Ohio > interference time and again, he continually harassed Dick Slager and Pandel > Savic, the Ohio passers, and he made life miserable for Pete Perini, > blocking one punt and rushing the Buckeye punter on nearly all of his kicks. Michigan finished first in the AP Poll and won the 1947 college football national championship, sharing the honor with Notre Dame, which had been first in the polls before the Rose Bowl. After the 1947 season, the Associated Press (AP) selected Ford as a third-team All-American end and named teammate Bob Mann as a second-team All-American end. The AP also named Ford a second-team all-Big Nine Conference end. In the summer of 1948, he accepted an invitation to play for the college team in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual matchup between the champion of the professional National Football League (NFL) and a selection of the country's best college players. Professional career=Los Angeles Dons (AAFC) Despite his accomplishments in college, Ford was passed over in all 32 rounds of the 1948 NFL Draft during a time when most professional teams did not employ African- Americans. (The following year, George Taliaferro became the first African- American to be selected in an NFL draft.) He was selected, however, by the Los Angeles Dons of the rival All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in the third round of the 1948 AAFC Draft. He signed with the Dons in April 1948. Playing as a right end opposite Joe Aguirre, Ford had 31 catches for 598 yards and seven touchdowns in 1948. As was the case at Michigan, Ford also worked on defense and was one of the AAFC's most successful pass-rushers. The Dons, meanwhile, finished the regular season with a 7‚Äì7 record, good for third place in the AAFC West. Ford played basketball in the off-season for the New York Renaissance, an all-black professional team in the National Basketball League. He did not play basketball at Michigan, the Big Ten Conference having maintained racial segregation of basketball until 1950. Ford had 36 catches for 577 yards and one touchdown in 1949, while the Dons fell to 4‚Äì8. The AAFC struggled financially during Ford's time with the Dons. Its teams competed with NFL franchises for fans' attention and player talent ‚Äì the Dons shared a city with the NFL's Los Angeles Rams. By late 1949, team owners came to an agreement under which the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts joined the NFL and the rest of the league's teams, including the Dons, folded. Cleveland Browns Ford pictured on a 1955 football card, while with the Browns =1950 season= After the AAFC disbanded, the Browns selected Ford in the second round of the 1950 AAFC dispersal draft, created to reallocate former Dons, Buffalo Bills and Chicago Hornets players. Ford signed with the Browns in July 1950. Cleveland head coach Paul Brown converted Ford into solely a defensive end as two-platoon systems gained popularity after 1950. Ford bulked up to 260 pounds and quickly became a fixture of Cleveland's defense alongside linebacker Bill Willis and defensive back Warren Lahr. He was one of five black players for Cleveland ‚Äì the others were Willis, punter Horace Gillom and fullbacks Emerson Cole and Marion Motley ‚Äì at a time when many other teams had never signed a black player. The Browns, in fact, had roughly a third of the black players in the NFL on their roster. Cleveland sports writer Chuck Heaton later recalled that Ford was \\"a leader, particularly with the black players on the squad.\\" Led by an offense that featured Motley, quarterback Otto Graham and ends Mac Speedie and Dante Lavelli, the 1950 Browns finished the regular season with a 10‚Äì2 record and won the 1950 NFL Championship Game over the Los Angeles Rams. In a mid-October game against the Chicago Cardinals, an elbow by Pat Harder broke Ford's nose, cheekbone, and maxilla (upper jaw), knocked out two teeth, loosened several teeth and chipped another. Ford, who had been fighting with Harder throughout the game, punched him following the play, resulting in a penalty, his ejection from the game and a $50 ($ in dollars) fine. NFL commissioner Bert Bell withdrew the fine when the damage to Ford's face was revealed. Ford's facial injuries were so severe that a plastic surgery was required, \\"virtually rebuilding the big end's face.\\" The Browns' long-time team doctor, Vic Ippolito, described Ford's injuries as \\"a sickening sight.\\" Because of the injury, Ford started only four regular season games in 1950. However, he asked to be reinstated for the 1950 NFL Championship Game. Head coach Paul Brown agreed to allow Ford to suit up after receiving approval from the team doctor and arranging for a special mask to be built to protect Ford from further injury. Ford had been on a liquid diet until late November and dropped from 240 to 215 pound, though he was back up to 223 pounds shortly before the championship game. As the championship game got underway, Ford sat on the bench as the Rams moved the ball 82 yards down the field for a touchdown. Browns head coach Paul Brown knew the defense had to tighten, and he called on Ford to enter the game. The Cleveland Plain Dealer later called this \\"one of Len Ford's great moments.\\" Paul Brown stated that Ford \\"showed me that day he really was a man.\\" Brown later recalled that Ford was the team's \\"only real hope of plugging a hole\\" and recalled one sequence as a defining moment in the game: The Browns' defense held the Rams scoreless in the fourth quarter, and the Browns won the championship game by a 30-28 score in their first season in the league. =1951 season= Ford continued to excel as a pass-rusher in 1951, when the Browns again advanced to the NFL Championship Game but lost to the Rams. He recovered four fumbles during the season and was named a first- team All-Pro by both the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). He was also named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game. Ford's dominating play allowed Brown to assign him to two offensive linemen, giving Cleveland the latitude to put four men on the line and use three linebackers in what is now known as the 4‚Äì3 defense. Cleveland's defensive coach Blanton Collier later recalled the thinking behind moving Ford: \\"We knew we had to get him in closer where his talents as a pass rusher could best be utilized. So we moved both tackles in and dropped the linebackers off the outside. It may have been the beginning of today's 4‚Äì3 defense.\\" Collier also noted that \\"Len was very aggressive and had that touch of meanness in him that you find in most defensive players.\\" =1952 season= The 1952 Browns had eight regular-season wins and won the NFL's East Division, but lost to the Detroit Lions in the 1952 NFL Championship Game. Ford, meanwhile, extended his run of dominance against opposing offenses in an era before the quarterback sack was a recorded statistic. For the second consecutive year, he was named a first-team All-Pro by both the AP and UPI and was selected for the Pro Bowl. =1953 season= The 1953 Browns compiled an 11-1 record and again advanced to the NFL Championship Game, losing to the Detroit Lions. For the third consecutive year, Ford was named a first-team All-Pro by both the AP and UPI and was selected for the Pro Bowl. =1954 season= Willis and Motley retired after the 1953 season, but Ford and Don Colo continued to anchor the defense alongside Lahr in the secondary. The 1954 Browns lost two of their first three games, but finished the season with a 9‚Äì3 record and returned to win the 1954 NFL Championship Game over the Lions. Ford had two interceptions in the Browns' 56‚Äì10 win over the Lions, including one which he returned 45 yards to set a new NFL playoff record. Ford recovered a career-high five fumbles in 1954, and he was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the AP and UPI for the fourth year in a row. He was also selected to play in his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl. =1955 season= The 1955 Browns compiled a 9‚Äì2‚Äì1 record in 1955 and won the 1955 NFL Championship Game against the Los Angeles Rams, helped by a strong defensive effort and six interceptions of quarterback Norm Van Brocklin. Ford was selected as a first- team All-Pro by the UPI, the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) and the New York Daily News. He was named a second-team All-Pro by the AP. =1956 and 1957 seasons= Graham and many of the players that had helped propel the Browns to a series of championship game appearances retired before the 1956 season. The 1956 team finished 5‚Äì7 that year, its first-ever losing record. By 1957, there was speculation that Ford, then age 31, might not make the Browns' roster. Ford arrived at training camp well above his playing weight, and rookie Bob Mischak was given Ford's spot in August. When Mischak withdrew from the team, the spot was awarded to another rookie, Paul Wiggin. Ford worked to shed pounds during training camp and worked to train the young defensive players, including Wiggin and Bill Quinlan. Rookie running back Jim Brown recalled that Ford pulled him aside during the 1957 training camp and gave him advice on dealing with the Browns' head coach Paul Brown. Ford advised the rookie to keep his mouth shut and do as the coach set during practice and waiting until game day: \\"Run it your way in the game and hope it works, and if it does, don't say anything. Just make your yardage and act like it was a mistake.\\" Ford was slowed for several weeks during the 1957 season by a severely bruised shoulder, but the Browns, led by Jim Brown, reached the 1957 NFL Championship Game, losing to the Lions. Cleveland's defense allowed the fewest points in the NFL in six of Ford's eight seasons with the team. Green Bay Packers In May 1958, the Browns traded Ford to the Green Bay Packers in exchange for a draft choice. Green Bay coach Ray McLean said at the time that he acquired Ford for his talent at putting pressure on the quarterback and noted that \\"he's one of the toughest guys in the league to block because of his speed, size and agility.\\" The 1958 Green Bay team won just one game in Ford's lone season there. Ford suffered multiple broken fingers before the last game of the 1958 season, and, because he was unable to play, the Packers refused to pay Ford the final $916.66 due on his contract. In 1961, Ford sued the Packers in Wayne County Circuit Court in Detroit to collect the $916.66 plus $10,000 for alleged damage to his reputation caused by the Packers' releasing him. Career statistics and legacy Ford recovered 20 fumbles in his career, an NFL record at the time he retired as a player. He was successful in part because of his combination of quickness and size. Few players of his era who were as tall and big as he was could move as fast; only Larry Brink of the Rams was close to him in proportions. In 1969, Ford placed second in voting for the greatest defense end in NFL history. He was edged out by Gino Marchetti. He and Marchetti were selected as the defensive ends on the National Football League 1950s All-Decade Team. In 1976, Ford was posthumously inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was selected for induction by the 27-man media board that had responsibility for selections at that time. He was also inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1996. Family and later years In 1951, Ford married Geraldine Bledsoe Ford (1926‚Äì2003), who was a lawyer in the 1950s, and in the mid-1960s became the first African-American woman to serve as a judge in Michigan. They had two daughters, Anita and Deborah, and divorced in 1959. While playing in the NFL, Ford worked during the off-season in a Detroit real estate office. He developed a reputation for being \\"cagey with the dollar\\" and told Jet magazine in 1955: \\"In what other sport can a boy just graduated from college make $5,000 in his first six months, then have a half-year left to make more money?\\" After retiring from football, Ford attended the Detroit College of Law for a year-and-a-half, but never received a law degree. From 1963 until his death, Ford worked as the assistant director at Considine Recreation Center, the largest recreation center in Detroit. At the time of his death 16 months later, he was described in obituaries as the assistant recreation director for the City of Detroit. Sports writer Chuck Heaton wrote that Ford's life was \\"pretty much down hill\\" after he retired from professional football. Heaton recalled that, in his later years, Ford seemed in poor physical condition, \\"only a shadow of the mighty end he once was.\\" Ford still aspired to obtain his law license, but, according to Heaton, \\"appeared to have lost the drive which made him such a great football player.\\" Don Newcombe, who became good friends with Ford, was more blunt. Interviewed in 1980, Newcombe said that Ford's life was \\"decimated\\" because of alcohol. Newcombe added: \\"He became a wino, stumbling around in alleys. He gave up his life for alcohol.\\" Ford suffered a heart attack in early March 1972 and died the following week at Detroit General Hospital. He was age 46 at the time of his death.

Floyd Kalber (December 23, 1924 ‚Äì May 13, 2004) was an American television journalist and anchorman, nicknamed \\"The Big Tuna.\\" Life and career Born in Omaha, Nebraska, he spent two years in the army during World War II and began his television career as KMTV-Omaha's first newscaster. It was at KMTV that he mentored his most famous prot√©g√©, Tom Brokaw. Having attracted national attention for his coverage of the manhunt for mass-murderers Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate, in 1962 he became a popular anchorman for WNBQ-TV (later known as WMAQ), NBC's owned-and-operated station in Chicago. The 10pm broadcast on weeknights, NBC News Night Report, quickly became Chicago's top-rated news program and at one point, the most watched television program in the city. It continued its ratings lead until WLS' introduction of the so-called \\"happy talk\\" news format in 1968. In the late 1960s, Kalber also began doing five- minute news digests in early and late afternoon timeslots on NBC, during which a national audience became familiar with his work. At various points in the 1970s, he anchored weekend broadcasts of NBC Nightly News. In 1975 WMAQ paired Kalber with the then unknown Jane Pauley, who was recruited from WISH in Indianapolis; this arrangement did not succeed. Pauley left a year later to become the new co-anchor for NBC's Today Show. Moving to national broadcasting for the NBC television network, Kalber was one of the most visible broadcasters in the country from 1976-1981 while anchoring the news on Today, working with hosts Brokaw and Pauley. Kalber was unhappy at the Today show, and he left the program in late 1979. He remained with NBC News as a correspondent, after which he retired from the network in 1981. Kalber was coaxed back to broadcasting in 1984 by Chicago station WLS where he anchored the 6 p.m. evening newscast until his final retirement in 1998. He died at his suburban Chicago home on May 13, 2004, after a long battle with emphysema. He was 79.

Nan Tien is one of the branch temples of the Taiwanese Fo Guang Shan Buddhist order, founded in 1967 by Hsing Yun, which has over 120 branches worldwide. The temple is one of the largest Buddhist temples in the southern hemisphere. History The main temple The 8 Level Pagoda that is located within the Nan Tien complex Tourists visiting the temple complex It was founded by and constructed under the auspices of the Mahayana Buddhist organization known as Fo Guang Shan, and completed in 1995. The organization itself was founded in Taiwan in 1967 by Venerable Master Hsing Yun, and has 120 branches throughout the world. Fo Guang Shan Buddhism is rooted in the Mahayana tradition which emphasises that Buddhahood is within everyone's potential reach. Fo Guang Shan followers strive to bring Buddhism into daily life and describe their philosophy as \\"Humanistic Buddhism\\". The site of the Australian branch's temple was reputedly chosen by Hsing Yun due to its proximity to Mount Kembla, which is said to have an auspicious resemblance to a recumbent lion. It overlooks both Mount Keira and Mount Kembla. The land which the temple stands on was donated by Frank Arkell. The hill behind the temple is on a 100 year lease from the local government so as to preserve the serenity of the temple's surroundings. The temple pays a rent of one dollar a year to maintain the lease. Temple complex The Nan Tien complex is a Chinese-styled palace structure built using modern architectural techniques. Designed by Australian architects, Jones Brewster Regan and built by Australian construction workers, it occupies a semi-rural hillside site several square kilometres in size, and is set amidst landscaped gardens. In addition to various meeting rooms, a museum, cultural, conference and accommodation facilities and a restaurant, the Nan Tien temple complex includes two massive prayer halls (known as the Great Mercy Shrine and the Great Hero Hall) within which are located multiple monumental Buddha and Bodhisattva statues, as well as an eight-level pagoda, serving as a columbarium intended to house the cremated remains of 7000 people. The front hall houses the Thousand Handed Avalokitesvara (known as Kuan Yin in Chinese culture) and the main hall in the back houses the Five Dhyani Buddhas, Amogasiddhi, Ratnasambhava, Vairocana, Amitabha and Akshobhya. Both halls have thousands of tiny statues of Buddha on the walls. The complex also has amenities for monks, nuns and visitors, and a large garden with a pagoda. The architecture of the complex is notable because it incorporates the features of several styles of Buddhism. The pagoda is distinctly Chinese, with flying eaves and an angular profile. The main temples incorporates features of Tibetan monastic architecture, with multi-storey painted temple buildings set atop high stone platforms (see the Potala Palace). The courtyards feature Japanese-style gardens, while the statues and shrines often incorporate bright, South-East Asian colour schemes, in contrast to the more austere styles favoured in China. Tourism The temple is one of Wollongong's major tourist attractions, and conducts regular weekend retreats for visitors interested in Buddhism in general, and Chinese culture in particular. Retreats can involve classes in t'ai chi, calligraphy and meditation. Accommodation for retreat participants and members of the general public is available at the Pilgrim Lodge, a 100-room motel-style facility located in the temple grounds adjacent to its large lotus pond. It is regarded as an \\"orthodox\\" Buddhist temple by local Chinese Buddhists, in contrast with some other shrines which worship Buddhist, Taoist, and mystical heroes in the same building. It frequently hosts festivals. University Nan Tien Institute (NTI) is a private, not for profit, government accredited higher education provider offering studies in the areas of Buddhist studies, health and wellbeing, within an environment that incorporates contemplative education. NTI offers postgraduate programs in Applied Buddhist Studies, Health and Social Wellbeing, Humanistic Buddhism and Mental Health, as well as customised Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs and special interest subjects across the areas of meditation, mindfulness and health. It opened in 2015 and is located opposite the Nan Tien Temple across the Princes Motorway. A pedestrian bridge joining the university and the temple was completed in 2018.

The Jupiter-8 was Roland's flagship synthesizer for the first half of the 1980s. Although it lacked the soon-to-be standard of MIDI control, later production series of the Jupiter-8 did include Roland's proprietary DCB interface. The instrument had many advanced features for its time, including the ability to split the keyboard into two zones, with separate patches active on each zone. Two years after the release of the Jupiter-8, Roland released the more affordable Jupiter-6 synthesizer with built-in MIDI control but an otherwise slightly reduced set of features. In 2011, three decades after the release of the original Jupiter series, Roland released the fully digital Jupiter-80 and Jupiter-50 synthesizers as successors to the 1980s originals. They were in turn succeeded by the Jupiter-X and Jupiter-Xm in 2019. A Jupiter-8 plug-out was included already installed on the Roland System-8 synthesizer, in 2017. Features and architecture The Jupiter-8 is an 8-voice polyphonic analog synthesizer. Each voice features two discrete VCOs with cross-modulation and sync, pulse-width modulation, a non-resonant high-pass filter, a resonant Low- pass filter with 2-pole (12 dB/octave) and 4-pole (24 dB/octave) settings, an LFO with variable waveforms and routings, and two envelope generators (one invertible). Features include adjustable polyphonic portamento and a hold function for infinite sustain of notes and arpeggios. A versatile arpeggiator can be synchronized with external equipment by using the proprietary Roland DCB interface, clock input via CV jacks on the rear panel. An assignable bender can be used to control pitch or filter frequency. The Jupiter-8 includes balanced stereo XLR outputs as well as unbalanced 1/4\\" outputs. In addition to monophonic and polyphonic modes, the Jupiter-8 includes a unique polyphonic unison mode, in which all 16 oscillators can be stacked onto one note, but divide down if more keys are pressed. No other polyphonic synthesizer at the time had this feature. A Zilog Z80 CPU was used for managing storage of patches, scanning the keyboard and front-panel controls for changes, displaying the current patch number and other information on the display and taking care of the auto-tune function, among other operations. The VCF was based on the custom Roland IR3109 IC (also used in the filter circuits of the Jupiter-6, later Jupiter-4 and Promars units, MKS-80 rev 4, Juno-6/Juno-60/Juno-106, SH-101, MC-202, JX-3P and packaged in the 80017a chip used in the Juno-106 and MKS-30, among others). The VCA was the BA662, used also in Juno-6/60/106, JX-3P and TB-303. The envelopes were generated in hardware by the Roland IR3R01 chip (also in the Juno 6/60), and are much faster (1ms attack) than the software-generated envelopes used in the later Jupiter-6, Juno-106 and MKS-80 \\"Super Jupiter\\". Reliability There are claims that early models had unstable tuning, mainly due to DAC board resolution. Beginning with serial number 171700, the 12-bit DAC was upgraded to a 14-bit DAC. This increased the resolution of the CV voltages that control the analog circuitry. The soldered-in battery typically lasts ten years or more, ranking these boards among the lowest-maintenance of their generation. In the present day The wide range of sounds that the Jupiter-8 can produce, the efficient front panel layout (each synthesizer sound parameter adjustment had its own dedicated controller), and its sturdy construction, make the Jupiter-8 a venerable and desirable instrument even 35 years after it was first produced. Units in good condition still fetch more at auction than most new synthesizers, suggesting that the Jupiter-8 will continue to be heard for years to come. While the characteristic sound of the Jupiter-8 can be heard on many songs from the early 1980s onward, it is still being recorded to this day. For example, Alicia Keys can be seen playing one in the video for her number one hit \\"No One\\" from September 2007. Jupiter changes and successors The Roland JP-08 copies the Jupiter-8 voice architecture Throughout the production of the JP-8 there were several changes. Starting at serial #171700 the D/A converter on the Interface board was changed from 12-bit to 14-bit. This change was made mainly to improve tuning stability. The problem with the 12-bit digital-to-analog converter on the original JP-8 is that it could cause the autotune to be inaccurate in some instances. Some say to avoid these early JP-8's while others say they haven't experienced tuning problems. Starting at serial #242750 the LEDs of the display were changed to brighter ones. Starting at serial #282880 the JP-8 came standard with a DCB port. These newer JP-8's may be referred to as JP-8A's. DCB, or Digital Control Bus, was Roland's pre-MIDI interface that allowed the JP-8 to talk to other DCB enabled hardware, such as the Roland MC-4 and MC-8 microcomposers. Previous JP-8's had the option of having the OC-8 retrofit installed to give it DCB capability. The Jupiter-6 was released 2 years after the JP-8 and was an attempt at more affordable version of Roland's flagship. It features a similar voice architecture and appearance. It stored fewer patches, and had six voices. In order to make it cheaper to manufacture, a move towards integrated circuits (Curtis) was made, to replace discrete circuits used in JP-8's oscillators and amplifiers. The JP-6 is built using CEM3340 chip for its oscillators, and CEM3360 for its voltage controlled amplifiers. These changes imparted a change in sonic character, meaning that the JP-6 is not simply a less-expensive version of the JP-8, but an instrument with its own distinct sound. Additionally, the Jupiter-6 features a true multimode resonant filter, built-in MIDI, unison detune function and the ability to activate multiple waveforms on a single oscillator. The Roland MKS-80 \\"Super Jupiter\\" is a MIDI-controlled, rack-mountable sound module with a similar voice architecture to the Jupiter-8. However, its first released incarnation in 1984 (revision 3 and 4) used hardware identical to its predecessor, the Jupiter-6 (which had a combination of Curtis VCO and VCA chips combined with Roland's own proprietary filters). In 1985, Roland released another revision of the MKS-80, known as \\"Rev 5,\\" which used different VCO, VCA, and filter circuits. As a result, the MKS-80 Rev 5 can sound quite different from its predecessors. The Rev 5 filter was also used in the JX-8P, JX-10 and MKS-70 synthesizers. At the 2007 NAMM show, French music software manufacturer Arturia announced, and subsequently released a software Jupiter-8 called Jupiter-8V. A 2007 review in Sound on Sound stated, \\"8V sounds much like Jupiter 8, but does a zillion things that the original could not.\\" The Jupiter-8V is available in VST, AU, RTAS and AAX plugin formats. The Roland VariOS provides a mildly successful digital approximation of the Jupiter-8 using its \\"Varios-8\\" software. In 2011, Roland released the JUPITER-80 and JUPITER-50, which inherit much of the visual style of the Jupiter-8 and include Roland's SuperNATURAL, an extensive synthesis engine that includes virtual analog synthesis akin to a digital recreation of earlier Roland analog synths, as well as PCM-based recreations of purely digital synths by the company and acoustic modelling of real instruments. Emulations of the original Jupiter-8 sounds were later released as a software instrument for both keyboards on Roland Axial as part of the Synth Legends series. On October 1, 2015, Roland released the Boutique line of compact synthesizers, which includes the JP-08 unit which has the same parameters and sound design as the Roland Jupiter-8. It uses Roland's ACB technology (Analog Circuit Behavior), which emulates the behavior of each single component of the original Jupiter-8 circuit. However, the JP-08 has only half the polyphony of the Jupiter-8, with 4 voices. An evolution of the JP-08, closer to the original Jupiter-8 with 8 voices, was released in 2017 as plug-out synthesizer bundled as standard with the SYSTEM-8.

Silverman was involved with the series from the very beginning, animating all of the original short Simpsons cartoons that aired on The Tracey Ullman Show. He went on to serve as director of animation for several years. He also did the animation for the 2016 film, The Edge of Seventeen, which was produced by Gracie Films. Early life and career Silverman was born to a Jewish familyTampa Jewish Federation \\"Jews in the News: Oscar Time!\\" retrieved March 19, 2017 on Long Island, New York. He grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland and attended the University of Maryland, College Park for two years, focusing on art. He then attended UCLA and majored in animation.TFTAN - UCLA School of The Theater, Film and Television Alumni Network Early in his career with The Simpsons, he was a subject on the December 26, 1990 episode (#83) of To Tell the Truth.To Tell The Truth: 1990-91 Episode Guide The Simpsons Silverman is largely credited with creating most of the \\"rules\\" for drawing The Simpsons. He is frequently called upon to animate difficult or especially important scenes, becoming go-to in Season 2 when he animated the first of Homer's many \\"rants, freak-outs, and heart attacks\\". He appeared during the end credits of the Simpsons episode \\"Goo Goo Gai Pan\\" giving a quick method of drawing Bart, and is a frequent participant on the Simpsons DVD audio commentaries. A cartoon rendering of him can be seen in \\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\\", where he is the animator who draws Poochie (along with renderings of other Simpsons staffers). He was credited as Pound Foolish as the director of the episodes \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\" and \\"Another Simpsons Clip Show.\\" Silverman is also the director of The Simpsons Movie, which was released July 27, 2007. He originally left The Simpsons to direct additional sequences in The Road to El Dorado for DreamWorks Animation. Some of his other film work includes Monsters, Inc. for Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar, for which he was a co- director. He is currently a consulting producer and occasional director. He also worked on the animated films Ice Age, Robots, and Looney Tunes: Back in Action. In 2012, Silverman directed the theatrical short The Longest Daycare starring Maggie Simpson, released in front of Ice Age: Continental Drift. The short was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. He also directed the follow-up theatrical short Playdate with Destiny in 2020, released in front of Onward.

It frequently recalls the works of Ward Kimball, Tex Avery, Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones. His most prolific period of work on The Simpsons can be roughly categorized as beginning with the \\"Tracey Ullman\\" episodes and ending in or around season eight of the series, for which he animated Homer's psychedelic dream in \\"El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)\\". Other representative examples of Silverman's work on The Simpsons include Homer's histrionic, spasmodic heart attack in \\"Homer's Triple Bypass\\", Homer's demented hysterics over the iconic painting of poker-playing canines in \\"Treehouse of Horror IV\\" and subsequent turn as an even-more- deranged appropriation of Jack Nicholson's character from \\"The Shining\\" in \\"Treehouse of Horror V\\", and Homer's archetypically cartoonish reaction to Bart's prescription of Focusyn in \\"Brother's Little Helper\\".

It is Canada's representative member of the International Federation of American Football (IFAF), the world's governing body for American football, although it focuses primarily its own Canadian form of the game. Football Canada is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario. History The organization now known as Football Canada was founded on June 12, 1880 as the Canadian Rugby Football Union, revived on February 7, 1884 and re-organized as the Canadian Rugby Union on December 19, 1891. The CRU was founded to govern a sport which at the time had rules similar to the rugby football being played in the United Kingdom. In 1909, Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, then Governor General of Canada, donated a trophy to the CRU to be awarded for the Rugby Football Championship of Canada. This trophy became known as the Grey Cup. Even by this time however, the rules being played in Canada were vastly different from the rules used in countries that were part of the International Rugby Board (IRB). In the years that followed, the CRU made numerous rule changes that resulted in a game reasonably similar to the American one, but unrecognizable to a rugby union enthusiast. Despite the divergence, the sport continued to be referred to as rugby for many years, and the CRU did not change its name despite the obvious confusion (and thus rugby union was known as English rugby in Canada). By the 1940s, however, another development was to cause further changes to the CRU's mandate. It was now clear that two of its member leagues, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union in eastern Canada and the Western Interprovincial Football Union in the West were far more competitive than other circuits. By the 1950s, the two major unions had become openly professional, and in 1956 formed the Canadian Football Council (CFC) as an umbrella organization. In 1958, the CFC seceded from the CRU and became the Canadian Football League, which assumed control of the Grey Cup (though the amateurs had effectively been locked out since 1954). As an organization with no direct jurisdiction over the professional clubs and having become a distinct sport from rugby union by this time, the CRU finally changed its name to the Canadian Amateur Football Association (CAFA) in 1967. The CAFA changed its name again, to Football Canada in 1986. In French, its name had long been Football Canada. As of 2005 Football Canada is primarily responsible for running amateur football in Canada, including the national amateur football championships. It is actively trying to foster closer working relationships with both the CFL and the National Football League. right Members * British Columbia Provincial Football Association * Football Alberta * Football Saskatchewan * Football Manitoba * Ontario Football Alliance * Football Quebec * Football New Brunswick * Football Prince Edward Island * Football Newfoundland and Labrador * Football Nova Scotia National Championships * Football Canada Cup * Flag Football National Championships * 6 Nations Challenge * Women's Challenge Cup National Teams Men's * Junior National Team * Senior Flag Football National Team Women's * Women's National Team * Senior Flag Football National Team Former National Teams * Senior National Men's Team International Bowl Series First played in 2014, the annual International Bowl series is a collaboration between Football Canada and USA Football featuring a series of exhibition games between the rival football nations in Texas in January and February.

His family wanted him to become a minister, but he had theatrical ambitions, and was able to secure a position in a traveling show while on a trip to Chicago, Illinois. He eventually gained a recording contract, just a few years after records began to become popular. Though most of his recordings were not best sellers, he is notable for being the first singer to record a blues song, the \\"Memphis Blues\\" by W.C.

The 'Blues' style of singing and playing, which became so familiar later, was just about to be born. Even the dance records of 'The Memphis Blues' made during that period were played as straight one-steps. However, there were a few good old-fashioned 'trombone smears' in the orchestral effects of my 'Memphis Blues' record.\\"Tim Gracyk's Phonographs, Singers, and Old Records - Morton Harvey, First to Sing a Blues Tune on a Record Harvey is also notable for recording the antiwar protest song ‚ÄúI Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier‚Äù in 1915. The song became a hit as, at the time, the majority of Americans wanted the United States to stay out of World War I.

There is some dispute as to whether he was a baritone or tenor. Later years and death Harvey remained a vaudeville performer through the mid-1920s, often as half of a duet. He also performed with his new wife, Betty Baxter, on occasion. After his retirement from show business, he moved to Oklahoma where he managed a radio station.Tim Gracyk's Phonographs, Singers, and Old Records - Morton Harvey, First to Sing a Blues Tune on a Record In 1941 after the outbreak of World War II, he moved to San Francisco, California, where he served as director of job relations at the War Manpower Commission, and then as personnel director of an Army hospital. In 1946 he opened a photography studio in Los Gatos, California and photographed the Santa Clara Valley. Even after he moved onto other careers, he still continued to sing and write songs in his spare time. Harvey died in Los Gatos, California on August 15, 1961.

Biography Martin Linge was born in Norddal, M√∏re og Romsdal County, Norway. In 1915 he graduated as a non-commissioned officer from the military school in Trondheim. He subsequently studied at the Trondheim Theatre (1917‚Äì1918). He debuted on the stage at the Central Theatre in Oslo in 1921 and appeared in both theatre and films during the 1920s and 1930s. Martin Linge was father of Jan Herman Linge, an engineer and boat designer. He was also the grandfather of Norwegian novelist Espen Haavardsholm, who wrote about his grandfather in Martin Linge ‚Äì min morfar. Familieroman med fotografier (Gyldendal norsk forlag. 1993). Military career Shortly after the German attack on Norway on 9 April 1940 he traveled to √Öndalsnes to join his regiment. He had previously attained the rank of Lieutenant (in the reserve forces), and was also one of the first Norwegians to obtain license as a pilot. When British troops landed at √Öndalsnes from 17 April, Linge became liaison officer between the local regiment and the British. √Öndalsnes (and other towns in M√∏re og Romsdal county) was at this time still unoccupied territory and the only port with railway connections to the East Norway and the campaign there. The King, the crown prince, the cabinet, Norway's gold and cash holdings, and finally general Otto Ruge with staff, escaped through √Öndalsnes. Trygve Lie in his memoirs recalls meeting Linge at √Öndalsnes. During German air bombing of a makeshift airfield at Setnesmoen, he was wounded and evacuated by boat to Britain. He was the first wounded Norwegian soldier to arrive in Britain.Haavardsholm, Espen: Martin Linge ‚Äì min morfar. Familieroman med fotografier. Oktober forlag, 2007 Among exiled Norwegians, Linge along with Nordahl Grieg and Olav Rytter were the first to propose ideas for resistance against the German occupation. \\"Our land is perfect for secret resistance and guerrilla warfare\\" he declared in June 1940. In August 1940 he was appointed as liaison officer to the War Office and soon began recruiting men and organizing what became Norwegian Independent Company 1. Linge was killed during Operation Archery, a British Combined Operations raid at M√•l√∏y against German military positions on V√•gs√∏y Island. During the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, M√•l√∏y was used as a German coastal fortress, which had led to the eradication of all settlement on the island to make room for the fortress. His body is buried at the Vestre gravlund (Western Cemetery) in Oslo. Subsequently the unit he had led was named Kompani Linge in his honor. Linge Company was more formally known as Lingekompaniet (The Linge Company) ('-et' being the definite article suffix), by Norwegians. He was awarded Norway's highest military decoration for gallantry, the War Cross with sword.

A member of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party, he represented North Dakota in the U.S. House of Representatives (1959‚Äì1960) and the U.S. Senate (1960‚Äì1992). At the time of his death, he was the third longest-serving senator (after Strom Thurmond and Robert Byrd) among current members of the Senate. Early life and education Quentin Burdick was born in Munich, North Dakota, as the oldest of three children of Usher Lloyd Burdick and Emma Cecelia Robertson. His father was a Republican politician who served as Lieutenant Governor of North Dakota (1911‚Äì1913) and a U.S. Representative (1935‚Äì1959). His mother was the daughter of the first white settler in the area of North Dakota that lies west of Park River. He was the brother of Eugene Allan Burdick, who was judge of the Fifth Judicial District of North Dakota from 1953 to 1978. His sister Rosemary was married to Robert W. Levering, who was a U.S. Representative from Ohio (1959‚Äì1961). In 1910, Burdick moved with his family to Williston, where his father engaged in farming and practiced law. As a child, he enjoyed breaking wild ponies on his father's ranch. He attended local public schools, and graduated in 1926 from Williston High School, where he was class president and captain of the football team. Burdick had his undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1931. During college, he played on the football team as a blocking back for Bronko Nagurski, and was president of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He suffered a knee injury in football that disqualified him from military service in World War II. In 1932, he received his law degree from the University of Minnesota Law School and was admitted to the bar. Early career Burdick joined his father's law firm in Fargo, where he advised farmers who were threatened with foreclosure during the years of the Great Depression. He later recalled, \\"I guess I acquired a social conscience during those bad days, and ever since I've had the desire to work toward bettering the living conditions of the people.\\" In 1933, he married Marietta Janecky; the couple had one son and three daughters. She died in 1958. Like his father, Burdick became active in politics and joined the Nonpartisan League (NPL), a populist-progressive group which was allied with the Republican Party. As a candidate for the NPL, he unsuccessfully ran for attorney general in 1934 and 1940, state senator from Cass County in 1936, and lieutenant governor in 1942. Burdick, who believed the NPL was dividing the state's progressive vote, began to advocate aligning the NPL with the Democratic Party. He subsequently ran for Governor of North Dakota in 1946 as a Democrat, but was again unsuccessful. He was a delegate for former Vice President Henry A. Wallace, who ran as a candidate of the Progressive Party, in the 1948 presidential election. In 1956, the NPL aligned with the Democratic Party to create the North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party. That same year, Burdick suffered his sixth and final electoral defeat when he ran against Republican incumbent Milton Young for the U.S. Senate. Congressional career=U.S. House of Representatives In the spring of 1958, Usher Burdick, who worried about being defeated for re-election in the Republican primary, offered to withdraw his candidacy if the NPL agreed to support his son as the Democratic-NPL candidate for his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Quentin subsequently received the NPL endorsement in April, and was elected to North Dakota's At-large congressional district the following November. He was the first Democrat-NPLer to be elected to the House of Representatives from North Dakota. During his tenure in the House, Burdick served as a member of the House Interior Committee, where he promoted the Garrison Diversion Project to provide water from the Missouri River to North Dakota. He received high ratings from organized labor and the Americans for Democratic Action. An opponent of the Eisenhower administration's farm policies, in his maiden speech on the House floor, Burdick called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson. U.S. Senate After the death of Senator William Langer in November 1959, Burdick ran in a special election on June 28, 1960 to fill the remaining four and a half years of Langer's term. His Republican opponent was Governor John E. Davis. During the campaign, Burdick received strong support from the National Farmers Union. He called for high price supports and strict production controls on grains with high surpluses. His campaign slogan, \\"Beat Benson with Burdick\\", referred to Agriculture Secretary Benson, whose policies were unpopular with the state's wheat farmers. Burdick narrowly defeated Davis by a margin of 1,118 votes. Nine days after the election, the widower married Jocelyn Birch Peterson. She had two children from a previous marriage. Together the couple had one son. On August 8, 1960, Burdick resigned his House seat and was sworn in as a member of the U.S. Senate. He secured a full six- year term in the heavily Democratic year of 1964, having defeated Republican Thomas Kleppe. Burdick easily defeated Kleppe in a rematch in 1970, another national Democratic year. He continued to be reelected by wide margins in 1976, 1982, and 1988. In 1987, Burdick became the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Burdick earned the nickname the \\"King of Pork\\" for focusing nearly all of his legislative efforts on bringing federal funds to North Dakota, which was rural, poor, and less developed than many other states. Death In September 1992, at age 84, Burdick died from heart failure, while at St. Luke's Hospital in Fargo. After Burdick's death, his widow, Jocelyn Burdick, was appointed by Governor George Sinner to fill his unexpired term until a special election was held.

M√•l√∏y is located on the southeastern side of the island of V√•gs√∏y, about northeast of the village of Holvika and about south of the village of Raudeberg. The M√•l√∏y Bridge connects the town centre to the area of Deknepollen on the mainland. S√∏r-V√•gs√∏y Church is located in M√•l√∏y. M√•l√∏y is one of the most important fishing ports in Norway. In 1997, M√•l√∏y was granted town status by the municipality. The town has a population (2018) of 3,283 and a population density of . Prior to 2020, the town was also the administrative centre of the old V√•gs√∏y Municipality. History View of M√•l√∏y town from the harbour M√•l√∏y was founded as a trading center on the small island of Mold√∏en, or M√•l√∏ya, on the Ulvesundet strait between V√•gs√∏y island and the mainland. As trade flourished, the town gradually moved to the larger island of V√•gs√∏y, while keeping the name of the smaller island. This is the cause of some confusion, although the smaller island is today often known as \\"Lisje-M√•l√∏yna\\" (literally smaller M√•l√∏y) or \\"√òyna\\" (literally the island). During World War II, it was used as a German coastal fortress, which led to the eradication of all settlement on the island to make room for the fortress, and as a result of Operation Archery in December 1941. M√•l√∏y was the administrative centre of the old municipality of S√∏r-V√•gs√∏y which existed from 1910 until 1964, and it was then made the administrative centre of the new V√•gs√∏y municipality which was created in 1964. In 2020, V√•gs√∏y was merged with Flora Municipality to form the new Kinn Municipality. At that time, M√•l√∏y lost its administrative centre status. Townscape The town square in M√•l√∏y has a monument remembering the citizens of S√∏r-V√•gs√∏y and Davik municipalities who died in World War II. Another monument, located elsewhere in the town, is a memorial to Martin Linge, the only Norwegian who died during Operation Archery. Few streets in M√•l√∏y are named; most, especially the ones on the hillside, are only numbered. Culture The festival M√•l√∏ydagene is arranged in the town every year. In 2004, M√•l√∏y was awarded the role as a 2008 Tall Ships' Races main port. The town was the host of the participating tall ships from July 28 until August 4. The event had a budget of , of which the county government would sponsor . The town offered great hospitality and welcomed crews warmly. The town, with STI had organized much in the way of crew activities. Education The only upper secondary school in the municipality, M√•l√∏y vidareg√•ande skule, as well as several lower secondary schools and elementary schools, are located in the vicinity of the town. The closest institutions of higher education are Sogn og Fjordane University College, located in Sogndal, F√∏rde, and Sandane, √Ölesund University College in √Ölesund, and the University of Bergen in Bergen.

Nicholas Station, 1890s Nevsky Prospect () is the main street (high street) in the federal city of St. Petersburg in Russia. It takes its name from the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, the monastery which stands at the eastern end of the street, and which in turn commemorates the Russian hero Prince Saint Alexander Nevsky (1221-1263). Following his founding of Saint Petersburg in 1703, Tsar Peter I planned the course of the street as the beginning of the road to Novgorod and Moscow. The avenue runs from the Admiralty in the west to the Moscow Railway Station and, after veering slightly southwards at Vosstaniya Square, to the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. Major sights include the Rastrelliesque Stroganov Palace, the huge neoclassical Kazan Cathedral, the Art Nouveau Bookhouse (originally the Singer House), Elisseeff Emporium, half a dozen 18th-century churches, a monument to Catherine the Great, an enormous 18th-century shopping mall, a mid-19th- century department store, the Russian National Library, and the Anichkov Bridge with its horse statues. Nikolai Gogol described the feverish life of the avenue in his story \\"Nevsky Prospekt\\", published in 1835. Fyodor Dostoevsky often employed Nevsky Prospekt as a setting in his works, such as Crime and Punishment (1866) and The Double: A Petersburg Poem (1846). The caf√©-restaurant which the famous writers of the 19th-century Golden Age of the Russian literature frequented still remains as \\"Literary Cafe\\" on Nevsky Prospect. During the early Soviet years (1918‚Äì44) the name of Nevsky Prospect was changed, first and briefly to \\"Proletkult Street\\" (Ulitsa Proletkul'ta) in honor of that Soviet artistic organization.Lynn Mally, Culture of the Future: The Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1990; pg. 44. Following the demise of Proletkult already around 1920 the name was changed again, this time to \\"Avenue of the 25th of October\\", alluding to the day of the October Revolution: the name never took on in the daily language of the city's inhabitants who continued to use the pre-revolutionary name. During the siege of Leningrad (1941‚Äì1944) some walls on the north side of Nevsky Prospect were stencilled with the inscription \\"Citizens! During shelling this side of the street is the most dangerous\\", warning passers-by of the areas most at risk from German artillery bombardment. In 1962, the inscription was recreated on school building No. 210 on Nevsky Prospect through the initiative of poet Mikhail Dudin. The inscription, and other examples across the city, are considered war memorials and are frequently the site of commemorations of the siege. In January 2019 Governor of Saint Petersburg Alexander Beglov laid flowers at the inscription on Nevsky Prospect. At the end of the siege of Leningrad, in January 1944, the name Nevsky Prospect was formally restored and has remained ever since.http://www.hellopiter.ru/The_neva_prospectus.html The Nevsky today functions as the main thoroughfare in Saint Petersburg. The majority of the city's shopping and nightlife takes place on or immediately off Nevsky Prospekt. The street is served by the stations Admiralteyskaya, Nevsky Prospekt, Gostiny Dvor, Mayakovskaya, Ploshchad Vosstaniya and Ploshchad Alexandra Nevskogo I of Saint Petersburg Metro.

A Democrat, he was elected to two terms each in both houses of Congress. Early years Dill was born in Fredericktown, Ohio, and attended Ohio Wesleyan University, where he was a member of the social fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. Grand Catalogue of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity: February 1, 1910, page 124 He completed his undergraduate work at the University of Delaware in 1907. As a young man, Dill was a teacher, and moved west to Spokane, Washington, in 1908. He taught English at South Central High School and was a newspaper reporter at The Spokesman-Review in the summer. Political career Dill became a lawyer in 1910, and soon entered politics. He was elected to the U.S. House in 1914 and 1916 from the newly created fifth district. On April 5, 1917, Dill was one of 50 representatives who voted against declaring war on Germany. His vote was controversial among his constituents, including members of his own party. The Spokane County Democratic Committee debated censuring Dill, but ultimately voted against doing so. Dill was narrowly defeated for re-election in 1918 by state supreme court justice J. Stanley Webster. Dill was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1922, beating two-term incumbent Republican Miles Poindexter. Dill campaigned as a supporter of Progressive reform and pledged to repeal the Esch‚ÄìCummins Act and push for the Columbia Basin Project. Poindexter, who was supported by major newspapers such as The Spokesman-Review and The Seattle Times, attempted to portray Dill as a radical for his war record and his support of the Plumb Plan. Dill carried Spokane County, much of Eastern Washington, and the urban counties of the Puget Sound region. Dill was re- elected in 1928, but did not seek a third term in 1934. His election in 1928 marked the last time a candidate from Eastern Washington was elected U.S. Senator. In the Senate, he was the chief sponsor of both the 1927 Radio Act and the 1934 Communications Act, and was a staunch proponent of the Grand Coulee Dam. In June 1934, Congress amended the Watson-Parker Railway Labor Act so it explicitly included non-operating train personnel and sleeping car companies. Senator Dill sponsored the new act since he thought Pullman porters and maids should be black. A jurisdictional dispute between the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters had to be first settled in the American Federation of Labor, but the effect was to quadruple membership in the Brotherhood. Black workers could now join the union without fear of losing their jobs. Dill ran for governor in 1940 but was narrowly defeated by Republican Arthur B. Langlie. His last attempt at elective office was for the open seat in Congress from Spokane's fifth district in 1942, but was easily defeated by Walt Horan, the first Republican to win that district in twenty years. Horan had lost to Charles Leavy by eleven points in the previous race in 1940. Dill then served as a member of the Columbia Basin Commission from 1945 to 1948, and as a special assistant to the U.S. Attorney General from 1946 to 1953. In between all of these jobs, he usually practiced law. He died in 1978 in Spokane at the age of 93, the last living U.S. Senator elected before the Great Depression. Personal After he left the Senate, Dill sought a divorce from his wife in 1936, the feminist suffragist and author Rosalie Gardiner Jones of New York. Dill claimed that Jones told his friends that he was \\"a political coward\\" for not seeking re- election in 1934, and that she buried dogs and garbage in the backyard. Separated while he was still in office, the well-publicized divorce proceedings began in late June 1936 in Spokane. The court found in his favor, he kept the house, she got the furniture. Dill met home economics educator Mabel Aileen Dickson (1905-1969) in November 1936 in Washington, DC, and they were married in May 1939. Born in Crystal, North Dakota, she was raised in Canada; Dickson graduated from the University of Alberta in Edmonton and earned a master's degree at Washington State College in Pullman. They were married for thirty years, until her death from a heart ailment. Their home, Cliff Aerie, built in 1941 at 708 W. Cliff Drive, is a Spokane landmark.

He was appointed as Marshal of Poland by Joseph Stalin, and served in this position from 1945 until his death. He supported the 1981 imposition of Martial law in Poland. Biography Rola-≈ªymierski during the Potsdam Conference in Germany. Rola-≈ªymierski was born Micha≈Ç ≈Åy≈ºwi≈Ñski in Krak√≥w under the Austrian Partition, to the family of railway clerk, Wojciech ≈Åy≈ºwi≈Ñski. At the age of 20, he enrolled at the law faculty of the Jagiellonian University in 1910, but was drafted a year later. After his brother committed a widely publicised murder-robbery in Krak√≥w, he began to call himself ≈ªymierski around 1913. When World War I erupted in 1914, he joined the Polish Legions, and fought with distinction on many of the most important battlefields of the Austro-Hungarian Eastern Front. After the Oath Crisis of 1917, he retired from the Austro-Hungarian army and returned to Krak√≥w, where he graduated from the Krak√≥w Trading School. In 1918, he joined the reborn Polish Army and took part in the Polish-Soviet War. He initially commanded the II Infantry Brigade and was then promoted to commander of the prestigious Polish Legions 2nd Infantry Division. After the war, he was sent to Paris, where he graduated from √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. Upon his return, he was promoted to General. ≈ªymierski served in Warsaw as the Deputy Chief of Administration of the Polish Army. During the 1926 coup d'√©tat, he defended the democratically elected government of Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski. After the coup, in 1927, the new sanacja regime of Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski charged him with bribery and embezzlement. Following an official investigation, he was court-martialled and demoted to private first class, expelled from the army and sentenced to five years in prison. Upon his release in 1931, ≈ªymierski went to France. He was recruited by Soviet intelligence and became a well-paid secret agent delivering information about the Franco-Polish alliance. He joined the Communist Party of Poland. His secret engagement with Moscow was discontinued when Stalin ordered the dissolution of the Polish Communist Party (KPP) in 1938 during the Great Purge. World War II ≈ªymierski returned to Poland shortly before the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland at the onset of World War II, and soon resumed his clandestine work for the NKVD (as revealed first by J√≥zef ≈öwiat≈Ço). Under the pseudonym \\"Rola\\", he engaged in the Soviet dealings with Nazi German Gestapo secret police. In 1943, by Soviet executive order, he was named the deputy commander of the Communist and Soviet-backed Gwardia Ludowa, and from 1944, the commander of Armia Ludowa. He was promoted by the Communist-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation back to the rank of General and became the commander-in-chief of the Polish Army fighting alongside the Soviet Union (the Polish Armed Forces in the East). He was Minister of Defence in the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland (RzƒÖd Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej, January-June 1945). On May 3, 1945, by order of Stalin, he was promoted to the rank of Marshal of Poland. Karol ≈öwierczewski, Marian Spychalski and Micha≈Ç Rola-≈ªymierski standing on the Lusatian Neisse river. From 1946, ≈ªymierski served as head of the Commission of State Security. He was responsible for repressions against the former resistance fighters, members of the Polish 2nd Corps and non-communist politicians, as well as for the deployment of the Polish Army against Poland's Freedom and Independence fighters; and the roundup of Ukrainian families in Operation Vistula against the OUN-UPA. Until 1949, he also held the post of Minister of National Defence. In this year, he was replaced by the Polish-born Soviet Marshal, Konstanty Rokossowski, who received the rank of Marshal of Poland and held his office until 1956. As a consequence of Stalinist purges organised in Poland by Boles≈Çaw Bierut, ≈ªymierski was arrested in 1952. However, he was released in 1955 without any charges. He was rehabilitated by the Polish government in 1956. After the end of Stalinism in Poland, he held various posts, including deputy head of the National Bank of Poland (between 1956 and 1967) and the honorary head of the ZBoWiD (Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy, an organisation of Polish war veterans). He was also a member of the Polish United Workers' Party and, after Wojciech Jaruzelski's introduction of martial law in Poland, ≈ªymierski also became a member of its Central Committee and of the Front of National Unity. He died in Warsaw on October 15, 1989. He was the last person to hold the rank of Marshal of Poland.

Born in Isfahan to an Iranian family from Tehran, the family had settled in Bombay before moving to Karachi after the Partition of India. Ispahani joined a paramilitary women's force in 1950, but left a year later when she married Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. She moved to Oxfordshire with her husband who then was pursuing his legal education. She returned to Pakistan alongside Bhutto who went on to serve as the Foreign Minister. After her husband founded the Pakistan Peoples Party, Ispahani worked to lead the party's women's wing. After Bhutto was elected as the Prime Minister in 1971, Ispahani became the First Lady of Pakistan and remained so until her husband's removal in 1977. Her daughter, Benazir Bhutto immediately succeeded her husband as the leader of the Pakistan Peoples party and, while under house arrest, fought an unsuccessful legal battle to prevent her husband's execution. After Bhutto's execution, Ispahani, along with her children, went into exile to London, from where in 1981 she co-founded the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy, a nonviolent opposition to Zia's regime. Ispahani returned to Pakistan after her daughter Benazir made a comeback in 1986. After the People's Party's victory in 1988, she joined Benazir's cabinet as a minister without portfolio while representing Larkana District in the National Assembly. She remained in the cabinet until Benazir's government was dismissed in 1990. Afterwards, during a family dispute between her son, Murtaza, and her daughter, Benazir, Ispahani favoured Murtaza leading Benazir to sack Ispahani as the party leader. Ispahani stopped talking to the media and refrained from political engagements after the assassination of her son Murtaza in 1996 during a police encounter, during her daughter's second government. Ispahani moved to Dubai in 1996, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, she was kept out of public‚Äôs eye by Benazir until her demise on 23 October 2011. In Pakistan, Ispahani is remembered for her contribution to empowerment of women in Pakistan and for advocating for democracy in Pakistan, for which she is dubbed as \\"MƒÅdar-e-Jamhooriat\\" (English \\"Mother of Democracy\\"), a title she was honored with by the parliament following her death. Background Nusrat Ispahani was born on the 23 March 1929 in Esfahan, Iran, hailing from the wealthy Hariri family. Her father was a wealthy Iranian Kurdish businessman who initially lived in Bombay and then moved to Karachi before the independence of Pakistan and the Partition of India in 1947. Before emigrating to Pakistan, Nusrat attended and was educated at the University of Isfahan where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Humanities in 1950. Nusrat met Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in Karachi where they got married on 8 September 1951. She was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's second wife, and they had four children together: Benazir, Murtaza, Sanam and Shahnawaz. With the exception of Sanam, she outlived her children. Benazir's widower and Nusrat's son-in-law Asif Ali Zardari was the President of Pakistan from 9 September 2008 till 8 September 2013. Family and political career As first lady from 1973 to 1977, Nusrat Bhutto functioned as a political worker and accompanied her husband on a number of overseas visits. In 1979, after the trial and execution of her husband, she succeeded her husband as leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party as chairman for life. She led the PPP's campaign against General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's regime. Alongside her daughter Benazir Bhutto, she was arrested numerous times and placed under house arrest and in prison in Sihala. Nusrat Bhutto was attacked by police with batons while attending a cricket match at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, when the crowd began to raise pro Bhutto slogans. In 1982, ill with cancer, she was given permission to leave the country by the military government of General Zia-ul- Haq for medical treatment in London at which point her daughter, Benazir Bhutto, became acting leader of the party, and, by 1984, the party chairman. After returning to Pakistan in the late 1980s, she served two terms as a Member of Parliament to the National Assembly from the family constituency of Larkana, Sindh. During the administrations of her daughter Benazir, she became a cabinet minister and Deputy Prime Minister. In the 1990s, she and Benazir became estranged when Nusrat took the side of her son Murtaza during a family dispute but were later reconciled after Murtaza's murder. She lived the last few years of her life with her daughter's family in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and later suffered from the combined effects of a stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Illness and death Bhutto was suspected of suffering from cancer in 1982, the year when she left Pakistan for medical treatment. For the last several years of her life, she had also been suffering from Alzheimer's disease. In the mid-1990s, particularly after the death of her son Mir Murtaza Bhutto in 1996, she withdrew from public life. Party sources suggest this may also have coincided with the time that she began to show symptoms of Alzheimer's. According to her senior party leader, Bhutto's disease was so advanced that she was even unaware of the assassination of her daughter, Benazir. She used a ventilator until her last days. She died at the age of 82 in the Iranian Hospital Dubai on 23 October 2011. Her body was flown to her hometown of Garhi Khuda Bakhsh in the Larkana District the next day, and was buried next to her husband and children in the Bhutto family mausoleum at a ceremony attended by thousands of mourners.

In background, Warsaw's Royal Castle, where the Constitution has just been adopted. The Patriotic Party (), also known as the Patriot Party or, in English, as the Reform Party, was a political movement in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in the period of the Four-Year Sejm (Great Sejm) of 1788‚Äì92, whose chief achievement was the Constitution of 3 May 1791. The reformers aimed to strengthen the ailing political machinery of the Commonwealth, to bolster its military, and to reduce foreign political influence, particularly that of the Russian Empire. It has been called the first Polish political party, though it had no formal organizational structure. The Party was inspired by the ideals of the French Revolution, and its name, proudly used by themselves, was a tribute to the Dutch Patriots. The Patriotic Party ceased to exist soon after the adoption of the Constitution when, in the War in Defense of the Constitution, the Targowica Confederates, backed by the Russians, overthrew the reformed government. In 1795 the Third Partition of Poland ended the Commonwealth's independent existence. Many of the movement's leaders emigrated abroad. History=Background The reform movement were responding to the increasingly perilous situation of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, which only a century earlier had been a major European power and the largest state on the continent. By the early 17th century, the magnates of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state and they ensured that no reforms would be carried out that might weaken their privileged status (the \\"Golden Freedoms\\"). The peculiar parliamentary institution of the liberum veto (\\"free veto\\"), in effect since 1652, had in principle permitted any Sejm deputy to nullify all the legislation that had been adopted by that Sejm. Thanks to this device, deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers, or simply content to believe they were living in some kind of \\"Golden Age\\", paralyzed the Commonwealth's government for over a century . The government was near collapse, which gave rise to the term \\"Polish anarchy\\". The Enlightenment had gained great influence in certain Commonwealth circles during the reign (1764‚Äì95) of its last king, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. As a result, the King had proceeded with cautious reforms such as the establishment of fiscal and military ministries and a national customs tariff. However, the idea of reforms in the Commonwealth was viewed with growing suspicion not only by the magnates, but also by neighboring countries, which were content with the Commonwealth's contemporary state of affairs and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders. The first of the three successive 18th- century partitions of Commonwealth territory that would eventually blot Poland from the map of Europe shocked the inhabitants of the Commonwealth, and made it clear to progressively minded individuals that the Commonwealth must either reform or perish. Even before the First Partition, a Sejm deputy had been sent to ask the French philosophes, Gabriel Bonnot de Mably and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, to draw up a tentative constitutions for a new Poland. Mably had submitted his recommendations in 1770‚Äì71; Rousseau had finished his (Considerations on the Government of Poland) in 1772, when the First Partition was already underway. Supported by the more progressive magnates, such as the Czartoryski family, and King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, a new wave of reforms was introduced. A major opportunity for reform seemed to present itself during the \\"Great\\" or \\"Four-Year Sejm\\" of 1788‚Äì92, which opened on 6 October 1788. Events in the world now played into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars ‚Äì Prussia with France, Russia and Austria with the Ottoman Empire ‚Äì and with their own internal troubles, to intervene forcibly in Poland. The new alliance between the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and Prussia seemed to provide security against Russian intervention. Reforms and successes The Party was established during the Four-Year Sejm (Great Sejm) of 1788‚Äì92 by individuals that sought reforms aimed at bolstering the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, including seeking to reassert Poland's independence from the Russian Empire. Its aim was to draft and pass legislation to fix the ailing Commonwealth. The Party worked to abolish the magnate and Russian dominated Permanent Council, and to enlarge the Polish Army. The Party was modeled after similar organization that recently began operating in revolutionary France. The party received support from all strata of Polish‚ÄìLithuanian society, from societal and political elites, including some magnates, through Piarist Enlightened Catholics, to the radical left. The Party's conservative, or right, wing, led by progressive magnates such as Ignacy Potocki, his brother Stanis≈Çaw Kostka Potocki and Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, sought alliance with Prussia and advocated opposing King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. The Party's centrists, including Stanis≈Çaw Ma≈Çachowski, wished accommodation with the King. The liberal left wing (the Polish Jacobins), led by Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj (hence also known as \\"Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj's Forge\\"), looked for support to the people of Warsaw. The Forge was among the most active and notable groups in the reform movement, and has been said to have acted as the party's political agitators. The Forge's proposals were highly refined; Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj's \\"Political Law\\", which included a proposal for a new constitution, became a major inspiration for the debated new constitution. In 1790 the party acquired royal support, as the King joined the reformers. During the Four-Year Sejm, the Party secured various reforms such as improvement of the territorial administration, abolishment of the Permanent Council, increase of the army to 100,000 soldiers, and improved and increased taxation, with an income tax on Church and nobles. In its most important achievement, the Party secured adoption of the Constitution of 3 May 1791. The constitution further reformed the executive and legislature, notably abolishing the liberum veto and reintroducing hereditary monarchy to the Commonwealth. The Constitution has been described as one of the first modern constitutions, and one of the first attempts, outside France, to bring the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment to life. After the Constitution was passed, the Party formed the Society of Friends of the Government Ordinance (Zgromadzenie Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Konstytucji RzƒÖdowej), a political club, to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further, including economic, ones. The Party and the Society are often referred to as the first Polish political party. In the years 1791‚Äì1792 the Party was supported by a newspaper \\"Gazeta Narodowa i Obca\\", which can be seen as its informal press outlet. Opposition and failure The opponents to the Patriotic Party were mostly grouped in the Hetmans' Party (Stronnictwo hetma≈Ñskie), and included Hetmans Stanis≈Çaw Szczƒôsny Potocki, Franciszek Ksawery Branicki and Seweryn Rzewuski. They formed the Targowica Confederation in defense of the traditional Golden Liberties and the Cardinal Laws, and called on the Russian Empire for assistance. Empress Catherine II of Russia readily obliged, as she saw the Constitution as a threat to Russian influence in the Commonwealth, and a possible long-term danger to absolute monarchy in Russia itself. After the War in Defense of the Constitution, which was won by the Confederates and their Russian allies, the Patriotic Party's principal leaders ‚Äì Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj, Potocki, Ma≈Çachowski ‚Äì emigrated abroad, where they prepared the ground for the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising of 1794. The subsequent failure of that Uprising in turn led to the Third Partition of Poland, ending the existence of the Commonwealth. The Patriotic Party's attempts to reform the Commonwealth thus ultimately brought about its total demise.

From just three groups in 1993 it grew rapidly and today it is a nationwide federation made up of around 25 local groups, located throughout the entire country. Aside from the Samordningsgruppen, SOG; whose purpose is nothing but to coordinate the activities of the local clubs, several other committees serve various purposes within the federation, such as production of propaganda. SUF.cc - Addresser (it lists 25 local clubs) Ever since the early 1990s, the SUF published a magazine called Direkt Aktion. SUF is, in contrast to its anarcho-syndicalist beliefs, not a union. Their idea of anarcho-syndicalism expands beyond the daily labour union activity, and claims that in a global community where capitalist relations have expanded into all parts of society, a broader movement and a broader definition of class struggle is needed. Thus, they believe it is necessary to confront capitalism not only in workplaces, but also in schools, universities, local communities, etc.  Campaigns = Planka.nu  The network Planka.nu (Fare-dodge.now) was initially initiated as a campaign by SUF in 2001. The campaign (and later independent initiative) dealt with public transportation, seeking a shift from soaring prices to a tax-financed model. The campaign got a lot of attention because of the unorthodox methods; Planka.nu encourage people to fare-dodge in the public transport and organizes an insurance fund, p-kassan, that pays the fines of its members it they get caught fare-dodging.  Nu j√§vlar √§r det nog  Nu j√§vlar √§r det nog (It's enough now, damnit), was a nationwide anti- racist campaign initiated by SUF on August 24, 2004 and ended February 1, 2005. It claimed to be different from other anti-racist campaigns in that it also took in account factors such as social class.  Klasskampen tar inte semester  Klasskampen tar inte semester - \\"There is no vacation for the class struggle\\" - was SUF's nationwide campaign about summer jobs. It lasted for five months, from May 1 to October 1, 2005. It was criticized for allegedly encouraging people to commit illegal acts.  Osynliga Partiet  The nationwide campaign Osynliga partiet (the Invisible Party) was partly initiated by SUF. The campaign first received media attention when winner of the political reality show Toppkandidaterna, Petter Nilsson, donated part of his prize to SUF for financing part of the campaign, which was heavily criticized after the offices of the Centre Party were vandalized following their announcement of their intention to dismantle the Employment Security Act, with the logo of the campaign found at the site. In addition to this, a few offices of the Christian Democrats were also attacked.

() is a Taiwanese automaker and importer. Taiwan's biggest automaker as of 2010, Yulon is known for building Nissan models under license. The original romanization of the company's name is Yue Loong, but in 1992 the company renewed its logo and switched to the shorter Yulon name. Historically, it is one of Taiwan's \\"big four\\" automakers. The company has over time evolved as a holding company that encompassed multiple public entities such as China Motor Corporation, Yulon-Nissan Motor, Yulon Financial, Yulon RentalÔºåCarnival Industrial Corporation and others. The group currently has a rivalry with Hotai Motor Group as the two largest automotive centric conglomerates. Yulon created a new brand to sell self-designed cars, Luxgen, in 2010. As of 2017 it had a Revenue of NT$99 billion (US$3.4 billion) and about 12,680 employees. History Incorporated in September 1953 as a machinery company by Ching-Ling Yen, today Yulon Motor Co., Ltd. is part of the Yulon Group, a Taiwanese conglomerate. The company is associated with the creation of a Taiwanese auto industry aided by its government. This pattern is being again realized by Malaysia's Proton. During 1953‚Äì1960 an era of \\"passive protection\\" reigned and Yulon grew with the assistance of protectionary tariffs of 40‚Äì60%.Chen, Chia-wen, p. 24 Parts and components received substantially lower tariffs to help fledgling carmakers. Early on, Yulon looked for foreign partners, but it wasn't until 1956 that an American company, Willys, agreed to share technology. The next year Yulon began its long-lasting partnership with Nissan.Chen, Chia-wen , p. 26 While the first Yulon model was a 1956 jeep, with engine production beginning in September of that year, passenger car assembly only started in 1960 with the Bluebird after an agreement with Nissan was signed in 1957. While primarily building Nissan models and other cars under license, Yulon has designed and produced at least one original family car, the 1986 Feeling 101.Chen, Chia-wen, p. 93 (Yulon began producing wholly original products again starting in 2009 with the debut of its Luxgen brand.) Until the introduction of the Nissan branded Cefiro A32 (in February 1996), the various license-built Nissans had all been branded Yue Loong (Yulon after 1992). Assembler With production bases located in China, Philippines and Taiwan, Yulon makes license-built versions of many automakers' models. The companies it manufactures in cooperation with include Chrysler, Geely, GM, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi and Nissan. It assembles most of the vehicles from complete knock down kits. The company has used its design and engineering expertise to localize its manufactures to suit Taiwanese tastes. While Yulon continues to manufacture vehicles for sale on the Taiwanese market, as of 2010 it also imports Nissan, Infiniti, and Renault models for sale in the domestic Taiwanese market. Nissan Yulon has maintained a strong cooperative relationship with Nissan since 1957. After the 1985 passing of a Taiwanese act, the Automobile Industry Development Act (AIDA), Yulon accepted Nissan taking a 25% stake.Chen, Chia-wen, p. 29 Nissan maintained their ownership in Yulon until at least 2003 when a restructuring created Yulon-Nissan Motor Co Ltd, a separate company that focuses on complementing Nissan's mainland China activities with research, design, and manufacturing assistance. the exterior of a face-lift Yulon Feeling  Brands  Yulon has marketed cars under two in-house brands: Luxgen (released in 2009) and Tobe (released in 2010). Luxgen The first Taiwanese auto brand, Luxgen (), was created by Yulon in 2008. On 18 August 2009, Yulon revealed the first car for its new Luxgen brand. Luxgen cars are developed under Yulon's R&D; center HAITEC, using engines and transmissions provided by other companies. As of 2010, Luxgen products are sold in Taiwan and Oman. Tobe Tobe M'car EV Yulon's second brand, Tobe (), was established in 2009. As of 2010, it sells its sole product, a re-badged, re-designed Geely Panda called the Tobe M‚ÄôCar, in Taiwan and Vietnam. Plans to enter other emerging markets exist. However, poor sales and the brand image of being a rebadged Geely led to the end of the brand in 2013. Production bases Yulon has a number of production bases in several countries, including China, Pakistan, Philippines until 2013, Taiwan and probably Thailand. China Initial production base investment in China for Yulon was buying 5% ownership in a Southern China production base in the 1990s. 2000 saw another, larger Chinese production base investment this time of 25%. The latter acquisition was probably in Fengsheng Motors, a Dongfeng Motors subsidiary. As of 2003, Yulon had 25% ownership in the subsidiary yielding access to production bases in Huadu District, Guangzhou, Guangdong and Xiangfan, Hubei. Philippines In 1999 Yulon bought a 75% ownership of Nissan's newly built production base in Santa Rosa, Laguna state.Increasing Globalization and AFTA in 2003: What are the Prospects for the Philippine Automotive Industry?. Rafaelita A.M. Aldaba. Philippine Institute for Development Studies. Page 35, \\"Nissan: Worriedly Awaiting the Signal from Japan\\". This occurred after the Nissan Motor Company pulled out of the Philippines after the Asian market crises caused poor sales in the country. In 2013, it was announced that Nissan Motor Company of Japan will be again taking over Nissan in the Philippines. This comes after dismal sales and poor model updates from Yulon Taiwan, which ranked Nissan Philippines well below local rivals from Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai‚Äînot reflective of its ranking as no. 6 global carmaker.http://oica.net/wp-content/uploads/ranking.pdf  Joint ventures  All of Yulon's joint ventures in Mainland China are with Dongfeng Motor. Dongfeng Yulon A joint venture with Chinese automaker Dongfeng, called Dongfeng Yulon (or Dongfeng Luxgen), was set up in 2009 and will manufacture Yulon's Luxgen models in China after the completion of a planned production base in Hangzhou in 2011. The cars will be sold in China. In July 8th of 2019 Luxgen signed MoU with Mongolian company AGT Auto to build its first car assembly factory in Mongolia.

Shioda and his friend were cornered by the gang. In the ensuing fight, Shioda broke the leg of one of the gang members, the arm of another, and stopped another by punching him in the stomach, all using his aikido skills. Shioda later described this incident as his 'aikido enlightenment' and wrote that one could only truly appreciate what aikido was about once one had used it in a life-or-death situation. Shioda returned to Japan in 1946 and spent several months trying to locate his family on Kyushu. He rejoined Ueshiba for a month of intensive training, but was forced to dedicate the next few years to earning a living in post-war Japan. He began teaching aikido in 1950. That year, he taught for the company Nihon Kokan at the Asano Shipyards in Yokohama. In 1954, he entered the All Japan Kobudo demonstration, and won the prize for the most outstanding demonstration.

The two groups simply evolved independently while maintaining more or less cordial ties.\\" In an interview with Andy Adams for Black Belt magazine, Shioda said, \\"I don't really feel that I broke away from the mainstream of aikido since there was nothing to break away from back then.

In 1973, Shioda sent Takashi Kushida, one of his most senior students, to introduce Yoshinkan aikido to the United States of America. Later life In 1983, Shioda received the 'Hanshi' rank from the Kokusai Budoin-International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF), followed by the rank of 10th dan from IMAF in 1985. In 1990, together with his son Yasuhisa Shioda, he established the International Yoshinkan Aikido Federation.

Q42:23 Verse of affectionQ42:51 Revelation in Islam In Islamic tradition, Quran 42:51 serves as the basis of understanding for Revelation in Islam (wa·∏•y). :\\"It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by the sending of a messenger to reveal, with Allah's permission, what Allah wills\\".Abdullah Yusuf Ali translation Based on this, Islamic scholars have described three ways in which God's revelation can reach His chosen individuals, especially prophets.Muhammad Shafi Usmani, Maariful Quran, see commentary on 42:51 *An inspired message ‚Äì not a word but an idea ‚Äì can enter the heart of the chosen individuals either in the state of consciousness or in dream. *The second mode, it is said, is the word heard by the person spoken to, like, from behind a veil. *In the third mode, the revelation is sent from God through archangels like Gabriel and is delivered to the prophets. It is the highest form of revelation, and Muslims believe the whole Quran was revealed in this mode.

The present day BP Canada was created after a long history of joint ventures, mergers, spin-offs, and the amalgamation of a number of companies - which include the 1982 divestment of its downstream assets to Petro-Canada, and the 1992 demerger of its upstream division into Talisman Energy Inc. , following the divestment of its natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses, current BP operations in Canada focus on oil sands, including joint ventures with companies including Husky Energy and Devon Energy. It has activities in Alberta, the Northwest Territories, and offshore in Nova Scotia and the Canadian Beaufort Sea, and as of 2012 employed more than 450 employees. History The present day BP Canada was created over the years from merging and spinning-off of a number of companies. The predecessor companies of BP Canada include; * Supertest Petroleum Corporation (Main predecessor) ** Triad Oil Company * Amoco (Main predecessor) ** Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company ** Dome Petroleum ** Crestar Energy ** CANMAR ** Syncrude ** Honolulu Oils Heritage through Supertest Petroleum (1923-1992) Supertest station in Toronto, ca. 1965 One major predecessor of the company traces to the Supertest Petroleum Corporation, founded in 1923 and headquartered in London, Ontario. In 1953, British Petroleum Company (BP) entered the Canadian market through the purchase of a minority stake in Calgary-based Triad Oil Company. In the early 1950s, the power struggle between oil companies and host governments in Middle East started, which hampered operations of British Petroleum in the region, and prompted it to diversify its operations beyond the heavily Middle East dependent oil production. The Canadian holding company of British Petroleum was renamed BP Canada in 1969; and in 1971, it acquired 97.8% stake of Supertest. Subsequently, Supertest was renamed to BP Canada Ltd, and other Canadian interests of British Petroleum amalgamated to the new company. BP gas station in Toronto, ca. 1979 BP retail operations disappeared from Canada in the early 1980s, when in 1982, BP Canada divested its downstream assets to Petro-Canada, which was at the time owned by the Government of Canada. In 1992, British Petroleum sold off its 57% stake in BP Canada Ltd to the public, and BP Canada demerged into Talisman Energy Inc. Heritage through Amoco (1926-present) Through the 1998 acquisition of the global operations of Amoco (formerly Standard Oil of Indiana) by British Petroleum, BP Canada acquired the assets of former major Canadian oil and gas companies, including Dome Petroleum and Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company. The heritage traces back through a history of joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions to the year 1926, when the oldest commercial corporation in North America, Hudson's Bay Company, co-founded Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company (HBOG) with Marland Oil Company. Later, Marland oil merged with Conoco in 1929. HBOG expanded during the 1940s and 50s, and in 1960 began shipping Canadian crude to a refinery in Billings, Montana through a new link to the Glacier pipeline. The company became the sixth-largest Canadian producer in 1967. In 1973, HBOG acquired 35% stake in Siebens Oil and Gas, but by 1979 it divested its interest. In 1980, HBOG bought a controlling interest in Roxy Petroleum. In the 1980s, sales and oil prices slipped, while debt from acquisitions piled up which led Hudson's Bay Company to sell off its 52.9% stake in HBOG to Dome Petroleum. However, as a result of the 1986 drop in world oil prices and substantial debts from past takeovers, Dome Petroleum became an acquisition target. In November 1987, after months of negotiation, an agreement in principle was reached with Amoco Canada Petroleum Co Ltd for buying Dome for US$5.5 billion. The purchase was completed on 1 September 1988. In 1998‚Äì2000, the operations of Amoco, ARCO and Burmah Castrol were amalgamated. Into the 2000s, BP Canada operated primarily as a producer of natural gas and employed more than 2000 employees. The company partnered with Imperial Oil beginning in 2010, to carry out exploration of two of its offshore oil and gas blocks in the Beaufort Sea. During 2010 and 2011, BP Canada sold its natural gas operations as part of divestments following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It sold its natural gas business in Alberta and British Columbia to Apache Corporation in July 2010 and its Canadian natural gas liquids business to a subsidiary of Plains All American Pipeline in December 2011. Operations The company operates primarily in Alberta, the Northwest Territories, and Nova Scotia. , BP Canada has approximately 450 employees. It purchases crude oil for the company's refineries in the US, has oil sands holdings in Alberta and four offshore blocks in the Beaufort Sea and Nova Scotia. The company's oil sands leases include joint ventures with Husky Energy in the Sunrise Energy Project (50%), and Devon Energy in Pike, and a partnership with Value Creation Inc. in the development of the Terre de Grace oil sands lease. The Sunrise oil sands project entered the development phase in 2012. , the Pike project, was in the regulatory approval phase, and the Terre de Grace project was in the resource appraisal phase.

It contains 89 verses (ayat). Overview Ornaments of Gold, or Surat Az-Zukhruf, is the 43rd surah of the Quran containing a total of 89 verses. Named after the golden ornaments recognized in verse 35 and again in verse 53, this surah dates back to the Second Meccan Period before the Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs migration to Medina. According to the N√∂ldeke Chronology of surahs, the Ornaments of Gold was the 61st surah revealed.Robinson, Neal. Discovering the Qur'an: A Contemporary Approach to a Veiled Text. London: SCM Press LTD, 1996. Print. 77. The Standard Egyptian chronology, however, acknowledges this as the 63rd surah revealed.Robinson, Neal. Discovering the Qur'an: A Contemporary Approach to a Veiled Text. London: SCM Press LTD, 1996. Print. 73. Regardless of the exact position in which this surah was revealed, it is clear that the surah was revealed during the Second Meccan Period, a time in which Muhammad and his followers were increasingly subject to opposition from the Quraysh tribe. Consistent with all of the surahs of the Quran, Ornaments of Gold begins with the Bismillah, or the standard verse ‚ÄòIn the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy.‚ÄôHaleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 316. Ornaments of Gold is a surah that acts as a reminder to believers that the goodness of God cannot be found within wealth and material power. The surah rejects the claim of disbelievers that prophets, leaders and worthy figures should be marked by their riches and thereby empowers them to refrain from temptations, indulgences and distractions. The surah warns disbelievers who succumb to the ‚Äúmere enjoyments of this life‚Äù (43:17)Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 316. of a terrible and tormented afterlife and it encourages believers to relish not in riches but in their faith and love of God. The surah also repeatedly addresses the fact that the angels are not God's daughters but his faithful servants (43:19).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 317. The possibility of Jesus being the literal son of God is also rejected within the surah (43:63-64).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 319. Themes=Affirmation of the revelation The surah begins with a strong affirmation of the revelation. Verses 2-4 emphasize the Scripture as being ‚Äúclear‚Äù and ‚Äútruly exalted and authoritative.‚ÄùHaleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 316. These verses present a pronounced declaration of the truth and certainty of the revelation and also include the first of the two times that the word \\"Quran\\" is specifically used throughout the surah. The word ‚Äòqur‚Äôan‚Äô is only used 70 times throughout the entirety of the Quran. Quran is a verbal noun in Arabic meaning ‚Äòto recite.‚Äô As it appears in verse 3 and 31 of this surah, it is confirming the Quran as an oral revelation, the spoken word of God recited to Muhammad. The word 'quran' instead of, for example, the word ‚Äòkitab‚Äô (book), reveals not a written but a recited, spoken and oral nature of the Quran.Neuwirth, Angelika. \\"Structural, Linguistic and Literary Features.\\" The Cambridge Companion to the Qur ºƒÅn. By Jane Dammen. McAuliffe. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 2006. 108. Exaltation of God and divinity of the Quran The Ornaments of Gold ends with a flourish of praise and exaltations of God. ‚ÄúHe who is God in heaven and God on Earth; He is the All Wise, the All Knowing‚Äù (43:84).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 320. This creates a parallel between the first and third sections of the surah as it also exalts God as ‚Äúthe Almighty, the All Knowing‚Äù (43:9),Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 316. but also as it praises the words and knowledge of God as the ultimate truth. Debate between the believers and disbelievers The surah continues with a debate between the believers and the disbelievers. These debates, or ‚Äúpolemical utterances‚Ä¶ against listeners who do not comply with the behavioral norms of the cult,‚Äù are an essential element in the structure of the surahs of the Quran.Neuwirth, Angelika. \\"Structural, Linguistic and Literary Features.\\" The Cambridge Companion to the Qur ºƒÅn. By Jane Dammen. McAuliffe. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 2006. 108. In verses 5-19 there occurs a debate between the believers and the disbelievers in which the disbelievers are reprimanded for mocking the revelations and the prophets that have generously been sent down to them by God.Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 316-317 These words are directed at the ungrateful and pretentious disbelievers, referred to as ‚Äòinsolent people‚Äô (43:5).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 316. Afterlife The afterlife, the resurrection of the dead, and Judgement Day are topics of great importance throughout the Qur'an, and they received memorable treatment, particularly in the early Meccan surahs.\\" Ernst, Carl W. (2011). How to Read the Qur'an: A New Guide, with Select Translations. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. 83. In the Ornaments of Gold, verses 57 through 89 declare the imminent Judgment Day. ‚ÄúThis Quran is knowledge for the Hour: do not doubt it, Follow Me for this is the right path‚Äù (43:61).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 319. This section tells of an afterlife for the believers that is full ‚Äúdishes and goblets of gold‚Äù (43:71),Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 319. joy and a garden of bountiful fruit to eat (43:73).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 319. It affirms that believers and their spouses will ‚Äúenter Paradise‚Äù (43:70).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 319. Disbelievers, on the other hand, ‚Äúwill suffer the torment of a grievous day‚Äù (43:65).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 319. This section can be identified as an eschatological prophecy, a common pattern throughout the surahs of the Quran, including The Ornaments of Gold, that ‚Äújuxtapose[s] the situation of the believers in the garden of paradise with that of the disbelievers or evildoers suffering in the tribulations of the fire of hell.\\"Neuwirth, Angelika. \\"Structural, Linguistic and Literary Features.\\" The Cambridge Companion to the Qur ºƒÅn. By Jane Dammen. McAuliffe. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 2006. 104. Angels as daughters Another main theme addressed throughout this surah is the role of the angels as God's servants and not God's daughters. Verses 15-19 discuss the ungrateful disbelievers who consider the angels to be more than just servants of God. \\"The Meccan pagans considered the angels to be daughters of God, yet they were dismissive of their own daughters.Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 316. As verses 15-19 reject any familial ties between God and the angels. The theme of the angels as Gods servants arises again in verses 57-60. Here, the surah once again rejects the pagans who worship the angels as daughters of God and see them as superior to Jesus, whom they believed to be the Christian‚Äôs Son of God.Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 318. The angels are merely servants of God and the surah denounces the disbelievers who argue otherwise just to challenge believers.This has been taken up in a critical vein by Andreas Dorschel, Die Verstocktheit der Ungl√§ubigen. In: Merkur 71 (2017), no. 2, pp. 85‚Äì92. Vorschau Textual notes=Jesus as the Word of God Verse 60 reads ‚Äúif it had been Our will, We could have made you angels, succeeding one another one earth.‚ÄùHaleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 319. This once again affirms angels are God's mere servants, subject completely to his command, but it also evokes another important theme- God as the creator. This verse suggests that God has the power to make angels. He has the power to create a human servant who has just a mother and no father, just as Jesus had. It implies that Jesus is not the Son of God but was the creation of the one, true God. Verses 63-64 additionally discuss the prophet Jesus, denouncing the divinity he is given as the son of God and emphasizing him as a special servant who was born by the miraculous word of God. ‚ÄúWhen Jesus came with clear signs he said, ‚ÄòI have brought you wisdom; I have come to clear up some of your differences for you. Be mindful of God and obey me: God is my Lord and your Lord. Serve Him: this is the straight path‚Äô‚Äù (43:63-64).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 319. These verses reveal that while Jesus was a favored Prophet, he does not possess but is only the messenger of the eternal wisdom of God. He is not the Son of God, nor is he God himself. God is his Lord and the only one that should be served and venerated is Him. Source of Scripture This relates back to the beginning of the surah where the Quran is identified as the ‚ÄúSource of Scripture‚Äù (43:4)Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 316. which can also literally be translated into ‚Äòmother of the Scripture. ‚Äô The Haleem translation of the Qur'an includes that this phrase is also referring to the ‚ÄòPreserved Tablet‚Äô that is referenced in surah 13:39Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 156. and 85:22Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 416. as well. This subtle reinterpretation suggests that the Qur'an is the ‚Äòmother‚Äô of and therefore superior to all of the books revelation. It suggests that the Quran is more reliable and possesses more truth than the Torah and the Gospels and it suggests that the Quran should be revered above all revelations that came before it. One interpretation is that this represents a pronounced declaration of the truth and certainty of the revelation and implies that the Quran is not to be worshipped as divine only orally, but also as it is ascribed on the tablets or written on the pages of the Quran. This interpretation suggests that the Quran is a heavenly book, not a human book. The way it was written is to be revered as the true word of God. Another interpretation of this verse is that the Quran is a unique phenomenon in human history that exists beyond the mundane sphere as the eternal and immutable word of God. Through this interpretation, the Quran is considered an earthly book whose history is intimately linked human life and the history of humanity.Ayoub, Mahmoud M., Afra Jalabi, Vincent J.

The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 416. and is believed to transcend time and space.Ayoub, Mahmoud M., Afra Jalabi, Vincent J. Cornell, Abdullah Saeed, Mustansir Mir and Bruce Fudge. \\"Qur øƒÅn.\\" In The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World. Oxford Islamic Studies Online. 30-Oct-2013. . You and Your Spouses While many Quranic chapters of the Early Meccan periods make references to wide-eyed maidens upon arrival into Paradise, surah 43 explicitly states, \\"Enter Paradise, you and your spouses: you will be filled with joy\\" (Q43:70).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 319.Robinson, Neal. Discovering the Qur ºan: A Contemporary Approach to a Veiled Text. Washington, D.C.: Georgetown UP, 2003. 88-89. The inclusion of verse 43:70 indicates that this surah was revealed in the later Meccan period at which point there existed an emphasis on family. At the time of this surah's revelation, there was less of a concern convincing Meccan pagans to convert and more of a concern developing a law-abiding community centered upon worshipping God's will.Robinson, Neal. Discovering the Qur ºan: A Contemporary Approach to a Veiled Text. Washington, D.C.: Georgetown UP, 2003. 88-89. The Most Merciful The divine names Allah and Ar-rahman ('the Most-merciful) occur eight times throughout this surah. Patterns show that these names were absent from the earliest revelations and were introduced and most prominently used during the Second Meccan period. After the Second Meccan period, Ar-rahman was subsequently dropped and the term Allah was used with increasing frequency. This pattern emerges because in the earliest of revelations, God was referred to as Muhammad's Lord (Arabic Rabb). The names Allah and Ar-rahman were introduced when Muhammad began to preach publicly, but the names were both problematic as many pagans of the time believed not only in God but in lesser deities such as the three goddesses whom they regarded as his daughters (43:15-19).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 316-317. Furthermore, belief in Allah during this time period was not accompanied by any moral demands and it was therefore difficult to convince the pagans that Allah was the only God and that they must obey His command.Robinson, Neal. Discovering the Qur'an: A Contemporary Approach to a Veiled Text. London: SCM Press LTD, 1996. Print. 90-92. Additionally, inscriptional evidence has been verified there were monotheists in Palmyra and the Yemen who regarded God as ar-Rahmn but there is no evidence that the name was known in Mecca.Robinson, Neal. Discovering the Qur'an: A Contemporary Approach to a Veiled Text. London: SCM Press LTD, 1996. Print. 92. Biblical references=Abraham Verses 20-80 of this surah introduce Abraham by way of a narrative of salvation history- a narrative that presents ‚Äúexcerpts of messages from the ‚Äòbook‚Äô which, in turn, is clearly understood to be a corpus of literature apart from the rest of the known stories currently available through known tradition.\\"Neuwirth, Angelika. \\"Structural, Linguistic and Literary Features.\\" The Cambridge Companion to the Qur ºƒÅn. By Jane Dammen. McAuliffe. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 2006. 106. Narratives of salvation history can be clearly identified by their distinct linguistic styles, new messages of imminent catastrophe, and their unique structure, which reflects that of a monotheistic liturgical service centered around the reading of the scriptures.Neuwirth, Angelika. \\"Structural, Linguistic and Literary Features.\\" The Cambridge Companion to the Qur ºƒÅn. By Jane Dammen. McAuliffe. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 2006. 106. This salvation history introduces Abraham as having rejected the way his father and his people worshipped and embraced the truth of God. Those who rejected the message of God were consumed with ‚Äúgolden ornaments‚Ä¶ mere enjoyments of this life‚Äù (43:35).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 317. The disbelievers of the narrative pose the question, ‚Äúwhy was this Qur‚Äôan not sent down to a powerful [wealthy] man, from either of the two cities?‚Äù (43:31).Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 317. The surah continues to affirm that God preferred to deliver His message to those who He taught Himself and who believed in Him, not to those who had material wealth. If wealth and power were of real value and the true reward, God would not have bestowed them upon the disbelievers and hypocrites. This narrative of salvation history also speaks of the rewards and punishments earned by the believers and disbelievers that God reserves for them in the ‚Äúnext life‚Äù (43:35),Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 317-318. referring to the Hereafter or the Judgment Day. Moses Another narrative of salvation history is marked by lines 46-80 which introduce Moses as a messenger and servant of God bearing no ‚Äúgold bracelets‚Äù (43:53)Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 318. and possessing no verifiable power and who attempts to enlighten the Pharaoh and the Kingdom of Egypt to the right path to God. Neither the people nor the Pharaoh were persuaded by a poor and powerless Moses and as they rejected God, they were punished and drowned and made into a lesson for following disbelievers. This narrative of salvation history reveals that worldly gains are not proof of a righteous or unrighteous life and that wealth is more often blinding and harmful than it is helpful. The narrative suggests that these riches are bestowed upon humanity as a test for which they will ultimately be questioned for come Judgment Day. This is structured very similarly to a lesson as one would hear in a monotheistic liturgical service and additionally addresses the coming of the Hour (43:63),Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Qur'an (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 319. or the Judgment Day.

You came to order people to keep good relation with kith and kin and your nation is being destroyed, so invoke Allah I ? So the Prophet I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: 'Then watch you For the day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible.'

So the people complained of the excessive rain. The Prophet said, 'O Allah! (Let it rain) around us and not on us.' So the clouds dispersed over his head and it rained over the surroundings.\\"Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 17: Invoking Allah for Rain (Istisqaa) Volume 2, Number 133http://www.islamicity.com/mosque/sunnah/bukhari/017.sbt.html#002.017.133 * Narrated Masruq ibn al-Ajda': We came upon 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud and he said \\"O people! If somebody knows something, he can say it, but if he does not know it, he should say, \\"Allah knows better,' for it is a sign of having knowledge to say about something which one does not know, 'Allah knows better.' Allah said to His Prophet: 'Say (O Muhammad ! ) No wage do I ask of You for this (Quran) nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).' (38.86) Now I will tell you about Ad-Dukhan (the smoke), Allah's Apostle invited the Quraish to embrace Islam, but they delayed their response. So he said, \\"O Allah! Help me against them by sending on them seven years of famine similar to the seven years of famine of Joseph.\\" So the famine year overtook them and everything was destroyed till they ate dead animals and skins. People started imagining to see smoke between them and the sky because of severe hunger. Allah said:'Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. . . This is painful torment.'

Remove the punishment from us really we are believers.\\" How can there be an (effectual) reminder for them when an Apostle, explaining things clearly, has already come to them? Then they had turned away from him and said: 'One taught (by a human being), a madman?' 'We shall indeed remove punishment for a while, but truly, you will revert (to disbelief).'

It was there that he formulated and expanded his theories concerning both kata based training methods and a particular form of free-style fighting which would put him at odds with much, but not all, of the aikido world. It was this action on the part of Tomiki of attempting to convert aikido into a sport that led to a schism with the founder Morihei Ueshiba and the Aikikai. Tomiki was urged by the Aikikai to adopt a different name for his art other than ‚Äúaikido‚Äù if he intended to introduce such a system of competition. Convinced of the need to modernize aikido, he stood his ground and persisted in his efforts to evolve a viable form of competition. In 1953, Tomiki along with 9 other martial art instructors were selected to tour US Air Force bases in the United States and was thus the first aikido instructor to visit the US. Tomiki is perhaps best known in the judo world for his influence in the developing of Kodokan Goshin Jutsu kata. His work Judo, published in 1956, is considered a classic. The aikido appendix to the book is thought to be the earliest English language text on aikido.Judo Appendix: Aikido, amazon.com In 1967, Tomiki opened his Shodokan Dojo which he used as a testing ground for his theories on aikido and competition. Tomiki followed Ueshiba as the Aikido division head of the Kokusai Budoin-International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF Japan). In 1970, Tomiki retired from Waseda University and, in the same year, presided over the first All-Japan Student Aikido Tournament. The basic rules for the holding of aikido tournaments had been worked out by this time in what would become an ongoing experiment to develop a viable form of competitive aikido.Aikido Tradition and the Competitive Edge p34-35, amazon.com In 1974, he founded the Japan Aikido Association (JAA) from an earlier organization of the same name to promote his theories. Tomiki set up a new dojo for the Shodokan in Osaka on March 28, 1976 with the support of Masaharu Uchiyama, Vice-Chairman of the J.A.A. This dojo was intended to function as the headquarters of the Japan Aikido Association and Tomiki served as its first director. The current head of the dojo and chief instructor of the Shodokan Aikido Federation is Tetsuro Nariyama. Professor Tomiki died on December 24, 1979 leaving his closest disciple, Hideo Ohba as head of the Japan Aikido Association (JAA).

The Kneeling George Sale translation (, al-jƒÅthiyah, aka \\"Crouching\\") is the 45th chapter (surah) of the Qur'an with 37 verses (ayat). It is a Meccan chapter, revealed according to the Islamic tradition during the Meccan phase of Muhammad's prophethood. This is one of the seven chapters in the Qur'an that start with the Muqatta øat HƒÅ º Mƒ´m. It contains discussions of \\"signs of God\\" for humankind to reflect on, and describes punishments for those who deny God despite the signs. It also contains the only Quranic verse mentioning sharia, a term which Muslims later use to refer to the Islamic law. Revelation history According to the Islamic tradition, Al-Jathiya is a Meccan sura, that is, a chapter revealed during the Meccan phase of Muhammad's prophethood. Some Islamic scholars, however, believed that the verse 14‚Äîunlike the rest of the chapter‚Äîwere revealed during the Medinan phase. The Quranic commentator Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 1200) believes the chapter was revealed immediately after the revelation of Al-Dukhan. The traditional Egyptian chronology puts the chapter's revelation order as after al-Dukhan (al-Jathiya at 65th while al- Dukhan is at 64th). The N√∂ldeke Chronology (by the orientalist Theodor N√∂ldeke) puts it as the 72nd, not after al-Dukhan but after the chapter Fussilat.  Content  The chapter starts with the Muqatta øat HƒÅ º Mƒ´m, the sixth of seven Quranic chapters to do so. The following verses (2‚Äì15) discuss the \\"signs of God\\", such as the order in nature as well as its ability to serve humanity. The verses exhort mankind to reflect upon those signs and warn them of the punishment for those who turn away from God despite the signs. Verse 16 talks about the Children of Israel, whom it says were sent with the Book (Torah) and multiple prophets, and were \\"favored above the world\\". The following verse, however, criticized the Jews of Medina for rejecting the message of Muhammad. Verse 18 is the only verse in the Quran that explicitly mentions the term sharia. A partial translation of the verse reads: \\"We have ordained for you a sharia to live in line with\\". Linguistically, the Arabic term sharia means \\"a straight, smooth path that leads to water\\", which in the context of Arabian desert culture could also mean \\"a path to salvation from death\\". This term later became a technical term for the Islamic law, but according to scholar of Islam Bassam Tibi, this term was initially understood as referring to a morality, not law. The remaining verses (20‚Äì37) contain Quranic descriptions of the Judgment Day and the fate of those who deny the signs of God, i.e. the nonbelievers. Verse 28 describes that \\"every community will be upon its knees\\" on Judgment Day, a passage which gives the chapter its name.  Names  The name al-Jathiya (\\"The Kneeling\\") comes from a phrase in verse 28 which says that \\"every community will be upon its knees\\" on the Judgement Day. It is also called al-Dahr (\\"Time\\") after the word's presence in verse 24. Another name is al-Shariah, because the chapter is the only one in the Quran explicitly mentioning the term \\"sharia\\".

This is the seventh and last chapter starting with the letters ha-mim. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it is one of the late Meccan chapters, except for verse 10 and possibly a few others which Muslims believe were revealed in Medina. The chapter covers various topics: It warns against those who reject the Quran, and reassures those who believe; it instructs Muslims to be virtuous towards their parents; it tells of the Prophet Hud and the punishment that befell his people, and it advises Muhammad to be patient in delivering his message of Islam. A passage in chapter 15, which talks about a child's gestation and weaning, became the basis by which some Islamic jurists determined that the minimum threshold of fetal viability in Islamic law would be about 25 weeks. The name of the chapter comes from verse 21, where Hud is said to have warned his people \\"by the sand dunes\\" (bƒ´ al-Ahqaf).  Revelation history According to the Islamic tradition, Al- Ahqaf is one of the late Meccan chapters, chapters which were largely revealed before Muhammad's hijrah (migration) to Medina in 622 CE. Most Quranic commentators say that the tenth verse was revealed during the Medinan period‚Äîthe period after Muhammad's Hijrah. There are minority opinions that say verse 15 and verse 35 were also revealed during the Medinan period. Another minority opinion argues that the entire chapter was revealed in the Meccan period. The traditional Egyptian chronology places the chapter as 66th in order of revelation; in the chronology of orientalist Theodor N√∂ldeke it is 88th. An academic commentary of the Quran, The Study Quran, based on a range of traditional commentators, dates the chapter's revelation to two years before the hijra, around the same time as the revelation of Chapter 72 Al- Jinn.  Content  Mamluk era (14th-15th centuries) manuscript The chapter begins with a Muqatta øat, the two-letter formula HƒÅ-Mƒ´m, the last of the seven chapters to do so. In the Islamic tradition, the meanings of such formulae at the beginnings of chapters are considered to be \\"known only to God\\". The following verses (2‚Äì9) warn against those who reject the Quran and reiterate the Quranic assertion that the verses of the Quran are revealed from God and were not composed by humans. The verses maintain that the Quran itself is a \\"clear proof\\" of God's signs, and challenge the disbelievers to produce another scripture, or \\"some vestige of knowledge\\", to justify their rejection. Verse ten describes a \\"witness from the Children of Israel\\" who accepted the revelation. Most Quranic commentators believe that this verse‚Äîunlike most of the chapter‚Äîwas revealed in Medina and the witness refers to Abdullah ibn Salam, a prominent Jew of Medina who converted to Islam, and whom Muhammad was reported to have described as one of the \\"People of Paradise\\". A minority‚Äîwho believe that this verse was revealed in Mecca‚Äìsay that the witness is Moses who accepted the Torah. Verses 13 and 14 talks about the believers who \\"stand firm\\", to whom \\"no fear shall come ... nor shall they grieve\\". The exegete Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (1149‚Äì1209) says that this means that the believers will not have to fear punishment or many other trials on the Day of Judgement. The believers are described as \\"those who say 'Our Lord is God'\\", without specific references to Islam, possibly meaning that this includes the adherents of all Abrahamic religions. This is related to verse 59 of Al-Ma'ida which says that \\"those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians‚Äîwhosoever believes in God and the Last Day and works righteousness\\" will be rewarded by God, and on them \\"no fear shall come ... nor shall they grieve\\". Verses 15 to 17 instruct Muslims to be virtuous (ihsan) towards their parents and do not disobey them. A passage in verse 15 notes that a mother works hard for a period of \\"thirty months\\", bearing and nursing her child; the explicit mention of \\"thirty months\\" has implications for the calculation of the fetal viability threshold in Islamic law (see #Fetal viability below). Verses 21 to 25 contain the story of the Islamic prophet Hud, who was sent to the people of  øƒÄd \\"by the sand dunes\\" (Arabic: fi al-Ahqaf, hence the name of the chapter). The people rejected his message and were then punished by a storm that destroyed them. The next verses warn the polytheists of Quraysh‚Äîwho opposed Muhammad's message of Islam‚Äîthat they could also be destroyed just as the people of  øƒÄd had been destroyed. The last verse (35) is addressed to Muhammad and instructs him to be patient in the face of rejections of his message, just as the previous prophets of Islam were patient.  Etymology  Ar Rub' Al-Khali (The Empty Quarter), Hadhramaut, Yemen The name al-Ahqaf, translated as \\"the sand dunes\\" or \\"the winding sand tracks\\", is taken from verse 21 of the chapter, which mentions \\"the brother of  øƒÄd\\" (a nickname for the ancient Arabian prophet Hud), who \\"warned his people by the sand dunes\\". According to the 15th-16th century Quranic commentary Tafsir al-Jalalayn, \\"Valley of Ahqaf\\" was the name of the valley, located today in Yemen, where Hud and his people lived.  Fetal viability  Verse 15 of the chapter talks about the period of gestation and breastfeeding, saying that \\"His mother bears him with hardship and she brings him forth with hardship, and the bearing of him, and the weaning of him is thirty months ...\\". Another verse in the Quran, Chapter 2, Verse 233 speaks of mothers nursing their children for two full years. Some Islamic jurists interpret the six-month time difference between the durations found in these two verses as being the threshold of fetal viability in Islamic law. Based on this reasoning, Saudi Arabia's Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta issued a fatwa (legal opinion) in 2008, saying that resuscitation of premature newborns was only required for infants of at least 6 lunar months (25 weeks and 2 days) gestation. In the cases of infants born before this period, the fatwa allowed two \\"specialist physicians\\" to study the conditions and decide whether to provide resuscitation or to leave the child to die. According to a group of Saudi pediatric practitioners, in a paper published in Current Pediatric Reviews in 2013, this opinion reduces the legal consequences for the deciding physicians, up to the 25th week of gestation, and accordingly Saudi hospitals are less aggressive at resuscitating premature infants below this threshold.

An improperly installed windscreen panel separated from its frame, causing the plane's captain to be blown partially out of the aircraft. With the captain pinned against the window frame for twenty minutes, the first officer landed at Southampton Airport.  Aircraft and crew  The County of South Glamorgan was a BAC One- Eleven Series 528FL jet airliner, registered as The aircraft first flew on February 8, 1971, and was delivered to Bavaria Fluggesellschaft on February 26, 1971. It was later transferred to Bavaria Germanair in 1977, Hapag-Lloyd Flug in 1979, British Caledonian in 1981, and finally to British Airways in 1988. The captain was 42-year-old Timothy (Tim) Lancaster, who had logged 11,050 flight hours, including 1,075 hours on the BAC One-eleven; the copilot was 39-year-old Alastair Atchison, with 7,500 flight hours, with 1,100 of them on the BAC One-eleven. The aircraft also carried four cabin crew and 81 passengers.  Incident  Atchison handled a routine take-off at 08:20 local time (07:20 UTC) then handed control to Lancaster as the plane continued to climb. Both pilots released their shoulder harnesses and Lancaster loosened his lap belt. At 08:33 (07:33 UTC) the plane had climbed through about over Didcot, Oxfordshire, and the cabin crew were preparing for meal service. Flight attendant Nigel Ogden was entering the cockpit when there was a loud bang and the cabin quickly filled with condensation. The left windscreen panel, on Lancaster's side of the flight deck, had separated from the forward fuselage; Lancaster was propelled out of his seat by the rushing air from the decompression and forced head first out of the flight deck. His knees were caught on the flight controls and his upper torso remained outside the aircraft, exposed to extreme wind and cold. The autopilot had disengaged, causing the plane to descend rapidly. The flight deck door was blown inward onto the control console, blocking the throttle control (causing the aircraft to gain speed as it descended) and papers and debris blew into the flight deck from the passenger cabin. Ogden rushed to grab Lancaster's belt, while the other two flight attendants secured loose objects, reassured passengers, and instructed them to adopt brace positions in anticipation of an emergency landing. The plane was not equipped with oxygen for everyone on board, so Atchison began a rapid emergency descent to reach an altitude with sufficient air pressure. He then re-engaged the autopilot and broadcast a distress call, but he was unable to hear the response from air traffic control because of wind noise; the difficulty in establishing two-way communication led to a delay in initiation of emergency procedures. Ogden, still holding on to Lancaster, was by now developing frostbite and exhaustion, so chief steward John Heward and flight attendant Simon Rogers took over the task of holding on to the captain. By this time Lancaster had shifted several inches further outside and his head was repeatedly striking the side of the fuselage. The crew believed him to be dead, but Atchison told the others to continue holding onto him, out of fear that letting go of him might cause him to strike the left wing, engine, or horizontal stabiliser, potentially damaging it. Eventually, Atchison was able to hear the clearance from air traffic control to make an emergency landing at Southampton Airport. The flight attendants managed to free Lancaster's ankles from the flight controls while still keeping hold of him. At 08:55 local time (07:55 UTC), the aircraft landed at Southampton and the passengers disembarked using boarding steps. Lancaster survived with frostbite, bruising, shock, and fractures to his right arm, left thumb and right wrist. Ogden dislocated his shoulder and had frostbite on his face, with damage to one eye. There were no other major injuries.  Investigation  Police found the windscreen panel and many of the 90 bolts securing it near Cholsey, Oxfordshire. Investigators found that when the windscreen was installed 27 hours before the flight, 84 of the bolts used were too small in diameter (British Standards A211-8C vs A211-8D, which are #8-32 vs #10-32 by the Unified Thread Standard) and the remaining six were A211-7D, which is the correct diameter but too short (0.7 inch vs. 0.8 inch). The previous windscreen had also been fitted using incorrect bolts, which were replaced by the shift maintenance manager on a like-for-like basis without reference to maintenance documentation, as the plane was due to depart shortly. The undersized bolts were unable to withstand the air pressure difference between the cabin and the outside atmosphere during flight. (The windscreen was not of the \\"plug\\" typefitted from the inside so that cabin pressure helps to hold it in placebut of the type fitted from the outside so that cabin pressure tends to dislodge it.) Investigators found that the shift maintenance manager responsible for installing the incorrect bolts had failed to follow British Airways policies. They recommended that the CAA recognise the need for aircraft engineering personnel to wear corrective glasses if prescribed. They also faulted the policies themselves, which should have required testing or verification by another individual for this critical task. Finally, they found the local Birmingham Airport management responsible for not directly monitoring the shift maintenance manager's working practices.  Awards  First Officer Alastair Stuart Atchison and cabin crew members Susan Gibbins and Nigel Ogden were awarded the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air; Ogden's name was erroneously missed from the published supplement. Atchison was awarded a 1992 Polaris Award for his ability and heroism.  Aftermath  The aircraft was repaired and returned to service, eventually being sold to Jaro International in 1993. It continued to operate with them until Jaro ceased operations in 2001, the aircraft going on to be scrapped the same year. Tim Lancaster returned to work after less than five months. He retired from British Airways in 2003 and flew with EasyJet until he retired from commercial piloting in 2008. Alastair Atchison retired from British Airways shortly after the incident and joined Jet2.com and remained flying until he made his last commercial flight on a Boeing 737-33A (registration: G-CELE) from Alicante to Manchester on June 28, 2015 on his 65th birthday.

It mentions this victory, then criticizes the attitudes of the hypocrites, continues with further promises to the Muslims, and ends by mentioning certain important virtues of the Muslim community. The chapter gets its name from the opening verse, which states \\"Indeed, We have granted you a clear triumph...\\" in direct reference to the Treaty which was signed through cooperation between the opposing forces and without bloodshed. The reason this treaty, and therefore chapter, is called a \\"clear triumph\\" is largely believed to be because of its peaceful nature.

ReferencesExternal links Fath Jihad Hajj ","title":"Al-Fath"},{"id":"1347225","text":"Al-·∏§ujurƒÅt (, \\"The Chambers\\") is the 49th chapter (surah) of the Qur'an with 18 verses (ƒÅyƒÅt). The chapter contains etiquette and norms to be observed in the Muslim community, including the proper conduct towards the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, an injunction against acting on news without verification, a call for peace and reconciliation, as well injunctions against defamation, suspicion, and backbiting. The chapter also declares a universal brotherhood among Muslims. The thirteenth verse, one of the most famous in the Quran, is understood by Muslim scholars to establish equality with regards to race and origin; only God can determine one's nobility based on his piety. The chapter is a Medinan sura, revealed in the year 9 AH (630 CE) when the nascent Islamic state under the leadership of Muhammad had extended to most of Arabia. Muslim historians linked some of the verses (either verses 2‚Äì5 or just 4‚Äì5) to the conduct of a Banu Tamim delegation to Muhammad in Medina. The chapter reprimands the delegates' behavior and then lays down protocol when interacting with Muhammad. Revelation history According to most scholars of the Islamic tradition, the chapter was revealed in late Medinan period, therefore, it is a Medinan sura. It is most likely revealed in 630 CE (or 9 AH), after the Conquest of Mecca and when Muhammad already ruled most of Arabia. A minority opinion, including that of the exegete Mahmud al-Alusi, says that the thirteenth verse was revealed in the Meccan period. The traditional Egyptian chronology puts the chapter as the 106th chapter by the order of revelation (after Al-Mujadila), while the N√∂ldeke Chronology (by the orientalist Theodor N√∂ldeke) puts it as the 112th. Muslim historians, such as Al-Waqidi and Ibn Ishaq, linked the revelation of several verses to the conduct of a delegation from the Banu Tamim when they were in Medina to meet with Muhammad. According to Al-Waqidi, the Tamimites were negotiating the release of Tamimite prisoners in Muhammad's custody, while according to Ibn Ishaq they were challenging Muhammad to a mufakhara (a boasting contest, a pre-Islamic Arabian practice). As Muhammad was sleeping, they went through the private apartments of Muhammad and his wives to seek him out. Verses 2‚Äì4 (according to Al-Waqidi) or verse 4 (Ibn Ishaq) of this chapter describe the Tamimites' behavior, while verse 5 reprimands it and instructs Muslims to be patient when seeking audience with Muhammad. Al-Waqidi dated this event as month of Muharram 9 AH, while Ibn Ishaq's account implied that it had happened in Ramadan 9 AH or later. Content In general, the chapter addresses the growing Muslim community and establishes norms to be observed within it.  Proper conduct towards Muhammad  Verses 1 to 5 focus on the etiquette towards Muhammad, including lowering one's tone in his presence and respecting the privacy of his chambers.  Unity and brotherhood within the Muslim community  The following verses (6‚Äî12) emphasise the ties of brotherhood within the Muslim community (ummah) and establish social principles to maintain its unity. Verses 6 to 8 call on Muslims to not act on news before verifying its authenticity. The following two verses encourage promoting peace and reconciling quarreling parties within the community. The tenth verse is known as the verse of brotherhood and instructs Muslims to unite in a universal brotherhood. The next verse, verse 11, warns the members of the community against defamation, mocking and name-calling. Verse 12 calls for Muslims to avoid suspicion (zann, also translated \\"conjecture\\"), spying on others to find faults (tajassus), and backbiting (ghibah). The Quran considers backbiting‚Äîslandering someone in their absence‚Äîso sinful and abhorrent that it is compared to \\"eating the flesh of [one's] brother\\".  Equality of mankind  Verse 13 is one of the most famous verses of the Quran: > O mankind, surely We have created you from a male and a female, and made you > tribes and families that you may know each other. Surely the noblest of you > with Allah is the most dutiful of you. Surely Allah is Knowing, Aware.The > Quran 49:13, Maulana Muhammad Ali translation Commentators of the Quran, including Abul A'la Maududi and Sayyid Qutb, argued that this verse declares the equality of mankind. Mankind is spread around the world and has different nations and tribes to know each other, and no one is superior based on color, race, or origin. According to the verse, only taqwa (piety, fear of God) makes one nobler before God. According to the commentary of The Study Quran, this verse marked a reform of the moral order in Arabia, where previously one's worth had been determined by \\"lineage and grandiose displays of valor and generosity\\" and where fear of God had been seen as the opposite of nobility, to one which focused on \\"the depth of faith and piety.\\"  Nature of faith  The remaining verses (14 to 18) contain clarifications on the Quranic view of faith. Verse 14 indicates degrees of faith: Islam (submission) and the higher iman (belief). According to verse 15, a true believer believes in God and Muhammad without doubt, and proves it through devotion and the spending of one's wealth in the way of God. The chapter closes by saying that only God knows the real extent of one's faith. Name The chapter is named after the word Al-Hujurat (The Private Apartments) which appeared in the fourth verse. Verses 4 and 5 instructed the Muslims to not enter the private apartments of Muhammad‚Äîat this point the ruler of most of Arabia‚Äîor his wives to search for or petition him.

Career Aged nine, Hikitsuchi he began kendo, and then later kenjutsu, jujutsu, bojutsu and karate. Hikitsuchi trained extensively in J≈´kend≈ç (bayonet) as a young man, and was skilled in both iaido and kendo. When he was 14, he met Morihei Ueshiba. At that time there was an age requirement for studying budo with Uesiba, but they made an exception for Hikitsuchi. Hikitsuchi recounts a midnight, lights-out training with Ueshiba, in which he cut off the tip of Ueshiba's bokken. The piece flew off, and he searched throughout the dojo for it. Eventually, Ueshiba pulled it out of the folds of his kimono, praising him highly for his skill.Perry, Susan. Remembering O-Sensei. Shambala Publications, Inc., 2002, p.39 Months later, Ueshiba gave Hikitsuchi a scroll inscribed with \\"Bojutsu Masakatsu Agatsu\\" (True Victory is Self-Victory). The scroll was extensively illustrated by a famous artist, and contained Ueshiba's written explanations of techniques. Meik Skoss, who has seen the scroll, wrote, \\"One of the phrases on the scroll is very interesting, 'each of these pictures is the seed for a hundred techniques; study them well.'\\" According to Clint George, one of Hikitsuchi‚Äôs former students who trained in Shingu for 15 years, \\"Shingu bojutsu\\" consisted of four levels: * Ikkyo ‚Äî a fundamental solo form * Nikyo ‚Äî a solo form that explored circular movement * Sankyo ‚Äî a solo form that explored three-dimensional, spherical movement * Yonkyo ‚Äî Jiyuwaza ‚Äî free, un-choreographed movement Michio Hikitsuchi received his 10th dan in 1969, three months before Ueshiba's death. Hikitsuchi taught as chief instructor of Kumano Juku Dojo in Shingu, Japan until his death in 2004. The dojo was founded by Ueshiba in 1953. Hikitsuchi traveled twice to the United States, and regularly to European countries, teaching at dojos that had been started by his students. American Aikido instructors who trained extensively under Hikitsuchi and the other senior instructors at Shingu include Mary Heiny (Seattle), Linda Holiday (Aikido of Santa Cruz), Jack Wada (Aikido of San Jose), Laurin Herr (San Francisco), Tom Read (Northcoast Aikido), John Smartt (New School Aikido), and Daniel Caslin (Aikido of Owensboro). His student Clint George is no longer teaching.) Hikitsuchi was described by other teachers in Shingu as an \\"Aiki computer\\" because of his ability to recite virtually verbatim the speeches Ueshiba had given. He also had extensive knowledge of Shinto Norito (chanting) and the spiritual teachings of the Kojiki‚Äîareas of personal emphasis by his teacher, the founder of aikido. He passed this experiential knowledge of the Shinto Norito to Sensei Jack Wada, who demonstrates it regularly and passes it on to good students. Hikitsuchi's reverence for Ueshiba and his message was total.

Chiba; February 5, 1940 ‚Äì June 5, 2015) was a Japanese Aikido teacher and founder of Birankai International. He served for seven years as uchideshi at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo before being dispatched abroad to help develop Aikido internationally. He held an 8th dan in Aikido, issued by Aikikai world headquarters in Tokyo, Japan and was active in Aikido for over 50 years. Biography=Early life Kazuo Chiba was born February 5, 1940 near Tokyo, Japan. At 14 years of age, he began serious Judo training at the International Judo Academy, and also began the study of Shotokan karate at age 16. In 1958, after coming across a photo of Morihei Ueshiba in a book, he decided to dedicate himself solely to Aikido and set out to apply as an uchideshi at the main school in Tokyo. Though not accepting live-in students at the time, after much persistence Chiba was admitted as an uchideshi at the Hombu dojo in Tokyo. Most of the daily training at the Hombu dojo was conducted by Kisshomaru Ueshiba, the son of the Aikido founder; O'Sensei was frequently away from the dojo giving lectures on Aikido and Oomoto-Kyo during Chiba's stay as uchideshi. For much of his seven-year period as a live-in student, however, Chiba Sensei traveled extensively with Morihei Ueshiba as his personal assistant during travels spreading Aikido. By 1960, Chiba had received the rank of 3rd dan and was assigned to Nagoya to establish one of the first branch schools of the Aikikai headquarters, where he served as its full-time instructor. In 1962, he also began teaching at the Hombu Dojo, and within three years had completed his training as uchideshi and earned promotion to 5th Dan. United Kingdom During the 1964 Olympic Games held in Tokyo, a notable Judo master, Kenshiro Abbe came to Hombu Dojo to pay respects to O'Sensei. It was during this visit that he requested an instructor be dispatched to England to develop Aikido for the British Judo council. Chiba Sensei, who had been serving tea to the two masters had been supposed to go to New York to assist Yamada Sensei, but on the request O'Sensei sent him as the first representative of the Aikikai Foundation in the UK, though other teachers had gone in previously. In March 1966 he bag his voyage from the Port of Sasebo and arrived in the UK at Heathrow Airport on the 5th May 1966. In 1970 he was promoted to 6th Dan and awarded the title Shihan, Master Instructor. In 1975, Chiba returned to Japan to serve as Secretary of the International Department at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. During the ten years Chiba spent in the UK, he also helped to promote Aikido across Europe particularly in Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Morocco, Spain and Switzerland. = Northumberland = Chiba Sensei faced much racism in the post-war culture of Britain since the Japanese had been on the opposing side e.g., on arrival his luggage was turned out and he was taken to a separate room to be questioned about the purposes of his visit. He told the immigration officers that he was there to teach martial arts (which he subsequently thought was an unwise thing to do) and showed them the contract from the British Judo Council (BJC). As a result, a representative of Mr Logan, who had been with Kenshiro Abbe during the visit to Hombu Dojo and who was Chiba Sensei's sponsor, was brought in to represent the BJC and to account for Chiba Sensei's visit and after several hours he was released. After leaving the airport they went to King's Cross Station and boarded a train for Newcastle. Mr Logan intended to establish Chiba Sensei in Newcastle with mats which had been shipped on the same boat that bore him to England. Chiba Sensei spoke limited English when he arrived in the UK. It was more than a month after arrival that Mr Logan informed him that he intended to bring home a Japanese interpreter, Mr Kimura, who spoke fluent English and worked for the company affiliated with Common Brothers Shipping - the company of which Mr Logan was an executive. This helped mediate what had become a long and lonely period in the UK, but it did not resolve many of the problems which were to occur later. The encounter with English life was at first difficult for Chiba Sensei. The British climate was in stark contrast to his home, in particular the lack of sun caused him sleeping difficulties and Mrs Logan would wake him at 08:00 with a cup of English tea which he did not enjoy at the time, though later in life he became a great fan of Builder's tea he commented that 'I could not stop dreaming of soy sauce.' Moreover, the tradition of high tea with guests speaking 'ceaselessly' to each-other was a profound culture shock. In early June 1966, one month after arrival, Chiba Sensei was told by Mr Logan that they had arranged for him to do a demonstration at the Northumberland Police Headquarters in Newcastle, the intention being that the Police may hire him to teach a self-defense program. The event took place at a Judo dojo near the Police Headquarters, with a dozen policemen dressed in keikogi and two high-ranking officers sat in chairs observing. The two conditions of the police were that no striking or kicking, and no bloodshed were to take place due to the police's policy against inflicting injury. For the first half hour Chiba Sensei responded to requests for defense against various attacks. Towards the end of the demonstration Chiba Sensei was asked to respond to handgun threats, one position was in the surrender pose with his hands in the air and the gun behind his head. Chiba Sensei performed shihonage and the uke landed on his head which began to bleed covering the keikogi and he was carried out by his comrades after becoming unconscious. Chiba Sensei knew that the mission had therefore been unsuccessful and he never heard from the police force subsequently. The situation for Chiba Sensei became steadily more difficult, and a couple of weeks after the demonstration he had a long conversation with Mr Logan with the aid of Mr Kimura. During this meeting it became clear to him that there was a dire political situation preventing him from teaching Aikido in the UK,and hence the unexpected break since arriving. There were two Judo organisations in the UK: the British Judo Council (BJC) and the British Judo Association (BJA). The former was founded by Kenshiro Abbe, but the latter was recognized by the British authorities and was a member of the International Judo Federation (IJF) which was a member of the Olympic Committee that only recognizes one organisation per field, per country. The situation mirrored the history in Japan since Abbe Sensei had come from the Butotukai in Kyoto, rival to the Kodokan in Tokyo. Nonetheless the BJC had a stronger membership (20,000 - 30,000) than the BJA, the failure after ten years to get his students recognized had caused Abbe Sensei political isolation leading to sickness which motivated his move back to Japan in 1964. However, for Hombu Dojo (then under the direction of Kisshomaru Ueshiba) Abbe Sensei was the official representative of British Aikido and therefore on his request for a teacher from the Aikido Foundation to head the Aikido portion of his organisation, the British Aikido Council (BAC), there had been no reason to question the situation. Apart from the political situation inherited from the Judo world, Chiba Sensei was faced with further problems from the AIkido world. In particular the BAC was headed by Ken Williams who did not know Chiba Sensei. Moreover, the BAC had Nakazono Sensei who was living in Paris, France as a technical advisory upon the request of Kenshiro Abbe. This relationship was not known of by Hombu Dojo and though Chiba Sensei had met him previously at Hombu Dojo, he had never seen him in the Aikido community and was not aware he was a teacher. Furthermore, Nakazono Sensei was a close friend of Tadashi Abe, who had been uchideshi under O'Sensei before the war and had taught aikido in France, subsequently assisting the BAC on the request of Kenshiro Abbe. It was this role which Nakazono Sensei had inherited. Chiba Sensei had been closely associated with Tadashi Abe Sensei and admired him greatly, he had even co- signed the contract with the BJC. Furthermore, Masamichi Noro, another former uchideshi and direct senior to Chiba Sensei, was also living and teaching in France and assisting Nakazono Sensei and Ken Williams with the BAC. Unfortunately Nakazono Sensei was deeply offended that he had not been consulted by Kenshiro Abbe as the head of the BAC and consequently Nakazono Sensei and Ken Williams decided to pull away from the BAC along with the entire membership to form the Renown Aikido Society. The result was that since the BJC was paying Chiba Sensei a (modest) monthly salary plus all the expenses in bring him to the UK, but was drawing no income from him, as he had been unable to teach since arrival, the organisation was losing money. When Chiba Sensei understood the situation he requested of Mr Logan to meet with Nakazono Sensei and Noro Sensei, which was fortuitous since they had been invited to teach at the annual BJC Summer School in Chigwell. Mr Logan objected since he and Kenshiro Abbe had the intention to build the BAC from the bottom up, without these teachers involvement. In particular Kenshiro Abbe, as well as his Aikido students in the UK, had lost confidence in them due to the formation of the Renown Aikido Society in his absence. In August 1966 Chiba Sensei traveled from Newcastle to London, and Chigwell, by train and had a number of meetings with Nakazono and Noro Sensei over the course of several days. The meeting were largely fruitless as the two Japanese teachers insisted that the only resolution was for Chiba Sensei to give up his position within the BAC and instead join the Renown Aikido Society. Chiba Sensei refused, believing that it would have been a betrayal of Kenshiro Abbe and that it was a subversion of Hombu Dojo's authority in the Aikikai world. Chiba Sensei felt that the behavior of the British aikidoka was a breach of martial ethics, and his appreciation grew for the enormous difficulties Kenshiro Abbe had faced in the UK, magnified by the end of the Pacific War. He had been aware of the issues faced by the Judo politics and the decline in Kenshiro Abbe's health this had affected, but now felt unable to consult him about the present issues as he did not want to burden him further. Chiba Sensei continually felt isolated by both the cultural separation and the growing political one and despite Mr Logan's effort's, their relationship continued to grow cold. As a result, Mr Logan suggested Chiba Sensei invite his wife Mitsuko to the UK. Chiba Sensei refused this offer since he wished to follow the terms of the contract as written, regardless Mr Logan booked her a flight to London for sometime in September 1966. Realizing that he no longer could object, Chiba Sensei felt that despite the problems associated with Mrs Chiba's untimely arrival, her coming might help open up the stagnant situation. As tensions escalated Mr Logan and Chiba Sensei had a destructive argument frustrated by the language barrier and terminated in Chiba Sensei shouting 'Get out of here!' to which Mr Logan quite logically insisted that Chiba Sensei leave his house. Mr Logan procured him an apartment and he moved out, on the first opportunity he wrote to Mrs Chiba telling her that she must not come and should wait for a letter from him. However, he was still poor and unable to teach Aikido and therefore, increasingly restless and with a longing for the city, he decided to go to London where the vice president of the BJC, Mr Otani, put him up in his house in Acton in a room once occupied by Kenshiro Abbe. After returning to his lodgings one afternoon he received a phone-call from Mr Otani informing him that London Heathrow had called to say that Mrs Chiba had arrived. Considering that he had sent a telegram telling her not to come and knowing that Mr Logan had cancelled her flights after their dispute, the news came as a surprise. When he met her at the airport and asked her if she had received the note or had had problems getting on the flight she answered 'no' to both questions. Chiba Sensei was unable to enjoy the event since he knew that in the current situation he could not provide her with a secure and stable living situation. It was not clear what had occurred to bring Mrs Chiba to the UK, and the relationship between Chiba Sensei and Mr Logan strained further as Mr Logan was required to pay for the flights and remained convinced that someone had-acted on Chiba Sensei's behalf to secretly put her on the plane behind his back. Chiba Sensei was offended by the suggestion, but noted that Mr Logan may have known that Mrs Chiba's father Mr Sekiya worked for the Japanese Airlines Office as a testing engineer and his close friend Mr Konami was a JAL representative in the London Office and used this information to form the conspiracy. Within a week of Mrs Chiba's arrival, Mr Logan sent documents to their apartment informing them that his three-year renewable contract with the BJC had been cancelled. Chiba Sensei was not surprised since his relationship with Mr Logan had grown frostier since Chiba Sensei regarded the other Japanese teachers as his seniors and therefore could not compete with them in the way Mr Logan intended, which Chiba Sensei believed was a slight misunderstanding of Kenshiro Abbe's wishes. Chiba Sensei found himself in an even more desperate situation, now he had no wage and a wife to support. So he went to see the man in charge of Sunderland Physical Education, who he had me through Mr Logan. He was a former Aikidoka, and had led a SPE sponsored group that was loosely associated with the Renown Aikido Society. Chiba Sensei inquired if there would be some availability for him to teach Aikido within their programs, he was asked to return in a few days. Upon the second visit to the office Chiba sensei was informed that there were two evening classes per week available at a local school in town. They had already been meeting for some time and were being taught by a senior ranking member (third-first kyu) who was willing to turn the classes over. At the same time he informed Chiba Sensei that they had arranged a room for him in the house of another member, free of charge. In early October 1966, Mrs Chiba and Chiba Sensei moved into the house of the dojo member and his wife, a childless couple in their thirties. Chiba Sensei was deeply touched to be received so open heartedly and with this couple began to appreciate the real English way of life. The classes were held at a local secondary school numbered around twenty students, and were of a mixture of men and women and ages - 'all of whom appeared to be beginners regardless of their rank'. They came from an Aikido section of a dojo in town called Sunderland Martial Arts Academy which taught Aikido, Judo and Karatedo. Sometime later the Sunderland Academy invited Chiba Sensei to teach at their dojo three times a week on a regular basis. It was a small group of about ten, and again seemingly beginners. However, there were a group of young students, 18‚Äì20 years old who were physically fit and eager to learn. The dojo became the center of Chiba Sensei teaching activity in the Northeast of England until 1968. At the same time the SPE gave him a daytime class once a week at the Monkwearmouth Technical College. As a result, after a long period of inactivity since arriving in May 1966, Chiba Sensei was fully engaged in teaching Aikido six days a week and began to report back positively to Hombu Dojo after a long silence. In mid- October 1966 a demonstration sponsored by the local television station was held in the gymnasium of the secondary school where Chiba Sensei was conducting classes. Chiba Sensei used the student who had been leading the classes before his arrival as the uke, unfortunately he landed badly and hit his head hard enough to cause a severe concussion and was taken to hospital, successfully treated for intracranial bleeding, losing some sight in one of his eyes. Another demonstration was arranged a few weeks later by the school principal, who was a member of the evening classes. The exhibition took place at a garden house near the beach and the audience was composed entirely of elderly British ladies. Chiba Sensei took issue with martial arts being used as entertainment at a tea party, but concluded 'Well, this is England, not Japan.' and began the demonstration against his better judgement. Towards the end he demonstrated jodori, and during kotegaeshi the uke lost control of his jo which smashed the cup a lady was drinking from and caused general chaos in the crowd. As a result, there was a public outcry about the uncivilized behavior of the foreigner (Chiba Sensei) who offended the delicate ways of English Society, Not long after the SPE refused to let a promising student, Mr Butler, attend Chiba Sensei's classes on account of misbehavior. Chiba Sensei asked them to reconsider and they had several meetings to discuss the issue, but they maintained their stance and refused to justify their position further than saying the student (who was in his 40s) was a 'bad man'. Chiba Sensei told them he would bring Mr Butler to the classes as his personal teaching assistant and stated that since the classes were open to the public and funded by the taxpayer they were obliged to keep the door open to everyone without personal discrimination. As a response he was informed that he had been fired from teaching classes sponsored by the SPE, and a few days later that he must vacate the house that the SPE had arranged. The move was a blessing in disguise since Chiba Sensei and his wife likely were quite inconvenient for their hosts, and the room they had been generously offered was not suitable. It was cold and damp, and the only way to heat it was to constantly burn coal in the fireplace, the back-draft from which filled the room with smoke. The combination of these effects caused Chiba Sensei to develop a serious lung infection which exacerbated his asthma. Furthermore, in order to treat his illness he needed to soak in a tub of hot water to warm the body, and to ease his breathing with steam. Unfortunately the hot water reserve was limited so Mrs Chiba had to collect hot water from a pan on the stove in the kitchen. Mid-December 1966, a few days before Christmas, Chiba Sensei visited the patron of YMCA hostel to see if there might be a room available for him and his wife. The patron said yes and gave him special permission to have Mrs Chiba with him, which was against their male only policy. When they left their house Chiba Sensei thanked the couple for their generosity over the last three months and presented them with a camera he had bought in Japan as a thank you. The room at the YMCA was much better, having central heating and unlimited hot water. Meals were served every day morning and evening, except Sunday and holidays. Chiba Sensei's asthma soon disappeared. The other residents were college students from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East and Chiba Sensei spent much time with them to improve his English and was inspired by their hopes to participate in the future development of their various countries. On 30 December 1966 Chiba Sensei taught his last class of the year at the Monkwearmouth College, the bus ride was roughly 20 minutes long but he decided to walk so he could buy some bread and a Guinness for him and his wife's first New Year's Eve in England. = London = On the 14 December 1967 Chiba Sensei left Newcastle Station on the 11:55 train bound for London to relocate. Three notable individuals had appeared to see him off: Mr Logan's secretary, Mr Myers of Sunderland, who had acted as his personal assistant during his stay, and his student Mr P Butler. The move represented a certain freedom for Chiba Sensei, since it was an escape from the tangled political situation of Aikido in Britain and the power struggle. As preparation Chiba Sensei had discarded his belongings, save his weapons, a few books, and a heavy sheepskin coat. When he arrived he met with Mr Iyengar and George Stavrou at King's Cross Station who had invited him from the North. Soon after arrival Chiba Sensei started teaching at Busen Dojo in King's Cross, the old Judo dojo where Kenshiro Abbe had started. There were approximately twenty students practicing, most of which were associated with George Stavrou. When the mats Mr Iyengar had ordered arrived the dojo moved to a new location Seven Sisters Road in Finchley, London. The new space was a community hall rented for two nights a week until they were able to find a better and more suitable location in the Greater London Sports Club in Chiswick where they had semi-permanently laid down the tatami mats. In 1972 the dojo relocated once more into a large Church hall in Earl's Court with a better atmosphere for a dojo and remained there until Chiba Sensei left for Japan in 1976. It was during this period that Chiba Sensei began the first kenshusei program that incorporated Aikido, weapons, iaido, and Zazen. Chiba Sensei also formed the Aikikai of Great Britain (AGB) which grew steadily and expanded into several major cities in the UK, namely Birmingham, Leicester, Sunderland, Durham, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff, and Glasgow. In the early 1970s Chiba Sensei had a serious commitment to development of Aikido in Europe through the European Aikido Cultural Association (ACEA), the representative organization recognized by Hombu Dojo in Europe. He managed to reestablish his relationship with Tada Sensei, who was teaching in Italy, and joined his annual International Summer Course held at Lake Grada in Northern Italy near Verona. All activities combined he was traveling somewhere in the UK or the European continent nearly every weekend of the year. in 1975 Kisshomaru Ueshiba conducted a tour of the UK, Spain, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland, Germany, Switzerland, and Monaco. It was while Nidai Doshu was in Madrid that the International Aikido Federation (IAF) was formed, and the first congress of the IAF was scheduled to be held in Tokyo in May 1976. During that interval with strong recommendation from the directing committee of the ACEA Chiba Sensei was nominated to be the first secretary of the International Affairs for Hombu Dojo. Return to Japan In addition to his duties within the Aikikai after returning to Japan, Chiba also began serious study of Mus≈ç Shinden-ry≈´ iaido under Takeshi Mitsuzuka. There was a time he lived in the Ichikukai Dojo where he practiced Zen, Misogi, and received his Zen-Buddhist name Taiwa which stands first in T.K. Chiba. United States Chiba Sensei moved to San Diego, California in 1981 on an invitation from the United States Aikido Federation and formed the San Diego Aikikai. Under Chiba Sensei's direction, San Diego Aikikai served as the headquarters for the Western Region of the United States Aikido Federation (later Birankai North America), an organization directly affiliated and recognized by Aikido World Headquarters (Hombu Dojo)] in Tokyo, Japan. For the next twenty-seven years Chiba continued to work diligently to promote aikido worldwide by teaching numerous seminars and by creating a rigorous teacher training program for his own students. In 2008, after 50 years in Aikido, Chiba retired from active teaching. Aikido Style Chiba Sensei was dedicated to his master, and felt passionately about the Aikido as Budo which he learnt from O'Sensei as uchideshi. After O'Sensei died it became the position of Hombu dojo to keep Aikido accessible to all practitioners, regardless of age or physical limitations which does not contradict the principles of Aikido. However, Chiba Sensei learnt it as a (practical) martial art and rejected vehemently the idea that Aikido should become something else hence he insisted on keeping a live martial element which resulted in stylistic differences from the Aikikai foundation who were moving toward a more generic system. > All the other elements Aikido as \\"an art of living,\\" as a means to better > health, as calisthenics or a physical aesthetic pursuit all of these stem > from a common root, which is budo. That they do so is perfectly fine, but > the point is that they're not the root themselves. O-Sensei always stressed > that \\"Aikido is budo\\" and \\"Budo is Aikido's source of power.\\" If we forget > this then Aikido will mutate into something else a so-called \\"art of living\\" > or something more akin to yoga. -- T. K. Chiba As a result the Aikido practiced by Chiba Sensei and his students has been known as a dynamic or martial version. Having deep respect for the Aikikai Foundation it was important for Chiba Sensei that he and his students always respect their authority in the aikikai world. Therefore unlike other notable students of O'Sensei, Chiba Sensei did not create his own school of Aikido separate from the Aikikai, but rather a style within the community - an important distinction. Unlike Aikido practiced at Hombu Dojo, Chiba Sensei Incorporated weapons work (Bokken and Jo), Zazen, and Iaido into his style.  Weapons  Chiba Sensei learnt the aiki-jo and aiki-ken system of Iwama- Ryu Aikido during his time there with O'Sensei and Saito Sensei, and for many years taught these. However, he subsequently adapted the forms incorporating elements of his study of Iaido and classic Japanese swordsmanship.  Zazen  It is well documented that O'Sensei taught Aikido as an extension of his deep religious views which combined Shinto and Zen. During his time as uchideshi, Chiba Sensei was introduced to both of these elements in particular misogi and zazen, which were both practiced by O'Sensei. However, the system of spiritual discipline he followed was based on Chinkon-Kishin (method of pacifying the soul and regaining or recovering the spirit) derived from ancient Shintoism and its extension - the study of Kototama doctrine (the miraculous power of language inherent within the Japanese alphabet). Other students were also strongly influenced by this in particular the emphasis on ki by Koichi Tohei, and the Ki-no-renma system of Hiroshi Tada (who both influenced Chiba Sensei) stem from this study, all three were also heavily influenced by the breathing-system of Nakamura Tempu and regularly taught elements of it. During his time with the founder, Chiba Sensei learnt that three principles were important for the study of Budo: religious faith, farming, and martial discipline. He confessed himself to having 'no problem with following the practice of farming and martial discipline' and continued both throughout his life, but he 'could not avoid the increasingly strong internal resistance that, as time went on, built up within [him] toward the Founder's spiritual discipline.' In an article he later wrote that he 'suffered from an internal split and feared the loss of unity between the physical art and spiritual discipline which was supposed to be the underlying principle of the art.' It was for this reason that he took up serious zen practice and remained a devoted zen Buddhist in the Rinzai school for the rest of his life, he wrote that this was a positive turning point in his Aikido life. Zen is a discipline bringing about a confrontation with one's own original face and man's fundamental living principle, so-called \\"Honrai-no- Memboku\\" through engaging in the most direct, simple and primordial physical act of sitting. Chiba Sense defined Aikido as a martial art in which one has to deal with one's subjectivity in relation to others, and concluded that zen can be viewed as a premise or precondition for the martial discipline. He would often call Aikido a \\"moving Zen\\". His intention was to carry out a close inquiry concerning the essence of martial discipline by injecting the element of Zen discipline into the Dojo training where the practitioners are forced to confront their own true faces by being driven into a situation where there is no escape. During his return to Japan after the UK, Chiba Sensei underwent a serious inquiry of Iaido and Zazen (and farming) and received the Zen-Buddhist name Taiwa meaning 'demon-eyes'. When established in the United States, Chiba Sensei strongly encouraged his students to also practice zazen, and made it a regular part his own dojo's timetable. Once the network was established, Genjo Marinello of Chobo-Ji was appointed as the meditation instructor for Birankai International and conducted regular sesshin. Since zazen was only introduced after his stay in the UK, many British students did not adopt it, however devotedly following his master Chris Mooney would regularly invite Genjo for sesshin and after years of serious study became Buddhist in the same school as his master, receiving his own Buddhist name of Gyoshin meaning 'mind of eternity'. Many of the later generations of Chiba Sensei's students also made a serious study of zazen and misogi, also receiving zen-buddhist names e.g., among the full-time teachers are Jenny Flower (Greece) who revived the name 'Toko' and Robert Savoca (USA) who received the name 'Ryugan'.  Iai-Batto- Ho  Chiba Sensei got permission to adapt forms of Muso Shiden Ryu Iaido which he studied whilst in japan and taught these forms to his Aikido students as the Ia-Batto-Ho system. Birankai International In an effort to unite all of his students around the world, Chiba Sensei founded Birankai International in January 2000. This multinational organization was founded to strengthen the connections between Chiba Sensei's students worldwide and is recognized by Aikido world headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. It includes organizations in the United Kingdom, France, Austria, Greece, Poland, Canada, United States, Chile and many other places worldwide. Notable disciples who have pursued Aikido on a professional full-time basis include Robert Savoca of Brooklyn Aikikai, George Lyons of Bucks County Aikikai, Jenny Flowers of Athens Aikikai, and Piotr Masztalerz of Wroclaw Aikikai. = Shihankai = Chris Mooney Shihan Certification - Hombu 2006. The Birankai organisations of various countries have been given Hombu Official Recognition in accordance with the rules set forth in the International Regulations of Aikido World Headquarters. In order to keep the traditions of the school and preserve the art, Chiba Sensei created a shihankai of his senior students, all certified by Hombu Dojo, who give technical guidance of the various national organisations. In Europe the official meeting was on 18 January 2006, comprising Noberto Chiesa, Mike Flynn, Chris Mooney, and Gabriel Valibouze, where it was agreed that the role of the shihankai would be to: * act as custodians for the integrity of Chiba Sensei's work for the future in Europe (UK & Continental Europe), * be closely involved with maintaining and developing the high quality of future and existing teachers in Europe, * look to the future and plan for the time after Chiba sensei's retirement in Europe, * take a strategic view of Aikido within Birankai and across the world with Aikikai Hombu Dojo in Japan and other Aikido associations. In particular since Chiba Sensei was in the USA, after the dissolution of Birankai Continental Europe (BCE) and the creation of the national Birankai organisations each country had an internal shihankai composed of the Shihans who lived there, and others were appointed Shihans to oversee the technical development within the organisation. As a result, in Europe the following teachers oversee the technical development within the associated countries: * Patrick Barth√©l√©my - France * Daniel Brunner - Switzerland, Poland * Dee Chen - Britain * Noberto Chiesa - France * Mike Flynn - Britain, Greece, Portugal *Chris Mooney - Britain, Switzerland, Germany, Israel, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan * Gabriel Valibouze - France ReferencesExternal links * Official Birankai International Homepage * 1995 interview with Aikido Journal 1940 births 2015 deaths Japanese aikidoka Shihan ","title":"Kazuo Chiba"},{"id":"1347243","text":"a·π≠-·π¨≈´r (, \\"The Mount\\") is the 52nd chapter of the Quran with 49 ayat.

She was a member of the Angry Penguins movement and the Heide Circle who played an integral role in the development of Australian Modernism. Hester is best known for her bold and expressive ink drawings. Her work was charged with a heightened awareness of mortality due to the death of her father during her childhood, the threat of war, and her personal experience with Hodgkin's Disease. Hester is most well known for the series Face, Sleep, and Love (1948‚Äì49) as well as the later works, The Lovers (1956‚Äì58). Biography= Early life  Hester was born on the 21st of August, 1920 and raised in Elwood to middle-class parents Louise and Robert Hester. Robert died from a heart attack when Hester was twelve. Hester studied art from an early age and was a student at St Michael's Grammar School from 1933 to 1937. At 17, Hester enrolled in Commercial Art at Brighton Technical School for one year before leaving to attend the National Gallery School in Melbourne. Her curriculum was based in traditional media and practice, however Hester took the opportunity to break free from formal restraints. In 1938 Hester won the Gallery School‚Äôs Drawing Head from Life prize. Taking up classes at both the Design school, and Painting and Life school gave her early recognition. Her work during this time, though bound by tradition, was concerned with shadow and tonal shading, the relationships between dark and light. Heide Period In 1938 Hester met fellow artist Albert Tucker and began living with him intermittently in East Melbourne. During the same year Hester became a founding member of the Contemporary Art Society (CAS), exhibiting with them annually. Hester met Melbourne-based art patron Sunday Reed in 1939 at the Herald Exhibition, which brought British and French artworks to Australia for the first time. The two became friends, with Reed nurturing Hester‚Äôs artistic talent. Spending much of her time at Heide with Sunday and her husband John Reed, Hester became a member of the Heide Circle. She was a contemporary of Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd, Charles Blackman, John Perceval, Yosl Bergner and Danila Vassilieff during this period. The Heide Circle worked as an extension of the Angry Penguins magazine. Hester was the only woman to be featured in the Angry Penguins publication. One of her most significant works from this time was Nude Study, (c. 1939-41). It was her first use of bold, fluid black line work, which is what she is known for today. During the early 40s, Hester began depicting the ambience of daily life, via ink drawings of street scenes and factory workers. She was influenced by artist Ailsa O'Connor, who had similar concerns in her work. Hester was also drawn to the work of Vassilieff for his philosophical views about how art and life could not be separated. By the mid 40s, Hester relinquished her interest in oil painting to concentrate solely on watercolor and inks. Her focus shifted towards the motif of the human face, specifically the expression in the eyes. Using minimal and assertive ink strokes, she rendered her figures with emotional intensity. A Frightened Woman (1945) served as a seminal point in establishing Hester‚Äôs style and media moving forward. Hester works aimed to capture the psychological horror of World War II. Hester and Tucker married 1941. Five years later Hester gave birth to a son, Sweeney Reed (1944‚Äì1979). In 1947, when Sweeney was three, Hester was diagnosed with terminal Hodgkin's lymphoma. Believing she had only 2 years to live, she decided to move to Sydney to live with Melbourne artist Gray Smith, and gave her son into the care of John and Sunday Reed, who subsequently adopted him. Illness impacted heavily on Hester's work and left an indelible mark, loading it with emotional content. During this period Hester produced the drawings that became part of her notable Face, Sleep and Love series. These works were exhibited alongside Hester‚Äôs poetry in 1950 at her first solo show at the Melbourne Bookclub Gallery. Later life Hester had two subsequent solo exhibitions in 1955 and 1956 but struggled to sell her art. She typically worked on a small scale in black ink and wash, however, Australian modernism favoured large oil paintings, like those of Nolan. Hester‚Äôs work failed to garner the same recognition her male peers received, dismissed by critics as ‚Äúangst-ridden‚Äù. The Lovers series (1956‚Äì58) were indicative of her maturing and expressive style. She also published poetry and used her drawings to illustrate her words. Joy and Roger had two children a son Peregrine in 1951, and a daughter Fern in 1954. The couple married in 1959. After a period of remission Hester suffered a relapse of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1956 and died on 4 December 1960, aged 40. Hester was laid to rest at the Box Hill Cemetery in an unmarked grave, at her behest. Legacy John and Sunday Reed organised a commemorative exhibition of Hester's work in 1963. In 1978 a street in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm was named Hester Place in her honour. In 1981, Janine Burke, Hester's biographer, curated the first major retrospective at the National Gallery of Victoria. Hester's life and work was the subject of a documentary, The Good Looker, in 1995. A plaque was erected in 1999 at the Box Hill Cemetery in honour of Hester‚Äôs contribution to the arts. Reviewing her work for Time in 2001, Michael Fitzgerald wrote \\"Forty-one years after her death, Hester's drawings still suck the oxygen from the air, providing some of the clearest-eyed images in Australian art\\". In 2018 her Love and The Lovers series of works featured in a joint exhibit with Patricia Piccinini at TarraWarra Museum of Art. Piccinini credited Hester as a major influence on her own practice; stating: \\"I love the way her painting, especially those with merged features, are simultaneously surreal and figurative. I am really interested in depictions of love and intimacy in my own work, so I find Hester's approach very inspiring\\". \\"Patricia Piccinini & Joy Hester: Through Love...\\" by Victoria Lynn, TarraWarra Museum of Art: 2018, , p15  Exhibitions = Solo Exhibitions  * Melbourne Book Club Gallery, 6 February 1950 - 17 February 1950, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. * Mirka Cafe, July - August, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. * Gallery of Contemporary Art, 9 April 1957 - 23 April 1957, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. = Posthumous Solo Exhibitions = * Joy Hester, 3 September 1963 - 21 September 1963, Museum of Modern Art and Design of Australia, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. * Drawings by Joy from a private collection, 2 August 1966 - 12 August 1966, South Yarra Galleries, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. * Joy Hester Graphics, 20 October 1970 - 2 November 1970, Australian Galleries, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. * Joy Hester, 6 October 1976 - 25 October 1976, Tolarno Galleries, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. * Joy Hester, April 1977 - May 1977, Philip Bacon Galleries, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. * Joy Hester, Early Works on Paper, 14 June 1980 - 3 July 1980, Tolarno Galleries, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. * Joy Hester Retrospective, 29 September 1981 - 5 December 1981, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. * Joy Hester, Early Works, 2 March 1982 - 18 March 1982, Tolarno Galleries, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. *Joy Hester: Remember Me, 21 March 2020 - 14 June 2020, Heide Museum of Modern Art, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

It is a Meccan surahQuran Verses in Chronological Orderwhich celebrates the night when the first revelation of what would become the Qur'an was sent down. The chapter has been so designated after the word al-qadr in the first verse. It is mainly about power. Quran 97 describes Laylat al-Qadr, the \\"Night of the abundant portion of blessings\\" in Ramadan on which Muslims believe the Qur'an was first revealed. The night is not comparable to any others in view of Muslims and according to a tradition, the blessings due to the acts of worship during this night cannot be equaled even by worshipping throughout an entire lifetime. The reward of acts of worship done in this one single night is more than the reward of around 83 years (1000 months) of worship. Laylat al-Qadr is referenced in the Quran: :VERILY we sent down the Koran in the night of al Kadr.s :And what shall make thee understand how excellent the night of al Kadr is? :The night of al Kadr is better than a thousand months. :Therein do the angels descend, and the spirit of Gabriel also, by the permission of their LORD, with his decrees concerning every matter.t :It is peace until the rising of the morn.Q97:1-5 George Sale translation The \\"Spirit\\" mentioned in verse 4 is commonly interpreted as referring to the angel Jibreel (Gabriel). The \\"peace\\" referred to is called by Mujahid \\"security in which Shaytan (Iblis) cannot do any evil or any harm\\", while Ibn Kathir quotes Ash-Sha'bi as saying that it refers to the angels greeting the people in the mosques throughout the night. Laylat al-Qadr occurs during an odd-numbered night within the last ten days of Ramadan, but its exact date is uncertain; due to the promises made in the chapter and in various hadith. Muslims consider it a particularly good time for prayer, supplication, and repentance to God. This event marks the descent of the first revelation of the Quran to Earth. The official Islamic teaching is that Muhammad received the revelations that formed the Quran piecemeal for the next twenty-three years of his life up until the time of his death. Shia Muslims believe that Ali (the first Shia Imam, and the fourth caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate to Sunnis) had special insight and intimacy with God on this night.(Tafsir \\"al-Burhan\\", vol. 4, p. 487) Period of revelation Whether it is a Makka or a Madina revelation is disputed.

Academic Publication Council, Kuwait University: Vol. 29, Issue 116. 2011. has made the claim that the majority of scholars regard it as a Madani Surah. Ali bin Ahmad al-Wahidi in his commentary says that this is the first chapter to be sent down in Madinah. Contrary to this, Al-Mawardi says that according to the majority of scholars it is a Makki revelation , and the same view has Imam Suyuti expressed in Al-Itqan. Ibn Mardayah has cited Ibn Abbas, lbn Az Zubair and Aishah as saying that this chapter was revealed at Mecca. Theme and subject matter Its theme is to acquaint man with the value, worth and importance of the Quran. Its being placed just after Quran 96 (al-alaq) in the arrangement of the Quran by itself explains that the Holy Book, the revelation of which began with the first revelation of first five verses of al-alaq was sent down in a destiny making night. It is a glorious Book and its revelation for mankind is full of blessings. At the outset, God says: \\"We have sent it down.\\" That is, it is not a composition of Muhammad himself, but We Ourself have revealed it. Then, it is said that \\"We sent it down in the Night of Destiny.\\" Night of Destiny lies two meanings and both are implied here. First, that it is the night during which destinies are decided; or, in other words, it is not an ordinary night like the other nights, but a night in which destinies are made or destroyed . The revelation of this Book in this night is not merely the revelation of a book but an event which will change the destiny of not only the Quraysh tribe, or of Arabia, but of, the entire world. The same thing has been said in Quran 44 (ad-dukhan) for which please see Introduction to that chapter and E. N. 3 thereof. The other meaning is that this is, a night of unique honor, dignity and glory; so much so that it is better than a thousand months. Thus, the disbelievers of Mecca have been warned, as if to say: \\"You on account of your ignorance regard this Book, which Muhammad (upon whom be God's peace and blessings) has presented, as a calamity for yourselves and complain that a disaster has befallen you, whereas the night in which it was decreed to be sent down was such a blessed night that a task was accomplished in it for the well being of mankind, which had never been accomplished even during a thousand months of history.\\" This also has been said in verse 3 of ad-dukhan in another way, which is explained in the introduction to that chapter. In conclusion, it has been stated that in this night the angels and Gabriel descend with every decree (which in verse 4 of Quran 44 has been described as amr-hakim: wise decree) by the leave of their Lord, and it is all peace from evening till morning; that is, there is no interference of evil in it, for all decrees of God are intended to promote good and not evil. So much so that even if a decision to destroy a nation is taken, it is taken for the sake of ultimate good, not evil.

The Surah is so designated after the word al-bayyinah occurring at the end of the first verse.  Summary  This is the 98th Surat, by no coincidence composed of 98 words, with both structural and thematic symmetries more characteristic of the Meccan period. The central chiasm is precisely positioned in the 5th verse \\"religion [of Abraham], upholding prayers and giving alms, that is true religion\\" this in turn is flanked by concentric looping themes in an A B C  C' B' A' pattern where A' responds to A, B' responds to B and C' responds to C. As an example of this structure, verse 2 stating \\"A Messenger from Allah reciting purified scriptures\\" is answered by verse 7 \\"Indeed, they who have believed and done righteous deeds ‚Äî those are the best of all creatures.\\" The sura opens by addressing the polytheists of Arabia, as well as those amongst the People of the Book who had fallen into disbelief. Allowing that they may be restored only by a \\"clear sign\\" from God who speaks holy and untainted words ‚Äî the Prophet Muhammad bringing the Qur'an, which lays down proper laws and morality. The fifth ayah is pivotal and explains that all God asks of mankind is \\"To praise God by offering Him devotion being true, to pray the Salat, and to give charity. And that is the Religion of Truth.\\" Those who cling to these simple practices of faith in Allah, prayer and charity will be offered the Gardens of Paradise, \\"underneath which rivers flow\\", as their prize; for God is pleased with them for being the best of possible creations. Those who turn away, however, shall meet the fires of Hell. Theme and subject matter Its having been placed after Surahs Al-Alaq and Al-Qadr in the arrangement of the Quran is very meaningful. Surah Al-Alaq contains the very first revelation, while Surah Al-Qadr shows as to when it was revealed, and in this Surah it has been explained why it was necessary to send a Messenger along with this Holy Book. First of all the need of sending a Messenger has been explained, saying: The people of the world, be they from among the followers of the earlier scriptures or from among the idolaters, could not possibly be freed from their state of unbelief, until a Messenger was sent whose appearance by itself should be a clear proof of his apostleship, and he should present the Book of God before the people in its original, pristine form, which should be free from every mixture of falsehood corrupting the earlier Divine Books; and which should comprise sound teachings. Then, about the errors of the followers of the earlier Books it has been said that the cause of their straying into different creeds was not that Allah had not provided any guidance to them, but they strayed only after a clear statement of the Right Creed had come to them. From this it automatically follows that they themselves were responsible for their error and deviation. Now, if even after the coming of the clear statement through this Messenger, they continued to stray, their responsibility would further increase. In this very connection, it has been stated that the Prophets who came from Allah and the, Books sent down by Him, did not enjoin anything but that the way of sincere and true service to Allah be adopted, apart from all other ways, no one else's worship, service or obedience be mixed with His, the Salat be established and the ZakƒÅt be paid. This same has been the true religion since ever. From this also it automatically follows that the followers of the earlier scriptures, straying from this true religion, have added extraneous things to it, which are false, and Allah's this Messenger has come to invite them back to, the same original faith. In conclusion, it has been pointed out clearly that the followers of the earlier Books and the idolaters who would refuse to acknowledge this Messenger are the worst of creatures: their punishment is an everlasting Hell; and the people who would believe and act righteously, and would spend life in the world in awe of God, are the best of creatures: their reward is eternal Paradise wherein they will live for ever. Allah became well pleased with them and they became well pleased with Allah.  References  * Haddad, Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 97, mo. 4. (Oct. ‚Äì Dec. 1977), pp. 519‚Äì530. Bayyina ","title":"Al-Bayyina"},{"id":"1347254","text":"The Earthquake George Sale translation (, al-zalzalah, aka \\"The Quake\\") is the 99th chapter (surah) of the Qur'an, composed of 8 verses (ayat). Though it is usually classified as a Medinan surah, the period under which the surah was revealed is not unanimously agreed upon by Qur'anic exegetes.  Summary  The surah begins by describing how on the Day of Judgment, the Earth will give off a terrible earthquake and \\"throw up her burdens\\". Through the inspiration of God, the Earth will bear witness to the actions of men it has witnessed. According to Michael Sells, the earth opening up and bearing forth her secrets in this sura is indicative of a birth metaphor. The earth al-'Ard in the feminine gender bears forth of how her lord revealed the final secret to her. Human beings will then realize that the moment of accountability has arrived. This meticulous accountability will reflect good and evil deeds that might have seemed insignificant at the time.Sells, Michael, Approaching The Qur'an, p. 108-109, The two concluding verses state that all men will be sorted out into groups according to their deeds, and they will see the consequence of everything they have done; every atom's weight of good or evil: Period of revelation Whether it was revealed at Mecca or Medina is disputed. Ibn Masud, Ata, Jabir, and Mjahid say that it is a Meccan surah, and a statement of Ibn Abbas also supports this view. On the contrary, Qatadah and Muqatil say that it is Medinan, and another statement of Ibn Abbas also has been cited in support of this view. That it is a Medinan surah is reasoned from a tradition from Abu Said Khudri, which Ibn Abi Hatim has related from him. He says: \\"When the verse Fa-man ya mal mithqala dharratin khairan yarah, wa man ya mal mithqala dharratin sharran yarah, was revealed, I said: \\"O Messenger of Allah, shall I really see my deeds? The Holy Messenger replied in the affirmative. I submitted: And every major sin? He replied yes. I said: And the minor sins too? He replied yes. Thereupon I exclaimed that I would then be ruined. The Holy Prophet said: Rejoice, O Abu Sa'id, for each good act will be equal to ten good acts like it.\\" The basis of the argument for this surah's being Madani is that Abu Sa'ld Khudri was an inhabitant of Medina and reached maturity after the Battle of Uhud. Therefore, if this surah was revealed in his presence, as is apparent from his statement, it must be a Medinan surah. However, the practice that the Companions and their immediate successors followed, in respect of the occasion of the revelation of the verses and surahs, has already been explained in the Introduction to Surah Ad-Dahr above. Therefore, a companion's saying that a verse was sent down on this or that particular occasion is no proof that it was sent down on that very occasion. It may well be that after coming of age when Abu Sa'id heard this surah for the first time from Muhammad, terrified by its last portion he might have asked Muhammad the questions which we have cited above, and he might have narrated the incident saying that when this verse was revealed he put this and this question to Muhammad. In the absence of this tradition every reader who reads the Qur'an with understandings will feel that it is a Makki Surah. More than that: from its theme and style he would feel that it must have been sent down in the earliest stage at Makkah when the fundamental principles and beliefs of Islam were being presented before the people in a concise but highly effective way. Theme and subject matter Its theme is the second life after death and presentation in it before man of the full record of the deeds done by him in the world. In the first three sentences it has been told briefly how the second life after death will take place and how confounding it will be for man. In the next two sentences it has been said that this very earth on which man has lived and performed all kinds of deeds thoughtlessly, and about which he never could fancy that this lifeless thing would at some time in the future bear witness to his deeds, will speak out on that Day by Allah's command and will state in respect of each individual person what act he had committed at a particular time and place. Then, it has been said that men on that Day, rising from their graves, will come out in their varied groups from all corners of the earth, to be shown their deeds and works, and their presentation of the deeds will be so complete and detailed that not an atom's weight of any good or evil act will be left unnoticed or hidden from his eyes.  Tafseer  Allah informs us about what will happen on the Day of Rising, ‚ÄúWhen the earth is violently shaken,‚Äù convulsing and rocking ‚Äúwith its (final) quake,‚Äù flattening all buildings and edifices, the mountains crumble and fall and the hills are flattened. The earth‚Äôs surface becomes like a barren, level plain on which you see neither dip nor gradient.[1] ‚ÄúAnd the earth disgorges its burdens,‚Äù the deceased and treasures lying within her ‚Äúand man cries,‚Äù when he sees the terror that has stricken it, exclaiming ‚ÄúWhat is wrong with it?‚Äù what has happened! ‚ÄúOn that Day it‚Äù the earth ‚Äúwill recount its news,‚Äù bearing witness against man for the good and evil he wrought on its surface. The earth is one of the witnesses that will be brought forward on the Day of Rising to testify for or against man., all whats hidden will be exposed! That is ‚Äúbecause your Lord had inspired her,‚Äù ordered her to relate what was done on her surface and she will not disobey His command. ‚ÄúThat day, man will come forward‚Äù to the Standing of the Day of Rising for Allah to judge them ‚Äúin scattered groups‚Äù broken, disparate bands ‚Äúto be shown their deeds,‚Äù that Allah may show them what they worked of good and evil and that He may show them His recompense. ‚ÄúWhoever does an atom‚Äôs weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom‚Äôs weight of evil will see it,‚Äù this holds true for any good and any evil that was worked: if a person will see even an atoms weight and, moreover, be recompensed for it, then for sure he will see anything greater as well. Allah says, ‚ÄúOn the Day that each self finds the good it did, and the evil it did, present there in front of it, it will wish there were an age between it and then. Allah advises you to beware of Him. Allah is Ever-Gentle with His slaves.‚Äù[2] There are other chapters of the Quran describing this Quran 81:1-3, 6-7 \\"When the sun is folded and loses its light and the stars fall; and the mountains disintegrate... and when the seas are ignited; and the souls are rejoined with their bodies.\\" Quran 82:1-4 \\"When the sky cracks; and the planets scatter; and the seas explode; and the graves are overturned\\"  Interpretation of S≈´rat az-Zalzalah  > > In the name of AllƒÅh, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. > 1\\\\. ÿ•Ÿêÿ∞Ÿéÿß ÿ≤ŸèŸÑŸíÿ≤ŸêŸÑŸéÿ™Ÿê ÿßŸÑŸíÿ£Ÿéÿ±Ÿíÿ∂Ÿè ÿ≤ŸêŸÑŸíÿ≤ŸéÿßŸÑŸéŸáŸéÿß > When the earth is shaken with its [final] earthquake > 2\\\\.

These codices never gained general approval and were viewed by Muslims as the personal copies of individuals.

They are typically shorter, with relatively short ayat, and mostly come near the end of the Qur'an's 114 s≈´war. Most of the surahs containing muqatta øat are Meccan.

In accordance with the western exegesis mentioned, the Muslim tafsirs Dr. Israr Ahmed, Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, Nouman Ali Khan & Farhat Hashmi lectures & orations. also exert that the contents of this surah show that this is one of the earliest Surahs to be revealed at Makkah. Placement & Coherence with other surahs The surahs of the Qur'an are not haphazardly compiled as is generally thought. They have been arranged in a specific order by the Almighty, and like the arrangement of the verses within a surah, the arrangement of the surahs within the Qur'an is very apt and meaningful with relation to the topic they discuss. In a nutshell, as per this arrangement, the Qur'an is divided in seven distinct groups and the surahs within each group occur in pairs. This pairing of the surahs is on the basis of the topics discussed, and each member of a pair has a complementary relation with one another. Some surahs are an exception to this scheme like Surah Fatihah, which is like an introduction to the whole Qur'an. Some other surahs have come as an appendix or as a conclusion of a group. The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as nazm and munasabah in non-English literature and coherence, text relations, intertextuality, and unity in English literature. Hamiduddin Farahi, an Islamic scholar of the Indian subcontinent, is known for his work on the concept of nazm, or coherence, in the Quran. Fakhruddin al-Razi (died 1209 CE), Zarkashi (died 1392) and several other classical as well as contemporary Quranic scholars have contributed to the studies. This surah belongs to the last(7th) group of surahs which starts from Surah Al-Mulk (67) and runs till the end of the Quran. The theme of the seventh group is to warn the leadership of the Quraysh of the consequences of the Hereafter, to communicate the truth to them to the extent that they are left with no excuse to deny it, and, as a result, to warn them of a severe punishment, and to give glad tidings to Muhammad of the dominance of his religion in the Arabian peninsula. Briefly, this can be stated as delivering warning and glad tidings. Rhetorically Al-Qariah has 2 similarities with Al- Haaqqa(69). Firstly the opening of the surah resembles Al-Haaqqa(69) which opens with the wordings 69:1 ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéÿßŸÇŸéŸëÿ©Ÿè 69:2 ŸÖŸéÿß ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéÿßŸÇŸéŸëÿ©Ÿè 69:3 ŸàŸéŸÖŸéÿß ÿ£ŸéÿØŸíÿ±ŸéÿßŸÉŸé ŸÖŸéÿß ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéÿßŸÇŸéŸëÿ©Ÿè notice that Al-Qaria opens in exactly same style 101:1 ÿßŸÑŸíŸÇŸéÿßÿ±ŸêÿπŸéÿ©Ÿè 101:2 ŸÖŸéÿß ÿßŸÑŸíŸÇŸéÿßÿ±ŸêÿπŸéÿ©Ÿè 101:3 ŸàŸéŸÖŸéÿß ÿ£ŸéÿØŸíÿ±ŸéÿßŸÉŸé ŸÖŸéÿß ÿßŸÑŸíŸÇŸéÿßÿ±ŸêÿπŸéÿ©Ÿè Secondly, word Al-Qaria appears as a total of 5 times in Quran and out of which thrice it is mentioned in this surah while once it appears in Al-Haaqqa as well. Connection with adjacent surahs Al-Qariah form a pair with next surah At-Takathur in regards to their subject-matter. The first surah warns its addressees of the situation that will arise on the Day of Judgement, while the second, with reference to this situation warns them of their attitude of indifference -Javed Ahmed Ghamdi.Javed Ahmed Ghamdi - Tadabbur-i-Quran Regarding its message, this surah forms a group of four similar surahs along with two previous and one next surah which depicts judgement day with picturesque description and concludes the topic of every person's deeds being weighed and thus resulting in either heaven or hell allotted to the according person. -Dr.Israr Ahmed.Dr.Israr Ahmed - Bayan-ul-Quran  Theme and Subject Matter  The theme of this surah is resurrection and the hereafter; a scene explaining the day of judgement. At the outset, the people have been aroused and alarmed, saying: \\"The Great Disaster! What is the Great Disaster? And what do you know what the Great Disaster is?\\" Thus, after preparing the listeners for the news of the dreadful calamity, Resurrection has been depicted before them in two sentences, saying that on that Day people will be running about in confusion and bewilderment just like so many scattered moths around a light, and the mountains uprooted, will their cohesion and will fly about like carded wool. Then, it has been said that when God's Court is established in the Hereafter and the people are called upon to account for their deeds. The people whose good deeds are found to be heavier than their evil deeds, will be blessed with bliss and happiness, and the people whose good deeds are found to be lighter than their evil deeds, will be cast into the deep pit full of burning fire. Sale divides the contents of the surah in three principal subjects Ayat 1-5: The day of judgment a day of striking. Ayat 6-9: The good and bad shall be judged according to their works. Ayat 10,11: H√°w√≠yah described.

Criminal career In September 1985, Hogue, now 25 years old, stole the identity of a deceased infant and enrolled as a student at Palo Alto High School as Jay Mitchell Huntsman, a 16-year-old orphan from Nevada. On October 7, 1985, Hogue entered the Stanford Invitational Cross Country Meet. Hogue ran far ahead of the field and won the race, but did not report to the officials' table, arousing suspicion. Jason Cole, a reporter covering the event for the now-defunct Peninsula Times-Tribune, uncovered Hogue's identity theft, and Hogue left town. In 1987, Hogue applied to Princeton University, using the alias Alexi Indris-Santana, a self-taught orphan from Utah, where he was then living. Hogue's application materials claimed that he had lived outdoors in the Grand Canyon, raising sheep and reading philosophy books. Princeton invited Hogue to attend in the fall of 1988, but he deferred admission for one year, telling Princeton his mother was dying. In reality, Hogue had pled guilty to possessing stolen bicycle equipment, and had been sentenced to five years in prison. Hogue served nine months before being paroled from Utah State Prison in March 1989. Having also received a financial aid award from Princeton, he immediately left for the college, in violation of the terms of his parole. For the next two years, he lived as Santana, was a member of the track team, and was admitted into the Ivy Club, one of Princeton's most exclusive eating clubs. His real identity was exposed when Renee Pacheco, a former classmate from his days as \\"Jay Huntsman\\" at Palo Alto High School, recognized him. She contacted reporter Jason Cole, who exposed Hogue a second time. On February 26, 1991, Hogue was arrested in class and charged with forgery, theft, and falsifying records. In October 1992, Hogue pled guilty to third-degree theft for taking more than $22,000 in scholarship money and was sentenced to nine months in jail. Hogue served 134 days in jail. At some point in 1992, Hogue was briefly employed by the Harvard Mineralogical Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a part-time cataloguer. At the time, Hogue was taking a course in mineralogy at the Harvard Extension School. In April 1993, the museum discovered that gems, mineral specimens, microscopes, and other items worth $50,000 had gone missing, and suspected Hogue as the result of a tip. On May 10, 1993, police arrested Hogue in Somerville, Massachusetts and charged him with grand larceny. On May 26, 1993, Harvard police returned to Hogue's Somerville apartment and recovered $600 in electronic equipment reported stolen from a New Jersey electronics firm where Hogue worked in the summer of 1992. In June 1993, Hogue was charged with two counts of larceny and one count of receiving stolen property by the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office. Hogue's theft was one of the largest in the history of the Harvard University Police Department. Hogue violated the conditions of his parole by returning to Princeton and hanging around the campus using the name Jim MacAuthor; he had not officially enrolled, but had attended social functions and eaten in the cafeteria. After a graduate student recognized him, he was arrested on February 19, 1996, and taken into custody by the Princeton Borough Police ‚Äì who later released him on his own recognizance. He was later incarcerated in the Mercer County Correctional Center on a conviction for defiant trespass. Hogue was released from prison in 1997 and vanished from the public eye. In 1999, Jesse Moss, a director making a documentary film about Hogue, tracked him down in Aspen, Colorado and secured his cooperation. The completed documentary, entitled Con Man, was released in 2003. During this period, Hogue was arrested at least twice for theft. In January, 2005, police with a warrant searched Hogue's home in San Miguel County, Colorado, finding 7,000 items, worth over $100,000, stolen from nearby homes where Hogue had worked as a remodeller and repairman. The stolen goods \\"packed his house and a small secret compartment he'd built.\\" He was apprehended in Tucson, Arizona on February 4, 2006 by Deputy United States Marshal Richard J. Tracy Jr.Fugitive \\"Con Man\\" from Colorado Nabbed in Tucson, United States Marshals Service, February 4, 2006 Suspect in thefts near Telluride has led life of cons, Aspen Times News, February 8, 2006. and deputies from the Pima County, Arizona Sheriff's department while Hogue was sitting in a Barnes & Noble cafe, surfing the internet. On March 12, 2007, Hogue pleaded guilty to theft, in return for limiting his sentence and dropping additional charges.Hogue pleads guilty to felony theft charge, Denver Post, March 13, 2007. He was released on probation in 2012. On November 3, 2016, Hogue was arrested in Aspen on a misdemeanor theft warrant from Boulder County, Colorado. Aspen police discovered Hogue living in an illegally constructed, camouflaged shack on Aspen Mountain, and possibly in the midst of building a second illegal structure on the mountain. Hogue gave a false name when apprehended and may be charged with criminal impersonation. ReferencesLiterature * Samuels, David.

London: Royal Philatelic Society, pp. 126-127. A Sperati forgery of an 1856 stamp of Saxony. Giovanni (Jean) de Sperati (14 October 1884Lowe & Walkse, 2001, p. 119. ‚Äì 28 April 1957Lowe & Walkse, 2001, p. vii.) was an Italian stamp forger. Robson Lowe considered him an artist and even professional stamp authenticators of his time attested to the genuineness of his work. Sperati created what he called a Livre d'Or which he boasted of in his autobiography and which contained 239 favourable opinions as to the genuineness of his forgeries from numerous experts, including Dr. Edward Diena and the Royal Philatelic Society London.Lowe & Walkse, 2001, p. 122. Early life Sperati was born 1884 in Pistoia,Lowe & Walkse, 2001, p. 119. Italy, though he spent a large part of his life in France where he adopted the name Jean. Sperati retained his Italian passport throughout his life and always considered himself an Italian.Lowe & Walkse, 2001, p. 131. As a child in Pistoia and later in France, Sperati began to collect stamps. He was particularly interested in printing techniques, as well as photography which was in its infancy at that time. Relatives owned a postcard factory as well as a paper mill. Through this, Jean de Sperati was able to obtain copious knowledge of photographic processes, print technology and chemicals. These formed the basis for his eventual career as a stamp counterfeiter. The first forgeries  An undated work of Jean de Sperati. Probably a proof. The first attempts to copy stamps went extraordinarily well. The first forgeries were of valuable stamps from San Marino, and stamp experts believed them to be real. Thereupon Sperati began to produce numerous further reproductions of valuable stamps from all over the world. This eventually resulted in well over 500 master-quality forgeries from more than 100 different stamp-issuing agencies. In 1942, for the first time in his life, Sperati came into conflict with the law. A shipment marked as valuable from Sperati to a stamp dealer in Lisbon, Portugal was intercepted by French customs. It contained several falsified German stamps. They charged him with \\"exporting capital\\" without a licence and trying to avoid customs payments. He protested his innocence, and explained to the police that it contained only copies of valuable stamps, which he himself had prepared, whereupon the police called in the country's best stamp experts to clear up the facts of the case. These experts came to the judgment that the stamps in question were all originals, and very valuable ones at that. Sperati still managed to convince the police that they were fakes, and was therefore charged with fraud. His trial took place in April 1948. The 1948 trial To explain, Jean de Sperati tried to convince the court that he had no deceitful intentions in the sale of the stamps. He considered himself to be an artist and not a counterfeiter. Furthermore, he declared to the court that he had merely forgotten to clearly mark the stamps as forgeries and he promised to be more diligent about such marking in the future. He claimed that he had offered the forgeries of rare stamps at about 1% of the normal market price in order to assist the simple collector to obtain these rarities. Nevertheless, the Parisian judiciary convicted Jean de Sperati and sentenced him to a year in prison, 10,000 francs fine and an additional 300,000 francs for criminal intentions. The Parisians' judiciary did not convict him on the basis of the imitation, but rather because of Sperati's \\"deceitful intentions\\". He was convicted in April 1948. After the guilt verdict  Jean de Sperati did not have to serve his prison sentence on the grounds of his age ‚Äì he was already over 64 years old. In 1954 he sold all his remaining forgeries as well as all the clich√©s to the \\"British Philatelic Association.\\" He then withdrew from the forgery business and promised never again to falsify a stamp. His motive for selling the tools of his trade to the \\"British Philatelic Association\\" was to prevent them falling into the possession of someone who would imitate his work. Jean de Sperati died three years later in Aix-les-Bains at the age of 73.  His life's work The stamp forgeries of Jean de Sperati are some of the best of the world. Many of them remain undetected in various collections. Jean de Sperati falsified the most valuable rarities of the stamp world. He did this with an inimitable precision. A Sperati forgery is far from worthless. They obtain high prices as special collectables. Jean de Sperati paid great attention to the accuracy of the postmark when falsifying the stamps. Therefore, postmarks found on his forgeries are limited to those of larger cities. Sperati's forgeries are currently valuable in the philatelic market. He probably produced more than 5,000 forgeries.

It is a provision whereby Congress passes a statute granting authority to the President and reserving for itself the ability to override, through simple majority vote, individual actions taken by the President pursuant to that authority. It has also been widely used by state governments. Federal government The legislative veto was first developed in context of the delegation to the president to reorganize governmental agencies and was first authorized by the Legislative Appropriations Act in 1932. It was furthered by the necessities of providing for national security and foreign affairs immediately prior to and during World War II. While the scope of the nondelegation doctrine was greatly limited, Congress wished to provide a method of retaining power over delegated authority, and used the legislative veto as a method of allowing the Executive Branch to respond flexibly to events under \\"intelligible principles\\" while allowing Congress to overturn Presidential actions that would have lacked sufficient support for legislation explicitly authorizing them. The legislative veto provision found in federal legislation took several forms. Some laws established a veto procedure that required a simple resolution passed by a majority vote of one chamber of Congress. Other laws required a concurrent resolution passed by both the House and the Senate. Some statutes made the veto process more difficult by requiring not just a majority vote of one or both houses, but a majority of the membership of the legislative body, present or not. Some designated neither the House nor the Senate, but authorized one or more Congressional committees to exercise the veto on behalf of Congress. The proliferation of legislative veto provisions in legislation raised a series of constitutional questions. Congress until relatively recently had applied the veto provisions to some action taken by the President or another executive officer‚Äîsuch as a reorganization of an agency, the lowering or raising of tariff rates, the disposal of federal property‚Äîthen began expanding the device to give itself a veto over regulations issued by executive branch agencies, and proposals were made to give Congress a veto over all regulations issued by executive branch independent agencies. INS v. Chadha In Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), the Supreme Court held a legislative veto on the part of one chamber of the legislature unconstitutional as violating both the principle of bicameralism embodied in Article I, Section 1 and Section 7, and the presentment provisions of Clauses 2 and 3 of Section 7. The Court's analysis of the presentment issue stated that a provision for a two-chamber veto, though complying with bicameralism, and a provision for veto by a Congressional committee suffer the same constitutional infirmity. In the words of dissenting Justice White, the Court in Chadha \\"sound[ed] the death knell for nearly 200 other statutory provisions in which Congress has reserved a 'legislative veto.'\\" Constitutional Convention Delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 that drafted the U.S. Constitution considered and rejected proposals for a legislative veto designed to reconcile the states to the federal union. Edmund Randolph proposed that: \\"The National Legislature ought to be impowered [sic] . . . to negative all laws passed by the several States contravening in the opinion of the National Legislature the articles of Union.\\" The provision became part of Alexander Hamilton's proposal for a new government based on national consolidation, all but eliminating state sovereignty. States As of 1975, 10 states' constitutions allowed the governor to reorganize state government departments subject to a legislative veto: Alaska, California, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Vermont. Three states had statutes authorizing this procedure: Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations: SCIR State Legislative Program (November 1975), 28.

Caba√±as regarded Emiliano Zapata as his role model and he never abandoned his Christian faith, as can be seen in Gerardo Tort's film documentary on him.Prepara Gerardo Tort nueva cinta sobre Lucio Caba√±as  Teacher  He was born in El Porvenir, of Atoyac de √Ålvarez, in the state of Guerrero. He became politically active when he studied at the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College and was a leader of the local student union. In 1962 he was elected to the post of General Secretary of the Federation of Socialistic Peasant Students of Mexico. When he began work as a teacher, he also mediated problems at other schools.  Revolutionary  When a rector of Juan √Ålvarez school in Atoyac demanded that all pupils wear school uniforms, Caba√±as argued that some families were so poor they could hardly feed their children, not to mention buy school uniforms. The rector was fired but his supporters remained. When an 18 May 1967 strike action ended in shooting and deaths, Caba√±as fled to the mountains and joined the group of Genaro V√°zquez Rojas until V√°zquez' death on 2 February 1972. Caba√±as led a guerrilla group, the Party of the Poor and Peasants' Brigade Against Injustice. They numbered perhaps 300 members and lived in the Guerrero Mountains. He financed his group through kidnappings and bank robberies. The Mexican government sent 16,000 soldiers to the Sierra Madre de Atoyac Mountains to hunt him. Fifty of them died during the chase. In December 1974, Caba√±as kidnapped Rub√©n Figueroa, senator and future governor of Guerrero. When government troops tried to rescue the senator, Caba√±as was killed by the Mexican Army. Some say Caba√±as did not die but ended up in jail. If that was the case he probably would have been executed so that sympathizers would believe the rebellion ended with his death. Guerrero was in crisis and the city of Acapulco was suffering a slump in its tourist industry, due to the political violence that had plagued the region in the early seventies.  Legacy  There are a number of legends about him, including that he had five women bodyguards and carried a bag full of money that he distributed to the poor. Those are most likely \\"tall tales\\"; similar legends have been built around Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. In recent, years, Caba√±as has become a left-wing icon in Mexico, much like Che Guevara and Subcomandante Marcos. During recent social movements, including the 2006 clashes between teachers and the state government of Oaxaca, Caba√±as's face appeared on banners alongside those of Guevara and Vladimir Lenin.  His Works  The writer Carlos Montemayor recounts the history of the Party of the Poor in his book ‚ÄúGuerra en el Para√≠so‚Äù, 1990 (War in Paradise). Also the book entitled El guerrillero written by Camarada Ernesto refers to Lucio Caba√±as, the PDLP and the sierra.See the documentary \\"La Guerrilla y la Esperanza: Lucio Caba√±as\\" (La Rabia Films, 2005).  Murder of his widow  On 3 July 2011, it was reported that his widow, Isabel Ayala Nava, was assassinated, along with her sister, as the two women exited a church in Xaltianguis, Guerrero.

Its southern half, in which it gives its name to the centre- west part of Hampstead -- having two current railway stations including the name Finchley Road -- is designated arterial and is of double standard road width or greater. The road is one of Central London's main radial roads -- connecting it to parts of, and two larger radial roads of, North London. A broader spur as a modern successor, Hendon Way, from the middle diverges to Brent Cross, once considered the south of Hendon, in North London where the M1 motorway starts. History Originally named Finchley New Road, it was built as a turnpike to provide a by-pass to the hillier route north from London through the village of Hampstead (which lay in the east of that parish). That route (now the route Haverstock Hill, Rosslyn Hill and North End Road) had two steep hills either side of Hampstead Village and was difficult for horses with carriages to negotiate when muddy. The Finchley Road Act was passed in 1826 and the new turnpike road was completed in 1835.T F T Baker, Diane K Bolton and Patricia E C Croot, 'Hampstead: Communications', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 9, Hampstead, Paddington, ed. C R Elrington (London, 1989), pp. 3-8. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol9/pp3-8 [accessed 4 May 2018]. This coincided with the Inner and Outer Circle to Regent's Park to the south. It started from what was then called the 'New Road' (now Euston Road, Marylebone Road - the first London bypass) and ran north. When the road 7 kilometres later crosses the boundary of Finchley, as today, its name thus becomes Regents Park Road (after the reverse destination). In the heart of what rapidly became Finchley Central it became Ballards Lane and joined the Great North Road in an inverted-V shaped junction south of Whetstone. The road exacted tolls at a tollgate mid- way (at Childs Hill). After construction, many grand houses were built along its length, especially near to Fortune Green, Childs Hill and Golders Green, south to north. Today the route follows the A41 which becomes Finchley Road at St. John's Wood tube station. It goes north through Swiss Cottage, then turns slightly north west, forming the border between Hampstead and West Hampstead and then turns north again at Child's Hill. The A41 diverges westward and Finchley Road becomes the A598. It continues past Golders Green Underground station, through Temple Fortune to the North Circular Road, crossing it at Henlys Corner. The A598 continues north of the North Circular Road into Finchley, but changes its name to Regents Park Road. It remains a heavily used route in and out of London. The most commercial part of the road is between Swiss Cottage Underground station and the O2 Centre. ;Stagecoaches, first omnibuses and shelved tramway proposal In 1856 as many as ten stagecoaches a day ran along Finchley Road, serving Swiss Cottage, where the Atlas Line, a business of these was begun about six years before. Omnibuses reached the area north of Swiss Cottage by way of Finchley Road as far as Finchley Road station before 1880. Later omnibuses were extended along Finchley Road to meet others from Edgware Road along West End Lane, continuing north to Childs Hill in Hendon. Motorbuses had replaced horse omnibuses by 1911. Plans for an extensive network of tramways, along Adelaide and Finchley roads, were dropped after opposition from the council, ground landlords, and residents. On 2 October 1993 five people were injured and damage caused when three bombs planted by the Provisional IRA exploded. Stations close to the road=Today The Hampstead part of the road is served by Finchley Road Underground station and Finchley Road & Frognal railway station, 435 metres apart on the North London Line (London Overground). The road has as such become the colloquial name for the part of Hampstead between West Hampstead and Hampstead-on-the-Hill which is centred on Hampstead Underground station. Historically The St John's Wood part of the road was served by Finchley Road railway station on the Midland Main Line (1868-1927).

She later left her husband to move to Dover where she married a surgeon by the name of Thomas Day, prompting her arrest and trial in Maidstone for bigamy. After the trial she visited Cologne where she had a brief affair with a local nobleman. He gave her valuable presents, pressed her for marriage and began the preparations for a wedding. She, however, slipped out of Germany with all the presents and most of her landlady's money, returning to England through the Netherlands. Life of crime She returned to London in 1663 and took on the persona of an orphaned Princess van Wolway from Cologne. She claimed that she was born in Cologne and that her father was Henry van Wolway, Lord of Holmstein and that she had fled a possessive lover. In April 1663 she used this guise to marry a surgeon John Carleton, who was the brother-in-law of the landlord of the Exchange tavern which she frequented. After the wedding, however, an anonymous letter exposed her. James Basire, engraving of Mary Carleton as The German Princess with her Suppos'd Husband and Lawyer. Her trial in 1663 was the first recorded appearance of Mary Carleton. She was charged for masquerading as a German princess and marrying John Carleton in London under that name. She claimed that John Carleton himself had claimed to be a lord and was trying to extract himself from marriage as he had discovered there was no money in it. Divorce would have been an unheard of scandal in those times. Both sides of the conflict published pamphlets to support their own story. Mary Carleton was eventually acquitted. Afterwards Mary Carleton wrote her own account, The Case of Madam Mary Carleton, possibly through a ghostwriter. She also acted in a play about her life and gained a number of admirers who gave her more valuable gifts. She eventually married one of her admirers. Predictably she left him too, taking with her his money, valuables and keys while he was drunk. Carleton next pretended to be a rich virgin heiress fleeing an undesirable suitor whom her father had arranged for her. She even arranged that someone would send her letters that supposedly contained updates of family news. When her new landlady found and read them, she was convinced and became a matchmaker between Carleton and her nephew. Carleton arranged a new letter that claimed that her brother was dead and he had left her all he had, including her father's forthcoming inheritance. However, her father was even more determined to marry her to a suitor she detested. Her lover invited her to live with him but Carleton and an accomplice, disguised as a maid, stole his money. Over the following ten years Carleton used similar methods to defraud various other men and landlords, often with the aid of her maid. Some of the men were too embarrassed to reveal they had been duped. She was many times accused of theft but was jailed only briefly. Incarceration and execution thumb She was once arrested after stealing a silver tankard, and was sentenced to penal transportation and sent to Port Royal, Jamaica in 1671 which was the height of Henry Morgan‚Äôs buccaneering triumph, where she became a prostitute there. However in 1672, she either sneaked or conned her way aboard a ship and returned to London, again pretending to be a rich heiress and married an apothecary at Westminster. Naturally, she stole his money and left him. In December 1672, Carleton was captured when a turnkey from Newgate Prison, while searching for stolen loot at that time recognized her. On 16 January 1673 she was tried in the Old Bailey. Because she had returned from penal transportation without permission, she received a sentence of death penalty. She tried to plead the belly, but a jury of matrons was brought in to examine her, and found that this was not the case. At the place of execution at Tyburn, she told the waiting crowd that she had been a very vain woman, yet she hoped God would forgive her, as she forgave her enemies. Carleton was hanged on 22 January 1673. She was buried at the St. Martin's Churchyard. Later, someone wrote on her grave: > The German Princess here, against her will, lies underneath, and yet, oh > strange! lies still.

At his death The New York Times called him \\"one of France's most decorated Resistance heroes\\". Biography Henri Tanguy was born on 12 June 1908 in Morlaix, Brittany to a family of a sailor. Aged 14, he moved to Paris to work as a foundryman. In 1925, he joined the Young Communists and ended up as a secretary. He did his military service in 1929 with the 8th R√©giment de Zouaves in Oran, Algeria; on his return, he became an activist with the local metal workers union. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1937, Tanguy joined the International Brigades to fight for Spanish Republic. He was political commissar of the Andr√© Marty Battalion (made up of Franco-Belgian volunteers) which was part of the XIV International Brigade. He was wounded in the Battle of the Ebro in 1938. After the war, he returned to France. At the outbreak of World War II, Tanguy was conscripted into the French Army. After the surrender, he went underground with his wife C√©cile Le Bihan. He became one of the leaders of communist resistance in Paris and organized a group that became Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP). Tanguy used a nom de guerre of \\"Colonel Rol\\", after a close friend who had died in Spain. In June 1944, Tanguy took command of the French Forces of the Interior in the √éle-de-France. When Allied armies approached Paris, these forces took part in the liberation of Paris. Tanguy said, \\"Paris is worth 200,000 dead, so long as the city frees itself before the Free French armies arrive\\" Is Paris Burning? After five days of fighting, German General Dietrich von Choltitz notified Colonel Rol that he was ready to negotiate. Alongside Free French general Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, Tanguy accepted and signed the act of surrender on 25 August 1944. Like many resistance members, Tanguy later added his wartime pseudonym to his official name and became Rol-Tanguy. avenue du Colonel-Henri-Rol-Tanguy Rol-Tanguy joined the French 1st Army of General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny and served during the battles in Germany. After the war, he received the Croix de Guerre, the M√©daille de la R√©sistance and the Ordre de la Lib√©ration. He remained in the French army with a permanent commission until 1962. After his army career, Rol-Tanguy joined the central committee of the French Communist Party where he remained until 1987. He lived in the department of Loir-et-Cher. In 1994, he received the Grand Croix de la L√©gion d'honneur and, in 1996, received an honorary citizenship from Spain for his part in the International Brigades. Henri Rol-Tanguy died on 8 September 2002, and received a salutation in the Invalides from Jacques Chirac, the recently re-elected President of France. In 2004 he was commemorated at Place Denfert-Rochereau, in Paris, with a plaque, and the metro station there was sub-titled Colonel Rol-Tanguy.

When it opened in June 2003, it was the longest cable-stayed bridge in Ireland until 19 October 2009, when the River Suir Bridge opened on the N25. Due to environmental concerns, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was carried out for the bridge separately from the M1 EIS‚Äîthe first such formal EIS carried out and published for a bridge in Ireland. The bridge was built from 2000 to 2003. It was designed Roughan & O'Donovan consulting engineers,Roughan & O'Donovan - Projects - Mary McAleese Boyne Valley Bridge who were awarded the ACEI Presidential Award in 2005 for the design.ACEI Member News Overview Designing a road bridge over the Boyne was not an easy task. At the chosen point, upstream from Drogheda, the ground level on the south is elevated, with a sudden drop while the north bank slopes gradually down to the river. The area is environmentally sensitive, especially the reed beds on the north bank and the flora and fauna of Yellow Island in the middle of the river. The area has a rich heritage as it is also situated adjacent to the area in which the Battle of the Boyne took place in 1690. The answer was a cable-stayed bridge. Although at a cost of ‚Ç¨35 million it would be more expensive than a standard road bridge, it could incorporate a much longer main span without the need for supports in the river, so the engineers could protect the river and the island from any interference. It would also look attractive, with a tall pylon at the south side and cable stays fanning out from it, supporting the main structure. Construction was carried out by Cleveland Bridge U.K. Ltd. Construction methodology by Richard Hornby & Bruce Ramsay of Cleveland Bridge. The bridge is the first cable stay bridge in the world constructed using the incremental launching method (ILM) for the superstructure erection. The construction was commenced in May 2000 and the bridge opened on 9 June 2003.Boyne bridge adds to areas historical legacy Drogheda Independent, 2003-05-16. The bridge is managed under a public-private partnership between the National Roads Authority on behalf of the Irish Government and a private company, Celtic Roads Group. The concession company has an obligation to maintain the road for 30 years. The bridge and motorway are tolled in both directions to finance its construction and maintenance, and to generate profit for Celtic Roads Group. In 2006, the Bridge was awarded the Excellence Award (Civil) from the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland.ACEI Excellence Award (Civil) 2006 Name In October 2012, Meath County Council proposed renaming the Boyne River Bridge after former President of Ireland, Mary McAleese to honour her contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process. The name Mary McAleese Bridge was initially proposed,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-19951777 but some felt the name should reflect the local area, so on 8 June 2013 a ceremony was held to rename the bridge the Mary McAleese Boyne Valley Bridge.

The Kokikai style emphasizes natural movement, ki development, relaxation, good posture and mind-body coordination. It is a minimalist martial art that focuses on making techniques effective while using little physical effort. An axiom of the style is ‚Äúminimum effort for maximum effect.‚Äù The name Kokikai means ‚Äúschool of radiant ki‚Äù. The style lists four basic principles: *Keep One point (to develop calmness) *Relax progressively *Find Correct Posture (in everything) *Develop your Positive Mind The style was founded by Shuji Maruyama, and continues to be led by him. He continues to develop the art, so there is no set textbook way of performing any technique. Maruyama was originally sent to the United States in 1966 by the Aikikai Hombu. He taught in the US for many years. When Koichi Tohei left Aikikai to found Ki-Aikido, Maruyama followed him.

Clyde D. Hood is a former electrician from Mattoon, Illinois. In 1994 Hood formed Omega Trust and Trading Limited and began to lecture to church groups. He said that the Lord had given him a mission. He claimed that he was one of the international traders who could make secret multimillion-dollar deals to benefit humanitarian programs through debentures and \\"prime bank notes\\" in foreign banks. Hood asked for an investment of $100 and promised a payout of $5,100 within 275 days. He wanted the money delivered wrapped in aluminum foil and via Federal Express because U.S. federal government was trying to block the trades through the United States Postal Service. Therefore, the scheme should remain secret. Thousands of people from USA and overseas sent money. The program stopped accepting new investors in 1995. By that time, Hood had received more than $10 million. He began to present number of excuses as to why investors had not been paid, blaming administrative costs, problems with foreign banks and international financial conflicts. When some people still wanted to join, Hood and accomplices claimed that they could sell share units of people who had wanted to leave the program. The estimated total amount of money was $20 million. In addition, Hood began new investment schemes named Alpha and Destiny and obtained more money from those who had invested to Omega. With the money Hood and his associates bought land and businesses in Mattoon, gave no-interest loans and made trips to Europe. Some of the money also went to finance businesses of other Hood associates like construction contractor Chris Engel. Engel later cooperated with the police and let them tape a phone conversation with Hood. Hood lawyer Steve Ryan was also later removed from the case when he was subpoenaed as a witness and for possible collusion. Clyde Hood and his 18 associates were indicted in 2000. Some of them pleaded guilty or were convicted of multiple counts of fraud, mail fraud, money laundering and filing a false tax return (see ). On April 10, 2001, Hood pleaded guilty to mail or wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, and filing a false tax return. On January 24, 2002 Hood was sentenced to prison for 14 years and was fined $5,000. Five of his associates were convicted of active participation of the scheme and were ordered to make restitution. Thirteen associates were convicted of money laundering. Three hundred fifty-five victims received restitution from forfeited Omega Trust funds to the total of $1,697,310.00.

Often compared to the work of Yves Klein, his own work anticipated, and directly influenced, the work of a generation of younger Italian artists brought together by the critic Germano Celant in the first Arte Povera exhibition held in Genoa, 1967.Grove Art Online, Arte Povera, Manzoni is most famous for a series of artworks that call into question the nature of the art object, directly prefiguring Conceptual Art.Grove Art Online, Piero Manzoni, essay by Laural Weintraub,Tate Online His work eschews normal artist's materials, instead using everything from rabbit fur to human excrement in order to \\"tap mythological sources and to realize authentic and universal values\\". His work is widely seen as a critique of the mass production and consumerism that was changing Italian society (the Italian economic miracle) after World War II.Art Invest/Manzoni biography Italian artists such as Manzoni had to negotiate the new economic and material order of post-war Europe through inventive artistic practices which crossed geographic, artistic, and cultural borders. Manzoni died of myocardial infarction in his studio in Milan on February 6, 1963. His contemporary Ben Vautier signed Manzoni's death certificate, declaring it a work of art. Biography Manzoni was born in Soncino, province of Cremona. His full name was Count Meroni Manzoni di Chiosca e Poggiolo.Piero Manzoni, Catalog Raison√©, Battino & Palazzoli, p162 Self-taught as an artist, Manzoni first exhibited at the Soncino's Castle in Soncino in August 1956, at the age of 23. His early work was broadly gestural, and showed the influence of Milanese proponents of Nuclear Art, such as Enrico Baj.Manzoni, Celant, Electa, p22 His later works, from approximately 1957 until his death in 1963, questioned and satirized the status of the art object as it had been conceived throughout modernism. Influences include earlier (though still active) artists like Marcel Duchamp and contemporaneous practitioners Ben Vautier and Yves Klein.Silk, Gerald. Myths and Meanings in Manzoni's Merda d'artista, Art Journal, Vol. 52, No. 3, Autumn, 1993 Achromes Achrome, 1961-62. Manzoni's work changed irrevocably after visiting Yves Klein's exhibition 'Epoca Blu' at the Galleria Apollinaire in Milan, January 1957.Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p82 This exhibition consisted of 11 identical blue monochromes. By the end of the year he had ceased producing work influenced by the prevailing trends in Art Informel, to works that responded directly to Klein's monochromes.Piero Manzoni, Catalog Generale, First Vol, Celant Called Achromes, they invariably looked white but were actually colourless. In these paintings Manzoni experimented with various pigments and materials. Initially favouring canvases coated in gesso (1957‚Äì1958), he also worked with kaolin, another form of white clay often used in the production of porcelain.Piero Manzoni, Germano Celant, p 262 The kaolin works are generally made from clay covered canvases folded horizontally, or sometimes cut-out squares of canvas coated in the clay and adhered onto the canvas; he created just nine large-scale relief paintings depicting folded cloth.Scott Reyburn (October 7, 2014), Auction Houses Gear Up for Frieze Week New York Times. As well as Yves Klein, these works showed the influence of Lucio Fontana and Alberto Burri and the American artist Robert Rauschenberg, who had painted neutral white canvases in 1951.Rauschenberg/ Art and Life, Kotz, Abrams p76 Later he would create Achromes from white cotton wool, fiberglass, rabbit skin and bread rolls. He also experimented with phosphorescent paint and cobalt chloride so that the colours would change over time. In addition to these fabricated materials, the artist's own bodily products and features became art. In addition to his famous Artist's Shit (Merda d'artista), in which Manzoni's own excrement became a series of art objects, the use of fingerprints, blood, and breath also figured into his experimental body of work. Gallery Azimuth Manzoni founded the Gallery Azimuth in Milan in 1959 with the artist Enrico Castellani, and staged a series of revolutionary exhibitions of multiples. The first, 12 Linee (12 Lines) took place in December 1959, quickly followed by Corpi d'Aria (Bodies of Air) in May 1960.Manzoni, Celant, Electa 2007, p207 This was an edition of 45 balloons on tripods that could be blown up by the buyer, or the artist himself, depending on the price paid. In July 1960 he exhibited Consumption of Art by the Art-Devouring Public, in which he hard-boiled 70 eggs, printed his thumbprint onto them, and after eating several himself handed them out to the audience to eat. The eggs themselves were titled Uova con impronta (Egg With Thumbprint). This was the last exhibition by Manzoni at Azimuth, after which the gallery was forced to close when the lease ran out. Although the invitation named the Gallery Azimuth as the location of the opening, the actual event took place at the Studio Filmgiornale Sedi in Milan. The discrepancy between the location on the invitation and the film studio where the event was recorded further complicates the role and space of art as it was expected to be seen. Artist's Breath, 1960. Artist's Breath Contemporaneously with the Bodies of Air (Corpi D'Aria), Manzoni produced the Artist's Breaths (Fiato d'Artista), a series of red, white or blue balloons, inflated and attached to a wooden base inscribed \\"Piero Manzoni- Artist's Breath\\". The works continued Manzoni's obsession with the limits of physicality, whilst parodying the Art World's obsession with permanence, and also provided a poignant Memento Mori. Artist's Shit In May 1961 Manzoni created 90 small cans, sealed with the text Artist's Shit (Merda d'Artista). Each 30-gram can was priced by weight based on the current value of gold (around $1.12 a gram in 1960).Poop Culture: How America is Shaped by its Grossest National Product by Dave Praeger The contents of the cans remain a much-disputed enigma, since opening them would destroy the value of the artwork. Various theories about the contents have been proposed, including speculation that it is plaster. In the following years, the cans have spread to various art collections all over the world and netted large prices, far outstripping inflation. A tin was sold for ‚Ç¨ 124,000 at Sotheby's on May 23, 2007; in October 2008 tin 83 was offered for sale at Sotheby's with an estimate of ¬£ 50‚Äì70,000. It sold for ¬£97,250.Catalogue item from Sotheby's 20th Century Italian Art sale, 20 October 2008 It was described as: On October 16, 2015, tin 54 was sold at Christies for the astonishing sum of ¬£182,500. The tins were originally to be valued according to their equivalent weight in gold ‚Äì $37 each in 1961 ‚Äì with the price fluctuating according to the market. Other works from this period include limited edition thumbprints, and the Declarations of Authenticity, 1961-61, a printed multiple that could be bought, proving the owner's status as either part or whole work of art, depending on the price paid. He also designated a number of people, including Umberto Eco, as authentic works of art gratis. Various other experimental pieces by Manzoni included trying to create a mechanical animal as a moving sculpture and using solar energy as a power source. In 1960 he created a sphere that was held aloft on a jet of air.  Other works  *Magic Bases (Magisk Sockkel, 1961), a series of wooden plinths that could be stood on to acquire status of 'Living Sculpture'. *Lines of Exceptional Length (1960‚Äì61). Lines drawn on paper, the longest of which was 7.2 km, intended to be left in every major city in the world, which would equal the length of the equator when joined. *Base of the World (Socle du Monde, 1961). A large metal plinth, inscribed 'The Base Of The World, Homage To Galileo' placed upside down in a field in Herning, Denmark. It announces that the whole world is a work of art, rendering the artist obsolete. *Piero Manzoni; The Life And Works (1963), published posthumously by Jes Petersen.

She played the character for 55 years from January 1961 to January 2016 (with a brief cameo in October 2019), making her the longest- serving female cast member in a British TV soap opera. She is the mother of sports journalist Oliver Holt. She was appointed an MBE in the 2010 Queens Birthday Honours list with her fellow co-star and friend, Barbara Knox, who portrays Rita Sullivan. Early life  Derbyshire was born in Urmston, Lancashire and from the age of 17, was appearing in plays broadcast on the radio. After several small parts on television, she joined the cast of Coronation Street, first appearing as Miss Nugent in episode 15 in January 1961 (the character appeared as an extra in episode 4 in December 1960 played by an uncredited walk-on actress). The character was then given the forename Emily in 1962. Derbyshire has a degree in teaching, trained at the Northern School of Music, and also passed her examination at the Royal Academy of Music. She began teaching speech and drama, but had always wanted to act. While on the bus one day, she passed Chorlton Repertory Theatre, and asked for an audition. She was enrolled as a student, and later became assistant stage manager. From there she joined Century Theatre's mobile touring company, and appeared in theatre all over the country, subsequently appearing in repertory theatre throughout Britain. Personal life  She married engineer Thomas W. Holt on 1 April 1965, and the following year they had a son, Oliver. The couple have a cottage in Cheshire, and Derbyshire's interests include opera, reading, going to concerts and holidaying in Vienna and Venice. Derbyshire has a reputation for reclusiveness. She never joins fellow cast members at awards ceremonies or other events, and has never yet appeared in any of the publicity videos on the Coronation Street website. She has only twice appeared onscreen out of character, when in 1988 she gave a rare interview in a documentary tribute to cast member and good friend, Margot Bryant, who played Minnie Caldwell. In 2005, she also gave an interview for an ITV programme aimed at deaf viewers, speaking about working with the deaf actress Ali Briggs, who was playing Emily's niece, Freda Burgess, for which she was interviewed on the set and dressed in character. She also appeared, along with the rest of the Coronation Street cast, in episodes of This Is Your Life for Patricia Phoenix in 1972, Jack Howarth in 1974, Julie Goodyear in 1980, William Roache in 1985 and Anne Kirkbride in 1998. Her son, Oliver Holt, has denied that she is reclusive, pointing out that she is simply private, and \\"one of the last of a dying breed of old-fashioned actresses who do it for the love of acting, not for all the attendant publicity\\". She is a grandmother to Oliver's children, Alice, Edie and Joe. Derbyshire is also a godmother to William Roache's three children and Barbara Knox's daughter, Maxine. Derbyshire has been on a break from Coronation Street for personal reasons since December 2015. Her departure aired on 1 January 2016 and was originally billed as only a six-month sabbatical. She returned for a cameo appearance as part of the celebrations for Ken's 80th birthday in October 2019, being seen on a video message wishing him a happy birthday. Ken remarked that it would be her 90th birthday \\"next week\\", which makes Emily two years older than Derbyshire. Honours  Derbyshire was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours, for services to drama.

Photo of the Marshall Way bridge over the Arizona Canal in Downtown Scottsdale. Scottsdale Road pedestrian bridge over the canal designed by Paolo Soleri. Arizona Falls, part of G.R. Herberger Park in Phoenix, Arizona. The Arizona Canal is a major canal in central Maricopa County that led to the founding of several communities, now among the wealthier neighborhoods of suburban Phoenix, constructed in the late 1880s. Flood irrigation of residential yards is still common in these neighborhoods, using a system of lateral waterways connected via gates to the canal itself.Brief description of flood irrigation in Phoenix by Salt River Project Like most Valley canals, its banks are popular with joggers and bicyclists. The canal, nearly long, is the northernmost canal in the Salt River Project's water distribution system.map Beginning at Granite Reef Diversion Dam, northeast of Mesa, it flows west across the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, downtown Scottsdale, Phoenix's Arcadia and Sunnyslope neighborhoods, Glendale, and Peoria before ending at New River near Arrowhead Towne Center. History William John Murphy was hired in 1883 to spearhead its construction, which was completed in May 1885. He then founded Glendale; its downtown Murphy Park is named for him. Nearby Peoria was also founded within the decade. Several miles upstream (east), on the canal's south side were purchased in 1888 by a former Civil War chaplain named Major Winfield Scott, establishing what is now Scottsdale. Murphy later built the Ingleside Club hotel near Scottsdale (in what is now Arcadia), laying the foundation for the area's vital tourism economy. Several resorts - The Phoenician, Biltmore, Royal Palms, a Pointe Hilton and a Ritz-Carlton - were all built close to the canal between 1929 and 1988. Also, five shopping malls of varying size and affluence - Borgata, Scottsdale Fashion Square, Biltmore Fashion Park, Metrocenter Mall and Arrowhead Towne Center - now reside along the canal's route. Five miles were added to the canal's western end in 1894, completing its length. A 750-kilowatt restored hydroelectric plant and art display opened in June 2003 in Arcadia, at a natural drop called Arizona Falls.Arizona Falls Scottsdale's Waterfront Project is aimed at revitalizing an area along the Arizona Canal just west of Scottsdale Road. The City of Scottsdale and the Scottsdale Public Art board engaged the architect Paolo Soleri who designed a bridge over the Arizona Canal in Downtown Scottsdale. The suspension bridge has two steel-clad, 64-foot pylons create a light beam on the walking surface to mark solar events.

The likeness was created from various reports from alleged victims and before the arrest of Rhynwick Williams. The London Monster was the name given to an alleged attacker of women in London between 1788 and 1790. The attacker had a signature behaviour of piquerism, the pricking or stabbing of victims with a knife, pin or needle. History The first reports of the Monster appeared in 1788. According to the victims (most of them from wealthier families), a large man had followed them, shouted obscenities and stabbed them in the buttocks. Some reports claimed an attacker had knives fastened to his knees. Other accounts reported that he would invite prospective victims to smell a fake nosegay and then stab them in the face with the spike hiding within the flowers. In all cases the alleged assailant would escape before help arrived. Some women were found with their clothes cut and others had substantial wounds. In two years the number of reported victims amounted to more than 50. The press soon named the maniac The Monster. Descriptions of the attacker varied greatly. Some men even founded a No Monster Club and began to wear club pins on their lapels to show that they were not the Monster. Londoners were outraged when the Bow Street Runners, the London police force, failed to capture the man. Philanthropist John Julius Angerstein promised a reward of ¬£100 for capture of the perpetrator. Armed vigilantes began to patrol in the city. Fashionable ladies began to wear copper pans over their petticoats. There were false accusations and attacks against suspicious people. Local pickpockets and other criminals used the panic to their advantage; they picked someone's valuables, pointed at him, shouted \\"Monster!\\", and escaped during the resulting mayhem. Arrest of Rhynwick Williams A 1790 engraving of Anne Porter On 13 June 1790, Anne Porter claimed she had spotted her attacker in St. James's Park. Her admirer, John Coleman, began a slow pursuit of the man, who realised he was being followed. When Rhynwick Williams, a 23-year-old florist, reached his house, Coleman confronted him, accusing him of insulting a lady, and challenged him to a duel. He eventually took Williams to meet Porter, who fainted when she saw him. Williams protested his innocence but, given the climate of panic, it was futile. He admitted that he had once approached Porter but had an alibi for another of the attacks. Magistrates charged Williams with defacing clothingRobbery, etc. Act 1719 (6 Geo 1 c23, s11) assault with intent to spoil garments‚Äîa crime that in the Bloody Code carried a harsher penalty than assault or attempted murder. During the trial, spectators cheered the witnesses for the prosecution and insulted those for the defence. One of the claimed victims confessed that she had not been attacked at all. Realising the absurdity of the situation, the court granted Williams a retrial. In the new trial Williams' defence lawyer was Irish poet Theophilus Swift, whose tactic was to accuse Porter of a scheme to collect the reward, Porter having married Coleman, who had received the reward money. Despite the fact that a number of alleged victims gave contradictory stories and that his employer and coworkers testified that he had an alibi for the most infamous attack, Williams was convicted on three counts and sentenced to two years each, for a total of six years in prison. He was released in December 1796. Historians have speculated whether Williams was the culprit and have even questioned whether the London Monster existed at all beyond the hysteria. Reports of Monster-like attacks continued to be reported for many years, although they lessened somewhat while Williams was imprisoned.

It borders Camp Hill, Holland Park, Stones Corner, Greenslopes, East Brisbane and Norman Park.  Toponymy  Coorparoo was chosen as the name of the suburb at a public meeting on 22 March 1875, before which it was known as Four Mile Camp. The name Coorparoo is likely derived from an Aboriginal name for Norman Creek, probably recorded by early surveyors as Koolpuroom. The word is thought to refer to either a place associated with mosquitoes, or a sound made by the 'gentle dove'. The latter explanation appears doubtful though, as 'gentle dove' may mean the spotted dove, which was introduced to the area in 1912, long after the name Coorparoo was adopted.  History = Aboriginal history  The Coorparoo Clan lived south of the Brisbane River and generally camped along creeks. Their name comes from Kulpurum, which was the word for Norman Creek or a tributary of it. They continued to occupy watercourse campsites after white settlement, but other clans from the region began to move into South Brisbane. In 1846, there were reports of Aborigines raiding produce along Norman Creek. In 1853, there was a fight between Ningy Ningy, Bribie Island, Amity Point, and Logan peoples at Norman Creek. A visitor in 1855 reported many camps and fishing spots between Stones Corner and the mouth of Norman Creek. In 1959 an eighty-year-old woman told of frequent corroborees on the banks of the creek in Norman Park. Corroborees were also held at a little creek that crossed Norfolk Street.  Urban development  On 17 June 1856, ten farms were sold from the Parish of Bulimba near Stones Corner. Investors bought all but two of them. The next year James Warner surveyed land on the other side of the road for a second land auction. Samuel Stevens donated two acres of his property near the junction of Cavendish and Old Cleveland Roads for use of a school. He declined the offer of naming the area \\"Steven's Town\\". Real estate map of Langlands Estate East, Coorparoo, 1886 In 1876, the Coorparoo State School was opened and Frederick Robinson began offering public transport in a wagonette from Coorparoo Junction to Victoria Bridge. The 1880s land boom was a spur to profit from land. John Black was the first to subdivide land in the area in 1882 and later a variety of subdivisions were offered to the public. The construction of the bridge at Stanley Street (1886) and the development of the Stanley Bridge Estate made the area more attractive to purchasers. In 1887, the tramway was extended to Buranda, putting the western end of Coorparoo close to tram travel. Estate map of the Seville Estate, Cavendish Road, Coorparoo, Brisbane, Queensland, 1888. Coorparoo had been part of the Bulimba Divisional Board since 1879. However, in 1888, as a result of dissatisfaction with this situation, a petition was taken resulting in the creation of Shire of Coorparoo. A bridge was built at Burnetts Swamp (Stones Corner) and important road improvements took place. Development was taking off. In 1889 there were 2,500 people in the shire. In February 1886 the\\"Langlands Estate, East Brisbane\\" was advertised to be auctioned by Arthur Martin & Co. The advertisement describes 568 allotments commencing a few yards beyond the junction of the Cleveland and Logan Roads, with extensive frontage to the Cleveland Road. A map advertising the auction shows the Nicklin residence on the estate. On 22 December 1888 \\"St Leonard's Estate\\" was advertised for auction by R. J. Cottell. A map advertising the auction shows the estate as adjoining the \\"Langlands Estate\\" and close to the Coorparoo railway station. A newspaper advertisement of the day notes that \\"St Leonard's Estate\\" can be reached \\"in a very few weeks by the train\\". In May 1889, on what is now known as Carina, 275 subdivided allotments of \\"Stanley Street Extended Estate\\" were advertised to be auctioned by James R. Dickson & Company. A map advertising the auction mentions 'free waggonettes from the Mart'. The floods of 1889 and 1893 hit the low-lying areas of Coorparoo. The flooding combined with the 1890s depression slowed development in the area. In 1900 there were actually fewer houses than there had been ten years earlier. The settlement was dense from Stones Corner to Kirkland Avenue (originally named Wecker Street but it was changed in 1914 in the wake of anti-German sentiment), but further out it was mainly bush with a few isolated farms and houses. The only major industry was the brickworks of Abraham James at St Leonards Street, which employed eighty men in the 1880s. After World War I, land prices increased as property sales boomed. Coorparoo did not really begin to expand again until the tram service was extended to Stones Corner in 1902 and Coorparoo Junction in 1915. The number of houses increased from 613 in 1911 to 1,467 ten years later. St Anne's Anglican Church opened circa 1958 in the Upper Cavendish Road area. It closed circa 1980s. Xavier Special School opened on 24 August 1970. In 2002 it merged with Camp Hill State High School and Whites Hill State School (both in Camp Hill) to form Whites Hill State College (in Camp Hill). Xavier Special School became the Xavier Special Education Unit within the College. In 2011 Brisbane School of Distance Education relocated to Coorparoo from its former site in West End. The school is the amalgamation of the Primary Correspondence School (opened on 24 January 1922), the Secondary Correspondence School (opened in 1958) and the Preschool Correspondence (opened in 1974).  Demographics  The 2016 Census recorded 16,282 residents in Coorparoo, of whom 51.2% were female and 48.8% were male. The median age of the population was 34; 4 years younger than the Australian average. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people made up 0.9% of the population. 70.7% of people living in Coorparoo were born in Australia, with the next most common countries of birth being India (3.6%), New Zealand (3%), England (2.5%), Nepal (0.9%), and China (0.7%). 77.6% of people only spoke English at home, while the other most common responses were Spanish (1.2%), Hindi (1.2%), Punjabi (1.1%), Mandarin (1%), and Greek (1%). The most common responses for religion were No Religion 29.8%, Catholic 28.6% and Anglican 11.2%.  Growth  In 2015, the old Myer Department store building on the corner of Old Cleveland Road and Cavendish Road was demolished. In its place are 3 residential towers with commercial development on the lower floors. The development, known as Coorparoo Square opened in 2017 and features a 10 screen Dendy cinema, Aldi Supermarket and speciality retailers and coffee shops. Under the development, will be a void for the future Eastern Busway station.  Sports  Cooparoo Cricket Club's (CCC) history can be traced back to the 1940s with the current club starting in 1980. Coorparoo C.C.'s clubhouse located at 18 Crown Street, Norman Park. Home games are played at Peter Burge Oval. Coorparoo is home of the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club who play their home games at Langlands Park. Langlands Park regularly hosts training sessions for the Queensland and Australian Rugby League teams when they are playing in Brisbane.

Tram Post  Education  State schools in Coorparoo include Coorparoo State School and Coorparoo Secondary College. There are four Catholic schools: St James Primary School, Loreto College Coorparoo (girls, 7‚Äì12), Mt Carmel Primary school (co-ed, prep‚Äì6), and Villanova College (boys, 5‚Äì12).  Parks  Brisbane City Council provides 30 parks in Coorparoo. They range in size from large to small and have a range of different facilities.  Landmarks  Coorparoo has a range of distinctive homes, buildings, and sites of interest, including: * Spanish Mission Revival homes along Cavendish Road. This was a popular inter-war house style introduced from California. * Ridgelands (1880s), built for the Blundell family * Cardington (1880s) at the corner of Norfolk Street and Cavendish Road.

Geert Jan Jansen was born in Waalre in the Netherlands. His engineer father was fond of art and Jansen became an art student. He befriended a US art dealer, Michel Podulke, who ran a gallery called Mokum in Amsterdam. Later, Jansen opened his own galleries, Jacob and Raam, but was not particularly successful. When his business went badly, he decided to sign posters of Karel Appel's lithographs and sell them as originals. Later, he made his first Karel Appel forgery and sold it for 2,600 guilders. Thus encouraged, he sent another forgery to London; auction house sent a photograph to Appel, who stated that it was genuine. The gouache was sold at a record price. In 1981, Dutch police were informed about a forged Bart van der Leck painting. They searched Jansen's house in Edam but found nothing. They did find 76 forged Appel lithographs in the ceiling of a local warehouse, but charges were not pressed. Short of evidence, the attorney general cut a deal with Jansen: He would not be charged if he would not make forgeries for three years. In 1988, Jansen released another batch of Appel paintings. When they were found to be forgeries, gallery owners blamed each other. In June 1988, police confiscated hundreds of Appel forgeries from the MAT gallery in Amsterdam. The owner of the gallery said that he had bought 100 Appel forgeries from the Tripple Tree Gallery, who had bought them from a dealer Henk Ernste in Paris. Ernste was later arrested but the case was settled with a 5.5 million guilder fine. During the furor, Jansen moved from the Netherlands to France with his mistress. In March 1994, \\"Jan van den Bergen\\" came to the auction house Karl & Faber in Munich. He claimed to be an art dealer from Orl√©ans and presented his business card. With him he had a Chagall drawing, an Asger Jorn gouache and a Karel Appel painting. The first two had written certificates of authenticity. He wanted them to be auctioned quickly and left in a hurry. Expert Sue Cubitt of the auction house had the works examined. The Chagall certificate had a misprint and she became suspicious. Jan Nieuwenhuizen Segaar, a representative of Karel Appel, contacted the artist who said that work was his but Cubitt was still suspicious. The Chagall committee in Paris verified that the certificate was a forgery and therefore the drawing was also a forgery. A similar thing happened with the Asger Jorn certificate. The auction house decided to withdraw all the works from sale because it could not guarantee their authenticity. Sue Cubitt decided to inform Ernst Sch√∂ller of the Stuttgart Fine Art and Antiquities squad. When Sue Cubitt and the police checked other auction catalogues, they noticed that similar works of art had been offered for sale and discovered Van den Bergen had offered these and other works for sale in auction houses around Europe. When Sch√∂ller checked the Orl√©ans gallery address, he found that it was a fake; there was a wine bottle company at that address. The trail of false addresses companies led Sch√∂ller and the French police to a farm in La Chaux near Poitiers. Jansen - who had used the name Van den Bergen - and his associate were arrested May 6, 1994. When police investigated the farm, they found 1600 forged artworks. Forged artists included Cocteau, Dufy, Ferdinand Erfmann, Charles Eyck, Leo Gestel, Bart van der Leck, Matisse, Mir√≥ and the most popular target of forgery, Picasso. French police had few leads and their appeal through the media brought no reports of forgery. Six years later, they checked the auction records of a Drouot gallery where Jansen had traded most of his forgeries through a number of different false names. They confiscated some suspicious paintings and threatened their buyers with complicity in the crime if they did not press charges against Jansen. Jansen went on trial in September 2000 in Orl√©ans. By that time, the police had thousands of forgeries. During the trial Jansen's lawyer demanded that the works not to be destroyed in case there were real works among them. However, most of the charges were later dropped - two of the buyers disappeared - and only two remained. Eventually Jansen was sentenced to one year imprisonment and four additional years suspended sentence. He was exiled from France for three years. All of his works were to be destroyed. Jansen planned to appeal. It is estimated that Geert Jan Jansen made ‚Ç¨10 million from his forgeries.

Uses Demeclocycline is officially indicated for the treatment of various types of bacterial infections. It is used as an antibiotic in the treatment of Lyme disease, acne, and bronchitis. Resistance, though, is gradually becoming more common, and demeclocycline is now rarely used for treatment of infections. Retrieved on October 27, 2008. It is widely used (though off-label in many countries including the United States) in the treatment of hyponatremia (low blood sodium concentration) due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) when fluid restriction alone has been ineffective. Physiologically, this works by reducing the responsiveness of the collecting tubule cells to ADH. The use in SIADH actually relies on a side effect; demeclocycline induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (dehydration due to the inability to concentrate urine). The use of demeclocycline in SIADH was first reported in 1975, and, in 1978, a larger study found it to be more effective and better tolerated than lithium carbonate, the only available treatment at the time. Demeclocycline used to be the drug of choice for treating SIADH. Meanwhile it might be superseded, now that vasopressin receptor antagonists, such as tolvaptan, became available. Contraindications Like other tetracyclines, demeclocycline is contraindicated in children and pregnant or nursing women. All members of this class interfere with bone development and may discolour teeth. Side effects and interactions These are similar to those of other tetracyclines. Skin reactions with sunlight have been reported. Like only few other known tetracycline derivatives, demeclocycline causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Furthermore demeclocycline might have psychotropic side effects similar to lithium. Tetracyclines bind to cations, such as calcium, iron (when given orally), and magnesium, rendering them insoluble and inadsorbable for the gastrointestinal tract. Demeclocycline should not be taken with food (particularly milk and other dairy products) or antacids. Mechanism of action As with related tetracycline antibiotics, demeclocycline acts by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit to inhibit binding of aminoacyl tRNA which impairs protein synthesis by bacteria. It is bacteriostatic (it impairs bacterial growth, but does not kill bacteria directly). Demeclocycline inhibits the renal action of antidiuretic hormone by interfering with the intracellular second messenger cascade (specifically, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activation) after the hormone binds to vasopressin V2 receptors in the kidney. Exactly how demeclocycline does this has yet to be elucidated, however.

Hall, and directed by David Schmoeller. It is the first film in the Puppet Master franchise and stars Paul Le Mat, Irene Miracle, Matt Roe, and Kathryn O'Reilly as psychics who are plotted against by a former colleague, using puppets animated by an Egyptian spell. Originally intended for theatrical release in summer 1989, before being released on home video the following September, Puppet Master was ultimately pushed to a direct-to-video release on October 12, 1989, as Charles Band felt he was likely to make more money this way than he would in the theatrical market. The film was very popular in the video market and since developed a large cult following that has led to the production of twelve sequels. Plot 1939, Bodega Bay Inn, California: An old puppeteer named Andr√© Toulon is putting the finishing touches on his newest puppet, Jester, before he brings it to life. Two Nazi spies get out of a car and head for Toulon's room while Kahn, another living puppet, warns him.

Upon arrival, they are surprise to find that not only does Neil has a wife, Megan, but that he has also killed himself, leaving instructions for Megan on the others‚Äô arrival. She leaves them with the body to pay respects and Dana stabs a long pin into Neil's corpse to verify that he is in fact dead. While getting settled into their rooms, the psychics experience different confusing visions of Neil. That night at dinner, Dana purposefully upsets Megan, causing her to leave the table and Pinhead, another animated doll, crawls out of Neil's casket. Alex follows Megan and tells her their history with her husband. Carissa, a psychometrist, can see any object's emotional history by touching it, Dana can tell fortunes and locate items and people, and Alex himself can foresee the future in his dreams. Neil was researching alchemy and with Frank's help discovered that Ancient Egyptians has created a method of reanimating to inanimate figurines, a power also discovered by Andr√© Toulon, the last true alchemist. But because Neil had not made contact with them in a while, Dana and the rest think he abandoned them and took whatever he was looking for himself, and they are there to take it and settle the score. That night, Theresa the housekeeper attends to the fire and is attacked by Pinhead with a poker fulfilling Dana's fortune for her. Gallagher's body has moved to a chair which Megan finds, causing her to faint; Alex attends to her while the others return the body to the casket. After Blade finds protective spells on Alex's and Dana's rooms he moves on to Carissa and Frank's, who are having very loud sex and disrupting Alex and Dana's sleep. Two more puppets, Tunneler and Leech Woman, enter. Tunneler kills Carissa by drilling into her face when she inspects a noise coming from under the bed and Leech Woman vomits leeches onto Frank, who's tied to the bed, draining his blood. Coming back from a walk, Dana finds Gallagher's body in her room and she is attacked by Pinhead, who breaks her leg. Pinhead chases her and repeatedly strangles and punches her until she manages to knock him away and crawl to the elevator, only to have her throat cut by Blade, fulfilling her fortune. Alex suffers more nightmares, eventually woken by Megan, who shows him Andr√© Toulon's diary and tells him that Neil found Toulon's secret to reanimation. Alex has a vision of Neil and they rush downstairs to escape but find the bodies of Dana, Frank, and Carissa sitting around the dining table accompanied by the newly resurrected Neil. He explains that did commit suicide, but he used Toulon's secrets to become reanimate himself in an effort to become immortal. He admits to killing Megan's parents and expresses disgust for the puppets, violently throwing Jester, but is satisfied that he now has human puppets to experiment with. The other puppets see this attack and descend on Neil; Tunneler takes out his legs and Blade pins him down while Leech Woman vomits a leech into his mouth and Pinhead finally breaks his neck. The next day, Megan sees Alex off and as she ascends the stairs, she brings Dana's stuffed dog to life.

These blocks are usually harvested from nearby rivers or lakes when they become frozen in winter. The first known ice palace (or, rather, ice house, –ª–µ–¥—è–Ω–æ–π –¥–æ–º in Russian) appeared in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was the handiwork of Empress Anna. Anna Ivanovna, Empress of Russia, commissioned an ice palace in St. Petersburg, Russia, during the winter of 1739-40. Architect Piotr Eropkin and scientist Georg Wolfgang Krafft used huge ice blocks measuring long by wide, joined together with frozen water, to build the palace. The city recreates the ice palace every winter. Anna Ivanovna's palace In this 1878 painting by Valery Jacobi, the scared newly-weds sit on the icy bed to the left; the jocular woman in golden dress is Empress Anna herself. In the cold winter of 1739-1740, Anna Ivanovna gave an order to build a palace made of ice in St. Petersburg. The palace and the surrounding festivities were part of the celebration of Russia's victory over the Ottoman Empire. She ordered the architect Pyotr Yeropkin to design the building.\\"The Construction of the Ice Palace\\" It was built under the supervision of Georg Krafft who left a detailed description of the palace.–õ–µ–¥–µ–Ω—è—â–∏–µ –ø–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ < –¢–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ < –ü–æ–ø—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω–∞—è –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∫–∞ The palace was 20 meters tall and 50 meters wide. Huge ice blocks were \\"glued\\" together with water. The garden was filled with ice trees with ice birds and an ice statue of an elephant. The outer walls were lined with ice sculptures. Before the palace there were artillery pieces also made of ice. The palace was also furnished with furniture made of ice, including an ice bed with ice mattress and pillows. The whole structure was surrounded with a tall wooden fence. The festivities involving the Ice Palace included a mock wedding of two jesters.The tradition of mock weddings has been known in Russia since Peter the Great. In fact, even the wedding festivities of Anna herself included a mock wedding of Peter's jester. Prince had married an Italian woman. Empress Anna saw this as an affront because she was a catholic, not eastern orthodox. The wife died soon after but Anna did not forgive Galitzine and decided to punish him in an unusual manner. She first ordered him to become a jester. The Empress selected prince Galitzine a new wife, an unattractive Kalmyk maidservant . She forced the prince to marry her and displayed the newlyweds in a procession where they rode an elephant, dressed as clowns, and were followed by a number of circus freaks and farm animals. In the palace the newlyweds were closed naked into an icy nuptial chamber under heavy guard. The couple survived the night because the bride traded a pearl necklace with one of the guards for a sheepskin coat. Empress Anna died the following year and the castle [for obvious reasons] did not survive the next summer. The Russian reading public was made aware of Anna's mock palace in 1835, when Ivan Lazhechnikov (1792‚Äì1869) described her escapade in The Ice House, one of the first historical novels in the language. The novel was made into a film as early as 1927. The Mirrored World (2012), a novel by the author of The Madonnas of Leningrad, also depicts this episode in history. Other ice palaces Many ice palaces have been built since. In North America, one was built in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1883. Eagle River, Wisconsin, has constructed an ice castle most years going back to the late 1920s.http://www.eagleriver.org/icecastle.asp Eagle River Ice Castle The capital city of Minnesota, St. Paul, has played host to several ice palaces since 1886 as part of the city's Winter Carnival. Some palaces have featured ice blocks numbering in the tens of thousands. A 1992 structure had 25,000 and stretched to a height of 150 feet (45.7 m). One built in 1941 had 30,000 ice blocks. St. Paul last built an ice palace in January 2018. Every year since 1954 the Quebec City Winter Carnival in Quebec City has featured ice palaces or ice castles of various sizes, depending on the budget, and has often used them to imprison briefly those persons who were judged to be too glum in this time of good cheer. Civil Works Administration: \\"The Indian New Deal Ice Palace\\", Lake Bemidji, Minnesota--1934 Saranac Lake, New York has an annual winter carnival in which an ice palace is built. This tradition dates back to the 1897, when it was initiated to raise the spirits of tuberculosis patients who came to the town for recuperation over the long winter. Saparmurat Niyazov, the recently deceased president of Turkmenistan, ordered the construction of a huge ice palace near the capital city of A≈ügabat in April 2004. Although the appearance of the original ice palace is disputable, it has been rebuilt each year since 2005 in Saint-Petersburg, Russia and is open to the public. In 1895, the mining town of Leadville, Colorado, was in an economic slump, due to the depletion of gold and silver ores, and the Panic of 1893. The townspeople were looking for a way to increase tourism in the area, and hit upon the idea of a giant ice castle. City leaders financed the endeavor, and the structure was completed in December of that year. It was opened to the public New Year's Day, 1896, and was an immediate sensation. It was huge. Gleaming blue-white walls three feet thick surrounded an ice skating rink, restaurants, ballrooms, a merry-go-round, and a toboggan slide. Thousands of tourists came to Leadville to see the frozen castle. Special trains brought visitors up the mountains of Colorado, and word spread rapidly around the country. The colossal structure was built on a site roughly five acres in size, on the west side of Harrison Avenue, using almost 5 tons of ice. Boiling water was poured over this, which quickly froze, thus strengthening the walls even further. The Ice Palace remained open for only three months, and it was not a financial success. An early spring thaw ensured that the structure would not last but a short time. Because of the fact it did not pull in much money, the Leadville city council decided not to rebuild the following winter. Periodically, there has been a resurgence of interest in building another Ice Palace, but nothing has ever come of it. The original site has since been built up with houses. There have been modern developments in ice construction, including the now widespread use of snice as a mortar- alternative, instead of the more simple, but less reliable, use of water alone. In popular culture *In the 1920 short story \\"The Ice Palace\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the protagonist, Sally Carrol, visits a recreation of the 1886-1887 St. Paul ice palace in the early 20th century. *In the 2002 James Bond film Die Another Day, villain Gustav Graves has built a massive ice palace in Iceland for a demonstration to the world media. He later melts it with a solar beam from his \\"Icarus\\" satellite. *In the 2013 animated Disney film Frozen, Queen Elsa builds herself an ice palace using her ice powers.

The band have collectively released three studio albums. A fourth album was planned, but in 2017 the band announced their split up. Biography Spawn of Possession formed in February 1997, consisting of Jonas Bryssling (guitar), Jonas Karlsson (guitar), and Dennis R√∂ndum (drums). After three years the band recorded their first demo, The Forbidden, and right after found bass guitar player Nick Dewerud to fill the empty bass spot. A year later the band went to the studio to record their second demo, Church of Deviance, and in December 2001 Spawn of Possession signed a deal with Unique Leader Records. The band worked on new material for the next six months and in June 2002 began recording their debut album, Cabinet. The band ended up in the Pama Studios together with the highly acclaimed producer and engineer Magnus Sedenberg with whom they had worked on previous recordings, and released Cabinet. To promote the album, they first toured Europe for four weeks, together with Disavowed, Vile, Inhume, and Mangled. Shortly after followed a six-week North American tour together with Unique Leader label mates Severed Savior, Pyaemia, and Gorgasm. Travelling coast to coast including a five gigs ride to Canada, they played no less than 27 shows on this tour. After coming back from the US came another European tour, as part of the annual No Mercy package, with bands such as Cannibal Corpse, Hypocrisy, Kataklysm, Exhumed, Vomitory, and Carpathian Forest. After this spring-tour summerfestival the band perform at eight festivals, including Fuck the Commerce (Germany), Stonehenge (Netherlands), Grind You Mother (Italy), and Mountains of Death (Switzerland). During this period and the beginning of fall 2004, Spawn of Possession also started to work on new material. In mid-September the band joined Cannibal Corpse as direct support on a 24 show tour throughout Scandinavia and the Baltic/Eastern European states. The successor to the debut album is titled Noctambulant and was released in July 2006 by Neurotic Records. On May 11, 2009, the band posted a small preproduction teaser from their as yet untitled new album, commenting that they wanted \\"to finally break the silence\\". There are five finished songs and seven others still in the works. The band also explained that \\"additional lineup changes will be announced soon\\". On June 24, 2009, Jonas Bryssling confirmed on Spawn of Possession's message board that Matthew Chalk (ex-Psycroptic, Mephistopheles) and Christian Muenzner (ex-Obscura, ex-Necrophagist) have joined the band. Bryssling states \\"Two very talented and competent musicians has recently joined Spawn of Possession. Matthew Chalk (Ex-Psycroptic) is going to handle the vocal and lyric writing. Christian Muenzner (ex-Obscura, ex-Necrophagist) is going to do the Lead Guitar part and unleash his madness into the multicoloured and distorted universe of Spawn of Possession. The Line-up is now complete.\\" In the same year, Norwegian bassist Erlend Caspersen (Blood Red Throne, The Allseeing I), known for his highly technical playing, also joined the band to complete the lineup. However in September 2010, Dennis Rondum joined back and will handle the vocals instead of Chalky who just joined for a brief period. In December 2010, Richard Shill has been relieved from drumming duties. The reason cited was that Richard depends very much on actual band practice and with SoP members being scattered all over Sweden, Norway and Germany band practice becomes an impossibility. Henrik Sch√∂nstr√∂m announced as new drummer. On March 13, 2012, with three new members, Spawn of Possession released their third retail album, Incurso, which was met with very positive reactions from fans and critics alike, being their most technical and heavy record up to date. It is often being dubbed as 'one of the most influential modern death metal records, next to Necrophagist's Epitaph and Obscura's Cosmogenesis, all of which Muenzner performed on. However, most of the music was written by Jonas Bryssling with assistance of Erlend Caspersen on certain songs. On August 4, 2017 the band announced on Facebook they were breaking up, stating: Influences Spawn of Possession have been influenced by many different artists from various subgenres, mainly from death metal and classical music. They have been influenced by artists such as Death, Monstrosity, Nocturnus, Morbid Angel, Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse, Gorguts, Dismember, Edge of Sanity, and Carcass as well as art music composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Sylvius Leopold Weiss and Dmitri Shostakovich.Spawn of Possession MySpace page (retrieved 2007-07-06) Members ; Final lineup *Dennis R√∂ndum ‚àí drums (1997‚àí2006) vocals (1997‚àí2006, 2010‚àí2017) *Jonas Bryssling ‚àí guitar (1997‚Äì2017) *Christian M√ºnzner ‚àí guitar (2009‚Äì2017) *Erlend Caspersen ‚àí bass (2008‚Äì2017) *Henrik Sch√∂nstr√∂m ‚àí drums (2010‚Äì2017) ; Live musicians *Mikael Petersson - vocals (2001) *Ben Lawless - guitar (2010) *Danny Tunker ‚àí guitar (2012) ; Former *Jonas Hagstr√∂m - bass (1997-2000) *Jonas Karlsson - guitar (1997-2009) *Niklas Dewerud - bass (2000-2008) *Kelly Izquierdo - vocals (2002-2003) *Jonas Renvaktar - vocals (2003-2009) *Richard Schill - drums (2008-2010) *Matthew \\"Chalky\\" Chalk - vocals (2009-2010) ; Timeline Discography ;Studio albums * Cabinet (2003) * Noctambulant (2006) * Incurso (2012) ;Demos * The Forbidden (demo, 2000) * Church of Deviance (demo, 2001) References Swedish technical death metal musical groups Musical groups established in 1997 Musical groups disestablished in 2017 ","title":"Spawn of Possession"},{"id":"1347334","text":"Cocoroc is a rural locality in Victoria, Australia, 37 km south-west of Melbourne's central business district. Its local government area is the City of Wyndham.  History  In 1892 the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works established the Metropolitan Sewage Farm on the western bank of the Werribee River, to treat the effluent from Melbourne's new sewerage system. This area was isolated and too far from Melbourne, so a village was built to house the workers, which became the town of Cocoroc. In 1910 Cocoroc had a population of 300. It developed further in the 1920s, with the area including a public hall and three primary schools, the first one having been opened in 1894. As of 2018, the town has almost gone, the name Cocoroc encompassing the area of what is now called the Western Treatment Plant, which covers around 10,500 hectares and treats about 60% of Melbourne's sewage. In 2015, there was a temporary public art installation held at various locations across the Western Treatment Plant, this included installations held at some of the remaining structures from the former town of Cocoroc such as the old football oval and swimming pools. The installation was called Treatment featuring on- location works by six artists (Catherine Bell, Bindi Cole, Shane McGrath, Techa Noble, Megan Evans and Spiros Panigarakis), with free bus tours linking the artworks on a 90-minute journey through varied experiences including live performances, exhibitions, sensory and multimedia experiences.

In the novel  She begins the story as Miss Mina Murray, a young school mistress who is engaged to Jonathan Harker, and best friends with Lucy Westenra. She visits Lucy in Whitby on July 24 of that year, when schools would have closed for the summer. Unlike her best friend, Mina is an orphan, who never knew her father or mother.Dracula by Bram Stoker, Chapter 12. After her fianc√© Jonathan escapes from Count Dracula's castle, Mina travels to Budapest and joins him there. Mina cares for him during his recovery from his traumatic encounter with the vampire and his brides, and the two return to England as husband and wife. Back home, they learn that Lucy has died from a mysterious illness stemming from severe blood loss as the result of repeated attacks by an unknown, blood-drinking animal. The animal, they learn, was none other than Dracula taking a different shape. It is because of Mina that the party learn of the Count's plans, as she is the one who collects the journals, letters, and newspaper clippings. She assembles all of the relevant information regarding the Count, places it in chronological order, and types out multiple copies, giving them to each of the other protagonists. The end result is the epistolary novel itself. Mina and Jonathan then join the coalition around Abraham Van Helsing, and turn their attention toward destroying the Count. The party uses this information to discover clues about Dracula's plans and further investigate the locations of the various residences he purchases as a means to track him and destroy him. Each subsequent action the party takes is recorded by the various members and added to the collection of events surrounding Dracula. After Dracula learns of this plot against him, he takes revenge by visiting ‚Äî and biting ‚Äî Mina at least three times. Dracula also feeds Mina his blood, dooming her to become a vampire should she die. Afterwards, he kills Renfield and destroys all of the copies of their epistolary except for one, which Dr. Seward kept in a safe. The rest of the novel deals with the group's efforts to spare Mina a vampiric fate by tracking and attempting to kill Dracula. When Van Helsing attempts to bless her by placing a Sacred Wafer against her forehead it burns her flesh, leaving a scar, thus proving that Dracula has made her unholy. Mina slowly succumbs to the blood of the vampire that flows through her veins, switching back and forth from a state of consciousness to one of semi-trance, during which she is telepathically connected with Dracula. Mina then uses her inherent telepathic abilities to track Dracula's movements under the hypnotism of Van Helsing. Dracula later flees back to his castle in Transylvania, followed by the entire group who split up. As Van Helsing takes Mina with him on his journey to Dracula's castle to slay the brides of Dracula, the rest of the party attempt to locate and raid the ship Dracula is using, to ambush him. As time goes on, Helsing's ability to hypnotize Mina to obtain intelligence on the whereabouts of Count Dracula diminishes significantly. Her appearance and manner become more vampire-like, to the point where she even loses her appetite as well as her ability to stay awake during the day despite multiple attempts by Van Helsing to wake her. While Mina and Van Helsing are at camp, Helsing finely crumbles a sacred wafer in a circle around Mina as she sleeps during the daytime. Upon waking, she is unable to cross the circle at all. Van Helsing does this as a test; if Mina is unable to exit the circle, he reasons that vampires would be unable to enter, as well. This is confirmed when, later in the night, the brides come to the camp, but are unable to cross the ring around Mina and Van Helsing. The brides beckon her to join them but fail (which Van Helsing is relieved at when he notices Mina‚Äôs fear and disgust at them), and fly back to Dracula's castle before sunrise, where they meet their demise at Van Helsing's hands. When the party kills Dracula just before sunset, Dracula's vampiric spell is lifted and Mina is freed from the curse. The book closes with a note written seven years after these events about Mina's and Jonathan's married life and the birth of their first-born son, whom they name Quincey in remembrance of their American friend Quincey Morris, who was killed by Dracula's Szgany minions during the final confrontation. The birth of Jonathan and Mina's son signifies hope and renewal of life as the close of the novel ushers in the 20th century.Experts Milhousen and Frytopen.

In Stoker's original novel, Mina recovers from the vampire's curse upon Dracula's death and lives on with her husband, Jonathan.

This adaptation switches Mina's role, here she is killed by vampire, and makes Lucy (played by Isabelle Adjani) - who here is wife of Jonathan Harker - vampire's primary victim. *Mina was played by Jan Francis in the 1979 film Dracula directed by John Badham, in which she is Van Helsing's daughter. This adaptation also switches Mina's role and makes Lucy (played by Kate Nelligan) ‚Äî who here is the daughter of Dr. Seward ‚Äî Jonathan Harker's fianc√©e and Dracula's primary victim. *Mina was portrayed by American actress Winona Ryder in Bram Stoker's Dracula, the 1992 Francis Ford Coppola film adaptation of the book, in which she is the reincarnation of Dracula's centuries-dead wife, Elisabeta. *In Mel Brooks' parody Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995), Mina is portrayed by Amy Yasbeck. Here she is Dr. John Seward's daughter, like in 1931 film. *In the 2003 film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Mina Harker was portrayed by Peta Wilson. In a deviation from the comic the film was based on, the film has Mina remain a vampire after Dracula's death, and she keeps the surname Harker, having outlived her husband Jonathan rather than divorced him. Unlike the comic, there is no relationship between her and Allan Quatermain, but she attracts some interest from Doctor Henry Jekyll and Special Agent Tom Sawyer, and a past relationship with Dorian Gray is hinted at before he is revealed to be a double agent working for their enemy. * In 2012 vampire horror film Dracula 3D by Dario Argento Mina Harker was portrayed by Marta Gastini. In this version she comes to Dracula's castle in search of her husband Jonathan Harker and turns out to look exactly like Dracula's wife, Dolingen de Gratz, who died some centuries ago. *A woman named Mina appears at the end of Dracula Untold (2014), portrayed by Sarah Gadon. Following the film's climax, the movie (which mostly takes place in the 15th century) flashes forward to the present day, when a woman named Mina, who strongly resembles Dracula's long- dead wife Mirena, is approached by Dracula himself. After Dracula compliments Mina and recites Mirena's favourite piece of poetry, which turns out to be Mina's favourite poem as well, the movie ends with the two departing together. =Television= *In 1968 British TV film Dracula Mina Harker was played by Suzanne Neve. It's implied that she becomes a vampire by the end of the film. *In 1971 Czechoslovakian TV film Hrabƒõ Drakula Mina Harker was played by Kl√°ra Jernekov√°. It was a fairly faithful adaptation of the novel. It was the first screen adaptation to show Mina drinking Dracula's blood from the cut on his chest. *In the 1973 television film Bram Stoker's Dracula Mina is portrayed by Penelope Horner. *Blair Brown portrayed Mina Harker in the 1973 Dracula episode of the Canadian Purple Playhouse TV series. *The BBC produced a version entitled Count Dracula in 1977. Mina was played by Judi Bowker. The film was fairly faithful to Stoker's original novel, except that it portrayed Mina and Lucy as sisters. *In the 2002 Italian two-part English-language TV miniseries Dracula, Mina is portrayed by Stefania Rocca. This adaptation updates the events of the novel to the present day and takes place entirely in Budapest. Mina is the one, who kills Dracula in the end. *In 2006 a British television film entitled Dracula aired, with Stephanie Leonidas in the role of Mina Murray. She is depicted as a Roman Catholic. *Zoe Tapper portrayed Mina Harker in Demons (2009) as a half-vampire whose full powers come out when she ingests some of Dracula's blood, which still flows in her veins. Her 'default' state leaves her blind, with psychic abilities that she can use to sense the nature of the demons the main characters are presently facing. *Jessica De Gouw portrayed Mina Murray in the TV series Dracula (2013). In this role, she is a medical student who is engaged to Jonathan Harker, and is said to be a reincarnation of Dracula's deceased wife. *Olivia Llewellyn portrays Mina Murray in the TV series, Penny Dreadful (2014-2016). In this continuity she is the daughter of Sir Malcolm Murray (Timothy Dalton) and best friend of Vanessa Ives. She is transformed into a vampire by Dracula, and her father shoots her to save Vanessa Ives. *Morfydd Clark portrays Mina Murray in miniseries Dracula (2020). In this continuity she is fiancee of Jonathan Harker and visits him in the convent in Hungary after his escape from Dracula's castle. The convent is infiltrated by Dracula himself due to Harker's invitation, Dracula kills everybody, and then wears Harker's skin to get to the last survivors, Sister Agatha Van Helsing and Mina. Agatha surrendered her life in exchange for Mina, who was let go by Dracula. Later it's mentioned that Mina set foundation in the name of her perished fiance on the money from her father and Van Helsing's family. The foundation though is presented as a shady organization with undisclosed goals and operations. =Characters based on Mina= *The 2004 film Dracula 3000 features a character named Mina Murray (Alexandra Kamp), though it is a futuristic science fiction/horror film and this Mina is not intended to be the same person. *The 2006-2014 Young Dracula TV series feature character Mina Van Helsing (Jo-Anne Knowles), who is a vampire fighter and wife of Eric Van Helsing, hereditary vampire slayer. =Animation= *A character based on Mina appears in an American animated television series called Mina and the Count about a seven-year-old girl named Mina Harper (voiced by Tara Strong) and her encounters with Vlad the Count, a 700-year-old vampire (voiced by Mark Hamill). * In a 2000 anime film Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust the protagonist Vampire Hunter D sees a vision of his human mother in a room filled with blood, in which she apologizes to D for birthing him as a dhampir, and states that she couldn't help it as she was a human in love with D's vampire father. D, realizing that it's a vision conjured by his enemy Carmilla, strikes this vision of his mother down with his sword. In Vampire Hunter D's lore his mother is implied to be Mina, while his father is mentioned to be Dracula. On stage * Mina was played by Edith Craig (daughter of actress Ellen Terry) in the first stage adaptation of the novel, called Dracula, or The Un-Dead, that was written and directed by Bram Stoker himself, and performed once only at the Lyceum Theatre in London for the sole purpose of securing a stage copyright on the material in England. It took place on May 18, 1897.Mina was played by Dora Mary Patrick and Dorothy Vernon in Hamilton Deane's 1924 play in Derby and London, England. In this version the events of the novel were updated to 1920s, happen entirely in England and were turned into drawing-room mystery drama. In 1927 the play was brought to Broadway by producer Horace Liveright, who hired John L. Balderston to revise the play for American audiences. As a result of Balderston's revision, the names of female characters were swapped, and what was Stoker's Mina character became now Lucy Seward, daughter of Dr.Seward. She was played on Broadway by Dorothy Peterson. Ann Sachs played the role of Lucy Seward in the revival of the play in 1977. Lauren Thompson replaced Sachs in the role some time later before the play closed in 1980. *Mina was played by Victoria Kingsley in 1927 play by Charles Morrell. The play was commissioned by Florence Stoker, who wanted a new stage play that she could completely own, as she was dissatisfied with royalties from Deane's play. The play had large sections of verbatim dialogue from the novel and a number of Shakespearean references. It also included the scene, where Mina drank blood from Dracula's chest (which was absent from Deane's play), with Dracula saying to her \\"Come, drink of my blood, that you may become even as I\\". The play premiered in Royal Court Theatre in Warrington, England and run for a few weeks. *Mina was played by Cecilia Milone in 1991 original Argentinian production of Dracula el musical. The musical is the most popular musical in Argentina and had several revivals. *Mina was played by Melissa Errico in 2004 Broadway production of Dracula, the Musical by Frank Wildhorn. *Mina was played by Andr√©e Watters in 2006 French Canadian musical Dracula ‚Äì Entre l'amour et la mort. *Mina was played by Nathalie Fauquette in 2011 French musical Dracula, l'amour plus fort que la mort. The part was entirely dancing one. *Mina was portrayed by Abigail Prudames in 2019 Northern Ballet's production of Dracula by David Nixon. The production was recorded and showed in UK cinemas on Halloween and then broadcast on BBC4 in 2020.https://www.radiotimes.com/tv- programme/e/mck25q/dracula-by-northern-ballet--dracula-by-northern-ballet/ Music *German gothic rock darkwave band Mina Harker was named after her. *Swiss metal band Impure Wilhelmina was named after her. *She is the subject of Cradle of Filth's song \\"Lovesick for Mina\\" on their Thornography album (2006). *She is the subject of Zander Nyrond's song \\"Mina's Song\\", told from Mina's point of view after the defeat of Dracula. Japanese media In the light novels (also later adapted into two anime films and a manga series) Vampire Hunter D, the ancient vampire Count Magnus Lee refers to a \\"Mina the Fair\\" who was pursued by the \\"Sacred Ancestor\\" (revealed in the English dub of the first film to be \\"our sire Count Dracula\\"). It is implied that she may be the mother of D (the son of the Sacred Ancestor). In the 1997 manga series Hellsing, a character referred to only as \\"She\\" is eventually revealed to be Mina Harker's corpse. She died before Dracula (later Alucard) could be defeated, but because he did not die, the curse was still active in her, which the Doctor exploited to create Millennium's vampires. The 2003 video game Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow features Mina Hakuba, a childhood friend and love interest of protagonist Soma Cruz, who is later revealed to be the reincarnation of Dracula. Mina's given name and family name bear a clear resemblance to Mina Harker's name, and the relationship she shares with Soma parallels that of Dracula and Harker. Mina also appears in Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, but cannot be interacted with, only appearing in the intro and ending, though a doppelganger of Mina is killed by the main antagonist midway into the game in order to try and force Soma into becoming the new dark lord of the castle. In the 2005 manga series Dance in the Vampire Bund, the central female vampire protagonist is named \\"Mina »öepe»ô\\", a reference to Vlad »öepe»ô, one of the inspirations for Dracula. Miscellaneous * In radio drama Dracula by The Mercury Theatre on the Air, which was broadcast in 1938, Mina was played by Agnes Moorehead. In the drama Dracula refers to her as ‚Äúmy bride‚Äù and ‚Äúmy love‚Äù at one point. Mina is the one, who stakes him in the end. Dracula was played by Orsen Welles.

The Vajasaneyi Samhita-Sataphana Brahmana-Katyayana Srauta Sutra sequence of White Yajur Veda texts contains the most details. Whether actual human sacrifice was taking place has been debated since Colebrooke brought the issue under attention in 1805. He regarded it as a symbolic ritual.Parpola (2007) p. 159 Since there is no inscriptural or other record of Purushamedha ever being performed, some scholars suggest it was invented simply to round out sacrificial possibilities. Asko Parpola suggests actual human sacrifices are described in Vedic texts, while the Brahmanas show the practice diminishing. In Shatapatha Brahmana 13.6.2, an ethereal voice intervenes to halt the proceedings. The dhatupatha of A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ by PƒÅ·πáini defines the root medha as synergizing the energy to perform something fruitful.  Historical development = During the Vedic period  Scholars doubt the Purushamedha was ever performed.Oliver Leaman (2006), Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy, Routledge, , page 557, Quote: \\"It should be mentioned that although provision is made for human sacrifice (purusha-medha) this was purely symbolic and did not involve harm to anyone\\". According to Jan Houben, the actual occurrence of human sacrifice would be difficult to prove, since the relevant pieces of evidence would be small in number.  Rise of Sramanic religions  According to Jan Houben, the early Vedic period was followed by a period of embarrassment about violence in rituals. This period corresponds to the rise of Sramanic religions such as Buddhism and Jainism, both of which place emphasis on nonviolence (ahimsa). This period also corresponds to the composition of the Shatapatha Brahmana, which states that the victims of a Purushamedha are supposed to be released, and the composition of the Chandogya Upanishad, which lists nonviolence as a virtue.Chandogya Upanishad, 3.17.4  Mimamsa movement  According to Jan Houben, the Sramanic period was followed by another period where Vedic ritualists tried to defend their actions against Buddhist and Jain criticism. This period corresponds to the rise of the Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ school of philosophy, which claimed that the Vedas were the sole authority regarding matters of dharma. This movement culminated in the 7th century CE with the writings of KumƒÅrila Bha·π≠·π≠a and PrabhƒÅkara.  Medieval period  By the 10th century, the Purushamedha was included in lists of Kali-varjyas, or actions which were prohibited for the Kali Yuga. This suggests that human sacrifice had become obsolete by the time the texts were composed. However, it also suggests that the Purushamedha may have in some cases consummated with the actual sacrificing of a human. That is, the existence of inclusion of the prohibition in the list of Kali- varjyas demonstrates that at least one author seriously feared the possibility that a ritual practitioner might take the description of the ritual as a moral license to perform the rite to the extent of murder and cannibalism. This is a plausible reason to include it in the list of Kali-varjyas, even if it was a purely symbolic ceremony during the period of the composition of the ≈öatapatha BrƒÅhma·πáa. Whether or not the rite ever consummated in the slaughter of a human and the consumption of their flesh, however, remains so far a matter of scholarly speculation.  Performance in Hindu epics  The Aitareya Brahmana tells the story of a sacrifice carried out by King Harischandra. The childless king asked Varuna to provide him with a son, and in return, Varuna asks him to sacrifice the child to him. Harischandra delays the performance of the sacrifice and allows his son, named Rohita, to grow older. Eventually, Rohita wanders into the forest to find a substitute for himself. He comes across a poor Brahmin named Ajigarta, who sells his son Sunahsepa to him. Sunahsepa is bound to the stake, but he frees himself by reciting some mantras that were taught to him by Vishvamitra.Parpola (2007) pp. 161‚Äì164 This story is reproduced in the Bhagavata Purana.Bhagavata Purana, Canto 9, Chapter 7  In Vedanta and the Puranas  Human sacrifice and cannibalism are explicitly condemned in the Bhagavata Purana (5.26.31). The Chandogya Upanishad (3.16) states that the Purushamedha is actually a metaphor for life itself, and it compares the various stages of life to the oblations that are offered.  Views  Helmer Ringgren regarded that the traces of Purushameda are not clearly detectable.\\"Paths to the Divine: Ancient and Indian\\", by Vensus A. George, p. 169, Dayananda Saraswati, founder of Arya Samaj has rejected any kind of human or animal sacrifice in vaidika yag√±as. In November 2000, a modern version of Purushamedha was organised by All World Gayatri Pariwar at Shantikunj Haridwar, marking the completion of 12 year Yugsandhi Mahapurascharana. In this program, named Srijan Sankalp Vibhuti Mahayagya, participants had to tie themselves with Yup and take an oath to dedicate their life to social causes as a sacrifice. Yagya was performed on 1551 kundas on the bank of the Ganges and was attended by four million devotees.  See also  * Historical Vedic religion NotesReferencesSources=Printed sources Parpola, A.

It is considered as a crossroads between the east and west, the north and south. It is notable for its many electronic industries. Its capital is Bordj Bou Arreridj. Other localities include Bir Kasd Ali and Glela. The estimated population of Bordj Bou Arreridj is about 661,115 residents. Its location made it an important economic pole in the context of development in Algeria, as it is made up of several economic and industrial groups. Within the privatization process, and the market economy, this state has become a destination for some foreign companies in order to invest, especially in the field of electronic industries and agribusiness. Location The wilaya is located on the territory of the High Plains, riding on the mountain of Bibans; the wilaya of Bordj Bou Arreridj is geographically in eastern Algeria. Indeed, it is halfway through the route between Algiers and Constantine. The Province is located northeast of the country. It is bordered by: * East: Wilaya of S√©tif. * West: Wilaya of Bouira. * North: Wilaya of Bejaia. * South: Wilaya of M'Sila. Relief The wilaya is divided into three geographical areas which follow: * A mountainous area, with the north, the chain of Bibans. * An area of high plains constitutes most of the province. * A steppe zone, in the southwest, oriented agro-pastoral. The altitude varies between 302 m and 1885 m. Climate The province is characterized by semi-dry continental climate that offers warm temperatures in summer and very cold in winter, among the lowest in Algeria. The annual rainfall is 300 to 700 mm. It's also known by the heavy snowfall, especially in the north, leading to the interruption of the roads and the difficulty in traffic especially on the National Road No. 05. Hydrography The wilaya of Bordj Bou Arreridj has many water sources; it recorded the presence of natural spas, whose waters come with healing powers. The most known is Hammam Al Biban in the west which has been renovated, and Hamam Al Ibaynan in the north. The main rivers flowing through the wilaya are Oued Bousselam and Oued el Ksoub in the south of the wilaya. History The wilaya has experienced various civilizations. The Romans, who left numerous traces, the Hammadids, the Almohads, the Vandals, but also the Ottomans and finally the French conquered the area and eventually settled there mainly because of its fertile land. Mohamed El Mokrani, a historical figure, distinguished himself during the colonial period for having rebelled, with the support of local residents against the French presence. This revolt, known as the Mokrani Revolt, was followed by severe repression, which led to the execution and many deportations to New Caledonia, where an Algerian community still exists today, and the sequestration of the best land, delivered to European settlers. During the war of Algeria, Bordj Bou Arreridj was part of the wilaya III (Kabylie), and Bordj Ghedir, in the south of the wilaya, was the site of many battles during the war in Algeria. Population The province knows an imbalance in the distribution of populations created by the movement of people to the central high plains, one along the highways and urban centers because of natural constraints related to the nature of steppe and mountain areas in the north and south. Culture The Spring Festival is a traditional festival where every first Friday of March, the population of the wilaya go on a picnic. Families prepare foods and cakes typical of the region, with only natural ingredients: semolina, honey, butter, eggs, vegetables and dates. The wilaya of Bordj Bou Arreridj is a mosaic of Algerian traditions that combine the Kabyles, Setifians, Sahraouis and Chaouis, and a crossroads of all rural and urban traditions of the country which gave a culinary wealth to the area. Thus, the olive is celebrated on the day of spring in the mountainous areas of North and throughout Kabylie. The south is marked by the traditions of Hodna, while the east by the traditions of Setifians. Chaoui culture is present in the municipalities bordering the mountainous provinces of Batna and M'sila, in the Daira of Bordj Zemmourah, some Turkish traditions remain. Agriculture Bordj Bou Arr√©ridj is a preeminently agricultural province, the area of the Hautes Plaines being especially suitable for cereal cultivation. In the north, the mountainous area of the Bibans is dominated by tree crops, especially olive and fig trees; the area has many traditional oil mills. The southwest area is a steppe where pastoral farming is practiced extensively associated with the cultivation of cereal in fallow areas. Industry The wilaya of Bordj Bou Arreridj became a young industrial center. It is among the most dynamic wilaya of Algeria, particularly in the electronics industry and agribusiness. It was renamed by the Algerians: \\"Capital of electronics.\\" Several groups have settled national dimension as Cobra, Cristor, Star, Condor, Samsung and Nidor. Bordj Bou Arreridj is marked by its private contractors. The Algerian government encourages the development of the High Plains (Setif - Bordj Bou Arreridj) through the deployment of several major initiatives such as: construction of infrastructure such as the East-West highway and creating areas of integrated industrial activities. A new industrial area was established in the commune of El Hamadia to relieve the industrial area of the city of Bordj Bou Arreridj.

A loft apartment refers to large adaptable open space, often converted for residential use (a converted loft) from some other use, often light industrial. Adding to the confusion, some converted lofts include upper open loft areas. Loft and attic In U.S usage a loft is an upper room or story in a building, mainly in a barn, directly under the roof, used for storage (as in most private houses). In this sense it is roughly synonymous with attic, the major difference being that an attic typically constitutes an entire floor of the building, while a loft covers only a few rooms, leaving one or more sides open to the lower floor. In British usage, lofts are usually just a roof space accessed via a hatch and loft ladder, while attics tend to be rooms immediately under the roof accessed via a staircase. Lofts may have a specific purpose, e.g. an \\"organ loft\\" in a church, or to sleep in (sleeping loft). In barns a hayloft is often larger than the ground floor as it would contain a year's worth of hay. An attic or loft can often be converted to form functional living accommodation (see loft conversion). Loft apartment Warehouses converted into loft apartments in Hoxton, London, England Loft apartments are apartments that are generally built from former industrial buildings. When industrial developments are developed into condominiums instead of apartments, they may be called loft condominiums. The general term warehouse-to-loft conversions may sometimes be used for development of industrial buildings into apartments and condominiums. \\"Loft-style\\" may also refer simply to developments where a street-level business occupies the first floor while apartment \\"lofts\\" are placed above the first floor. Sometimes, loft apartments are one component of municipal urban renewal initiatives that also include renovation of industrial buildings into art galleries and studio space as well as promotion of a new part of the city as an \\"arts district\\". Originally popular with artists, they are now highly sought-after by other bohemians and hipsters, and the gentrification of the former manufacturing sectors of medium to large cities is now a familiar pattern. One such sector is Manhattan's Meatpacking District. The adoption of the Adaptive Reuse Ordinance (2001) in the City of Los Angeles (primarily the Arts District) is another example of such legislation to encourage the conversion of no longer economically viable industrial and commercial buildings to residential loft communities. Such is the demand for these spaces that real estate developers have taken to creating ready-made \\"lofts\\" in urban areas that are gentrifying or that seem primed to do so. While some of these units are created by developers during the renovation of old buildings, a number of them are included in the floor plans of brand new developments. Both types of pre-fab loft offer buyers or renters proximity to urban amenities afforded by traditional lofts, but without perceived safety risks of living in economically depressed formerly industrial areas. Industrial/hard loft Real estate industry distinguishes between two kinds of lofts. \\"Hard lofts\\" are former industrial buildings converted to residential or live/work use. Many of these conversions retain open ceilings with exposed beams, electrical wiring and HVAC ducts instead of modern suspended ceilings or sheetrock ceilings. Soft loft \\"Soft lofts\\" are loft-style residential buildings built entirely anew. They are open-concept spaces with high ceilings, large windows, brickwork and cement ceilings. Soft lofts can be warmer and have modern finishes but lack the history of hard lofts. Other lofts=Commercial loft A commercial loft refers to upper storey space, usually in a commercial or industrial building with higher ceilings; a second storey area for storage or offices above may be added within the original space used by a previous business occupant, effectively becoming a mezzanine area within the commercial loft space. Such adaptation of loft space, can result in better operating efficiencies for ongoing light industrial, commercial and work/live use. Live/work loft A Live/work loft is a residential unit located in a commercially zoned building that has either been issued a certificate of residential occupancy or meets specific criteria making it eligible for the protection of loft laws, which vary state by state. In New York State, a live/work loft must meet the following criteria: # The building was formerly used for manufacturing or commercial purposes; # The building has at least three units that were occupied residentially for 12 consecutive months during the window period from January 1, 2008 ‚Äì December 31, 2009 # The unit is at least 400SF with at least one window and can be accessed directly from a common area such as a hallway or the street; and # The unit has a certificate of occupancy (CO) or an application for Loft Law protection has been filed on or before March 14, 2014. Loft Law was designed to protect artists and other entrepreneurs working from home. To qualify for the Loft Law protection, the unit must be primarily residential with the commercial purpose being clearly incidental to the residential use; utilising no more than 49% of the total space; with no more than 3 employees; and be carried on by the actual occupant of the unit. Historically, loft residents consisted of artists and other artisans taking advantage of cheap rents, large spaces and load-bearing floors. Loft residences were illegal and loft dwellers resided under commercial leases, forgoing basic residential rights such as hot water and sanitation. To relieve their plight, many state legislatures enacted loft laws. Mould loft A long building at a shipyard with a considerable floor area on which the lines produced by a naval architect can be laid off in their full dimensions. After that the full-size drawings can be copied with the aid of wooden moulds to which, in turn, the steel frames or, in the case of wooden vessels, the hull moulds, are fashioned (see lofting). Rigging loft An elevated area or gallery in a shipyard where workers stand while fitting rigging. Parachute loft A large, open, high ceilinged space where parachute riggers re-pack parachutes into parachute containers. Sail loft A large open space used by sailmakers to make sails. The floor has to be big enough to lay out the sail as the canvas is marked and cut ready for sewing. Church architecture An organ loft in Germany Some churches have a choir loft, where the singers stand or sit during services. Sometimes the church organ is located in an organ loft, which may or may not have space for musicians apart from the organist. Churches may also contain triforiums with projecting watching-lofts. Loft conversions It is fairly common to convert all or part of a home into a loft to create an extra room in order to prevent needing to move to a new house. The most common additions are an extra bedroom or study. The attic area of a building tends to be unused, but when converted can add a large amount of floor space. Pigeon loft Pigeon loft Housing for domestic pigeons are often called pigeon lofts. Pigeon lofts consist of a large cage or aviary and sometimes a nest box. They were a traditional amenity, now usually abandoned or repurposed in the palaces of nobility and commercial buildings that predate telegraphy.

The Karmapas, Je Tsongkhapa, the Dalai Lamas, Sakya lineage heads and major Nyingma and Kagyu figures took teachings and empowerments from various schools and lineages. The movement's name is derived from two Tibetan words: Ris (bias, side) and Med (lack), which combined expresses the idea of openness to other Tibetan Buddhist traditions, as opposed to sectarianism. The Rim√© movement therefore is often misunderstood as trying to unite the various sects through their similarities. Rather Rim√© was intended to recognize the differences between traditions and appreciate them, while also establishing a dialogue which would create common ground. It is considered important that variety be preserved, and therefore Rim√© teachers are generally careful to emphasize differences in thought, giving students many options as to how to proceed in their spiritual training. Ringu Tulku describes these points which are often misrepresented: > Ris or Phyog-ris in Tibetan means \\"one-sided\\", \\"partisan\\" or \\"sectarian\\". > Med means \\"No\\".

Rim√© was initially intended to counteract the novel growing suspicion and tension building between the different traditions, which at the time had, in many places, gone so far as to forbid studying one another's scriptures. Tibetan Buddhism has a long history of vigorous debate and argumentation between schools and within one's training. This can lead a practitioner to believe that one's school has the best approach or highest philosophic view and that other lineages have a lower or flawed understanding. The Rim√© approach cautions against developing that viewpoint, while at the same time appreciating that the debate and discussion is important and that arguing which views are higher and lower is still valid discourse. Jamgon Kongtrul pointed out the necessity of each practitioner to have a strong foundation in one school: > The scholars and siddhas of the various schools make their own individual > presentations of the dharma. Each one is full of strong points and supported > by valid reasoning. If you are well grounded in the presentations of your > own tradition, then it is unnecessary to be sectarian.

Retrieved 15 September 2016. A rim√© practitioner may take empowerments from numerous lineages and living masters, though it is not a requirement to do so. Rim√©'s founders Two of the founding voices of Rim√© were Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Jamgon Kongtrul, both from different schools; the epithets Jamyang (, ) and Jamg√∂n (, ) in their name indicating that they are considered to be emanations of Manjushri. Jamg√∂n Kongtrul was from the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions, while Wangpo had been raised within the Sakya order. At the time, Tibetan schools of thought had become very isolated, and both Wangpo and Jamgon Kongtrul were instrumental in re-initiating dialogue between the sects. Rachel H. Pang has noted that non-sectarian ideals are also strongly present in the works of Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol, even though he predates the movement by about three decades and never met with any of the Rim√© masters from Kham. The Rim√© movement came to prominence at a point in Tibetan history when the religious climate had become partisan. The aim of the movement was \\"a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned.\\" Many of the teachings of various schools were close to being lost and the movement set out to preserve them. However, though the Rim√© movement gathered together teachings from each of the various traditions, it did not mix these, but recognised the individual integrity of each. The movement began within a large context of increasing domination by the Gelug school. Beginning in the 17th century, the Gelug view and politics increasingly dominated in Tibet and the minority lineages were at risk for losing their traditions.Dreyfus (2003) p.320 At its founding, the Rim√© movement primarily consisted of non-Gelugpa teachers and, at times, the movement has appeared critical of Gelug views. Georges Dreyfus suggests this argumentation was less to create further division, but was to bolster minority views that had been marginalized by Gelug supremacy. Nonetheless, philosophic commentaries by early Rim√© writers tend to criticize Gelugpa tenets. However, Rim√© was, in its idealized presentation, the re-establishment of a rule or principle that had always been present in Tibetan Buddhism, but that had been de-emphasized or forgotten: To ignorantly criticize other traditions was wrong, and that misunderstandings due to ignorance should be immediately alleviated. Ringu Tulku says: The movement became particularly well- established in the Kingdom of Derge. Rim√© has become an integral part of the Tibetan tradition, and continues to be an important philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism. Other notable Tibetan Lamas noted for their non-sectarian approach were Patrul Rinpoche and Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa, Shabkar Tsodruk Rangdrol, Dudjom Lingpa and the Khakyab Dorje, 15th Karmapa Lama, who was a student of Jamg√∂n Kongtrul. Other lineage leaders gave their blessing to the movement and its founders, who were considered extremely realized. Persecution by Phabongkha and his disciples David Kay notes that Dorje Shugden was a key element in Pabongkhapa D√©chen Nyingpo's persecution of the Rim√© movement: The Rim√© movement, primarily composed of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools, arose in the first place as a result of Gelug persecution. Present-day Rim√© movement The movement's achievements have been successful in the 20th century where taking teachings and transmissions from different schools and lineages has become the norm amongst many monastic students, lamas, yogis as well as lay practitioners. This has mainly been due to the proactive support of many lineage holders and various leaders such as the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas, the 15th and 16th Karmapas, Sakya Trizin and Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, following the \\"eclectic\\" approach of the 5th Dalai Lama \\"who blurred the lines between traditions\\": The 14th Dalai Lama composed a prayer for the movement praising various historic figures and lineages of Vajrayana Buddhism from India and Tibet, part of which says: :In short, may all the teachings of the Buddha in the Land of Snows :Flourish long into the future‚Äî the ten great pillars of the study lineage, :And the chariots of the practice lineage, such as Shij√© (‚ÄòPacifying‚Äô) and the rest, :All of them rich with their essential instructions combining sutra and mantra. :May the lives of the masters who uphold these teachings be secure and harmonious! :May the sangha preserve these teachings through their study, meditation and activity! :May the world be filled with faithful individuals intent on following these teachings! :And long may the non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha continue to flourish!Dalai Lama  Sage's Harmonious Song of Truth.

Style sheets are a form of separation of presentation and content: it creates a separate abstraction to keep the presentation isolated from the text data. Style sheets are a common feature in most popular desktop publishing and word processing programs, including Corel Ventura, Adobe InDesign, Scribus, PageMaker, QuarkXPress, WordPerfect, and Microsoft Word, though they may be referred to using slightly different terminology.  Use  Individual styles are created by the user and may include a wide variety of commands that dictate how a selected portion of text is formatted: *Typeface or font *Boldfacing *Italicizing *Underlining *Justification (left, right, center, justify, force justify) *Space before and after paragraphs *Tab stops and indentation *Type size *Leading *Kerning *Tracking *Color *Borders or strokes *Superscript or subscript *Dropcaps *Letter case *Strike through *Outline font style *Hyphenation In most programs with style sheets, there is a window or menu listing the style sheets the user has associated with the document. For example, a newspaper may have a style sheet for its story text called \\"Body copy\\" that sets the type at 10 point Nimrod with 11 point leading and justified alignment. Most programs allow users to name their own styles. Usually easy-to-remember names are used that describe what the style is used for. Common names might include \\"headline,\\" \\"subhead\\" and \\"byline.\\" To apply a style to a portion of text, most programs allow users to select the text with their mouse and then click on the desired style in a style panel. Some programs split style sheets into two classes: paragraph and character. Paragraph style sheets are applied to an entire paragraph while character styles are applied to only a select number of characters. Character styles are useful when a user needs to format only a small portion of a paragraph. For example, a newspaper may publish lists of current movies by starting with the name of a movie in a bold, sans serif typeface. Then, without starting a new paragraph, the review starts in the standard story text format. In this case, the designer could highlight the movie title and select the appropriate character style to apply the formatting only to the title. The rest of the paragraph can then be styled independently. More advanced layout programs allow users to format more complex paragraphs with a single paragraph style. Using our movie review example above, say the newspaper always places a colon after the movie title and runs 10 short movie reviews as one large story. In this case, the style could be programmed to apply the bold, sans serif typeface at the start of a new paragraph until it encounters a colon. After the colon, the style switches to the standard story text style. Therefore, the designer could highlight the entire collection and apply only one style that will automatically format the entire story without having to go through and apply separate character styles to each of the 10 reviews. Some scorewriters, including MuseScore and Sibelius, implement style sheets to control the appearance and layout of sheet music.  Benefits  Style sheets help publications maintain consistency, so common elements such as story text, headlines and bylines always appear the same. Style sheets also help save time allowing a designer to click once rather than having to apply each element one at a time and risk using an incorrect value. Finally, style sheets are also useful if a publication decides to make changes to a design - say, make the story text slightly smaller. A user with proper administrative access can make the change to the master style sheet and then \\"send\\" the revised style sheets to all users, so the change is automatically reflected.

The rich and creamy drink has a smooth, custard- like consistency. The typical alcohol content is generally between 14% and 20% ABV. Its contents may be a blend of egg yolks, aromatic spirits, sugar or honey, brandy, vanilla, and sometimes cream (or evaporated milk). Notable makers of advocaat include Bols, Darna Ovo Liker, DeKuyper (in two varieties), and Verpoorten. Etymology Two theories have been put out on the origins of \\"advocaat\\". According to several makers, such as Verpoorten and Bols, and the Oxford companion to Sugar and Sweets, its origins can be traced back to \\"abacate\\", an alcoholic beverage of the indigenous people in Brazil, which was made with avocado. Dutch colonials of northern Brazil introduced this beverage to Europe as \\"advocat/advocaat\\". As avocados could not grow in northern Europe, they were replaced with egg yolk, thought to have a similar taste and consistency, and the name derived from the avocado stuck, although the drink no longer contains any. Advocaat is also the Dutch word for \\"lawyer\\". As the name of the drink, it is short for advocatenborrel, or \\"lawyer's drink\\", where borrel is Dutch for a small alcoholic beverage consumed slowly during a social gathering. According to the 1882 edition of the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal (Dictionary of the Dutch Language), it is \\"zoo genoemd als een goed smeersel voor de keel, en dus bijzonder dienstig geacht voor een advocaat, die in 't openbaar het woord moet voeren\\" (\\"so named as a good lubricant for the throat, and thus considered especially useful for a lawyer, who must speak in public\\"). Types and uses A bottle of advocaat of German origin Jars and wide mouth bottles of thick advocaat are sold mainly in the Netherlands and Belgium, though may be available in Germany and Austria. Further exports are of a more liquid version. In particular the original thick variety, i.e. without albumen, is used as a waffle, pancake or poffertjes topping, as an ingredient for ice cream, custards, pastries and similar desserts, or as an ap√©ritif or digestif. The latter, possibly topped with whipped cream and then occasionally sprinkled with a touch of cocoa powder, is served in a very tiny bowl or small glass from which it is eaten by use of a teaspoon. In Belgian restaurants and taverns, it may be a complementary accompaniment to a coffee. In the export variety both parts of the eggs are used. The best known cocktail using advocaat is the Snowball: a mixture of advocaat, sparkling lemonade and sometimes (although this is not required) lime juice that is often consumed at Christmastime. Another is the Fluffy duck, made with rum. Another advocaat- based beverage is the Bombardino, a drink commonly found in Italian ski resorts, particularly the Italian Alps, made by mixing advocaat, brandy, and whipped cream. Related drinks The Polish equivalent, ajerkoniak (de: Eier‚Äîeggs; fr: Cognac), is based on vodka instead of brandy, despite what the name may suggest.

The tarmac-surfaced road, which is the most direct route from the central Lake District to West Cumbria, shares the title of steepest road in England with Rosedale Chimney Bank in North Yorkshire. It has a maximum gradient of 1 in 3 (about 33%). Etymology The pass takes its name from Hard Knott which is derived from the Old Norse harthr (hard) and knutr (craggy hill). Geography A road sign warning drivers about the extreme gradient. A single track road runs between Eskdale in the west to the edge of the neighbouring Wrynose Pass in the east. On the western side is Harter Fell and the remains of Hardknott Roman Fort ( above sea level). The Hardknott Pass stands at a maximum elevation of . The Isle of Man in the Irish Sea can be seen on clear days. The road descends steeply at a gradient of 30% (1 in 3) into the Duddon Valley. At the eastern end of the pass is Cockley Beck farm, built in the 1860s and owned by the National Trust. The route from Hardknott leads eastward towards the Wrynose Pass and Ambleside. The pass is described as one of the most challenging roads in Britain. A series of hairpin bends make visibility difficult in various places. Traffic ascending the pass has priority as advised by the Highway Code. The pass is often closed in winter due to ice that makes the route impassable for vehicles. The challenging 1 in 3 gradients make the route popular with cyclists. It is part of the annual Fred Whitton Challenge, a 112-mile ride around the Lake District. History A road over the pass was built by the Romans around AD 110 to link the coastal fort and baths at Ravenglass with their garrisons at Ambleside and Kendal. The Romans called this road the Tenth Highway. The road fell into disrepair after the Romans left Britain in the early 5th century, although it remained as an unpaved packhorse route thereafter. The road was originally used entirely for military traffic, but following the Romans' retreat from Britain was used to transport lead and agricultural goods. By the early Middle Ages, the road was known as the Waingate (\\"cart road\\") or Wainscarth (\\"cart pass\\"): there is an 1138 record of a party of monks traversing it in an oxcart.The Countryman, v.51-52 (1950), 309 Hardknott pass and its surrounding area fell within the domain of the Lords of Millom, being situated between the headwaters of the Esk and Duddon. Grazing and hunting rights were given to the monks of Furness Abbey by the Lords of Millom in the 13th century, which they held until the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536-41). In the 1880s an association of hoteliers, the English Lake District Association, financed improvements to the road in the hope of encouraging tourist excursions by carriage; by 1891 the scheme was judged to be \\"not the success that was anticipated\\".Marshall and Walton, The Lake Counties from 1830 to the Mid-twentieth Century, 1981, p.195 Nevertheless, the route had some popularity with cyclists and early motorists, with the Cyclists' Touring Club 1911 Guide to North-West England describing the old coach road as \\"difficult going West, cruel coming East\\".CTC Guide, 1911, p.116 The first motor vehicles were taken over the Hardknott and Wrynose passes, from the Eskdale side, in 1913.\\"Over the worst hills in England\\", Autocar, 12 July 1913, 49-53 In 1936, the Cumberland Highways Committee considered, and rejected, a proposal to make the pass more accessible to motors by laying down a new road surface and making other improvements. However, during the Second World War the War Office used the area for tank training completely destroying the existing road surface. After the war the wartime damage was repaired and tarmaced. A decade after the local government had rejected opening the highway to vehicles, the war's legacy had inadvertently created a direct motor route between Ambleside and Eskdale for the first time. The courses of the Roman and modern roads are not identical. The Roman highway ‚Äì on the western side ‚Äì is to the north of the modern road and to the south on the eastern side of the pass.

Brunner was a prominent Freemason, and a generous benefactor to the towns in his constituency and to the University of Liverpool. He is the great grandfather of the Duchess of Kent. Early life and career John Tomlinson Brunner was born in Everton, Liverpool, the fourth child and second son of John Brunner (b. 20 June 1800), a Swiss Unitarian and schoolmaster, and Margaret Catherine Curphey (d. 8 September 1847), who originated from the Isle of Man, daughter of Thomas Curphey and wife Margaret Leece. His father established a school in Netherfield Road, Everton, known as St George's House, to teach children along the lines advocated by Pestalozzi. Brunner's mother died in 1847, when he was aged five; his father married Nancy Inman in 1851. She had a shrewd business sense and Brunner gave credit to her for teaching him skills in practical matters. Brunner was educated at his father's school and then, at the age of 15, he decided to follow a career in commerce. () He spent four years in a shipping house in Liverpool, but found it neither exciting nor lucrative, and so decided on a change of career. In 1861, Brunner took a clerical post at Hutchinson's alkali works in Widnes, where his older brother Henry was already working as technical manager. There, he rose to the position of general manager. Shortly after starting work at Hutchinson's, Brunner met the German-born chemist Ludwig Mond. Brunner Mond and Company In 1873 Brunner formed a partnership with Mond and together they founded Brunner Mond & Company. Their initial capital was less than ¬£20,000 (¬£ in ), most of which was borrowed. In April 1872 Mond had been to Belgium to meet Ernest Solvay to negotiate terms to manufacture alkali by the process Solvay had developed. The Solvay process produced soda ash more cheaply than the established Leblanc process, from raw materials which were more easily obtainable, and produced fewer waste products. Mond made a gentlemen's agreement with Solvay to apportion the global markets, with Mond's company having exclusive rights to the United States and to the British Isles. Brunner and Mond decided to build their factory at Winnington, near Northwich, Cheshire on land owned by Lord Stanley of Alderley. This was sited on the River Weaver which allowed for the transport of the raw materials and finished products to and from the works. Lord Stanley insisted on selling the house, Winnington Hall, as well as the surrounding land, as part of the deal. The purchase was completed in 1873, and for a time both Mond and Brunner lived separately in the wings of the hall.. The early years were extremely difficult, initially in getting the plant to work efficiently and then in selling the soda ash. It was not until 1878 that success was achieved when they outsold their competitors and were producing their products more cheaply.. In 1881, the partnership was converted into a limited company with capital assets listed at ¬£600,000 (¬£ in ) and the founders became managing directors for life. In 1891, Brunner became the chairman and retained that position until April 1918, 14 months before his death. However, by then his duties were being increasingly performed by his son, Roscoe. After its slow start, Brunner Mond & Company became the wealthiest British chemical company of the late 19th century. On its merger with three other British chemical companies to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in 1926, it had a market capitalization of over ¬£18 million (¬£ in ). Brunner's sobriquet, \\"Chemical Croesus\\", was given to him by The Times. He was a paternalistic employer and went to great lengths to improve the situation of his employees. Measures introduced by Brunner and Mond were shorter working hours, sickness and injury insurance, and holidays with pay. Politics Statue of John Brunner in Winnington, Cheshire During the years he was working at Hutchinson's in Widnes, Brunner was developing his political interests. He joined the Widnes chapter of the National Education League and became its secretary in 1872. This gave him the opportunity to come into contact with Liberals from Liverpool and other parts of the country. Soon after moving to Northwich Brunner became more practically involved with education locally, in particular with the British School in the town. He later served on its board of governors and also on the local sanitary authority. As a result of the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 the parliamentary constituency of Northwich was created and Brunner offered himself as a candidate for the Liberal Party. In his speech for the position he expressed support for the disestablishment of the Church of England, for reform of property laws, for Irish Home Rule and for compensation for those whose properties had been damaged by the pumping of brine from the salt mines in the area. During the campaign he was heckled because he had a foreign-sounding name. He responded \\"My father was a Swiss, my mother was a Manx woman, I was born in Liverpool, my nurse was Welsh: is that Cheshire enough for you?\\" At the general election on 1 December 1885 Brunner beat William Henry Verdin, his Conservative rival, with a majority of 1,028. The Liberal Party won more seats than any other party in the election, but insufficient to form a majority government, leaving the Irish Parliamentary Party holding the balance of power. It proved impossible to form a stable government, and so another general election was called in June 1886. In the meantime, the Liberal Party had split, and the Liberal Unionist Party had been formed. Brunner's opponent at the 1886 election was William Henry Verdin's brother, Robert, standing as a Liberal Unionist. The election was held on 13 July 1886, and Brunner was defeated by 458 votes. In November 1886, Brunner embarked on a world tour, accompanied by his wife and his son Stephen. His return to Northwich on 2 July 1887 was greeted with great celebration, as he was extremely popular in the town, regarded as a kind and sympathetic employer and a generous benefactor. Within three weeks of Brunner's return, Robert Verdin died and a by-election was called. Brunner's opponent was Lord Henry Grosvenor, who was standing as a Liberal Unionist. This time, at the election on 13 August, Brunner won with a majority of 1,129. After the 1889 Armagh rail disaster, Brunner opposed moves to regulate safety on railways, saying during a debate on 2 August that safety should be left in the hands of \\"those who understand these matters best\\", i.e. the railway companies. But the government moved rapidly to have railway operations and safety supervised by the Board of Trade. At the 1892 general election, Brunner's opponent was not a Liberal Unionist, but a Conservative, George Whiteley, who was a cotton manufacturer from Blackburn. Brunner was returned with an increased majority of 1,255. In the 1895 election he beat Thomas Ward, another Conservative, by 1,638 votes. The 1900 general election was held during the Boer War, to which Brunner was opposed. He retained his seat, but with a reduced majority of 699. In the 1906 general election, Brunner's opponent was the Conservative Colonel B.N. North who had fought in the Boer War. Brunner increased his majority to 1,792. He continued to be the Member of Parliament for Northwich until the general election in January 1910, when he decided not to stand again, partly because of his own health and also because of concern for his wife's health. Subsequently, he moved to Surrey, but continued to play a part in politics when he was elected to the Chertsey division of Surrey County Council. As a Liberal MP he supported Irish Home Rule, trade unions, free trade and welfare reforms. Leading up to the First World War he argued that Britain should adopt a more sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in the opinion that it should be fought and won. In addition to the production of alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene. Benefactions Brunner was a generous benefactor whose gifts included the provision of schools, guildhalls and social clubs. In Northwich he provided a free library and re-endowed Sir John Deane's Grammar School. In Runcorn he purchased a disused chapel and presented it to the town to be used by the trades unions and the Friendly Societies, and in nearby Weston village he bought a disused school and gave it to the local community to serve as its village hall. He also endowed the chairs of economics, physical chemistry and Egyptology (the Brunner Professorships) at the University of Liverpool. Abroad he gave gifts to the Landesmuseum in Z√ºrich and provided a hospital, also in Switzerland. In 1885 he became a Freemason and in 1900 founded the John Brunner Lodge at Over Winsford. The following year he was honoured with the brevet rank of Past Grand Deacon of England. In 1899 Brunner (who had by then been created a baronet) became chairman of the Runcorn and Widnes Transporter Bridge Company. He subscribed ¬£25,000 (¬£ in ) towards its construction plus a loan of ¬£12,000 (¬£ in ) together with a personal guarantee on a bank loan of ¬£31,000 (¬£ in ). When the building of the bridge was complete in 1905 it was due to be opened by Edward VII, but the king was unable to attend, and so Brunner performed the ceremony himself. By 1911 it had become apparent that the bridge would always operate at a loss, and Brunner assigned his interest in it to Widnes Corporation. The Times stated that this action amounted to a \\"virtual gift of ¬£68,000\\" (¬£ in ). Personal life Brunner believed that his success owed much to the \\"courage and independence of thought\\" that he derived from his Unitarian faith and recalled the influence of visits to Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel with his father as a child. On 14 June 1864 Brunner married Salome Davies, the daughter of a Liverpool merchant with whom he had six children. Salome died on 29 January 1874 and the following year he married Jane Wyman, the daughter of a Kettering physician and the governess to his children. From this marriage three more children, all daughters, were born. On 8th September 1890 his oldest son, John, got into difficulties whilst swimming in Lake Como, Italy. He was rescued by his younger sibling, Sidney Herbert Brunner, who lost his life in the process. Sidney's body was found on 10th September and buried in Bellagio, beside the lake, the next day. https://www.ancestrylibraryedition.co.uk/boards/surnames.brunner/644 In 1891 the Brunners moved from Winnington Hall to Wavertree, a suburb of Liverpool. Amongst other offices held, he was Vice-President of the British Science Guild, Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Lancashire (from 1904) and Pro- Chancellor of the University of Liverpool. In 1909 the University of Liverpool awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. In 1895 he was made the Baronet of Druids Cross in the County of Lancashire and in 1906 he became a member of the privy council, but he declined offers of a peerage. He died in 1919 at his home in Chertsey, Surrey. His estate amounted to over ¬£906,000 (¬£ in ). In addition, he had given generously to his five married daughters, and had transferred investments to his sons. The baronetcy passed to his eldest son, John Fowler Leece Brunner. His descendants include, through his elder son's daughter (Joyce Worsley, Lady Worsley, n√©e Brunner), Katharine, Duchess of Kent (born 1933), married since 1961 to a grandson of Britain's King George V, and Shelagh Brunner (1902-1983), daughter of his younger son (Harold Roscoe Brunner), who morganatically married Prince Ferdinand of Liechtenstein (1901-1981) in 1925, a member of that principality's still reigning dynasty.Massingberd, pp.311, 381.

The brand was originally created by bartender Martin Wilkes Heron in New Orleans in 1874, and originally used whiskey as the base spirit. Since March 1, 2016, the brand has been owned by the Sazerac Company, which purchased it from Brown‚ÄìForman.  History  Woodland Plantation. The label was redesigned in 2010.\\"Before & After: Southern Comfort Rebranding\\", The Dieline, May 19, 2010. Southern Comfort was first produced by bartender Martin Wilkes Heron (1850‚Äì1920), the son of a boat-builder, in 1874 at McCauley's Tavern in the Lower Garden District, two miles north of the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. According to the New Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau, McCauley's Tavern was \\"just off Bourbon Street\\", and the original form of the drink was called Cuffs and Buttons. Heron moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1889, patented his creation, and began selling it in sealed bottles with the slogan \\"None Genuine But Mine\\" and \\"Two per customer. No Gentleman would ask for more.\\" Southern Comfort won the gold medal at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. In an episode of The Thirsty Traveler entitled \\"A River of Whiskey\\", spirits historian Chris Morris describes the original recipe of Southern Comfort. Heron began with good-quality bourbon and would add: > An inch of vanilla bean, about a quarter of a lemon, half of a cinnamon > stick, four cloves, a few cherries, and an orange bit or two. He would let > this soak for days. And right when he was ready to finish, he would add his > sweetener: he liked to use honey. The original brand closed during Prohibition and was reopened afterward by Francis Fowler. Between the 1930s and 2010, the image on the label of Southern Comfort was A Home on the Mississippi, a rendering by Alfred Waud depicting Woodland Plantation, an antebellum mansion in West Pointe √† la Hache, Louisiana, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and now provides bed-and-breakfast accommodation. In 2010 the plantation artwork was dropped from the label. Brown‚ÄìForman purchased the brand in 1979. In 2011, the brand began releasing flavored variations like cherry, lime, gingerbread, and Tabasco. In January 2016 Brown‚ÄìForman sold it to Sazerac Company, along with Tuaca, as part of a $543.5 million deal. Sazerac announced that Southern Comfort's formula would be changed in 2017 to restore whiskey as the base spirit, as the original formula used. Sometime before Brown‚ÄìForman purchased the brand, it had been reformulated to use neutral spirit, with only a negligible amount of whiskey as a flavorant. Janis Joplin was known to drink Southern Comfort to excess.  Varieties  In the United States, Southern Comfort is available as 42 US proof (21% ABV), 70 US proof (35% ABV), 80 US proof (40% ABV), and 100 US proof (50% ABV). Varieties including additional flavorings, such as lime and caramel, were introduced by Brown‚ÄìForman in the latter years of their ownership. These were discontinued by Sazerac.  Eggnog products  Also seasonally available through various retailers is Southern Comfort-branded eggnog. These currently include two variations of eggnog flavors, Traditional and Vanilla Spice. The Traditional flavor is usually available in one quart and half gallon sizes. These eggnog products contain no alcohol.Mason, A. (2016, December 20).

In cocktails  Southern Comfort is used in the creation of numerous cocktails, including the Alabama Slammer. One of the earliest Southern Comfort-based cocktails to be marketed was the Scarlett O'Hara, named after the character and concocted in tribute to the release of the film adaptation of Gone with the Wind in 1939. The mixture includes Southern Comfort, cranberry juice, and fresh lime.

Wasdale Head claims to be home of the highest mountain (Scafell Pike), deepest lake (Wastwater), smallest church and biggest liar in England. The last of these claims refers to Will Ritson, who paradoxically proclaimed himself as such. Topology It is located at the head of the valley of Wasdale, and is surrounded by some of England's highest mountains: Scafell Pike, Sca Fell, Great Gable, Kirk Fell and Pillar. Climbing and walking The hamlet was the centre of the early years of British rock climbing. There is a famous climber's hotel here, the Wasdale Head Inn, made popular in the Victorian period by Walter Parry Haskett Smith , Owen Glynne Jones and many other pioneers. Wasdale Head is a popular starting point for the ascent of Scafell Pike. On summer weekends, crowds of people can be found attempting this steep but straightforward walk. Today, it is the recognised starting point for the ascent of Scafell Pike as part of the National Three Peaks Challenge, a vehicle-supported walk of the highest peaks of England, Scotland and Wales. Church In the hamlet is St Olaf's Church, which is claimed as being the smallest church in England. The church has long been associated with British climbers. The south window has a small pane within it with an etching of Napes Needle on Great Gable, serving as a memorial to members of the Fell & Rock Climbing Club who lost their lives in the First World War. Will Ritson Will Ritson (1808‚Äì1890) BBC retrieved 14 July 2018 was a landlord of the Wastwater Hotel (now called the Wasdale Head Inn) in Wasdale, and he told grand fables. One, for example, was about a wounded eagle he found near the inn. He kept it in his chicken coop and nursed it back to health. One night the coop was raided by a bitch hound. The eagle was unscathed, but five months later the dog gave birth to a litter of winged hounds. The World's Biggest Liar competition is held annually in his memory.

The AD is sold under a different name when manufactured as a passenger car, called the Nissan Wingroad. It is an alternative to the Honda Partner commercial delivery van in Japan.  VB11 series In October 1982, the AD Van supplemented (and also gradually replaced) the commercial delivery vans based on Nissan's other vehicles. In 1983, the Nissan Cedric van was discontinued, as was the Nissan Gloria van. It originally came with four front doors and a liftback hatch in back. In July 1983 a two-door version was introduced, meaning that the earlier B310 Sunny Van could finally be retired. The AD range was based on the B11 series Nissan Sunny wagon but has a more square-rigged and utilitarian appearance. This wagon was sold in Japan as the Sunny AD Van at Nissan Satio Store and as the Pulsar AD Van at Nissan Cherry Store. It was also sold as the \\"Nissan Datsun AD Van\\", to tie it together with the Nissan Datsun, which was the name used for the Nissan Pickup in the Japanese Domestic Market. It came with three engines; the 1.3 and 1.5-litre carburetted E13S and E15S and the 1.7-litre CD17 diesel engine. The transmissions were either a four- or five-speed manual transmission, with the availability of a three-speed automatic for the bigger of the gasoline options.

Low cost, light weight, and a flat, low loading floor were the main consideration. The AD van was designed for very basic duties, and the options list was kept small to enhance economical use and running costs. The AD van used a front wheel drive engine configuration shared with the Sunny. The AD Van was marketed as the Nissan Sunny in some European markets such as Belgium (glazed five-door), beginning with the 1984 model year. In the Netherlands this version was sold as a \\"Stationwagen\\" as well as a van, both with the 1.3-liter engine. The United Kingdom received three three-door panel van version with the 1.3-litre E13 engine and . Payload is . The AD van remained basically unchanged, except for minor cosmetic changes until the second generation was introduced in 1990 with the Y10 series. The three-door van was also available as a strict two-seater. Nissan Australia sold the VB11 three-door panel van as part of the Nissan Pulsar range between September 1983 and December 1985, replacing the Sunny (B310) panel van that had been discontinued earlier in 1983. The Pulsar panel van was fitted with the 1.3-liter E13 engine and a four-speed manual transmission. The Pulsar van weighed and had a payload rating of . Y10/N14 series The second-generation AD Van (sold as the Y10/N14 Wagon in Europe), introduced in October 1990, replaced the Nissan Sunny B13 series wagon, but with a different rear end compared to exported standard Sunny wagons. The vehicle continued as the AD Van, and as a private use (non-commercial) it was marketed as the Nissan Sunny California wagon (N14/Y10). The engines used were the 1.5 L and 1.3 L GA15DS & GA13DS with DOHC and the 1.7 L CD17 diesel continued. The Wingroad/AD Van were also accompanied by a larger retail/commercial station wagon/delivery van called the Nissan Avenir/Expert that replaced the Nissan Bluebird U12 wagon/delivery van. In 1996 Nissan added the Nissan Wingroad to the lineup. The Wingroad was offered with the SR20DE as well as the SR18DE and GA15DE, while the smallest 1.3 and the diesel option were not available. Trying to cash in on Japan's RV (\\"recreational vehicle\\", usually versions of existing vans and wagons combining a slight off-road vibe with sporty equipment) craze of the late 1990s. The Wingroad followed this recipe closely, being a winged and despoilered version of the AD Van, usually with more powerful engines. Four- wheel drive was optional. Unusually, the Wingroad also received a redesigned, larger rear end with a longer rear overhang. The Wingroad name originated as a trim level on the Bluebird U11-series wagon. April 1992 saw the introduction of the AD Max with an unusual raised cargo bay, called fourgonnette style, with two French doors in back and two doors for front passengers. The wheelbase was extended by to , with the height of the cargo area measured to be . Overall length also increased to Two rear wipers were installed on each of the French doors. Suzuki also tried this approach with the Suzuki Alto Hustle. The AD Max was available with regular rectangular side windows or a more unusual triangular arrangement (pictured), as well as a panelled version of the latter. Mazda Familia Wagon Y10 August 1993 saw minor changes, with the 1.3 L automatic transmission upgraded to a four-speed. The Wingroad transmission selections were either the four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual. The Wingroad JS trim level shares an appearance with the larger Nissan Avenir Blastar, and both also use a two-tone paint scheme. August 1994, the AD van was sold as the Subaru Leone sold as a light commercial vehicle until model year 2001 Y11 series for Subaru. The Subaru version was added as a result of the Leone platform having been replaced by the Subaru Impreza which had a reduced size cargo area on the wagon/five-door hatchback. The AD-based Mazda Familia Wagon/Van was introduced at the same time and remained until the Y12 series. April 1996 saw a driver-side airbag added as an extra-cost option. May 1997 saw minor cosmetic changes. The 1.3 and 1.5-liter GA13DE and GA15DE engines replaced the GA13DS and GA15DS versions for better emissions performance. the 2.0 L CD20 diesel engine was introduced with the ATTESA 4WD system, and ventilated front disc-brakes were introduced on all trim levels. The front windshield wipers were offered with a de-icer option. The Y10 platform was introduced to Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia in September 1993 as the Nissan AD Resort. A pickup truck body version was available in Thailand as AD \\"Wingroad\\" (which was different from the Japanese-market Wingroad version). The Y10 was also built in Thailand under license as the Nissan NV. This was built on the longer wheelbase of the AD Max in a bewildering array of bodystyles to suit the Thai buyers' penchant for pickup trucks, including a double-cab ute. There was also a wagon version based on the pickup, essentially going full circle from the original AD Wagon. Thai cars mostly received the GA16DS engine with . In Mexico, only the station wagon body of the Y10 AD was marketed between 1993 and 2001, being named Nissan Tsubame (a Japanese term which refers the woodswallow bird species, and also the name of a city in Niigata, Japan). This model was introduced in 1993 as a local companion for the then recently launched B13-series saloon range (Sunny/Sentra, designated \\"Nissan Tsuru\\" in the Mexican market) as there was no B13-based wagon, unlike the former B12 and B11 platforms. The Tsubame range featured two trim levels: GS and GST. Y11 series The third series AD (Y11) began in May 1999, once again available only with a station wagon body, sold in the Japanese, New Zealand (badged as Pulsar) and Caribbean markets. It is mechanically related to the Nissan Sunny B15 series but has a different exterior design. The interior design is shared with the Japanese market Nissan Sunny B15 as well. The second generation Wingroad received a facelift in October 2001, with a sleeker front end and a new interior. The Wingroad version slotted in Nissan's product range between the Nissan Bluebird and the Primera, available with the 1.5 L QG15DE, the 1.8 L QG18DE and the 2.0 L SR20VE engines. The 1.8 L exists only as a 4WD version. The Wingroad shares a MacPherson strut front suspension with the other Nissan C-Segment cars of the era, such as the B15 Sunny/Sentra and the N16 Almera/Pulsar. In most models, the rear suspension consisted of a beam axle with coil springs and panhard rod. The four-wheel drive versions and the ZV-S FWD variant used a multi-link rear suspension. All variants were fitted with ventilated disc brakes in the front and drum brakes in the rear; the exception being the ZV-S which was fitted with non-ventilated disc brakes in the rear. From October 2000, the Wingroad was offered as a trim level called \\"G Extra\\" that included an optional TV screen that folded down from the ceiling for rear passengers. In March 2001, manufacturing operations were moved from the Nissan Shatai factory in Kyoto to the facility in Shonan. The 2.0 L SR20VE engine is replaced with the 2.0 L QR20DE. Various trim level packages were introduced on the Wingroad approximately every six months, including aero packages and limited offering names, such as \\"Aero Sport Limited\\". The commercial AD Van version continued to be also sold as the Mazda Familia wagon. It is unrelated to the Familia passenger car range, and kept the Familia name after the car range was replaced by the Mazda3. Engines available for the AD Van were the 2.2 L YD22 diesel, 1.3 L QG13DE, the 1.5 L QG15DE, and the 1.8 L QG18DE (with dedicated 4WD) that was upgraded to the QG18DEN designed to run on CNG for emissions reduction on January 14, 2000. The CNG option achieved 1000 sales by July 24, 2002, however, CNG vehicles were no longer offered by December 3, 2008. The diesel engine was discontinued in 2001 as Japan actively discouraged the use of diesel vehicles within its cities. A driver-side airbag is now standard on both the AD van and the Wingroad, with a passenger-side airbag optional. The AD Van Max was no longer offered.  NY12 series  An all-new AD Van (Y12) debuted December 20, 2006, now using the Renault-Nissan B-platform. AD/Wingroad Y12 is almost the same car as the European/Japanese 2005-2013 Nissan Note E11 hatchback and Nissan Livina station wagon (Asia). Models fully share body (except for the E11's shorter rear), engines, transmission, suspension, etcetera, while differing superficially in design. Parts are compatible depending on the initial market. The Wingroad debuted November 14, 2005, with a preview at the 39th Tokyo Motor Show in October. Like the Tiida/Versa, it has a wheelbase of 2600 mm, and the new HR15DE and MR18DE engines along with the CR12DE. While the Wingroad was available with 4WD from the beginning, the AD Vans originally only came with front-wheel drive. The transmission for the AD van and the Wingroad is a four-speed automatic or the optional CVT. From 2007, there is also a new Familia Cargo, based on the Y12 shape AD Van. The Y12 was introduced in late December 2008 as the Mitsubishi Lancer Cargo (). The Wingroad received limited edition trim level packages, called \\"Rider Œ± II\\", \\"Sport Acapello\\", \\"V Selection\\" to name a few. When the Nissan Stagea was discontinued June 2007, the Wingroad/AD van was the only station wagon still built by Nissan, with Nissan instead introducing a number of new MPV's, such as the Nissan Lafesta, the Nissan Presage, and the Nissan Elgrand. In December 2008, the AD Van is now available with the HR16DE engine and the e4WD all wheel drive system. In the same month, the last of the preceding Y11 series were finally taken out of production; CNG and 4WD versions of the Y11 had been built in parallel for a few years after the Y12 was introduced. Intelligent Key was added to the Wingroad September 11, 2006, and the Wingroad can be equipped with a GPS navigation package using HDD technology. The AD Van had been sold without passenger side airbag, but from May 2009 this became standard across the range. The AD Van received its facelift on November 30, 2016 and renamed the NV150 AD. The Wingroad was discontinued on March 24, 2018.

Huene was born in T√ºbingen, Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. His discoveries include the skeletons of more than 35 individuals of Plateosaurus in the famous Trossingen quarry, the early proto-dinosaur Saltopus in 1910, Proceratosaurus in 1926, the giant Antarctosaurus in 1929, and numerous other dinosaurs and fossilized animals like pterosaurs. He also was the first to naming several higher taxa, including Prosauropoda and Sauropodomorpha. He visited the Geopark of Paleorrota in 1928, and there collected the Prestosuchus chiniquensis in 1938. He also studied several Permo-Carboniferous and Triassic limbed vertebrates, including members of several large clades, such as Temnospondyli, Synapsida, and Sauropsida. In his work on mesosaurs, Huene indicated that a lower temporal fenestra was present (as in synapsids), an interpretation later rejected by many subsequent workers, but more recently upheld. A new species of basal sauropodomorph, Lufengosaurus huenei, was named after von Huene in 1941.

A three-time All American at the University of Oklahoma,\\"Tulsan Wayman Tisdale dies\\", Tulsa World, May 15, 2009. he was elected to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009.\\"College Hall of Famer Tisdale dies at 44\\", ESPN.com, May 16, 2009. Early life Tisdale was born in Fort Worth, Texas. His father, Louis Tisdale, was a well- known pastor in Tulsa, Oklahoma, serving for 21 years as senior pastor of Friendship Church;\\"Rev. Tisdale Dies Of Heart Attack\\", Tulsa World, March 29, 1997. After his father died in 1997, the former Osage Expressway in Tulsa was named L. L. Tisdale Parkway in his honor.Curtis Killman,\\"Mayor Unveils New Tisdale Parkway\\", Tulsa World, June 10, 1997. Wayman's older brother Weldon has been pastor of the church since 1997.\\"Our Pastor\\" at Friendship Church official website (retrieved May 18, 2009). Growing up, Tisdale was not interested in basketball. When older brothers Weldon and William played pickup games he usually quit before they finished, retreating to the family's sandbox. However, Tisdale began taking to the sport in the eighth grade when he first learned to dunk. He met his future wife Regina in April 1981 at church. They were juniors at different Tulsa high schools, and she did not know he was one of the most heavily recruited basketball players in the country. Tisdale called music his \\"first love\\". Throughout his youth, and continuing through his college basketball career, he played bass guitar at his father's church. Music and church were so important to Tisdale that after recruiting him to the University of Oklahoma, Sooners head coach Billy Tubbs changed the team's practice schedule. He moved the team's Sunday practice from the morning to the evening to allow Tisdale to play at morning services in his father's church in Tulsa. Basketball career Tisdale graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he grew up. As a college player at the University of Oklahoma from 1982 to 1985, he was a three-time Big Eight Conference Player of the Year and the first player in collegiate history to be named a first-team All American by the Associated Press in his freshman, sophomore, and junior seasons. He still holds the record at Oklahoma for the most points scored by any player through his freshman and sophomore seasons. He won a gold medal as a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic basketball team coached by Indiana University's Bobby Knight. The Indiana Pacers made Tisdale the second overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft. As a power forward, Tisdale averaged over 15 points and six rebounds per game in a 12-season professional career with the Indiana Pacers, Sacramento Kings, and Phoenix Suns. His best season was in 1989‚Äì90 with the Kings, when he averaged 22.3 points and 7.5 rebounds a game. Tisdale and Mitch \\"The Rock\\" Richmond combined to form one of the most dynamic duos in the NBA at that time. Tisdale retired in 1997 to focus on his musical career. Tisdale's jersey number (23) was retired by the University of Oklahoma in 1997. When Blake Griffin was granted permission to wear it during his career at OU (2007‚Äì2009), he sought and received Tisdale's blessing before accepting it. The outstanding freshman award in the NCAA is named the Wayman Tisdale Award. Music career Wayman Tisdale and Dave Koz at the Dave Koz & Friends Smooth Jazz Cruise 2006. Tisdale launched his music career with Power Forward in 1995 on the Motown Label. Primarily a bass player, he recorded eight albums, with the 2001 release Face to Face climbing to No. 1 on Billboard's contemporary jazz chart. He was awarded the Legacy Tribute Award by the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame in 2002. In an ESPN internet chat Tisdale said his musical influences included the funk bands of the 1970s. His most recent release (and his final album before his death), Rebound, was written and released after he was diagnosed with cancer. Cancer diagnosis In March 2007, Tisdale underwent treatment for cancer in his knee (osteosarcoma), which was discovered after he fell down a flight of stairs at his home in Los Angeles on February 8, and broke his leg.Jenni Carlson, \\"Wayman Tisdale has part of his leg amputated\\", The Oklahoman, August 28, 2008. In May, Tisdale announced on his website that he was recovering from a procedure to remove the cyst, and expected to recover 100%. He and Regina agreed not to tell their four children about his diagnosis until the fall of that year, when the entire family was together (their oldest daughter lives in Atlanta and their second-oldest was attending college at the time). However, the first round of chemotherapy was unsuccessful, leading to a second round. As Tisdale recalled later, \\"The doctor had never given anyone chemo that was my size. They just calculated how much chemo to give me and said, 'We hope it doesn't mess up your kidneys. If it does, sorry.\\" He drew on some of the challenges he faced during his basketball career to battle the disease, specifically recalling, \\"I had some coaches that literally didn't want me to make it, and one in particular was Bobby Knight. At the time I frowned on that ‚Ä¶ I look at it today that had I not persevered through a lot of the stuff he put me through, I probably wouldn't be here today. I thank God for that dude because he pushed me.\\" In August 2008, Tisdale had part of his right leg amputated because of the bone cancer. On his web site, Tisdale said removing a portion of the leg would be the best way to ensure that the cancer would not return. In a video message at halftime of a September 28 Sooners' football game, Tisdale affirmed he was doing well and that he was at peace following the operation. Shortly after the operation, he was fitted for a prosthesis. Scott Sabolich, the clinical director, said that in his 21-year career he had never created a prosthesis as large as the one he had to design for Tisdale. Sabolich noted that it typically takes a new amputee from three to six months to acclimate to a prosthesis, while it took Tisdale a month. He proved to be equally quick in learning to walk on his new limb; a physical therapist Tisdale worked with in Tulsa said that he was months ahead of a typical patient in that respect. Tisdale's experience led him to establish the Wayman Tisdale Foundationhttp://www.waymantisdale.org Wayman Tisdale Foundation to raise funds to help amputees with the prosthetic process, which is not always covered by health insurance. In April 2009, Tisdale accepted an award from the Greenwood Cultural Center in Tulsa, then set off on a 21-date national concert tour.Bill Haisten, \\"Tisdale hits the road: Ex-Sooner star says he's beaten cancer, kicks off national tour\\", Tulsa World, April 17, 2009. Death Tisdale died on May 15, 2009, at St. John Medical Center in Tulsa, where his wife had taken him when he had trouble breathing. She later confirmed that he died after his esophagus ruptured following radiation treatments for his cancer. Tisdale's agent described his death as a \\"great shock\\" and noted that Tisdale had been planning to go into the recording studio the following week for a project with jazz guitarist Norman Brown.Alan Duke,\\"Wayman Tisdale, basketball star and musician, dies\\", CNN.com, May 15, 2009.

Over two million dollars' worth of humanitarian aid was donated by the LDS Church, and was disbursed to Lebanese citizens in coordination with the International Islamic Relief Organization. Latter-day Saint Charities (formerly known as \\"LDS Humanitarian Services\\") is a branch of the welfare department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The organization's stated mission is to relieve suffering, to foster self- reliance for people of all nationalities and religions, and to provide opportunities for service.Humanitarian Services Operations Guide Overview The LDS Church considers humanitarian work to be an essential part of its mission to bless all humanity in emulation of Jesus Christ \\"who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed\\" (Acts 10:38). Throughout its history, the LDS Church has always provided for those in need and is perhaps best known for its efforts to take care of its own. In 1842, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, organized the Women's Relief Society, with a primary focus to provide \\"relief\\" to suffering members and ultimately to all people. During the Great Depression the LDS Church organized a welfare program, now administered the church's Welfare Services department, to help provide for the needs of its members. As the program has grown, the church's welfare efforts have expanded to help people around the world regardless of religion, race, or nationality. LDS Humanitarian Services was created to coordinate these efforts in partnership with government and other nonprofit agencies around the world. The church's humanitarian work primarily helps those in need who are not members of the church. There are many people in virtually any community in the world who struggle to have basic needs met. The church seeks to help as many as possible. Key humanitarian initiatives include clean water, vision treatment, wheelchair provision, neonatal resuscitation, and disaster relief. Other initiatives include immunizations, family enrichment programs, and family food production. In 2008, LDS Humanitarian Services provided aid to 3.3 million people in 122 countries, and since 1985 help has been given to 23 million people in 189 nations. All of these initiatives, as well as support and advice on personal and community preparation for disasters can be found on the LDS Church's Provident Living website. The funding for LDS Humanitarian Services comes from the philanthropic support of the church's members and other donors. Donations to the Humanitarian Fund are collected through local bishops and LDS Philanthropies. LDS humanitarian initiatives Medford Pear Orchard, USA. :Emergency Response is the part of the LDS Church's humanitarian efforts of which most people are aware. Funds and supplies in this area are used to help victims of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, tornadoes, and hurricanes, as well as other disasters such as wars or political unrest. Supplies in this area are gathered and stored before a crisis so supplies can be sent within hours of an emergency. Volunteers are also on call so they can be reached and organized within a few hours, if needed. The LDS Church is renowned for its ability to organize its members in various regions of the world to respond to emergency and facilitate distributing goods immediately after a crisis, often before aid programs such as the Red Cross or the Salvation Army come to assist. In 2008, the LDS Church responded to 124 disasters in 48 countries. :Wheelchair Distribution is another church program crucial to helping those in need. Studies estimate that only one percent of the disabled in the world have wheelchairs. For the rest, being without a wheelchair means adults can not provide for themselves or their families, and for children it often means not being able to attend school. By providing wheelchairs to those in need, the church hopes to help people become more self-reliant which is an important tenet of LDS beliefs. :The Clean Water Service provides clean water and wells to people who otherwise would most likely contract deadly diseases because of the dirty water. It is estimated that one billion people lack clean water. The clean water program is designed to partner with local community agencies to provide sustainable clean water. :The Neonatal Resuscitation program sends doctors and volunteers to areas where infant mortality rate is high. They are able to teach people in the area how to resuscitate newborns as well as provide simple medical equipment. This service is greatly needed as it is estimated that nearly 1 million newborns die each year due to birth difficulties. Up to 10% of newborns have breathing difficulties. :The Vision Treatment Training program teaches facilities and medical personnel in developing countries how to treat preventable or reversible blindness. There are 37 million people in the world who are blind, and up to 75 % of blindness is treatable. The vision care program works with local vision health care centers to help treat and prevent blindness for the poor. In addition to these efforts, the LDS Church also has over 300 job development and placement centers around the world. In 2001, the church began the Perpetual Education Fund which provides money to cover tuition and other school expenses to people in developing nations. As of 2007, tens of thousands of individuals had been given assistance. So far this program has operated primarily in South America and Oceania. The LDS Church has also begun producing a nutrition-rich porridge named Atmit to help during acute famines. The church welfare program owns farms, ranches, canneries, and other food producing facilities to provide temporary food relief for families and individuals. LDS Humanitarian Services frequently works with other charities and NGOs such as the Red Cross, Catholic charities and even various Islamic charities for which the LDS Church has produced halaal food. Sources and funds for humanitarian work All of these initiatives require manpower and while there are some full-time employees in administrative and clerical functions, there are also thousands of volunteer humanitarian missionaries. In emergency situations, local members and full-time missionaries who would normally devote their time to proselyting will participate in relief efforts, but in many of these more permanent initiatives the LDS Church uses senior- aged missionary couples. These couples are retired church members who devote six months to two years of their time to go anywhere in the world, typically at their own expense, to participate in these projects. Because of this volunteer force, the church is able to use 100 percent of money and goods donated in helping those in need. These missionaries often serve in activities related to their former profession. Doctors and nurses will serve medical missions either in the Neonatal Resuscitation programs or special missions to countries in need of dentists, eye doctors, surgeons and so forth. People with agricultural or engineering backgrounds will serve on the clean water initiative or else help farmers in developing countries. Other members who are still working and raising families frequently donate time, money, and in-kind donations to help in these ventures. Members can volunteer at local canneries and farms to help produce food for the needy. They can volunteer to create the medical kits needed for doctors and new mothers in developing nations and many help make blankets for needy families. Many of these local initiatives are organized by the Relief Society. This volunteer force allows the LDS Church to reduce operating expenses and serve more people with their resources. From 1985 to 2009, $327.6 million in cash and $884.6 million in commodities of aid was given throughout 178 countries. In Africa The church has been involved in several humanitarian aid projects in Africa. On January 27, 1985, members across the world joined together in a fast for \\"the victims of famine and other causes resulting in hunger and privation among people of Africa.\\" They also donated the money that would have been used for food during the fast to help those victims, regardless of church membership. Together with other organizations such as UNICEF and the American Red Cross, the church worked towards eradicating measles. Since 1999, there has been a 60 percent drop in deaths from measles in Africa.\\"Church Works to Eradicate Measles in Africa\\", Meridian Magazine, January 31, 2007. Due to the church's efforts, the American Red Cross gave the First Presidency the organization's highest financial support honor, the American Red Cross Circle of Humanitarians award.\\"American Red Cross Recognizes Church for Support of Measles Initiative in Africa\\", mormonnewsroom.org, February 8, 2005 The church has also been involved in humanitarian aid in Africa by sending food boxes,\\"Food Boxes Rushed to Ease Starvation in Africa\\", mormonnewsroom.org, May 30, 2002. digging wells to provide clean water,\\"Clean Water Projects\\", mormonnewsroom.org, accessed March 8, 2016. distributing wheelchairs,\\"Wheelchair Distribution\\", mormonnewsroom.org, accessed March 8, 2016. providing Neonatal Resuscitation Training,\\"Church Works to Save Infants Through Neonatal Resuscitation Training\\", mormonnewsroom.org, March 14, 2007. and setting up employment resources service centers.\\"Employment Resource Service Centers\\", mormonnewsroom.org, accessed March 8, 2016.

He served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1830. Early life and education Ingersoll was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Jared Ingersoll and Elizabeth Petit. His father served in the Continental Congress and his brother of Joseph Reed Ingersoll served as a member of the U.S. House of Representative for Pennsylvania. His maternal grandfather, Charles Pettit, served as a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Confederation Congress. Charles Ingersoll dropped out of the College of New Jersey, later Princeton University, in 1799. He then studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1802 and commenced practice in Philadelphia. He traveled in Europe, accompanied by Rufus King, the United States minister to the United Kingdom. Career In 1812, Ingersoll was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Thirteenth Congress, where he served as chairman of the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1814, having been appointed United States district attorney for Pennsylvania. He served in that office from 1815 to 1829, and was a member of the Pennsylvania canal and internal improvement convention in 1825. In 1829, he was removed from the office of district attorney by U.S. President Andrew Jackson. He was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1830, and a member of the State constitutional convention in 1837. He was appointed secretary of the legation to Prussia on March 8, 1837. He was an unsuccessful candidate in 1837 for election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Francis J. Harper in the Twenty-fifth Congress. He was again an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1838. Ingersoll was elected as a Democrat to the Twenty-seventh and to the three succeeding Congresses. He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs during the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Congresses). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1848. He was appointed Minister to France in 1847 but was not confirmed by the Senate. He died in 1862 in Philadelphia and is interred at The Woodlands Cemetery. Personal life In 1804, Ingersoll married Mary Wilcocks, the daughter of Alexander Wilcocks, and together had six surviving sons and 2 daughters. His son Edward Ingersoll wrote on legal topics.

B. Rhine, was an American botanist who founded parapsychology as a branch of psychology, founding the parapsychology lab at Duke University, the Journal of Parapsychology, the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man, and the Parapsychological Association. Rhine wrote the books Extrasensory Perception and Parapsychology: Frontier Science of the Mind. Early life and education Joseph Banks Rhine was the second child of five children born to Samuel Ellis Rhine and Elizabeth Vaughan Rhine in Waterloo, Juniata County, Pennsylvania. Samuel Rhine had been educated in a Harrisburg business college, had taught school and later been a farmer and merchant. The family moved to Marshallville, Ohio, when Joseph was in his early teens.Denis, Brian. (1982). The Enchanted Voyager. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice‚ÄìHall He was educated at Ohio Northern University and the College of Wooster, after which he enlisted in the Marine Corps, and was stationed in Santiago. Afterwards, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he received his master's degree in botany in 1923 and a Ph.D. in botany in 1925.Joseph Banks Rhine: 1895‚Äì1980 American Journal of Psychology, December 1981, Vol. 94, No. 4, pp. 649‚Äì653. While there, he and his wife Louisa E. Rhine were impressed by a May 1922 lecture given by Arthur Conan Doyle exulting the scientific proof of communication with the dead. Rhine later wrote, \\"This mere possibility was the most exhilarating thought I had had in years.\\"Joseph Rinn. (1950). Sixty Years of Psychical Research: Houdini and I Among the Spirits. Truth Seeker Company. He taught for a year at Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, in Yonkers, New York. Afterwards, he enrolled in the psychology department at Harvard University, to study for a year with Professor William McDougall. In 1927, he moved to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina to work under Professor McDougall. Rhine began the studies that helped develop parapsychology into a branch of science; he looked at parapsychology as a branch of \\"abnormal psychology.\\" Mediumship Rhine lent an insight into the medium Mina Crandon's performances. Rhine was able to observe some of her trickery in the dark when she used luminous objects.Thomas Tietze. (1973). Margery. Harper & Row. Rhine claimed to have observed Crandon in fraud in a s√©ance in 1926. According to Rhine during the s√©ance she was free from control and kicked a megaphone to give the impression it was levitating.Massimo Polidoro. (2001). Final S√©ance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle. Prometheus Books. pp. 134-234. Rhine's report that documented the fraud was refused by the American Society for Psychical Research, so he published it in the Journal of Abnormal Social Psychology. In response, defenders of Crandon attacked Rhine. Arthur Conan Doyle published an article in a Boston newspaper claiming \\"J. B. Rhine is an Ass.\\" Rhine, who had caught Crandon free from control and kicking a megaphone during a s√©ance, wondered why J. Malcolm Bird with three years of experience did not expose any of her tricks. Rhine suspected that Bird was a confederate of the medium. ESP research Hubert Pearce with Joseph Banks Rhine. Rhine tested many students as volunteer subjects in his research project. His first exceptional subject in this ESP research was Adam Linzmayer, an economics undergraduate at Duke. In 1931, Linzmayer scored very highly in preliminary Zener card tests that Rhine ran him through; initially, he scored 100% correct on two short (nine-card series) tests that Rhine gave him. Even in his first long test (a 300-card series), Linzmayer scored 39.6% correct scores, when chance would have been only 20%. He consecutively scored 36% each time on three 25-card series (chance being 20%). However, over time, Linzmayer's scores began to drop down much closer to (but still above) chance averages. Boredom, distraction, and competing obligations, on Linzmayer's part, were conjectured as possible factors bearing on the declining test results. Linzmayer's epic run of naming 21 out of 25 took place in Rhine's car. The following year, Rhine tested another promising individual, Hubert Pearce, who managed to surpass Linzmayer's overall 1931 performance. (Pearce's average during the period he was tested in 1932 was 40%, whereas chance would have been 20%.) However, Pearce was actually allowed to handle the cards most of the time. He shuffled and cut them. The most famous series of experiments from Rhine's laboratory is arguably the ESP tests involving Hubert Pearce and Joseph Gaither Pratt, a research assistant. Pearce was tested (using Zener cards) by Pratt, who shuffled and recorded the order of the cards in the parapsychology lab 100 yards from where Pearce was sitting in a campus library cubicle. The series comprised 37 25-trial runs, conducted between August 1933 and March 1934. From run to run, the number of matches between Pratt's cards and Pearce's guesses was highly variable, generally deviating significantly above-chance, but also falling dramatically below-chance. These scores were obtained irrespective of the distance between Pratt and Pearce, which was arranged as either 100 or 250 yards. In 1934, drawing upon several years of meticulous lab research and statistical analysis, Rhine published the first edition of a book titled Extra-Sensory Perception, which in various editions was widely read over the next decades.W. Edward Craighead and Charles B. Nemeroff (2001). \\"Rhine, Joseph Banks\\" in The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science, John Wiley, p. 1411. In the later 1930s, Rhine investigated \\"psychokinesis\\" ‚Äì again reducing the subject to simple terms so that it could be tested, with controls, in a laboratory setting. Rhine relied on testing whether a subject could influence the outcome of tossed dice ‚Äì initially with hand-thrown dice, later with dice thrown from a cup, and finally with machine-thrown dice. In 1940 Rhine co-authored with Joseph Gaither Pratt and other associates at Duke Extra-Sensory Perception After Sixty Years, a review of all experimental studies of clairvoyance and telepathy. It has been recognized as the first meta-analysis in the history of science.B√∂sch, H. (2004). Reanalyzing a meta-analysis on extra-sensory perception dating from 1940, the first comprehensive meta-analysis in the history of science. In S. Schmidt (Ed.), Proceedings of the 47th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association, University of Vienna, (pp. 1‚Äì13). During the war years, Rhine lost most of his male staff members to war work or the military. This caused something of an hiatus in the conduct of new research, but the opportunity was taken to publish the large backlog of experiments that had been conducted since the early 1930s on psychokinesis. After the war, he had occasion to study some dramatic cases outside the lab. Rhine's wife, Louisa E. Rhine, pursued work that complemented her husband's in the later 1940s, gathering information on spontaneous ESP reports (experiences people had, outside of a laboratory setting). Yet Rhine believed that a good groundwork should be laid in the lab, so that the scientific community might take parapsychology seriously. In the early 1960s, Rhine left Duke and founded the Institute for Parapsychology, which later became the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man. In the 1970s, several high-scoring subjects ‚Äì Sean Harribance, M.B. Dykshoorn, and Bill Delmore ‚Äì were tested in the lab, shortly before Rhine's retirement. Legacy Rhine, along with William McDougall, introduced the term \\"parapsychology\\" (translating a German term coined by Max Dessoir). It is sometimes said that Rhine almost single-handedly developed a methodology and concepts for parapsychology as a form of experimental psychology; however great his contributions, some earlier work along similar ‚Äî analytical and statistical ‚Äî lines had been undertaken sporadically in Europe, notably the experimental work of Oliver Lodge.Mauskopf, S. H./McVaugh, M. R. (1980). The Elusive Science: Origins of Experimental Psychical Research. Baltimore, ML, US: Johns Hopkins University Press. Rhine founded the institutions necessary for parapsychology's continuing professionalization in the U.S. -- including the establishment of the Journal of Parapsychology and the formation of the Parapsychological Association,W. Edward Craighead and Charles B. Nemeroff (2001). \\"Rhine, Joseph Banks\\" in The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science, John Wiley, p. 1412. and also the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man (FRNM), a precursor to what is today known as the Rhine Research Center. His parapsychology research organization was originally affiliated with Duke University, but is now separate. He also had a huge influence on science fiction after John W. Campbell became obsessed with his theories about psionic powers and ideas about future human evolution.Clarkesworld Magazine - Science Fiction & Fantasy : ‚ÄúFans Are Slans‚Äù: A Study in Campbellian Influence Reception Rhine's results have never been duplicated by the scientific community.C. E. M. Hansel. (1980). ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re- evaluation. Prometheus Books. pp. 86-122. Terence Hines. (2003). Pseudoscience and the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 122. \\"The procedural errors in the Rhine experiments have been extremely damaging to his claims to have demonstrated the existence of ESP. Equally damaging has been the fact that the results have not replicated when the experiments have been conducted in other laboratories.\\" A number of psychological departments attempted to repeat Rhine's experiments, but failed. W. S. Cox (1936) from Princeton University with 132 subjects produced 25,064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment.Cox, W. S. (1936). An Experiment in ESP. Journal of Experimental Psychology 12: 437. Cox concluded \\"There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the 'average man' or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects.\\" Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine's results.Joseph Jastrow. (1938). ESP, House of Cards. The American Scholar. Vol. 8, No. 1. pp. 13-22. \\"Rhine‚Äôs results fail to be confirmed. At Colgate University (40, 000 tests, 7 subjects), at Chicago (extensive series on 315 students), at Southern Methodist College (75, 000 tests), at Glasgow, Scotland (6, 650 tests), at London University (105, 000 tests), not a single individual was found who under rigidly conducted experiments could score above chance. At Stanford University it has been convincingly shown that the conditions favorable to the intrusion of subtle errors produce above-chance records which come down to chance when sources of error are eliminated.\\"Cited in C.

Crumbaugh wrote: > At the time [1938] of performing the experiments involved I fully expected > that they would yield easily all the final answers.

A Scientific Critique of Parapsychology. > International Journal of Neuropsychiatry 5: 521‚Äì29. It was revealed that Rhine's experiments into extrasensory perception (ESP) contained methodological flaws.Charles M. Wynn, Arthur W. Wiggins. (2001). Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins. Joseph Henry Press. p. 156. \\"In 1940, Rhine coauthored a book, Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years in which he suggested that something more than mere guess work was involved in his experiments. He was right! It is now known that the experiments conducted in his laboratory contained serious methodological flaws. Tests often took place with minimal or no screening between the subject and the person administering the test. Subjects could see the backs of cards that were later discovered to be so cheaply printed that a faint outline of the symbol could be seen. Furthermore, in face-to-face tests, subjects could see card faces reflected in the tester‚Äôs eyeglasses or cornea. They were even able to (consciously or unconsciously) pick up clues from the tester‚Äôs facial expression and voice inflection. In addition, an observant subject could identify the cards by certain irregularities like warped edges, spots on the backs, or design imperfections.\\" The psychologists Leonard Zusne and Warren Jones have written that \\"the keeping of records in Rhine‚Äôs experiments was inadequate. Sometimes, the subject would help with the checking of his or her calls against the order of cards. In some long-distance telepathy experiments, the order of the cards passed through the hands of the percipient before it got from Rhine to the agent.\\"Leonard Zusne, Warren Jones. (1989). Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking. Psychology Press. p. 158. The card-guessing method used in the Rhine experiments contained flaws that did not rule out the possibility of sensory leakage. Today, researchers discount the first decade of Rhine's work with Zener cards. Stimulus leakage or cheating could account for all his findings. Slight indentations on the backs of cards revealed the symbols embossed on card faces. Subjects could see and hear the experimenter, and note subtle but revealing facial expressions or changes in breathing. According to Terence Hines: > The methods the Rhines used to prevent subjects from gaining hints and clues > as to the design on the cards were far from adequate. In many experiments, > the cards were displayed face up, but hidden behind a small wooden shield. > Several ways of obtaining information about the design on the card remain > even in the presence of the shield. For instance, the subject may be able > sometimes to see the design on the face-up card reflected in the agent‚Äôs > glasses. Even if the agent isn‚Äôt wearing glasses it is possible to see the > reflection in his cornea.Terence Hines. (2003). Pseudoscience and the > Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 119-120. In 1938, Harold Gulliksen wrote that Rhine did not describe his experimental methods clearly and used inappropriate mathematical procedures which overestimated the significance of his results.Harold Gulliksen. (1938). Extra- Sensory Perception: What Is It?. American Journal of Sociology. Vol. 43, No. 4. pp. 623-634. Rhine published Extra-Sensory Perception After Sixty Years in 1940 with a number of colleagues, to address the objections raised. In the book, Rhine and his colleagues described three experiments‚Äîthe Pearce-Pratt experiment, the Pratt-Woodruff experiment and the Ownbey-Zirkle series‚Äîwhich they believed demonstrated ESP. The psychologist C. E. M. Hansel wrote \\"it is now known that each experiment contained serious flaws that escaped notice in the examination made by the authors of Extra-Sensory Perception After Sixty Years\\".C. E. M. Hansel. The Search for a Demonstration of ESP. In Paul Kurtz. (1985). A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. pp. 97-127. Rhine's experiments into psychokinesis (PK) were not replicated by other scientists.Charles M. Wynn, Arthur W. Wiggins. (2001). Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins. Joseph Henry Press. p. 163. \\"The same Dr. Rhine who studied ESP also studied and felt he had evidence for PK. Attempts to replicate Rhine's findings under controlled conditions all failed. Successful tests of PK reported by him were the result of inadequate controls or falsification of data.\\" John Sladek wrote: > His research used dice, with subjects 'willing' them to fall a certain way. > Not only can dice be drilled, shaved, falsely numbered and manipulated, but > even straight dice often show bias in the long run. Casinos for this reason > retire dice often, but at Duke, subjects continued to try for the same > effect on the same dice over long experimental runs. Not surprisingly, PK > appeared at Duke and nowhere else.John Sladek. (1974). The New Apocrypha: A > Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs. Panther. pp. 172-174. The science writer Martin Gardner wrote that Rhine repeatedly tried to replicate his work, but produced only failures that he never reported.Paul Kurtz. (2001). Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World's Leading Paranormal Inquirers. Chapter Confessions of a Skeptic by Martin Gardner. Prometheus Books. Gardner criticized Rhine for not disclosing the names of assistants he caught cheating: > His paper \\"Security Versus Deception in Parapsychology\\" published in his > journal (vol. 38, 1974), runs to 23 pages... Rhine selects twelve sample > cases of dishonest experimenters that came to his attention from 1940 to > 1950, four of whom were caught 'red-handed'. Not a single name is mentioned. > What papers did they publish, one wonders? This has suggested to Gardner that Rhine practiced a \\"secrecy policy\\". Gardner claimed to have inside information that files in Rhine's laboratory contain material suggesting fraud on the part of Hubert Pearce.Kendrick Frazier. (1991). The Hundredth Monkey: And Other Paradigms of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 169. Pearce was never able to obtain above-chance results when persons other than the experimenter were present during an experiment making it more likely that he was cheating in some way. Rhine's other subjects were only able to obtain non-chance levels when they were able to shuffle the cards, which has suggested they used tricks to arrange the order of the Zener cards before the experiments started.Lawrie Reznek. (2010). Delusions and the Madness of the Masses. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p. 54. According to James Alcock, due to Rhine's errors, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies.James Alcock. (2011). Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair . Skeptical Inquirer. \\"Despite Rhine‚Äôs confidence that he had established the reality of extrasensory perception, he had not done so. Methodological problems with his experiments eventually came to light, and as a result parapsychologists no longer run card-guessing studies and rarely even refer to Rhine‚Äôs work.\\" Rhine has been described as credulous as he believed the horse \\"Lady Wonder\\" was telepathic, but it was discovered the owner was using subtle signals to control the horse's behavior.Victor Stenger. (1990). Physics and Psychics: The Search for a World Beyond the Senses. Prometheus Books. p. 167. Historian Ruth Brandon has written that Rhine's research was not balanced or objective, instead \\"motivated by the most extreme ideology\\" of vitalism.Ruth Brandon. (1983).

Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. Robonaut differs from other current space-faring robots in that, while most current space robotic systems (such as robotic arms, cranes and exploration rovers) are designed to move large objects, Robonaut's tasks require more dexterity. The core idea behind the Robonaut series is to have a humanoid machine work alongside astronauts. Its form factor and dexterity are designed such that Robonaut can use space tools and work in similar environments suited to astronauts. The latest Robonaut version, R2, the first US-built robot on the ISS, delivered by STS-133 in Feb 2011, is a robotic torso designed to assist with crew EVA's and can hold tools used by the crew. However, Robonaut 2 does not have adequate protection needed to exist outside the space station and enhancements and modifications would be required to allow it to move around the station's interior. NASA states \\"Robonauts are essential to NASA's future as we go beyond low Earth orbit\\", and R2 will provide performance data about how a robot may work side-by-side with astronauts. Robonaut 1 Robonaut 1 (R1) was the first model. The two Robonaut versions (R1A and R1B) had many partners including DARPA. None were flown to space. Other designs for Robonaut propose uses for teleoperation on planetary surfaces, where Robonaut could explore a planetary surface while receiving instructions from orbiting astronauts above. Robonaut B was introduced in 2002, R1B is a portable version of R1. R1 had several lower bodies. One of these was the Zero-G Leg, which if Robonaut was working on the space station he would climb using the external handrails and then use his zero-g leg to latch onto the station using a WIF socket. Another was the Robotic Mobility Platform (RMP), developed in 2003, it is a base with two wheels using a Segway PT. And the four wheeled Centaur 1, which was developed in 2006. Robonaut has participated in NASA's Desert Research and Technology Studies field trials in the Arizona desert. In 2006, the automotive company General Motors expressed interest in the project and proposed to team up with NASA. In 2007 a Space Act Agreement was signed that allowed GM and NASA to work together on the next generation of Robonaut.

R2 is capable of speeds more than four times faster than R1, is more compact, more dexterous, and includes a deeper and wider range of sensing. It can move its arms up to 2 m/s, has a 40 lb payload capacity and its hands have a grasping force of roughly 5 lbs. per finger. There are over 350 sensors and 38 PowerPC processors in the robot. Station crew members will be able to operate R2, as will controllers on the ground; both will do so using telepresence. One of the improvements over the previous Robonaut generation is that R2 does not need constant supervision. In anticipation of a future destination in which distance and time delays would make continuous management problematic, R2 was designed to be set to tasks and then carry them through autonomously with periodic status checks. While not all human range of motion and sensitivity has been duplicated, the robot's hand has 12 degrees of freedom as well as 2 degrees of freedom in wrist. The R2 model also uses touch sensors at the tips of its fingers. R2 was designed as a prototype to be used on Earth but mission managers were impressed by R2 and chose to send it to the ISS. Various upgrades were made to qualify it for use inside the station. The outer skin materials were exchanged to meet the station's flammability requirements, shielding was added to reduce electromagnetic interference, processors were upgraded to increase the robot's radiation tolerance, the original fans were replaced with quieter ones to accommodate the station's noise requirements, and the power system was rewired to run on the station's direct current system rather than the alternating current used on the ground. 250 px Robonaut 2 was launched on STS-133 on February 24, 2011, and delivered to the ISS. On August 22, R2 was powered up for the first time while in low earth orbit. This was called a \\"power soak\\" which is a power system test only with no movement. On October 13, R2 moved for the first time while in space. The conditions aboard the space station provide a proving ground for robots to work shoulder to shoulder with people in microgravity. Once this has been demonstrated inside the station, software upgrades and lower bodies may be added, allowing R2 to move around the interior of the station and perform maintenance tasks, such as vacuuming or cleaning filters. A pair of legs were delivered to the ISS on SpX-3 in April 2014. The battery backpack was planned to be launched on a later flight in Summer/Fall 2014. In the design of the R2 robot, a 3D time of flight imager will be used in conjunction with a stereo camera pair to provide depth information and visible stereo images to the system. This allows the R2 to \\"see\\", which is one of the basic preconditions to fulfill its tasks. To integrate the various sensor data types in a single development environment the image processing software Halcon 9.0 from MVTec Software (Munich, Germany ) is used. Further upgrades could be added to allow R2 to work outside in the vacuum of space, where R2 could help space walkers perform repairs, make additions to the station or conduct scientific experiments. While there were initially no plans to return the launched R2 back to earth, NASA announced on 1 April 2018 that R2 would return to Earth in May 2018 with CRS-14 Dragon for repair and eventual relaunch in about a year's time. NASA's experience with R2 on the station will help them understand its capabilities for possible deep space missions.

It is one of the many take-offs of James Bond produced during the 1960s, but is based on an already established detective fiction hero, Bulldog Drummond. Richard Johnson (director Terence Young's original preference to play James Bond) stars as Drummond, updated to a suave Korean War veteran, now an insurance investigator, trailing a pair of sexy assassins (Elke Sommer and Sylva Koscina) who kill for sport and profit. Drummond's American nephew, Robert Drummond (Steve Carlson, then a Universal Pictures contract star), becomes involved in the intrigue when he comes to visit. The title is a reference to the 1911 Rudyard Kipling poem \\"The Female of the Species\\", which includes the line, \\"The female of the species must be deadlier than the male\\", and also refers to Sapper's earlier Drummond book, The Female of the Species. The working title of the film was The Female of the Species.p. 197 Spicer, Andrew Sydney Box Manchester University Press, 05/09/2006 \\"Deadlier Than the Male\\", the song featured in the film's opening credit sequence, was performed by the Walker Brothers. Filmed in Technicolor and Techniscope, portions of the film were shot in Lerici, La Spezia, Liguria, Italy. A sequel, Some Girls Do, followed in 1969. Plot Glamorous assassin Irma Eckman (Elke Sommer), disguised as an air stewardess, kills oil tycoon Henry Keller (Dervis Ward) with a booby-trapped cigar aboard his private jet, parachuting away before the plane explodes. She is picked up by a speedboat driven by her partner in crime, the equally beautiful Penelope (Sylva Koscina). The villainous pair then murder David Wyngarde (John Stone), making it look like a spear fishing accident. Sir John Bledlow (Laurence Naismith), one of the directors of Phoenecian Oil, suspects that both deaths were the result of foul play; he had received an urgent message from Wyngarde that he needed to get in touch with Keller regarding a \\"matter of life and death\\". He asks Wyngarde's friend, Hugh \\"Bulldog\\" Drummond (Richard Johnson), to investigate. A representative of an unknown party had approached Phoenecian and offered to overcome Keller's opposition to a merger with Phoenician within six months for one million pounds. Irma shows up at a board meeting to collect. However, the board is divided ‚Äì with Henry Bridgenorth (Leonard Rossiter) being the most vocal in opposition ‚Äì and the vote is five to four against paying. That night, Irma and Penelope visit Bridgenorth at his apartment, with fatal results. When the board reconvenes, the directors vote unanimously to pay. Carloggio (George Pastell), Wyngarde's servant, delivers a tiny bit of a taped message Wyngarde had recorded. Only part of one sentence remains (the assassins stole the rest). Irma and Penelope silence Carloggio, then Penelope delivers a box of deadly cigars to Drummond's flat while he is out. Brenda (Virginia North), a girl Drummond's nephew Robert (Steve Carlson) has brought back to the flat, narrowly escapes the same fate as Keller. Later that night, another attempt is made on Drummond's life. The next day, Irma makes Phoenecian another proposition: to get them the oil concession in the country of Akmata, despite the King's determination to develop the oil fields himself, for another million pounds. Drummond realises that the King's assassination is what the garbled tape was referring to. Meanwhile, Penelope abducts and tortures Robert, but he can tell her nothing. Drummond follows Irma back to their flat and is able to rescue Robert before he is blown up by a bomb left behind by the two women. He is then astonished to discover that Robert is an old college friend of the Akmatan King Fedra (Zia Mohyeddin). Irma does away with Weston (Nigel Green), another Phoenecian board member. Drummond travels to the Mediterranean coast. After meeting and warning King Fedra, he is invited to a castle owned by the wealthy Carl Petersen, the genius behind the assassinations. It turns out that Petersen is none other than Weston. Drummond is not allowed to leave the castle. Grace (Suzanna Leigh), one of Petersen's women, confides her desire to leave to Drummond, but Petersen is watching and listening electronically. Irma attempts to seduce Drummond to distract him, but to her fury, he rejects her advances. Penelope is more successful and spends the night in Drummond's bed. Petersen gives Grace a \\"second chance\\"; she uses the opportunity to board the King's yacht as soon as she has the chance, just as Petersen had planned. While playing chess against Petersen with giant motorized pieces, Drummond learns that Grace is unwittingly carrying the bomb intended for the King. He kills Petersen's bodyguard Chang (Milton Reid) and drops Petersen into the hole through which a chess piece is removed from play. Drummond and Robert race to the King's yacht, capturing Irma and Penelope along the way, and bringing them along. When Irma and Penelope refuse to tell him where the bomb is hidden, Drummond searches Grace for the explosive, finally stripping her naked and throwing her overboard. When the guard holding Irma and Penelope at gunpoint is distracted by this, the pair escape. As they race away in a speedboat, Irma reveals that the bomb is in Grace's hairclip. Penelope is aghast; having envied Grace's chignon, she stole it and is wearing it. The two assassins are killed when it explodes. Meanwhile, Drummond and Robert dive into the sea to rescue Grace.

The film was publicity announced in December 1964 (under the title of Female of the Species) but it wasn't filmed until 1966. It was the first production from Amerlon Productions, a subsidiary of Inflight, the company that showed in-flight movies. Richard Johnson, then best known for being the husband of Kim Novak, was cast as Drummond. Filming began in London on 23 May 1966. In an interview, Ralph Thomas stated that the film was intended as a pilot for a television series.Dixon, Wheeler W. Ralph Thomas Interview Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth-Century Cinema 2001 SIU Press It was filmed in three months with Thomas admitting he did it for \\"greed. I had three months; they gave me a lot of money; I had a lot of fun and I enjoyed making it. It was a great location and the picture looked gorgeous. That's it.\\"Dixon p 113 Sommer was paid $170,000 for her role. Johnson later said: > I consciously tried to use more of myself than in anything else I've done... > It was an entirely new creation that was not in the Drummond books. I > couldn't respect the man. He was bigoted and brutal. A Nazi character. I > didn't attempt to make myself into that character. We started with a fresh > page. I said, all right, if you want me, you'll get me, but this is a > braver, more physical version of me. The producers battled the British Board of Film Censors who strongly objected to the film's use of women assassins, torture and promiscuity, earning the film an X rating.p.197 Spicer References External links  Review of film at Variety *Article on Chess Pieces at moon city garbage agency Films based on Bulldog Drummond 1967 films 1960s crime films 1960s spy thriller films 1960s action films British films British spy thriller films British action films British crime films English-language films Films directed by Ralph Thomas Films produced by Betty Box Films set in the Mediterranean Sea Films shot in Italy Films shot at Pinewood Studios Reboot films Films with screenplays by Jimmy Sangster ","title":"Deadlier Than the Male"},{"id":"1347608","text":"Amnon Linn (; 29 March 1924 - 21 July 2016) was an Israeli politician.

He met his wife, Ruth Hushi, daughter of Abba Hushi in 1945, and married her later that same year. He has two sons - Shai and Ran, and one daughter - Orna. Linn joined Mapai, the ruling party, in 1951, and was appointed director of the Arab Department of the party in the north of the country, a job he held until 1965 when he became national Director of the Arab Department. In the same year Mapai and Ahdut HaAvoda merged to form the Alignment. In the 1965 elections he narrowly missed out on winning a seat in the Knesset; he was placed 48th on the Alignment's list, but the party won only 45 seats. However, following the resignation of two Alignment MKs and the death of Minister of Police Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit, Linn entered the Knesset in 1967. However, he lost his seat in the 1969 elections. Linn returned to the Knesset after the 1973 election, this time as a member of Likud. He was re-elected in 1977 and 1981, but in 1982, along with most other members of the Movement for Haifa and the North (which he had founded in 1977), he defected back to the Alignment. He was re-elected in 1984 as an Alignment MK and chaired the Knesset subcommittee for the civil guard in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), but lost his seat in 1988.

Biography Born in Dorchester County, Maryland, Trippe was appointed a midshipman in the Navy on 5 April 1799. During the Quasi-War with France, he made his first cruise in the frigate Constitution and later served in the schooner Experiment. On 21 May, he was assigned to Commodore Richard Dale's flagship President, and he served in her until early 1802 in operations against the Tripolitan corsairs in the Mediterranean. He returned to the United States in April 1802 and received a furlough to make a mercantile voyage. On 24 May 1803, the Navy Department ordered Trippe to Vixen as an acting lieutenant. The schooner sailed for the Mediterranean on 3 August and joined Commodore Edward Preble's squadron off Tripoli on 14 September 1803. Lieutenant Trippe served with distinction in the Mediterranean until the fall of 1805. On 3 August 1804, he led his crew of Gunboat Number 6, manned by another midshipman and nine sailors, to victory over the 36-man crew of a large Tripolitan boat. Trippe and his men boarded the enemy, and Trippe himself grappled with the leader of the pirates. Though his adversary towered over him, Lt. Trippe used his own agility and tenacity to emerge victorious in a desperate hand-to-hand struggle. Seriously wounded, he was unable to participate in the next three of Preble's five attacks on Tripoli. However, by the beginning of September, he had recovered sufficiently to resume command of Gunboat No. 6 for the fifth and final assault carried out on the 3d. For his gallentry in action against the Barbary pirates, Lt. Trippe received a sword and a commendation from Congress. Trippe returned to the United States in November 1805, but 1806 found him back on duty in the Mediterranean. In 1808, Trippe served at Charleston, South Carolina, enforcing the embargo legislation. He took command of Enterprise on 23 January 1809, departed New York on 24 June, and headed for the Netherlands. On 31 July, he reached Amsterdam, where he delivered official dispatches and conducted negotiations which helped cement commercial relations between the Netherlands and the United States. Having helped open Dutch ports to American shipping, he weighed anchor on 10 October and reentered New York harbor on 2 December. On 26 April, Trippe transferred to the command of Vixen and, a month later, departed New Castle, Delaware, bound for New Orleans, Louisiana. Off Stirrup Key on 24 June, Vixen came under the fire of a British ship, HMS Moselle. When summoned on board the Britisher, Trippe refused, cleared Vixen for action, and demanded an explanation of Moselle's untoward action. Her captain responded with an apology, stating that he had mistaken the American man-of-war for a Frenchman. Vixen then continued peacefully on her way and put into Havana, Cuba, six days later. On 9 July 1810, while en route from Havana to New Orleans, Lt. Trippe died of yellow fever. He was the great-great-grandfather of Juan T. Trippe, Pan Am's founder and Chairman, and great-great-great-grandfather of artist Jim Trippe. Namesakes Four ships in the United States Navy have been named USS Trippe for him.

The school's aim is to train and educate outstanding classical ballet dancers for the Royal Ballet (based at the Royal Opera House in London) and the Birmingham Royal Ballet. Admission to the school is based purely on talent and potential, regardless of academic ability or personal circumstances, and 90% of current students rely on financial support to attend the school. The school is based over two sites, White Lodge, Richmond Park (for students aged 11‚Äì16) and Covent Garden (for students from 16‚Äì19 years old) based in purpose- built studios on Floral Street, adjacent to the Royal Opera House. The Royal Ballet School has produced dancers and choreographers of international renown, including Dame Margot Fonteyn, Dame Beryl Grey, Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Dame Darcey Bussell, Alessandra Ferri and Viviana Durante, Sergei Polunin, as well as current Director of The Royal Ballet Kevin O'Hare. Graduates of the school have also achieved employment in musical theatre, contemporary and jazz dance, television and film. History In 1926, the Irish-born dancer Ninette de Valois founded the Academy of Choreographic Art, a dance school for girls and the predecessor of today's Royal Ballet School. Her intention was to form a repertory ballet company and school, leading her to collaborate with theatrical producer and theatre owner Lilian Baylis. Baylis owned the Old Vic theatre and acquired Sadler's Wells theatre in 1925. In 1928, she engaged de Valois to stage dance performances at both theatres and she re-opened Sadler's Wells theatre in 1931, with de Valois' school moving into studios on the site as the Sadler's Wells Ballet School, teaching both boys and girls. At the same time, the Vic-Wells Ballet Company was formed using students of the school and other notable dancers of the era. Both the school and the ballet company developed quickly and after ballet performances ceased at the Old Vic, the ballet company was renamed the Sadler's Wells Ballet. In 1946, the company moved to become the resident ballet company at the newly re-opened Royal Opera House in Covent Garden and as a result, in 1947 the school moved from Sadler's Wells to premises in Barons Court, with academic education being introduced for younger students. Following rapid expansion, in 1955 the school secured the premises at White Lodge in Richmond Park, London. This was established at the time as the Royal Ballet 'Lower School', a residential boarding school for children aged 11‚Äì16, combining general education and vocational ballet training. The Royal Ballet School 'Upper School' was established at the school's existing premises in Barons Court with students studying ballet on a full-time basis between the ages of 16‚Äì19. In October 1956, a Royal Charter was granted officially linking the ballet company and school and they became The Royal Ballet School and Royal Ballet Company. A second smaller company still performed at Sadler's Wells and toured around the UK and this became the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet. de Valois retired as Director in 1970. In 1990, the Sadler's Wells company moved to become the resident ballet company at the Birmingham Hippodrome, in Birmingham, where it was renamed Birmingham Royal Ballet, forming a new association with the Elmhurst Ballet School in 2002. In January 2003, The Royal Ballet School's older students (aged 16‚Äì19) moved to a newly constructed studio complex in Floral Street, adjacent to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, where The Royal Ballet remains the resident ballet company. A bridge was constructed between the school and the Opera House, linking the school with the theatre and The Royal Ballet Company's own studios. The designer of the bridge received an architectural award and it is known as the Bridge of Aspiration. White Lodge The Royal Ballet School's younger students moved to White Lodge, Richmond Park in Richmond, London in 1955 when the school was split for the first time. The Georgian building is a former royal residence and hunting lodge built during the reign of King George II. It is the School's permanent premises and there has been extensive redevelopment of the site to provide dance and academic facilities and accommodation for students. Children attend the school between the ages of 11-16 and entry to the school is by audition only. The school receives over twenty thousand applications every year and holds auditions in major UK cities. Having an international reputation, the school also receives applications from other countries. As a boarding school, the majority of students live on site, although there are a small number of day-students. In dance, students study classical ballet, character dance, contemporary, gymnastics, Irish, Morris and Scottish dancing. Later in their training, students study ballet repertoire, solos and pas de deux and boys undertake upper body conditioning. The school offers academic study at the level of a typical secondary school, both at Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4, with all students sitting GCSE examinations. Covent Garden Bridge of Aspiration linking the Royal Ballet Upper School on the left with the Royal Opera House, designed by Flint & Neill and Buro Happold with WilkinsonEyre The Royal Ballet School's Covent Garden base was established in 1955, when the younger students were moved to White Lodge. The school remained at existing studios in Barons Court, London, with academic studies introduced for the first time. Later in 2003, the school relocated to new premises, and the former Baron's Court site now houses the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. The school relocated to new, purpose-built premises in Covent Garden in January 2003. The complex is a four-storey building with six dance studios, including a studio theatre with retractable raked seating for an audience of 200. The building also houses changing rooms and showers for male and female students, a gym and fitness room, a pilates studio, physiotherapy suite and students common room. Facilities for academic education include four classrooms, a library with computer equipment, an art studio and audiovisual suite. All the dance studios are linked to the audiovisual suite so that classes and rehearsals can be filmed as a training tool, enabling the dancers to analyse themselves. Alongside a timetable of intensive ballet training, students also study pas de deux, solos, repertoire, character, contemporary dance, stagecraft, make-up, and body conditioning. 3rd year students get many opportunities throughout the year to train with The Royal Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet. Royal Ballet School, curtain call, Royal Ballet, 2007 Performances Each year The Royal Ballet School presents its Summer Performances, featuring students from all age groups in a wide variety of classical and contemporary works. The highlight of the school's dance year is the annual matin√©e at the Royal Opera House, which showcases graduate students before they embark on their professional careers as well as featuring students from all years of the school. The programme includes new works and heritage pieces from the Royal Ballet repertory and culminates in a grand d√©fil√©, in which every student of the school appears on stage in a choreographed curtain call. Prima ballerina assoluta The Royal Ballet School is unique in having trained four of only a small number of dancers in history to have been recognised as prima ballerina assoluta, the ultimate honorary title for a ballerina. Exclusively trained at The Royal Ballet School and dancing her entire professional career with The Royal Ballet, Margot Fonteyn was appointed prima ballerina assoluta of the company by Queen Elizabeth II in 1979. Having trained at The Royal Ballet School from 1959 to 1966, Eva Evdokimova would go on to become an international guest ballerina, being recognised as a prima ballerina assoluta following her performances with the Kirov Ballet in the late 1970s. The title was later recognised officially by the German Senate. Phyllis Spira began training at the Royal Ballet School in 1959, joining the Royal Ballet touring company in 1960. Choosing to shun an international ballet career, she returned to her native South Africa, where she danced the majority of her career with CAPAB ballet, today's Cape Town City Ballet. She was appointed prima ballerina assoluta by the State President of South Africa in 1984. Most recently, Royal Ballet School graduate Alessandra Ferri was appointed prima ballerina assoluta of La Scala Theatre Ballet in 1992. Citing Alessandra Ferri as prima ballerina assoluta of La Scala Another British ballerina, Alicia Markova, was also tutored by Royal Ballet School founder Ninette de Valois, and would go on to be a leading ballerina with the Ballets Russes, the first Prima Ballerina of The Royal Ballet, a founder ballerina with American Ballet Theatre, and co- founder of English National Ballet who now recognise her as the company's prima ballerina assoluta. Although not trained at The Royal Ballet School, this direct connection with school founder Ninette de Valois brings the total up to five.

Early life Born in Abilene, Texas, Floyd played his high school football in Midlothian, Texas, for the Midlothian Panthers. Midlothian named a stadium in his honor, but built a new one. Until 2018, Don Floyd stadium was used primarily as a practice field, which brought much criticism from Midlothian citizens. The road which runs next to the new Midlothian stadium is named in his honor. Also, in 2018, the field at MISD Multipurpose Stadium was named for him. Floyd earned All America honors at Texas Christian University (TCU), played on offense and defense, and helped TCU to two conference championships and two bowl appearances. Professional career After being a draft choice of both the Baltimore Colts of the National Football League (NFL) and the Houston Oilers of the AFL in 1960, Floyd signed with Houston in the fledgling AFL. He was selected as a defensive end on the American Football League All- League team in 1961 and 1962, and an AFL Eastern Division All-Star in 1963. In the early 1960s, Floyd was among the best, using a combination of strength and speed to establish a presence to be accounted for by the opposition on every play. He played in four American Football League Championships, helping the Oilers win the league's first two titles in 1960 and 1961. Don Floyd is on the Oilers' All-Time Team. Death On March 9, 1980, while traveling with a friend through Raymondville on his way to Houston, Floyd began to experience chest pain. Floyd's friend took him to Willacy County Hospital in Raymondville, where a nurse instructed the pair to drive to a hospital in Harlingen, 30 miles away. On the drive toward Harlingen, Floyd died of a heart attack. Surviving family members, including three former wives, sued the on- duty physician, the emergency room nurse and the hospital in Raymondville. Subsequent investigation determined that the nurse at Willacy County Hospital had been told to send all patients to the Harlingen hospital except in true life-and-death emergencies. The nursing board disciplinary hearing against the nurse and subsequent legal challenges to it (Lunsford v. Board of Nurse Examiners) established that nurses have a nurse-patient relationship and a duty to act when a patient comes to an emergency room, even if the patient has never been seen by the hospital or one of its physicians.

The nightclub Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n was a facility that held concerts and events. It was located on 3060-3066-3070 Bartolom√© Mitre in the Balvanera neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. It was operated by Omar Chab√°n, and opened on 12 April 2004, with a concert of the same band who played the day of the fire: Callejeros. The club was in a two story building, with a main entrance with six doors behind it leading into the main area of the nightclub, on the night of the fire four of the six doors were locked. There was also a connection to a nearby hotel, an emergency exit that was locked, and another emergency exit that was blocked by a fence in front of the stage. Fire safety measures in the building were extremely lacking with no reports of a fire detection or alarm system, emergency lighting, and fire suppression with ten of the fifteen fire extinguishers were depressurized and unusable. The nightclub's fire safety license had run out the previous month. Fire The venue was hosting rock group Callejeros and around 3,000 people were in attendance, which was double the venue's capacity of 1,500. The blaze was started when a pyrotechnic flare (a popular device in New Year's Eve celebrations) was set off and ignited foam in the ceiling. The materials used in the building for decoration were flammable: mostly wood, styrofoam, acoustic panels and a plastic net (media sombramedia sombra ‚Äì images). This plastic net was hung from the ceiling and caught fire first, melting into a rain of fire. In some parts of the building, teddy bear stuffing was used as a cheap alternative to wool fiber. The owner and the band's lead singer had told the patrons not to use flares inside the building. Four of the six doors, some of which were fire exits, were chained shut so that \\"people would not enter without paying\\", according to Mayor An√≠bal Ibarra. Most of the victims died from inhaling poisonous gases, and carbon monoxide. After the fire the technical institution INTI found that the level of toxicity, due to the materials and volume of the building was 225 ppm of cyanide in the air. A lethal dose for rats is between 150 ppm and 220 ppm, meaning the air in the building was highly toxic. Many of the victims were identified to be in their teens and 20s, but rescue workers clearing the club also found children and babies. This is potentially due to survivor accounts that a bathroom inside the nightclub had been used as a nursery, where parents could leave their children for the show. Aftermath Following the disaster, an Argentine judge issued a national and international arrest order against Omar Chab√°n, local businessman and owner of Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n and other nightclubs, including one called Cemento that had been closed by court orders many times before. Chab√°n was located at one of his houses in the neighbourhood of Montserrat and was arrested. Police are still seeking those responsible for setting off the flare, the guilty parties could face eight to twenty years in prison. President N√©stor Kirchner decreed three days of national mourning, and city authorities forbade concerts and closed all nightclubs in Buenos Aires during the mourning period, only to open again, one by one, after they had been checked and approved by the fire department. Pope John Paul II expressed his condolences to victims families in a message sent to officials in Argentine churches.  Tributes  The parents of many of the victims have worked to keep the victims memories alive, by planting 194 trees in honor of the deceased, and creating a traveling exhibit of the victims' photographs. A ceramics factory has donated memorial plaques to be dispersed across the country. Investigation It later became known that Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n had been overdue for a fire hazard inspection since late November 2004. Although Buenos Aires Mayor An√≠bal Ibarra blamed the Fire Department of the Argentine Federal Police (responsible for the inspections), several flaws in the city's inspection system soon surfaced. In addition to the city's poor planning for a disaster of this magnitude, critics pointed to Ibarra for failing to reorganize Buenos Aires' inspection system. A few days after the fire, Ibarra reshuffled the entire Buenos Aires security and emergency administration. The City Legislature announced that Mayor Ibarra was going to face a questioning session, but failed to achieve the necessary votes to force his questioning. Shortly thereafter, Ibarra voluntarily submitted to a questioning session, and announced a recall referendum to decide whether he would remain in office or not. Relatives and friends of the dead organized several marches to Plaza de Mayo demanding the resignation of An√≠bal Ibarra as Mayor of Buenos Aires, the conviction of Omar Chab√°n, and a more efficient inspection system. Some of these marches ended with incidents between protesters and the police. On 14 November 2005, an impeachment jury formed by the Buenos Aires Legislature suspended Mayor Ibarra for four months, pending an investigation of his performance that could lead to his removal. He accused the opposition of manipulating the families of Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n's victims in order to ruin his career. On 7 March 2006, after four months of deliberations, the impeachment jury voted to remove Ibarra from office. Trial A trial started on 19 August 2008 and finished 1 year later. The judges heard from over 300 witnesses, who claimed young fans has lit a flare that struck the ceiling, and it was revealed that the band was in charge of the concerts organization, security and entry into the club that night. But that the band was not at fault for the club being given a permit even though it lacked basic fire safety measures such as fire extinguishers, working emergency exits and nonflammable walls and ceilings. The defendants were sentenced as follows: *Omar Chab√°n: 20-year prison sentence *Ra√∫l Villarreal: 1-year suspended prison sentence *Callejeros: Acquitted, then retried in 2011: 11-year prison sentence (resentenced to 7 years in prison in 2012) *Diego Arga√±araz (manager of Callejeros): 18-year prison sentence *Fabiana Fiszbin (ex Control secretary): 2-year prison sentence *Ana Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez (ex Buenos Aires government servant): 2-year prison sentence *Subcommissioner Carlos D√≠az: 18-year prison sentence *Commissioner Miguel Belay: acquitted The band members of Los Callajeros were absolved in the 2009 trail, but the appeals court later found that they shared responsibility for the fire, in the 2011 ruling. Evidence to their complicity were witnesses statements that the band had encouraged the audience to fire flares.

Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Velankanni, Tamil Nadu Entrance Velankanni has one of the country's biggest Catholic pilgrimage centres, the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health. Devoted to Our Lady of Good Health, it is popularly known as the \\"Lourdes of the East\\". Its origins can be traced back to the 16th century. The church's founding is attributed to three miracles: the apparition of Mary and Jesus to a slumbering shepherd boy, the curing of a lame buttermilk vendor, and the survival of Portuguese sailors assaulted by a violent sea storm. It is built in the Gothic style, was modified by Portuguese and then further expanded later on due to the influx of pilgrims. The church building was raised to the status of basilica in 1962 by Pope John XXIII. Annually, 20 million pilgrims flock to the shrine from all over India and abroad, out which an estimated 3 million people visit the shrine during its annual festival from 29 August to 8 September.

The battle ended with a complete rout of the Pontic army and a decisive victory for the Romans. Forces King Mithridates VI  Pontic troops  One of Mithridates generals, Taxiles, and a large force were sent to join up with Archelaus and his forces in the Elatean plains. Baker cites a Roman army of less than 17,000 thousand, excluding allied troops, and the enemy Pontic army outnumbering those troops 5 to 1, or around 85,000 troops. Delbruck presents both a \\"supposed\\" figure of 120,000 troops and a reduced figure of a \\"more modest\\" 60,000 Asiatics. Delbruck further makes comments on the available primary sources and specifically refers to \\"vague and boastful\\" memoirs of Sulla which were the primary source that other historians of the time used, such as Plutarch. Hammond preferred the figure of 60,000 soldiers, which is supplied by Memnon of Heraclea. The Pontic forces are also said to have had 90 scythed chariots.Plutarch Life of Sulla 15 Mithridates' armies were a compound make-up of Greek and Oriental elements, the infantry was made up of Macedonian style phalanxes, with Pontic phalangists for missile units, and the cavalry a combination of horse and scythe-wheeled chariots.  Sulla's troops  Sulla's forces are approximated to have been around 30,000 men, with Baker commenting that of these less than 17,000 were Romans and the rest were composed of Macedonian and Greek allies. Baker, however, doesn't give a concrete value for the number of Macedonian and Greek soldiers involved in the battle, merely noting a disparity of \\"over three to one\\" between the Roman and Pontic troops once the allies are accounted for. The Roman forces were composed of veteran Roman legions and some cavalry. Geography Sulla advanced his army from Athens and into Boeotia, where he met up with Hortensius, who had advanced southward from Thessaly, at Philoboetus. Hortensius himself had moved through the mountains with a guide, intent on avoiding an ambush. Baker remarks that this movement put Sulla in a favourable position, his supplies were secure, wood and water were plentiful, the roads into Thessaly could be watched and guarded with ease, and the hills provided an advantage. Baker describes this position as \\"commanding the Elatean plain and the valley of Cephisus.\\" Sulla was determined to dictate the time and place of the battle. Taxiles and his large force had to go north through a defile, before turning into the narrower valley, between Orchomenos and Chaeronea to meet up with Archelaus and his forces. The consequence of this was that once Taxiles and his forces arrived, it became impossible for the forces to retreat and instead had to stand and fight. This force was encamped in the valley in a position which allowed the commanders to watch the Roman army. Archelaus intended to pursue a war of attrition, Taxiles with his far larger force, however, was determined to defeat the Romans in battle and insisted on an engagement and, given the circumstances, Archelaus was in no position to refuse.  Prelude  The Pontic forces, encamped in the valley, sent out numerous foraging parties which plundered and burned the countryside. Sulla was unable to defend the region with his far smaller force and instead was forced to stay camped up on the hill. Instead of remaining idle, Sulla ordered his men to dig entrenchments on the flanks to protect against possible envelopment by cavalry and also ordered the construction of palisades in the front to defend against the chariots. The exercise was twofold in intention, first Sulla sought to ensure the discipline of his soldiers and second, he hoped to tire the soldiers out so that they were more willing to battle. When his troops came to him requesting battle, Sulla challenged the men, citing that their new found will to fight was a response to inherent laziness to work, to occupy the hill of Parapotamii. The men agreed to this task, Archelaus had already marked the position for his own men and it became a race between Archelaus' and Sulla's men to occupy the position first. Baker describes this position as \\"almost impregnable\\", the occupier had no choice but to turn eastward towards Chaeronea to advance and if action took place here, one army or the other would be fighting at an angle.  Order of battle  For Rome, Sulla was in command of the right flank of the Roman army, the legate Murena on the left, Hortensius and Galba commanded the reserve cohorts in the rear with Hortensius on the left and Galba on the right. Finally, Gabinius and one full legion were sent to occupy the town of Chaeronea itself. For Mithridates, Archelaus was in command. Battle Sulla opened the engagement with an apparent retreat, he left one unit under Gabinius to occupy and defend the town of Chaeronea, had Murena retreat back onto Mount Thurium, while he himself marched alongside the right bank of the river Cephisus. Archelaus in response marched forth to occupy a position facing Chaeronea and extended a flanking force to occupy Murena's troops at Thurium. Sulla linked up with Chaeronea and extended the Roman line across the valley. Murena's position was the weakest, possibly untenable, to strengthen the position Gabinius recruited some of the locals to help deal with the danger, a proposition which Sulla approved. By this point, Sulla had taken up his position on the right and the battle began. Lucius Cornelius Sulla Murena, assisted by the force of natives from Chaeronea, cautiously launched an attack against the right flank, the flank having been attacked from above is forced down the hill with disastrous consequences and possibly up to 3,000 casualties there. In exchange the chariots charged forth against Gabinius who was in the centre, Gabinius withdrew his troops behind defensive stakes thus forcing the chariots to retreat. As the chariots retreated they were met by a barrage of Roman javelins and arrows causing confusion and rendering Archelaus' main infantry line of phalanx vulnerable to attack. The entrenched Roman legions were then pitched in a battle against the Macedonian style phalanx troops in the centre with missile support in the form of stones and bolts coming from the rear. The phalanx, unable to put up a full charge, engaged the Roman legions. Despite this, the Romans still had to contend against pike phalanx units with their own short swords. In order for the troops to use their short-sword they had to swat away the opposing pikes with their bare hands before drawing themselves near enough to attack. In the meantime, Archelaus continued extending his line rightward to outflank Murena on the Roman left wing. Hortensius, with the reserve cohorts under his command, came to Murena's rescue, but Archelaus, with 2,000 cavalry, promptly wheeled and pushed him back to the foothills, whence Hortensius's force stood isolated and in danger of being annihilated. Seeing this, Sulla raced across the field with his cavalry from the Roman right, which was not yet engaged, forcing Archelaus to withdraw. The Pontic commander now took the opportunity to ride against the weakened Roman right, left vulnerable by Sulla's absence, and at the same time left Taxiles with the bronze-shields to continue the attack on Murena, who was now exposed due to the retreat of Hortensius. Sending Hortensius with 4 cohorts to reinforce Murena, Sulla quickly returned to the right, bringing one cohort from Hortensius' force and another two from (presumably) the other reserve under Galba. The Romans there were resisting well, and when Sulla arrived they broke through the Pontic line and pursued them towards the Cephissus river and mount Akontion. The centre began advancing forward being led by Gabinius who was slaughtering the enemy troops. Seeing that Murena on the opposite wing was also successful, Sulla ordered a general advance. The entire Pontic army routed, and the commander Taxiles fell into Roman hands, while Archelaus escaped with what remained of his force to Chalcis. It was said that only 10,000 Pontic soldiers were able to save themselves, and although this is probably an exaggeration their losses must have nonetheless been substantial. Sulla reported that 100,000 of Archelaus' troops were killed, that 14 of his own were missing at the end of the battle and that two of those made it back by the next day. These figures are, however, called into question as being wholly unconvincing. Despite the odds, however, the Romans had emerged victorious. Aftermath In the immediate aftermath of the battle Sulla erected a trophy which he dedicated to the Roman gods Mars, for delivering victory to Rome, and also to Venus, in the spirit of fortune for the luck granted to the Romans. Archelaeus fled to the island of Euboea and immediately started using the fleet stationed there to harass his opponents naval traffic and sending raids against the Romans and their allies.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 77. When Sulla arrived at Thebes he held victory games, during which he may have been made aware of the approach of Lucius Valerius Flaccus who had recently landed in Epirus. Flaccus and Sulla met at Melitaea in Thessaly, though neither army made a move, both armies set up camp and waited for the other to attack. No attack came, and after some time Flaccus' soldiers began to desert in favour of Sulla, at first slowly but with time in increasing numbers, eventually Flaccus had to break camp or lose his entire army. Meanwhile, Archelaeus, who had wintered on the Island of Euboea, was reinforced by 80,000 men brought over from Asia Minor by Dorylaeus, another of Mithridates' generals. The Mithridatic army then embarked and sailed to Chalcis from where they marched back into Boeotia. Both Sulla and Flaccus were aware of these developments, so, rather than waste Roman troops to fight each other, Flaccus took his soldiers and headed for Asia Minor while Sulla turned back to face Archelaus once again. Sulla moved his army a few miles to the east of Chaeronea and into position near Orchomenos, a place he chose for its natural entrenchment. Here, Sulla once more, and once again outnumbered, faced off against Archelaus at the Battle of Orchomenus.

The player controls one of five planes in the airspace of the San Francisco Bay Area, which is shared with up to 600 artificially intelligent aircraft directed by real-time air traffic control. The game eschews the aerobatics focus of its predecessor, Flight Unlimited, in favor of general civilian aviation. As such, new physics code and an engine were developed, the former because the programmer of Flight Unlimiteds computational fluid dynamics system, Seamus Blackley, had left the company. The team sought to create an immersive world for the player and to compete with the Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Commercially, Flight Unlimited II performed well enough to recoup its development costs. Critics lauded the game's graphics and simulated airspace, and several praised its physics. However, some considered the game to be inferior to Microsoft Flight Simulator '98. Following the completion of Flight Unlimited II, its team split up to develop Flight Unlimited III (1999) and Flight Combat (later Jane's Attack Squadron) simultaneously. Both projects were troubled, and they contributed to the closure of Looking Glass in May 2000. Gameplay The player flies a Cessna 172 in IFR mode in the rain. Flight Unlimited II is a flight simulator video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real- world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane is based on its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed indicator, a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total. The game is set in a reproduction of 11,000 square miles of the San Francisco Bay Area. The player may land at or takeoff from the area's 46 airports. Weather conditions such as rain, wind and fog are simulated. Players share the game's airspace with up to 600 artificially intelligent (AI) planes, which fly and respond to the player in real-time. Real-time air traffic control (ATC) directs the player and the AI planes to prevent collisions. The player interacts with the ATC and with other planes by constructing radio messages with a menu. Three cockpit views are available: IFR (instrument flight rules), which allows the player to monitor and interact with all flight instruments; VFR (visual flight rules), which features a larger windshield area but fewer flight instruments; and Virtual Cockpit View, which allows free look but features no interactive flight instruments. External camera angles are also available, and the player may ride as a passenger in any AI plane. Development Following the completion of Flight Unlimited in 1995, project leader Seamus Blackley planned to use that game's computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) code to create a combat flight simulator called Flight Combat. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Studios demanded that Blackley instead design a direct sequel to Flight Unlimited. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. Constantine Hantzopoulos became the lead designer and project leader of the fourteen- member Flight Unlimited II team. The team eschewed the aerobatics focus of their previous game in favor of general civilian aviation, in order to compete with the Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Looking Glass announced the game on December 18, 1996. It was slated to include 6 planes, 45 airports and 8,500 square miles of terrain from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area was chosen because of its varied landscape and numerous airports. In January 1997, Eidos Interactive partnered with Looking Glass to provide the game's marketing and distribution. A distance fog algorithm (like the one demonstrated above) had been used to improve the frame rate of Flight Unlimited, but the ZOAR renderer developed for Flight Unlimited II made this unnecessary. The team opted not to reuse the technology of Flight Unlimited. Hantzopoulos learned from Blackley that it was necessary to recreate the \\"visceral feel\\" of real flight, but Blackley's CFDs system was \\"all black box spaghetti code\\" that the team could not understand. Programmer Jim Berry, who had previously worked on simulators such as Falcon 4.0, wrote new physics code based on force vector calculations to replace the CFDs system. To gather data for the new physics, Hantzopoulos and Berry flew in real-world planes with designer Ed Tatro and aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian. James Fleming coded Flight Unlimited IIs new terrain renderer, ZOAR. Flight Unlimited uses distance fog to limit visible terrain, but this causes pop-in issues that the team sought to avoid in the sequel. Instead of removing textures that exceed the draw distance, the new engine uses mipmapping to lower the polygon count of distant terrain. This increases the viewable area and allowed the team to use fog as an atmospheric effect, rather than as a \\"crutch\\". The team's goal was to create the \\"best, most realistic civilian flight simulator\\", which would provide an immersive world for the player. Radio communications between ATCs, AI planes and the player occur in real-time: a \\"sophisticated audio splicing system\\" gathers pre-recorded voice fragments into contextually appropriate sentences. The team recorded the engine noise of each of the game's planes, and they designed cockpits more interactive than those in Flight Unlimited. Roughly 300 times more terrain area was included in Flight Unlimited II than in its predecessor. To generate the terrain, the team combined digital elevation maps with satellite imagery rendered at four square meters per pixel. The images were taken at 9:30 am, because the long shadows provided an illusion of depth. 3D models were used for all buildings taller than nine stories. Because of the terrain detail, the game was the first to allow players to follow VFR. Initially, the team planned to include only VFR flight, but they later enabled IFR to \\"ease navigation\\". The team hoped to add more terrain and planes and a multiplayer feature after the game's release. The game was shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June 1997, alongside The Dark Project. At the show, the team detailed early plans to include missions. The game was well received, and Combatsim praised it as \\"the next level in civilian flight sims\\". Denny Atkin of Computer Gaming World liked the game, but he questioned Looking Glass's decision to compete in the civilian rather than the combat flight simulator market. That August, Looking Glass merged with Intermetrics, a technology company that hoped to branch into the video game industry. The merger came amid financial difficulties; a large portion of the Looking Glass staff was laid off during the middle of 1997. Looking Glass's Tim Stellmach and Paul Neurath described the merger as amicable, and the former noted that \\"through the whole deal everyone was really psyched about both The Dark Project and Flight Unlimited II\\". In September, Eidos took over publishing duties on Flight Unlimited II, as a result of Looking Glass's new business model with Intermetrics. The game was released on December 12, 1997. Reception Flight Unlimited II was placed in direct competition with the Microsoft Flight Simulator series and Sierra Entertainment's Pro Pilot, and it performed well enough to recoup its development costs. PC Gamer USs Stephen Poole commented that the limited environments of Flight Unlimited did not create a believable flight experience, but that the \\"exquisite terrain, impressive flight-physics models, and meticulous attention to the details and procedures of civilian aviation\\" in Flight Unlimited II created \\"the closest experience to actual flight\\" available. He praised the game's ATC system, which he considered to be \\"so real that it's almost scary\\". Poole summarized, \\"Flight Unlimited II is so impressive that to even whine about little details shows a shortsightedness that's all too common amongst us gamers.\\" Denny Atkin of Computer Gaming World believed the game to be the first simulator to recreate \\"the real feeling of civilian flying\\", particularly because of its graphics and ATC system. He considered its flight physics to be \\"much better than Pro Pilot, although not up to the level of Flight Simulator 98\\". He finished by calling Flight Unlimited II \\"a must-have for any general-aviation enthusiast.\\" John Nolan of Computer Games Magazine found that the new flight physics were \\"more than adequate for the task at hand\\", despite certain \\"questionable areas\\". He praised the graphics and ATC, but noted AI glitches with the latter. He summarized, \\"Overall, this simulation is somewhat above average\\". Dean Evans of PC Gamer UK called it \\"the best civilian flight sim we've ever seen\\", which makes \\"Flight Simulator look like a sack of old spam\\". He found the game to be \\"immensely realistic\\" and praised its terrain and simulated airspace. Similarly, Edge praised the believable and highly detailed environment, noting that Looking Glass Studios managed to cleverly soften the contrast between photo-captured textures and polygon objects \\"using haze as a real effect rather than a distance-clipping cheat\\". The magazine concluded that dismissing the game simply because of its lack of weapons \\"would be a mistake\\", and explained that the interaction with the world \\"is everything‚Äîit's reward enough simply to explore rather than to destroy.\\" PC Zones Paul Presley believed the game to be inferior to combat flight simulators and stated that it \\"isn't nearly as deep or varied as Microsoft's Flight Simulator '98\\". He found the graphics to be lackluster and the terrain to be \\"a bit empty\\", which he believed damaged the game's atmosphere. However, he noted that Flight Unlimited IIs \\"underlying playability\\" made it \\"worthwhile\\" and \\"addictive\\". Presley summarized, \\"[A]s a time-waster, a novelty item or an office toy, it does the job and it does it well.\\" Jonathan Gordon of The Independent wrote, \\"The original Flight Unlimited promised much but delivered relatively little, and it's a similar story with this sequel.\\" He noted that the graphics, while good from a distance, became \\"disappointingly bland\\" up close; and he found the game to be limited compared to Microsoft Flight Simulator '98. Flight Unlimited II was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1997 \\"Simulation Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Longbow 2. The editors called Flight Unlimited II \\"the first aviation sim to truly capture the environment of real civilian flying\\". Aftermath In April 1998, Looking Glass released a patch for Flight Unlimited II that included six new adventures, a new plane (the Fokker Dr.I) and an \\"Adventure Builder Kit\\", which allowed players to construct their own adventures and to share them online. The patch also added moving objects on the ground. After completing Flight Unlimited II, certain members of the game's team wanted to develop Flight Unlimited III, while others wanted to create Flight Combat. Looking Glass split the team in two and expanded both with new hires, so that the games could be developed simultaneously. Flight Unlimited III lead designer Peter James later wrote that his project's development was troubled, in part because of a lack of interest from company management. It became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial failures. Flight Combat (renamed Jane's Attack Squadron) struggled through a long and costly development cycle. Both projects contributed to Looking Glass's closure in May 2000. Mad Doc Software later completed Jane's Attack Squadron, and it was published by Xicat Interactive in March 2002.

A smaller, artificial island, Swinburne Island, lies immediately to the south. Created in 1873 upon the Orchard Shoal by the addition of landfill, the island is named for former New York City mayor (1866-1868) and New York Governor (1869-1871) John Thompson Hoffman. Quarantined persons on Hoffman Island between 1910 and 1915 During the late 1800s and early 1900s, Hoffman (and Swinburne) Island was used as a quarantine station, housing immigrants who, upon their arrival at the immigrant inspection station at nearby Ellis Island, presented with symptoms of contagious disease(s). World War II Starting in 1938 and extending through World War II, the United States Merchant Marine used Hoffman and Swinburne Islands as a training station.\\"The Ship That Never Sails.\\" Popular Mechanics, February 1942, pp.66-69/164. The Quonset huts built during this period are no longer evident on Hoffman Island, but as of 2017 their remnants remain on Swinburne Island. During World War II the islands also served as anchorages for Antisubmarine Nets intended to protect New York Bay and its associated shipping/naval activities from enemy submarines entering from the Atlantic Ocean. Post‚ÄìWorld War II Since World War II several proposals for utilizing Hoffman and Swinburne Islands have been presented. In the 1950s, city planner Robert Moses and political consultant Bernard Baruch advocated transforming the islands into a city park, but this plan was not realized. In 1961, all existing buildings on Hoffman Island were razed.Abandoned Man Made Islands in New York City Untapped Cities In the 1980s, in response to plans of New York City to open new homeless shelters amidst Staten Island's residential neighborhoods, some of the potentially affected residents proposed a never- implemented plan to construct a homeless shelter on Hoffman Island, Swinburne Island or both. Current use Hoffman and Swinburne islands are currently managed by the National Park Service as part of the Staten Island Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area. To protect the islands' avian residents, which include great egret, snowy egret, black-crowned night heron, glossy ibis, double-crested cormorant and great black-backed gull, the island is off limits to the public. Beginning in 2001, harbor seals have been observed wintering on and near the islands.

Du had Han Chinese ancestry. Born in Yongchang (now Baoshan, Yunnan), Du Wenxiu was the son of a Han Chinese who converted to Islam. His original name was Yang Xiu (Êù®ÁßÄ).http://www.shijiemingren.com/doc-view-27181.html, retrieved 31 Mar 2017 He styled himself \\"Sultan of Dali\\" and reigned for 16 years before Qing troops under Cen Yuying beheaded him after he swallowed a ball of opium. His body is entombed in Xiadui. The rebellion started after massacres of Hui perpetrated by the Manchu authorities. Du used anti-Manchu rhetoric in his rebellion against the Qing, calling for Han to join the Hui to overthrow the Manchu Qing after 200 years of their rule. Du invited the fellow Hui Muslim leader Ma Rulong to join him in driving the Manchu Qing out and \\"recover China\\". For his war against Manchu \\"oppression\\", Du \\"became a Muslim hero\\", while Ma Rulong defected to the Qing. On multiple occasions Kunming was attacked and sacked by Du Wenxiu's forces. He was the father of Du Fengyang, who also participated in the rebellion. In Kunming, there was a slaughter of 3,000 Muslims on the instigation of the judicial commissioner, who was a Manchu, in 1856. Du Wenxiu was of Han Chinese origin despite being a Muslim and he led both Hui Muslims and Han Chinese in his civil and military bureaucracy. Du Wenxiu was fought against by another Muslim leader, the defector to the Qing Ma Rulong. The Muslim scholar Ma Dexin, who said that Neo-Confucianism was reconcilable with Islam, approved of Ma Rulong defecting to the Qing and he also assisted other Muslims in defecting. Tribal pagan animism, Confucianism, and Islam were all legalized and \\"honoured\\" with a \\"Chinese-style bureaucracy\\" in Du Wenxiu's Sultanate.

History Buttero in the Campagna Romana, cyanotype from 1899 The buttero habitually rides a horse of one of the working breeds of the Maremma and the Roman Campagna ‚Äì the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale, the Maremmano, and the Tolfetano. He tends livestock, usually cattle (such as the native Maremmana breed), horses or buffaloes. Two saddles are in common use: the scafarda is the standard saddle in the Tuscan Maremma, while in Lazio the bardella is the saddle of choice; and older saddle, the sella col pallino, is no longer in common use. The buttero's attire consists of coarse cotton pants, leggings, a velvet jacket and a black hat. He protects himself from the rain with a large mantle called the pastr√†no. He carries the mazzarella, a stick employed for herding oxen and horses. They are still present in the memory of older Tuscans and in folk celebrations. On the day of Sant'Antonio Abate (January 17) for the benediction of the animals, they parade in the centers of Tarquinia, Tuscania, Marta, and Valentano. Butteri participate in the various fetes of the merca in Alberese, Blera, Monte Romano, Tarquinia, and Tuscania. In the merca held in April at the Roccaccia, not far from Tarquinia, after having branded the young calves born in the year, the butteri compete in games of ability. Solemn participation in various celebrations of Jesus Christ's Passion assumes particular color and vivacity in the procession of the Resurrected Christ held in Tarquinia in the late afternoon of Easter. The mounted butteri precede the statue through the crowd, firing salvoes with their maremmana shotguns. The life of the buttero of other times was not to be envied from a qualitative point of view: the hard job in the marshes of the Maremma began before dawn, with rounding up the herds on horseback. They would take a unique meal before midday: :We made loaf with bread and chicory accompanied (but not always) from a piece of ventresca or budellone. We picked up tomatoes, chicory, potatoes and ferlenghi for the acquacotta. At dusk, after the return to the barn, the only comfort was the rapazzola , a rudimentary bed, close to the beasts. The town was sometimes visited, for the inn, to warm up themselves with the wine of the wine cellar, to discuss livestock and to tune up a song \\"a braccio\\".  Roots in Northern Italian military history The image of the military mercenary of the 14th and 15th centuries in Northern Italy (called cavalieri) riding in suits of armor wielding the mazza (mace) persists in that of the buttero. Many pastoralists of Northern Italy found better pay as mercenaries of the period, but when unemployed returned to their pastoral lifestyle. They brought back their accoutrements of battle and adapted them, whimsically, to herding.  Current roles in Italian society  PButteri in southern Tuscany With only five or six large herds still tended by butteri today in the unspoiled national park of Maremma (the rest of Italy's livestock largely raised by commercial concerns), the tradition of the butteri is still relived outside the park in small demonstrations in the region's rural towns and in the Italian equivalent of rodeos. It is still possible to ride with the butteri as they check their cattle in the Parco Regionale della Maremma (Maremma regional park).  Buffalo Bill and the butteri  In 1890, Buffalo Bill took his Wild West show to Rome and northern Italy (during his tour of Europe) to display cowboy skills, such as the capture of young cattle and the taming of wild horses. Unimpressed, the Italian cowboys (the butteri) led by Augusto Imperiali challenged Buffalo Bill and his show to a contest of skill. As the story is told, the butteri proved far more experienced than the Buffalo Bill troupe, and the national moment of glory for the butteri was savored for many years.P. Romano, in the Strenna dei Romanisti of 1947, describes the episode as follows (in Italian):  Remembrance  The first Sunday in August in Tuscany still provides an annual festival to commemorate the skills of the butteri.  Existence outside of Italy  Italian emigrants to California brought the tradition of the buttero with them, where they called themselves cavalcanti. They brought with them skills in rounding up large herds of cattle, usage of the lasso, and horsemanship.

Like her friend and contemporary Ibaragi Noriko, she was openly critical of environmental devastation, war, and nuclear power. Some of her poems are used in Japanese language textbooks, and she is therefore one of the best-known contemporary poets in Japan. Biography Ishigaki was born in Akasaka, Tokyo in 1920. After she finished junior high school in 1934, she went to work for Industrial Bank of Japan. Her income sustained her aging family through World War II, and she never married. While working at the bank she joined a literary group, and she began to write poems. In 1959 she published her first collection, \\"In front of me the saucepan and pot and burning flame and...\\" In 1968 she published her second, \\"Nameplate and other works.\\" This book won the annual Mr. H Award (H-shi-sho, HÊ∞èË≥û) in 1969, which is given to the best book of poetry by a new Japanese poet published in the previous year. In those days it was uncommon for a woman to work full-time in Japan, and she was sometimes referred to as 'the bank clerk poet'. She published four collections of her own poetry, as well as edited two anthologies which contained both her own works and others', and wrote some books in which she expressed her opinions and told her life story. Her best known work is \\"Nameplate.\\" This was based on two experiences where she stayed in a hospital room and at an inn. At the entrance to those two rooms her name was displayed with the honorific words Sama and Dono. This is often done and most people don't mind it or consider it something unnecessary, but these honorifics made her uneasy. She began the poem \\"To the place where I live in/it is best to put my nameplate by myself\\", and then told of her two experiences. If she allows someone to put up a nameplate for her, then she can't deny the adding of an honorific word. She continued \\"Then will I be able to deny it?\\" But she denied any honorific addition for herself. \\"Also where you put a base for your spirit,/ you must put a nameplate for yourself / Ishigaki Rin / that's good for me.\\" Later she wrote in an afterword of one of her books, \\"I was born to create one work, Nameplate.\\"  Works = Poetry books  *ÁßÅ„ÅÆÂâç„Å´„ÅÇ„ÇãÈçã„Å®„ÅäÈáú„Å®ÁáÉ„Åà„ÇãÁÅ´„Å®, 1959. 1st book: The Pan, the Pot, the Burning Fire I Have in Front of Me *Ë°®Êú≠„Å™„Å©, 1968. 2nd book: Nameplate and other works *Áï•Ê≠¥, 1979. 3rd book: Curriculum Vitae *„ÇÑ„Åï„Åó„ÅÑË®ÄËëâ, 1984. 4th book: Tender words  External links  *Janine Beichman's translation of \\"Nameplates\\" *Poetry International Web-Rin Ishigaki 1920 births 2004 deaths People from Tokyo 20th-century Japanese poets ","title":"Ishigaki Rin"},{"id":"1347700","text":"Halstead is a village and civil parish in the Sevenoaks District of Kent, England.

It is in the North Maine Woods region and borders the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument on the east. The park was established by 28 donations of land, in trust, from park donor Percival P. Baxter between the years of 1931 and 1962, eventually creating a park of over in size. Baxter Park is not part of the Maine State Park system. Sole governance is provided by the Baxter State Park Authority, consisting of the Maine Attorney General, the Maine Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the Director of the Maine Forest Service. The park is independently funded through a combination of revenues from trusts, user fees, and the sale of forest products from the park's Scientific Forest Management Area. The park is home to the state's highest peak, Mount Katahdin. The number of visitors to the park declined from 75,000 in 2000 to 55,000 in 2005, but since 2005 visitor use has been slowly increasing. In 2018, the gate counts were 67,774. Geography and climate Katahdin consists of a cluster of mountains. The highest peak, Baxter Peak, is named after park donor and former Maine Governor Percival P.

Numerous streams and rivers connect these water bodies, most prominently Trout Brook (between Grand Lake Matagamon and Nesowadnehunk Lake) and Nesowadnehunk Stream (connecting Nesowadnehunk Lake and the small collection of ponds near Sentinel Mountain). Some of these have waterfalls; Nesowadnehunk Stream has Big and Little Niagara Falls, as well as Ledge Falls. Wassataquoik Stream has two waterfalls, Grand and Norway; another popular waterfall is Green Falls, tucked between Bald Mt. and South Pogy Mt. None of this water is potable, and the park advises that visitors bring or treat their water. The climate of Baxter State Park lies within the Northern Forest Region of the American continent and experiences the cool, moist climate typical of this region. The annual mean temperature is ; the record high temperature is , and the record low stands at . The average annual precipitation is which includes per year of snow. Summer temperatures and conditions peak in the park in July and August; fall foliage colors begin to emerge in early September and peak in late September or early October. Leaf-fall in deciduous trees is complete by the end of October. Lasting snowfall usually begins in mid-to-late November, and lasts through April. Leaves emerge on deciduous trees around the last week of May. Weather in Baxter State Park can be characterized primarily by its variability; snowfall can occur any month of the year, and temperatures can and do fluctuate widely around the averages. Wildlife Baxter State Park has a diverse population of wildlife, the most common of which are the moose, the black bear, and the white-tailed deer. These animals are most active during the summer months and can sometimes be seen from the road. The many marshes and bogs of the park serve as habitats for such animals as beavers, muskrats, river otters, and raccoons. There are several active beaver colonies within the park's perimeters. Wooded areas of the park support other types of wildlife, including bobcats, fishers, martens, weasels, chipmunks, red squirrels, snowshoe hares, coyotes, lemmings, and red foxes. There is also an avian population in the park; the most common birds are warblers, thrushes, and flycatchers as well as owls, hawks, eagles, and ducks and other wetland birds. History In 1920, eventual Governor Percival P. Baxter participated in an expedition to the top of Mount Katahdin, led by Burton Walter Howe (then- chairman of the Aroostook county Republican party), to determine its feasibility for the site of a national park. The expedition included not only Baxter, the presumptive choice for President of the Senate, but also Charles P. Barnes, who was widely regarded as the leading candidate for Speaker of the House of Representatives of Maine when it convened in January 1921. The expedition‚Äôs guide was Roy Dudley, the long-time game warden at Chimney Pond. After assuming the Maine Senate presidency during the state's 80th legislative session, Percival Baxter appointed his brother Rupert, a Senator from Sagadahoc County, to the Committee on State Lands and Forest Preservation, which would be considering legislation that would create a state park at Katahdin. Baxter introduced on January 25, 1921 ‚ÄúAN ACT to Establish the Mt. Katahdin State Park‚Äù (80th Legislature, Senate No. 19). The unexpected death of Governor Frederick H. Parkhurst on January 31, 1921 triggered Senate President Baxter‚Äôs elevation to the governorship. This unforeseen development dramatically changed the political fortunes of Baxter's park proposal. William F. Dawson's illustrated lecture, scheduled by Baxter for February 2, 1921, was cancelled, and in its stead legislators were filing past Parkhurst‚Äôs coffin laid out in the Capitol‚Äôs rotunda. Baxter, the newly inaugurated governor, was no longer able to direct legislative deliberations on his bill. With failed legislation, Baxter started to use his personal wealth to purchase land and pieced together the park by himself. His first action was a purchase from the Great Northern Paper Company in 1930. He officially donated that parcel to the State of Maine in 1931 with a condition that the park be kept as wild in perpetuity. Baxter continued more purchases in his 32-year mission. He made the last purchase in 1962 and accumulated of wilderness. Since Gov. Baxter's death in 1969, the park has been increased to a total of , including the 2006 addition of a parcel of and spectacular Katahdin Lake. Park Headquarters is located over from the actual park in the small town of Millinocket. There are no stores or gas stations inside the park. Access and use are strictly regulated in accordance with Gov. Baxter's expressed desire to keep the park \\"forever wild.\\" Baxter wrote of the area: \\"Man is born to die, his work short lived; buildings crumble, monuments decay, wealth vanishes, but Katahdin, in all its glory, shall forever remain the mountain of the people of Maine. Throughout the ages it will stand as an inspiration to the men and women of the state.\\"Percival P. Baxter, quoted in \\"Katahdin Section Guide to The Appalachian Trail in Maine\\" Pockwockamus RockIn 1979, volunteers in the Maine Youth Conservation Corps created the mural on Pockwockamus Rock, located about 2.5 miles from the south gate (). John W. Hakola (1928‚Äì1995), a history professor at the University of Maine, wrote a history of Baxter State Park (published in 1981). Features One of several lean-to shelters at Chimney Pond, reachable only by trail Inside the park boundary there is no electricity, running water, or paved roads. In keeping with the \\"Forever Wild\\" philosophy expressed by Gov. Baxter, the park prohibits the use of audio or visual devices in any way that impairs the enjoyment of the park by others or that may disturb or harass wildlife. Winter hiking and camping regulations have been recently revised to provide more freedom for park visitors, coupled with a clear understanding that park visitors must take responsibility for their safety in the often unforgiving winter environment of the park. The park is open to overnight summer camping from May 15 to October 15 and winter camping from December 1 to March 31. Only northbound long distance Appalachian Trail hikers can stay in the park without reservations; they are limited to one night's stay at The Birches camping area, which is limited to the first twelve hikers to sign in at an information kiosk several southbound trail miles away just inside the park's southern boundary. In addition to hiking and camping, approximately 25% of the park is open to hunting and trapping (with the exception of moose hunting). Park ponds and streams are open to either fly fishing or general law fishing as determined by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the Baxter State Park Authority. Snowmobiling is permitted on the Tote Road, the dirt road connecting the park's south gate at Togue Pond and the north gate at Matagamon. The park also includes a Scientific Forest Management Area of located in its northwest corner. Park donor Percival Baxter directed that this area be managed for exemplary forest management. The area has been under active management for over 20 years and conducts sustainable, Forest Stewardship Council-certified management. Police protection within the park is provided by the park's Law Enforcement Ranger staff and local Maine IF&W; Wardens. Fire protection provided by the Maine Forest Service; waste disposal and recycling is addressed through the park's Carry-In, Carry-Out policy. Maintenance is done by the many volunteer workers and paid employees of the park. The current Park Director is Eben Sypitkowski.

It is south of the county town Shrewsbury and located on the main A49 road, the Shrewsbury to Hereford road. Occupied continuously since before the Middle Ages, the village had a population of 5,079 residents in 2,172 households in the 2011 census. Bayston Hill mainly serves as a dormitory village for nearby Shrewsbury. It has the largest population for a village in Shropshire and the 10th highest population of any Shropshire locality. The village has a larger than average retired population in comparison to many similar Shropshire villages, but lower than the national average. Bayston Hill has three public houses, two churches (Church of England and Methodist), one primary school called Oakmeadow, and a public library. Lyth Hill lies to the south of the village. History=Early history There is remaining evidence of both an ancient British Iron Age hillfort and a Roman settlement located on the village's high grounds. In the Middle Ages the heavily wooded Bayston Hill and Condover area was established as a Royal hunting forest. A busy rope works, complete with its own windmill built in 1835, existed on Lyth Hill in the 19th century, supplying the many mines, farms and barge owners across the district. A church was built alongside the village glebelands in 1843 to serve the local miners, quarrymen and railway navvies. Standing on the east side is the village's oldest archaeological site: a mounded Iron Age bivallate hill fort, relatively low lying for such a structure and oddly named with the Danish name of The Burgs, but probably was not called that until sometime between the 14th and 16th centuries. The village was surveyed for the Domesday Book during the year 1086, when it was called Begestan. William Pantulf, an Anglo-Norman nobleman, held land there. Buildings Great Lyth manor house was built in 1638 but had fallen into dereliction by 1948. In recent years it has been rescued and renovated. The present Lord of Wrentnall, Baron of Pulverbatch, is also the present Lord of Great Lyth. {Farrow, M. MA Cantab, Barony of Pulverbatch, Manors of Pulverbatch, Wrentnall, Great Lyth, Baron of Pulverbatch is R. SPRULES, 7 April 2003, copies at The British Library}. In 1785 the London architect George Steuart designed and built a brick mansion house, Lythwood Hall for the Blakeway family, which was accessed via a sweeping driveway through landscaped gardens to the west of the village. Steuart went on to build Attingham Hall for the 1st Lord Berwick but Lythwood Hall fell into disrepair under the squireship of the Hulton-Harrop family in the 1890s. It was later split into multi-ownership units. Bayston Hill was established as a new ecclesiastical parish with the building of Christ Church in 1843 as an amalgamation of sections from the parishes of St. Julian's Shrewsbury, Meole Brace and nearby Condover. The church was built to serve the local miners, quarrymen and railway navvies. The ecclesiastical parish is part of the Diocese of Lichfield. Modern history Although the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway (now the Welsh Marches Line), runs straight past the village, Bayston Hill has never had its own railway station. The 1920s novels House in Dormer Forest and Seven for a Secret were written at Spring Cottage, Lyth Hill by romantic novelist Mary Webb, who lived near the village on and off for ten years, alternating between Spring Cottage and her London home, until her death in 1927. The action in her most famous novel Precious Bane took place around the nearby Bomere Pool, that she called Sarn Mere. The oldest known ghost in Shropshire, a dead Roman soldier, is also reputed to haunt Bomere Pool, the site of a Roman army camp and its associated civilian settlement. A further literary connection can be found in the Brother Cadfael medieval detective novels of Ellis Peters, with much of the action in several stories taking place within the traditional forest, lanes and footpaths in and around Bayston Hill, or between the village and other surrounding medieval settlements. The village became a civil parish in the reorganisation of 1967. The original 1843 Christ Church church building still stands. A modern successor church was built on a more central site for the newer housing estates in the early 1980s. In 2001 an application to further extend the Bayston Hill quarry was turned down, after a detailed survey identified six previously unknown historical sites of archaeological importance that would be destroyed by the proposed extension. These included sections of at least one or possibly two AD 43‚Äì450 Roman roads, two 1066-1547 medieval or mid 16th century post-medieval roads or trackways, a group of cropmarks suggesting historical earthworks or buildings, and a group of three medieval parish boundary stones. In August 2003, the section of the A5 road at Bayston Hill was closed, after a large black cat was claimed to have been sighted at the service station. Experts from the West Midlands Safari Park assisted a police helicopter in search for the cat, which was not found.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/3178981.stm In early 2012 plans to change Bayston Hill's status to a town were abandoned, following concerns by residents. The plans would have seen a Mayor and Deputy Mayor appointed. Governance=Parish The village has a parish council, which contains 15 elected councillors, currently chaired by ex-Indian Army officer, and Amnesty International campaigner James Moraghen. In early 2008 the council took the radical step of appointing two young persons aged between 14 and 18 to represent the views of the village youth at council meetings. County The village is part of a Shropshire Council electoral division that returns 3 members to Shirehall. This division is made up of Bayston Hill, Column and Sutton, with a total population at the 2011 Census of 11,982. The current members are Ted Clarke, Liz Parsons and Jon Tandy. With an electorate of over 11,000, the division is the only one in the county to return 3 members. Westminster The village is part of the Shrewsbury and Atcham constituency. Daniel Kawczynski of the Conservatives is the current Member of Parliament representing the constituency. Geography Berries Lane Bayston Hill stands on an outcropping spur, of a Pre-Cambrian limestone and sandstone sedimentary rock extension of the Longmyndian range, intruding into the Shropshire plain, with major appearances at Longden, Lyth Hill, Bayston Hill, and Sharpstone Hill. North of the River Severn it does not outcrop again until it appears east of Shrewsbury as Haughmond Hill. The sediments were laid down under a vast warm ocean, surrounded by many volcanoes that were ground down by later Ice Age glaciers, which provided the fertile soil that contributed to Bayston Hill becoming a successful farming community throughout medieval times. There are still several active geological fault lines underlying the area; on 2 April 1990 Bayston Hill experienced an earthquake, measuring 5.4 on the Richter Scale, that was centred on Bishop's Castle. The village lies just three miles south of Shrewsbury, and is separated from the county town by the main A5 Trunk road. It has good road transport links, with easy access to both the A49 and A5. To the south lies the pre-Cambrian Lyth Hill, with Sharpstone Hill standing to the east, the latter now mostly a major sandstone quarry with little of the hill itself now remaining after several hundred years of constant quarrying activities.Sharpstone Hill Demography Housing in Bayston Hill on Glebe Road. According to the 2001 census, there were 2,103 households containing a population of 5,247, which makes Bayston Hill the most populated village in Shropshire and larger than many of its market towns (such as Church Stretton or Much Wenlock). In 2011, census data showed the number of dwellings increased to 2,172 while the population fell to 5,079. A total of 1,236 residents (24.3%) are aged 65 or over. The majority of residents identify as only English. Of the 2,146 recorded households in 2001, only 630 had dependent children. Half of the 1,905 owner-occupiers own their own homes outright, with the remainder still having mortgages. Of the 2,919 residents in gainful employment, 264 work exclusively from home, and of those who travel to places of work, 77 cycle, 132 walk, 170 take the bus, and vast majority of 1,966 travel by motor vehicle. A 2003 housing survey identified that 96 percent of village homes were owner occupied, compared to a borough and national average of only 74 percent. There is a current under-provision of social and housing association properties, particularly in the one-bed and two-bed market for new family starter and retirement housing. It is felt that building of new housing has to be balanced against a general desire amongst residents to keep the village at close to its current size, and prevent further overspill towards Shrewsbury. Facilities A49, is one of three pubs in Bayston Hill. The village facilities include a Women's Institute, the Mary Webb Library which is open all day on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and Saturday mornings, and a large doctors' surgery The Beeches Medical Practice. The village hall, known as Bayston Hill Memorial Hall, was built as a war memorial to local men who died serving in World War I, who are listed on a Roll of Honour inside the building, and also honours those who died in World War II, whose names are listed on plaques either side of the main entrance. There are two churches in the village. Christ Church, near Oakland School on Glebe Road, is an evangelical Anglican parish and fellowship church. Bayston Hill Methodist Church is on Lansdowne Road. Within the village are three public houses, The Three Fishes, the Compasses Inn and The Beeches. The Beeches is the only one in the newer part of Bayston Hill; the other two are on the older side of the village on the A49. Another pub on this road, The Fox, was demolished in August 2012 and replaced with housing. Unlike many modern rural villages, Bayston Hill has managed to retain a compact and busy central parade of shops, that include a post office and newsagents, a supermarket, a fish & chip shop, a greengrocers, a baker and a family butchers. The village is also served by a ladies hairdressers and several mobile home hairdressers. The Village Association organises several well- supported annual events, an annual Christmas carol concert at the parade, and distributes a free monthly newsletter publication known as the \\"Villager\\" to every village household, which contains useful information about local events and amenities. Education There is no secondary school in the village, with children over the age of eleven attending a range of secondary schools in the rest of Shrewsbury or Church Stretton. There were two primary schools in the village, Longmeadow and Oakland Primary Schools. Falling pupil numbers led to local discussions about amalgamating the schools. The idea was supported by some and opposed by others in the community.Campaign to save Oakland School In September 2008 the statutory notices were formally served by Shropshire County Council and the Diocese of Lichfield, stating their intent to discontinue both Oakland and Longmeadow schools as from 31 August 2009. The Diocese of Lichfield was invited to establish a new Church of England school in Bayston Hill on 1 September 2009. After a vote, the new establishment was named Oakmeadow and its uniform purple. The children of junior age are educated on the old Longmeadow site, and originally infants at were to be educated at the Oakland site. However, the Longmeadow site has been extended to house the whole school, and residents have indicated a preference for the Oakland site to be used by the community. The Oakland site remains closed, and as of 2020 remains undeveloped and is decaying rapidly.

It was the second of the revamped Bulldog Drummond films (following 1967's Deadlier Than the Male) starring Richard Johnson as Drummond, made following the success of the James Bond films of the 1960s. Plot A series of inexplicable accidents befall the development of the world's first supersonic airliner, the SST1 ‚Äì a man falls victim to a homicidal air stewardess (an uncredited Maria Aitken) and two women (Yutte Stensgaard and an uncredited Joanna Lumley) perform separate acts of sabotage during tests. The Air Ministry calls on Hugh \\"Bulldog\\" Drummond (Richard Johnson) to investigate. Aided by ditzy American blonde Flicky (Sydne Rome), Drummond uncovers a plot by criminal mastermind Carl Petersen (James Villiers), who stands to gain eight million pounds if the aircraft is not ready by a certain date. Petersen, assisted by beautiful but deadly assassins Helga (Daliah Lavi) and Pandora (Beba Lonƒçar), has developed a number of robots: beautiful girls with electronic brains to help him sabotage the SST1 project by means of infrasound (sound waves with too low frequency to be detected by the human ear) which can be directed at people or objects with devastating results. After the initial sabotage attacks by Peterson's robots, Helga and Pandora begin systematically murdering various people associated with the SSTI, such as engineer Dudley Mortimer (Maurice Denham) and Miss Mary (Robert Morley), a spy who runs a cooking class as a front for his activities. Helga makes contact with Drummond at a shooting party, and attempts to kill him by planting a bomb in his telephone after sleeping with him. Then Helga and Pandora try to kill Drummond again by sabotaging a glider fight, having cut the ripcord from his parachute. Drummond manages to manually open his parachute and escape death. The trail leads Drummond to North Africa, following up on a lead on an infrasound- powered powerboat, where he is assisted by Peregrine Carruthers (Ronnie Stevens) from the British Embassy. Pandora kills the boat owner with a miniature infrasound device, but is thwarted in her attempt to steal the boat. Drummond and Peregrine decide to drive the powerboat in a scheduled race: Helga and Pandora also participate in the race and successfully capture the men and the boat, delivering them all to Petersen at his island headquarters, staffed by an army of his female robots, including the defective but endearing No. 7 (Vanessa Howard). Drummond and Peregrine are also reunited with Flicky, who has successfully infiltrated Petersen's organisation. Over dinner, Petersen reveals the full details of his plan to use infrasound technology to sabotage the SST1's maiden flight. That night, Drummond sleeps with Helga once more, while Pandora contents herself with seducing Peregrine. In the morning, Drummond attempts to retrieve the infrasound powerboat and is met by Flicky, who tells him she is actually a CIA agent assigned to help him. They are caught by Helga ‚Äì Drummond escapes but Helga holds Flicky at gunpoint. Petersen sends his robots to search the island for the runaway agent ‚Äì Drummond is cornered by No. 7, but to his surprise, she deliberately chooses not to reveal his location. Peregrine and Flicky are held hostage in Petersen's control room and are forced to witness the SST1's destruction as he puts his plan into action. Drummond scales the wall of Petersen's hideout, and saves the SST1 from destruction by using Petersen's infrasound waves against him, destroying his control room. Petersen, Pandora and Helga are all apparently killed in the explosion. Drummond, Flicky, Peregrine and No. 7 escape the subsequent mayhem, having retrieved the infrasound device. Flicky reveals herself to be a double agent working for the Russians and escapes on the powerboat with the device. Peregrine, wanting to improve his Russian relations, decides to go with her. As the base finally explodes, Drummond finds comfort in the arms of the beautiful No. 7, who turns out not to be a robot after all.

Musical structure The concerto has three movements: #Andante tranquillo #Presto capriccioso alla napolitana #Vivace About a half-hour in length, it is scored for violin solo and standard orchestra (the revision reduced the size of the percussion section in the original). Like the Viola Concerto (1929), with which, along with Fa√ßade (1921‚Äì22), the composer had made his name, the work follows a pattern of lyrical opening‚Äîscherzo‚Äîsonata- form finale. Among the works written by Walton around the same time are the march Crown Imperial and In Honour of the City of London for double chorus and orchestra (both 1937) and the Second Orchestral Suite from Fa√ßade (1938). The violin concertos of Samuel Barber, Ernest Bloch, Benjamin Britten, Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Paul Hindemith, and Walter Piston are contemporary, as are those of Berg, Schoenberg and Sessions and the second concertos of Bart√≥k, and Prokofiev.

In 2009, its status was upgraded to a Grade II* Historic Park by English Heritage. History Prince's Park Lake The park was originally a private development (though open to the public) by Richard Vaughan Yates, the cost of which was expected to be met through the development of grand Georgian-style housing around the park. Prince's Park was designed by Joseph Paxton and James Pennethorne, opened in 1842 and named for the newborn Edward, Prince of Wales. The plan was drawn by John Robertson and Edward Milner supervised the work. Construction was completed in 1843. The original gates can still be seen. With its serpentine lake and a circular carriage drive, the park set a style which was to be widely emulated in Victorian urban development, most notably by Paxton himself on a larger scale at Birkenhead Park. Prince's Park also influenced its near neighbour, Sefton Park. Richard Yates gave the park to the city in 1849. In the August of the same year, the park was used for a fair, which was well-attended and raised money for local hospitals. The event included various marquees and a hot air balloon flight. A lithograph exists, which documents this event. An obelisk and former drinking fountain in the park bears the inscription: :To the memory of Richard Vaughan Yates :The enlightened & philanthropic founder of :Erected by public subscription 1858 During his time in Liverpool, James Martineau had a house in the park. Around 1863, the housing in the vicinity of the park contained the home of the parents of Edward Gordon Duff. Immediately prior to World War I, the headquarters of the 6th Rifle Battalion were based at Prince's Park Barracks. In 1918 the park was acquired by Liverpool City Council, becoming a fully public park. Within the park is also a gravestone, dated 1926, in memory of a donkey called Judy who gave \\"21 years of service\\", providing rides for children in the park. The Doric Lodge, which was situated by the Sunburst Gates at the main entrance, was destroyed by bombs in 1940. There is a lake in the middle of the park, originally for boating, which is used today for fishing. The foundations of its formerly Grade II listed boathouse, which may have been built by John Robertson and which burnt down in the early 1990s, can still be seen at the south end. Grade II* historic park In 2009 the park had it status upgraded to a Grade II* Historic Park by English Heritage, making it one of three such parks in the city, along with Sefton Park and Anfield Cemetery. English Heritage gave four reasons for upgrading the park's status. These were that it was the first major park created by Paxton, and that it inspired other designers, who incorporated elements of the park in other urban parks throughout the United Kingdom. In addition, the original look of the park is still intact and it is also an important example of a green haven in a city setting.  Sports  Prince's Park currently hosts a free, weekly, timed running event as part of the parkrun organisation. It regularly attracts over 300 runners from the local area who enjoy running the course, taking in the whole park. Prince's Park also offers 4 public tennis courts, which are used year-round NotesReferences=Sources  Further reading * External links *Liverpool City Council Parks and Gardens *Richard Vaughan Yates Obelisk Drinking Fountain *http://www.gardenvisit.com/g/pri3.htm *Aerial Photo 1842 establishments in England Grade II* listed parks and gardens in Merseyside Parks and commons in Liverpool ","title":"Prince's Park, Liverpool"},{"id":"1347777","text":"The BMW 3/15 was BMW's first car, produced in its first version as a \\"Dixi\\" between 1927 and 1929 and then, following BMW's acquisition of the Dixi business in October 1928, in three subsequent versions as BMWs from July 1929 till March 1932, when BMW gave up the licence under which the Austin designed cars were produced.Oswald, p 52 9,307 Dixi 3/15s were manufactured between 1927 and 1929, which was almost as many cars as all the earlier Dixi models together.Oswald, p 82 18,976 BMW 3/15s were manufactured between 1929 and 1932.Norbye, p.249  3/15 DA-1  In 1927, Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which manufactured automobiles under the Dixi marque, entered a contract with the Austin Motor Company to manufacture the Austin Seven under licence. The first fifty Eisenach-built Sevens were right-hand-drive cars assembled in September 1927 from parts provided by Austin's factory in Longbridge. By December 1927, Dixi had begun building their version of the Seven, the left-hand-drive Dixi 3/15 PS DA-1, built from parts made by Dixi. The 3/15 designation was derived from a taxable horsepower rating of 3 PS with an actual power output of approximately The DA-1 designation stood for Erste Deutsche Ausf√ºhrung (First German Version) The main differences between the BMW Dixi 3/15 DA-1 and the contemporary Austin Seven were the addition of Bosch shock absorbers, the placement of the driver's controls on the left side of the vehicle, and the use of metric fasteners. *Top speed: 75 km/h (45 mph) *Acceleration 8 to 40 km/h (5 to 25 mph): 10 seconds *Fuel consumption: appr. BMW bought Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach from parent company Gothaer Waggonfabrik in October 1928. As a result, the Dixi 3/15 PS DA-1, when upgraded for 1929 became the BMW Dixi 3/15 DA-2 or, increasingly, simply as the BMW 3/15 DA-2.Oswald, pp 82-83 & 52-53  3/15 DA-2  The 3/15 DA-2 replaced the DA-1 in April 1929. The main change from the DA-1 was the operation of the foot brakes, controlled via cable linkage, now acting on all four wheels: brakes on the DA-1 had operated only the rear wheels. Other changes included larger tyres and a lower final drive ratio. There was no change in either the size or the claimed output and performance from the car's four cylinder four-stroke side-valve engine.Oswald, p 53 & 83 Available body styles included a steel-bodied two- door saloon, a two-seat convertible, and a delivery van.Norbye, pp.28-29  3/15 DA-3 Wartburg  The 3/15 DA-3 Wartburg was a sports roadster version of the 3/15, and was consequently BMW's first sports car. A drop-centre front axle was used to lower the frame for a lower centre of gravity. The compression ratio of the engine was raised from 5.6:1 to 7.0:1, raising maximum output to at 3500 rpm.BMW 3/15 PS, 315/1 and 319/1 - early roadstersBMW Motorsport - BMW 3/15 Despite sharing the wheelbase and track of the other models, the Wartburg bodied roadster was longer, narrower and at a height of just , lower than the standard bodied DA-2 and DA-4 cars.Oswald, p 53 The Wartburg was introduced in 1930, and the Great Depression had drastically reduced the market for sports cars. It was discontinued in 1931, with 150 sold.  3/15 DA-4  The 3/15 DA-4 replaced the DA-2 in mid-February 1931. While the engine, gearing, and chassis of the DA-4 were unchanged from the original Dixi 3/15 PS DA-1, the DA-4 was a step away from the original Austin design. The DA-4 was the first BMW automobile with independent front suspension, which used the ends of the transverse leaf spring to act as lower control arms, with further wheel location performed by two diagonal leading arms. The DA-4 was heavier than the DA-2, and a larger wheel diameter was used to compensate for this. The Austin-based 3/15 series was discontinued before the March 1932 expiration of BMW's licence to manufacture Austin Sevens.

Most commonly, it refers to the stonework elements that support the glass in a window. The term probably derives from the tracing floors on which the complex patterns of windows were laid out in late Gothic architecture. Tracery could also be found on the interior of buildings and the exterior. There are two main types: plate tracery and the later bar tracery.Honour, H. and J. Fleming, (2009) A World History of Art. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 948. The evolving style from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and changing features, like the thinning of lateral walls and enlarging of windows led to the innovation of tracery. The earliest form of tracery, called plate tracery, began as openings that were pierced from a stone slab. Bar tracery was then implemented, having derived from the plate tracery. However, instead of a slab, the windows were defined by moulded stone mullions, which were lighter and allowed for more openings and intricate designs.Hamlin, Alfred (1906). A text-book of the history of architecture (7 ed ed.). New York, Longmans. pp. 188. Pointed arch windows of Gothic buildings were initially (late 12th‚Äìlate 13th centuries) lancet windows, a solution typical of the Early Gothic or First Pointed style and of the Early English Gothic. Plate tracery was the first type of tracery to be developed, emerging in the style called High Gothic. High Gothic is distinguished by the appearance of bar-tracery, allowing the construction of much larger window openings, and the development of Curvilinear, Flowing, and Reticulated tracery, ultimately contributing to the Flamboyant style. Late Gothic in most of Europe saw tracery patterns resembling lace develop, while in England Perpendicular Gothic or Third Pointed preferred plainer vertical mullions and transoms. Tracery is practical as well as decorative, because the increasingly large windows of Gothic buildings needed maximum support against the wind.  Plate tracery  Plate tracery, Laon Cathedral, north rose windowPlate tracery, in which lights were pierced in a thin wall of ashlar, allowed a window arch to have more than one light - typically two side-by-side and separated by flat stone spandrels. The spandrels were then sculpted into figures like a roundel or a quatrefoil. Plate tracery reached the height of its sophistication with the 12th century windows of Chartres Cathedral and in the \\"Dean's Eye\\" rose window at Lincoln Cathedral. The earliest form of window tracery, typical of Gothic architecture prior to the early 13th century, is known as plate tracery because the individual lights (the glazed openings in the window) have the appearance of being cut out of a flat plate of masonry. Romanesque church windows were normally quite small, somewhat taller than wide and with a simple round-headed ('segmental') arch at the top. From around the 1140s, the pointed arch Gothic window (employed by Abbot Suger for the redesign of the choir at St Denis) started to take over. Plate tracery, Lincoln Cathedral \\"Dean's Eye\\" rose window (c.1225) Rayonnant bar-tracery, Notre-Dame de Paris, north rose window As the buttressing systems of early Gothic architecture reduced the structural need for broad expanses of thick walls, window openings grew progressively larger and instead of having just one very large window per bay division (which would create problems with supporting the glass), the typical early-Gothic 'twin lancet plus oculus' form of plate tracery developed. This consists of two (sometimes three) tall thin lights topped with pointed arches, with a round or trefoil opening placed above them, often contained within a blind arch which gives the whole assemblage a pointed lancet shape (see the example from Soissons Cathedral). With this type of design, the spandrels (i.e. the spaces between the tops of the lancet windows and the oculus) are just blank wall. The practicalities of building window tracery in this way severely limited the complexity of designs that could be produced and although plate tracery designs evolved over the course of the 12th and early 13th centuries, in practice, the only real variation was in the number and size of lancets and in the trefoils, quatrefoils and oculi used to fill the spaces above them. The rose windows of early- and high-Gothic cathedrals, such as the example in the north transept of Laon Cathedral (1170s) or the west facade at Chartres (c. 1210), also employed plate tracery. This greatly limited the overall amount of light admitted to the interior by these windows, as well as restricting the complexity of patterns that could be created. Bar-tracery with cusped circles, Reims Cathedral, apse chapel  Bar tracery  Rayonnant bar-tracery, alt= At the beginning of the 13th century, plate tracery was superseded by bar- tracery. Bar-tracery divides the large lights from one another with moulded mullions. Bar-tracery, an important decorative element of Gothic styles, appeared first at Reims and was employed in England around 1240. After 1220, master builders in England had begun to treat the window openings as a series of openings divided by thin stone bars, while before 1230 the apse chapels of Reims Cathedral were decorated with bar-tracery with cusped circles (with bars radiating from the centre). Bar-tracery became common after c.1240, with increasing complexity and decreasing weight. The lines of the mullions continued beyond the tops of the window lights and subdivided the open spandrels above the lights into a variety of decorative shapes. Rayonnant style (c.1230‚Äìc.1350) was enabled by the development of bar-tracery in Continental Europe and is named for the radiation of lights around a central point in circular rose windows. Rayonnant also deployed mouldings of two different types in tracery, where earlier styles had used moulding of a single size, with different sizes of mullions. The rose windows of Notre-Dame de Paris (c.1270) are typical. The earliest bar tracery designs were made for the aisle windows at Reims Cathedral around 1215. The Reims windows still used the same 'two lancets plus oculus' pattern (as in the Soissons example above), but now the glass panels were held between narrow stone mullions made up of carefully shaped lengths of masonry (fitted together with mortar and metal pins) quite distinct from the wall surrounding them. These mullions were much more slender than the corresponding elements in plate tracery windows and crucially, the previously solid wall areas such as the spandrels could also now be glazed, greatly increasing the amount of light admitted. The cross- section of each mullion or tracery bar was important both for the structural integrity of the window and for the visual effect. As can be seen in Viollet- le-Duc's diagram (right) there was normally a roll-moulding on both the inside and outside of the windows, which made the mullions appear even more slender than they actually were. The shoulder marked 'B' on the diagram is the glazing slot, into which the metal frame (armature) of the window glass is mounted. Unlike with plate tracery, where each stone had to be individually shaped, the elements of bar tracery could be mass-produced to standard templates in the mason's yard ‚Äì work that could continue even when it was too cold for lime mortar to set. The technical aspects of the windows at Reims clearly fascinated Villard de Honnecourt, who visited the construction site, probably in the 1220s, and made a detailed sketch of the various templates, using a key to show how they fitted into the different parts of the window (the templates are in the lower half of folio 32 recto; the symbols besides the templates match similar ones on the detailed drawing of the Reims elevations on the facing page, folio 31 verso). Geometrical bar-tracery, alt= Decorated bar- tracery, All Saints Church, Lindfield, east window  Geometrical tracery  The early phase of Middle Pointed style (late 13th century) is characterized by Geometrical tracery - simple bar-tracery forming patterns of foiled arches and circles interspersed with triangular lights. The mullions of Geometrical style typically had capitals with curved bars emerging from them. Intersecting bar-tracery (c.1300) deployed mullions without capitals which branched off equidistant to the window-head. The window-heads themselves were formed of equal curves forming a pointed arch and the tracery-bars were curved by drawing curves with differing radii from the same centres as the window-heads. The mullions were in consequence branched into Y-shaped designs further ornamented with cusps. The intersecting branches produced an array of lozenge- shaped lights in between numerous lancet arched lights. Y-tracery was often employed in two-light windows c.1300. Geometrical tracery is identified by the circular openings at the head of the arch of the window. A common composition is three lights beneath two circles and a third at the point of the arch, such an example can be seen along the aisle at the Lincoln Cathedral in England. Also at the Lincoln Cathedral, the east window is an expanded version of this idea with two interior arches, a total of eight lower lights, four small circular lights topped with two larger circles to fill out the interior arches, and finally above all one large circular shape filled with seven smaller circular lights. Geometrical tracery, in its early stages, had a rule of equilateral law, where the tracery design follows the shape of the arch in an equilateral manner. Additional decorative elements can be implemented, such as foliation or the \\"spherical triangle\\". The use of spherical triangles is a later adaption and likely reflects religious significance.  Curvilinear (flowing) tracery  Curvilinear bar-tracery, alt= Second Pointed (14th century) saw Intersecting tracery elaborated with ogees, creating a complex reticular (net-like) design known as Reticulated tracery. Second Pointed architecture deployed tracery in highly decorated fashion known as Curvilinear and Flowing (Undulating). These types of bar-tracery were developed further throughout Europe in the 15th century into the Flamboyant style, named for the characteristic flame-shaped spaces between the tracery-bars. These shapes are known as daggers, fish-bladders, or mouchettes. Starting in the late thirteenth century and at the beginning of the fourteenth century tracery took on more fluid characteristics. A common shape that was used in curvilinear tracery was that of the ogee, which was too weak for structural application and was instead used as a decorative element. The use of the ogee in curvilinear tracery can be seen in the west window of St Mary's parish church in Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire. A secondary style, considered related to curvilinear tracery, is called reticulated tracery. Reticulated tracery fills the head of the arch with repeated forms creating the appearance of a net-like pattern. Perpendicular bar-tracery, King's College Chapel, Cambridge, great east window  Perpendicular  Third Pointed or Perpendicular Gothic developed in England from the later 14th century and is typified by Rectilinear tracery (panel-tracery). The mullions are often joined together by transoms and continue up their straight vertical lines to the top of the window's main arch, some branching off into lesser arches, and creating a series of panel-like lights. Perpendicular strove for verticality and dispensed with the Curvilinear style's sinuous lines in favour of unbroken straight mullions from top to bottom, transected by horizontal transoms and bars. Four-centred arches were used in the 15th and 16th centuries to create windows of increasing size with flatter window-heads, often filling the entire wall of the bay between each buttress. The windows were themselves divided into panels of lights topped by pointed arches struck from four centres. The transoms were often topped by miniature crenallations. The windows at King‚Äôs College Chapel, Cambridge (1446‚Äì1515) represent the heights of Perpendicular tracery.  Blind and open tracery  As bar tracery opened the way for more complex patterns, masons started applying those same patterns to other surfaces as well as the actual window openings. When used on an otherwise solid walls, such motifs are known as blind tracery, a decorative effect first applied on the west facade of the church of St Nicaise at Reims (1230's). Conversely, tracery was also constructed as openwork screens, which could either match the window tracery behind them (e.g. the Basilica of Saint Urbain, Troyes) or create a visual counterpoint to it, as on the exterior of the west facade of Strasbourg Cathedral. Open tracery in particular was a key feature of the later phases of Rayonnant and Flamboyant Gothic. Arches, windows and traceryEarly or Lancet Gothic= The simplest shape of a Gothic window is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet windows may be used singly, as in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, or grouped, as in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral where they are in two in the aisles and threes in the clerestory. Because large lancet windows, such as those lighting the aisles of a church may be wide in comparison to a single light in a traceried window, they often have armatures of wood or iron to support the glass. The arch of a lancet opening is often equilateral, but sometimes is much more acute, and when employed in the arcade of a choir apse, such as at Westminster Abbey, adds to the emphasis of height. The simple shape of the lancet arch may appear in Early Gothic buildings on openings of all types, doorways, niches, arcades, including galleries; and belfry openings. The use of lancet windows is found in the Early Gothic architecture of France, at Saint-Denis, and Sens and Senlis cathedrals. At Chartres and Laon cathedrals lancet windows are grouped beneath the rose windows. Tall narrow lancets are also found in radiating groups in the chancel apses of some churches, such as Chartres Cathedral. It is common in France for lancet windows to be used in smaller, narrower spaces, such as the chapels of a chevet, while traceries windows are used in the clerestory. The style Lancet Gothic is known in England as Early English Gothic, with Salisbury Cathedral being the prime example. York Minster has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. Wells Cathedral is notable for the continuous rows of lancet openings that make up the triforiun galleries. Lancet windows are used extensively in the Gothic churches of Italy, including Florence Cathedral and in the Brick Gothic churches of Germany and Poland. =Geometric Gothic (England)= Unusual fretwork tracery, Barsham, Suffolk parish church, east end The Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. In France, windows of clerestorys, and other larger windows were commonly divided into two lights, with some simple Geometric tracery above, a circle or a cinquefoil or sexfoil. This style of window remained popular without great change until after 1300. In England there was a much greater variation in the design of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces. The style is known as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English cathedrals and major churches, where both the eastern and the western terminations of the building may be occupied by a single large window such as the east window at Lincoln and the west window at Worcester Cathedral. Windows of complex design and of three or more lights or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches springing from the vertical mullions. =Rayonnant Gothic= Rayonnant is the term used particularly to described the style that produced the great rose windows of France. These windows deck not only the west fronts of churches, but often, as at Notre-Dame de Paris, the transept gables as well. It is common that although the transepts of French churches do not project strongly, they are given visual importance almost equal to the west front, including large decorated portals and a rose window. Particularly fine examples are at Notre-Dame and Chartres Cathedral. =Flamboyant Gothic= The Flamboyant Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point. These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch. It is not employed at all for vaulting. Some of the most beautiful and famous traceried windows of Europe employ this type of tracery. It can be seen at St Stephen's Vienna, Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, at the Cathedrals of Limoges and Rouen in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of York Minster with its design based on the Sacred Heart, the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at Carlisle Cathedral and the exquisite East window of Selby Abbey. Doorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France. They are much rarer in England. A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at Rochester Cathedral. The style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at Ely, the Screen at Lincoln and externally on the fa√ßade of Exeter Cathedral. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in Vienna Cathedral. Perpendicular Gothic: King's College Chapel, Cambridge (1446‚Äì1544) =Perpendicular Gothic (England)= The depressed or four-centred arch is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small radius and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point. This type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface. The style, known as Perpendicular, that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France. It can be seen notably at the East End of Gloucester Cathedral where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court. There are three very famous royal chapels and one chapel-like Abbey which show the style at its most elaborate: King's College Chapel, Cambridge; St George's Chapel, Windsor; Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster Abbey and Bath Abbey. However very many simpler buildings, especially churches built during the wool boom in East Anglia, are fine examples of the style. Tracery patterns Most 19th-century histories of Gothic architectural style used a series of typological categories based on the evolution of the dominant patterns of window tracery. In terms of the overall development of Gothic architecture, the crucial development was not so much the use of any particular tracery patterns but the transition from plate- to bar-tracery, which was what made the Rayonnant and subsequent styles possible. To construct traceries proportionately it is important to use the basis of geometry to help create correct angles for the design.  Rounded quatrefoils  In Gothic tracery, rounded quatrefoils have been used quite a bit in modern industrial ornament which is used to embellish different parts of a building or certain objects. This is formed with the use of squares as the base and then constructing circles tangent to each side of the square in the center of the side as well as a tangent to each of the circle's sides. This type of construction is used generously in Gothic buildings. For instance, rounded quatrefoils were used in tiled pavements like the ones in the Gloucester Cathedral or in Great Malvern, Worcestershire, England. It was also common in the work of the Chinese and Japanese.  Rounded multifoils  Rounded multifoils are found in different parts of gothic buildings such as circular windows and pointed windows that have circular lights in it. These designs can have rings ranging from seven to eleven small circles. They are often seen in England but have become quite popular in France for French Gothic architecture. This design has been used since about around medieval time in tiles that Gothic building use. The tile pavement used in Yorkshire, England for Jervaulx Abbey had rings of tangents circles of six and twelve inside of another given circle.alt= Strasbourg Cathedral, west front rose window, schematic  Tracing floors and √©pures  As the complexity of tracery increased, so did the need for masons to draw out their designs in advance, either as a way of experimenting with patterns or as a way of communicating their designs to other craftsmen or to their patrons. Because of the cost and size limitations of parchment sheets, such designs would normally be drawn by incising onto a whitewashed board or a conveniently placed section of flat wall. In the latter case, the wall would be prepared with a thin layer of plaster, which would show the design more clearly. A number of churches and cathedrals still show the faint remains of these tracings (or √©pures as they are known in France), from where the mason's compass points scratched through the plaster and into the masonry below. (Examples include some experimental 14th century window tracery patterns at the eastern end of the south wall inside the Galillee porch of Ely Cathedral, or the extensive series of tracings on the flat aisle roofs of Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral.) A number of major building sites (including Westminster Abbey, Wells Cathedral and York Minster) originally had dedicated tracery chambers, where the architects could prepare their designs in relative comfort. The availability of a large flat floor surface meant that designs could be drawn life-size and the individual elements of bar tracery laid out on the plan to test their goodness of fit, before hoisting them up the scaffolding for installation in the actual window openings. This also meant that masons could carry on working through the winter season, when building work would normally grind to a halt. The tracing floors themselves were covered with plaster-of-Paris, which could be relaid and smoothed down after each set of designs were finished with. The 14th- century tracing house at York (also known as the Mason's Loft) survives to this day on the upper storey of the corridor leading to the Chapter House, the complex web of lines and curves scratched into the floor serving as witnesses to the countless different designs that were worked out in there. The high- quality carpentry and the inclusion of a garderobe and fireplace in the York tracing house also give an indication of the rising status of the architect around the 14th century.

It takes its name from the village near the town Przeworsk where the first artifacts were found. Society The Przeworsk culture people lived in small, unprotected villages, populated each by a few dozen residents at most, made up of several houses, usually set partially below the ground level (semi- sunken), each covering an area of 8‚Äì22 square meters. They knew how to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in Stanis≈Çawice, Bochnia County.Archaeological Motorway by Ryszard Naglik, Archeologia ≈ªywa (Living Archeology), special English issue 2005Archeological Museum in Krak√≥w web site Fields were being used for crop cultivation for a while and then as pastures, when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share plows were introduced the fields were alternated between tillage and grazing. Several or more settlements made up a micro-region, within which the residents cooperated economically and buried their dead in a common cemetery, but which was separated from other micro-regions by undeveloped areas. A number of such micro-regions possibly made up a tribe, with these separated by empty space, zones \\"of mutual fear\\", as Tacitus put it.

Influences Approximate locations of Przeworsk culture (green) and Zarubintsy culture (red) Scholars view the Przeworsk culture as an amalgam of a series of localized cultures. Continuity with the preceding Pomeranian culture is observed, albeit modified by significant influences from the La Tene and Jastorf cultures. The Przeworsk culture is often associated with the Vandals, however the culture has also been linked to the early Slavs,J. P. Mallory: Przeworsk culture. W: J. P. Mallory, D. Adams: Encyclopedia Of Indo- European Culture. Routledge, 1997, s. 470. . and most likely was of mixed Slavic and Germanic nature.Pronk-Tiethoff, Saskia. New York 2013.

To the east, the Przeworsk culture is connected with the Zarubintsy culture in what is now northern Ukraine and southern Belarus. Later in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, much of this area was subsequently absorbed by the Wielbark culture and Chernyakhov culture. Features The main characteristic feature of the Przeworsk culture are burials. These were mostly cremations, with occasional inhumation. Warrior burials are notable, which often include horse- gear and spurs.

The philosophy can be summarized as \\"more is more\\", contrasting with the minimalist motto \\"less is more\\". Literature The term maximalism is sometimes associated with post-modern novels, such as those by David Foster Wallace and Thomas Pynchon,Minimalism vs. MaximalismThe American Writers Museum where digression, reference, and elaboration of detail occupy a great fraction of the text. It can refer to anything seen as excessive, overtly complex and \\"showy\\", providing redundant overkill in features and attachments, grossness in quantity and quality, or the tendency to add and accumulate to excess. Novelist John Barth defines literary maximalism through the medieval Roman Catholic Church's opposition between \\"two...roads to grace:\\" :the via negativa of the monk πs cell and the hermit πs cave, and the via affirmativa of immersion in human affairs, of being in the world whether or not one is of it. Critics have aptly borrowed those terms to characterize the difference between Mr. Beckett, for example, and his erstwhile master James Joyce, himself a maximalist except in his early works.Barth, John. ‚ÄúA Few Words About Minimalism‚Äù, New York Times Book Review, p.1. Dec. 28, 1986. Takayoshi Ishiwari elaborates on Barth's definition by including a postmodern approach to the notion of authenticity. Thus: :Under this label come such writers as, among others, Thomas Pynchon and Barth himself, whose bulky books are in marked contrast with Barthelme πs relatively thin novels and collections of short stories. These maximalists are called by such an epithet because they, situated in the age of epistemological uncertainty and therefore knowing that they can never know what is authentic and inauthentic, attempt to include in their fiction everything belonging to that age, to take these authentic and inauthentic things as they are with all their uncertainty and inauthenticity included; their work intends to contain the maximum of the age, in other words, to be the age itself, and because of this their novels are often encyclopedic.

The force used to open the door is stored in some type of spring and when released this energy is then utilised to return the door to a closed position. Door closers can be linked to a building‚Äôs fire alarm system. Where doors need to be held open for the majority of the time they are held back with an electromagnetic device. When the fire alarm is triggered it cuts power to the electromagnetic hold-open device allowing the doors to close. These hold-open devices can be separate from the door closer or part of its design. Early history alt=This is a William Newman single action \\"Invincible\\" model. Gravity alone may be considered to be the first \\"door closer.\\" Before any mechanical devices were attached to doors to close them, the way in which the door was hung automatically closed the door once opened. This technique to hang doors may have originated with gates because of the need for them to remain closed once traffic has passed through. The method involves an intentional misalignment of the hooks or pintles that traditional strap hinges rest on, the bottom pintle protruding from the door post further than the top one. This configuration ensures the weight of the door and gravity will always close any gate or door opened. It is best used on doors only opening one way, many old church doors for instance can still be seen to be hung in this manner. One of the first references concerning a device to close a door can be found in the writings of Hero of Alexandria who describes his \\"automata\\" which controlled the doors of temples, both opening and closing them automatically. Weights and levers have also been used to close doors, Another device for smaller domestic doors used a loop of rope or skein fixed to the door frame, that was twisted, with a piece of wood placed in between the twists to push the door. The opening of the door twists the skein further, when the door is released the rope's torsional force pushes the arm back against the door, thereby closing it. In more modern times the clock manufacturers Thwaites and Reed in 1850 claimed to be the original inventors of the spiral door spring. The earliest English patent for a door closing device consisting of weights and pulleys was issued in 1786 to Francis Moore The first English patent issued that mentions a spring can be traced to a few years later to that of Henry Downer. (Ironmonger) of Fleet Street, London recognised for the invention of a \\"spring to shut a door\\" (1790), There were even earlier devices invented to close a door, for instance, Mr Delevitz's model of a door with spiral spring hinges (1768) Earlier still is reference by way of a letter between Sir Edward Filmer (3rd Bart.) and his brother, Beversham Filmer dated 1748, in which they discuss a door spring. Whilst not a door closer, there was a mechanical statue, reported in the Stamford Gazette and displayed by a Monsieur Delanois at the White Swan in Stamford, December 21, 1736 that opened and closed his own door. Closer development The first door closers consisted of just a spring mechanism only, as time went on the rate at which the door closed was arrested or checked by adding an additional checking device. Door closers at this time were known as a door spring and check. Later these two devices were combined into one unit that both closed the door and slowed the speed at which this was done. These early \\"door closers\\" used a pneumatic piston to check the speed, later models used a hydraulic or oil filled device for the same effect. The first patent for a pneumatic device to prevent the sudden slamming of a door was given to William Bullock and James Boaz, on May 13, 1813 (Patent Number 3695). An improved hydraulic device to prevent the \\"clapping\\" (slamming) of doors was patented by William Overden Snr and William Overden Jnr in 1864. Door closers that utilize the properties of vulcanised Indian rubber have also been patented and used. The use of door closers expanded during the Victorian era. Companies such as William Tonks and Son, James Cartland and Sons and William Newman and Son and were all based in and around Birmingham. receiving in 1974 an award for their one millionth door closer produced. In 1907 the Briton B was first placed on the market. In the United States, Lewis. C. Norton started his business in 1877, entering the door closer market in 1880 with a door check for the Boston Trinity Church. Eugene Blount, Francis Richards and Joseph Bardsley also played important parts in the development, improvement and commercialization of door closers along with other companies, including Yale, Norton, Rixson and The Shelby Spring Hinge Company. Since the 1970s/1980s Dorma and GEZE have pushed to dominate the door closer business, with Ingersol Rand, ASSA ABLOY, RIXSON having large portions of the American market. Types A concealed jamb-mounted door closer There are eight styles of interior door-closer: * Surface-mounted * Concealed in frame (jamb) * Concealed in header (transom) *Concealed in floor * Concealed in door *Concealed in shoe *Integral to hinge ** Spring Hinge ** Self-Closing Hinge Overhead or surface-mounted door closers come in four variations: slide- track arm, regular arm surface mounted, parallel arm surface mounted, and top jamb mounted, most are surface mounted although some manufacturers offer concealed models too. Another type of surface mounted door closer is attached to the door frame behind the door (where the hinges are) next to the middle hinge. The \\"arm\\" (tail) rests against the door, and a spring that is twisted by the user opening the door closes the door by returning to its pre-twisted shape. This type of door closer is referred to as a \\"tail\\" spring and is one of the more simple mechanisms, having no damping control. There is also the storm door and screen door variation of the door closer: As the name implies, these piston type closers are used on storm doors, security, and screen doors which give the home an extra line of defense against weather, intruders, and insects. Whereas interior closers typically use hydraulics, storm door closers are more typically pneumatic, using air and springs to close the door. Storm door closers often have a small metal square washer on the rod that is used to lock the closer in the open position if required, more recent models have a button to actuate the hold open feature to make this process easier. Concealed, jamb-mounted type door closers, mounted in morticed recesses in the door and door frame, are concealed when the door is closed. These are available in controlled and uncontrolled versions, selected according to the application for which they are intended. Such concealed closers when mounted inside a pocket in the door frame (door jamb) are commonly known as \\"perco's\\" or perkomatic closers When door closers are mounted in the header they are known as transom closers. These can be HO (hold open) or NHO (none hold open). Door closers that are mounted in the floor directly under the pivot point beneath a decor plate are referred to as floor springs and come in two variations, single action for doors opening one way (right and left hand) and double action for doors that open inward and outward, both types can either be none hold open (NHO) or hold open (HO). They consist of a pivot which protrudes from the top of the device and mates to a shoe (or strap) that the door is connected to, some kind of spring and a damping device to control the rate at which the door closes (very early ones had no damping), these damping devices are either pneumatic (known as an air spring or air check) or hydraulic in nature. When a floor spring is used to control a door, they can be used in conjunction with hinges but generally have a single pivot point at the top of the door, this pivot point is known as a top centre.Building construction and drawings, Charles Frederick Mitchell, George Arthur Mitchell, B.T. Batsford, 1906 Page 355 Floor springs are usually the most expensive and most hard wearing of all the door closing devices in use. The shoe door closer, known as a heel spring, is housed entirely in the 'heel' of the door, inside a shoe. This shoe looks very much like the shoe used in conjunction with floor springs. Finally, there is the spring and the self-closing hinge. This type of door closer uses a spring mounted in a hinge and is integral to its design. The spring can be either visible or hidden within a tube and can be found more commonly on interior doors. When used on doors that open both ways they are known as double action spring hinges. Self-closing hinges look like spring hinges but operate like door closers, it solves clearance problem and provides speed control function in one component. Manual Old type of manual door closer (made by BKS) A manual door closer stores the energy used in the opening of the door in a spring, either a compression, torsion, tension, volute or leaf. and releases it to close the door. Some closers allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open along with providing more closing force. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most modern door closers use oil- filled hydraulic dampers, although spring mechanisms and friction alone may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for exterior doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, potentially damage to the door, nearby objects, or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the sweep speed and the latch speed of the door and some closers are optioned with a delayed action valve. The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last 10 to 15 degrees of it closing cycle and is often set faster than the \\"sweep\\" so that the door can properly latch closed. The sweep speed is the speed which the door travels along the majority of its travel, before reaching the final 10 to 15 degrees, and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, a delayed action closer may be appropriate. The delayed action valve slows the sweep speed dramatically for roughly the first half of the sweep range. Door closers which provide this two or three- stage action and close doors at a determined rate are called 'controlled' door closers. Automatic An automatic door closer, more often called a \\"door opener\\", opens the door itself, typically under the control of a push button, motion detector or other device, and then closes it as well, employing a motion or proximity detector to determine when it is safe to close the door. These types of door mechanisms can also be used for security purposes, keeping the door locked on a electromagnetic device (mag-lock) until either a code is entered into a key pad or a swipe card is presented. High security areas may opt for a biometric system, using a retinal scanner or some sort of electronic finger print device in place of the key pad or card method. Control of closing force and speed Closers often feature dampers that offer control over the closing force and speed. Such dampers are usually hydraulic or pneumatic dashpots. Usage=Fire safety Door closers are most commonly installed on fire doors and entrance doors, which need to be closed in case of fire, to help prevent the spread of fire and smoke. In most countries, their performance will be governed by national standards. Maintaining room temperatures Door closers also play a role in maintaining desired interior temperatures, reducing air movement in and out of conditioned space.  Security  Door closers also play a role in security at building entrance doors, closing doors once somebody has passed through and re-latching the door lock.  Noise control  In buildings that require noise control (Studios) door closers play an important part in the suppression of unwanted noise both in and out rooms and the buildings themselves.  Privacy  Door closers are often used to ensure privacy in toilets and washrooms.  Hygiene  Door closers can also play a part in keeping buildings and rooms free from dirt, debris and pests.

The AMD Am29000, commonly shortened to 29k, is a family of 32-bit RISC microprocessors and microcontrollers developed and fabricated by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Based on the seminal Berkeley RISC, the 29k added a number of significant improvements. They were, for a time, the most popular RISC chips on the market, widely used in laser printers from a variety of manufacturers. Several versions were introduced during the period from 1988 to 1995, beginning with the 29000. The final model, the 29050, was the first superscalar version, retiring up to four instructions per cycle, and also including a greatly improved floating point unit (FPU). In late 1995 AMD dropped development of the 29k because the design team was transferred to support the PC side of the business. What remained of AMD's embedded business was realigned towards the embedded 186 family of 80186 derivatives. The majority of AMD's resources were then concentrated on their high-performance, desktop x86 clones, using many of the ideas and individual parts of the latest 29k to produce the AMD K5. Design The 29000 evolved from the same Berkeley RISC design that also led to the Sun SPARC and Intel i960. One design element used in all of the Berkeley-derived designs is the concept of register windows, a technique used to speed up procedure calls significantly. The idea is to use a large set of registers as a stack, loading local data into a set of registers during a call, and marking them \\"dead\\" when the procedure returns. Values being returned from the routines would be placed in the \\"global page\\", the top eight registers in the SPARC (for instance). The competing early RISC design from Stanford University, the Stanford MIPS, also looked at this concept but decided that improved compilers could make more efficient use of general purpose registers than a hard-wired window. In the original Berkeley design, SPARC, and i960, the windows were fixed in size. A routine using only one local variable would still use up eight registers on the SPARC, wasting this expensive resource. It was here that the 29000 differed from these earlier designs, using a variable window size. In this example only two registers would be used, one for the local variable, another for the return address. It also added more registers, including the same 128 registers for the procedure stack, but adding another 64 for global access. In comparison, the SPARC had 128 registers in total, and the global set was a standard window of eight. This change resulted in much better register use in the 29000 under a wide variety of workloads. The 29000 also extended the register window stack with an in-memory (and in theory, in-cache) stack. When the window filled the calls would be pushed off the end of the register stack into memory, restored as required when the routine returned. Generally, the 29000's register usage was considerably more advanced than competing designs based on the Berkeley concepts. AMD 29040 Another difference with the Berkeley design is that the 29000 included no special-purpose condition code register. Any register could be used for this purpose, allowing the conditions to be easily saved at the expense of complicating some code. An instruction prefetch buffer was used that stored up to 16 instructions, used to improve performance during branches--the 29000 did not include any branch prediction system so there was a delay if a branch was taken (nor was it originally superscalar, so it could not \\"do both sides\\" as is common in some designs). The buffer mitigated this by storing four instructions from the other side of the branch, which could be run instantly while the buffer was re-filled with new instructions from memory. Versions The first 29000 was released in 1988, including a built-in MMU but floating point support was offloaded to the 29027 FPU. Units with failed MMU's or BTC's were sold as the 29005. The line was upgraded with the 29030 and 29035, which included an 8 KB or 4 KB of instruction cache, respectively. Another update integrated the FPU on-die and added a 4 KB data cache to produce the 29040. The last general-purpose version was the 29050. This was a significant upgrade to the original design, the first superscalar version which could execute instructions out-of-order and speculatively. Up to six instructions could be worked on at the same time through various pipeline stages, and four could be retired at any cycle. The 29050 also included a significantly improved FPU. The 29050 was initially available with clock rates of 25, 50, and 75 MHz. A 100 MHz version was introduced later. Several portions of the 29050 design were used as the basis for the K5 series of x86-compatible processors. The FPU adder and multiplier were carried over with some layout changes, a nanocode engine was added to the FPU to accommodate the complex instructions found in x86 but not on the 29050, while the rest of the core design was used along with complex microcode to translate x86 instructions to 29k-like 'uops' on the fly. The Honeywell 29KII is a cpu based on the AMD 29050, and it was extensively used in real-time avionics.

During World War II, Galen led Catholic protest against Nazi euthanasia and denounced Gestapo lawlessness and the persecution of the church. He was appointed a Cardinal by Pope Pius XII in 1946. He was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. Born into the German aristocracy, Galen received part of his education in Austria from the Jesuits at the Stella Matutina School in the town of Feldkirch. After his ordination he worked in Berlin at Saint Matthias. He intensely disliked the liberal values of the Weimar Republic and opposed individualism, socialism, and democracy. A staunch German nationalist and patriot, he considered the Treaty of Versailles unjust and viewed Bolshevism as a threat to Germany and the Church. He espoused the stab- in-the-back theory: that the German military was defeated in 1918 only because it had been undermined by defeatist elements on the home front. He expressed his opposition to modernity in his book Die Pest des Laizismus und ihre Erscheinungsformen (The Plague of Laicism and its Forms of Expression) (1932). After serving in Berlin parishes from 1906 to 1929, he became the pastor of M√ºnster's St. Lamberti Church, where he was noted for his political conservatism before being appointed Bishop of M√ºnster in 1933. Galen began to criticize Hitler's movement in 1934. He condemned the Nazi worship of race in a pastoral letter on 29 January 1934. He assumed responsibility for the publication of a collection of essays that criticized the Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg and defended the teachings of the Catholic Church. He was an outspoken critic of certain Nazi policies and helped draft Pope Pius XI's 1937 anti-Nazi encyclical Mit brennender Sorge (With Burning Concern). In 1941, he delivered three sermons in which he denounced the arrest of Jesuits, the confiscation of church property, attacks on the Church, and in the third, the state-approved killing of invalids.\\"The Murder of Unproductive Persons\\" Clemens von Galen The sermons were illegally circulated in print, inspiring some German Resistance groups, including the White Rose. Despite Galen's opposition to National Socialism, he nonetheless believed Germany was the last bulwark against the spread of godless Bolshevism. Parts of a sermon he gave in 1943 were used by the Nazis to aid in the enlistment of Dutch men to voluntarily join the SS.Griech-Polelle, p. 22, 125. Galen feared that German Catholics were being relegated to second-class status in Hitler's Germany and believed Hitler was missing the point that the Catholic Church and the state could be aligned against Bolshevism. Galen's selective opposition to elements of National Socialism never amounted to solidarity with excluded groups such as the Jews, and while he spoke out against the euthanasia project he was silent on other issues such as the roundup, deportation and mass murder of Jews.Bishop von Galen: German Catholicism and National Socialism, Beth A. Griech-Polelle, p.22 Early years Galen was one of thirteen children born to an old aristocratic family in Burg Dinklage. Galen belonged to one of the oldest and most distinguished noble families of Westphalia. Until 1890, Clemens August and his brother Franz were tutored at home. At a time when the Jesuits were still not permitted in M√ºnster, he received his main schooling at a Jesuit School, Stella Matutina in the Vorarlberg, Austria, where only Latin was spoken. He was not an easy student to teach, and his Jesuit superior wrote to his parents: \\"Infallibility is the main problem with Clemens, who under no circumstance will admit that he may be wrong. It is always his teachers and educators who are wrong.Maria Anna Zumholz, Die Tradition meines Hauses. Zur Pr√§gung Clemens August Graf von Galens in Elternhaus, Schule und Universit√§t, in: Joachim Kuropka (Hrsg.): Neue Forschungen zum Leben und Wirken des Bischofs von M√ºnster, Regensberg, M√ºnster 1992, S. 18. Clemens August (third from left) at age six Because Prussia did not recognize the Stella Matutina academy, Clemens returned home in 1894 to attend a public school in Vechta and by 1896 both Clemens and Franz had passed the examinations that qualified them to attend a university. Upon graduation, his fellow students wrote in his yearbook: \\"Clemens doesn't make love or go drinking, he does not like worldly deceit.\\" In 1896 he went to study at the Catholic University of Freiburg, which had been established in 1886 by the Dominicans, where he encountered the writings of Thomas Aquinas. In 1897 he began to study a variety of topics, including literature, history, and philosophy. One of his teachers was history professor and noted biblical archaeologist Johann Peter Kirsch. Following their first winter semester at Freiburg, Clemens and Franz visited Rome for three months. At the end of the visit he told Franz that he had decided to become a priest though he was unsure whether to become a contemplative Benedictine or a Jesuit.Griech-Polelle, p. 14. In 1899 he met Pope Leo XIII in a private audience. He studied at the Theological Faculty and Convent in Innsbruck, founded in 1669 by the Jesuits, where scholastic philosophy was emphasized, and new concepts and ideas avoided. Galen left Innsbruck in 1903 to enter the seminary in M√ºnster and was ordained a priest on 28 May 1904 by Bishop Hermann Dingelstadt. At first he worked for a family member, the Auxiliary Bishop of M√ºnster, as Chaplain.Gottfried Hasenkamp: Der Kardinal ‚Äì Taten und Tage des Bischofs von M√ºnster Clemens August Graf von Galen. Aschendorff, M√ºnster, 2. Aufl. 1985, , S. 9 f. Soon he moved to Berlin, where he worked as parish priest at St. Matthias.In Joachim Kuropka (Hrsg.): Neue Forschungen zum Leben und Wirken des Bischofs von M√ºnster. Regensberg, M√ºnster 1992, S. 32 f. Berlin (1906‚Äì1929) Galen arrived in Berlin on 23 April 1906 and stayed until 16 April 1929. Germany's capital contained districts of Protestant elites, a Catholic community composed of primarily working-class people and a Jewish community of both middle-class and poorer immigrants. It was a booming commercial and cultural metropolis at the time he arrived ‚Äî its population increased from 900,000 in 1871 to slightly less than 4 million by 1920. Religion did not bring the community together ‚Äî \\"religion and fears of a loss of religious belief came to be a major source of internal division.\\"Smith, German Nationalism and Religious Conflict, cited by Griech- Polelle, p. 16. Smith argues that anti-Semitism coexisted with confessional antagonisms between Catholics and Protestants. For the working class, Catholicism and Social Democracy competed for allegiance. In this atmosphere, Galen sought to be an energetic and idealistic leader of his parish. He made visits to the sick and poor, became president of the Catholic Young Men's Association, gave religious instruction in the schools, and for his efforts he was named Papa Galen by the parishioners he served. A commanding presence ( tall) ‚Äî his rooms were furnished simply, he wore unpretentious clothing, and he spoke plainly ‚Äî he did not like the theatre, secular music (except for military marches), or literature. His only reported vice, which he refused to give up, was smoking his pipes.Griech-Polelle, p. 17 Clemens August von Galen in 1899 after a hunt During the First World War, Galen volunteered for military service in order to demonstrate his loyalty to the Kaiser. As parish priest, he encouraged his parishioners to serve their country willingly. In August 1917 he visited the front lines in France and found the optimistic morale of the troops uplifting. \\"Feelings of German nationalism, apparently, could triumph over concern for the violations of the sanctity of human life in war.\\"Griech-Polelle, p. 18. In 1916 and 1917 he welcomed reports that the German military had a plan to colonize Eastern Europe, stating that German Catholics should be moved into the area, especially Lithuania, with the goal not of expelling the Lithuanians, but educating them to think and feel as Germans. Following the German surrender in November 1918, Galen, still in Berlin, worked to create soup kitchens, aid societies, and clothing drives to deal with immediate problems of hunger and poverty. He feared the lower classes would embrace radicalism and anarchy. Galen deplored the fall of the monarchy and was suspicious of the new Weimar democracy, believing that \\"the revolutionary ideas of 1918 had caused considerable damage to Catholic Christianity.\\"Portmann, p. 66. He believed the stab-in-the-back myth, which held that the German Army hadn't been defeated in battle but by being undermined by defeatist elements on the home front and, as did most Germans, considered the Treaty of Versailles unjust. Throughout the Weimar years he remained on the right of German politics. He often criticized the Centre Party for being too left-wing.Griech-Polelle, p. 20. Galen openly supported the Protestant Paul von Hindenburg against the Centre Party's candidate, Wilhelm Marx, in the presidential elections of 1925. Galen was known as a fierce anti- Communist (he later supported the battle on the Eastern Front against Joseph Stalin's regime in the Soviet Union). His views on Communism were largely formed as a consequence of the Stalinization and relentless persecution of Christians within the Soviet Union after 1918, during which virtually all Catholic bishops were either killed or forced underground. He also expressed his opposition to modernity in his book Die Pest des Laizismus und ihre Erscheinungsformen (The Plague of Laicism and its Forms of Expression) (1932). M√ºnster Galen became the pastor of St. Lambert's Church, M√ºnster, where he initially upset some parishioners with his political conservatism. At a meeting in M√ºnster of the Association of Catholic Academicians in June 1933, Galen spoke against those scholars who had criticised the Nazi government and called for \\"a just and objective evaluation of [Hitler's] new political movement\\". In 1933, Galen was elected bishop of M√ºnster, although he was not the popular candidate to succeed the previous bishop, Johannes Poggenburg, and was selected only after other candidates had declined to be nominated and despite a protest from the Papal Nuncio Cesare Orsenigo, who reported that Galen was bossy and paternalistic in his public utterances.Ludger Grevelh√∂rster: Kardinal Clemens August Graf von Galen in seiner Zeit. Aschendorff, M√ºnster 2005, , S. 57 Galen was named bishop by Pope Pius XI on 5 September 1933. On 28 October, he was consecrated as bishop in M√ºnster's cathedral by Cardinal Karl Joseph Schulte. He chose as his motto \\"Nec laudibus nec timore\\", a phase from the liturgy used for a bishop's consecration when the consecrating bishop prays that the new bishop be overcome \\"neither by flattery nor by fear\\". As bishop, Galen campaigned against the totalitarian approach of the Nazi Party in national education, appealing to parents to insist on Catholic teaching in schools. Citing the recently agreed-upon Reichskonkordat assurance that the Church had the right to determine its own religious instruction, he successfully forced the National Socialists to permit continued Catholic instruction in Catholic schools. It was one of the first instances where the Reichskonkordat was used by the Church against the government, which was one of the intentions of Pope Pius XI.L√∂ffler (Hrsg.): Bischof Clemens August Graf von Galen ‚Äì Akten, Briefe und Predigten 1933‚Äì1946. Ferdinand Sch√∂ningh, Paderborn/Munich/Vienna/Zurich, 2nd edition 1996, p. 46 f. ; and Rudolf Willenborg: \\"Katholische Eltern, das m√º√üt ihr wissen!\\" ‚Äì Der Kampf des Bischofs Clemens August Graf von Galen gegen den totalen Erziehungsanspruch des Nationalsozialismus.

In Joachim Kuropka (Hrsg.): Neue Forschungen zum Leben und Wirken des Bischofs von M√ºnster. Regensberg, M√ºnster 1992, p. 101, 102 f. In 1933, when the Nazi school superintendent of M√ºnster issued a decree that religious instruction be combined with discussion of the \\"demoralising power\\" of the \\"people of Israel\\", Galen refused, writing that such interference in the school curriculum was a breach of the Concordat and that he feared children would be confused as to their \\"obligation to act with charity to all men\\" and as to the historical mission of the people of Israel. Galen often protested against violations of the Concordat to Hitler directly. In 1936, when the Nazis removed crucifixes from schools, Galen's protest led to a public demonstration. Together with Munich's Cardinal Faulhaber and Berlin's Bishop Preysing, Galen helped to draft Pope Pius XI's anti-Nazi encyclical Mit brennender Sorge (With Burning Concern) of 1937. In 1934, Bishop Galen began to attack the racial ideology of the Nazi regime, partly poking fun at it, partly critiquing its ideological basis as presented by the Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg. He declared it unacceptable to argue that Jewish authorship of the Old Testament diminished its authority, or that morality and virtue were in any way derived from the perceived usefulness of a particular race.Rudolf Morsey, Clemens August Kardinal von Galen ‚Äì Bisch√∂fliches Wirken in der Zeit der Hitler-Herrschaft. Landeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung, D√ºsseldorf 1987, p. 14 In January 1934, he criticized Nazi racial policy in a sermon and, in subsequent homilies, equated unquestioning loyalty to the Reich with \\"slavery\\". He spoke against Hitler's theory of the purity of German blood.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.59 Bishop Galen also derided the neo-pagan theories of Rosenberg in The Myth of the Twentieth Century as perhaps no more than \\"an occasion for laughter in the educated world\\", but warned that Rosenberg's \\"immense importance lies in the acceptance of his basic notions as the authentic philosophy of National Socialism and in his almost unlimited power in the field of German education. Herr Rosenberg must be taken seriously if the German situation is to be understood.\\"Richard Bonney; Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936‚Äì1939; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 ; p. 128 In retaliation, two senior SS officers visited Galen to pressure him into endorsing Rosenberg's doctrines publicly, threatening the confiscation of Church property and an anti-Catholic propaganda campaign. One of them was the future SS General J√ºrgen Stroop, who later recalled, \\"Bishop von Galen was a great gentleman, a true aristocrat, a Renaissance prince of the Church. He welcomed us politely but with reserve.\\"Kazimierz Moczarski (1981), Conversations with an Executioner, Prentice Hall, p. 56-57. Galen began by commending Stroop's mother for her devout Catholicism, then categorically refused to accept or praise Rosenberg's doctrines of euthanizing or forcibly sterilizing the disabled. He denounced the Nazis for trying to introduce Germanic neo-paganism into his diocese. He scoffed at marriage ceremonies and funerals conducted before altars dedicated to Wotan, surprising Stroop, who had attended such a ceremony only days before. Galen closed by assuring the officers that the Church would remain loyal to the state in all lawful matters. He expressed his deep love for Germany and reminded them that he had been the first bishop to publicly acknowledge the new regime. In Stroop's view, Galen's German patriotism \\"was tainted by Papist ideals, which have been harmful to Germany for centuries. Besides, the Archbishop's orders came from outside the Fatherland, a fact which disturbed us. We all know that despite its diverse factions, the Catholic Church is a world community, which sticks together when the chips are down.\\" In June 1935 he delivered a sermon that connected the heresy of the Anabaptists to the \\"sins of the Jews\\". He told his audience that \\"whoever does not listen to the Church is a heathen and officially is a sinner\\". He described how \\"the Israelites debased the Savior\\", and how people who resisted Jesus as the Christ appeared on the \\"side of the blinded Jews\\". He equated the rejection of Christianity with rejection of worldly authority, leading to anarchy and chaos. He pointed to the Russians also as among those who had not respected God-given authority. Galen did not protest the antisemitic 1935 Nuremberg Laws, or the Kristallnacht pogrom of 1938. Until his death, he refused to recognize that referring to Jews as \\"degenerate\\", \\"rejected\\", and \\"lost\\" or labeling anarchy or liberalism as \\"Jewish\\", in any way aided the Nazi regime or and its racist antisemitism.Griech-Polelle, Bishop von Galen. German Catholicism and National Socialism, p. 99, 108. By late 1935, Galen was urging a joint pastoral letter from the German bishops to protest about an \\"underground war\\" against the church.Theodore S. Hamerow. On the Road to the Wolf's Lair (1997), p. 139. By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with the Nazi government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical Mit brennender Sorge (With Burning Concern), accusing the Nazi government of violating the 1933 Concordat and of sowing the \\"tales of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\\".William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p. 234-235. Galen was part of the five-member commission that prepared the papal encyclical. The Nazis responded with an intensification of their campaign against the Catholic Church.Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Co; London; p. 381‚Äì82 There were mass arrests of clergy and church publishing houses were expropriated.Joachim Fest, Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933‚Äì1945, Weidenfeld & Nicolson; London; p.374 In 1941 Galen welcomed the German war against the USSR as a positive developmentPeter L√∂ffler (Hrsg.): Bischof Clemens August Graf von Galen ‚Äì Akten, Briefe und Predigten 1933‚Äì1946.

Hamerow, On the Road to the Wolf's Lair (1997), p. 262-263. Euthanasia Coat of Arms of Cardinal von Galen While the Nazi extermination of Jewish people took place primarily on Polish territory, the murder of people with disabilities (viewed by the nazi regime as \\"invalid\\" individuals) became public knowledge because it took place on German soil and interfered directly in Catholic and Protestant welfare institutions. Church leaders who opposed it ‚Äì chiefly Bishop Galen and Theophil Wurm, the Lutheran Bishop of W√ºrttemberg ‚Äì were able to rouse widespread public opposition.Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933‚Äì1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.24 The regime initiated its euthanasia program in 1939.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Blessed Clemens August, Graf von Galen; web Apr 2013 It targeted people with dementia, cognitive/mental disabilities, mental illness, epileptic, physical disabilities, children with Down's Syndrome and people with similar afflictions.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p. 60 The programme systematically murdered more than 70,000 people between September 1939 and August 1941. After 1941 the killing continued unofficially, with the total number of deaths estimated at 200,000.Michael Burleigh (1994), Death and Deliverance: 'Euthanasia' in Germany, C.1900 to 1945 CUP Archive, . In 1941, with the Wehrmacht still marching on Moscow, Galen, despite his long- time nationalist sympathies, denounced the lawlessness of the Gestapo, the confiscations of church properties, and the Nazi euthanasia programme.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Blessed Clemens August, Graf von Galen; web Apr 2013. He attacked the Gestapo for converting church properties to their own purposes ‚Äì including use as cinemas and brothels.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.60 He protested against the mistreatment of Catholics in Germany: the arrests and imprisonment without legal process, the suppression of monasteries, and the expulsion of religious orders. But his sermons went further than defending the church, he spoke of a moral danger to Germany from the regime's violations of basic human rights: \\"the right to life, to inviolability, and to freedom is an indispensable part of any moral social order\\", he said ‚Äì and any government that punishes without court proceedings \\"undermines its own authority and respect for its sovereignty within the conscience of its citizens\\". Galen said that it was the duty of Christians to resist the taking of human life, even if it meant losing their own lives.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica's Reflections on the Holocaust Hitler's order for the \\"Aktion T4\\" Euthanasia Programme was dated 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland. As word of the programme spread, protest grew, until finally, Bishop Galen delivered his famous August 1941 sermons denouncing the programme as \\"murder\\".Theodore S. Hamerow, On the Road to the Wolf's Lair (1997), p. 289-290. On 3 August 1941, in one of his series of denunciations, Galen declared:Library : The Bishop vs. the Nazis: Bl. Clemens von Galen in World War II Germany ‚Äì Catholic Culture 1941 sermons Galen's three powerful sermons of July and August 1941 earned him the nickname of the \\"Lion of M√ºnster\\". The sermons were printed and distributed illegally. Hitler wanted to have Galen removed as a bishop, but Goebbels told him this would result in the loss of the loyalty of Westphalia. The sermons protested against Nazi policies on Gestapo terror, euthanasia, forced sterilization, and concentration camps.Allen, John L., Cardinal Ratzinger, p. 26, Continuum International Publishingh 2000 His attacks on the Nazis were so severe that Nazi official Walter Tiessler proposed in a letter to Martin Bormann that the Bishop be executed. On 13 July 1941, Galen attacked the regime for its Gestapo tactics of terror, including disappearances without trial, the closure of Catholic institutions without any stated justifications, and the resultant fear imposed on all Germans. The Gestapo, he argued, reduced even the most decent and loyal citizens to fear of ending up in a cellar prison or a concentration camp. Even though the country was at war, Galen rejected the notion that his speech undermined German solidarity or unity. Quoting Pope Pius XII's Opus Justitiae Pax and Justitia fundamentum Regnorum, Galen noted that \\"Peace is the work of Justice and Justice, the basis for dominion\\", then attacked the Third Reich for undermining justice, the belief in justice and for reducing the German people to a state of permanent fear, even cowardice. He concluded: \\"As a German, as a decent citizen, I demand Justice\\".Peter L√∂ffler (Hrsg.): Bischof Clemens August Graf von Galen ‚Äì Akten, Briefe und Predigten 1933‚Äì1946. Ferdinand Sch√∂ningh, Paderborn/Munich/Vienna/Zurich, 2nd edition 1996, p. 843 ff. In a second sermon on 20 July 1941, Galen said that all written protests against the Nazi hostilities had proved to be useless. The confiscation of religious institutions continued unabated. Members of religious orders were still being deported or jailed. He asked his listeners to be patient and to endure, and said that the German people were being destroyed not by the Allied bombing from the outside, but from negative forces within.Peter L√∂ffler (Hrsg.): Bischof Clemens August Graf von Galen ‚Äì Akten, Briefe und Predigten 1933‚Äì1946. Ferdinand Sch√∂ningh, Paderborn/Munich/Vienna/Zurich, 2nd edition 1996, p. 855 ff. On 3 August 1941, Galen's third sermon described the continued desecration of Catholic churches, the closing of convents and monasteries, and the deportation of mentally ill people to undisclosed destinations, while a notice was sent to family members stating that the person in question had died. This is murder, he exclaimed, unlawful by divine and German law, a rejection of the laws of God. He said he had forwarded his evidence to the State Attorney. \\"These are people, our brothers and sisters; maybe their life is unproductive, but productivity is not a justification for killing.\\" If that were indeed a justification for execution, he reasoned, everybody would have to be afraid to even go to a doctor for fear of what might be discovered. The social fabric would be affected. Galen then remarked that a regime which can do away with the Fifth Commandment (\\"Thou shalt not kill.\\") can destroy the other commandments as well.Peter L√∂ffler (Hrsg.): Bischof Clemens August Graf von Galen ‚Äì Akten, Briefe und Predigten 1933‚Äì1946. Ferdinand Sch√∂ningh, Paderborn/Munich/Vienna/Zurich, 2nd edition 1996, p. 874 ff. Galen went on to raise the question of whether permanently injured German soldiers would fall under the programme as well. Thousands of copies of the sermons were circulated throughout Germany. The resulting local protests in Germany broke the secrecy that had surrounded the euthanasia programme known as Aktion T4.Winfried S√º√ü: Bischof von Galen und die nationalsozialistische \\"Euthanasie\\". In: zur debatte 2005, S. 18 f. Onlineausgabe The local Nazi Gauleiter was furious and demanded Galen's immediate arrest. Joseph Goebbels and party pragmatists preferred to wait until the end of hostilities to avoid undermining German morale in a heavily Catholic area.Joachim Kuropka: Clemens August Graf von Galen (1878‚Äì1946) ‚Äì Ein gro√üer Niedersachse. Begleitheft zur Ausstellung im Nieders√§chsischen Landtag 10. bis 19. Juni 1992, p. 5 f. A year later, the euthanasia programme was still active, but the regime was conducting it in greater secrecy. According to Robert Jay Lifton, \\"[t]his powerful, populist sermon was immediately reproduced and distributed throughout Germany ‚Äî indeed, it was dropped among German troops by British Royal Air Force flyers. Galen's sermon probably had a greater impact than any other one statement in consolidating anti-'euthanasia' sentiment.\\"Robert Jay Lifton, Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide, p. 94. Howard K. Smith called Galen \\"heroic\\", writing that the movement he represented was so widespread that the Nazi government could not arrest the bishop. Ian Kershaw called Galen's \\"open attack\\" on the government's euthanasia programme in 1941 a \\"vigorous denunciation of Nazi inhumanity and barbarism\\".Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Co; London; pp. 210‚Äì11 According to Anton Gill, \\"Galen used his condemnation of this appalling policy to draw wider conclusions about the nature of the Nazi state.\\" The sermons inspired various people in the German Resistance. The L√ºbeck martyrs distributed the sermons.Eduard M√ºller; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 The sermons influenced the Scholl siblings in founding the White Rose pacifist student resistance group.Anton Gill, An Honourable Defeat: A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London, 1994, p.188 One of von Galen's sermons of 1941 was the group's first pamphlet.The White Rose Shoah Education Project Web Generalmajor Hans Oster, a devout Lutheran and a leading member of the German Resistance, once said of Galen:Philipp Freiherr von Boeselager, Valkyrie: The Story of the Plot to Kill Hitler, by its Last Member, Vintage Books, 2009. p. 70. Galen suffered virtual house arrest from 1941 until the end of the war. Documents suggest the Nazis intended to hang him at the end of the war. In a Table Talk from 1942, Hitler said: \\"The fact that I remain silent in public over Church affairs is not in the least misunderstood by the sly foxes of the Catholic Church, and I am quite sure that a man like Bishop von Galen knows full well that after the war I shall extract retribution to the last farthing\\".Hitler's Table Talk 1941‚Äì1944, Cameron & Stevens, Enigma Books, p. 90, 555. In his history of the German Resistance, Theodore S. Hamerow characterised the resistance approach of Galen as \\"trying to influence the Third Reich from within\\". While some clergymen refused ever to feign support for the regime, in the Church's conflict with the State over ecclesiastical autonomy, the Catholic hierarchy adopted a strategy of \\"seeming acceptance of the Third Reich\\", by couching their criticisms as motivated merely by a desire to \\"point out mistakes that some of its overzealous followers committed\\" in order to strengthen the government.Theodore S. Hamerow, On the Road to the Wolf's Lair (1997), p. 198. Thus when Bishop Galen delivered his famous 1941 denunciations of Nazi euthanasia and the lawlessness of the Gestapo, he also said that the church had never sought the \\"overthrow\\" of the regime.Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; The German Resistance to Hitler; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; p. 225 Post-war positions After the war, Galen protested against the mistreatment of the German population by the Allied occupation forces. On 13 April 1945, he raised a protest with American military authorities against the rape of German women by Russian soldiers and the plundering of German homes, factories, and offices by American and British troops.Portmann, p. 234.Beevor, Antony 'They raped every German female from eight to 80', dated 1 May 2002, in The Guardian In a joint interview with British officials, Galen told the international press that \\"just as I fought against Nazi injustices, I will fight any injustice, no matter where it comes from\\".Portmann, p. 237. He repeated these claims in a sermon on 1 July 1945, which was copied and distributed throughout occupied Germany. The British authorities ordered him to renounce it immediately, but he refused.Portmann, p. 239. In the face of his resistance and broad popularity, they allowed him free speech without any censorship. In an interview with Swiss media, Galen demanded punishment for Nazi criminals but humane treatment for the millions of German prisoners of war who had not committed any crimes and who were being denied contact with their relatives by the British. He criticized the British dismissal of Germans from public service without investigation and trial.Portmann, p. 245. He forcefully condemned the expulsion of German civilians from former German provinces and territories in the east annexed by communist Poland and the Soviet Union. When SS-General Kurt Meyer, accused of complicity in the shooting of eighteen Canadian prisoners of war, was sentenced to death, Galen pleaded for his life to be spared: \\"According to what has been reported to me, General Kurt Meyer was sentenced to death because his subordinates committed crimes he didn't arrange and of which he did not approve. As a proponent of Christian legal opinion, which states that you are only responsible for your own deeds, I support the plea for clemency for General Meyer and pledge for a pardon.\\" On second review, a Canadian general, finding only \\"a mass of circumstantial evidence\\", commuted Meyer's death sentence to imprisonment.Meyer served nine years in British and Canadian POW prisons. Portmann, p. 246. College of Cardinals Unexpectedly, at Christmas 1945 it became known that Pope Pius XII would appoint three new German cardinals: Bishop Clemens August von Galen, Bishop Konrad von Preysing of Berlin, and Archbishop Josef Frings of Cologne. Despite numerous British obstacles and denial of air travel, Galen arrived in Rome 5 February 1946.Portmann, p. 264‚Äì265. Generous American cardinals financed his Roman stay, as German money was not in demand. He had become famous and popular, so after the pope had placed the red hat on his head with the words: 'God bless you, God bless Germany', Saint Peter's Basilica for minutes thundered in a \\"triumphant applause\\" for Galen.Portmann, p. 290. While in Rome, he visited the German POW camps in Taranto and told the German Wehrmacht soldiers that he would take care of their release, and that the Pope himself was working on the release of POWs. He took a large number of comforting personal messages to their worried families.Portmann, p. 296‚Äì297. After receiving the red hat, Galen went to see Madre Pascalina, the faithful servant of the Pope. He told her how the Pope had quoted long passages from Galen's 1941 sermons from memory and how the Pope thanked him for his courage. Galen told the Pope, \\"Yes, Holy Father, but many of my very best priests died in concentration camps, because they distributed my sermons.\\" Pius replied that he was always aware that thousands of innocent persons would have been sent to certain death if he as pope had protested. They talked about the old days in Berlin, and Galen declared: \\"for nothing in the world would I want to have missed those two hours, not even for the red hat.\\"Pascalina Lehnert, Ich durfte Ihm dienen, W√ºrzburg, 1988, p. 151 The tomb of Clemens August Cardinal von Galen in M√ºnster Cathedral Death and beatification Following his return from the wearisome travel to Vatican City, the new cardinal was celebrated enthusiastically in his native Westphalia and in his destroyed city of M√ºnster, which still lay completely in ruins as a result of the air raids. He died a few days after his return from Rome in the St. Franziskus Hospital of M√ºnster due to an appendix infection diagnosed too late. His last words were:Gottfried Hasenkamp, Heimkehr und Heimgang des Kardinals, a.a.O., S. 13 \\"Yes, Yes, as God wills it. May God reward you for it. May God protect the dear fatherland. Go on working for him... oh, you dear Saviour!\\" He was buried in the family crypt of the Galen family in the destroyed Cathedral of M√ºnster. The cause for beatification was requested by his successor, Bishop Michael Keller of M√ºnster and began under Pope Pius XII in 1956. It was concluded positively in November 2004 under Pope John Paul II. Clemens August Graf von Galen was beatified on 9 October 2005 outside St. Peter's Basilica by Pope Benedict XVI, the 47th anniversary of the death of Pope Pius (1958). Terminology note * Graf is a German title rendered as Count in English, not a first or middle name. The use of von before the family name Galen is indicative of this status. The noble particle (or preposition) von is traditionally dropped in prose when using the family name without the given name or the title Graf. ‚Äì If Graf is recognized as a title of non-reigning nobility (and not as a mere part of the name as officially the case after 1919 in Germany), then it is surpassed by the title of Cardinal and thus not used together with it.

It was created in 1958 by the amalgamation of the West Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own) (14th Foot) and the East Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of York's Own) (15th Foot). After 48 years service, the regiment was amalgamated again, this time with two other Yorkshire regiments. It became the 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th, 33rd and 76th Foot), with the Green Howards (19th Foot) forming the 2nd Battalion and the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (33rd/76th Foot) forming the 3rd Battalion on 6 June 2006. Following further merges, in 2012, the battalion was redesignated as the new 2nd Battalion (2Yorks) . Formation and name The Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire was formed on 25 April 1958 by the amalgamation of The West Yorkshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's Own) (14th Foot) and The East Yorkshire Regiment (The Duke of York's Own) (15th Foot). History The first overseas posting for the regiment was from September 1958 to June 1959 in the Colony of Aden (present day, part of Yemen), followed by a posting to Gibraltar from June 1959 to June 1961. The battalion served in Wuppertal, West Germany from 1961 to 1964, Berlin 1964-1965, then again in Aden from September 1965 until September 1966. The regiment returned to England in 1966 and was based in Colchester. In 1967, operational elements were deployed to Cornwall to help with the environmental clean-up after the Torrey Canyon oil spill. An emergency deployment back to Aden in June following the mutinies by the South Arabian Federation Army and Yemen Federal Police. Aden saw the deaths in action of two soldiers from the regiment, Pte F langrick and Sgt WS Saville, as well as the awards of one Military Cross, one Military Medal, and a Mention In Despatches. The battalion returned to Colchester in late 1967. In April 1969, the battalion was deployed to Northern Ireland, as part of the UK Government's response to terrorist attacks on the Government infrastructure in the province. The regiment's presence and constant patrolling of vital points initially stabilised the situation in their operational area of County Down. On 12 July, sectarian violence led to a rapid redeployment to Derry. Decisive action by the Royal Ulster Constabulary again calmed the situation down and the battalion moved into a fixed tactical base at Magilligan's Point, north of Limavady on the shores of Lough Foyle. On 12 August, the violence erupted in a concerted campaign, which, after nearly three days of street battles, saw the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) totally exhausted. On 14 August 1969, the regiment took over responsibility for the security of Derry. From February 1970 to October 1972, the battalion was based in Cyprus, then returned to the UK, for another tour in Northern Ireland, until November 1973. From November 1973 until May 1974, the regiment was stationed in Dover, Kent. From 1974 to 1978, the regiment was stationed in Celle (formerly in West Germany), as part of the 7th Armoured Brigade. The battalion completed another four month emergency tour in Derry during 1975. During this tour, 18-year-old Pte David Wray was shot and killed by a sniper whilst on a foot patrol in the Creggan housing estate. From 1978 to 1983, the regiment served as part of the Allied Mobile Force. In May 1983, the battalion started a two-year tour as part of the Berlin Brigade, where in 1984 it was presented with new regimental Colours. In April 1985, the battalion redeployed to Abercorn Barracks, Ballykinler, Northern Ireland and was heavily committed in domestic duties, maintaining law and order, particularly in the terrorist plagued countryside of South Armagh. In May 1987, the battalion moved to Catterick, North Yorkshire, to join 24 Infantry Brigade. Equipped with Saxon armoured personnel carriers, this was the battalion's first tour in Yorkshire since their antecedent regiments amalgamation. In 1988, the battalion re-roled as an airmobile unit in line with 24 Infantry Brigade's conversion to 24 Airmobile Brigade. In August 1990, the battalion moved to Osnabr√ºck in West Germany to take up a Mechanised Infantry role as part of 12 Armoured Brigade. During the First Gulf War, or Operation Granby (later known as Desert storm), the battalion deployed formed units that included a Milan Section and a Mortar section to the 1st battalion of the Staffordshire Regiment, many men deployed on an individual basis reinforcing units. Some 149 personnel of all ranks were deployed to the gulf. During Winter 1991, the battalion was once again in Northern Ireland, as the west Belfast roulement battalion. As a result of the 1992 Strategic Defence Review, the then government of John Major decided to bring Territorial Army (TA) and Regular Army units closer together; as a result, the 2nd Battalion The Yorkshire Volunteers became 3rd Battalion The Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire (Yorkshire Volunteers). The 3rd Battalion was based at York. 3PWO lasted until 1998. In 1993, the regiment deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of UNPFOR, with companies in Gornji Vakuf and Vitez. They picked up the unofficial nickname of \\"ShootBat\\" due to the 'robustness' of the battalion's actions. In 1994, the battalion moved to the British Army Training Unit Suffield, Canada followed by a move to Warminster as the Infantry Demonstration Battalion at the Land Warfare Centre. 1997 saw the battalion stationed in Chester with deployments to Ulster, Sierra Leone (Operation Basilica) support to Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food during the foot and mouth outbreak. Training exercises took troops to Kenya, Jamaica, Italy and Oman. By 2001-2003, 1PWO was in Omagh followed by a move to Catterick Garrison as an Air Assault Battalion, with deployments to Bosnia, as part of SFOR and a training exercise to Belize in 2005. The regiment amalgamated with its sister battalions of The Green Howards and The Duke of Wellington's Regiment to form The Yorkshire Regiment on 6 June 2006.

She has been affiliated with the TVB television station until the mid-1990s but has performed for Asia Television on several occasions since 1995.  Personal life  Tsui is the oldest of six children, with three brothers and two sisters. After graduating high school, she worked at her father's salon as a nail technician and hairstylist. According to HK magazine, Paula Tsui was born in Hubei, but her family moved to Hong Kong when she was still a baby, therefore, all of her memory is about Hong Kong.Yeung 2010 Tsui recalls her childhood of being a mischievous girl. She thinks of herself as hard to control and was definitely not a good kid. For example, she only enjoyed music classes, because she thought singing was so natural to her. However, when her class teacher asked her to sing the school hymns, she rejected and ended up singing pop songs. She believes that her rebellious attitude came about because she never knew what she wanted to do, and that makes her memory of youth so unclear, she only remembers frequently changing jobs. The thing that changed her life was a singing contest when Tsui entered one in 1965. Initially, she was reluctant to join the competition, but her friends kept persuading her, and said that they would not participate without Tsui. Then finally, Tsui won that contest came out the champion. At the same time, Tsui's parents did not approve of her becoming a singer, because they thought musically performing was a shameful career, and that is the reason why Tsui refused to let her family see her performances. However, Tsui promised her family that she would not change her mind and principles. Finally her family agreed with her choice to become a singer. Tsui felt so grateful to her parents reluctance and from it came a promise with her family to become a successful singer. Show business had a lot of temptations and this promise kept a firm focus on her singing. Tsui is private about her personal life, especially in regards to her romantic life. It was not until the 1990s that was discovered that she had been secretly married to Hong Kong radio host and legislator Albert Cheng between 1975 and 1979. Tsui was then already a renowned singer, while Cheng was still relatively unknown at that time. Tsui currently resides in Canada.  Career  After winning a contest in 1966, she soon began performing. She started at lounges and eventually at nightclubs as a supporting act placed between better known performers. During that time, Tsui performed over 400 songs, she did not set out to learn all the songs, but she eventually memorised them all. That's the reason why a lot of people think she has a personal high standard, but she do not think like that. She thought that doing her best was a basic requirement. Even though a lot of people told her that she was famous, she never considered herself popular because she thought it would put too much pressure on herself. A record label executive was in the audience during one of her nightclub performances and offered her a contract with a handsome price. After signing the contract, Tsui was not allowed to perform in nightclubs again. Tsui is popularly renown with her jaw- dropping gowns on-stage. As a result, she is very conscientious about what she wears on stage and is very careful in selecting her clothes. If she does not approve of her outfit, she will not show it to anyone. She thinks that big dresses on stage is for effect, therefore, she does not care about the weight of the dresses. Tsui will practice walking in the dresses until she feels comfortable with the excess weight. Paradoxically, though she cares about the clothes, she also wants the audiences to focus on her music performance rather than the clothing she wears. Even though her stage clothes are all well- fitting, Tsui is not a picky eater, she loves food, and when she faces pressure, she likes eating chocolates and sweets to release stress. In recent years, Tsui has lowered her television appearances and other public events. Many have assumed she has retired, but she maintains that she never will want to retire. In 2016, she had another concert, which completely ditched her elegant and extravagant gowns and costumes.  Concerts  According to Guinness World Records in 2003, Tsui's Amway Paula Tsui in Concert 1992 holds the record for the most number of \\"single event\\" concerts in a continuous period (43 concerts in 37 days) in Asia. She gave another series of concerts at the same venue, the Hong Kong Coliseum in summer 2005. Tsui is noted for the voluminous gowns she wears for concert appearances. Also, for that reason, she has never worn in-ear monitors in her career. Partly because the technology was not as advanced as it is now, partly because it seemed odd to her elegant image.

He served as Premier of Victoria (1902‚Äì1904), Attorney- General of Australia (1913‚Äì1914), and Chief Justice of Victoria (1918‚Äì1935). Early life Irvine was born in Newry in County Down, Ireland, into a Scottish-Presbyterian family; he was the nephew of Irish revolutionary John Mitchel. He was educated at the Royal School, Armagh and Trinity College, Dublin, graduating in law in 1879 before migrating to Melbourne, where he taught in Presbyterian schools and read law at Melbourne University, gaining a master's degree in arts and law. He soon became a leading Melbourne barrister.Biography ‚Äì Sir William Hill Irvine ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography Victorian politics In 1894, Irvine was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as a liberal. He was Attorney-General 1899‚Äì1900 and 1902‚Äì03 and Solicitor-General in 1903. He succeeded George Turner as leader of the Victorian Liberals, but was much more conservative than either Turner or the federal Protectionist Party leader, Alfred Deakin. In 1902, he displaced the more liberal Alexander Peacock and became Premier and Treasurer, holding office until 1904, when he was succeeded by Thomas Bent. Irvine's ministry was appointed on 10 June 1902: * Premier and Attorney-General : William Irvine * Treasurer : William Shiels * Solicitor-General : John Mark Davies * Minister of Railways : Thomas Bent * Minister of Education and Health : Robert Reid * Minister of Public Works and Agriculture : Mr. Taverner * President of Board of Lands : Mr. McKenzie * Minister of Mines : Mr. Cameron * Chief Secretary and Minister of Labour : Mr. Murray Federal politics In 1906, Irvine was elected to the Australian House of Representatives for the seat of Flinders. First elected as an independent Protectionist, he became a member of Deakin's Commonwealth Liberal Party in 1908. He was Attorney-General in Joseph Cook's Liberal government of 1913‚Äì14. He was considered a potential Prime Minister of Australia, but his abrupt manner and hard-line conservatism made him unacceptable to many Liberals; in Parliament he was known as \\"Iceberg Irvine.\\" Judicial career Sir William Irvine, by Ernest Buckmaster, Art Gallery of New South Wales. Winner of the Archibald Prize in 1932 Recognising this, Irvine accepted the appointment as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, which is the highest ranking court in the Australian State of Victoria. He held this position from 1918 until 1935. Other activities He was knighted KCMG in 1914 and made GCMG in 1936. A keen motorist, he was a founding member of the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) and was its patron from 1938 through 1943.

The book maintains popularity in East Tennessee, with about 20 singings in 2004. Publication background Marcus Lafayette Swan was born in Knoxville in 1827, the son of prominent lawyer William H. Swan, Jr. (1798-1859).Ron Petersen and Candra Phillips, \\"East Tennessee Harp Singing,\\" Introduction to the 1978 reprinting of The New Harp of Columbia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1978), pp. xviii-xxx.Elizabeth Dunham, Finding Aid for the Hannah W.

In 1847, his father married Hannah Wells Crozier, who hailed from a prominent family of Knoxville politicians and businesspeople. The Croziers' business enterprises included a printing company, Crozier & Barton, which had published hymn books as early as 1825, and thus may have inspired the Swans to publish their own collection of songs. The Harp of Columbia, published by the Swans as a singing school manual in 1848, was moderately successful, and was reprinted several times during the 1850s. During the Civil War, Marcus Swan supported the Confederacy, and fled to Bellefonte, Alabama, when the Union Army occupied Knoxville. While living in Bellefonte, he wrote the introduction to The New Harp of Columbia, which was published in Knoxville in 1867. By the time of his death, Swan had amassed a relatively large fortune. The New Harp of Columbia has been reprinted numerous times since its initial publication. Musicologist Dorothy Horn suggests the success of The New Harp is due to its excellent printing and its larger than normal sample of standard tunes favored by various Protestant denominations. Contents The New Harp of Columbia contains a unique seven- shape system devised by the Swans, which differs from the \\"standard\\" seven- shape notation developed by songmaster Jesse B. Aikin during the same period. Marcus Swan kept much of the material from The Harp of Columbia, but also included several tunes by popular hymn composer Lowell Mason and several of his own compositions. A 2001 \\"Restored Edition\\" of The New Harp adds a section of 39 pages of tunes from the 1848 Harp of Columbia which were not included in the original New Harp of Columbia. The songs in The New Harp come from both European (especially English and Scottish) and American singing traditions. Along with Swan's compositions, The New Harp includes songs such as \\"Coronation\\" by Oliver Holden, \\"Easter Anthem\\" and \\"Rose of Sharon\\" by William Billings, \\"Creation\\" by Nehemiah Shumway, \\"Arlington\\" by Thomas Arne, and \\"Duke Street\\" by John Hatton. The book also includes a number of folk hymns, such as \\"Promised Land,\\" \\"Idumea,\\" and \\"Golden Hill.\\" Several tunes were derived from European folk songs, such as \\"Hamburg\\" (derived from \\"Auld Lang Syne\\"), \\"Bruce's Address\\" (from \\"Scots Wha Hae\\"), and \\"Marston\\" (from \\"Farmer in the Dell\\").

The castle fortifications and outbuildings were built around 1100, and the keep around 1140. However, the keep is the only major medieval structure that has survived, albeit less two turrets. The keep is open to the public. Description The manor of Hedingham was awarded to Aubrey de Vere I by William the Conqueror by 1086. The castle was constructed by the de Veres in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, and the keep in the 1130s and 1140s. To accommodate the existing castle, a large ditch was cut through a natural spur westward into the Colne Valley in order to form a ringwork and inner bailey; an outer bailey extended south further into the valley and what is now the modern village of Castle Hedingham. The stone keep is the only mediaeval structure to survive, and is in an excellent state of preservation. The keep is nearly square, a common shape for Norman keeps. The east and west sides are long and the north-south sides about . The main part of the keep stands more than tall, and the turrets rise an additional above the parapets, commanding the countryside around it from its elevated position atop the ringwork. The walls are about thick at the base and average thick at the top. They are constructed from flint rubble bound with lime mortar, but, very unusually for an Essex castle, are faced with ashlar stone transported from a quarry in Barnack, Northamptonshire. The keep has five floors including the Great or Banqueting Hall with a great fireplace and a central arch extending two stories. The top floor may have been added around the 15th century, replacing an impressive pyramid-shaped roof. This is a recent theory, however, and many older sources have noted the similar plans of Hedingham Castle and Rochester Castle, which was begun about 1126 and has four floors and four turrets. Floor plans of the keep from The Growth of the English House by John Alfred Gotch, 1909. Changes were made in subsequent years, particularly during the Tudor period. Two of the original four corner turrets are missing. It seems likely, however, that their demise was an attempt to demolish the building for materials rather than a result of military action. The outer buildings, including the hall, drawbridge and others, were replaced during the Tudor period. However, those structures have now also been lost. The only exception is the red-brick bridge of four spans that connects the inner bailey to the outer bailey, lying to the north-east of the keep. The bridge was built in the late 15th or early 16th century and has been restored several times. A chapel was previously located to the south of the stone keep within the inner bailey. Around 1700, a Queen Anne style red-brick mansion was built in the outer bailey by Sir William Ashhurst, an MP and a former Lord Mayor of London. This was built sometime between his purchase of the property in 1693 and his death in 1719. History Hedingham Castle may occupy the site of an earlier castle believed to have been built in the late 11th or early 12th century by Aubrey de Vere I, a Norman baron. Hedingham was one of the largest manors among those acquired by Aubrey I. The Domesday Book records that he held the manor of Hedingham by 1086, and he ordered that vineyards be planted. It became the head of the Vere barony. Aubrey II and Aubrey III are candidates for initiating the construction of a major stone tower at Hedingham, possibly to reflect the enhanced status of the family.D. F. Renn, Norman Castles in Britain (1973), 18-20. In 1133 Aubrey II, son and heir of the first Aubrey, was created master chamberlain of England by Henry I. In 1141, his son and heir Aubrey was granted an earldom by Empress Matilda. By that time he had been Count of Guines for several years by right of his wife's inheritance of that continental territory. Matilda, wife of King Stephen, died at Castle Hedingham on 3 May 1152. The castle was besieged twice, in 1216 and 1217, during the dispute between King John, rebel barons, and the French prince. (In both cases the sieges were short and successful for those besieging the castle). The castle was held by the de Vere family until 1625. Among the more famous earls are Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford; Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford; John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford; and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, suspected by some to be the writer of the works commonly ascribed to William Shakespeare. Recent history In 1713 the castle was purchased by Sir William Ashhurst; after his death in 1720, the estate passed to his great- granddaughter, Margaret Elizabeth Lindsay, the wife of Lewis Majendie. The Majendie family owned Hedingham Castle for 250 years until Miss Musette Majendie left it to her cousin, The Honourable Thomas Lindsay, descended from the de Veres through both maternal and paternal lines. His son Jason Lindsay and wife Demetra now live at Hedingham Castle with their children. Present day use While Hedingham Castle remains a family home, the Norman keep and grounds are open to the public from Easter to October. Educational school visits take place throughout the year. Today the castle is a venue for a range of events, including jousting, archery, falconry, re-enactment battles, fairs, classic and vintage car shows, music concerts and theatre productions. Hedingham Castle is currently used for wedding ceremonies and corporate or private parties. Weddings are held by candlelight in the keep with space for 100 seated guests and standing room in the Minstrels‚Äô gallery. Civil ceremonies, Civil Partnerships, Renewal of Vows and Naming ceremonies are all permitted. The Queen Anne mansion house and marquee are used for wedding receptions and parties. The castle has been described as \\"the best preserved Norman keep in England.\\" Filming and photography Hedingham Castle was the location for episode 2 of The Landscape of Man aired on Channel 4 in 2010 in which the castle grounds and gardens, which had been left to become a wilderness throughout the 20th century, were restored. The castle has also been a location for the feature film The Reckoning starring Willem Dafoe and Paul Bettany and for the BBC drama Ivanhoe. The documentaries Made in Britain with Fred Dibnah, The Shakespeare Theory with Sir Derek Jacobi and A History of Britain with Simon Schama have used Hedingham Castle as a location. The castle also appeared in a photo-shoot for Vanity Fair featuring Alexander McQueen and Isabella Blow; the photograph can be seen hanging in the National Portrait Gallery, London.

The name M√ºhlburg could be translated as 'Mill Castle' and refers to a water mill and a water castle located at the site where a Roman road once crossed the small river Alb. History M√ºhlburg was first mentioned in 1248, when it was referred to as Mulenberc. In 1258 there was the first mention of a castle owned by Rudolf I, Margrave of Baden. In 1274 M√ºhlburg was, like many neighbouring settlements, occupied by Rudolph of Habsburg. In 1670 M√ºhlburg received town privileges and, just a few years before Karlsruhe, it was issued a \\"letter of freedom\\", which relaxed the requirements for craftsmen and new citizens to settle in the town. It is believed that the Margraves of Baden planned to expand M√ºhlburg. Any such plans came to a halt in 1689, when M√ºhlburg and its castle were destroyed by French troops during the Nine Years' War following the orders of Louis XIV of France to destroy the margravate of Baden (\\"Ruinez les pays de Bade\\"). The castle was never rebuilt thereafter and the ruins of the castle were used as building material for a newly founded palace nearby, out of which the future city of Karlsruhe would develop. M√ºhlburg finally became a borough of Karlsruhe in 1886. Notable people M√ºhlburg is the birthplace of Karl Benz (1844‚Äì1929), inventor of the automobile and founder of Benz & Cie.

It has several versions with quite different content. One of these was selected by Vasile Alecsandri to form the textbook reference. Content The setting is a simple one: three shepherds (a Moldavian, a Transylvanian and a Vr√¢ncean) meet while looking after their flocks. An apparently enchanted ewe belonging to the Moldavian tells its master that the other two are plotting to murder him and steal his goods. The shepherd replies that, were this to happen, the ewe is to ask his killers to bury his body by the sheep's pen. She is to then tell the rest of his sheep that he had married a princess during a ceremony attended by the elements of nature, and marked by the falling of a star. However, there is no rite of passage metaphor with heavenly manifestations in the version of the story the ewe is to tell the shepherd's mother: she is to hear only of her son having married a princess. This poem was quoted extensively by Patrick Leigh Fermor in his account of the second part of a journey on foot from Holland to Constantinople in 1933-34. He includes a partial translation which he refers to as \\"ramshackle but pretty accurate\\". This was actually made later during an extended stay prior to September 1939 in eastern Romania.

Because salinity (in concert with temperature) affects the density of seawater, it can play a role in its vertical stratification. Increasing salinity by one kg/m3 results in an increase of seawater density of around 0.7 kg/m3.  Description  In the midlatitudes, an excess of evaporation over precipitation leads to surface waters being saltier than deep waters. In such regions, the vertical stratification is due to surface waters being warmer than deep waters and the halocline is destabilizing. Such regions may be prone to salt fingering, a process which results in the preferential mixing of salinity. In certain high latitude regions (such as the Arctic Ocean, Bering Sea, and the Southern Ocean) the surface waters are actually colder than the deep waters and the halocline is responsible for maintaining water column stability, isolating the surface waters from the deep waters. In these regions, the halocline is important in allowing for the formation of sea ice, and limiting the escape of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Haloclines are also found in fjords, and poorly mixed estuaries where fresh water is deposited at the ocean surface. A halocline can be easily created and observed in a drinking glass or other clear vessel. If fresh water is slowly poured over a quantity of salt water, using a spoon held horizontally at water-level to prevent mixing, a hazy interface layer, the halocline, will soon be visible due to the varying index of refraction across the boundary. A halocline is most commonly confused with a thermocline ‚Äì a thermocline is an area within a body of water that marks a drastic change in temperature. A halocline can coincide with a thermocline and form a pycnocline. Haloclines are common in water-filled limestone caves near the ocean. Less dense fresh water from the land forms a layer over salt water from the ocean. For underwater cave explorers, this can cause the optical illusion of air space in caverns. Passing through the halocline tends to stir up the layers.  Graph  Plot of temperature and salinity in the Arctic Ocean at 85,18 north and 117,28 east dated Jan. 1st 2010. In the graphical representation, three layers can be discerned: * About of low salinity water \\"swimming\\" on top of the ocean. The temperature is , which is very near to the freezing point. This layer blocks heat transfer from the warmer, deeper levels into the sea ice, which has considerable effect on its thickness. * About of steeply rising salinity and increasing temperature.

Biography LaRocque started in the Swedish hard rock band Swedish Beauty, which later changed its name to Swedish Erotica. He also played on the Death album Individual Thought Patterns and the IllWill album Evilution, along with former members of Mercyful Fate. He can be heard on other albums as well, such as Falconer's Chapters from a Vale Forlorn, where he performed lead guitars on the song \\"Busted to the Floor\\". LaRocque contributed a guitar solo to the track \\"Cold\\" on the album Slaughter of the Soul by Swedish melodic death metal group At the Gates. Producer Fredrik Nordstr√∂m was responsible for the idea, and telephoned LaRocque. At the Gates' guitarist Anders Bj√∂rler gave LaRocque an audio cassette recording of the song. The tape played at the wrong speed at LaRocque's house, so LaRocque had to transcribe the recording. Two days after receiving the cassette, LaRocque laid down a guitar solo for the song within half an hour. Bj√∂rler described the solo as \\"great\\" and in a November 2007 interview admitted he still couldn't play the solo \\"properly\\". LaRocque opened a studio called the \\"Los Angered Recordings\\" in Angered, Sweden in 1995, where he produced and recorded albums for many bands. In 2007, he moved the studio to Varberg and renamed it \\"Sonic Train Studios\\" where he continues to record and produce for various rock and heavy metal bands. He is well known for his signature guitar style incorporating neoclassical elements into his playing, specially by using exotic scales such as harmonic minor, phrygian dominant, and diminished minor scale. His extended theory knowledge enables him to mix these neo-classical scales with others such as blues scale or melodic minor. He has a very distinct guitar tone for his solos, and often incorporates layers of harmonies over his scale runs and phrasing. He frequently uses a mixture of classically-flavored arpeggio sequences and alternate picked scale runs intermixed with melody lines to create his signature style. LaRocque was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2007. He is regularly listed as among the best or most underrated guitarists in heavy metal. He cites Michael Schenker and Randy Rhoads as major influences. He also likes Steve Vai and Tony Iommi, and was impressed by the friendliness of Chuck Schuldiner when he recorded Individual Thought Patterns with him. Discography=With E.F.

(; ) is an Italian telecommunications company, based in Cagliari, Sardinia, that provides internet and telecommunications services to its domestic market. It previously had operations in other European nations through its acquisition of many smaller European Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the late 1990s. History Tiscali Campus in Cagliari Tiscali Campus in Cagliari Tiscali was created in January 1998 in Cagliari by Renato Soru, following the deregulation of Italian telephone system. The company owes its name to a Sardinian mountain at which remains of an ancient village were found. From March 1999 onward, Tiscali offered Tiscali Free Net, a subscription-free Internet service where customers only had to pay for the time they were online. This pushed other Italian providers to repeal their fixed subscription fees, thus contributing to making the Internet accessible to the masses in Italy. IPO In October 1999 (during the dot-com bubble), the company went through an initial public offering (IPO) to be traded on the Italian stock exchange at a share price of 46 Euros. 3,098,000 shares were offered to investors of which 2,658,000 shares were created through a capital increase and the rest were sold by Soru. Soru made 20,240,000 Euros on the IPO. In 2012, the price per share had plummeted to 0.04 Euros. Between 2001 and 2003, shares were also traded on the French stock exchange. Services Each of Tiscali's regional companies offer many services, which may include broadband internet access and telephone services. Between 2007 and 2008, Tiscali briefly operated an IPTV service in Italy (available in the cities of Bologna, Cagliari, Florence, Genoa, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Rome, Turin and Trieste). Its UK television service, Tiscali TV was acquired by TalkTalk in 2009. Tiscali's former carrier company, Tiscali International Network, was a pure-play carrier business delivering wholesale services including Global IP Connectivity, MPLS lines, Voice over IP and Network Monitoring. In May 2009, its IP/MPLS backbone counted 90 Points of Presence and extended over 17 European countries and across the United States and Hong Kong.

Career Cumberland served on the China Station with the 5th Cruiser Squadron from 1928 until 1938, returning to the UK in March 1935 for a refit. In 1938, she joined the 2nd cruiser squadron on the South American station.

South African service After this, she sailed to Simonstown, South Africa, spending between January and February undergoing a refit. She then escorted convoys along the African coast, bound for the Middle East. In July, she was tasked, along with her sister, , with hunting down the German commerce raider (known as Raider E to the Royal Navy). Whilst on patrol, she intercepted the Vichy French merchant Poitiers, which had been carrying ammunition to the Ivory Coast. Rather than see their ship fall into enemy hands, the crew promptly opened its seacocks and set fire to its cargo. Later that month, she attacked Dakar, suffering damage from a French coastal battery. In December, Cumberland was again hunting for the merchant raider Thor, but the search proved unsuccessful. Arctic convoys In October 1941, Cumberland joined the 1st Cruiser Squadron Home Fleet escorting the Arctic convoys until January 1944, winning the battle honour Arctic 1942-1943.

On 7 February 1945, Cumberland was back in Simonstown to have her rudder removed. Postwar She returned to the United Kingdom on 12 November 1945 and transported troops until June 1946, when she was placed in reserve until 1949. She was then refitted at Devonport (1949‚Äì1951) for further service as a gunnery trials ship. She lost her 8-inch turrets, and for a few years had a prototype dual 6-inch automatic turret (testing the concept for later installation in the then building s) in 'B' position, and a prototype automatic dual 3-inch turret (also slated for the Tigers) in 'X' position. For the 1956 film The Battle of the River Plate, Cumberland played herself, arriving with unexpected speed from the Falklands after the battle, to replace the damaged . Although she was without her 8-inch gun turrets at this time and was refitted with lattice masts, she is very recognisable as the last of the three-funnelled heavy cruisers to remain in service.

T&T; Clark 2014 TOM HARPUR p.19-20 He was the author of a number of books, including For Christ's Sake (1986), Life after Death (1996), The Pagan Christ (2004), and Born Again (2011 and 2017).\\"The Pagan Christ\\", CBC, December 6, 2007. Background and education Born in the east end of Toronto, Ontario, to an evangelical family, on April 14, 1929, Harpur earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honours in 1951 at University College at the University of Toronto, where he won the Jarvis Scholarship in Greek and Latin, the Maurice Hutton Scholarship in Classics, the Sir William Mulock Scholarship in Classics, and the Gold Medal in Classics. He went on to study literae humaniores (\\"greats\\" or classics) at Oriel College at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar from 1951 to 1954 where he read the ancient historians (Herodotus, Thucydides, and Tacitus) completely in their original texts. He graduated in 1954 with a BA degree and was conferred a Master of Arts degree two years later. Between 1954 and 1956 he studied theology at Wycliffe College, University of Toronto, where he was a tutor in Greek. At Wycliffe he won prizes in homiletics and Greek and was the senior student and valedictorian in his graduating year. He returned to Oxford in 1962 and 1963 for his postgraduate studies where he read the Church Fathers. Career=Priesthood Harpur was ordained a priest in the Anglican Church of Canada in 1956. He served as a curate at St. John's York Mills, Toronto from 1956 to 1957. From 1957 to 1964 he served the parish of St. Margaret's-in-the-Pines in Scarborough, Ontario. During this time he lectured on ancient philosophy part-time at Wycliffe College. From 1962 to 1963 he spent a further year at Oriel College, Oxford, doing postgraduate research in Patristics and New Testament studies. Academia From 1964 to 1971, Harpur was an assistant professor and then a full professor of New Testament and New Testament Greek at Wycliffe, and from 1984 to 1987 he was part-time lecturer on the Theology and Praxis of Mass Media course at the Toronto School of Theology in the University of Toronto. Journalism Harpur worked as a journalist at the Toronto Star for thirty years, twelve of which were as the newspaper's religion editor. He met his wife Susan at the Star, where she worked in the legal department, and married her in 1980. After leaving the position of religion editor in 1984 he continued to contribute a regular column on religious and ethical issues. Harpur also wrote a number of books on religion and theology, ten of which became Canadian bestsellers and two of which were made into TV series for VisionTV. For a time he had his own radio show, Harpur's Heaven and Hell, and has hosted a variety of radio and television programs on the topic of religion, particularly on VisionTV. He was, over the years, a frequent commentator on religious news events for most of the Canadian networks, especially CBC. In his later years, Harpur also wrote occasional opinion pieces Postmedia Network and a column for Sun Media.http://www.tomharpur.com/biography/ In 1996, his bestseller Life After Death about near-death experiences was turned into a ten-episode TV series hosted by Harpur himself. Harpur's 2004 book The Pagan Christ was named the Canadian non-fiction bestseller of the year by the Toronto Star and The Globe and Mail. Fellowships and awards Harpur was a Fellow of the American Religious Public Relations Council, and in 1976 won a State of Israel Silver Medal for Outstanding Journalism. His biography is included in the American Who's Who in Religion, Canadian Who's Who, and Men of Achievement. In 2008 the CBC documentary The Pagan Christ, based upon Harpur's book, won the Platinum Remi Award at the Houston International Film Festival and the Gold Camera Award at the US International Film and Video Festival in Redondo Beach, California. He belonged to the Canadian Association of Rhodes Scholars and the Writers' Union.  The Pagan Christ  Harpur's 2004 book The Pagan Christ presents the case that the gospels rework ancient pagan myths. Harpur builds on Alvin Boyd Kuhn when listing similarities among the stories of Jesus, Horus, Mithras, Buddha and others. According to Harpur, in the second or third centuries, the early church created the fictional impression of a literal and historic Jesus and then used forgery and violence to cover up the evidence. Having come to see the scriptures as symbolic allegory of a cosmic truth rather than as inconsistent history, Harpur concludes he has a greater internal connection with the spirit of Christ.Tom Harpur, The Pagan Christ (Toronto: Thomas Allen Publishers, 2004) The book received a great deal of criticism, including a response book, Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea. Robert M. Price's negative review of The Pagan Christ notes, Harpur published a more scholarly sequel called Water Into Wine in 2007. Death Harpur died in Lion's Head, Ontario, on January 2, 2017, at age 87.http://obittree.com/obituary/ca/ontario/richmond-hill/marshall-funeral- home/thomas-harpur/2813519/  Bibliography  * Harpur's Heaven and Hell.

He returned to the concerto in the summer of 1917. It premiered on October 18, 1923 at the Paris Opera with Marcel Darrieux playing the violin part and the Paris Opera Orchestra conducted by Serge Koussevitzky. Igor Stravinsky made his debut as conductor at the same concert,Steinberg, 349. conducting the first performance of his own Octet for Wind Instruments. Structure The concerto is written in three movements: #Andantino #Scherzo: Vivacissimo #Moderato ‚Äì Allegro moderato History Despite the events leading to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and eventually the October Revolution, 1917 became Prokofiev's most productive year compositionally. Along with this concerto he completed the \\"Classical\\" Symphony, the Third and Fourth Piano Sonatas, and the Visions Fugitives for piano. He also began the cantata Seven, They Are Seven, based on Chaldean texts, and worked on the Third Piano Concerto. Nevertheless, Prokofiev continued his habit of incorporating previously composed sections in the violin concerto (something he would also do in the Third Piano Concerto). He composed the concerto's opening melody in 1915, during his love affair with Nina Mescherskaya.Daniel Jaff√©, booklet note to CD recording: Sarah Chang, Berliner Philharmoniker cond. Simon Rattle (EMI 3 46053 2) The remaining movements were partly inspired by a 1916 Saint Petersburg performance of Karol Szymanowski's Myths by Polish violinist Paul Kochanski. Its premiere in Paris was a relative failure, partly due to the work being overshadowed by Stravinsky's more modish Octet.Jaff√© (1998): p. 92 The Concerto's premiere had also been delayed some seven years after it had been completed, due to Prokofiev's itinerant existence at that time and the difficulty in finding a soloist. Had the premiere taken place in Petrograd in 1917, as initially planned, Kochanski would have taken the part. By 1923, however, Kochanski was unavailable for the scheduled Paris premiere. Bronis≈Çaw Huberman would not even look at the score.Prokofiev (1991): p. 275 Nathan Milstein was still in Russia. The violinist who finally tackled the solo part was Sergei Koussevitzky's concertmaster, Marcel Darrieux; although not famous, he was a solid musician and a more than able violinist, which was all that was necessary for a performance (Darrieux also premiered Kurt Weill's Concerto for Violin and Wind Instruments in 1925.Classical ArchivesKurt Weill: A Detailed Chronology) Joseph Szigeti was in the audience, and was so impressed with the work that he took the Concerto into his repertory.Phillips (2008): 712 The following year Szigeti achieved success when he played the Concerto in Prague with Fritz Reiner as conductor, then toured it around Europe and the United States. However, the U.S. premiere was not played by Szigeti, but by Richard Burgin, the concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, on 24 April 1925, again under Koussevitzky. There were also the musical tastes of the Parisian public to consider. Audience members, especially those who came to Koussevitzky concerts, wanted modern music with a certain amount of shock value. The fact that The Rite of Spring had failed a decade earlier was relative‚Äîthe choreography had been a failure; the music was a success, as proved a few months later when it was heard enthusiastically in concert. While Paris welcomed spiked dissonant works such as the ballet Chout (The Buffoon) and the Scythian Suite, the First Violin Concerto was simply too Romantic in tone for their preferences. The composer Georges Auric even called the work \\"Mendelssohnian.\\"Steinberg, 351. The premiere of the work in the Soviet Union is also worth noting since it was given just three days after the Paris premiere by two 19-year-olds, Nathan Milstein and Vladimir Horowitz. Horowitz played the orchestral part on the piano. Milstein later wrote in his memoirs, From Russia to the West, \\"I feel that if you have a great pianist like Horowitz playing with you, you don't need an orchestra.\\"Quoted in Steinberg, 350. Milstein and Horowitz also introduced Karol Szymanowski's First Violin Concerto at the same concert.Steinberg, 350. Analysis The work opens ethereally, gains momentum and becalms; this describes both the opening movement, and the piece taken as a whole. The three movements begin in D major, E minor, and G minor respectively, and the work closes in a manner similar to that of the opening movement, seeming to climb peacefully. Apart from the solo violin, the concerto is scored for moderate-sized orchestra including two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, tuba, timpani, snare drum, tambourine, harp, and strings. First movement The first movement, marked Andantino and commencing in compound duple meter, opens with a lyrical violin melody to be played \\"sognando\\" (dreamily) and \\"pianissimo\\" (very softly) over viola tremolos. The violin is joined in dialogue by the flutes, clarinets and oboes. The second theme, more virtuosic and forceful, is marked \\"narrante\\"; David Oistrakh recalled that Prokofiev had said \\"play it as though you're trying to convince someone of something.\\" Shifts to 4/4 time and C major serve to accentuate the contrast with the principal theme. The development begins with the soloist playing pizzicato, and proceeds to develop upon the principal theme. In a brief recapitulation, the theme is restated not by the soloist but the principal flute, accompanied elaborately by the soloist and harp. Second movement The second movement, a scherzo marked Vivacissimo, is in rondo form. Michael Steinberg wrote that the movement 'represents the \\"savage\\" element' of the concerto 'as against the generally more lyrical first and third movements. The music, full of contrast, is by turns amusing, naughty, for a while even malevolent, athletic, and always violinistically ingenious and brilliant. It seems to be over in a moment.' Third movement The third and final movement, initially marked Moderato, starts with a bassoon theme over a metronomic eighth-note orchestral accompaniment. The soloist assumes the theme from the bassoon before dropping back to an accompanying role when the movement transitions to a section marked Allegro moderato. The solo violin increasingly interchanges between the roles of soloist and accompanist. The movement ends with the music fading away in tempo and dynamics. ReferencesBibliography * Jaff√©, Daniel.

There were two versions of the ballet; the original choreographed by Filippo Taglioni in 1832, and a second version choreographed by August Bournonville in 1836. Bournonville's is the only version known to have survived and is one of the world's oldest surviving ballets.  Taglioni version On 12 March 1832 the first version of La Sylphide premiered at the Salle Le Peletier of the Paris Op√©ra with choreography by the groundbreaking Italian choreographer Filippo Taglioni and music by Jean-Madeleine Schneitzhoeffer. Taglioni designed the work as a showcase for his daughter Marie. La Sylphide was the first ballet where dancing en pointe had an aesthetic rationale and was not merely an acrobatic stunt, often involving ungraceful arm movements and exertions, as had been the approach of dancers in the late 1820s. Marie was known for shortening her skirts in the performance of La Sylphide (to show off her excellent pointe work), which was considered highly scandalous at the time. The ballet's libretto was written by tenor Adolphe Nourrit, the first \\"Robert\\" in Meyerbeer's Robert Le Diable, an opera which featured Marie Taglioni in its dance section, Ballet of the Nuns. Nourrit's scenario was loosely based on a story by Charles Nodier, \\"Trilby, ou Le lutin d'Argail,\\" but swapped the genders of the protagonists ‚Äî a goblin and a fisherman's wife of Nodier; a sylph and a farmer in the ballet. The scene of Old Madge's witchcraft which opens Act II of the ballet was inspired by Niccol√≤ Paganini's Le Streghe, which in its turn was inspired by a scene of witches from Il Noce di Benevento (The Walnut Tree of Benevento), an 1812 ballet by choreographer Salvatore Vigan√≤ and composer Franz Xaver S√ºssmayr.' Emma Livry in the title role of the Taglioni/Schneitzhoeffer La Sylphide. Paris, 1862  Revivals  Emma Livry, one of the last ballerinas of the Romantic ballet era, made her debut with the Paris Opera Ballet as the sylph in an 1858 production of La Sylphide. When Marie Taglioni (who had retired in 1847) saw Livry in the role, she stayed on in Paris to teach the girl, who reminded her of herself as a young woman. In 1892, Marius Petipa mounted a revival of Taglioni's original La Sylphide for the Imperial Ballet, with additional music by Riccardo Drigo. A variation Drigo composed for the ballerina Varvara Nikitina in Petipa's version is today the traditional solo danced by the lead ballerina of the famous Paquita Grand Pas Classique. In 1972, a new version of La Sylphide, based on the Taglioni version, was choreographed and staged by Pierre Lacotte for the Paris Opera Ballet. Since Taglioni's choreography has been irretrievably lost, Lacotte's choreography is based on prints, notes, drawings, and archival materials from the era of the ballet's premiere. Lacotte's choreography is in the style of the period, but entirely new and has been criticised by some as inauthentic. Interpreters of the role of Lacotte's version at the Opera National de Paris include Ghislaine Thesmar (Lacotte's wife) and Aurelie Dupont. Both artists have recorded their work on DVD and video.  Bournonville version  August Bournonville in 1841.Terry, Walter. The King's Ballet Master: A Biography of Denmark's August Bournonville. New York: Dodd, Mead, & Company, 1979. . The Danish ballet master August Bournonville had intended to present a revival of Taglioni's original version in Copenhagen with the Royal Danish Ballet, but the Paris Opera demanded too high a price for Schneitzhoeffer's score. In the end, Bournonville mounted his own production of La Sylphide based on the original libretto, with music by Herman Severin L√∏venskiold. The premiere took place on 28 November 1836,La Sylphide, German Wikipedia entry, retrieved February 2, 2012. with the prodigy Lucile Grahn and Bournonville in the principal roles. The Bournonville version has been danced in its original form by the Royal Danish Ballet ever since its creation and remains one of Bournonville's most celebrated works. Modern interpreters of Bournonville's version include Eva Evdokimova and Lis Jeppesen, whose performance is recorded on DVD. Scenario= Act 1  In the hall of a Scottish farmhouse, James Ruben, a young Scotsman, sleeps in a chair by the fireside. A sylph gazes lovingly upon him and dances about his chair. She kisses him and then vanishes when he suddenly wakes. James rouses his friend Gurn from sleep, and questions him about the sylph. Gurn denies having seen such a creature and reminds James that he is shortly to be married. James dismisses the incident and promises to forget it. James' bride-to-be, Effie, arrives with her mother and bridesmaids. James dutifully kisses her, but is startled by a shadow in the corner. Thinking his sylph has returned, he rushes over, only to find the witch, Old Madge, kneeling at the hearth to warm herself. James is furious with disappointment. Effie and her friends beg Old Madge to tell their fortunes, and the witch complies. She gleefully informs Effie that James loves someone else and she will be united with Gurn. James is furious. He forces Madge from the hearth and throws her out of the house. Effie is delighted that James would tangle with a witch for her sake. Effie and her bridesmaids hurry upstairs to prepare for the wedding, and James is left alone in the room. As he stares out the window, the sylph materializes before him and confesses her love. She weeps at his apparent indifference. James resists at first, but, captivated by her ethereal beauty, capitulates and kisses her tenderly. Gurn, who spies the moment from the shadows, scampers off to tell Effie what has happened. When the distressed Effie and her friends enter after hearing Gurn's report, the sylph disappears. The guests assume Gurn is simply jealous and laugh at him. Everyone dances. The sylph enters during the midst of the revelry and attempts to distract James. As the bridal procession forms, James stands apart and gazes upon the ring he is to place on Effie's finger. The Sylph snatches the ring, places it on her own finger, and, smiling enticingly, rushes into the forest. James hurries after her in ardent pursuit. The guests are bewildered with James' sudden departure. Effie is heartbroken. She falls into her mother's arms sobbing inconsolably.  Act 2  In a fog-shrouded part of the forest, Madge and her companion witches dance grotesquely about a cauldron. The revellers add all sorts of filthy ingredients to the brew. When the contents glow, Madge reaches into the cauldron and pulls a diaphanous, magic scarf from its depths. The cauldron then sinks, the witches scatter, the fog lifts, and a lovely glade is revealed. James enters with the sylph, who shows him her charming woodland realm. She brings him berries and water for refreshment but avoids his embrace. To cheer him, she summons her ethereal sisters who shyly enter and perform their airy dances. The young Scotsman is delighted and joins the divertissement before all flee for another part of the forest. Meanwhile, the wedding guests have been searching the woodland for James. They enter the glade. Gurn finds his hat, but Madge convinces him to say nothing. Effie enters, weary with wandering about the forest. Madge urges Gurn to propose. He does and Effie accepts his proposal. When they all have left, James enters the glade. Madge meets him, and tosses him the magic scarf. She tells the young farmer the scarf will bind the sylph to him so she cannot fly away. She instructs him to wind the scarf about the sylph's shoulders and arms for full effect. James is ecstatic. When the sylph returns and sees the scarf, she allows James to place it around her trembling form. As James embraces the sylph passionately, her wings fall off, she shudders, and dies in James' arms. Sorrowfully, her sisters enter and lift her lifeless form. Suddenly, a joyful wedding procession led by Effie and Gurn crosses the glade. James is stunned. James directs his gaze heavenward; he sees the sylph borne aloft by her sisters. James collapses. Madge exults over his lifeless body. She has triumphed.

S. Gilbert in the 1882 Savoy opera, Iolanthe.Oxford Music Online, The Mountain Sylph La Sylphide is often confused with the 1909 ballet Les Sylphides, another ballet involving a mythical sylph. The latter was choreographed by Michel Fokine for the Ballets Russes, using music by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, as a short performance. Though inspired by La Sylphide, it was meant to be performed as an independent ballet with its own merits. Matthew Bourne created an updated version of La Sylphide in his 1994 production, Highland Fling. This is set in contemporary Scotland (of the 1990s) and uses the original score by Herman Severin L√∏venskiold.

An individual might also set a higher reservation wage when considering an offer of an unpleasant or undesirable job than when considering a type of job the individual likes (see compensating differential).

Biography Julia was born in Rome. Her parents divorced when Julia was an infant, due to her mother's family's connections to the opponents of Emperor Nero. In 65, after the failure of the Pisonian conspiracy, the family of Marcia Furnilla was disfavored by Nero. Julia's father, Titus concluded that he did not want to be connected with any potential plotters and ended his marriage to Marcia Furnilla. Julia was raised by her father. Titus conquered Jerusalem on Julia's sixth birthday. When growing up, Titus offered her in marriage to his brother Domitian, but he refused because of his infatuation with Domitia Longina. Later she married her second paternal cousin Titus Flavius Sabinus, brother to consul Titus Flavius Clemens, who married her first cousin Flavia Domitilla. By then Domitian had seduced her. When her father and husband died, in the words of Dio, Domitian: :\\"lived with [her] as husband with wife, making little effort at concealment. Then upon the demands of the people he became reconciled with Domitia, but continued his relations with Julia nonetheless.\\"Cassius Dio, 67.3 Juvenal condemns this liaison as follows: :\\"Such a man was that adulterer [i.e. Domitian] who, after lately defiling himself by a union of the tragic style, revived the stern laws that were to be a terror to all men ‚Äì ay, even to Mars and Venus ‚Äì just as Julia was relieving her fertile womb and giving birth to abortions that displayed the likeness of her uncle.\\"Juvenal, Satires ii.32.

His father was William de Irvine of Wodehouse, Laird of Bonshaw Castle. Armour bearer William was the armour bearer and aide to Robert the Bruce. The Irvines had been close allies of the Bruce during his wars with England. During one such time the Bruce made flight with a few aides, riding hard and exhaustingly. At one point they had to rest and the Bruce took sleep under a holly tree while William Irvine kept guard. From this story grows the Irvines of Drum Castle's coat of arms with the holly. At the Battle of Bannockburn (where the Scots won) in June 1314 William fought alongside the Bruce. Recognition Drum Castle awarded to William Irvine for faithful service For his services to the Bruce, William Irvine was granted land north of Aberdeen in 1323. He was given of John Comyn land, which included the Royal Forest of Oaks and Drum Castle, thus William became the first Laird of Drum. The Irvines would retain the land for over 650 years until it was handed over to the National Trust for Scotland. William was Keeper of the Rolls for Scotland from 1328 to 1331. He last appears in the record in a charter of King David II of Scotland of 1332 granting him the lands of Whiterigg and Redmyres.

The concept originates in Robin Hanson's argument that the failure to find any extraterrestrial civilizations in the observable universe implies the possibility something is wrong with one or more of the arguments from various scientific disciplines that the appearance of advanced intelligent life is probable; this observation is conceptualized in terms of a \\"Great Filter\\" which acts to reduce the great number of sites where intelligent life might arise to the tiny number of intelligent species with advanced civilizations actually observed (currently just one: human).Hanson 1998: \\"No alien civilizations have substantially colonized our solar system or systems nearby. Thus among the billion trillion stars in our past universe, none has reached the level of technology and growth that we may soon reach. This one data point implies that a Great Filter stands between ordinary dead matter and advanced exploding lasting life. And the big question is: How far along this filter are we?\\" This probability threshold, which could lie behind us (in our past) or in front of us (in our future), might work as a barrier to the evolution of intelligent life, or as a high probability of self-destruction. The main counter-intuitive conclusion of this observation is that the easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the bleaker our future chances probably are. The idea was first proposed in an online essay titled \\"The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past It?\\", written by economist Robin Hanson. The first version was written in August 1996 and the article . Since that time, Hanson's formulation has received recognition in several published sources discussing the Fermi paradox and its implications.  Main argument =Fermi paradox There is no reliable evidence aliens have visited Earth and we have observed no intelligent extraterrestrial life with current technology nor has SETI found any transmissions from other civilizations. The Universe, apart from the Earth, seems \\"dead\\"; Hanson states: > Our planet and solar system, however, don't look substantially colonized by > advanced competitive life from the stars, and neither does anything else we > see. To the contrary, we have had great success at explaining the behavior > of our planet and solar system, nearby stars, our galaxy, and even other > galaxies, via simple \\"dead\\" physical processes, rather than the complex > purposeful processes of advanced life. Life is expected to expand to fill all available niches.\\"Are We All Alone, or could They be in the Asteroid Belt\\" by Michael D. Papagiannis, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 19, p.277 With technology such as self-replicating spacecraft, these niches would include neighboring star systems and even, on longer time scales which are still small compared to the age of the universe, other galaxies. Hanson notes, \\"If such advanced life had substantially colonized our planet, we would know it by now.\\" The Great Filter With no evidence of intelligent life other than ourselves, it appears that the process of starting with a star and ending with \\"advanced explosive lasting life\\" must be unlikely. This implies that at least one step in this process must be improbable. Hanson's list, while incomplete, describes the following nine steps in an \\"evolutionary path\\" that results in the colonization of the observable universe: # The right star system (including organics and potentially habitable planets) # Reproductive molecules (e.g. RNA) # Simple (prokaryotic) single-cell life # Complex (eukaryotic) single- cell life # Sexual reproduction # Multi-cell life # Tool-using animals with intelligence # A civilization advancing toward the potential for a colonization explosion (where we are now) # Colonization explosion According to the Great Filter hypothesis, at least one of these steps‚Äîif the list were complete‚Äîmust be improbable. If it is not an early step (i.e., in our past), then the implication is that the improbable step lies in our future and our prospects of reaching step 9 (interstellar colonization) are still bleak. If the past steps are likely, then many civilizations would have developed to the current level of the human species. However, none appear to have made it to step 9, or the Milky Way would be full of colonies. So perhaps step 9 is the unlikely one, and the only things that appear likely to keep us from step 9 are some sort of catastrophe, an underestimation of the impact of procrastination as technology increasingly unburdens existence or resource exhaustion leading to the impossibility of making the step due to consumption of the available resources (for example highly constrained energy resources). So by this argument, finding multicellular life on Mars (provided it evolved independently) would be bad news, since it would imply steps 2‚Äì6 are easy, and hence only 1, 7, 8 or 9 (or some unknown step) could be the big problem. Although steps 1‚Äì8 have occurred on Earth, any one of these may be unlikely. If the first seven steps are necessary preconditions to calculating the likelihood (using the local environment) then an anthropically biased observer can infer nothing about the general probabilities from its (pre-determined) surroundings. In a 2020 paper, Jacob Haqq-Misra, Ravi Kumar Kopparapu, and Edward Schwieterman argued that current and future telescopes searching for biosignatures in the ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths could place upper bounds on the fraction of planets in the galaxy that host life. Meanwhile, the evolution of telescopes that can detect technosignatures at mid-infrared wavelengths could provide insights into the Great Filter. They say that if planets with technosignatures are abundant, then we can increase our confidence that the Great Filter is in the past. On the other hand, if we find that life is commonplace while technosignatures are absent, then this would increase the likelihood that the Great Filter lies in the future. Responses There are many alternative scenarios that might allow for the evolution of intelligent life to occur multiple times without either catastrophic self-destruction or glaringly visible evidence. These are possible resolutions to the Fermi paradox: \\"They do exist, but we see no evidence\\". Other ideas include: it is too expensive to spread physically throughout the galaxy; Earth is purposefully isolated; it is dangerous to communicate and hence civilizations actively hide, among others. Astrobiologists Dirk Schulze-Makuch and William Bains, reviewing the history of life on Earth, including convergent evolution, concluded that transitions such as oxygenic photosynthesis, the eukaryotic cell, multicellularity, and tool-using intelligence are likely to occur on any Earth-like planet given enough time. They argue that the Great Filter may be abiogenesis, the rise of technological human-level intelligence, or an inability to settle other worlds because of self-destruction or a lack of resources. Astronomer Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute argues that one can postulate a galaxy filled with intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that have failed to colonize the Earth. Perhaps the aliens lacked the intent and purpose to colonize or depleted their resources, or maybe the galaxy is colonized but in a heterogeneous manner, or the Earth could be located in a \\"galactic backwater\\". Although absence of evidence generally is only weak evidence of absence, the absence of extraterrestrial megascale engineering projects, for example, might point to the Great Filter at work. Does this mean that one of the steps leading to intelligent life is unlikely? According to Shostak: > This is, of course, a variant on the Fermi paradox: We don't see clues to > widespread, large-scale engineering, and consequently we must conclude that > we're alone. But the possibly flawed assumption here is when we say that > highly visible construction projects are an inevitable outcome of > intelligence. It could be that it's the engineering of the small, rather > than the large, that is inevitable. This follows from the laws of inertia > (smaller machines are faster, and require less energy to function) as well > as the speed of light (small computers have faster internal communication). > It may be‚Äîand this is, of course, speculation‚Äîthat advanced societies are > building small technology and have little incentive or need to rearrange the > stars in their neighborhoods, for instance.

In 2017 the club was bought by Unicusano, thus adding the name of the private university to the club. The word \\"Unicusano\\" was also added to the crest in 2017‚Äì18 season, but was removed in May 2018. The club was founded in 1925 and refounded in 1993. In its history, Ternana have twice played in Serie A (seasons 1972‚Äì73 and 1974‚Äì75) and 27 times in Serie B. The club is currently playing in Serie C. The first team from Umbria to reach Serie A, Ternana enjoy a local rivalry with Perugia, and play their home matches at the Stadio Libero Liberati. History=Serie AFoundation The club was founded in 1925 as Terni F.B.C after the merger between Terni Football Club and Unione Sportiva Ternana, reaching the II Division in 1926 and the I Division (nowadays known as Serie B) just a year later. From Serie C to Serie B The club, however, folded in due to financial difficulties, being refounded in 1929 as Unione Fascista Ternana (a denomination that was common during the Italian fascist regime). Folding again in 1933, the club returned to footballing action in 1935 under the name Polisportiva Mario Umberto Borzacchini, after a racing car driver and a native of Terni who had died at the 1933 Monza Grand Prix. In 1938 the new club reached promotion to Serie C, missing a second consecutive promotion the following year. In 1946, after the World War II, football restarted in Italy and Ternana played in the Serie B, missing promotion for two consecutive years, and being relegated to Serie C in 1949 and IV Serie in 1950. A third relegation, this time to Promozione, came in 1953, and was followed by two years in the regional division for Ternana before returning to IV Serie in 1955. The club returned to Serie C in 1964, and Serie B in 1968, the latter under coach Corrado Viciani. 1970s‚Äì1993: From Serie A to bankruptcy 1972‚Äì73 Ternana, at its first Serie A season. In 1972, Ternana finally won Serie B and reached Serie A for their first time, again with Viciani as coach. However, the club did not prove to be ready for Serie A, as they were promptly relegated in their debut appearance in the top flight, managing only three wins in 30 matches. In 1974, again in Serie B, Ternana managed to reach one of the three top spots, winning their second promotion to Serie A; this was, however, followed by yet another sad relegation. In the following years, despite a number of noted head coaches such as Edmondo Fabbri, Cesare Maldini and Renzo Ulivieri, Ternana did not manage to return in the top flight, and instead were relegated to Serie C in 1980, despite a prestigious run in the 1979‚Äì80 Coppa Italia, where Ternana reached the semi-finals, being then eliminated 3‚Äì1 on aggregate by Roma. During the 1980s Ternana played between Serie C1 and Serie C2, before going bankrupt on 12 December 1987. Managed by an official liquidator, Ternana ended the season and escaped relegation. The club, bought in the summer of 1988 by a consortium headed by Gaspare Gambino, won promotion to Serie C in 1988‚Äì89 after winning the penalty shootout in a playoff against Chieti. Successively, Ternana won Serie C1 in 1992 and marked their return to Serie B. The promotion was, however, followed by financial troubles that prevented new signings. At the end of the season, which the team finished in the last position, Ternana went officially bankrupt. 1993‚Äì1998: From the refoundation to Serie B On the summer 1993 the club was refounded as Ternana Calcio and was being forced to begin again from Serie D. In their first Serie D campaign, Ternana missed promotion, ending in third place behind Teramo and local rivals Narnese. This was followed by another unsuccessful attempt, as Ternana lost promotion to Viterbese; despite this, the club was later readmitted to Serie C2 to fill a league vacancy (ripescaggio). In 1996‚Äì97 and 1997‚Äì98, with a new president and Luigi Delneri as head coach, Ternana won two consecutive promotions, thus returning to Serie B. 1998‚Äìpresent: From Serie B to Lega Pro Prima Divisione and back Ternana played Serie B from 1998 until 2006. In 2004 missed a promotion in Serie A finishing 4 points behind Fiorentina. In 2006 they were relegated to Serie C1 (since the season 2008‚Äì09 Lega Pro Prima Divisione). In the season 2010‚Äì11 the club was relegated to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione after losing the play-out, but it was later readmitted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione on 4 August 2011 to fill vacancies.http://sport.repubblica.it/news/sport/calcio-lega-pro- ripescaggi-5-in-i-divisione-e-rimini-in-ii/4014274 In the following season 2011‚Äì12 it was promoted from Lega Pro Prima Divisione to Serie B. Back in Serie B, Ternana has avoided relegation as well as play-outs for 6 consecutive seasons. In June 2017, the ownership of the club passed to the Stefano Bandecchi (owner of the Universit√† degli Studi Niccol√≤ Cusano).

Early life Born in Princess Anne County, Virginia to Anthony Walke and Susan Hatfield Carmichael Walke, and named Henry Augustus Walke, he chose not to use his middle name or initial. He was appointed a midshipman on February 1, 1827, and reported for duty at the Gosport Navy Yard, Virginia. He received his initial naval training at Gosport and, from July 1827 to November 1828, cruised the Caribbean in sloop in the campaign against pirates in that area. He made a voyage to the Mediterranean Sea on between August 1829 and November 1831. Walke received his warrant as a passed midshipman on July 12, 1833, and, after several months of post-sea duty leave, transferred to duty ashore at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on March 7, 1834. Between January 1836 and June 1839, he cruised the Pacific Squadron in the 74-gun ship of the line , primarily along the western coast of South America protecting American commerce during a period of unrest caused by strained relations between the United States and Mexico and the war between Peru and Chile.Rear Admiral, USN (1809-1896), Naval History and Heritage Command During service in the receiving ship at New York, Walke was promoted to lieutenant before reporting on board on October 5, 1840. While Walke was assigned to that sloop of war, she made a cruise to the East Indies. Returning home in 1843, he went ashore for an extended leave before returning to sea in the brig in May 1844 for a cruise along the Brazilian coast. He returned home early in 1846 and, after a year assigned to the receiving ship at New York, made an eight-month voyage in during which his ship participated in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, blockading Laguna and supporting landings at Tuxpan and Tabasco. In October 1847, Lt. Walke went home for another extended leave after which he reported back to the receiving ship at New York on September 22, 1848. On June 23, 1849, he returned to sea in for a cruise to the Mediterranean Sea which lasted until mid-January 1851. Following a post-voyage leave, he reported to the Naval Observatory on April 22 for a brief tour before beginning further duty in the receiving ship at New York Harbor. That tour lasted three years, from July 17, 1851 to July 17, 1854, but consisted of two distinct periods separated by a short tour of duty in during September 1853. Civil War In January 1861, as the Civil War approached, Walke was in command of at Pensacola, Florida. On the 12th, Captain James Armstrong surrendered the navy yard to Confederate forces from Alabama and Florida. After providing temporary support for the defenders of Fort Pickens, who refused to follow Armstrong's example, Walke took off some of the loyal sailors and navy yard employees and got underway for New York on the 16th. After arriving at New York on February 4, the commander and his ship loaded supplies and reinforcements for Fort Pickens. Evening Post, March 29, 1861 Supply set sail on March 15 and anchored near the fort on April 7 and landed the troops and supplies without Walke. It turned out that the Navy Secretary Isaac Toucey wanted the USS Supply to sail for Vera Cruz, Mexico with provisions, instead of delivering loyal to the Union cause personnel and their families to New York. In a subsequent court- martial Walke was cleared of several charges but admonished for disobeying his orders to rejoin the squadron of Garrett J. Pendergrast at Vera Cruz.The Naval General Court-Martial; TRIAL OF COMMANDER WALKE, The New York Times, February 27, 1861, p. 8. Operations supporting the nascent Union blockade preoccupied the Navy, and Walke received orders to take command of one of the Navy's newly acquired steamers. Following that service--during the summer of 1861--and a four-day tour as lighthouse inspector for the 11th District early in September, Walke headed west in response to orders to special duty at St. Louis, Missouri. That assignment proved to be the command of , one of the river gunboats of the Army's Western Flotilla. In September and October, he took his gunboat downriver to bombard Confederate shore batteries at Hickman and Columbus in western Kentucky, and traded a few shots with the Confederate gunboat . Early in November, his ship supported Ulysses S. Grant's move on the Southern camp at Belmont, Missouri, escorting troop transports, bombarding shore batteries and, finally, covering the withdrawal of Grant's forces from the Battle of Belmont. In mid-January 1862, Commander Walke assumed command of the ironclad warship , also assigned to the Western Flotilla. In February 1862, during his tenure as Carondelet's commanding officer, Walke led her during the captures of Forts Henry and Donelson which guarded the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, respectively. In April, he led her in the passing of heavily fortified Island Number Ten and in the attack on and spiking of shore batteries below New Madrid, Missouri, in Battle of Island Number Ten. From April through the end of June, his ship participated in the drawn-out series of operations against Plum Point Bend, Fort Pillow, and Memphis. On July 15, Commander Walke almost met his match when the Confederate ironclad ram made its move down the falling Yazoo River toward Vicksburg. Carondelet supported by and Walke's former command, Tyler, engaged the Southern ironclad. During the brisk opening exchange, Carondelet suffered heavy damage and was forced out of action in a disabled, though floating, condition. Queen of the West retreated immediately, leaving only little Tyler to face the powerful ram. The Southern warship, consequently, made it safely to the stronghold at Vicksburg. On August 4, 1862, Walke was promoted to captain and assumed command of the ironclad ram then under conversion from a river steamer at St. Louis. He put her in commission on February 27, 1863, and commanded her during the dash past Vicksburg on April 6 and during the duel with shore batteries at Grand Gulf on the 29th. That summer, his ship briefly blockaded the mouth of the Red River early in June. On July 24, Captain Walke was ordered back to the East Coast to prepare the sidewheeler for service. He put her in commission on August 18, 1863 at New York, but his command of that steamer proved brief. On September 22, he was transferred to the screw sloop , which he commanded through the final two years of the Civil War, cruising the South American coast in search of Confederate commerce raiders. On August 17, 1865, he was detached from Sacramento and returned home to await orders. Post-war years Obituary from The Times (Philadelphia). On July 31, 1866, Walke was promoted to commodore. From May 1, 1868 until April 30, 1870, he commanded the naval station at Mound City, Illinois. While waiting orders to his next assignment, Walke was promoted to rear admiral on July 20, 1870. He was placed on the retired list on April 26, 1871. However, his service to the Navy did not end, for, on that same day, he reported for some variety of special duty under the senior admiral of the Navy, Admiral David Dixon Porter. That tour lasted until October 1, at which time he was appointed to the United States Lighthouse Board. Detached on April 1, 1873, he retired to a life of writing and sketching until his death in Brooklyn, New York. He was interned in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York. He was a companion of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Some called themselves Nac-nanuk or Nac-poruk, meaning \\"sons of the soil\\". The last Aimor√© group to retain their language are the Krenak. The other peoples called Botocudo were the Xokleng and Xeta. The Brazilian chief who was presented to King Henry VIII in 1532 wore small bones hung from his cheeks and from the lower lip a semi-precious stone the size of a pea. These were the marks of great bravery. When the Portuguese adventurer Vasco Fernando Coutinho reached the east coast of Brazil in 1535, he erected a fort at the head of Esp√≠rito Santo Bay to defend himself against the Aimor√©s and other tribes. Distribution and fate Botocudos by Debret The tribe's original territory was in Esp√≠rito Santo, and reached inland to the headwaters of the Rio Grande (Belmonte) and Doce River on the eastern slopes of the Espinha√ßo Mountains. The Botocudos were gradually expelled by European colonists westward beyond the Serra dos Aimor√©s into Minas Gerais. It was in the latter district that at the close of the 18th century they came into collision with the Europeans, who were attracted there by the diamond fields. At the end of the 19th century many Botocudo tribes still existed, numbering between 13,000 and 14,000 individuals. During the earlier frontier wars of 1790-1820, every effort was made to destroy them. Smallpox was deliberately spread among them; poisoned food was scattered in the forests; by such infamous means, the coast districts about Rio Doce and Belmonte were cleared, and one Portuguese commander boasted that he had either slain with his own hands or ordered to be butchered many hundreds of them. Paul Ehrenreich estimated their population at 5,000 in 1884. As of April 1939, only 68 Botocudo were alive in Eastern Brazil. They were divided into two groups. The first group numbered 10 people (belonging to Naknyanuk, Arana and Poyica tribes) and lived near Itambacuri. The second group were divided into two bands residing at Guido Marliere, on the Doce River. One band consisted of 8 survivors from the Naktun, Nakpie, Convugn and Miy√£-Yir√∫gn tribes. Another band consisted of around 50 Nakrehe. Today, only a few tribes remain, almost all of them in rural villages and the indigenous territory. The last remnants of the Eastern Botocudo are the Krenak. In 2010, there were 350 Krenak living in the state of Minas Gerais. Subdivisions Botocuden hunters (1928) The Aimor√© consisted of dozens of tribes, who spoke either dialects or closely related languages. Some of the important tribes are: * Praj√© or Prag√© - Pernambuco * Takruk-krak or Takrukrak * Crecmum or Krekm√∫n - Bahia * Etw√©t or Itu√™to - Minas Gerais * Futi-krak * Ger√©n or Gueren - Bahia * Gut-Craque or Gutucrac - Minas Gerais * Mekmek - Minas Gerais * Miny√£ Yir√∫gn or Minhagirun * Minhagiran - Esp√≠rito Santo * Nakreh√™ or Naque Ereh√™ / Nacrehe - Minas Gerais & Espirito Santo * Naque-namu * Naque-Nhepe * Naknianuk or Naknyan√∫k / Nacnhanuc - Minas Gerais Customs Botocudo man, drawn by Johann Moritz Rugendas Botocuden girls (1928) The Botocudos were nomadic hunter-gatherers, wandering naked in the woods and living from the forest. Their implements and domestic utensils were all of wood; their only weapons were reed spears and bows and arrows. Their dwellings were rough shelters of leaf and bast, seldom high. Their only musical instrument was a small bamboo nose flute. They attributed all the blessings of life to the day- fire (Sun) and all evil to night-fire (Moon). At the graves of the dead, they kept fires burning for some days to scare away evil spirits, and, during storms and eclipses, arrows were shot into the sky to drive away demons. The most conspicuous feature of the Botocudos was the tembeitera, a wooden plug or disk which is worn in the lower lip and the lobe of the ear. This disk, made of the specially light and carefully dried wood of the barriguda tree (Chorisia ventricosa), which was called by the natives themselves embur, whence Augustin Saint-Hilaire suggested that this could be the probable derivation of their name Aimbor√© (1830). It is worn only in the under-lip, now chiefly by women, but formerly by men also. The operation for preparing the lip begins often as early as the eighth year, when an initial boring is made by a hard pointed stick, and gradually extended by the insertion of larger and larger disks or plugs, sometimes at last as much as 10 cm in diameter. Notwithstanding the lightness of the wood the tembeitera weighs down the lip, which at first sticks out horizontally and at last becomes a mere ring of skin around the wood. Ear-plugs are also worn, of such size as to distend the lobe down to the shoulders. Ear-ornaments of like nature are common in south and even Central America, at least as far north as Honduras, as described by Christopher Columbus when he discovered this latter country during his fourth voyage (1502). This ornament also named part of the Peru seaboard as Costa de la Oreja, from the conspicuously distended ears of the native Chim√∫. Early Spanish explorers also gave the name Orejones or big-eared to several Amazon tribes. See also *Indigenous peoples in Brazil *History of Brazil *Luzia NotesSources *P. M. A.

In practice, land-use models are demand-driven, using as inputs the aggregate information on growth produced by an aggregate economic forecasting activity. Land-use estimates are inputs to the transportation planning process. The discussion of land-use forecasting to follow begins with a review of the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) effort. CATS researchers did interesting work, but did not produce a transferable forecasting model, and researchers elsewhere worked to develop models. After reviewing the CATS work, the discussion will turn to the first model to be widely known and emulated: the Lowry model developed by Ira S. Lowry when he was working for the Pittsburgh Regional Economic Study. Second and third generation Lowry models are now available and widely used, as well as interesting features incorporated in models that are not widely used. Today, the transportation planning activities attached to metropolitan planning organizations are the loci for the care and feeding of regional land- use models. In the US, interest in and use of models is growing rapidly, after an extended period of limited use. Interest is also substantial in Europe and elsewhere. Even though the majority of metropolitan planning agencies in the US do not use formal land-use models, we need to understand the subject: the concepts and analytic tools shape how land-use/transportation matters are thought about and handled; there is a good bit of interest in the research community where there have been important developments; and a new generation of land-use models such as LEAM and UrbanSim has developed since the 1990s that depart from these aggregate models, and incorporate innovations in discrete choice modeling, microsimulation, dynamics, and geographic information systems.  Land-use analysis at the Chicago Area Transportation Study  In brief, the CATS analysis of the 1950s was ‚Äúby mind and hand‚Äù distribute growth. The product was maps developed with a rule-based process. The rules by which land use was allocated were based on state-of-the art knowledge and concepts, and it hard to fault CATS on those grounds. The CATS took advantage of Colin Clark‚Äôs extensive work on the distribution of population densities around city centers. Theories of city form were available, sector and concentric circle concepts, in particular. Urban ecology notions were important at the University of Chicago and University of Michigan. Sociologists and demographers at the University of Chicago had begun its series of neighborhood surveys with an ecological flavor. Douglas Carroll, the CATS director, had studied with Amos Hawley, an urban ecologist at Michigan. Stylized Urban Density Gradient Colin Clark studied the population densities of many cities, and he found traces similar to those in the figure. Historic data show how the density line has changed over the years. To project the future, one uses changes in the parameters as a function of time to project the shape of density in the future, say in 20 years. The city spreads glacier-like. The area under the curve is given by population forecasts. The CATS did extensive land use and activity surveys, taking advantage of the City work done by the Chicago Planning Commission. Hock‚Äôs work forecasting activities said what the land uses‚Äîactivities were that would be accommodated under the density curve. Existing land-use data were arrayed in cross section. Land uses were allocated in a manner consistent with the existing pattern. The study area was divided into transportation analysis zones: small zones where there was a lot of activity, larger zones elsewhere. The original CATS scheme reflected its Illinois State connections. Zones extended well away from the city. The zones were defined to take advantage of Census data at the block and minor civil division levels. They also strived for homogeneous land use and urban ecology attributes. The first land use forecasts at CATS arrayed developments using ‚Äúby hand‚Äù techniques, as stated. We do not fault the ‚Äúby hand‚Äù technique ‚Äì the then state of computers and data systems forced it. It was a rule based land use allocation. Growth was the forcing function, as were inputs from the economic study. Growth said that the population density envelope would have to shift. The land uses implied by the mix of activities were allocated from ‚ÄúWhere is the land available?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the use now?‚Äù Considerations. Certain types of activities allocate easily: steel mills, warehouses, etc. Conceptually, the allocation rules seem important. There is lot of spatial autocorrelation in urban land uses; it's driven by historical path dependence: this sort of thing got started here and seeds more of the same. This autocorrelation was lost somewhat in the step from ‚Äúby hand‚Äù to analytic models. The CATS procedure was not viewed with favor by the emerging Urban Transportation Planning professional peer group, and in the late 1950s there was interest in the development of analytic forecasting procedures. At about the same time, similar interests emerged to meet urban redevelopment and sewer planning needs, and interest in analytic urban analysis emerged in political science, economics, and geography.  Lowry model  Flowchart of Lowry model Hard on the heels of the CATS work, several agencies and investigators began to explore analytic forecasting techniques, and between 1956 and the early 1960s a number of modeling techniques evolved. Irwin (1965) provides a review of the status of emerging models. One of the models, the Lowry model, was widely adopted. Supported at first by local organizations and later by a Ford Foundation grant to the RAND Corporation, Ira S. Lowry undertook a three-year study in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. (Work at RAND will be discussed later.) The environment was data rich, and there were good professional relationships available in the emerging emphasis on location and regional economies in the Economics Department at the University of Pittsburgh under the leadership of Edgar M. Hoover. The structure of the Lowry model is shown on the flow chart. The flow chart gives the logic of the Lowry model. It is demand driven. First, the model responds to an increase in basic employment. It then responds to the consequent impacts on service activities. As Lowry treated his model and as the flow chart indicates, the model is solved by iteration. But the structure of the model is such that iteration is not necessary. Although the language giving justification for the model specification is an economic language and Lowry is an economist, the model is not an economic model. Prices, markets, and the like do not enter. A review of Lowry's publication will suggest reasons why his approach has been widely adopted. The publication was the first full elaboration of a model, data analysis and handling problems, and computations. Lowry's writing is excellent. He is candid and discusses his reasoning in a clear fashion. One can imagine an analyst elsewhere reading Lowry and thinking, ‚ÄúYes, I can do that.‚Äù The diffusion of innovations of the model is interesting. Lowry was not involved in consulting, and his word of mouth contacts with transportation professionals were quite limited. His interest was and is in housing economics. Lowry did little or no ‚Äúselling.‚Äù We learn that people will pay attention to good writing and an idea whose time has come. The model makes extensive use of gravity or interaction decaying with distance functions. Use of ‚Äúgravity model‚Äù ideas was common at the time Lowry developed his model; indeed, the idea of the gravity model was at least 100 years old at the time. It was under much refinement at the time of Lowry's work; persons such as Alan Voorhees, Mort Schneider, John Hamburg, Roger Creighon, and Walter Hansen made important contributions. (See Carrothers 1956). The Lowry model provided a point of departure for work in a number of places. Goldner (1971) traces its impact and modifications made. Steven Putnam at the University of Pennsylvania used it to develop PLUM (projective land use model) and I(incremental)PLUM. We estimate that Lowry derivatives are used in most MPO studies, but most of today's workers do not recognize the Lowry heritage, the derivatives are one or two steps away from the mother logic.  Penn-Jersey model  Flowchart of Penn-Jersey land-use forecasting model The P-J (Penn-Jersey, greater Philadelphia area) analysis had little impact on planning practice. However, it illustrates what planners might have done, given available knowledge building blocks. It is an introduction to some of the work by researchers who are not practicing planners. The P-J study scoped widely for concepts and techniques. It scoped well beyond the CATS and Lowry efforts, especially taking advantage of things that had come along in the late 1950s. It was well funded and viewed by the State and the Bureau of Public Roads as a research and a practical planning effort. Its director's background was in public administration, and leading personnel were associated with the urban planning department at the University of Pennsylvania. The P-J study was planning and policy oriented. The P-J study drew on several factors \\"in the air\\". First, there was a lot of excitement about economic activity analysis and the applied math that it used, at first, linear programming. T. J. Koopmans, the developer of activity analysis, had worked in transportation. There was pull for transportation (and communications) applications, and the tools and interested professionals were available. There was work on flows on networks, through nodes, and activity location. Orden (1956) had suggested the use of conservation equations when networks involved intermediate modes; flows from raw material sources through manufacturing plants to market were treated by Beckmann and Marschak (1955) and Goldman (1958) had treated commodity flows and the management of empty vehicles. Maximal flow and synthesis problems were also treated (Boldreff 1955, Gomory and Hu 1962, Ford and Fulkerson 1956, Kalaba and Juncosa 1956, Pollack 1964). Balinski (1960) considered the problem of fixed cost. Finally, Cooper (1963) considered the problem of optimal location of nodes. The problem of investment in link capacity was treated by Garrison and Marble (1958) and the issue of the relationship between the length of the planning time-unit and investment decisions was raised by Quandt (1960) and Pearman (1974). A second set of building blocks was evolving in location economics, regional science, and geography. Edgar Dunn (1954) undertook an extension of the classic von Th√ºnen analysis of the location of rural land uses. Also, there had been a good bit of work in Europe on the interrelations of economic activity and transportation, especially during the railroad deployment era, by German and Scandinavian economists. That work was synthesized and augmented in the 1930s by August L√∂sch, and his The Location of Economic Activities was translated into English during the late 1940s. Edgar Hoover's work with the same title was also published in the late 1940s. Dunn's analysis was mainly graphical; static equilibrium was claimed by counting equations and unknowns. There was no empirical work (unlike Garrison 1958). For its time, Dunn's was a rather elegant work. William Alonso's (1964) work soon followed. It was modeled closely on Dunn's and also was a University of Pennsylvania product. Although Alonso's book was not published until 1964, its content was fairly widely known earlier, having been the subject of papers at professional meetings and Committee on Urban Economics (CUE) seminars. Alonso's work became much more widely known than Dunn's, perhaps because it focused on ‚Äúnew‚Äù urban problems. It introduced the notion of bid rent and treated the question of the amount of land consumed as a function of land rent. Wingo (1961) was also available. It was different in style and thrust from Alonso and Dunn's books and touched more on policy and planning issues. Dunn's important, but little noted, book undertook analysis of location rent, the rent referred to by Marshall as situation rent. Its key equation was: R = Y\\\\left( {P - c} \\\\right) - Ytd where: R = rent per unit of land, P = market price per unit of product, c = cost of production per unit of product, d = distance to market, and t = unit transportation cost. In addition, there were also demand and supply schedules. This formulation by Dunn is very useful, for it indicates how land rent ties to transportation cost. Alonso's urban analysis starting point was similar to Dunn's, though he gave more attention to market clearing by actors bidding for space. The question of exactly how rents tied to transportation was sharpened by those who took advantage of the duality properties of linear programming. First, there was a spatial price equilibrium perspective, as in Henderson (1957, 1958) Next, Stevens (1961) merged rent and transportation concepts in a simple, interesting paper. In addition, Stevens showed some optimality characteristics and discussed decentralized decision-making. This simple paper is worth studying for its own sake and because the model in the P-J study took the analysis into the urban area, a considerable step. Stevens 1961 paper used the linear programming version of the transportation, assignment, translocation of masses problem of Koopmans, Hitchcock, and Kantorovich. His analysis provided an explicit link between transportation and location rent. It was quite transparent, and it can be extended simply. In response to the initiation of the P-J study, Herbert and Stevens (1960) developed the core model of the P-J Study. Note that this paper was published before the 1961 paper. Even so, the 1961 paper came first in Stevens‚Äô thinking. The Herbert‚ÄìStevens model was housing centered, and the overall study had the view that the purpose of transportation investments and related policy choices was to make Philadelphia a good place to live. Similar to the 1961 Stevens paper, the model assumed that individual choices would lead to overall optimization. The P-J region was divided into u small areas recognizing n household groups and m residential bundles. Each residential bundle was defined on the house of apartment, the amenity level in the neighborhood (parks, schools, etc.), and the trip set associated with the site. There is an objective function: \\\\max Z = \\\\sum_{k = 1}^u {\\\\sum_{i = 1}^n {\\\\sum_{h = 1}^m {x_{ih}^k \\\\left( {b_{ih} - c_{ih}^k } \\\\right)} } } \\\\quad x_{ih}^k \\\\geq 0 wherein xihk is the number of households in group i selecting residential bundle h in area k. The items in brackets are bih (the budget allocated by i to bundle h) and cihk, the purchase cost of h in area k. In short, the sum of the differences between what households are willing to pay and what they have to pay is maximized; a surplus is maximized. The equation says nothing about who gets the surplus: it is divided between households and those who supply housing in some unknown way. There is a constraint equation for each area limiting the land use for housing to the land supply available. \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n {\\\\sum_{h = 1}^m {s_{ih} x_{ih}^k } } \\\\leq L^k where: sih = land used for bundle h Lk = land supply in area k And there is a constraint equation for each household group assuring that all folks can find housing. \\\\sum_{k = 1}^u {\\\\sum_{h = 1}^m {x_{ih}^k } } = N_i where: Ni = number of households in group i A policy variable is explicit, the land available in areas. Land can be made available by changing zoning and land redevelopment. Another policy variable is explicit when we write the dual of the maximization problem, namely: \\\\min Z' = \\\\sum_{k = 1}^u {r^k L^k + \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n {v_i \\\\left( { - N_i } \\\\right)} } Subject to: s_{ih} r^k - v_i \\\\geq b_{ih} - c_{ih}^k r^k \\\\geq 0 The variables are rk (rent in area k) and vi an unrestricted subsidy variable specific to each household group. Common sense says that a policy will be better for some than others, and that is reasoning behind the subsidy variable. The subsidy variable is also a policy variable because society may choose to subsidize housing budgets for some groups. The constraint equations may force such policy actions. It is apparent that the Herbert‚ÄìStevens scheme is a very interesting one. It is also apparent that it is housing centered, and the tie to transportation planning is weak. That question is answered when we examine the overall scheme for study, the flow chart of a single iteration of the model. How the scheme works requires little study. The chart doesn‚Äôt say much about transportation. Changes in the transportation system are displayed on the chart as if they are a policy matter. The word ‚Äúsimulate‚Äù appears in boxes five, eight, and nine. The P-J modelers would say, ‚ÄúWe are making choices about transportation improvements by examining the ways improvements work their way through urban development. The measure of merit is the economic surplus created in housing.‚Äù Academics paid attention to the P-J study. The Committee on Urban Economics was active at the time. The committee was funded by the Ford Foundation to assist in the development of the nascent urban economics field. It often met in Philadelphia for review of the P-J work. Stevens and Herbert were less involved as the study went along. Harris gave intellectual leadership, and he published a fair amount about the study (1961, 1962). However, the P-J influence on planning practice was nil. The study didn‚Äôt put transportation up front. There were unsolvable data problems. Much was promised but never delivered. The Lowry model was already available.  Kain model  Figure ‚Äì Causal arrow diagram illustrating Kain's econometric model for transportation demand About 1960, the Ford Foundation made a grant to the RAND Corporation to support work on urban transportation problems. (Lowry's work was supported in part by that grant) The work was housed in the logistics division of RAND, where the economists at RAND were housed. The head of that division was then Charles Zwick, who had worked on transportation topics previously. The RAND work ranged from new technology and the cost of tunneling to urban planning models and analyses with policy implications. Some of the researchers at RAND were regular employees. Most, however, were imported for short periods of time. The work was published in several formats: first in the RAND P series and RM series and then in professional publications or in book form. Often, a single piece of work is available in differing forms at different places in the literature. In spite of the diversity of topics and styles of work, one theme runs through the RAND work ‚Äì the search for economic policy guides. We see that theme in Kain (1962), which is discussed by de Neufville and Stafford, and the figure is adapted from their book. Kain's model dealt with direct and indirect effects. Suppose income increases. The increase has a direct effect on travel time and indirect effects through the use of land, auto ownership, and chopice of mode. Work supported at RAND also resulted in Meyer, Kain and Wohl (1964). These parts of the work at RAND had considerable influence on subsequent analysis (but not so much on practice as on policy). John Meyer became President of the National Bureau of Economic Research and worked to refocus its lines of work. Urban analysis Kain-style formed the core of a several-year effort and yielded book length publications (see, e.g., G. Ingram, et al., The NBER Urban Simulation Model, Columbia Univ. Press, 1972). After serving in the Air Force, Kain moved to Harvard, first to redirect the Urban Planning Department. After a time, he relocated at the Kennedy School, and he, along with Jos√© A. G√≥mez-Ib√°√±ez, John Meyer, and C. Ingram, lead much work in an economic-policy analysis style. Martin Wohl moved on from RAND, eventually, to Carnegie-Mellon University, where he continued his style of work (e.g. Wohl 1984). Policy-oriented gaming  The notion that the impact of policy on urban development might be simulated was the theme for a conference at Cornell in the early 1960s; collegiums were formed, several streams of work emerged. Several persons developed rather simple (from today's view) simulation games. Land-use development was the outcome of gravitational type forces and the issue faced was that of conflicts between developers and planners when planners intervened in growth. CLUG and METROPOLIS are two rather well known products from this stream of work (they were the SimCity of their day); there must be twenty or thirty other similar planner vs. developer in the political context games. There seems to have been little serious attempt to analyze use of these games for policy formulation and decision- making, except for work at the firm Environmetrics. Peter House, one of the Cornell Conference veterans, established environmetrics early in the 1960s. It, too, started with relatively simple gaming ideas. Over about a ten-year period, the comprehensiveness of gaming devices was gradually improved and, unlike the other gaming approaches, transportation played a role in their formulation. Environmetrics‚Äô work moved into the Environmental Protection Agency and was continued for a time at the EPA Washington Environmental Studies Center. A model known as River Basin was generalized to GEM (general environmental assessment model) and then birthed SEAS (strategic environmental assessment model) and SOS (Son of SEAS). There was quite a bit of development as the models were generalized, too much to be discussed here. The most interesting thing to be noted is change in the way the use of the models evolved. Use shifted from a ‚Äúplaying games‚Äù stance to an ‚Äúevaluate the impact of federal policy‚Äù stance. The model (both equations and data) is viewed as a generalized city or cities. It responds to the question: What would be the impact of proposed policies on cities? An example of generalized question answering is LaBelle and Moses (1983) La Belle and Moses implement the UTP process on typical cities to assess the impact of several policies. There is no mystery why this approach was used. House had moved from the EPA to the DOE, and the study was prepared for his office.  University of North Carolina  A group at Chapel Hill, mainly under the leadership of Stuart Chapin, began its work with simple analysis devices somewhat similar to those used in games. Results include Chapin (1965), Chapin and H. C. Hightower (1966) and Chapin and Weiss (1968). That group subsequently focused on (1) the ways in which individuals make tradeoffs in selecting residential property, (2) the roles of developers and developer decisions in the urban development process, and (3) information about choices obtained from survey research. Lansing and Muller (1964 and 1967) at the Survey Research Center worked in cooperation with the Chapel Hill Group in developing some of this latter information. The first work was on simple, probabilistic growth models. It quickly moved from this style to game-like interviews to investigate preferences for housing. Persons interviewed would be given ‚Äúmoney‚Äù and a set of housing attributes ‚Äì sidewalks, garage, numbers of rooms, lot size, etc. How do they spend their money? This is an early version of the game The Sims. The work also began to examine developer behavior, as mentioned. (See: Kaiser 1972).  Reviews and surveys  In addition to reviews at CUE meetings and sessions at professional meetings, there have been a number of organized efforts to review progress in land-use modeling. An early effort was the May 1965 issue of the Journal of the American Institute of Planners edited by B. Harris. The next major effort was a Highway Research Board Conference in June, 1967 (HRB 1968) and this was most constructive. This reference contains a review paper by Lowry, comments by Chapin, Alonso, and others. Of special interest is Appendix A, which listed several ways that analysis devices had been adapted for use. Robinson (1972) gives the flavor of urban redevelopment oriented modeling. And there have been critical reviews (e.g. Brewer 1973, Lee 1974). Pack (1978) addresses agency practice; it reviews four models and a number of case studies of applications. (See also Zettel and Carll 1962 and Pack and Pack 1977). The discussion above has been limited to models that most affected practice (Lowry) and theory (P-J, etc.) there are a dozen more that are noted in reviews. Several of those deal with retail and industry location. There are several that were oriented to urban redevelopment projects where transportation was not at issue.  Discussion  Lowry-derived land-use analysis tools reside in the MPOs. The MPOs also have a considerable data capability including census tapes and programs, land-use information of varied quality, and survey experiences and survey-based data. Although large model work continues, fine detail analysis dominates agency and consultant work in the US. One reason is the requirement for environmental impact statements. Energy, noise, and air pollution have been of concern, and techniques special to the analysis of these topics have been developed. Recently, interest has increased in the uses of developer fees and/or other developer transportation related actions. Perceived shortages for funds for highways and transit are one motive for extracting resources or actions from developers. There's also the long-standing ethic that those who occasion costs should pay. Finally, there is a small amount of theoretical or academic work. Small is the operative word. There are few researchers and the literature is limited. The discussion to follow will first emphasize the latter, theory-oriented work. It will then turn to a renewed interest in planning models in the international arena. Modern behavioral, academic, or theory-based analysis of transportation and land-use date from about 1965. By modern we mean analysis that derives aggregate results from micro behavior. First models were Herbert-Stevens in character. Similar to the P-J model, they: * Treated land as the constraining resource and land-use choices given land rent variations as the critical behavior. * Imagined roles for policy makers. * Emphasized residential land uses and ignored interdependencies in land uses. * Used closed system, comparative statics ways of thinking. * And gave no special attention to transportation. There have been three major developments subsequently: #. Consideration of transportation activities and labor and capital inputs in addition to land inputs, #. Efforts to use dynamic, open system ways of thinking, and #. Inquiry into how micro choice behavior yields macro results. The Herbert-Stevens model was not a behavioral model in the sense that it did not try to map from micro to macro behavior. It did assume rational, maximizing behavior by locators. But that was attached to macro behavior and policy by assumed some centralized authority that provided subsidies. Wheaton (1974) and Anderson (1982) modified the Herbert-Stevens approach in different, but fairly simple, ways to deal with the artificiality of the Herbert-Stevens formulation. An alternative to the P-J, Herbert-Stevens tradition was seeded when Edwin S. Mills, who is known as the father of modern urban economics, took on the problem of scoping more widely. Beginning with Mills (1972), Mills has developed a line of work yielding more publications and follow on work by others, especially his students. Using a Manhattan geometry, Mills incorporated a transportation component in his analysis. Homogeneous zones defined by the transportation system were analyzed as positioned x integer steps away from the central zone via the Manhattan geometry. Mills treated congestion by assigning integer measures to levels of service, and he considered the costs of increasing capacity. To organize flows, Mills assumed a single export facility in the central node. He allowed capital-land rent trade offs yielding the tallest buildings in the central zones. Stating this in a rather long but not difficult to understand linear programming format, Mills‚Äô system minimizes land, capital, labor, and congestion costs, subject to a series of constraints on the quantities affecting the system. One set of these is the exogenously gives vector of export levels. Mills (1974a,b) permitted exports from non-central zones, and other modifications shifted the ways congestion is measured and allowed for more than one mode of transport. With respect to activities, Mills introduced an input-output type coefficient for activities; aqrs, denotes land input q per unit of output r using production technique s. T.J. Kim (1979) has followed the Mills tradition through the addition of articulating sectors. The work briefly reviewed above adheres to a closed form, comparative statics manner of thinking. This note now will turn to dynamics. The literature gives rather varied statements on what consideration of dynamics means. Most often, there is the comment that time is considered in an explicit fashion, and analysis becomes dynamic when results are run out over time. In that sense, the P-J model was a dynamic model. Sometimes, dynamics are operationalized by allowing things that were assumed static to change with time. Capital gets attention. Most of the models of the type discussed previously assume that capital is malleable, and one considers dynamics if capital is taken as durable yet subject to ageing ‚Äì e.g., a building once built stays there but gets older and less effective. On the people side, intra-urban migration is considered. Sometimes too, there is an information context. Models assume perfect information and foresight. Let's relax that assumption. Anas (1978) is an example of a paper that is ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù because it considers durable capital and limited information about the future. Residents were mobile; some housing stock was durable (outlying), but central city housing stock was subject to obsolescence and abandonment. Persons working in other traditions tend to emphasize feedbacks and stability (or the lack of stability) when they think ‚Äúdynamics,‚Äù and there is some literature reflecting those modes of thought. The best known is Forester (1968), which set off an enormous amount of critique and some follow on thoughtful extensions (e.g., Chen (ed), 1972) Robert Crosby in the University Research Office of the US DOT was very much interested in the applications of dynamics to urban analysis, and when the DOT program was active some work was sponsored (Kahn (ed) 1981). The funding for that work ended, and we doubt if any new work was seeded. The analyses discussed use land rent ideas. The direct relation between transportation and land rent is assumed, e.g., as per Stevens. There is some work that takes a less simple view of land rent. An interesting example is Thrall (1987). Thrall introduces a consumption theory of land rent that includes income effects; utility is broadly considered. Thrall manages both to simplify analytic treatment making the theory readily accessible and develop insights about policy and transportation. Future land use can be forecasted by using methods of Artificial Intelligence and discrete mathematics (Papadimitriou, 2012).

Clar√≠n, 31 December 2004. Tragedia en un boliche de Once: m√°s de 175 muertos y 102 heridos en estado cr√≠tico. History The band was formed in mid-1995 by a group of young people of Villa Celina, Greater Buenos Aires. They were known initially as R√≠o Verde (\\"Green River\\") and mostly played covers of Chuck Berry, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota. At the end of 1996 the band changed its lineup and recruited new members. Given the extensive change to the original group, in January 1997, they changed their name to Callejeros. A new guitarist and a saxophonist came into the band between late 1999 and early 2000, and it is with this lineup that Callejeros recorded the three albums it has released to date. In 2001 they recorded their first album, Sed (\\"Thirst\\"), in which they followed the rock format they had kept for years, but with the participation of sax player Juan Carbone, former member of Viejas Locas. A single came out of this album, Vicioso, jugador y mujeriego, and a video was made for it, but did not see much TV airtime. Their second album, Presi√≥n (\\"Pressure\\"), also self-released, came out in 2003. It premiered at the Atlanta football stadium in Buenos Aires and it included fourteen songs, ranging in style from tango, ballad, rhythms of candombe (black music from Uruguay) and Latin rock up to classic rock'n'roll. This record made their name known in almost the whole country and, to some degree, in Latin America. Not long after the release of the album, the first single, Una nueva noche fr√≠a (\\"A New Cold Night\\"), was aired on radio and music TV stations during several months. After playing at the Obras Sanitarias Stadium, known in Buenos Aires as the \\"temple of rock\\", in 2004, it seemed as if the band would reach far, because of its growth in popularity in such a short time. In a six months span, they went from drawing less than a thousand people, to play in arenas with capacity of five thousand or more attendees. In late 2004, they released their third album, Rocanroles sin destino (\\"Rock 'n roll without Destiny\\"). It did not have the \\"power\\" of previous albums, but more attention went into describing themselves, their lives, their career as musicians and the conflicts that fame brings. The album was played live twice: First in C√≥rdoba, in front of ten thousand people, and then in the Club Atl√©tico Excursionistas football stadium, for an audience of almost fifteen thousand people.  Croma√±√≥n  The night of December 30, 2004, the band played a concert at the club Rep√∫blica Cromagnon, in Buenos Aires. During the show, someone in the audience lit a small firework that threw light balls up, which impacted a plastic fibre net that held the acoustical panels (made of foam rubber, to lower costs) and combustion begun. The club was overcrowded (there were more than four thousand attendees, and it had a capacity of two thousand people) and the emergency exits had been (illegally) locked from the outside. The fire spread and eventually killed 194 people, mostly due to burnings in the respiratory tract and inhalation of carbon monoxide. Among the dead spectators were relatives of various band members, as well as the band manager's wife and the lead singer's girlfriend. The band was investigated by the authorities regarding their responsibility in the tragedy, because it was well known that the audience frequently made use of pyrotechnic devices during their shows; though in this case Callejeros had asked them not to, to no avail. In April 2011, the six band members were convicted of murder.Rock band convicted over fatal concert fire - Richard Reynolds - Australian Broadcasting Corporation (21 April 2011) Retrieved 21 April 2011. After Croma√±√≥n After Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n, Callejeros did not play for a long time. First, due to their own decision, then because of the opposition from the relatives of victims of the fire. In May 2006, the band released their fourth album, Se√±ales (\\"Signs\\"), which sold 20,000 copies on its release day. The band signed a contract with Pelo Music and had both previous albums re-released (Sed and Presi√≥n) by this company. On July 6, 2006, Callejeros appeared without prior announcement during a concert of the band J√≥venes Pordioseros, in El Teatro, a club in Flores, Buenos Aires. The band had previously agreed not to go on stage, and the show was suspended by the management of the club. Later, relatives of the victims expressed mixed opinions about it; some claimed that the band had \\"the right\\" to play because there was no judicial order to keep them from doing so, while others called it \\"a mistake\\", or claimed that they should be in prison. After the tragedy, the band played five more times, always outside Buenos Aires city. The last time in Olavarr√≠a, Buenos Aires Province. Clar√≠n, 7 July 2006. Sorpresivamente, Callejeros volvi√≥ a tocar y todo termin√≥ en esc√°ndalo. Clar√≠n, 7 July 2006. La vuelta de Callejeros gener√≥ apoyo y repudio entre familiares de las v√≠ctimas de Croma√±√≥n.  Second trial  In April 2011, an appeal court retried them and found the members of the band guilty, sentencing each of them to eleven years in prison.NYT In October 2012, band members were sentenced to 7 years of prison, making it effective at that moment. Founding member Fontanet was moved to a psychiatric clinic in C√≥rdoba. On June 10, 2013, he moved from the clinic in C√≥rdoba to the Ezeiza prison psychiatric ward. He traveled in an ambulance accompanied by his girlfriend Stephanie Miguel and a mobile Federal Prison Service.On August 6, 2014, the Supreme Court granted the extraordinary appeal filed by the gang, releasing them pending a new ruling. However, in April 2016, the Criminal Cassation Chamber, upon reviewing the ruling, sentenced Patricio Santos Fontanet to 7 years in prison and 5 years to the rest of the musicians. Currently all musicians except Eduardo V√°zquez are on probation, after having served two thirds of the custodial sentence.

It is ivory in color when raw, with more processed versions being white, although it is commonly dyed yellow with borututu root or palm oil. It is widely used in cosmetics as a moisturizer, salve or lotion. Shea butter is edible and is used in food preparation in some African countries. Occasionally, shea butter is mixed with other oils as a substitute for cocoa butter, although the taste is noticeably different. The English word \\"shea\\" comes from s‚Äô√≠, the tree's name in Bambara. It is known by many local names, e.g., Kpakahili in Dagbani, taama in Waala, nkuto in Twi, ka…óe or ka…óanya in Hausa, √íkw√πm√° in Igbo language, √≤r√≠ in Yoruba language, karit√© in the Wolof language of Senegal, ori in some parts of West Africa, and many others. History The common name is sh√≠su (lit. \\"shea tree\\") in the Bambara language of Mali. This is the origin of the English word, the primary pronunciation of which is (rhyming with \\"tea\\"), although the pronunciation (rhyming with \\"day\\") is common and is listed second in major dictionaries. The tree is called ghariti in the Wolof language of Senegal, which is the origin of the French name of the tree and the butter, karit√©. The shea tree grows naturally in the wild in the dry savannah belt of West Africa from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east, and onto the foothills of the Ethiopian highlands. It occurs in 21 countries across the African continent, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and Guinea. A testa found at the site of the medieval village of Saouga is evidence of shea butter production by the 14th century.*Neumann, K., et al. 1998. Remains of woody plants from Saouga, a medieval west African village. Vegetation History and Archaeobotany, 7:57-77.

Composition and properties Shea butter extract is a complex fat that in addition to many nonsaponifiable components (substances that cannot be fully converted into soap by treatment with alkali) contains the following fatty acids: oleic acid (40‚Äì60%), stearic acid (20‚Äì50%), linoleic acid (3‚Äì11%), palmitic acid (2‚Äì9%), linolenic acid (<1%) and arachidic acid (<1%). Shea butter melts at body temperature. Proponents of its use for skin care maintain that it absorbs rapidly into the skin, acts as a \\"refatting\\" agent, and has good water-binding properties.  Uses  Shea butter soap Shea butter is mainly used in the cosmetics industry for skin- and hair-related products (lip gloss, lip stick, skin moisturizer creams and emulsions, and hair conditioners for dry and brittle hair). It is also used by soap makers and massage oil manufacturers, typically in small amounts, because it has plenty of unsaponifiables, and higher amounts result in a softer soap that has less cleaning ability. Some artisan soap makers use shea butter in amounts to 25% ‚Äì with the European Union regulating the maximum use around 28%, but it is rarely the case in commercially produced soap due to its high cost compared to oils like palm oil or pomace (olive oil). It is an excellent emollient for dry skin. No evidence shows it is a cure, but it alleviates the pain associated with tightness and itching. In some African countries such as Benin, shea butter is used for cooking oil, as a waterproofing wax, for hairdressing, for candle-making, and as an ingredient in medicinal ointments. It is used by makers of traditional African percussion instruments to increase the durability of wood (such as carved djembe shells), dried calabash gourds, and leather tuning straps. Medicinal Shea butter is sometimes used as a base for medicinal ointments. Some of the isolated chemical constituents are reported to have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, emollient, and humectant properties. Shea butter has been used as a sunblocking lotion and some of its components \\"have limited capacity to absorb ultraviolet radiation\\". In Ghana, shea butter locally known as Kpakahili (Eng. trans. raw cream) in Dagbani, nkuto (Akan) or nku (Ga), is either used as a food product or applied as lotion to protect the skin during the dry Harmattan season. The shea nut tree itself is called t√°√°≈ã√† (pl. t√°√°ns√¨) and the fruit is called t√°√°n√¨ (pl. t√°m√°). The current northern regional capital Tamale, derives it names from a combination of the words \\"tama\\" and \\"yili\\", meaning \\"the town of shea fruits\\". In Nigeria, shea butter is used for the management of sinusitis and relief of nasal congestion. It is massaged into joints and other parts of the body where pain occurs. Classification The United States Agency for International Development and other companies have suggested a classification system for shea butter, separating it into five grades: * A (raw or unrefined, extracted using water) * B (refined) * C (highly refined and extracted with solvents such as hexane) * D (lowest uncontaminated grade) * E (with contaminants). Commercial grades are A, B, and C. The color of raw (grade A) butter ranges from cream (like whipped butter) to grayish yellow. It has a nutty aroma which is removed in the other grades. Grade C is pure white. While the level of vitamin content can be affected by refining, up to 95% of vitamin content can be removed from refined grades (i.e., grade C) of shea butter while reducing contamination levels to undetectable levels.

The Broadcasting Act 1976 then reformed NZBC as the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand (BCNZ). The corporation was dissolved on 1 April 1975, and replaced by three separate organisations: Radio New Zealand, Television One, and Television Two, later known as South Pacific Television. The television channels would merge again in 1980 to become Television New Zealand, while Radio New Zealand remained unchanged. History At 7:30pm on 1 June 1960, New Zealand's first television channel, AKTV2, started broadcasting in Auckland from the NZBC building at 74 Shortland Street, previously used to broadcast public radio station 1YA and now home to The University of Auckland's Gus Fisher Gallery. Owned and operated by the New Zealand Broadcasting Service. With the passing of the Broadcasting Corporation Act 1961, the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation was established, with F. J. Llewellyn as its chairman. During the course of the Bill through the House of Representatives in the session of 1961, provision was made for the establishment of privately owned stations and, although strongly opposed by the Labour Opposition, this became part of the Act. But before such stations could be established, the corporation, which took office on 1 April 1962, was required to undertake a review of existing coverage. At the time of transfer, the Corporation assumed responsibility for the control of 35 radio stations and four television stations. The number of licence holders for sound radio grew to more than 600,000. The tremendous appeal of television was demonstrated by the fact that in the first three-year period of development the number of licence holders reached a total of 275,000 (November 1964). The annual income from all sources exceeded NZ¬£5,000,000, more than NZ¬£250,000 being paid in taxation. Initially, the four television facilities were unlinked, and programming had to be shipped between each station. However, for urgent news video, it was possible to link the two stations in each island using Post Office Telephone Department (now Chorus) coaxial toll lines at the expense of a number of voice channels. This method was too costly for the regular programming. The most notable example of the unlinked facilities was when the inter-island ferry sank in Wellington Harbour on 10 April 1968 ‚Äì newscasts of the disaster had to be transmitted over Post Office lines by WNTV1 to AKTV2 in Auckland. However, due to the storm disrupting both shipping and flights for a further 24 hours, the first video of the sinking crossed Cook Strait via regular transmissions from WNTV1 and was received on a privately owned television set in Blenheim, at the top of the South Island some 80 km line-of-sight distance from Wellington. A Blenheim-based news reporter's film camera was pointed at the television, then the exposed film was rushed by road to Christchurch, developed and transmitted over CHTV3, concurrently sent further south to DNTV2 for transmission there via a coax cable link. This Blenheim film appears to be the only surviving footage of the first day, and it shows part of the television set that the camera was pointed at. By the time of the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969, the two islands were each network-capable via microwave link, but the link over Cook Strait had not been completed, and there was no link between New Zealand and the outside world. Footage of the moon landing was recorded on video tape at the Australian Broadcasting Commission's ABN-2 in Sydney, then rushed by an RNZAF English Electric Canberra to Wellington and WNTV1.\\"Television viewers in New Zealand were unable to see the Apollo 11 Moonwalk live.\\" Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station To forward this to the South Island, the NZBC positioned one of its first outside broadcasting vans to beam the footage to a receiving dish across Cook Strait, from which it was forwarded through the recently commissioned South Island network. The link was completed later that year, the first NZBC Network News transmitted on 3 November, read by Dougal Stevenson. The NZBC's microwave network between facilities was very much ad hoc. Due to a shortage of microwave links, the network was completed by \\"off air\\" hops, where a 100 kW regional transmitter was received and re-transmitted by another. The network news was made possible by switching inputs to the regional transmitters, so that a signal could be relayed across the country. For instance, the Te Aroha regional transmitter for Hamilton could be switched away from Auckland programming to relay off-air, the Wellington signal coming up the country. Auckland then could see Wellington via Te Aroha. The non- synchronous switching was done manually initially and later with tone switching. During the network news presented from Wellington, if an inject was required from Auckland, Auckland would switch from transmitting Wellington pictures to transmitting, briefly a black screen with a small white \\"A\\" in the corner. Then each transmitter down the country would have to switch over so that the \\"A\\" would eventually appear in Wellington and beyond. Once all centres could see the \\"A\\" caption, the Auckland inject would be played. At the end of the item, the process would be reversed with a \\"W\\" for Wellington being switched sequentially, and then finally the Wellington presenter would appear again in all centres. The viewer would see a black non-synchronous switch which would take a second or so. Eagle-eyed viewers could see the identification letters change on the corner of the screen. Those with poor vertical hold would have to wait a little longer for the picture to stabilise. Occasionally, a transmitter would be switched out of sequence and the viewers would be treated to the sight of 100 kW of video feedback. With the establishment of the Warkworth satellite station in 1971, New Zealand could finally communicate with the rest of the world. The first live broadcast received by satellite was the 1971 Melbourne Cup on 2 November.50 years of NZTV newspaper insert, Television New Zealand, 31 August 2010 For the first 13 years, NZBC TV broadcast solely in black and white. Colour television, using the Phase alternating line (PAL) system, was introduced on 31 October 1973, in preparation for the 1974 British Commonwealth Games, held in Christchurch the following February. Due to the lack of colour facilities, only four of the ten sports (swimming, diving, athletics and boxing) could be broadcast in colour.Technology Changes Television, TVNZ Reorganisation and breakup The introduction of a second TV channel in 1975 also saw the reorganisation of broadcasting in New Zealand. On 1 April 1975, the NZBC was split into 3 separate state owned corporations: Television One, Television Two and Radio New Zealand. The existing NZBC television service became TV One, and was based in Avalon Television Centre in Lower Hutt which opened that day. TV One used the WNTV1 and DNTV2 studios and the existing channel frequencies, while AKTV2's Shortland Street studios and CHTV3 studios and new channel frequencies were used for the new TV2, which commenced later that year. TVNZ In 1980, TV One and South Pacific (known once again as TV2) were merged into a single organisation, Television New Zealand (TVNZ).

The doubloon (from Spanish dobl√≥n, meaning \\"double\\") was a two-escudo or 32-real gold coin, weighing 6.867 grams (0.218 troy ounces) in 1537, and 6.766 grams from 1728, of .917 fine gold (22-carat gold). Doubloons were minted in Spain and the viceroyalties of New Spain, Peru, and Nueva Granada (modern-day Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela). The term was first used to describe the golden excelente either because of its value of two ducats or because of the double portrait of Ferdinand and Isabella. In the New World, Spanish gold coins were minted in one, two, four, and eight escudo denominations. The two- escudo piece was called a \\"pistole\\"; the large eight-escudo coin was called a \\"quadruple pistole\\" or, at first, a double doubloon. English colonists would come to call it the Spanish doubloon. After the War of 1812, doubloons were valued in Nova Scotia at the rate of ¬£4 and became the dominant coin there.McCullough, Alan Bruce. Money and Exchange in Canada to 1900, Dundurn, 1984 Doubloons marked \\"2 S\\" are equivalent to four dollars in US gold coins and were traded in that manner. Small 1/2-escudo coins (similar to a US $1 gold piece) have no value marked on them but were worth a Spanish milled dollar in trade. In Spain, doubloons were current up to the middle of the 19th century. Isabella II of Spain replaced an escudo-based coinage with decimal reales in 1859, and replaced the 6.77-gram dobl√≥n with a new heavier dobl√≥n worth 100 reales and weighing 8.3771 grams (0.268 troy ounces). The last Spanish doubloons (showing the denomination as 80 reales) were minted in 1849. After their independence, the former Spanish Viceroyalties of Mexico, Peru and Nueva Granada continued to mint doubloons. In other countries Doubloons have also been minted in Portuguese colonies, where they went by the name dobr√£o, with the same meaning. The S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe dobra is the only extant currency with a name meaning \\"doubloon.\\" In Europe, the doubloon became the model for several other gold coins, including the French Louis d'or, the Italian doppia, the Swiss duplone, the Northern German pistole, and the Prussian Friedrich d'or. In present-day Canada, \\"doubloon\\" is occasionally used to describe to the Canadian two-dollar coin (the one-dollar coin is nicknamed the loonie, owing to its use of a Common loon on its reverse).

It is often used in giving quantities of liquid drugs to patients, and occasionally in cooking and in organic synthesis. The abbreviations gt or gtt come from the Latin noun gutta (\\"drop\\"). The volume of a drop is not well defined: it depends on the device and technique used to produce the drop, on the strength of the gravitational field, and on the viscosity, density, and the surface tension of the liquid. There are several exact definitions of a \\"drop\\": * In medicine, IV drips deliver 10, 15, 20, or 60 drops per mL. Micro-drip sets deliver 60 drops per mL and 10, 15, or 20 drops per mL for a macro-drip set.http://www.cwladis.com/math104/lecture7.php * Prior to the adoption of the minim in the early 19th century, the smallest unit of fluid measure in the Apothecaries' systems of the United States customary units and pre-1824 English units was, while inexact, presumed to be equal to 1/60 of a fluid dram or 1/480 of a fluid ounce. In organic synthesis, a synthetic procedure will often call for the addition of a reagent \\"dropwise\\" with the aid of a syringe or a dropping funnel. The rate of addition for such a procedure is taken to be slow, but is otherwise vague, since one chemist might consider dropwise to be one drop per second, while another might consider five to ten drops per second (almost a stream) to be dropwise. Furthermore, the volume of a drop will depend on needle gauge or the dimensions of the glassware. Thus, to improve reproducibility, noting the total amount of time required to add the liquid or another measure of addition rate in the experimental procedure is now considered prudent. In a related usage, the amount of a reagent, whose precise quantity is unimportant, will sometimes be given in terms of the number of drops, often from a glass pipette. In this usage, a drop is typically considered to be approximately 0.05 mL. Giving quantities this way was more common in the past but this practice is now generally considered to be sloppy or unrigorous. History In the first decade of the 19th century, the minim, the smallest unit of Apothecary Measure, was promoted by the pharmaceutical and medical establishments as an alternative to the drop. It was noted that the size of a drop can vary considerably depending on the viscosity and specific gravity of the fluid, as well as the size and shape of the vessel from which it is poured. (At the time, surface tension was not well understood.) The minim came with a set of procedures for ensuring accurate measurement, specifically, diluting powerful medicines that had previously been measured by the drop, then using a \\"minimometer\\" or \\"minim glass\\" (graduated pipette) with minim marks at regular intervals. The minim was defined as one 60th of a fluid dram or one 480th of a fluid ounce. This is equal to about 61.6 ŒºL (U.S.) or 59.2 ŒºL (Britain). Pharmacists have since moved to metric measurements, with a drop being rounded to exactly 0.05 mL (50 ŒºL, that is, 20 drops per milliliter). In hospitals, intravenous tubing is used to deliver medication in drops of various sizes ranging from 10 drops/mL to 60 drops/mL. A drop is abbreviated gtt, with gtts used for the plural, often seen on prescriptions. Other sources abbreviate gt for singular, and gtt for plural. These abbreviations come from gutta (plural guttae), the Latin word for drop.

The establishment of its own news division marked a new era in the company's history, since it finally became an independent organisation. G.J. Ho, son of George Ho, is now the chairman of CRHK. The licence of CRHK was renewed on 22 July 2003 and will last for another 12 years until 26 August 2016. The statutory body Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority continue to regulate Hong Kong broadcasters. Channels Currently CRHK broadcasts through two Cantonese Channels on the FM band and an English one on the AM band. All of the channels are 24-hour broadcast and each of them has its distinct programme formats and audience. FM 88.1 CR1 FM 88.1 () has the widest audience base in Hong Kong. It is a talk-based channel which broadcasts current affairs, traffic and financial information. There are also many talk shows and interactive phone-in shows. It also offers some cultural dramas programmes. Its target audience are 25- to 40-year-old professionals. Its current slogan is \\"\\" (Jyutping: gong2 hoeng1 gong2 jan4 waa6), which literally means \\"Speak as a Hongkonger\\". FM 90.3 CR2 FM 90.3 () is a music-based channel targeted at the younger generation and audience who are interested in pop music. The programmes feature the latest news in pop music, including Cantonese, Japanese and English songs. This channel is also known for organising one of the four Hong Kong annual music awards, in which the prizes are awarded to the singers according to how often their songs are plugged, as they call it in Hong Kong, by the DJs. Its present slogan is \\"\\", which the literal meaning is \\"Ultimate 903, reverse and reverse, Team 309\\". This slogan also promote the channel's line up, Team 309. AM 864 AM 864 () is an English channel. It used to offer a diversity of music, from the latest international hits to hip-hop, R&B;, jazz, rock and roll, grunge music. It was intended to cater toward audiences all around the world. Audiences could keep up with the latest news, especially with global issues, through CRHK. News were broadcast every hour throughout the day, with weather forecast and traffic reports. In addition, it regularly produced news reports and public affairs programmes. From 2000‚Äì2003, AM864 was partnered with HMV and was called HMV 864. Amongst other name, Quote 864 was also used as an on- air name. In 2004 the station became all music, i.e. without presenters, and only breaking for the hourly news. The format is hit music from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Notable programmes=FM 88.1 Among all 88.1 Programmes, there are three programmes that actively discuss contemporary Hong Kong political, social and economic issues every day. \\"On a Clear Day\\" airs during the weekdays, from Monday to Friday, from 6am to 10am. This four-hour programme is hosted by Stephen Chan, Chan Chung and Ken Kwok. The hosts make the programme more interactive by inviting some of the audience and sometimes guests to participate in the discussion of current issues. The programme has a session called voice column in which some Commercial Radio DJs participate as columnists, sharing their own viewpoints on certain issues, e.g. the column \\"\\" by To Kit, who has worked for the British Broadcasting Corporation for 8 years. \\"Circles\\" airs during Monday to Friday 10:30am to 12:00pm, and weekends 1:00pm to 4:00pm. This programme is focusing with the interview with the celebrities and special guests. \\"Summit\\" airs during Monday to Friday 11:00pm to 12:00am. This programme is hosted by Chip Tsao and special hosts. It is a talk programme focusing on the current affairs in Hong Kong, international relations, and culture related stuffs. FM 90.3 Among all 90.3 Programmes, there are two programmes that actively discuss contemporary Hong Kong political, social and economic issues every day, in a more relaxed way to telling that. \\"On a Clear Day\\" airs during the weekdays, from Monday to Friday, from 8am to 10am. This two-hour programme is hosted by Jan Lamb, Ken Yuen and Poon Siu To. The hosts make the programme more interactive by inviting some of the audience and sometimes guests to participate in the discussion of current issues, in a more comedy way. The programme has a session called voice column in which some Commercial Radio DJs participate as columnists, sharing their own viewpoints on certain issues, e.g. the column \\"\\" by To Kit, who has worked for the British Broadcasting Corporation for 8 years. \\"Good Morning King\\" airs during the weekdays, from Monday to Friday, from 10am to 12pm. This programme is hosted by Sammy Leung, Kitty Yuen and Marco Hung. AM 864 Two new foreign-language radio programmes ‚Äì \\"Hong Kong-Pak This Evening\\" in Urdu and \\"Nepal Darshan\\" in Nepali ‚Äì were launched jointly by Commercial Radio and the Home Affairs Bureau from 18 June 2005, to promote multi-culturalism in Hong Kong. It aims at strengthening the sense of belonging of the ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, but at the same time retaining their cultural identities and differences. Another program is Good Evening Kabayan. It is for the Filipino community in Hong Kong. The programmes broadcast for 26 consecutive Saturdays on Commercial Radio Channel 1 (AM864) until 10 December 2005. \\"Hong Kong-Pak This Evening\\" and \\"Nepal Darshan\\" were on air from 08:00pm to 08:30pm and from 08:30pm to 09:00pm respectively. The Urdu programme was hosted by Abid Ali Baig, who is a poet and writer, who had been working in the broadcasting industry for 30 years in Pakistan; whereas the Nepali one was hosted by Pushpa Kumar Rai, who had worked in the former British Forces Broadcasting Service for almost 20 years and he is familiar to many Nepalese ears in Hong Kong. The programmes comprise mainly music, news, sport, current affairs and community services related to the respective ethnic groups; local celebrities from the ethnic groups were also invited to talk about their own cultures and their assimilation into the community. Controversy and criticism In the middle of 2004, three of the programme hosts were all well known for their out-spoken hosting style over social and political matters. Suddenly, all three announced they would stop. Albert Cheng Jing Han announced a hiatus from hosting his programme in April 2004, claiming pressure from the Chinese government, and announced his resignation by the end of July. Another famous political programme host Raymond Wong Yuk-man announced his decision to quit his own programme on the 13 May claiming there was threat to his family's safety. However, he decided to rejoin CRHK to host a brand new programme for the station in October 2004. Allen Lee Peng Fei replaced Cheng Jing Han who announced his resignation on the 19 May also for political reasons. Freedom of speech has been a concern in Hong Kong since the 1997 Handover. In May 2010, the memory of Lam Bun was evoked after CR allowed the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong to sponsor a political radio programme. Activists protested outside the station with images of Lam, a CR host who was assassinated during the 1967 riots and who became an icon of free speech, complaining that the station had desecrated his memory. The DAB said the shows were about livelihood issues, and denied they promoted a political stance.Chan, Kobi (16 May 2010). \\"Activists held after attack on DAB-sponsored show\\", South China Morning Post In late 2013, as a prelude to the renewal of its broadcasting licence, CR replaced outspoken critic of CY Leung who hosted an influential prime-time morning talk show. Lee Wai-ling, long despised by the pro-establishment camp for her vocal criticism of the government, was abruptly shunted to a less prominent evening show and replaced by station chief executive Stephen Chan Chi-wan. Chan denied political motivations were involved. But one former media executive said that it was \\"an open secret\\" that some outspoken programme hosts disliked by the government have to leave at the time of licence renewal, as media operators are under considerable political pressure.Vivienne Chow, Stuart Lau and Tanna Chong (16 November 2013) \\"Station takes outspoken host off prime-time show\\" South China Morning Post Commercial Radio Production Commercial Radio Production Co. Ltd. (CRP) was established in 1997 to produce radio commercials themselves for their partners, but it has also become a brand of its own now. It aims at providing faster and more updated information and an entertainment platform to the public in the future. It also keeps on providing market- promotion service to its customers. Productions CRP organises different kinds of concerts and outdoor activities, such as \\"Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation\\", \\"903 id club Music is Life Concert\\", \\"Famine 30\\" . Also, CRP holds different forms of gathering for the audience of CRHK, such as \\"903id club\\"; these activities thus provide a platform and more chances for both the DJs and the audience to communicate with each other. In addition, CRP has been issuing their company products, including books and stationery, to promote its own brand. Art room While producing and organising different kinds of activities, a large number of art products are needed, such as pamphlets, posters and even the stage design of the \\"Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation\\". It fosters creativity and the production of aesthetic artwork. The Basement There has always been keen competition amongst Hong Kong radio stations. Recently, CRP launches video production services and issues \\"903 Music on the Move\\". In this programme, music and pictures are combined and it creates a new definition for radio production. This combination is then moved on to mobile phone service, creating another new medium for radio and music and hence for the users. 881903.com CRHK has launched 881903.com in 1995 as the official website of Commercial Radio Hong Kong. CRP is the administrative organisation of 881903.com. The signal is retransmitted through the internet and anyone can listen to it online. Although only the Cantonese version is available, it acts as a platform for the radio station to promote its programmes and related products. In fact, internet users can find updated news and financial information, programme schedule, programme synopsis and even personal pages of the DJs. By logging onto the page, people from all over the world can listen to Radio 1 and 2. Members of 881903.com can have access to past radio programmes as well. An open forum can also be found on 881903.com which allows the audience to leave comments on the radio programmes or the DJs. Because of its rising popularity, a multimedia marketing platform is formed which enables CRP to target a larger audience, especially from overseas countries. Extra revenue is gained from its advertisers such as Netvigator, ICQ and Motorola. By having an online radio station, the audience can enjoy greater convenience and more flexibility in listening to the radio and it also helps globalise their programmes, hence the radio station. my903.com In 2006, CRHK has launched a dedicated website MY903.com (formerly 90345678.com and 903456.com) for its CR2 channel. This website uses an interactive and eye-catching layout to make closer connection between programme audiences and hosts. Thus creating a promotion platform for special features in prime programmes. In 2007, MY 903 FORUM launched its beta version. This enables instant discussion on programmes between hosts and audiences and an alternative platform for channel opinions. 903 id Club \\"903id Club\\" is an organisation established by Radio 2, CRHK, where \\"id\\" stands for \\"I Dream\\", \\"I Discover\\", \\"I Dare\\" and \\"I Decide\\". 903id club aims at promoting local music and is a trend setter for local teenagers. For example, it is one of the organisers of is Life Concert>>, which attracts thousands of audience every year. It also promotes new films and introduces the latest trend to the public. Besides, 903id club creates a channel for music and film lovers to share their thoughts and interests. This once again shows CRP's emphasis on audience's involvement. Moreover, 903id club is linked to several radio programmes, such as \\"Sammy Moving\\" and some of the DJs of those programmes work on projects supported by the club. One of the very successful examples is the annual drama performance done by Sammy Leung Chi-Kin and Kitty Yuen Siu- Yee. Another success story is the boy group I love you boyz, formed by popular DJs Jim Yan and Donald. The group is known for their exaggerating and eerie comedic image. High-profile DJ Jan Lamb has also hosted a series of stand-up comedy shows produced by CR Productions. Also, members of 903id club can have discounts in various shops e.g. Laneige and join activities organised by the club. This reinforces the audience's sense of belonging to the channels.

He was a chieftain of Tujue in 650 inside Chanyu territory (near modern Tsetserleg, Mongolia). His father and grandfather served as tuduns.  Reign  After defeat of Ashina Funian, he left for the Mongolian steppe, from where he raised an army of 17 generals and 5,000 men. He started with an attack on Huige in 681. He reconquered most of the lands of the first Eastern Turkic Khaganate, founding the Second Turkic Khaganate. In 682 Xue Rengui was commissioned to attack Ashide Yuanzhen, now an aide of Ilterish. His presence intimidated Tujue soldiers, who had thought that he was long dead, and he scored a major victory over Ashide Yuanzhen. Nevertheless in 683, qaghan attacked Wei Prefecture (ËîöÂ∑û, roughly modern Datong, Shanxi) and killed its prefect Li Sijian (ÊùéÊÄùÂÑâ). When Tang Xiujing's superior, Cui Zhibian (Â¥îÊô∫ËæØ) the commandant at Feng Prefecture, tried to intercept qaghan at Mount Zhaona (ÊúùÈÇ£Â±±, in modern Baotou, Inner Mongolia), he was defeated and captured. In response, Emperor Gaozong considered withdrawing from Feng Prefecture and moving its residents to Ling (ÈùàÂ∑û, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia) and Xia (Â§èÂ∑û, roughly modern Yulin) Prefectures. By 683, Wang Benli was serving as the commandant at Sheng Prefecture (ÂãùÂ∑û, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), khagan attacked the nearby Chanyu Protector General headquarters (ÂñÆ‰∫éÁ∏ΩÁù£Â∫ú, also in modern Hohhot), capturing and killing the official Zhang Xingshi (ÂºµË°åÂ∏´). Emperor Gaozong sent Wang, along with Li Chongyi (ÊùéÂ¥áÁæ©), the commandant at Xia Prefecture (Â§èÂ∑û, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi), to defend against Tujue attack, but historical accounts did not indicate what the results were. In 687, another invasion of Tang by khagan and Ashide Yuanzhen (ÈòøÂè≤Âæ∑ÂÖÉÁèç) began. Empress Dowager Wu commissioned the ethnically Baekje general Heichi Changzhi, assisted by Li Duozuo, to defend against Tujue attack and they were able to defeat Tujue forces at Huanghuadui (ÈªÉËä±Â†Ü, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), causing Tujue forces to flee. In general, during his reign raids were frequent, reaching almost 40 invasions by Tujue, 20 of them were personally commanded by khagan himself. He appointed brothers Ashina Mochuo and Ashina Duoxifu as shads and yabgus. He was succeeded by his brother, Qapaghan Qaghan, because his son Bilge was too young. Family Ilterish Qaghan was the head of the Ashina and distantly related to the Khagans of the first G√∂kt√ºrk Khaganate.

International organisations like IEEE and ISO have published standards for software test documentation. Status of IEEE 829 Note: IEEE 829-2008 has been superseded by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2013. Background to IEEE 829 IEEE 829-2008, also known as the 829 Standard for Software and System Test Documentation, was an IEEE standard that specified the form of a set of documents for use in eight defined stages of software testing and system testing, each stage potentially producing its own separate type of document. The standard specified the format of these documents, but did not stipulate whether they must all be produced, nor did it include any criteria regarding adequate content for these documents. These were a matter of judgment outside the purview of the standard. Documents Required by IEEE 829 The documents are: *Master Test Plan (MTP): The purpose of the Master Test Plan (MTP) is to provide an overall test planning and test management document for multiple levels of test (either within one project or across multiple projects). *Level Test Plan (LTP): For each LTP the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of the testing activities for its specified level of testing need to be described. The items being tested, the features to be tested, the testing tasks to be performed, the personnel responsible for each task, and the associated risk(s) need to be identified. *Level Test Design (LTD): Detailing test cases and the expected results as well as test pass criteria. *Level Test Case (LTC): Specifying the test data for use in running the test cases identified in the Level Test Design. *Level Test Procedure (LTPr): Detailing how to run each test, including any set-up preconditions and the steps that need to be followed. *Level Test Log (LTL): To provide a chronological record of relevant details about the execution of tests, e.g. recording which tests cases were run, who ran them, in what order, and whether each test passed or failed. *Anomaly Report (AR): To document any event that occurs during the testing process that requires investigation. This may be called a problem, test incident, defect, trouble, issue, anomaly, or error report. This document is deliberately named as an anomaly report, and not a fault report. The reason is that a discrepancy between expected and actual results can occur for a number of reasons other than a fault in the system. These include the expected results being wrong, the test being run incorrectly, or inconsistency in the requirements meaning that more than one interpretation could be made. The report consists of all details of the incident such as actual and expected results, when it failed, and any supporting evidence that will help in its resolution. The report will also include, if possible, an assessment of the impact of an incident upon testing. *Level Interim Test Status Report (LITSR): To summarise the interim results of the designated testing activities and optionally to provide evaluations and recommendations based on the results for the specific test level. *Level Test Report (LTR): To summarise the results of the designated testing activities and to provide evaluations and recommendations based on the results after test execution has finished for the specific test level. *Master Test Report (MTR): To summarise the results of the levels of the designated testing activities and to provide evaluations based on these results. This report may be used by any organisation using the MTP. A management report providing any important information uncovered by the tests accomplished, and including assessments of the quality of the testing effort, the quality of the software system under test, and statistics derived from Anomaly Reports. The report also records what testing was done and how long it took, in order to improve any future test planning. This final document is used to indicate whether the software system under test is fit for purpose according to whether or not it has met acceptance criteria defined by project stakeholders. Use of IEEE 829 The standard formed part of the training syllabus of the ISEB Foundation and Practitioner Certificates in Software Testing promoted by the British Computer Society. ISTQB, following the formation of its own syllabus based on ISEB's and Germany's ASQF syllabi, also adopted IEEE 829 as the reference standard for software and system test documentation. Dr. David Gelperin and Dr. William C. Hetzel developed the Systematic Test and Evaluation Process (STEP) methodology in order to implement the original IEEE-829 Standard for Software Test Documentation.

Augustin Fran√ßois C√©sar Prouven√ßal de Saint-Hilaire (4 October 17793 September 1853), French botanist and traveler, was born at Orl√©ans, France, on 4 October 1779. A keen observer, he is credited with important discoveries in botany, notably the direction of the radicle in the embryo sac and the double point of attachment of certain ovules. He also described two families, the Paronychiae and the Tamariscinae, as well as many genera and species. Biography He began to publish memoirs on botanical subjects at an early age. Between 1816 and 1822 and again in 1830, he traveled in South America, especially in south and central Brazil, and the results of his study of the rich flora of the regions through which he passed appeared in several books and numerous articles in scientific journals. In his first voyage, from 1816 to 1822, he explored the Brazilian backlands, traveling ca. 9,000 km, from Southeast Brazil to R√≠o de la Plata, including the former Cisplatina Province (Uruguay). He was able to gather 24,000 specimens of plants, with 6,000 species, 2,000 birds, 16,000 insects and 135 mammals, plus many reptiles, mollusks and fishes. Most of these species were described for the first time. In the next years he devoted himself to the study, classification, description and publication of this huge material, but he was considerably impaired by his ill health, due to diseases contracted during the tropical travels. In 1819 he was appointed correspondent of the Acad√©mie des Sciences. He was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur at the level of Chevalier, and the Portuguese Order of Christ.  Works  The works by which he is best known are the Flora Brasiliae Meridionalis in three volumes (1825‚Äì1832), published in conjunction with Adrien-Henri de Jussieu and Jacques Cambess√®des, and illustrated by Pierre Jean Fran√ßois Turpin; Histoire des Plantes les plus Remarquables du Br√©sil et du Paraguay (1824), Plantes Usu√©lles des Br√©siliens (1827‚Äì1828), also in conjunction with de Jussieu and Cambess√®des(1828); and Voyage Dans le District des Diamants et sur le littoral du Br√©sil, in two volumes (1833). His Le√ßons de Botanique, Compr√©nant Principalement la Morphologie V√©getale (1840), was a comprehensive exposition of botanical morphology and of its application to systematic botany.

Early life Patterson was born on Long Island, New York.Fredriksen, 1999 p.566 His father, John Patterson, was a younger brother of Walter Patterson, who was the first Royal Governor of Prince Edward Island (then named St. John's Island). John and Walter came to America in the 1750s from Ramelton or Rathmullan, County Donegal, Ireland, and served in the British Army in the French and Indian War. Daniel Patterson's mother, Catherine Livingston (1744‚Äì1832), was a daughter of the \\"Third Lord of the Manor\\" of Livingston, Robert Livingston (1708‚Äì1790) (also see Livingston family). James Duane, a respected lawyer, patriot, New York politician, and judge, was Daniel Patterson's uncle (by marriage to Patterson's aunt, his mother's sister Mary Livingston). Naval career As acting midshipman, he joined the sloop of war , June 11, 1799, to cruise against French privateers and warships in the West Indies to August 1800. Appointed a midshipman on August 20, 1800 (warrant subsequently altered to take rank from date of his original entry, June 11, 1799). After the war, was one of the midshipmen retained in the Navy under the Peace Establishment Act, signed by President Adams in one of his last official acts, on March 3, 1801. On close of the Quasi-War with France, he resumed nautical studies, then had blockade duty off Tripoli in and . On October 13, 1803 he fell prisoner upon capture of Philadelphia, commanded by William Bainbridge, when the vessel ran aground on an uncharted reef of the coast of Tripoli, and remained a captive of the Barbary pirates until the American victory over Tripoli in 1805.Fredriksen, 1999 p.566 Upon returning home, he spent much of his following years on station at New Orleans, Louisiana, where he took command after the outbreak of the War of 1812. On September 16, 1814, Patterson raided the base of the pirate Jean Laffite at Barataria Bay, capturing six schooners and other small craft. In that same month, he refused Andrew Jackson's request to send his few naval units to Mobile Bay where Patterson knew they would be bottled up by a superior British fleet. Foreseeing British designs against New Orleans almost two months before their attack, Patterson, not Jackson, was the first to prepare to defend the city. The American victory at the Battle of New Orleans resulted as much from his foresight and preparations as from Jackson's able fighting. His little fleet delayed the enemy until reinforcements arrived, then gave artillery support in defense of the entrenchments from which Jackson was never driven. Patterson, highly commended by Jackson, received a note of thanks from Congress, and was promoted to Captain on February 28, 1815. Patterson remained on the southern stations until 1824. Because of failing health, Thomas Macdonough relinquished command of whereupon Patterson then assumed command and became fleet captain and commander of this flagship in Commodore John Rodgers' Mediterranean Squadron. Grave at Congressional Cemetery Gold 'Freedom of the City Box' for Daniel T. Patterson, made by Jonathan Wilmarth, John L. Moffat, and Joseph Curtis, New York City, 1832 Returning home in 1828, he was appointed one of the three Navy commissioners. He commanded the Mediterranean Squadron from 1832‚Äì1836. He then took command of the Washington Navy Yard in 1836, an office he held until his death at Wilmington, Delaware, August 25, 1839. Daniel Todd Patterson and his wife are buried in Congressional Cemetery, Washington, D.C. The Life of Gould, an Ex- Man-of-War's Man, by Roland Gould (1867), noted on a website of the Navy Department Library at the Washington Navy Yard, purportedly contains a first- person account of the death of Commodore Patterson. Rank Although Patterson is properly called a \\"Commodore\\", during his years in the Navy this was not one of the hierarchical \\"line\\" ranks. Instead, \\"Commodore\\" applied to any officer in command of a fleet of two or more ships, regardless of the officer's \\"line\\" rank at the time, and regardless of whether the officer also held the dual role of commanding officer of one of the ships in the fleet. Thus Patterson was a Commodore at the time of the Battle of New Orleans because he commanded a fleet of ships, even though he was not promoted to the \\"line\\" rank of Captain until after the battle. He again became a Commodore when in command of the Mediterranean Squadron. Patterson was never an Admiral because in his day the highest \\"line\\" rank in the US Navy was Captain; the title Admiral was felt to smack of aristocracy and royalty, and did not become a \\"line\\" rank in the US Navy until the Civil War. Family His children include Carlile Pollock Patterson, Thomas Harmon Patterson, Eliza Catherine Patterson ‚Äì wife of George Mifflin Bache, Sr., and George Ann Patterson ‚Äì wife of David Dixon Porter. Patterson's wife, George Ann Pollock of New Orleans, is worth noting because her parents, George Pollock and Catherine Yates Pollock, and her maternal grandparents, Richard Yates and Catherine Brass Yates, had their portraits painted by Gilbert Stuart, in 1793‚Äì1794. All four of the portraits are in the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. The portrait of Mrs. Richard Yates (Catherine Brass Yates) is particularly well-known. Richard Yates and his son-in-law George Pollock were successful merchants in New York, with their firm Yates & Pollock. But they were driven out of business around 1800, when their ships and cargoes were seized by French privateers during the Quasi-War. Pollock moved to New Orleans, where his uncle Oliver Pollock, a financier of patriot operations during the Revolution, had been in business. Commodore Patterson's great- great-great-grandson, Edward Sisson, is currently writing a historical novel focusing on this part of Patterson's & Pollock's lives. Namesakes Three ships in the United States Navy have been named for him. There is a Patterson Drive in New Orleans, on the west bank of the Mississippi River, close to the levee, which in all likelihood was named for Commodore Patterson because of his War of 1812 service there.

The site is a grass-covered terrace following a serpentine course across the side of a wooded escarpment overlooking the ruins of the abbey. At either end of the terrace stand two mid-18th century follies: small Palladian temples. History The Terrace is on land that was, until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, owned by Rievaulx Abbey. It was then granted to Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland and it passed from him to the George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. On the death of his son it was sold to Sir Charles Duncombe in 1687 and inherited by his nephew Thomas Duncombe in 1711. The site was created in 1758 by Thomas Duncombe III who had inherited it from his father along with the adjoining Helmsley estate (now Duncombe Park) some ten years previously. His desire was to complement, and perhaps even surpass, the more formal terrace and temples laid out in about 1730 by his father at Duncombe Park house a mile away. It is thought that he may have planned to join the two terraces by a scenic drive along the River Rye. Two temples are on the site. At the south-east end of the terrace is the domed Doric or Tuscan Temple, thought to be a scaled-down version of the mausoleum at Castle Howard a few miles away. The pavement floor came from the choir of Rievaulx Abbey. At the opposite end stands the Ionic Temple, inspired by the Temple of Fortuna Virilis in Rome. It was intended as a banqueting house and the central table is still set as if for a meal. It is decorated with elaborate ceiling paintings and is furnished in the period style. The basement housed the kitchen and living quarters and nowadays it holds an exhibition on English landscape design in the 18th century. Duncombe's descendant, the third and last Earl of Feversham, died in 1963. In 1972 the site and the adjoining woods were purchased by the National Trust.

The story takes place in a fictional universe in which an annual series of 3-on-3 or 4-on-4 fighting tournaments are held. The first game in the series introduces the initial main character of the series, Kyo Kusanagi, a young Japanese fighter who is the heir to a powerful group of martial artists having pyrokinetic abilities. Kyo fights against the Kusanagi clan's enemies, his rival Iori Yagami, and the god Orochi and its human followers, among others. The first four games in the series revolve about these fights, while The King of Fighters '99 introduces a new story arc, revolving around K‚Ä≤, a young man who seeks to destroy the mysterious NESTS organization because they kidnapped him at an early age and stripped him of his past memories, so that they could force him to be a fighter under their control. In The King of Fighters 2003, a new character named Ash Crimson enters the tournament, to steal the powers of the clans who sealed the Orochi in the past for unknown reasons. A new group of antagonists, known as Those From the Past, also appears in the series; they want to obtain Orochi's power for the purpose of giving it to their unknown master. The plot and the characters came from the Yamata no Orochi legend. There are also several characters in the games that are parodies or homages. Merchandise based on the characters has also been released, including action figures and keychains. The characters have garnered praise from several video game publications for the quality of their designs and movesets. Comments focused on the lack of improvements in some of the characters, but added that the roster is greatly diverse. Cast creation and influences The developers of the series claim that their prototype version for King of Fighters was going to be a side- scrolling beat 'em up titled Survivor. It would have used only core characters from the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury series, specifically allowing players to play Robert Garcia and Terry Bogard for location testing. However, the idea was quickly abandoned. Since the developers were attached to the idea of the two series cross-over, they eventually agreed to make their idea into a fighting game. Characters from the Ikari Warriors and Psycho Soldier games were also added in the spirit of other gaming genres considered for their final product. The concept of a three-man team was one of the ideas kept from the side-scrolling version. Flagship director Toyohisa Tanabe asserts that the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury fighters were added specifically for adults. The newer King of Fighters characters were aimed to appeal to younger and newer audiences. He adds that every original character for the series was added based on the developers' strong desire to make one. For example, he agreed to include characters such as Benimaru Nikaido and Chang Koehan to add an off-beat variety to the cast, which he had previously deemed to be too serious. Later in the series, their approach to creating their characters altered slightly, to also serve as a type of fan service, which he refers to as a collaborative effort between fans and the staff. Several characters that appear in the series are parodies or homages to either anime, manga, actors, films or television shows that held the creators' interest. Noticeable examples are K9999 and Zero. Characters are sometimes added at the voice actors' convenience, or to fill in gaps that occur for each installment's story; this happens with Duck King in The King of Fighters XI and Ryuji Yamazaki in The King of Fighters '97. Several characters were added to the roster by Eolith's desire when this company sponsored SNK, to attract fans from Eolith's region. When designing characters for the first King of Fighters game, developers wanted a new, \\"snazzy\\" hero who would easily fight against Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting characters. Initially, this character was called Syo Kirishima, but late in the production, his name was changed to Kyo Kusanagi. This was done in order to relate him with the Yamata no Orochi legend, which was used as the inspiration for the first arc (and specifically featured a majestic sword known as Kusanagi no Tsurugi). To continue with the idea of the Orochi plot, the designers gave several other characters, such as Kyo's rival Iori Yagami, similar characteristics to Kyo. In The King of Fighters '99, to contrast the previous protagonist of the series, K' was made to be the \\"dark hero\\". K's introduction to the series was meant to remove popular characters Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami from the roster, though this idea was scrapped in the game's release. Due to the large additions of teenager characters in the series, SNK decided to add several middle-age ones to balance them. Original characters=American Sports Team : (Heavy D!) : (Lucky) : The American Sports Team, also known as the U.S.A. Team, is composed of characters originating from the United States of America. First appearing in The King of Fighters '94, the team consists of Heavy D!, a famous boxer who was expelled after seriously injuring an opponent during a match, Lucky Glauber, a former basketball player and a karate champion, and Brian Battler, the MVP football player of the year but known for his brash and violent behavior in the sport. Despite not winning the '94 tournament, in their non-canonical ending, Brian returns to football for his fans while Lucky and Heavy D! will continue street fighting and promise Brian to contact him for further competitions. Unfortunately, a running gag in the series is that the American Sports Team have always been invited to participate in the later tournaments, only to get beaten up and have their own invitations being stolen by other teams prior to the start of each tournament. The team itself would make their return in The King of Fighters '98, though it is not canonical in the series but instead a ‚Äúdream match‚Äù as it features every character up to that point in the canon story-line. Since then, the American Sports Team have made non-playable appearances in later games of the series as background characters and in other games. However, in the PlayStation 2 version of The King of Fighters 2000, the American Sports Team appear as optional strikers for the Fatal Fury Team with Heavy D! being a striker for Joe, Lucky for Andy, and Brian for Terry. Antonov : ' is a Russian billionaire and the president of his own company, the Antonov Corporation. After being reinvigorated for his love of fighting, he purchases the rights to the King of Fighters brand despite objections from the board members of his company, and announces a new King of Fighters tournament. Proclaiming himself as the ‚Äúfirst champion‚Äù, he sends out invitations across the world, challenging old and new teams to take his \\"KOF\\" championship belt away from him. Ash CrimsonChina Team : (Shun'ei) : (Tung Fu Rue) : (Meitenkun) The China Team, which is unrelated to the China Team that appeared in The King of Fighters '94, is composed of characters originating from China. First appearing in The King of Fighters XIV, the team consists of Shun'ei, a fighter who wields hydrokinesis in a form of a claw on his right side of his body and pyrokinesis in a form of a fist on his left side of his body, Tung Fu Rue, the legendary master of Hakkyokuseiken who had debuted in Fatal Fury, and Meitenkun, a young fighter who is always holding a pillow and is very sleepy. Despite having little knowledge of the King of Fighters, Tung convinces Shun and Meitenkun to enter the tournament as a means for them to face off against renowned martial artists from around the world. In addition, Tung saw the tournament as an opportunity to reunite with the Bogard brothers and meet Kyo Kusanagi, the latter after his father Saisyu requested the Japan Team to help Tung's students with their training. During the tournament finals, Shun learns that he possesses a fragment of Verse's power, which causes Verse to go after Shun. After Verse is defeated, the team returns to the Wudang Mountains where Shun tells his teammates that Kyo advised him to continue his training to keep his powers under control to which Shun vows to train harder. Chizuru Kagura : ' is a member of the Yata clan who holds one of the three sacred artifacts, the Yata Mirror, that originally sealed the serpent monster Orochi eighteen hundred years ago. As the younger heiress of the Yata clan, the other being her older twin sister Maki Kagura, Chizuru was raised as a priestess who maintains the duty of keeping the diligent seal on Orochi intact. One night, Goenitz visited their home and destroyed the seal after killing Maki since the Yata Mirror cannot fight Orochi nor Goenitz's strength alone without the aid of the other two clans. Though in a weaken state, Orochi was released from its seal and Goenitz leaves satisfy. Before her death, Maki passes on the responsibilities of the seal to Chizuru, begging her to bring the three clans together to defeat Orochi. Ten years afterwards, Chizuru becomes a very successful and prestigious businesswoman and the owner of Kagura Enterprises. During this time, she secretly kept track with the King of Fighters tournaments since it began with Geese Howard and comes up with an idea to bringing the clans together. First appearing in The King of Fighters '96, Chizuru hosts the tournament with the goal of bringing together the three clans by entreating Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami to help her replace the broken seal. During the finals of the tournament however, Goenitz appears to finally end all three heirs at once but is defeated by Kyo, with the assistance of Iori and Chizuru. Humiliated, Goenitz takes his own life by cutting his body by his own wind. In the aftermath, both Kyo and Iori protests into working together and leave Chizuru. In The King of Fighters '97, Chizuru hosts the tournament again but this time, requests to join the Women Team with Mai Shiranui and King, which they agree. During the finals of the tournament, Chizuru abandons her teammates and joins up with Kyo and Iori where they confront the remaining Orochi servants: Yashiro Nanakase, Shermie, and Chris. After defeating them, Orochi possesses Chris' body and attempts to destroy the three clans at once. The ‚ÄúSacred Treasures Team‚Äù then successfully defeats him and in a last-ditch effort, Orochi causes Iori to enter the Riot of Blood, expecting him to turn on Kyo and Chizuru. Instead, Iori snares Orochi by the neck, and Kyo obliges his rival by crippling the great demon with one last deathblow, allowing Chizuru to reseal Orochi again. In The King of Fighters 2003, Chizuru hosts another tournament with her intentions similar to her previous attempt in 1996 but during the tournament, she becomes mind-control by a member of Those From the Past. She creates an illusion of her sister Maki and creates a clone from Kyo named Kusanagi to test the strength of the tournament's contestants. Eventually, she breaks free from her mind-control, catches up with Kyo and Iori, and tries to restore the seal of Orochi. However, Ash Crimson seriously attacks her from behind and steals the Yata Mirror from her body before evading Kyo and Iori. While she doesn't appear in The King of Fighters XI, Chizuru asks Shingo Yabuki to enter the tournament with Kyo and Iori to investigate Ash and the weakened Orochi seal as she cannot due to still recovering from her injuries. Unfortunately, the investigation ends with Iori, while in the Riot of the Blood state, nearly killing Kyo and Shingo, and Ash stealing the Yasakani no Magatama from Iori's body and his flames. In the conclusion of The King of Fighters XIII, after Evil Ash erases himself and his ancestor Saiki from existence, both Iori and Chizuru regain their sacred treasures. After Verse is defeated in The King of Fighters XIV, Chizuru senses Orochi's presence in Hungary. After contacting Kyo and Iori, the trio find a still awakening Orochi in Aggtelek Karst and seal Orochi once again. In the 2010 live-action film adaptation of The King of Fighters, Chizuru is portrayed by Chinese-Canadian actress Fran√ßoise Yip. Duo Lon : Duo Lon (; Pinyin: Du√≤l√≥ng; Japanese: „Éá„É•„Ç™„É≠„É≥ Dyuoron) makes his first appearance in The King of Fighters 2003 as a member of the game's Hero Team. His overall look was based on anime title character Vampire Hunter D. He is a member of the assassin group, the Flying Brigands‚Äîor ‚Äîand the half- brother of Xiao Lon. He is an acquaintance of Ash Crimson and Shen Woo. Hoping to hunt down the clan's traitor, Ron, he agrees to enter the tournament with them. However, after discovering Ash's true objectives, he teams up with Elisabeth Blanctorche and Benimaru Nikaido. Information on Duo Lon's design graph revealed he is one of the nine children of Ron, an assassin who chased after his own father. Elisabeth Blanctorche : (spelled \\"Elisabeth Branctorche\\" in The King of Fighters XII) is one of three original characters debuting in The King of Fighters XI. Her initial character concept was to be the rival to Ash, though developers decided to change her into a \\"leading lady\\" character. The developers also describe her fighting style as \\"orthodox with subtle tricks [to it]\\" despite her minimal moveset. She initially invites Benimaru Nikaido and Duo Lon to France to form the Rival Team. She eventually reveals her acquaintance with Ash Crimson, whom she scolds for seeming to forsake their mission. Elisabeth did not appear in the arcade version of The King of Fighters XII, but was added as one of two characters exclusive to the home release of the game. Like the rest of the cast, she does not have a team for The King of Fighters XII (though the two other members of her team from King of Fighters XI are present in the game). For The King of Fighters XIII, she now appears on a team with Ash's former team members from the 2003 tournament (Shen Woo and Duo Lon), effectively forming what seems to be the new Hero Team. Though she does not participate in The King of Fighters XIV, she enlists Kukri's help in finding Ash, as his body can be seen lying on the ground in Ukraine's Carpathian Mountains, with his soul burning around it, indicating that Ash is alive once again, much to Elisabeth's rejoice. Iori YagamiJapan Team : (Kyo) : (Benimaru) : (Daimon) : (Shingo) The Japan Team, also known as the Kyo Team, is composed of characters originating from Japan. First appearing in The King of Fighters '94, the original team consisted of Kyo Kusanagi (ËçâËñô ‰∫¨), a high school student who is the heir to the Kusanagi clan wielding pyrokinetic abilities, Benimaru Nikaido (‰∫åÈöéÂ†Ç Á¥Ö‰∏∏ Nikaid≈ç Benimaru?), a professional fighter and model who can create electricity, and Goro Daimon (Â§ßÈñÄ ‰∫îÈÉé Daimon Gor≈ç), a former gold medalist in Judo and mentor to his own dojo. During the Orochi saga, the Japan Team emerged victorious in the first four tournaments. In the climax of The King of Fighters '97, Kyo, along with his rival Iori Yagami, and Chizuru Kagura, seal away Orochi, saving mankind from destruction. After the fight however, Kyo was kidnapped by a mysterious cartel while Benimaru resumed his modeling career and went on a world tour, and Goro retires from being a fighter and returns to the Judo circuit representing Japan. Also in ‚Äô97, Shingo Yabuki (Áü¢Âêπ ÁúüÂêæ Yabuki Shingo?), a high school student who idolizes Kyo and dreams of being able to wield flames, becomes a friend of the team and appears as an edit entry character. During the NESTS saga which began in The King of Fighters '99, Benimaru and Shingo are invited to participate in the tournament but were assigned to a ‚Äúspecial team‚Äù with newcomers K' and Maxima. Winning the tournament, they learned that NESTS was responsible for Kyo's disappearance, and escaped the crumbling base after a brief reunion with Kyo and being separated from K' and Maxima. In The King of Fighters 2000, Benimaru forms his own team, the \\"Benimaru Team\\" with Shingo, and two newcomers: Seth, an old friend of Benimaru and a mercenary, and Lin, a Hizoku clan assassin seeking to find a man named Ron. Following Southtown's destruction from the Zero Cannon, Ron confronted the Benimaru Team but escaped after Benimaru saves Lin from being killed. In The King of Fighters 2001, Kyo reunites with his friends, and as the Japan Team (with Shingo being the fourth member) enter the tournament to battle against NESTS, but also relive their time together as a team. After the tournament was over following NEST's destruction, the Japan team went their separate ways. In The King of Fighters 2003, Benimaru, Goro, and Shingo enters the tournament as the Benimaru Team while Kyo, Iori, and Chizuru enter as the Sacred Treasures Team to investigate suspicious activities concerning the Orochi. Later, Kyo's team is ambushed by Ash Crimson, who steals the power of the Yata Mirror from Chizuru and vows to steals the powers from both Iori and Kyo. In The King of Fighters XI, Kyo, Iori, and Shingo enter the tournament together at the convalescent Chizuru's behest (Shingo's presence serving ostensibly to keep Kyo and Iori from being at each other's throats) to stop Ash as the '\\"Kusanagi & Yagami Team\\". Meanwhile, Benimaru and Duo Lon, a teammate of Ash's team from the previous tournament, are invited by Elisabeth Blanctorche to enter the tournament as the Rival Team to track down Ash. Near the end of the tournament, the growing presence of the Orochi from Magaki causes Iori to snap and enter into the Riot of the Blood state, nearly killing Kyo and Shingo. Ash appears thereafter and steals the Yasakani no Magatama within Iori's body, along with his flames and escapes after a brief confrontation with the Rival team. In The King of Fighters XIII, Kyo, Benimaru, and Goro enter the tournament to relive their old days as the Japan team. Following the tournament, Iori regains Yasakani no Magatama and his flames, and fights Kyo to an unknown outcome. In The King of Fighters XIV, Saisyu Kusanagi (Kyo's father) informs Kyo of a new threat which will cause untold chaos. On his father's suggestion, he convenes with Tung Fu Rue and Nakoruru to investigate, while entering the tournament with Benimaru and Goro as the Japan Team. After winning the tournament, Kyo advises Shun'ei to keep training to control his powers. At the airport, he tells his teammates to go home without him and travels to Hungary. In Hungary, Chizuru had called him there for his assistance after Iori found a weakened Orochi and seal it together once again. In the spinoff series The King of Fighters EX, there are two additional members of the Japan Team: Moe Habana (ËëâËä± Ëêå, Habana Moe), an Asian American high school girl from the United States who is one of the ten treasures of Japan with her treasure being the \\"Yatsuka Sword\\" (ÂÖ´Êè° Ââ£, Yatsuka no Tsurugi ), and Reiji Oogami (Â§ßÁ•û Èõ∂ÂÖê, Ohgami Reiji), a Japanese man from Japan who is a member of the Yata clan, and one of the keepers of the ten treasures, the \\"Hetsu Mirror\\" (Ëæ∫Ê¥• Èè°, Hetsu Kagami). K‚Ä≤Kim Team The Kim Team, also known as the Korea Justice Team, and originally the Korea Team, is composed of characters mostly originating from South Korea and are mostly taekwondo practitioners. First appearing in The King of Fighters '94, the original team consisted of Kim Kaphwan (who had debuted in Fatal Fury 2), a national hero in his homeland of Korea who convince authorities to take in two criminals as part of his new \\"Rehabilitation Project\\" with the goal of rehabilitating them of their criminal ways. These two criminals are Chang Koehan (Korean: Chang Keo-Han, Japanese: Chan K≈çhan), a giant and violent man who uses an iron ball and chain and Choi Bounge (Korean: Choi Beon-Gae, Japanese: Choi Bonge), a sadistic little man who uses Freddy Krueger-esque claws. During the Orochi saga, Chang and Choi would become friends and would always attempt at a chance to escape from Kim's grasp during the end of each tournament but fail due to speaking out loud their scheme near Kim. During the NESTS saga, Jhun Hoon (Korean: Jeon Hoon, Japanese: Jon F≈´n), a childhood friend of Kim and rival, took noticed of Kim's rehabilitation project and after seeing the ethics and methods of training towards Chang and Choi, he decides that he would show Kim a more efficient way of management for the criminals and joins the team as the fourth member for the '99 and 2000 tournaments. In The King of Fighters 2001, the team was set to enter the tournament as usual. However, before the tournament started, Jhun broke his right arm while chasing an image of Athena Asamiya, of whom he is a fan of. Down one member, Kim decides to have May Lee, a perky teenager and a student of Kim who have always admired the team, replace Jhun as the fourth member with the task of keeping an eye of Chang and Choi during the tournament. During the tournament, May Lee surprised the audience and her teammates with her unique taekwondo style and gains much praise. When the tournament ended, the team return home and are celebrated as heroes for ending NESTS (despite not actually winning the tournament nor defeating NESTS themselves). In The King of Fighters 2003, Choi is requested by Jhun to sit out of that year's tournament to watch over Kim's children, allowing Jhun to take his place with the scheme of showing the world the difference in ability between him and Kim due to the tournament's new ‚Äúfree tag-off Multi-Shift rule.‚Äù In The King of Fighters XI, Chang and Choi convince Kim to join the Real Bout Fatal Fury Team with Terry Bogard and Duck King as they want Kim to enjoy himself for once after Kim believes that Chang and Choi are finally ‚Äúrehabilitated.‚Äù Following the tournament, Chang and Choi realize that Kim will be on the look out for more criminals to help rehabilitate. Despite being deem ‚Äúrehabilitated‚Äù, Chang and Choi are still in Kim's custody. In The King of Fighters XIII, Kim summons Raiden, a famous heel professional wrestler and Hwa Jai, a former Muay Thai champion who was defeated and lost his title to Joe Higashi in the past, to Southtown after he believes that they are still employed by Geese Howard, and takes them in as his new students. However, unknown to Kim, Raiden and Hwa has since cut their ties with Geese and have already reform for quite some time. Instead, they trick Kim into thinking that they are still working for Geese and enter the tournament with him as a way help boost their reputations as fighters. Once the tournament ended, Hwa and Raiden pretend to have been \\"reformed\\" by Kim, and the gullible Kim falls for it. After parting ways with his new teammates, Kim thinks he might have been \\"too soft\\" on Chang and Choi, and to honor his new teammates and the struggles they went through, he intensifies Chang and Choi's strict training much to duo's displeasure. In The King of Fighters XIV, Chang and Choi are sent to prison after destroying a bar while intoxicated. Upon arrival, the criminals encounter Xanadu, a mysterious, enigmatic, infamous and dangerous criminal who through his eccentric yet mesmerizing charisma, reverts Chang and Choi back to their old criminal ways. Upon the announcement of the new tournament, the trio enter as the Villains Team with the goal of causing chaos and destruction. Meanwhile, Kim has not heard from Chang or Choi and is unaware of their imprisonment. Deciding to go look for them, Kim was about leave the dojo when Gang-Il, Kim's master and chairman of the World Taekwondo Federation, and Luong, a seductive woman who fell in love with Gang-II during his world tour, appear at the dojo's entrance. Though Gang-II and Luong are excited to meet Kim, Kim's bitter memories of his master distracts him from their conversation until Gang-II shows Kim a leaflet, revealing that Chang and Choi are entering the new tournament with a criminal. As Kim decides to enter the tournament to retrieve Chang and Choi from the criminal's control, Gang-II and Luong also decides to enter alongside Kim in the tournament, despite Kim's objections. Originally, SNK wanted '94 to have a Prisoner Team, formed by Chang Koehan, Choi Bounge, and a third prisoner, but due to various circumstances, they added in Kim instead and made it the Korea Team. Xanadu was created for XIV to fulfilled this concept. Also, during the development for 2001, May Lee's character design stems from sponsor Eolith's desire for a \\"Korean Athena Asamiya\\" that was an \\"idol-like visual fighter.\\" Kula DiamondLin : Lin (; Pinyin: L√≠n; Japanese: È∫ü Rin) is one of the new characters introduced in The King of Fighters 2000 as a member of the Benimaru Team. He, along with the Flying Brigands subplot, was created without the entire staff's knowledge, leading to some developers being surprised by his team's ending. Though he is no longer an active member in King of Fighters, his story and character have not been abandoned. He is a member of the assassination group, The Flying Brigands‚Äîor Clan in Japanese‚Äîwhich is apparently on the brink of ruin. The agent Seth entices him to enter the King of Fighters tournament in order to find their clan's missing leader, Ron. After learning that Ron had defected to NESTS for his personal greed, Lin tracks the activities of NESTS' renegades, K‚Ä≤ and his teammates, in hopes of finding his traitorous leader. He joins up with K', Maxima, and Whip in the 2001 tournament. He continues to search for Ron even after NESTS' destruction. For an unexplained reason, he appears next to Ron in the Psycho Soldier Team's ending in The King of Fighters XI. He is a master of the Poison Hand technique, which enables the user to turn their own blood into venom. Malin : is a character who debuts in The King of Fighters 2003 as a member of the High School Girls Team (alongside Athena Asamiya and Hinako Shijou). Her addition to the series was due to Choi's absence in the game where she debuted. The game producers state that her name should be spelled \\"Malin\\" and not \\"Marin\\", adding that \\"this is the humble preference of the supervising designer and a mystery to us all\\". She becomes a member of the Anti-Kyokugenryu Team in The King of Fighters XI due to her animosity towards one of the style's practitioners, Yuri Sakazaki. Maxima : debuts as a member of the Hero Team in The King of Fighters '99. He was added to the cast with the desire to add a \\"somber and reliable middle-aged character\\" to counteract the introduction of multiple teenage characters. Both he and his former deceased partner Rocky are inspired by two characters of the same names from the 1991 SNK beat 'em up arcade game Robo Army. Maxima was a Canadian soldier who led a normal life until he found out that his comrade-in-arms Rocky was killed in an incident involving NESTS. To avenge Rocky's death, he abandons his ordinary life. In order to infiltrate the NESTS cartel without being recognized, Maxima was transformed into a cyborg, with his strength and reaction time increased to superhuman levels, built-in weapons, and the ability to conduct instant data analysis. He also has some degree of cyberpathy. He infiltrates NESTS and is assigned to be the partner of K‚Ä≤. They both defect from the cartel after K' encounters his clone, Krizalid, and grows sickened by the organization. Since then, he has become K's steadfast companion and he is often the one who enters both of them into the following tournaments. Official Invitation Team : (Sylvie Paula Paula) : (Kukri) : (Mian) The Official Invitation Team is composed of characters that Antonov personally invited to participate in his tournament. First appearing in The King of Fighters XIV, the team consists of Sylvie Paula Paula, a remnant of NESTS who wields electromagnetic powers, Kukri, a mysterious fighter from North Africa who utilizes sand-based fighting techniques while hiding his face with a hood at all times, and Mian, a Sichuan opera dancer and fighter. Prior to the tournament, each member lives in the underground society with Mian and Sylvie often taking part in underground tournaments together. During the end of the final match, Kukri reveals that he is familiar with Verse, especially since half its power lies within Shun'ei. When the tournament ends, Kukri leaves his teammates and Antonov behind and travels to the Carpathian Mountains in the Ukraine where he finds Ash Crimson. Kukri is soon joined by Elisabeth Blanctorche, revealing that she had hired Kukri to enter the tournament to find and rescue Ash whose soul resided inside Verse. Oswald : appears in The King of Fighters XI as a member of the game's Hero Team, along with Ash Crimson and Shen Woo. An Irish professional assassin who utilizes a card-based fighting style in attacking his opponents with razor-sharp cards, he was created as an older gentleman, and is an enigma to even the creators. Developers consider his moves to be comical compared to the seriousness of his image, especially when the move \\"Joker\\" is blocked or misses. They chose to leave the result of his fight with Shen ambiguous, implying that fans would have been disappointed with the outcome. He was originally intended to be the \\"good-looking glasses\\" character for the series. It is revealed at the end of the tournament that Oswald joins Ash and Shen Woo to obtain money and drugs named Dragon Pills. Ash agrees to give information regarding the drug to Oswald, explaining that it can only be given to him if he defeats the provider's enemy, Shen Woo. Oswald would later make his return as a DLC character in The King of Fighters XIV. Ramon makes his first appearance in The King of Fighters 2000 as a member of the game's Hero Team. Ramon is the only character to speak Spanish in the game, and was created to appeal to the Latin American fanbase. He has a fighting style primarily based on lucha libre. Ramon is a famous luchador known as \\"El Diablo Amarillo\\" (The Yellow Devil), who is loved by his fans in the wrestling circle. He is approached by an agent named Vanessa, who requests in his cooperation in forming a team for The King of Fighters 2000 tournament. Since then, he has had a one-sided infatuation with Vanessa. After King of Fighters 2000, he continues to team with Vanessa at her request, often along with Seth. Saisyu Kusanagi : debuted in The King of Fighters '94 as a victim in Rugal's gallery of defeated fighters. He appears as a mid-boss in The King of Fighters '95, and becomes playable for the first time on the screen in The King of Fighters '98, although he was selectable in the console versions of The King of Fighters '95 as a secret character. He was originally meant to have died in The King of Fighters '94, but was added in at the last minute of development for The King of Fighters '95. Saisyu Kusanagi is the previous head of the Kusanagi clan, who left his family to face worthy opponents across the globe. After his defeat by Rugal, he is brainwashed by his secretary Vice to fight his son, Kyo. Upon his defeat, he regains his senses and escapes from Rugal's missile silo base. In The King of Fighters 2001, he appears before Shingo Yabuki and spends a year properly teaching him the Kusanagi fighting style. In the 2010 live-action film adaptation of The King of Fighters, Saisyu is played by Japanese actor Hiro Kanagawa. Seth : makes his first appearance in the series as a \\"Striker\\" in The King of Fighters '99 Evolution. He debuts as a playable character in The King of Fighters 2000 as a member of the Benimaru Team. He was created along with Vanessa, though Seth became the visual model for her. Developers wished to have a character with \\"the powerful image of a big, dark, middle-aged man with a Mohawk haircut\\". Seth was ordered by his superior Ling to enter the King of Fighters tournament in order to capture the Flying Brigands leader, Ron. To do this, he arranges to work with the Benimaru Team. During the tournament, he learns that Ling is really Zero in disguise, and that Ron had joined with NESTS. He continues to investigate Ron's activities as the series progresses. Shen Woo : Shen Woo is one of the members of the Hero Team in The King of Fighters 2003, along with Ash Crimson and Duo Lon. He was first conceptualized to be a \\"wild and sexy man\\". Due to his fighting style revolving around punches, designers for his fighting style had to make his attacks distinctive enough to avoid confusion with Ralf and Yashiro. As \\"Shanghai's God of War\\", he was raised in the city of Shanghai in eastern China and given that nickname for developing his own, devastating street-fighting boxing style that is best described as \\"violent\\". He soon came to be very feared, and grew to enjoy the thrill of the fight. Eventually, he came to know and befriended both the enigmatic fighter Ash Crimson and the Chinese assassin Duo Lon, with the three of them becoming the \\"Hero Team\\" for The King of Fighters 2003 tournament. At the end of The King of Fighters XI, Ash decides to pit his two teammates against each other by convincing Oswald to defeat Shen Woo for the mention of the \\"Dragon Pills\\" made by anonymous pharmacists in Shanghai, telling Oswald that they will only give the Dragon Pills to someone who could defeat their mortal enemy, that is Shen himself. As soon as he and Oswald are left to fight each other, the result is unknown, though he managed to survive the outcome. He is voiced by K≈çji Suidzu. Shen Woo is one of the many examples of a sexualized male video game character of the aggressive type. South America Team : (Nelson) : (Zarina) : (Bandeiras) The South America Team is composed of characters originating from South America. First appearing in The King of Fighters XIV, the team consists of Nelson, a boxer with a robotic prosthetic left arm after losing his arm in a terrible accident, Zarina, a Samba dancer whose fighting style resembles capoeira, and Bandeiras Hattori, an obsessed fanboy of ninjas who trained himself to become one, and the founder of the ‚ÄúBrazilian Ninja Arts Dojo.‚Äù Prior to the tournament, Nelson defeated Tizoc in a contest that left him in disgrace, and adopted a heel persona called ‚ÄúKing of Dinosaurs.‚Äù Each member had their own reason for entering the tournament. Nelson wants to seize victory in the tournament while hoping that his fianc√©e Liccia will awake from her coma, Zarina wants to win the prize money to procure land as a nesting place for her pet Coco, a toucan and its species, and Bandeiras hopes that his participation and fighting style will bring in students to his dojo. While the South America Team didn't win, they saw good fortune coming out of the tournament when Liccia awakes from her coma, Zarina convinces Antonov to help procure land for Coco after he already purchased much of the land for one of his businesses (she gleefully admits that she simply kicked him in the crotch instead for his aid), and Bandeiras travels to Japan to advertise his dojo. However, he ends up getting arrested by police for causing a scene. Before seeing Liccia in the hospital, Nelson stops by at his arm's manufacturer for a checkup, completely unaware that the scientists who gave him the cybernetic left arm were responsible for his accident, and are attempting to use him as a test subject for an unknown purpose. Vanessa : first debuts as a Striker in The King of Fighters '99 Evolution, and becomes playable in The King of Fighters 2000. Like Maxima, she was created as a middle-aged female to contrast the multiple teenage characters in the roster. Vanessa is a normal housewife who discreetly serves as a mercenary agent. Working under the orders of Commander Ling, Vanessa and fellow agent Seth are commissioned with the job of joining Ling's King of Fighters tournament to follow the footsteps of the NESTS cartel. The two agents part from one another, with Vanessa recruiting prime suspects K‚Ä≤, Maxima, and Ramon to complete their team. Her objective from then on is to observe the activities of the NESTS defectors, based on Ling's orders. In The King of Fighters XI, Vanessa enters the tournament together with Blue Mary and Ramon under orders to receive information concerning the broken Orochi seal and the mysterious members of Those From the Past. Verse : is the main antagonist and final boss in The King of Fighters XIV. An evil presence that is sensed across time and space, various fighters from the tournament join to stop him. Within his being, he traps the souls of fighters from the past tournaments such as Orochi and Ash Crimson along with Gaidel, Igniz, Krizalid, and Rugal Bernstein as well as Mizuki Rashojin. His existence was the result of Ash's doing on changing his timeline to erase himself from being Saiki's descendants and kills his ancestor, which is the reason why Nakoruru travels to the present to fix the timeline. Not only that, one of Verse's fragment is also implanted inside the young Shun'ei, leaving his parents to abandon him secretly due to this, but was rescued by Tung Fu Rue and raised him as his last disciple. The Bernstein family= Rugal Bernstein  Adelheid and Rose  : : (Adel for short), along with his younger sister, , are the only known children of Rugal Bernstein. They reside in an airship called \\"Sky Noah\\". Adel is a boss character from The King of Fighters 2003, as well as a secret and mid-boss for The King of Fighters XI. They were added to the series to create an alternate story to the main plot. Despite sharing several physical and fighting traits with Rugal, Adelheid is an honorable fighter who exhibits good sportsmanship, even having a friendly conversation with Heidern, Rugal's mortal enemy. Rose, however, was developed to be extremely prideful and selfish, possessing her father's negative traits. In the end of The King of Fighters XI, Rose is manipulated by a member from the mysterious organization Those From the Past to use her in their plans, leading to the events of The King of Fighters XIII and Adelheid calls Heidern for a help to rescue his sister from the organization who brainwashed her. Hakkesshu Several members from Hakkeshu. Clockwise from top: Goenitz, Chris, Yashiro Nanakase (center), Vice, Mature and Shermie. The Hakkesshu ( in the Japanese version) are a group formed by the eight most powerful followers of the god Orochi. The four top members are referred to as \\"Kings\\". Gaidel, the biological father of Leona, was also a member of the group, but when he refused Goenitz's offer to continue the Orochi's will, Goenitz manipulated Leona into killing Gaidel and the rest of her fellow villagers. The criminal Ryuji Yamazaki is part of the group, but does not want to get involved with them.  Vice & Mature  : : and appear as members of Iori's Team in The King of Fighters '96. The designers at the time created both Vice and Mature with the image of a \\"cruel woman\\" and a \\"ruthless woman\\", respectively. Their origin story is mostly based on the notion of Rugal employing secretaries prior to The King of Fighters '96. Both women were unavailable during location testing and were likely finished near the end of the game's production schedule. Aside from serving Rugal, both women were also spies and wielders of Orochi. They are ordered by their superior Goenitz to keep an eye on Iori, but both of them are killed by Iori. Since then, both have appeared in the \\"dream match\\" games The King of Fighters '98 and The King of Fighters 2002 (games in the King of Fighters series with no canonical connection). Vice has also appeared in Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 and the sequel. Mature is a playable character in The King of Fighters XII, exclusive to the home console version of game. With Vice's return in The King of Fighters XIII, Iori's 1996 team is reunited for the first time since The King of Fighters 2002. In The King of Fighters XIII, both women are spirits, reflecting their fates at the end of the 1996 tournament. With the rise of a new Orochi crisis brought on by Ash Crimson's meddling, they convince Iori to enter the new tournament to settle matters and stop whatever it is Ash has in mind. In the 2010 live-action film adaptation of The King of Fighters movie, Vice is played by Bernice Liu, and Mature by Monique Ganderton.  Goenitz  : is one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Orochi, with the power to command the element of wind. Goenitz has a very polite personality which is reflected in his winning poses and his elegant, somewhat flowery speech. Even though influenced by Orochi, he sports the same messianistic attitude that aspires to bring about \\"salvation\\" expected from people of religious occupations. During the 1996 tournament, Goenitz discovers that Chizuru Kagura plans to gather warriors to seal the Orochi and heads there to stop her. Also, Goenitz is the one who took Rugal's eye which in turn Rugal took Heidern's eye. Depending on the playable characters, Goenitz can be killed by Iori Yagami and Kyo Kusanagi, sealed by Chizuru, or commits suicide at the end of KOF '96.  New Faces Team / Orochi Team  : (Chris) : (Shermie) : (Yashiro) The New Faces Team is a group from The King of Fighters '97. They are three of the Four Heavenly Kings of Orochi. The group is composed of a young Swedish boy named , a beautiful but shady Frenchwoman named and a tall Japanese guitar player named . They initially enter due to Yashiro's grudge against Iori and his own band (which had overshadowed a performance of theirs before the tournament), but as the tournament progresses, the Orochi blood inside their bodies soon awakens, causing them to remember their status as three of the Four Heavenly Kings. As loyal members of Orochi, they continue to gather power for the awakening until they are forced to kill themselves in order to resurrect Orochi through Chris' body, a concept that began early in the game's production. Using the Orochi power, they are stated as the Japan Team's counterparts, since they have their same abilities: Chris is able create flames like Kyo Kusanagi, Shermie creates lightning like Benimaru Nikaido, and Yashiro has enormous strength enough to shatter the earth like Goro Daimon. Orochi : is the final boss of The King of Fighters '97, and can be considered the main antagonist of the series as most villains serve him or wants to use his powers for their own ends. Its character origin is another interpretation of the mythical eight-headed serpent, Yamata no Orochi. In The King of Fighters series, it is a chthonic supernatural being that is the will of Gaia. It has no distinct gender. It does not regard humanity as trustworthy with regard to coexisting with the planet without ravaging it, and so seeks to extinguish humanity. It was sealed 1,800 years ago by the three sacred treasures of Japan. The three clans' descendants are charged with protecting the seal. In The King of Fighters '97, it incarnates in Chris (a herald of Orochi) to save the Gaia. It is sealed again at the end of the '97 tournament by the three descendants of the users of the three sacred treasures (Kyo, Chizuru and Iori), but the seal is broken (though not to the point of actually releasing it) in later games by the demon Mukai. A clone of Orochi appears as a boss in NeoGeo Battle Coliseum named Mizuchi. In King of Fighters XIV, Orochi is one of the many souls inside Verse as shown through Verse's win quote against Kyo and in the ending of Team Yagami, as it lands in Aggtelek- Karst in Hungary, before being sealed away again due to being in still weakened state. The NESTS cartel NESTS is a mysterious and dangerous cartel that deals with drugs, weaponry, robotics, genetics and biotechnology. The global crime syndicate was involved in the events behind the King of Fighters tournaments held between 1999 and 2001. They are responsible for the creation of the Kyo Kusanagi clones and K‚Ä≤. The group is composed of several agents who have different aims, but they all want to become more powerful. The cartel is destroyed with the death of their leader Igniz.  Krizalid  : acts as the mid and final boss of The King of Fighters '99. He was designed to be a stylish and earnestly strong boss, though the supervising designer at the time admits, \\"I think I overdid it a little.\\" He is made to be the ultimate Kyo clone, outfitted with a special suit to feed the data of fighters into his body during battle. He also happens to be a clone of K‚Ä≤. As a side effect, he gained some of K's memories and believed that Whip was his sister. He is ordered to activate the thousands of Kyo clones around the world so that they can attack in a simultaneous strike. After his defeat against K', his superior, Zero, neutralizes the Kyo clones and kills Krizalid by throwing a boulder to crush him. He is cloned later by the original Zero and fights alongside him in the 2001 tournament. In The King of Fighters XIV he is one of the souls inside Verse.  Ron  : Ron (; Pinyin: L√≥ng; Japanese: Èæç(„É≠„É≥) Ron) is first introduced as a sub-plot character in The King of Fighters 2000. He later appears as a Striker for Zero in The King of Fighters 2001. Though he is not playable in the series, he serves as an important side-story character. According to his official profile, his main objective is to gain the ability to manipulate the dead. He is the former leader to an elite assassination group known as the Flying Brigands‚Äî Clan in Japanese‚Äîand the father to a number of their members, including Duo Lon and Xiao Lon. He betrayed the Flying Brigands by joining NESTS for personal gain, labeling himself as a traitor by many of the group's members, including Lin, his former pupil. After NESTS' destruction, he reveals his great interest in a mysterious power shared by Sie Kensou and Bao known as the Dragon Spirit.  Zero  : : : is one of the higher-ranked agents of NESTS. The designer, C.A.C. Yamasaki, admits basing Zero off a certain character from the manga Fist of the North Star. Zero begins to secretly build his own weapon from NESTS' technology called the \\"Zero Cannon\\". He sets his plans into motion in The King of Fighters 2000. There, he impersonates a military commander named Ling and uses his persona as a decoy to stop the military resistance against him. Depending on whether or not the player defeats Kula, his plans are foiled by either Heidern or Kula, who is sent to execute him for his treacherous acts. However, the Zero in The King of Fighters 2000 is revealed to be a clone from the , who appears as a sub-boss in The King of Fighters 2001. He was created because the supervising designer of his character claimed to be dissatisfied with Zero's design in 2000. Unlike his clone, Zero is extremely loyal to the NESTS syndicate, and was disgusted to learn of his clone's attempted coup d'√©tat. Willing to clear the reputation of his clone's actions, Zero is commanded to destroy the winners of The King of Fighters tournament. He traps the winning team in a space ship that was disguised as a blimp. When he is defeated, he urges the team to escape the collapsing ship and dies honorably on board the vessel.  NESTS Team  The NESTS Team is a group that appears in The King of Fighters 2001, entering in the tournament to eliminate anybody who would try to destroy their organization. The team is composed of Kula Diamond, named the \\"Anti-K\\" due to her ability of creating ice, Kula's guardian : an expert fencer who works alongside with Kula's second guardian and another expert fencer named Diana, Angel: a ditzy yet deadly Mexican female fighter, and K9999 (pronounced K Four-Nine), a clone from Kyo entirely based on Tetsuo Shima from Akira, able to transform his arm into a long tentacle like Tetsuo's. Due to copyright issues, for The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match remake, he was replaced with a similar character. The character is called \\"Nameless\\", a clone from both Kyo and K' (whose hair, reflecting this, is half brown like that of Kyo, and half white like that of K') who uses two types of flames to fight. When their boss Zero dies from his battle upon the blimp that takes the winning team to the headquarters of NESTS, Kula and Foxy decide to leave NESTS in order to begin a new life, but the two are attacked upon sight by their teammates, who consider them traitors. K9999 and Angel mortally injure Foxy in the fight, and waste no time in attacking Kula, but when they are about to defeat her, she is rescued by K‚Ä≤, whose abilities make the attackers flee in an instant. Both K9999 and Angel haven't been heard from since. After the destruction of NESTS, Kula, Foxy, and Diana decide to work together with K‚Ä≤, Maxima, and Whip, leading to Kula joining forces with K' and Maxima in King of Fighters XI after Whip returns to the Ikari Warriors team. Angel returns in The King of Fighters XIV as part of the Mexican lucha libre team which also includes Ramon (who ironically was one of the agents seeking to shut down NESTS) and Tizoc (now fighting under the persona \\"King of Dinosaurs\\"), and Antonov hires a new fighter, , a \\"cute-looking psycho\\" who was an agent of the now-defunct NESTS cartel who can freely manipulate electricity, who in actuality is a failed NESTS experiment that considers the voice in her head and her eyeball decorations to be her \\"friends\\".  Igniz  : is the final boss in The King of Fighters 2001. His handsome and youthful appearance was specifically created at the sponsors' request. Igniz became the leader of NESTS after he killed his father years ago. After the events of the '99 and 2000 tournaments, Igniz decides to host the King of Fighters 2001 tournament in hopes of becoming a new god, deciding to test his newly acquired power against the finalists. His hopes are short-lived, however, as he is defeated by the K' Team. Cursing his failure and declaring himself a demon instead, Igniz attempts to destroy the planet by plummeting NESTS' main headquarters out of orbit; his attempt fails, and Igniz dies in the process. In King of Fighters XIV, Igniz is one of the souls inside Verse. Those From The Past are a new group of antagonists that appear in the 2003 tournament. They are mysterious, and supposedly inhuman, warriors who want to get the power of the Orochi so that they can give it to their shrouded master. It is implied that they are the European counterparts of the Orochi Clan. The organization is destroyed after Saiki's death by Ash in The King of Fighters XIII, but their actions triggered the birth of Verse.  Mukai  :https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/video-games/The-King-of-Fighters-2003/ is the hidden final boss in The King of Fighters 2003. His appearance was designed with the concept of petrification in mind. Mukai's primary power is his control over many things related to stone. He can form stone, either in crude rocks to throw at foes, or as elaborate pillars to crush them. He speaks in very pious, grandiose declarations, but appears to have a cautious attitude toward the potential of humans. He makes a prompt appearance in The King of Fighters 2003 tournament seeking strong opponents and to test his strength. Mukai reveals that his group had organized the 2003 King of Fighters tournament so that they could break the Orochi seal and give its power to the group's unknown leader. Mukai wanted to battle against the winning team of the tournament, seeing if they had what it takes to survive in \\"the new age\\". Mukai is defeated but manages to escape. However, in The King of Fighters XIII he is killed by Saiki after disobeying his boss.  Shion  : makes his first appearance in The King of Fighters XI as the sub-boss. The character was conceptually designed to be one of Ron's daughters, though developers decided to change his gender to startle and appeal to fans with his androgynous appearance. Shion is an enigmatic character whose past is unknown. He works as an underling for the demon Magaki, and seems knowledgeable about the workings of Orochi. After being defeated at the ruins of the tournament finals, he is dragged through an extradimensional gate. However, after Magaki is defeated at the end of the tournament, Shion kills him and his whereabouts remain unknown. In King of Fighters XIII, as the last cutscene, the head of Shion's spear appears. The cutscene is named The Crimson Spear. It is shown that he's still alive as he appeared before Shroom and Rimelo.  Magaki  : is the new boss of The King of Fighters XI. Nothing is known about the fighter Magaki, except that he hosts The King of Fighters tournament. Like his partner Mukai, Magaki wants to awake Orochi and give Orochi's powers to his own master. He also shows even less respect for humans in general, believing them to have little-to-no potential, and being weak overall. He also seems to have very little tolerance for not getting what he wants from others. Like Mukai before him, after he was defeated he stood up, apparently unscathed, and made his exit into another realm after commenting that perhaps it was more than spirit that was needed to awaken Orochi. However, as he finally realizes the error in his plan, he is killed by Shion's spear, hurled from the dimensional rift he was escaping from.  Saiki  : is the sub-boss as well as the main antagonist of The King of Fighters XIII. He is able to control the flow of time due to a gate that can halt the timeline so long as it is open. During cutscenes in the game, he takes the appearance of a human, very similar to Ash Crimson. Before the battle with Saiki in KOF XIII, Saiki drains fellow One From the Past Mukai of his power and transforms into a red demonic being. After the battle with Saiki, Ash Crimson takes his power, seemingly killing him. This plan backfires as Ash ends up being possessed by Saiki and turns into a shadowed version of himself called Evil Ash (known by fans as Dark Ash) to act as the game's final boss. During the ending, Saiki is defeated, but tries to use the time barrier to rewind time again and try his plot once more; Ash stands in his way and prevents his passage. When the gate closes, Saiki is finally defeated, but it is learned that he is Ash's ancestor. By denying Saiki passage into the past, Ash forces his own existence being Saiki's descendant to cease, leaving his soul survived to exist without being Saiki's descendant but trapped in time and contained inside one of the two creatures Ash created from his cause known as Verse. Characters from other SNK games=Another World Team : (Nakoruru) : (Mui Mui) : (Love Heart) The Another World Team is composed of characters who appeared in other SNK games outside of The King of Fighters universe. First appearing in The King of Fighters XIV, the team consists of Nakoruru, an Ainu miko who fights alongside her pet hawk Mamahaha and is from Samurai Shodown, Mui Mui, the last successor of her clan and a master of Kung Fu from Dragon Gal, and Love Heart, the captain of the Peace Pirates from Sky Love. In her world, Nakoruru senses a terrible entity emerging after a crack in the spacetime continuum. With the source coming from another universe, Nakoruru transports herself into the present universe with the goal of preventing the disaster and finding its true source. Shortly after arriving at the present universe, Nakoruru encounters Love Heart, who was transported by the same entity unwillingly, and agrees to help investigate the phenomenon. During their investigation, the duo meets Mui Mui, who transported herself to the present universe willing in search for gems filled with mysterious powers, and joins them. Upon the announcement of the new tournament, the trio decides to enter in hopes of finding the source. During the finals, the source was revealed to be Verse. Following Verse's defeat and the end of the tournament, the team travels to Russia where Nakoruru believes that Verse may return one day, but is unsure when the entity will come back. While Love Heart and Mui Mui are ready to return to their own worlds, Nakoruru instead decides to stay in the present universe to visit modern day Hokkaido and China, inviting her teammates to travel with her. While Mui Mui agrees with the idea, unfortunately for Love Heart, she is drag along by her teammates much to her annoyance. Art of Fighting Team : (Ryo) : (Robert) : (Takuma) : (Yuri) The Art of Fighting Team, originally the Mexico Team, is composed of characters originating from the video game series with the same name, and are mostly practitioners of Kyokugenryu Karate (also known as Kyokugen), a fighting style created by the Sakazaki family. First appearing in The King of Fighters '94, the original team consisted of Ryo Sakazaki, the heir to Kyokugenryu Karate, Robert Garcia, a wealthy practitioner who is Ryo's best friend and rival, and Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo's father and the founder of Kyokugenryu Karate who trains the students at the dojo, and Ryo and Robert's master. After The King of Fighters '95, Takuma decides to retire from competing due to his age catching up with him which leads to Robert suggesting that Yuri Sakazaki, Takuma's daughter, Ryo's sister, and Robert's love interest, becomes his replacement for the next tournament. Beginning with The King of Fighters '96, Yuri becomes the third member of the team for the remainder of the Orochi Saga. During the NESTS Saga, Takuma comes out of retirement and joins the team as the fourth member in The King of Fighters '99. In The King of Fighters 2000, Yuri wanted to show her independence by joining the Women Team that year by begging King, a French Muay Thai fighter who has a history with the Sakazaki family in the past, to be her replacement. While Ryo and Takuma welcomed the idea, Robert disagreed and challenged King to a kicking contest to prove herself. Although the contest ended in a tie, Robert was impressed with King's kicking ability that he agreed to let King join the team. In The King of Fighters 2001, Robert and his father Alberto Garcia are facing a takeover in their company, the Garcia Foundation, after they and the rest of the world suffers from a financial crisis due to NESTS‚Äô increased activities after the last tournament. After pleading to the Sakazaki family to enter the tournament to win the prize money, they agreed to help Robert and his family (in reality, Takuma wanted to win the prize money for himself to help with the family's dojo). Despite not winning the 2001 tournament, the financial crisis that Robert and his father faced seem to have been resolved as by The King of Fighters 2003, Robert is joyfully wealthy again and enters the tournament with Ryo and Yuri. When the team returns home from the tournament, they found Takuma laying facedown on the dojo floor, apparently after being assaulted by an unseen assailant. Takuma tries to tell them who attacked him, but passes out, and is taken away in an ambulance. In The King of Fighters XI, it is revealed that Takuma was not attacked by an assailant but actually, he collapsed due to malnutrition, liver problems, and other health issues. He uses the incident as an excuse to fulfill his wishes for a grandchild by asking King to enter the tournament with Ryo and Yuri, and be his replacement since Robert cannot enter because of a disaster that took place at his father's company that his presence is required for the issue to be resolved. In The King of Fighters XIII, the Sakazakis get into a family argument after Yuri cuts her hair which Takuma and Ryo disapproves of. When Robert tells Yuri that her family wants her to quit her training (more so, to stop entering King of Fighters tournaments and fighting overall to prevent serious injury to herself), Yuri decides to enter the tournament with King and Mai Shiranui to show her independence once again, and to show her family how much her Kyokugen has improved. When Takuma (who has made a full recovery) finds out that Yuri is entering the tournament with another team, he, Ryo, and Robert, who now has enough free time away from his father's company, enter the tournament. When the tournament ends, the team, alongside Yuri and King, are being interviewed by the media that Robert pulls out an engagement ring while Yuri is answering questions. Takuma takes notice of the ring and Robert's intentions that he hits Robert from behind, which leads to the two men hitting each other without notice while Yuri embarrasses King by telling reporters that she wishes King becomes a part of the family. Ryo then proclaims that teamwork is the key to Kyokugen's success. In The King of Fighters XIV, the team have since opened up their own restaurant called ‚ÄúKyokugen BBQ‚Äù with the help of Richard Meyer. In addition to entering the tournament as usual to attract new students, the team plans on promoting their new restaurant. After returning home from the tournament, the team throws a private party to themselves where Ryo becomes displeased with Robert and his family's attitude regarding their training, and are more focused on improving the restaurant that he is determined to leave South Town, alongside with his student Khushnood Butt. Fatal Fury Team The \\"Fatal Fury Team\\" is composed of characters originating from the video game series with the same name. First appearing in The King of Fighters '94 as the Italy Team, the original group consisted of Terry Bogard, an American fighter who sought to defeat the evil crime lord Geese Howard in order to avenge the death of his father Jeff Bogard; Andy Bogard, the younger brother of Terry who uses the Shiranui fighting style; and Joe Higashi, a Muay Thai fighter and mutual friend of Terry and Andy. In The King of Fighters '99, Mai Shiranui, a Shiranui kunoichi, and love interest of Andy, joins the team as during this time, teams are now composed of four fighters. Blue Mary, a female agent and love interest of Terry, and decides to help her out in her job by teaming up with her in the 2000 and 2001 editions of the King of Fighters tournaments. In The King of Fighters 2003, Terry and Joe entered the tournament with Tizoc, a famous Mexican professional wrestler as Andy took care of his Shiranui disciple Hokutomaru who fell sick with the mumps. In The King of Fighters XI, Terry organize a new Fatal Fury team with Duck King and Kim Kaphwan. In The King of Fighters XIII, Terry wanted to catch up and reunite the Fatal Fury team with Andy and Joe once again. Before their meeting, he endures a long journey back to the city and fell asleep at the station. In The King of Fighters XIV, Terry, Andy, and Joe enter the tournament- Garou Team The Garou Team appears only in KOF XI, containing characters that appear in the video game Garou: Mark of the Wolves. The team includes Tizoc, a famous pro wrestler, Gato, a powerful martial artist and a female pirate named B. Jenet. Though the members become good friends, Gato decides to leave them after the end of the tournament. Geese Howard's teams The villain known as Geese Howard creates several teams in the series. In King of Fighters '95, he sends his right-hand man Billy Kane to kill his enemies, the Bogard brothers. Billy allies with Iori Yagami and Eiji Kisaragi to form a Rival Team in the tournament, but once they fail to obtain the victory, Iori brutally attacks them and nearly kills Billy and Eiji in the process. In The King of Fighters '96, Geese creates the Boss Team, including Wolfgang Krauser, Mr. Big and Geese himself. Geese uses both Krauser and Big as pawns in the tournament, hoping to get the power from the Orochi being, while Krauser only wants to prove their strength, and Mr. Big uses this opportunity to seek out a chance to usurp Geese's empire unbeknownst to him. As the group disbanded at the end of King of Fighters '96, Geese sponsors a new group known as the Outlaw Team in the '97 and 2003 tournaments for the same purpose. The team for the '97 tournament is made up of Billy Kane, Blue Mary and Ryuji Yamazaki, though Blue Mary is replaced by Gato in the 2003 tournament. Geese eventually returns to the tournament in The King of Fighters XIV, hiring his right-hand man Billy Kane and his butler Hein to join him under Billy's request. Ikari Warriors Team The Ikari Warriors Team is a group of mercenaries that enters in each tournament in the series in order to find well-known criminals and capture them. The leader established the team in order find the criminal Rugal Bernstein, in order that Heidern could get his revenge against Rugal (who killed Heidern's wife Sandra and their daughter Clara). The other two recurring members of the team are the soldiers Ralf Jones and Clark Still, who were originally the player characters in Ikari Warriors and its sequels. , Heidern's adopted daughter introduced in The King of Fighters '96, replaces him as he takes on a more active role behind the scenes, investigating occurrences parallel to the tournament. Although she tends to be very quiet, Leona was conceived to be an Orochi descendant at the time of her debut, and her designers took special care to let their interests at the time reflect in her actions. Her official nickname is The Silent Soldier. Although she recovers from her childhood trauma at the end of King of Fighters '97, she leaves the team after attacking her friends in the Riot of the Blood state at the conclusion of King of Fighters 2003 and tries to regain her focus from within her personal time. appears in The King of Fighters '99 as the new member to the Ikari Team. She is a clone of K‚Ä≤s sister and once worked for NESTS as an assassin. She is eventually assigned to Heidern's mercenary unit for The King of Fighters tournament to investigate NESTS and the mysterious fighter known only as K'. Once she realizes who K' is, she reveals their relation to him and joins him in his objective to destroy the NESTS cartel. After NESTS' downfall, she returns to her duties under Heidern's command. One of her moves depicts her shooting her opponents with a Desert Eagle-like handgun. The firearm is edited from the American release of the games in arcades, but is uncensored in the home release versions. Leona, Ralf, and Clark compose the Ikari Team for The King of Fighters XIII, reflecting the team's roster from the 1996 tournament. Despite her difficulties in controlling herself leading her to sit out the XI tournament as Whip took her place, Leona commits herself to entering the XIII tournament, deciding to accept, and deal with, her Orochi blood. Psycho Soldier Team The Psycho Soldier Team specializes in using psychic powers‚Äîdubbed \\"Psycho Powers\\" by SNK. The powers, and some members of the team, first appeared in the SNK video game Psycho Soldier. The team includes , an elderly mentor and master of Psycho Power. He participates with his students throughout the tournaments since 1994, but leaves the competition in 2003 to observe thoroughly the matter of Orochi's possible resurgence, asking K‚Ä≤ and Maxima to investigate the tournament in his place for activity, meaning both Kensou and Chin are replaced with Hinako and Malin. The others members of the team are his students Athena Asamiya, a famous Japanese pop singer; a Chinese teenager infatuated with Athena named ; and a little Chinese boy named . As Bao trains with them during the time between King of Fighters '97 and King of Fighters '99, Kensou gradually loses his powers, until they become obsolete. However, his powers are recovered in King of Fighters XI, causing Ron and Misty to take an interest in it, revealing a probable importance of the Dragon Spirit. A young girl who trained with Kensou and Athena, , also debuts in the team in The King of Fighters XI. She was added into the cast to fit the image of the younger Psycho Soldier team, though the developers have expressed discomfort with adding so young a character amongst a large group of adults. In addition, Momoko's discipline is capoeira, rather than Chinese Martial Arts like her teammates. Chin and Kensou make their latest appearances in The King of Fighters XII; in The King of Fighters XIII, the Psycho Soldier team is re- formed and represented by the original members. Women Fighters Team The Women Fighters Team is a group composed exclusively of women, christened \\"The Princesses of Punch.\\" The team originally comprises the Kyokugen karate prodigy Yuri Sakazaki, the ninja Mai Shiranui, and the Muay Thai fighter King. Throughout the later games of the series, there are several changes in the members of the team, as Yuri is sometimes called to join the Art of Fighting team, leading her to be replaced by the heir of the ancient Yata clan Chizuru Kagura and Kasumi Todoh‚Äîa young female martial artist who seeks to defeat those who practice Kyokugen karate. In later games, new characters appear, due to the new rule of using four members; these include the agent Blue Mary, the Chinese-American female martial artist Li Xiangfei and the sumo fighter . In 2003, the Women Fighters Team has a subdivision with high school girls as the members, hence the reason it is named the High School Girls Team (also known as the New Psycho Soldier Team). This team is led by Athena Asamiya, and the two other members are Hinako and Malin. In XI, the team is dissolved, since the members go to other teams or they have other things to do. The Women Fighters Team is reformed for The King of Fighters XIII, featuring the three original members from the 1994 tournament. In XIV, the team returns with Mai and King getting a new member named Alice, an avid fan of Terry Bogard who inspires to be just like him. Reception The characters from The King of Fighters series were said to be a varied cast by Eurogamer magazine, since the cast includes characters from other SNK games. IGN agreed, commenting that every character has their own unique moves and praising their visuals, even though the magazine mentioned that the characters have old two-dimensional designs. IGN criticized that learning the characters' special moves was difficult. In reviews for the first game, IGN praised the main character Kyo Kusanagi as one of the most enjoyable characters to play, remarking on his dynamism and movesets. GameSpot also praised the characters designs, saying they \\"shine through, resulting in a cast of characters that's diverse and not plentiful\\". In other reviews, they complained about the lack of improvements in the character's movesets in some games, and also mentioned that some techniques were simply removed. They noted that, while new characters introduced in some games are interesting, they do not have the same impact as other ones. 1UP.com labelled the characters from the series as one of SNK's best creations, claiming that their appearances and quotations are all \\"cool\\"‚Äîalthough they commented some of the storylines are \\"nonsense\\". The boss characters were criticized by multiple reviewers for being too difficult to defeat, with Krizalid from The King of Fighters '99 being singled out as too powerful. The character designs in Maximum Impact were praised by IGN, which noted that the conversion to three-dimensional modeling had \\"extremely vibrant\\" characters with \\"a decent amount of detail.\\" However, they disliked the lack of blood, especially during violent attacks, saying the super moves and combos were \\"just not as spectactular here\\" as they were in previous installments. IGN sharply criticized the \\"terribly bad voice acting\\", calling it \\"truly piss-poor American dub work.\\" Gamezone added that some characters still remain their unique fighting style, but complained about the lack of individualized endings, and commented that some of the attacks have less style in 3D. GameSpot also added that the English voices weren't distinctive, but commented that their new outfits were \\"pretty wild\\". The characters, however, were \\"just not done with the same pixel-perfect flair\\" as the 2D versions, they said, noting that \\"you'll recognize [the characters] because of their clothes and special moves, not because of their faces.\\" Action figures, puzzles, keychains, and pins have been produced based on the characters in the King of Fighters series. Many characters are also featured on posters, wallpapers, and trading cards.

They were soon renamed the \\"Rifle Corps\\". In January 1803, they became an established regular regiment and were titled the 95th Regiment of Foot (Rifles). In 1816, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, they were again renamed, this time as the \\"Rifle Brigade\\". The unit was distinguished by its use of green uniforms in place of the traditional redcoat as well as by being armed with the Baker rifle, which was the first British-made rifle accepted by the British Army in place of smooth-bore muskets. The 95th was the first regular infantry corps in the British Army to be so armed. They performed distinguished service in both the First and Second World Wars. Post war, in 1958 the regiment formed part of the Green Jackets Brigade as 3rd Green Jackets and was amalgamated with the 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) and the 2nd Green Jackets (King's Royal Rifle Corps) to form the Royal Green Jackets on 1 January 1966. History=Formation In 1800, an \\"Experimental Corps of Riflemen\\", was raised by Colonel Coote Manningham and Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. William Stewart, drawn from officers and other ranks from drafts of a variety of British regiments. The Corps differed in several regards from the line infantry of the British Army and most significantly were armed with the formidable Baker rifle. The rifle was remarkably accurate in an era when it was generally considered impractical for individual soldiers to aim at specific targets.Nosworthy, Brent (1997), \\"Battle tactics of Napoleon and his enemies\\", Constable Riflemen wore dark green jackets rather than the bright red coats of the British line infantry regiments of that time, close-fitting pantaloons rather than breeches, black facings and black belts rather than white and a green plume on their \\"stovepipe shakoes\\". As the Rifle Corps Four months after its formation, the Rifle Corps was judged ready for its first operation. On 25 August 1800, three companies, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel William Stewart, spearheaded a British amphibious landing at Ferrol, Spain, where the Rifles helped to dislodge the Spanish defenders on the heights. Despite this, the expedition was defeated and withdrew on 26 August 1800. In April 1801, one company of the Experimental Corps of Riflemen, under the command of Captain Sidney Beckwith, took part in the British victory at the Battle of Copenhagen, as marksmen aboard Royal Navy ships that were under the overall command of Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson. During the battle, the Rifle Corps suffered one lieutenant killed, its first officer to fall, and two other ranks killed and six wounded, some of whom died later. As the 95th Regiment In 1802, the Rifle Corps was brought into the line of the British Army as the 95th Regiment of Foot. In 1803, the 95th moved to Shorncliffe Army Camp, Kent, where it underwent light infantry training, along with the 43rd and 52nd Regiments of Foot, under the tutelage of Colonel Coote-Manningham and Sir John Moore; the latter, like the 95th, would gain fame during the Peninsular War. In 1805, a 2nd Battalion was raised at Canterbury, Kent, and later in the year the 1st/95th deployed to Germany as part of a British expedition, under the command of Lord Cathcart, designed to liberate Hanover from occupation by France. The 95th subsequently formed the advance guard on the way to Bremen. In February 1806, the 95th formed the rearguard for the withdrawal to Cuxhaven and subsequently returned home to the UK. =South American expedition= In October 1806, five companies of the 1st/95th and three companies of the 2nd/95th departed for Spanish-controlled South America, Spain then being allied with France. It was part of a second invasion force that was designed as reinforcements for the first invasion against Buenos Aires, launched earlier in 1806 by Sir Home Popham without the Government's knowledge. Saint Helena regiment flag (or 95th Rifle Regiment flag). The 2nd/95th, as part of Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Auchmuty's force, took part in the siege and subsequent storming of Montevideo, in what is now Uruguay, and which saw Montevideo captured on 3 February 1807, after clearing the surrounding area of Spanish troops in January. The 95th subsequently saw action at Colonia against a Spanish force that had crossed from Buenos Aires; the Rifles held off the force until it could be repulsed, with the 95th gaining much praise from Auchmuty for their part in the defeat of the Spanish force. The 95th subsequently saw action in June at San Pedro where they, the 40th and light companies, fought against the Spanish force that had crossed from Buenos Aires and defeated them. Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke, the newly arrived overall commander, subsequently launched an ill-advised and mismanaged assault on Buenos Aires in which the companies of both battalions of the 95th were involved as part of the Light Brigade, commanded by Robert Craufurd. During the assault on Buenos Aires on 5 July, the 95th and the rest of the British force suffered heavy casualties in bitter fighting to capture the city. The Light Brigade had suffered so heavily that they had to take refuge in a church and were surrendered soon after. Whitelocke eventually surrendered his force. After Whitelocke negotiated the withdrawal of British forces, the men were released and they returned home later that year. The 95th would go on to fight for near the entirety of the Peninsular War in Spain. In the aftermath of the disastrous expedition, Popham and Whitelocke were court- martialed, with Popham reprimanded and Whitelocke dismissed from the Army. =The Baltic 1807‚Äì1808= The remaining companies of the 95th were involved in the expedition to Denmark that year. They took part in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 as part of Arthur Wellesley's brigade. The expedition, commanded by Lord Cathcart, was intended to capture the Danish Fleet to prevent it falling into the hands of France. The expedition proved to be a thorough success with the Danish Fleet being captured at which point the British withdrew. In 1808 the 1st/95th took part in an expedition to another Scandinavian country, Sweden, an expedition that was commanded by Sir John Moore and designed to help Sweden during their war with Russia. However, once they had reached Gothenburg in May, the troops remained aboard the anchored ships for two months due to a misunderstanding between the British and Swedish governments and returned to Britain. =Peninsular War= Re-enactors depicting riflemen of the 95th In August 1808 the 2nd/95th was part of the immediate forces sent in the Portuguese expedition initially commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley and covered the landings at Mondego Bay (Figueira da Foz). On 15 August they had the distinction of firing the first shots of the Peninsular War during a skirmish at √ìbidos against the French, but also unfortunately suffered the first British officer fatality of the war, a Lieutenant Ralph Bunbury. The 95th, as part of 6th Brigade which included the rifle armed 5th/60th Foot, took part in the Battle of Roli√ßa, the first pitched battle of the war, on 17 August 1808. Rifleman Thomas Plunket of the 1st Battalion, 95th Rifles, shot the French General Auguste Fran√ßois-Marie de Colbert-Chabanais at a range of up to at the Battle of Cacabelos on 3 January 1809.The shots were at a sufficiently long distance to impress others in the 95th Rifles, whose marksmanship (with the Baker rifle) was far better than the ordinary British soldiers. However no eyewitnesses gave the range of Plunket's shot, and the descriptions of Plunket's and Colbert's positions are too vague to allow any measurement. (). The 1st battalion was part of John Moore's campaign which ended with evacuation after the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809. The majority of the 1st battalion was rested and refitted in the UK, though a few small detachments of the 95th were stranded behind which then formed up with other detachments as part of a defence force (1st Battalion of detachments) in Portugal. The 1st returned to the peninsula a few months later in May 1809 and in July was force marched in an attempt to arrive with the main force for the Battle of Talavera but despite covering a notable distance they arrived on 29 July 1809, just after the battle. After the depletion suffered at Corunna, the two battalions of the 95th based at Hythe in Kent were made up to a strength of 1,000 men each. However, so many volunteers came forward to join the regiment that permission was granted to raise a third battalion in 1809. The third battalion joined the Peninsular Army in 1810. Thereafter the three battalions of the 95th fought in numerous major battles and skirmishes during the Peninsular War as part of the elite Light Division, including the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810 and the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812 and Badajoz and March 1812 as well as the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813. At the Battle of San Marcial in August 1813 a company of the 95th Rifles under the command of Captain Daniel Cadoux held off an entire French division at Vera before withdrawing. The regiment also took part in the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813. =Waterloo campaign= Lieut. Col James Fullarton, 3rd Battalion, 95th Regiment, Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) The three battalions had been dispersed to various locations with the abdication of Napoleon and the total French defeat in 1814. The majority of the regiment's companies were sent back to England for rest and refitting while several companies had been retained in north-east France at Leuze, Aisne under General Thomas Graham. Five companies of the 3rd battalion were in North America, having been sent in late 1814 to participate in the final stages of the War of 1812. With the return of Napoleon from exile, all of the companies in England crossed the channel and landed in Belgium in May 1815, joining with those already present, so that the entire regiment, bar the five companies still in America, became part of Wellington's Anglo-Dutch army. The first battalion went on to fight at the Battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815, while all three battalions would fight at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815. As the Rifle Brigade At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the size of the British Army was reduced; in line with precedent the more recently formed regiments were disbanded first. The unique skills of the 95th were considered too valuable to lose so the 95th, having seen distinguished service in the Napoleonic Wars, was taken out of line of the British Army and became the \\"Rifle Brigade\\" on 23 February 1816 (the number was reassigned eight years later to the newly formed county regiment of the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot). The Duke of Wellington became Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment in 1820 and served until his death. =Later nineteenth century campaigns= Three members of 3rd Battalion Rifle Brigade, who had fought in the Crimean War: Private John Sitcombs, Colour Sergeant A. Holdaway and Colour Sergeant J. Johnson In 1852 HRH Prince Albert, the Prince Consort took over the role of colonel-in-chief. When the Crimean War broke out in 1853 the Rifle Brigade sent two battalions which fought at the Battle of Alma, where one of the battalions led the advance across the Alma River in September 1854. The regiment also saw action at the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 and at the Siege of Sevastopol in winter 1854. Eight members of the regiment were awarded Victoria Crosses during the Crimean War. The regiment was deployed again as part of the Indian Rebellion and saw action at the Siege of Lucknow in autumn 1857. It was granted the title \\"The Prince Consort's Own Rifle Brigade\\" in honour of its colonel-in-Chief on 17 January 1862. In 1866, Private Timothy O'Hea of the 1st Battalion, was awarded the Victoria Cross for an act of bravery in peacetime, while his unit was stationed in the Province of Canada. On 9 June 1866, at Danville, Canada East, on the main railway between Montreal and Quebec City, a fire broke out in a car containing of ammunition. Despite the extreme danger, O'Hea took charge of extinguishing the fire and saved many lives. The regiment also took part in the Battle of Ali Masjid in November 1878 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the Mahsud Waziri expedition in 1881, the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885, the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War in 1895 and the Mahdist War in 1898. The 1st and 2nd Battalions were both deployed to South Africa in 1899, at the outbreak of the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902). The 1st Battalion saw action at the Battle of Colenso in December 1899 and Battle of Vaal Krantz in February 1900. The 2nd Battalion took part in the Siege of Ladysmith in late 1899 and early 1900. Both battalions stayed in South Africa until the end of the war. 367 officers and men of the 1st battalion left Cape Town on the SS Orissa, which arrived at Southampton in late October 1902, when the battalion was stationed at Portsmouth. 990 officers and men of the 2nd battalion left Port Natal on the SS Malta in September 1902 for a new posting in Egypt. The 5th, Militia Battalion, was embodied in 1900, and served in South Africa until 700 men of the battalion returned home on the SS Avondale Castle in September 1902. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had three Reserve but no Territorial battalions.These were the 5th Battalion (Special Reserve), the 6th Battalion (Special Reserve) and the 7th (Special Reserve) =First World War= Memorial at St Luke's church in Ilford, London, in the shape of the Rifle Brigade's insignia, to Percival Gibbons who fell in the Second Battle of Ypres Regular army The 1st Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 11th Brigade in the 4th Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front.

The 8th Battalion took part in the Second Battle of Ypres, which had begun on 22 April 1915 and the action at Hooge in July 1915 where they saw the first use of flamethrowers by the Germans. Second Lieutenant Sidney Woodroffe, of the 8th Battalion, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in this battle. The battalions also saw action in the Second Battle of Ypres which had begun in April 1915 and an action near La Brique in Belgium where Corporal Alfred George Drake, also of the 8th Battalion, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 23 November 1915. The battalions then took part in the Battle of Delville Wood in September 1916, the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette in September 1916 and the advance to the Hindenburg Line as well as the Battle of Arras in April 1917, the Battle of Langemark in August 1917 and the Battle of Passchendaele in October 1917 before taking part in the Battle of St Quentin in March 1918 and the Battle of the Avre in April 1918. The 9th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 42nd Brigade in the 14th (Light) Division in May 1915 for service on the Western Front and took part in most of the same battles as the 7th and 8th battalions. Roll of fame for The Rifle Brigade on the north wall at Winchester Cathedral The 10th (Service) Battalion and 11th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 59th Brigade in the 20th (Light) Division in July 1915 for service on the Western Front.

The 1st Battalion, Rifle Brigade was in England on the outbreak of the Second World War, originally part of the 1st Support Group, part of the 1st Armoured Division. In late April 1940, however, the battalion transferred to the newly created 30th Infantry Brigade and landed in France the following month within the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) but was lost at the defence of Calais, where the brigade slowed the German advance and enabled the Dunkirk evacuation to proceed. The battalion was reformed in the United Kingdom and became part of the 2nd Armoured Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division and took part in many battles in the North African Campaign before transferring to the 22nd Armoured Brigade of the 7th Armoured Division in June 1942. Now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Stephens, the 1st Battalion's four 6-pounders were credited with destroying many tanks from the 21st Panzer Division at the Battle of Alam el Halfa on 31 August 1942. The 1st Battalion subsequently took part in the Second Battle of El Alamein and the Tunisian Campaign until May 1943 when the war in North Africa ended with the surrender of almost 250,000 German and Italian soldiers. The battalion, with the rest of the 7th Armoured Division, took part in the Allied invasion of Italy, and the early stages of the Italian Campaign, in September 1943, returning to England in January 1944 and took part in the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, going on to fight throughout the North West Europe Campaign until Victory in Europe Day in May 1945, ending the war in Hamburg, Germany, and commanded throughout by Lieutenant Colonel A. G. V. Paley. On the outbreak of war the 2nd Battalion, commanded since July 1938 by Lieutenant Colonel Edward Williams, was stationed in Palestine as part of the 14th Infantry Brigade of the 8th Infantry Division. The battalion, then commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Renton, later fought with distinction as part of the 7th Motor Brigade in the 1st Armoured Division in the Western Desert Campaign, especially in the \\"Snipe\\" action during the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942, when the four 6-pounders of the battalion, supported by a 6-pounder Anti-Tank battery of the Royal Artillery, knocked out over 50 German and Italian tanks in a lengthy battle. Lieutenant Colonel Victor Buller Turner, commanding the battalion at this time, received the Victoria Cross for his actions fighting with the guns. Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Pearson, the battalion, alongside the 1st Battalion, continued to play a prominent role in the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign. In September 1943 the battalion transferred to the 7th Armoured Brigade in the 10th Armoured Division, remaining with that formation in North Africa until May 1944, when it transferred to the 61st Lorried Infantry Brigade in the 6th Armoured Division for service in the Italian Campaign, seeing action in the Fourth and final battle of Monte Cassino, the Gothic Line and the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy, which brought an end to the war in Italy in early May 1945. The 7th Battalion was formed by re-designation of 1st Battalion the London Rifle Brigade in January 1941. The battalion became part of the 23rd Armoured Brigade, then serving under the 8th Armoured Division, and was sent with the division to Egypt in July 1942 where it played a role in the First Battle of El Alamein before, the following month, becoming a part of the 7th Motor Brigade, part of the 1st Armoured Division. It later transferred to the independent 9th Armoured Brigade and finally to the 61st Lorried Infantry Brigade and was engaged throughout the Italian Campaign from May 1944 onwards, commanded throughout by Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Darling. A Universal Carrier crew of the 8th Battalion, Rifle Brigade hands out chocolate to Dutch civilians during the advance of 11th Armoured Division in the Netherlands, 22 September 1944. The 8th Battalion, Rifle Brigade was formed in early January 1941 by the redesignation of the 2nd Battalion, London Rifle Brigade, spent most of its existence in the United Kingdom and took part in the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, as part of the 29th Armoured Brigade in the 11th Armoured Division, and saw action in the North West Europe Campaign. Men of the 9th Battalion, Rifle Brigade watch the destruction of a British supply dump at Hamra, El Alamein. The 9th Battalion was created in late May 1941 by the redesignation of the 1st Battalion, Tower Hamlet Rifles. The battalion was part of the 2nd Support Group of the 2nd Armoured Division and then the 200th Guards Brigade until June 1942. The 9th later served with the 4th Armoured Brigade in the 7th Armoured Division and took part in the Battle of Gazala in May 1942 during the North African Campaign before being disbanded in August 1942. The 10th Battalion was formed in 1941 by the redesignation of the 2nd Battalion, Tower Hamlet Rifles and transferred to the 26th Armoured Brigade of the 6th Armoured Division. The battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Adrian Gore, saw service with the division in Tunisia in late 1942 and 1943 before, in May 1944, transferring to the 61st Lorried Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Adrian Gore, serving alongside the 2nd and 7th Battalions in the Italian Campaign. However, the battalion was disbanded in late March 1945, most of the personnel being sent to the 2nd Battalion. =Post-Second World War= From spring 1946 a number of surplus Rifle Brigade subalterns were transferred to No. 1 T-Force, a British Army unit which was active in the Ruhr. Their role was to carry out reparations work, evacuating military and industrial equipment needed to rebuild British industry. The 1st Battalion went on to serve in the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya in 1954 and the Malayan Emergency in 1956. Amalgamations The 1st Battalion was renamed the 3rd Green Jackets, The Rifle Brigade in 1958 and was amalgamated with the 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) and the King's Royal Rifle Corps to form the Royal Green Jackets on 1 January 1966.

The orthogonal complement of its kernel is called the initial subspace and its range is called the final subspace. Partial isometries appear in the polar decomposition.  General  The concept of partial isometry can be defined in other equivalent ways. If U is an isometric map defined on a closed subset H1 of a Hilbert space H then we can define an extension W of U to all of H by the condition that W be zero on the orthogonal complement of H1. Thus a partial isometry is also sometimes defined as a closed partially defined isometric map. Partial isometries (and projections) can be defined in the more abstract setting of a semigroup with involution; the definition coincides with the one herein.  Operator Algebras  For operator algebras one introduces the initial and final subspaces: :\\\\mathcal{I}W:=\\\\mathcal{R}W^*W,\\\\,\\\\mathcal{F}W:=\\\\mathcal{R}WW^*  C*-Algebras  For C*-algebras one has the chain of equivalences due to the C*-property: :(W^*W)^2=W^*W\\\\iff WW^*W=W\\\\iff W^*WW^*=W^*\\\\iff(WW^*)^2=WW^* So one defines partial isometries by either of the above and declares the initial resp. final projection to be W*W resp. WW*. A pair of projections are partitioned by the equivalence relation: :P=W^*W,\\\\,Q=WW^* It plays an important role in K-theory for C*-algebras and in the Murray-von Neumann theory of projections in a von Neumann algebra.  Special Classes = Projections  Any orthogonal projection is one with common initial and final subspace: :P:\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{H}:\\\\quad\\\\mathcal{I}P=\\\\mathcal{F}P  Embeddings  Any isometric embedding is one with full initial subspace: :J:\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\hookrightarrow\\\\mathcal{K}:\\\\quad\\\\mathcal{I}J=\\\\mathcal{H}  Unitaries  Any unitary operator is one with full initial and final subspace: :U:\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\leftrightarrow\\\\mathcal{K}:\\\\quad\\\\mathcal{I}U=\\\\mathcal{H},\\\\,\\\\mathcal{F}U=\\\\mathcal{K} (Apart from these there are far more partial isometries.)  Examples = Nilpotents  On the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space the matrix : \\\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} is a partial isometry with initial subspace : \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{C} and final subspace : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\oplus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}.  Leftshift and Rightshift  On the square summable sequences the operators :R:\\\\ell^2(\\\\mathbb{N})\\\\to\\\\ell^2(\\\\mathbb{N}):(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots)\\\\mapsto(0,x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots) :L:\\\\ell^2(\\\\mathbb{N})\\\\to\\\\ell^2(\\\\mathbb{N}):(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots)\\\\mapsto(x_2,x_3,\\\\ldots) which are related by :R^*=L are partial isometries with initial subspace :LR(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots)=(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots) and final subspace: :RL(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots)=(0,x_2,\\\\ldots).

History Nathan Road in the 1920s (Cameron Road on right) Saint Andrew's Church The first section of the road was completed in 1861. It was the very first road built in Kowloon, after the land was ceded by the Qing dynasty government to the United Kingdom and made part of the crown colony in 1860. The road was originally named Robinson Road, after Sir Hercules Robinson, the 5th Governor of Hong Kong. To avoid confusion with the Robinson Road on Hong Kong Island, the name was changed to Nathan Road in 1909,The Hong Kong Government Gazette, March 19, 1909 after Sir Matthew Nathan, the 13th Governor who served between 1904 and 1907. The early Nathan Road was largely residential, with colonial-style houses with arched verandahs and covered archways. It was home to the Whitfield Barracks, which later became Kowloon Park. Saint Andrew's Church, the oldest Anglican church in Kowloon, has been located there since its completion in 1906. The section of the road from Gascoigne Road to Argyle Street was originally named Coronation Road (Âä†ÂÜïÈÅì), in honour of the coronation of King George V in 1911. The road was renamed as part of Nathan Road in 1926, after works joining the road and Nathan Road was completed. The section of Tai Po Road south of Boundary Street was also renamed as part of the road.

Personal life Aside from the birth certificate recording his birth in Paris in 1738, very little is known about Jean-Baptiste Alliette's youth. His father was a ma√Ætre r√¥tisseur, a caterer, and his mother was a seed merchant.Decker, Ronald, Thierry Depaulis and Michael Dummett. A Wicked Pack of Cards: The Origins of the Occult Tarot. London: Gerald Duckworth & Co. Ltd., 1996. pp. 77 He married Jeanne Vattier in 1763, a marriage that lasted half a decade, during which he worked as a seed merchant, before publishing his first book, Etteilla, ou mani√®re de se r√©cr√©er avec un jeu de cartes (\\"Etteilla, or a Way to Entertain Yourself With a Deck of Cards\\") in 1770.Decker, Depaulis, & Dummett, 74 Etteilla is simply the reverse of his surname. Works Death card designed by Etteilla, published 1890 Etteilla, ou mani√®re de se r√©cr√©er avec un jeu de cartes was a discourse on the usage of regular playing cards (the piquet deck, a shortened deck of 32 cards used in gaming, with the addition of an \\"Etteilla\\" card). Features included the \\"spread\\", or disposition on the table, and strictly assigned meanings to each card both in regular and in reversed positions, characteristics that are still central to tarot divination today. In his preface, \\"Etteilla\\" explained that he had learned his system from an Italian; it remains unclear to what extent his assigned symbology was his own contribution. The book was reprinted the following year. He was working as a printseller, but from this time, approximately, he earned his livelihood by working as a consultant, teacher and author. In 1781 the French Swiss Protestant clergyman and occultist Antoine Court who named himself Court de G√©belin published in his massive work Le Monde primitif his idea that the Tarot was actually an ancient Egyptian book of arcane wisdom. There is no evidence to support the notion that tarot has an Egyptian lineage, but in the stir that followed, Etteilla responded with another book, Mani√®re de se r√©cr√©er avec le jeu de cartes nomm√©es Tarots (\\"How to Entertain Yourself With the Deck of Cards Called Tarot\\") in 1785.Decker, Depaulis, & Dummett, 84 It was the first book of methods of divination by Tarot. In it Etteilla claimed that he had been introduced into the art of cartomancy in 1751, long before the appearance of Court de Gebelin's work.

The surah that opens with the oath of the Divine One swearing by every one of the stars, as they descend and disappear beneath the horizon, that Muhammad is indeed God‚Äôs awaited Messenger. It takes its name from Ayat #1, which mentions \\"the stars\\" (najm). The surah confirms the divine source of the Prophet‚Äôs message and refers to his ascension to heaven during the Night Journey (Ayah#1 ff.). The surah refutes the claims of the disbelievers about the goddesses and the angels (ayah#19 ff.), and lists several truths about God‚Äôs power. It closes with a warning of the imminent Day of Judgement. The surah is distinguished as being the first that required Muslims to prostrate, or perform sajdah, when it is recited, according to Tafsir Ibn Kathir and a number of hadiths. The surah claims that, when it was first narrated by Muhammad in Mecca, all Muslims and non-Muslims who heard the recitation prostrated to God upon its completion due to the effect that the words had upon them.  Exegesis =Q53:1-18 legitimacy of Muhammad‚Äôs prophetic vision The last line of An-Najm: \\"So prostrate to Allah and worship [Him].\\" The first eighteen verses of this surah are considered to be some of the earliest revelations of the Quran. These verses address the legitimacy of Muhammad‚Äôs prophetic visions. The surah begins with the divine voice swearing by the collapsing star that \\"Your companion,\\" referring to Muhammad, has not gone mad, nor does he speak out of his desire. The passage evokes the process of vision by tracing the movement along the highest horizon and then coming down and drawing near to the distance of \\"two bows\\" length. The passage ends with the affirmation of the validity of the vision by stating that the heart of the prophet \\"did not lie in what it saw.\\" Q53:49 the star Sirius The surah is also known for referencing the star Sirius in verse 49 where it is given the name (transliteration: a≈°-≈°i‚ÄòrƒÅ or ash-shira; the leader). The verse is: \\"\\", \\"That He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star).\\" (53:49) Ibn Kathir said in his commentary \\"that it is the bright star, named Mirzam Al-Jawza' (Sirius), which a group of Arabs used to worship.\\" The alternate (to Sirius) Aschere, used by Johann Bayer, is derived from this.

Some verses refer to the Splitting of the moon. \\"Qamar\\" (), meaning \\"Moon\\" in Arabic, is also a common name among Muslims. Significance of Al-Qamar Al-Qamar, meaning \\"moon\\" in Arabic, is an important title for surah 54. The first verse is traditionally thought to refer to a miracle performed by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Meccan phase of his career, in which he showed the moon split in two in response to a challenge from his opponents. The disbelieving response is then recorded in the second verse \\"But if they see a sign they turn away and say 'Continuous sorcery!'\\" Several reports concerning this incident are contained in canonical hadith books, traced back to various Companions. According to those who downplay the miraculous, on the other hand, it foreshadows the inevitable Day of Judgment that will divide those who believe from those who disbelieve‚Äîthose who are destined to Paradise and those who are destined to Hell. Because this Meccan surah's primary theme centers around the fate of those who disbelieve, the symbolic use of the moon is meant to warn the disbelievers of their impending fate in the first verse, as ‚Äúthe hour draws near; the moon is split‚Äù.Haleem, M.A.S. Abdel. The Quran (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 350. Additionally, the crescent moon acts as a vital symbol of Islam and thus, in this instance, may denote the importance of the emerging religion, as lunar cycles determine the structure of the Islamic calendar.\\"Moon.\\" In The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. , edited by John L. Esposito. Oxford Islamic Studies Online, http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1545 Chronology Surah 54 is wholly Meccan, as its verses ‚Äúdemonstrate complex reference and demanding grammatical connections to surrounding verses‚Äù.Ernst, Carl W., How to Read the Quran: A New Guide with Select Translations (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2011) 105 Indeed, it is a mixture of exclamatory statements and rhetorical questions directed towards Muhammad, which is yet another reference to the surah's Meccan nature. That God directly addresses Muhammad with personal pronouns, ‚Äúyou‚Äù and ‚Äúyour‚ÄùHaleem, 351 and differentiates the unbelieving audience from His personal addresses to Muhammad with ‚Äúthey‚Äù and ‚Äúthem‚Äù strongly indicates that Islam was still in the development phase and that God did not yet have a particularized audience to address. Instead, God merely warns Muhammad of the possible responses that will result from his efforts to spread His message and the resultant punishment that He will inflict upon those who refuse to believe. Officially, this surah is believed to be the thirty-seventh surah revealed to Muhammad, as the Egyptian chronology indicates.Quran Chapters and their Chronological Sequence of Revelation - International Community of Submitters (ICS) https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/chapters_chronological_sequence.html&date;=2011-05-13 N√∂ldeke, however, numbers this surah as the forty-ninth chronological surah. The difference in numerical order is, perhaps, due to the difference in Meccan and Medinan surahs within each edition. For instance, the Egyptian chronology indicates that there are eighty-eight Meccan surahs and twenty-six Medinan surahs; whereas Noldeke's chronology divides the Meccan period into three, with forty-eight in the first, twenty-one in the second, and twenty-one in the third in addition to twenty-four Medinan surahs.Ernst, 45 Exegesis This surah clearly directs its message toward the unbelievers in Mecca. Indeed, it covers themes of rejection, truth, and punishment, all of which are addressed in stories of previous peoples. The stories of the people of Noah, the people of ‚ÄòAd, the people of Thamud, the people of Lot, and the people of Pharaoh represent times during which a people refused to believe the word of the above messengers; consequently, they suffered God's wrath. Each unit follows a similar pattern: first, God describes the peoples‚Äô refusal to believe and the resultant punishment for refusing to accept His warnings. As Carl Ernst writes in How to Read the Qur‚Äôan, surahs from the middle to late Meccan period follow a ‚Äútripartite division,‚Äù in which one observes a ‚Äúring structure, beginning and ending with parallel sections‚Äù of divine praise, heavy threats for the unbelievers, and staunch affirmations of the revelation. These parts bookend a somewhat larger middle section, which is ‚Äútypically a narrative of prophecy and struggle.‚ÄùErnst, 105 Thus, this Meccan surah seems to connect the early Meccan period with the later, as traces of the shorter, more affirmative surahs can be found in particular verses, which resemble ‚Äúpowerful oath formulations‚Äù and generate fear in those who may not fully accept the Islamic faith. Within the parallel sections of the ring-like structure of this surah are narratives of the critical choices that Muhammad's audience will face‚Äîwhether to act as did the previous peoples and to reject Muhammad's message and endure unbearable consequences or to accept God as ‚Äúthe Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy,‚ÄùHaleem, 350 and to live eternally ‚Äúamong Gardens and rivers‚Äù.Haleem, 352 Such a choice acts as a testament to God's omnipotence and utter omniscience. Q54:18 ‚Äúeverything is recorded‚Äù God, is all- knowing, as the surah both begins and ends with a warning that ‚Äúeverything is recorded‚Äù and ‚Äúeverything they do is noted in their records: every action, great or small is recorded‚Äù. The first eight verses distinctly refer to events on the Day of Judgment, especially the fates of the disbelievers on that ‚Äúhard day‚Äù, except for the splitting of the moon, since that was a still-unexplained celestial event witnessed by many of the Companions in or around Mecca, and the characteristic rejection of such miraculous events as sorcery by the unbelievers. The first verse in particular uses ‚Äúthe Hour\\" (as-saa‚Äôa) to refer the end times and is used in 46 instances throughout the Quran to make mention of the hour (likely a symbolic temporal period) when Allah will judge humankind and punish the unbelievers. This first section is marked by its apocryphal tone and its introduction to the themes of disbelief and failure to heed warnings, which echo through the remainder of the surah. Q54:9-42 previous instances where the word of God was not heeded The middle section of this Quranic surah, which Ernst marks from verse 9 to 42, relates to prior Hebrew and Arab oral traditions to remind the audience of previous instances where the word of God was not heeded and stern consequences resulted. The first of the five examples is the story of Noah, whose rejection by his own people is relatable to the situation Muhammad found himself in early in his prophetic career. According to the Quran, men referred to both Noah and Muhammad as crazy or majnoon‚Äîthe same Arabic word is used in both of these references. There are four more examples of rejected prophets in the middle section of surah 54, wherein the stories of ‚ÄòAd, Thamud, Lot, and Pharaoh are mentioned to reiterate the lesson that those who fail to heed Allah‚Äôs warnings through His messengers will be punished. (The stories of ‚ÄòAd and Thamud come from Arab folklore and the Quran briefly describes the wrath that both of these peoples incurred because of their disbelief.) Take note that the five Hebrew/Arab stories are told in a manner that assumes the audience has a working knowledge of the myth before its telling in the Quran. Unlike the Old Testament, these stories are neither told in their entirety nor are they told in a chronological narrative. Instead, key points of the story are mentioned to bring out an important faith-based lesson from the story, with the assumption that the audience already understands the underlying narrative. For example, the story of Pharaoh only takes up two verses in which there is only space to mention that a warning came to his people, they rejected the signs, and Allah ‚Äúovercame them with the seizing of the Mighty, the Powerful.‚Äù Something else to note about this middle section is how many times the Quran references itself. In fact, it does so four times in the same context, at the end of the first four ‚Äúdisbeliever‚Äù examples. Each of these four lines (54:17,22,32,40) reads: ‚ÄúWe have made it easy to learn lessons from the Quran: will anyone take heed?‚ÄùHaleem, 54:17 Some versions interpret this line to say: ‚ÄúAnd certainly We have made the Quran easy to remember, but is there anyone who will mind?‚ÄùThe Holy Quran with English Translation and Commentary. Trans. Maulana Muhammad Ali. USA: Ahmadiyya Anjuman Isha'at Islam Lahore, Inc. 2002. The difference here is important because of the connotation of the Arabic word dhikr, which can refer to lessons, the act of remembering, memorization, recalling, and many other meanings that come from the same root, which is used over 200 times in the Quran. This aya could be referring to the lessons of faith and morality and the ease with which they can be gleaned from the Quran, as a book. However, it could also be using the word Quran here to refer to its more literal Arabic meaning‚Äîwhich is ‚Äúrecitation‚Äù‚Äîrather than referring to the book itself. There is no doubt that this is an occasion where the Quran is self-referential, but it is interesting that in other sections of the Quran (12:2, 15:1), the word Quran, itself, seems to refer to the word of Allah as it is recited, which includes vowels (thus clarifying much of the meaning). (It is important to note that the Quran in its earliest written forms lacked most vowels and the written consonants served as a reminder for those reciting the Quran.) Thus, the verse could mean that the surahs are easily remembered because of their poetic and song-like form in their spoken versions: their rhyming schemes, cadences, and robust structure. According to the scripture, Allah then asks (rhetorically) who will take on the task of remembering or internalizing these words. The purpose of the middle section of this Surah, then, is to draw attention to examples from the past of unbelievers and their punishments, challenging the people of Muhammad's time to finally heed and recognize Allah's Prophet. =Q54:42 ...but they rejected all Our signs= It is narrated that Muhammad al-Baqir, when asked about verse [54:42]... but they rejected all Our signs..., replied that \\"signs refer to all the successors of the Prophets\\". Q54:43-55 evils that will befall the unbelievers The final section of the surah (54:43-55) returns to an apocryphal tone, warning of the evils that will befall the unbelievers in the end time. Again, ‚Äúthe Hour‚Äù is used twice in these final ayaat to mention the Day of Judgment. At that time, those who are guilty are said to be dragged into the fires of Hell (saqar), as Allah knows that the fate every group of disbelievers is the same‚Äîtheir time is limited. The last section closes the ‚Äúring‚Äù by reverting the narrative back to the introductory section, wherein we read of visual images of the Day of Judgment. Plus, consistent with Ernst's notions, the surah ends with a ‚Äúflourishing‚Äù couplet that details the rewards of the ‚Äúdutiful‚Äù in the afterlife, seated with ‚Äúa most powerful king.‚ÄùAli, 54:55 The constant repetition in this surah is particularly relevant, as it contributes to the overall development of God's character. In his many rhetorical questions such as, ‚ÄúWe have made it easy to learn lessons from the Quran: will anyone take heed?‚Äù and the final question directed towards Muhammad, ‚ÄúAre your disbelievers any better than these?‚Äù Firstly, the constant repetition of the Quranic lessons question establishes God as merciful and fair in his punishment, as He ensures that He gave the unbelievers full warning and clear direction; however, they chose not to follow His commands and are thus deserving of their respective punishments. As the surah ends, however, God asserts his ability to inflict punishment upon the disbelievers: ‚Äúwhen We ordain something it happens at once, in the blink of an eye; We have destroyed the likes of you in the past. Will anyone take heed?‚Äù. With this final rhetorical question, God instead establishes the breadth of His power, as He highlights the utter immediacy with which He could rid the earth of the unbelievers. However, He ensures that His omnipotence will benefit the righteous, as they will live ‚Äúsecure in the presence of an all-powerful Sovereign‚Äù.

Theodor N√∂ldeke and Carl Ernst have categorized it among the surahs of the early Meccan period (in accordance with its short ayah length), but Abdel Haleem has categorized it in his translation as Medinan,Haleem, The Qur‚Äôan, 353. although most Muslim scholars place S≈´rat ar-Rahman in the Meccan period. According to the traditional Egyptian chronology, Ar-Rahman was the 97th surah revealed.Carl Ernst, How to Read the Qur'an (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2011), 40. N√∂ldeke places it earlier, at 43,Ernst, How to Read the Qur'an, 44. while Ernst suggests that it was the fifth surah revealed.Ernst, How to Read the Qur'an, 215.  Structure  Ar-Rahman is composed entirely in saj‚Äô, the rhymed, accent-based prose characteristic of early Arabic poetry.\\"Rhyming Prose\\", in Encyclopaedia of the Qur‚Äôan, ed. Jane Dammen McAuliffe (Leiden: Brill, 2001). The most notable structural feature of Ar-Rahman is the refrain \\"Which, then, of your Lord‚Äôs blessings do you both deny?\\"Haleem, The Qur‚Äôan, 353. (or, in Arberry‚Äôs rendering, \\"O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?\\"Arberry, The Koran, Q55:15.), which is repeated 31 times in the 78 verses. Chapter 55 is composed of 26 couplets, 4 tercets, and an introductory stanza of 13 verses all ending with this refrain. The final couplet is followed by a blessing of God‚Äôs name. Thematically, Ar-Rahman can be divided into roughly three units. *Verses 1-30 expound upon natural displays of Allah‚Äôs creative power and mercy in showering those who inhabit the earth with blessings. *Verses 31-45 describe the final judgment and the terrible punishment that will be inflicted upon sinners. *Verses 46-78, by contrast, detail the delights that await the pious in paradise.  Content  One of the chapter's main aims is to chastise mankind and jinn for their lack of gratitude towards God. Verses 1-30 describe some of the resources (fruits, palm trees, husked grain, fragrant plants, fresh and salt water, pearls, ships) that God has provided out of clay and smokeless fire (55:14), and set down under a sky illuminated by the twin risings of the sun and moon (55:17). Verses 1-4 recount that God taught mankind how to communicate and even gave him the Qur'an to guide him on the path to righteousness. The refrain, \\"Which, then, of your Lord‚Äôs blessings do you both deny?\\", chastises for failing to acknowledge their indebtedness to God. The punishment that awaits the ungrateful is described in verses 35-45. For the remainder of the chapter, the delights of the gardens of paradise (replete with shading branches, flowing springs, fruit, maidens, couches, cushions, and fine carpets) are lyrically described, punctuated throughout by the refrain. The surah also exemplifies the Qur'an‚Äôs tendency to be self-referential and self-validating, as when in verse 2 it emphasizes the fact that Allah taught the Qur'an to man out of mercy. In terms of theological developments, Ar-Rahman introduces a three- tiered classification of men and jinn: *the best of believers (\\"those near to God\\", the muqarrabƒ´n who will ascend to the higher garden of paradise), *the ordinary believers (\\"those at his right\\", the ashƒÅt al-yamƒ´n who will enjoy the second garden of paradise), and *the disbelievers (who will be punished in Hell). This division is echoed in the following chapter (Al-Waqi‚Äôa). The surah is dominated stylistically by pairs. To begin with, it is addressed to a dual audience of mankind and jinn: in Haleem‚Äôs translation of the refrain \\"Which, then, of your Lord‚Äôs blessings do you both deny?\\", \\"both\\" is understood to refer to men and jinn (likewise for the \\"you and you\\" in Arberry‚Äôs rendering). Natural phenomena are also referred to in pairs: for example, \\"the sun and the moon\\" (55:5), \\"the stars and the trees\\" (55:6), \\"the two risings and the two settings [of the sun and the moon]\\" (55:17), and \\"the two bodies of [fresh and salt] water\\" (55:19). In addition, paradise is described as consisting of two double gardens (55:62), each of which contain a pair of springs (55:50, 55:66) and fruit in pairs (55:52). Verses=Q55:70-77 Houri Muhammad Asad asserts that the \\"noun hur - rendered as 'companions pure' - is a plural of both ahwar (masculine) and hawra' (female), either of which describes a person distinguished by hawar', which latter term primarily denotes 'intense whiteness of the eyeballs and lustrous black of the iris'. Asad as well as Yusuf Ali & Pickthall translate this verse as: According to Ibn Kathir, the believer will be given a tent 60 miles wide, made of pearl, such that his wives will not see each other. The believer will visit them all. The Enlightening Commentary into the Light of the Holy Qur'an says that they (the Houri) are good and righteous virgins and are intended to have intercourse only with their husbands. Hadith Owing to the sura‚Äôs poetic beauty , it is often regarded as the 'beauty of the Quran' , in accordance with a hadith: Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (R.A.) reported that Muhammad said, \\"Everything has an adornment, and the adornment of the Qur'an is Surah ar Rahman\\" .

Al- Waqi'a (; \\"The Inevitable\\" or \\"The Event\\") is the 56th surah (chapter) of the Quran. Muslims believe it was revealed in Mecca (see Meccan surah), specifically around 7 years before the Hegira (622), the migration of Muhammad to Medina. The total number of verses in this surah are 96. It mainly discusses the afterlife according to Islam, and the different fates people will face in it.  Revelation history  According to Quranic commentators, the chapter is a Meccan sura, that is, it was revealed during the Meccan period of Muhammad's prophethood. Some commentators, although not in the majority, argue that part of it was revealed during the Medinan period. Some of such commentators maintain that verses 39‚Äì40 are the verses that was from the Medinan period, while some say 81‚Äì82, and others say 83. The traditional Egyptian chronology puts the chapter as the 41st chapter by the order of revelation (after Al-Tur), while the N√∂ldeke Chronology (by the orientalist Theodor N√∂ldeke) puts it as the 46th. The chapter's position in the Quran, which is not determined by the revelation order, is as the 56th chapter, right after Ar-Rahman which discusses partly related topic. Some commentators, such as Ahmad ibn Ajiba consider Al-Waqi'a a continuation of Ar-Rahman.  Content  The Afterlife (akhirah) is the main topic discussed in the chapter. Picking up from the preceding chapter, Ar-Rahman, which discusses the rewards of Paradise (jannah), this chapter also mentions them and then contrasts them with the punishment of hell. The chapter also distinguishes the three classes of people in the afterlife, \\"the foremost\\", \\"the companions of the right\\" and \\"the companions of the left\\". According to chapter, the first two groups will enter paradise while the companions of the left will go to hell. Here, \\"the right\\" is associated with goodness, the righteous will be seated to the right of God's throne and receive their records of deeds in their right hand. The \\"foremost\\" refers to a special group of people who will have an even better fate than the companion of the right in the afterlife. Quranic commentators differ on understanding who the foremost is. They variously identify the foremost with the prophets, the saints, the truthful, the martyrs, the first to accept Islam, and others.

Twenty years later, after Smith's inventions have made the family rich, the affable Ronnie, who is Emma's favorite, arrives home from college, announcing that he wants to quit school and become a pilot. The other Smith children, Bill, Gypsy and Isabelle, have all grown into spoiled adults, but Emma lovingly indulges them all, making excuses for their bad behavior to their father and everyone else. As Emma leaves for her first vacation in 32 years with the family, the absent-minded Frederick sadly takes her to the station. She gets cold feet and decides to stay home, but Frederick won't let her and decides to go along with her to Niagara Falls. Waiting for their train, Frederick proposes and Emma accepts, even though she is afraid that people will talk. When the children learn about the marriage, Ronnie is happy for them, but the other children are embarrassed by the blot on their social record. On their honeymoon, as the happy Frederick and Emma row on the lake, they are teased by some young vacationers, prompting Frederick to take the oars from Emma. The exertion causes a mild heart attack and they return home. As the contented Frederick listens to Emma sing to him, he dies, and a short time later, the family learns that he has left his entire estate to Emma. Though Emma wants to give the money back to the children, all of them except Ronnie turn on her and threaten to prove that their father was crazy when he wrote the will. Emma throws them out and awaits the lawsuit they threaten while the loyal Ronnie goes to Canada for a flying assignment. Because the will cannot be broken, the children go to the district attorney to have him bring murder charges against Emma, using distorted testimony by Mathilda, the maid. When Ronnie hears about the trial, he desperately flies East to help Emma but is killed while flying through a dangerous storm. Even though her life is in peril, she won't allow her kind attorney Haskins to defame the character or motives of the children.

It was originally intended as an individually packaged daily ration for issue to airborne troops, tank crews, motorcycle couriers, and other mobile forces for short durations.U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum, RATIONS: The History of Rations, Conference Notes prepared for the Quartermaster General, The Quartermaster School (January 1949) http://old.qmfound.com/history_of_rations.htm The K-ration provided three separately boxed meal units: Breakfast, Dinner, and Supper.  History  In 1941, Ancel Keys, a University of Minnesota physiologist, was assigned by the U.S. War Department to design a non-perishable, ready-to-eat meal that could fit in a soldier's pocket as a short-duration, individual ration. Keys went to a local supermarket to choose foods that would be inexpensive, but still be enough to provide energy. He purchased hard biscuits, dry sausages, hard candy, and chocolate bars. He then tested his , meals on six soldiers in a nearby army base. The meals only gained \\"palatable\\" and \\"better than nothing\\" ratings from the soldiers, but were successful in relieving hunger and providing sufficient energy. The new rations were initially intended as individual rations suitable for short durations only, to be used for a maximum of fifteen meals before supplementation or replacement with 'A-ration' or 'B-ration' field rations.Longino, James C. (Col.), Rations in Review, The Quartermaster Review, May‚ÄìJune 1946: Col. Longino noted that the K-ration was originally intended to be used for no more than 15 consecutive meals. They were soon called the \\"paratrooper ration\\", since paratroopers were the first to be issued the ration on an experimental basis. The actual prototype of the K-ration was a pocket ration for paratroopers developed by the Subsistence Research Laboratory (SRL) at the request of the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) early in the war.U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum, Army Operational Rations - Historical Background, http://old.qmfound.com/army_rations_historical_background.htm Two original samples (one version used pemmican biscuits, a peanut bar, raisins, and bouillon paste; the other used pemmican biscuits, a small D ration bar, canned processed meat, and lemon beverage powder) evolved into the one-package breakfast-dinner-supper combination later adopted as standard. The Quartermaster Command's Subsistence Branch altered some components and renamed the ration the Field Ration, Type K, or \\"K-ration\\"; the final version totaled .Tucker, Todd, The Great Starvation Experiment: The Heroic Men Who Starved So That Millions Could Live, Simon and Schuster (2006), , , pp. 30‚Äì31.The first procurement of K-rations was made in May 1942. Some believed the K-ration was named after Dr. Keys or was short for \\"Commando\\" (as elite troops were the first to receive it). However, the letter \\"K\\" was selected because it was phonetically distinct from other letter-name rations. The K-ration first saw use in 1942, when it was issued to U.S. Airborne troops on an experimental basis. Initial reports praised it for the variety of the foods incorporated, as well as the light weight. However, testing in extreme climatic and operating environments was extremely limited: in jungle testing, for example, the K-ration was evaluated in Panama by paratroopers and the Panama Jungle Test Platoon in an experiment lasting only three days.Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 292‚Äì293. Marching was done not through jungle, as might be expected, but only on flat or gently rolling terrain on cleared roads, for an average of only per day. The test platoons carried one K-ration, weapon, poncho, shelter half, and a single filled one-quart canteen. No testing was done of men on extended patrols or with heavier individual loads of ammunition and water. At the end of the three days, the men were weighed, and as no abnormal weight loss was noted, the K-ration was deemed successful. These findings were later used in 1943 to support a decision to discontinue production of the Mountain ration and the Jungle ration.Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 291‚Äì293. Both of these specialized rations had proved costlier to produce in their original form, and were intensely disliked by the Army's Subsistence Branch staff of the Quartermaster Corps, who had to secure additional supply contracts and storage facilities for the new rations. Though the K-ration was designed to be an emergency ration, Quartermaster Corps officials would continue to insist until the end of the war that the K-ration would satisfy all requirements for a lightweight complete field ration for all front-line troops at a scale of one K-ration per man per day, using the prior experiments with airborne forces as evidence. The ration's intended use as a short-term assault ration would soon fall by the wayside once U.S. forces entered combat. One major criticism of the K-ration was its caloric and vitamin content, judged as inadequate based on evaluations made during and after World War II of the ration's actual use by Army forces.Youmans, John B. (Dr.), Preventive Medicine in World War II, Vol III: Personal Health Measures and Immunization. Chapter IV \\"Nutrition\\", U.S. Army Medical Publications, U.S. Government Printing Office (1969), p. 129. There was also a danger of over-reliance, which could cause the three meals to become monotonous if issued for long periods of time.Henry, Mark R. and Chappell, Mike, The US Army in World War II (1): The Pacific, Osprey Publishing (2000), , , pp. 20‚Äì21 The K-ration allowance was one ration per man per day, (breakfast, dinner and supper) because of the short duration and hasty nature of experimental testing of the K-ration before adoption. Ration planners did not realize that soldiers fighting, digging, and marching in extreme conditions would require many more calories per day than a soldier marching over cleared roads in temperate climates. Nevertheless, one K-ration per man per day would remain the basis of issue, even for mountain troops fighting at high altitudes and infantrymen fighting in the thick jungles of Burma. Military personnel also supplemented with various other rations throughout the war such as with the C-ration when needed. Evaluation and field reports The C-ration was the only ration comparable to the K-ration in widespread issue, with six cans comprising one full ration. Introduced in 1938 it was significantly heavier, with less variety in meals, but had more protein. While fighting in the European Theater of Operations, the US Army discovered that troops also quickly got tired of the K-ration, some being forced to eat it for days, or rarely, in excess of a week on end. As it was based on an emergency ration, a complete K-ration was for the ration (breakfast, dinner and supper), fewer than required by highly active men, especially those working in extreme heat or bitter cold, and malnutrition became evident. The packaging of the K-ration into separately described daily meals may have intensified this problem by leading commanders to assume that daily caloric intake was sufficient. An extensive 1943 field report from the European theater noted that none of the packaged rations were recommended for continued use by active troops for periods in excess of 10 days.Field Trial, Special Rations: European Theater of Operations, U.S. Army, (July 1943) A survey of troops in the forward areas and evacuation hospitals of the Fifth U.S. Army serving in the Italian campaign noted that almost all soldiers questioned in infantry, engineer, and other mobile forward units said they had lost weight since the beginning of the Italian campaign. Surgeons commented upon a noticeable decrease in body fat and wasting of muscle, requiring copious feeding and rest, as well as ascorbic acid (Vitamin C).Field Survey, Essential Technical Medical Data, North African Theater of Operations, U.S. Army for December 1943, 27 January 1944, Appendix V The K-ration was also criticized for its performance in the China-Burma-India (CBI) theater of operations, where difficulties in supply from bases in India had resulted in widespread and monotonous use of the K-ration for light infantry forces of the United States, as well as Nationalist China and the United Kingdom. Many soldiers, including the U.S. unit known as Merrill's Marauders and British Chindit forces in Burma, had for five months lived primarilyHopkins, James (M.D.), Stelling, Henry (M.D.), and Voorhees, Tracy S., \\"The Marauders and The Microbes: A Record of Righteous Indignation\\", Infantry Journal 64 (March 1949) p. 302: http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/CrisisFleeting/bookfive.htm on K-rations, supplemented by rice, tea, sugar, jam, bread, and canned meat rations, which were dropped to them by air. In the case of the Marauders, whose diet consisted of 80% K-rations, severe weight loss (an average of per man) and vitamin deficiency were noted, which may have also contributed to a decline in resistance to various tropical diseases. A British medical officer reported that, of 209 Chindits examined at the end of this time, 182 had lost up to and 27 had lost from . Deficiency diseases such as pellagra and beriberi were diagnosed. One of British General Orde Wingate's units in the Dehra Dun area was visited by quartermaster logistics officers some months after they had last eaten K-rations. At the sight of a box of K-rations carried by the visitors, two of Wingate's men vomited.Heaton, Leonard D., and Anderson, Robert S. (eds), Internal Medicine in World War II, Volume 3, Infectious Diseases and General Medicine, Chapter X, Nutritional Disorders, Falls Church, VA: Office of the Surgeon General, pp. 238‚Äì239. The unpalatable nature of some of the K-ration's components, such as the fatty pork loaf or the highly acidic lemon powder,Moran, B., \\"Dinner Goes to War: The Long Battle for Edible Combat Rations is Finally Being Won\\", American Heritage of Invention & Technology, Summer 1998, Vol. 14, No. 1, pp. 10‚Äì19: \\"The lemonade powder in the K-ration, the sole source of Vitamin C, was so acidic that soldiers commonly joked that it worked better as a floor cleaner than as a drink.\\" caused many users to throw them away, further reducing actual consumed calorific content. Often, a secondary food source was issued, such as a D-ration bar, or fresh oranges, in an attempt to bring up the calorie and vitamin content. In 1943, a ration board headed by the chief of the Nutrition Branch, Office of the Chief Surgeon, was appointed and directed to conduct comprehensive field tests on rations which would be used later in combat. In the first of these field tests it was noted that troops remained in reasonably good physical condition during a 10-day period on C, K, and five-in-one rations but that the rations were deficient in calories, especially for large men. The report listed the following recommendations: The use of the D ration as a supplement only; the further restriction of the use of C and K-rations to five-day periods unless supplemented; and the replacement of the wholly unsatisfactory dextrose and malted tablets of the K-ration with a more acceptable substitute. Additionally, replacement of the fruit powder component of C- and K-rations with a source of ascorbic acid that would guarantee the utilization of this nutrient was recommended, as the current diet of troops operating on individual rations in the field was almost wholly devoid of ascorbic acid. By war's end, millions of K-rations had been produced, but the army had lost interest in them. Postwar Army supply plans for field rations relied solely on heavier canned wet rations, initially the C-ration, later by similar canned rations such as the MCI, primarily to save additional cost of procurement and storage. In 1948, after introduction of improvements in the C-ration, the K-ration was declared obsolete; production contracts had long since terminated. Most existing K-ration stocks were declared surplus, and distributed to civilian feeding programs overseas. Packaging The K-ration originally came packed in an unbleached tan-colored rectangular cardstock box with black lettering. The outer box was printed on its top in bold capital sans serif block letter type with the text: \\"US ARMY FIELD RATION K\\", with the meal unit type (BREAKFAST, DINNER, or SUPPER UNIT) printed underneath it and a capital letter on each end (B, D, or S). While it was intended that the three meals be eaten in their named order, they were not always consumed in this manner. The inner box had the meal unit type printed across its top and a capital letter on each end (B, D, or S). The later \\"Morale Series\\" had unique packaging designs that were color-coded and letter-coded on the ends for quick identification. The breakfast ration box had brown printing and was marked with a brown capital letter \\"B\\" on the ends, the dinner ration box had blue printing and was marked with a blue capital letter \\"D\\" on the ends, and the supper ration box had olive drab printing and was marked with an olive drab capital \\"S\\" on the ends. The packaging commencing with the earliest version of the ration consisted of a chemically-treated cardboard outer carton and a waterproofed waxed-cardboard inner carton to protect the contents from contamination or damage. The waxed carton was found useful by soldiers to start small fires in which to boil water for coffee or cocoa. The entr√©e came in a small, round metal can painted green with black lettering, with a metal key (dubbed a \\"twist key\\") to open it, packaged in a roughly square cardboard box. The rest of the meal came packed neatly in a waxed paper or laminated cellophane pack. The pack always contained two packages of 8 rectangular K-1 or 4 square K-2 calorie-dense cracker biscuits each, a 4-pack of commercial- grade cigarettes, and either a flat rectangular stick of chewing gum or a square piece of candy-coated gum. Special items (like matches or Halazone tablets) were packed in one unit but not the others due to space limitations. Late production meals added a paper-wrapped paddle-like disposable wooden spoon and used the standard P-38 can opener instead of the \\"twist key\\". Menu *Breakfast Unit: canned entree veal (early version), canned chopped ham and eggs (all subsequent versions), biscuits, dextrose or malted milk tablets (early version), dried fruit bar, pre-mixed oatmeal cereal (late version), Halazone water purification tablets, a four-pack of cigarettes, Dentyne or Wrigley chewing gum, instant coffee, a packet of toilet paper tissues, and sugar (granulated, cubed, or compressed). *Dinner Unit: canned entree pork luncheon meat (early version), canned processed American cheese, Swiss and American cheese, or bacon and cheese (cheese entree all subsequent versions), biscuits, 15 Dextrose or malted milk (diastatic malt) tablets (early) or five caramels (late), sugar (granulated, cubed, or compressed), salt packet, a four-pack of cigarettes and a matchbook, chewing gum, and a powdered beverage packet (lemon (c.1940), orange (c. 1943), or grape (c. 1945) flavor). *Supper Unit: canned meat, consisting of cervelat sausage (early version), either pork luncheon meat with carrot or apple (first issue), beef and pork loaf (second issue); biscuits; a 2-ounce (57 g) D ration emergency chocolate bar (early version), Tropical bar, or (in temperate climates) commercial sweet chocolate bar (late version), a packet of toilet paper tissues; a four-pack of cigarettes, chewing gum, and a bouillon packet (cube or powder). In total three meals provided of food energy and 79 grams of protein, depending upon components. As it was originally intended as an \\"assault\\" ration to be issued for short durations, the K-ration was designed to be used for a maximum of 15 meals. The K-ration was mass-produced by several major U.S. food production companies, including H. J. Heinz, Patten Food Products Company and The Cracker Jack Company. K-ration crates were either wood ( each) or fiberboard ( each) and had a volume of . Each crate contained 12 daily rations (each daily ration consisting of one Breakfast unit, one Dinner unit, and one Supper unit) for a total of 36 units per crate. They were packed one unit deep, three units wide (one of each unit), and twelve units long (all of the same unit type). The U.S. Army M-1943 field uniform had simplified, but large, pockets that were designed to hold a K-ration box.

Fanning was born in Stonington, Connecticut, and was the eldest son of Gilbert Fanning and Huldah Palmer. His father was a sea merchant who was one of the largest provisioners of General George Washington's army during the American Revolution. On May 26, 1778, Fanning embarked from Boston, Massachusetts, aboard the brig Angelica as a prizemaster under the command of Captain William Denison in a cruise against the British. On May 31, Angelica was captured by the British man-of-war Andromeda and blown up, with Fanning being made a prisoner. Aboard Andromeda was General William Howe, who was returning to England. By orders of General Howe, the Americans were confined to the hold and treated severely, being allowed but a half-pint of water per day per man, even though the heat was so unbearable that the men were obliged to strip off all their clothes. On June 30, 1778, Andromeda reached Portsmouth, England, and Fanning was incarcerated at Forton prison. On July 2, 1779, Fanning was included in a prisoner exchange. He was marched to Gosport, then taken by cartel to Nantes, France. From there, he traveled to L'Orient, where, under the command of John Paul Jones, he agreed to serve as midshipman and private secretary aboard Bonhomme Richard On August 14, 1779, Bonhomme Richard set sail, and over the next month captured or destroyed at least 29 enemy vessels. On September 23, Bonhomme Richard famously fought the British frigate Serapis. During this engagement, Fanning served as captain of the main top. Most of his original group of men were killed, but he took a fresh party aloft and with them cleared Serapis' tops. When their yards locked the ships together, he led his men across to the British ship, where with hand grenades and mortars, they drove the British seamen from their stations. In recommending that Fanning be promoted, Jones said of him \\". . . he was one cause among the prominent in obtaining the victory\\". Bonhomme Richard was destroyed during this battle, but the Americans sailed to Holland aboard Serapis. Fanning continued to serve under Jones aboard his new ship Alliance and later Ariel. Fanning then served as second- in-command aboard the privateer Count de Guichen. On March 23, 1781, they set sail from Morlaix and for many weeks ransomed or sunk numerous enemy vessels. But on May 4, the privateer was captured by Aurora and Fanning was again made prisoner, but paroled after six weeks. On December 3, 1781, Fanning sailed from Ostend aboard Eclipse and had another productive cruise, returning to Dunkirk on March 6, 1782. While Eclipse was being refitted, Fanning made two trips to London, once as a spy and once to deliver peace proposals from the court of French King Louis XVI. On June 6, Eclipse left for the coast of Scotland under the command of Fanning. On August 11, Eclipse was chased by Jupiter, said to be the fastest ship in the Royal Navy. To escape Jupiter, Fanning ordered Eclipse to pass directly through the middle of the British Channel Fleet in broad daylight. To evade capture, he hoisted English colors and when hailed, answered that the ship was His Majesty's cutter Surprise. Two days later, Fanning was wounded in the left leg by a musketball while capturing Lord Howe. He sailed for Dunkirk and spent several weeks recovering. In October 1782, he was commissioned as lieutenant in the French Navy. On October 23, he sailed from Dunkirk in command of the privateer Ranger, but it was captured by a British cutter. Fanning was promptly exchanged, but his crew members, being Irish, were all executed as traitors. Returning to Dunkirk, Fanning set sail again on November 14, but was captured a fourth time by the British frigate Belle Poule. Fanning was placed in chains, and abused by the crew. He was rescued when his captors' ship was, in turn, captured by the French Navy. Learning that a peace treaty was imminent, Fanning attempted to launch yet another expedition against the British, but was unable to set sail before further privateering was prohibited. Fanning returned to the United States and, on December 5, 1804, was commissioned a lieutenant in the U.S Navy. While stationed in Charleston, South Carolina, Lieutenant Fanning died of yellow fever on September 30, 1805, while commanding Gunboat Number 1. During the American Revolution, two of Fanning's brothers, Gilbert and Thomas, were captured while serving aboard an American privateer and held prisoner on the prison hulk HMS Jersey, where Gilbert died. Fanning was also the brother of explorer Edmund Fanning and a first cousin of celebrated attorney John Wickham. Namesake Three ships in the United States Navy have been named USS Fanning for him.

Protected as a geographical indication of the European Union, only fruit spirits mashed, distilled, matured and bottled in Hungary, and similar apricot spirits from four provinces of Austria can be called \\"p√°linka\\", while \\"T√≥tp√°linka\\" refers to wheat-derived beverages. T√∂rk√∂lyp√°linka, a different product in the legal sense, is a similarly protected pomace spirit that is commonly included with p√°linka. While p√°linka may be made of any locally grown fruit, the most common ones are plums, apricots, apples, pears, and cherries. Similar products exist in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia known as P√°lenka as well as in Romania under the name PƒÉlincƒÉhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/food-safety- and-quality/certification/quality-labels/geographical-indications- register/https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/food-safety-and- quality/certification/quality-labels/geographical-indications- register/includes/showSpecification.cfm?attachmentId=55652. Etymology The words p√°linka (in Hungarian), p√°lenka (West Slavic) and pƒÉlincƒÉ (Romanian) derive from the Slavonic stem paliti, 'to burn, to distill'. In Hungarian, the word T√≥tp√°linka (literally 'Slavic p√°linka') was used to refer to alcoholic drinks derived from wheat. Legal definitions The production of Hungarian p√°linka is regulated by local law LXXIII of 2008, often referred to as \\"p√°linka law\\", which is based on the regulation of generic fruit spirits of the European Union. An alcoholic beverage may be called p√°linka if: # it is fermented exclusively from fruit (excluding concentrates and dried fruits) grown in Hungary, and free of additional ingredients, and # it is grown, distilled and bottled in Hungary, and # it is not rectified higher than 86% and is bottled with at least 37.5% ABV. While p√°linka is traditionally made from a mash of ripe fruit, the law does not control the addition of non- concentrated fruit juice, and explicitly allows the use of fruit pulp. Dried fruits are excluded from the mash only, and may be used in the aging process.Law LXXIII of 2008 in Hungarian As a consequence of this regulation, a whole family of popular Hungarian products were rebranded as szeszes ital (spirit drinks). Traditional p√°linkas mixed with honey were also rebranded as szeszes ital (or liqueur if the sugar content exceeded the required limit), even if there were no unorthodox steps in the process of distillation. Most of the brands re-categorized as spirit drinks, however, are cheap mixtures of flavorings, water, and rectified spirit. Hungarian 2002 article reviewing low- shelf spirit drinks, including two brands of ‚Äûp√°linka‚Äù made of rectified spirit and artificial flavourings. In 2004 the European Union accepted p√°linka as a Hungarian speciality, and hence its production is limited to Hungary (and four provinces of Austria for p√°linka made from apricots). This caused some confusion in neighbouring countries, as some claimed that producers of fruit spirits would have to pay a royalty to Hungary.Cazacu , Sorin, \\"The Battle for Palinka\\", in EU Observer,Transitions Online (03/04/2003) This is, however, not the case. It is the brand \\"p√°linka\\" that is protected by Hungarian and EU law, hence producers outside of Hungary are not allowed to use the brand \\"p√°linka\\" for their products, but they are free to produce fruit spirits and sell them under different names. This is in spite of the drink being historically distilled in most of the former Kingdom of Hungary, much of which falls outside present-day Hungary. In Austria, four provinces are allowed to label local apricot spirits as Barack Palinka (transliteration of Hungarian barackp√°linka): Burgenland, Lower Austria, Styria, and Vienna. Unlike Hungarian p√°linka, its Austrian counterpart may not be made with column stills, and in order to achieve a full character, careful slow distillation is required by law.Codex Alimentarius Austriacus B 23 - Spirituosen Geographical protection P√°linka as a geographical indication (in other terms, a product with protected designation of origin or PDO) has been officially registered in the European Union since 2004. While p√°linka has PDO on its own, some regions of Hungary are especially suitable for the production of certain fruits, and p√°linka of excellent quality has been produced in those regions for centuries. These local variations are protected as separate geographical indications and have their own well-detailed regulations. In order to use these protected names on the label, strict geographical and technical requirements must be met. A product not meeting the special requirements of g√∂nci barackp√°linka (apricot p√°linka of G√∂nc) for example, cannot be labeled as such, not even if it is otherwise a legitimate apricot p√°linka from G√∂nc. In Hungary, only these local variations are referred to as p√°linka with protected designations of origin. The eight palinkas with local PDO P√°linkas with PDO include szatm√°ri szilvap√°linka (plum p√°linka of Szatm√°r), kecskem√©ti barackp√°linka (apricot p√°linka of Kecskem√©t), szabolcsi almap√°linka (apple p√°linka of Szabolcs), b√©k√©si szilvap√°linka (plum p√°linka of B√©k√©s), g√∂nci barackp√°linka (apricot p√°linka of G√∂nc), √∫jfeh√©rt√≥i meggyp√°linka (sour cherry p√°linka of √öjfeh√©rt√≥), g√∂cseji k√∂rtep√°linka (pear p√°linka of G√∂csej) and pannonhalmi t√∂rk√∂lyp√°linka (pomace p√°linka of Pannonhalma).  History  The first records of the Hungarian spirit date back to the fourteenth century (1332); called Aqua vitae reginae Hungariae, it referred to the aqua vitae of the wife of the King Charles I of Hungary. This spirit was probably a spirit blended with rosemary, and had its use in medicine, as both the king and the queen suffered from arthritis. Hungarian p√°linka bottle In the 19th century, breweries and p√°linka distilleries operated in tandem. Comenius described the equipment used to make p√°linka in Orbis sensualium pictus (\\"The World in Pictures\\"), his famous book written for children in the Hungarian town of S√°rospatak. Distilling itself was the right of landowners, and laws were introduced to prevent peasants from making p√°linka at home. The use of wheat was banned, and distillation was forbidden on religious holidays. Despite this, the church still oversaw alcohol production. Records show that Cistercian monks in Heves County were brewing beer and distilling p√°linka in 1715. The role of Jewish lenders and businessmen also grew with the production of alcohol, and Saint Michael was designated patron saint of distilling. Textbooks and publications also began to appear on the subject around this time. The larger scale production of distillates, p√°linka and liqueurs from 1799 resulted in guidelines being drawn up for distillation, and the priority rights granted to landowners were made law. It was not long before a p√°linka tax was introduced, and by 1850 distillation was a state monopoly. In 1920, there were 260 p√°linka distilleries in Hungary, a figure that grew to 1,070 in 1970 before falling back down to 815 in 1982. In the meantime, various laws were introduced to restrict production, including prohibition during the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919 and the splitting of production 50-50 with the state from 1952 to 1970. Illegal home distilling became popular in the 18th century when peasant breweries were shut down. The practice was fuelled by the desire to make use of fruit that had fallen from the tree and could not be eaten, coupled with the knowledge that making p√°linka at home was much less expensive. Because the end product was often inferior, it was reserved for personal use and only offered to friends and guests. The word p√°linka became widespread in Hungary in the 17th century, but it still referred to distillates made from grain. The meaning was later transferred to fruit spirits while wheat distillates were referred to as crematura. Distillation became a privilege of the landlords, which led to the proliferation of home stills. Law forbade the use of bread-stuffs for distillation, hence the use of fruits. Private distilleries and factories started to appear towards the end of the eighteenth century, which led to legislation and to the introduction of a p√°linka tax.  Varieties  A popular saying in Hungary says: what can be used to prepare jam can also be used to produce p√°linka. For a fruit to be suitable for jam production it has to contain some sugar. This saying suggests that p√°linka can be made from a variety of fruit, and indeed it is made from most of the fruits available in Hungary. The most common p√°linkas are made from apricots, pears, and plums. Other fruits that are often used are sour cherries, apples, mulberries, and quince. P√°linka made from chestnuts or walnuts is also available. * Kis√ºsti (literally 'small pot, cauldron') is a double-distilled p√°linka made in a copper pot not exceeding a volume of 1000 litres. * √ârlelt ('aged') is a p√°linka aged for at least three months in a wooden cask smaller than 1000 litres, or for at least six months in a wooden cask of 1000 litres or above. * √ì ('old') is a p√°linka aged for at least 12 months in a wooden cask smaller than 1000 litres, or for at least 24 months in a wooden cask of 1000 litres or above. * √Ågyas ('bedded') is a p√°linka aged for at least three months together with fruit. The fruit can be of the same sort used to obtain the distillate or of another sort. To 100 liters of p√°linka at least 10 kg of ripe or 5 kg of dried fruit must be added. * T√∂rk√∂ly (Pomace p√°linka, also T√∂rk√∂lyp√°linka) is a p√°linka made from grape pomace. One of the oldest types of p√°linka, it helps digestion and is usually consumed in small quantities after meals.Act 73/2008 about p√°linka, t√∂rk√∂lyp√°linka, and P√°linka National Council Very popular, typically drunk in wine-producing regions. * Barack (pronounced \\"baratsk\\") is a type of p√°linka made of apricots. The word barack is a collective term for both apricot (in Hungarian s√°rgabarack, lit. \\"yellow-peach\\") and peach (in Hungarian ≈ëszibarack, lit. \\"autumn-peach\\").  Consumption  A tulip glass P√°linka should be served at because it is at this temperature that the fine smell and taste of the fruit can be best enjoyed. If served too cold, the smell and the taste will be difficult to appreciate. The form of the glass used to drink p√°linka affects the drinking experience. The ideal glass is wide at the bottom and narrow at the rim, that is, tulip-shaped. The relatively narrow neck of the glass concentrates the \\"nose\\" released from the larger surface at the bottom of the glass, magnifying the smell of the drink.  Production =Modern production Modern commercial production occurs in Hungary and parts of Austria. It is commonly made from the fermentation of plums, but other fruits used include apricots, apples, pears, peaches and cherries. The traditional double distillation process results in a strong alcohol content of 40 to 70 percent ABV. Commercial production Commercially available p√°linka is always distilled in one of the registered distilleries. The quality of p√°linka is largely influenced by the quality of the fruit used, hence the distiller has to choose good quality fruit with a rich taste. The first step in the production process is the preparation of the fruit mash. The stony seed is removed from the fruits that have such (e.g., cherry, apricot, plum) in order to prevent the cyanide contained in these seeds from ending up in the distillate. Some fruits (e.g., apple, pear, quince) are ground in order to make the mash soft. The second step in the production process is fermentation. Some fruits, like quince, require an additive to start the fermentation process (e.g., citric acid). The fermentation is carried out in an anaerobic environment. The ideal temperature for the fermentation process is between , and the process takes between 10 and 15 days. The third step in the production process is distillation. There are two types of distillation processes used: in a pot still or in a column still. Distillation in a pot still is considered to be the traditional way of distillation (kis√ºsti p√°linka refers to a p√°linka distilled in a pot still no bigger than 1000 litres). P√°linka distilled in a pot still is always double distilled. In the first step, the alcohol is extracted from the fermented mash; the result is called alszesz (low alcohol). In the second step, the taste of the fruit is extracted from the fermented mash. The second distillation has the biggest influence on the quality of the p√°linka and thus requires special skills. During the second distillation one distinguishes between el≈ëp√°rlat (foreshots), k√∂z√©pp√°rlat (middle cut) and ut√≥p√°rlat (feints). The el≈ëp√°rlat is not used, even though much of the taste is contained in this cut. The k√∂z√©pp√°rlat is the one that gives the body of the distillate. Distillation in a column still involves a single distillation. The process is faster and cheaper than distillation in a pot still, and hence the resulting p√°linka is cheaper. The last step in the process is aging. P√°linka can be aged in wooden casks (made of, e.g., mulberry wood) or in tanks made of metal. Not all varieties of p√°linka can be aged in wooden casks because the wood can cancel the fruity taste of the drink. Non-commercial production In Hungary, one can ferment a batch of fruit mash at home, then take the fermented mash to a distiller, who can then legally distill the mash to the desired strength. Legislation legalized small home distillers in 2010. The most alcoholic p√°linkas are (informally) referred to as ker√≠t√©sszaggat√≥ in Hungarian, which literally means \\"fence-ripper\\" (referring to a drunkard's loss of balance) or \\"guggol√≥s\\" (\\"squatter\\"), referring to the action required while walking near the windows of the houses of non-professional distillers to avoid getting invited (again) to taste their home-made p√°linka. These potent, home-made, h√°zi (home-made) p√°linkas are commercially available in small portions and are very common in the countryside.

He is best remembered for his memoirs (Pamiƒôtniki), which are a valuable historical source about Baroque sarmatian culture and events in the Commonwealth. Jan Chryzostom Pasek (Polish diarist). Britannica Online. Retrieved September 21, 2011. Biography Pasek was born in Wƒôgrzynowice (now in Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki County) in 1636,Date of birth approximated from several sources. to Pan Marian W≈Çadys≈Çaw Pasek and Pani Jadwiga Pasek (n√©e Piekarska) a petty noble family. Jan was their only child and a very much beloved son. Pasek attended a Jesuit school at Rawa. He later enlisted in the army at age 19 and for 11 years he was a soldier in the Polish military, where he initially fought in the campaigns under Hetman Stefan Czarniecki, for whom he had great respect, against the Swedish Empire during the Swedish invasion of Poland (potop szwedzki) and the 1657 Hungarian invasion of Southern Poland led by George R√°k√≥czi who had allied with the Swedish forces. In 1658 his division under Czarniecki was sent to aid the defence of Denmark where he took part in the capture of Als and the storming of Koldinghus castle. During his time in Denmark he nearly married a lady known as Eleanor of Croes Dyvarne, but instead decided to return to Poland with the rest of the army in 1659, a decision that was to personally trouble him for the rest of his life. Czarniecki's army returned to Poland and began to engage Moscovite units who had been invading from the East during 1660. Pasek took part in the Battle of Polonka in June and the Battle of Basya in October 1660. He refused to take part in the Confederacy that formed in over a lack of army pay 1661 and detested that the army would take such action just as the tide of the war against Muscovy was turning. Instead he left camp to return to his home near ≈Å√≥d≈∫, before setting off to rejoin the army of Hetman Czarniecki near . Along the way he was involved in a mix-up between loyalist and confederate forces, arrested as a suspected confederate envoy and brought to the Royal Court at Grodno. After successfully arguing his innocence and loyalty to the King, the case against him was overturned by King John II Casimir and he was given letters to take to Czarniecki. After this he was tasked with escorting Muscovite envoys to the 1662 Diet at Warsaw. Later that year he went on a pilgrimage to Czƒôstochowa where he begged for absolution for his unfulfilled engagement to Eleanor while in Denmark. Pasek was against the Lubomirski Confederacy and joined the army on the loyalist side. He despaired at the further damage done by the civil war to Poland and the loss of veteran army units during the war. He attended the Diet in 1666 during which he lamented the state of politics of the time. In 1667 Pasek married a 46-year old widow Anna (n√©e Remiszowska, primo voto ≈ÅƒÖcka) who, much to his dismay, failed to bear him any children. This he blamed on the presence of his five stepdaughters, whose later marriage or nunnery dowry's subsequently caused him financial hardship. He and his wife attended the funeral of Queen Ludwika in Krak√≥w in 1667, and attended the Diet of 1668 where King John II Casimir announced that he would abdicate. In 1668 he went to Warsaw for the Diet that would elect the next King of Poland and later attended the coronation of King Micha≈Ç I. From 1670 onwards he dealt with the shipments of grain from his leaseholds at Olsz√≥wka, Mi≈Çawczyce, Skrzypi√≥w and Smogorz√≥w in Lesser Poland down the River Vistula to Gda≈Ñsk. In 1672 he was involved in raiding parties sent to harass the invading Turks and Tatars, before taking part in the Diet of 1672 in Lublin. He participated in the 1674 election of King Jan Sobieski and attended the joint burial of the late Kings Kazimierz and Micha≈Ç and the coronation of Sobieski in Krak√≥w in 1676. His later years were spent fending off lawsuits that arose from his various excesses and conflicts with neighbours which eventually resulted in him being exiled, however, the sentence was never enforced. Pasek died on 1 August 1701 in the village of Niedzieliska, Lesser Poland Voivodeship the year after the death of his wife and he was buried in Budziszewice,_≈Å√≥d≈∫_VoivodeshipBudziszewice] near to his birthplace. Literary output Towards the end of his life (around 1690-1695) Pasek wrote an autobiographical diary, Pamietniki, a copy of which was found in 18th century with extracts printed in 1821 and a full work published in 1836 by Edward Raczy≈Ñski, making him posthumously famous. Since a number of opening pages of the first part and the final pages of the last part are missing, it is now impossible to establish when Pasek begins and ends his story. Furthermore, as he wrote the diary many years after these conflicts, he frequently mistook some historic events and incorporated incorrect dates into the text. However, there a numerous authentic details contained within the memoirs particularly from his military service and a collection of letters from the Kings and other nobles whom he served. The diary is divided into two parts. The first part covers the years 1655‚Äì1666, describing wars with the Swedish Empire (Swedish invasion of Poland), Transylvania, Muscovy (Russo- Polish War (1654‚Äì67)) and Lubomirski's Rebellion. Pasek also describes the Polish army raid over Denmark (1658‚Äì1659). Altogether, Pasek fought in large parts of Europe, from Smolensk to Jutland, and from Gda≈Ñsk to Vienna. The second part of the book covers the years 1667‚Äì1688, when Pasek settled down in his village near Krak√≥w in Lesser Poland. He describes his peacetime activities, conveniently missing some compromising facts, such as court orders, sentencing him to infamia. He did not object serfdom and peasant social class oppression. Representative of the late Sarmatism culture, he viewed the Szlachta as the only real representatives of Poland, but even then he invariably unfavourably described the actions of Lithuanian and Cossack nobles and neither did he spare Polish nobles from rebuke. In his memoirs he depicts in vivid language the everyday life of a Polish noble (Szlachcic), during both war and peace. He appears to have written as he would have spoken, and it is this language and attitude which has been highlighted as his contribution to Polish literature (later inspiring the language written by Sienkiewicz for his characters in the Trilogy) and has made his memoirs considered to be the most interesting and entertaining Polish memoirs of the age. He commented on everything from the fashions of the time, the outcomes of duels and squabbles amongst the Szlachta, the passing of the seasons, the profitability of leaseholds and quality of harvests, domestic and international politics, as well as providing valuable descriptions of the battles he was involved in and of warfare at the time. His contemporary Jesuit education is evidenced by his use of classical and mythological rhetoric and his abundant use of Latin phrases within his writings. His memoirs outline his attitude to the politics of the era. Himself devotedly loyal to Poland and to his country's King, but despairing at the situation the Commonwealth found itself in, the way the army conducted itself, and how successive treaties, rebellions, invasions and civil wars weakened the country. He hated the schemes of Archbishop Pra≈ºmowski ('the one eyed bishop who saw only evil') and Queen Ludwika to place a Frenchman on the throne of Poland, and rejoiced when the Diet elected Micha≈Ç Wi≈õniowiecki and subsequently Jan Sobieski as King ('Vivat Piast') and recognised the problems that electing foreign Kings posed to the security and politics of the Commonwealth. While supportive of King John II Casimir (1648‚Äì68) he nerveless criticises the King's own role in the catastrophic last years of his reign. He is favourable of the actions of the largely incompetent rule of King Michael Korybut (1669‚Äì73), and concludes his narrative with splendid descriptions of the reign of King John III Sobieski (1674‚Äì96) and a vivid second-hand account of actions of the Polish army at the Siege of Vienna and their subsequent actions in Hungary. He mentions his own role in the Swedish and Muscovite wars and the politics surrounding them and writes colourfully about the military life, showing soldiers primary motivations, like curiosity, desire of fame and loot. Illustration of a meeting of the Sejm described by Pasek A devout Catholic, Pasek attributed many of the events he sees and the fortunes of the Commonwealth and its Hetmans to the 'Will of God'. He is a great believer in piety stating that God gave Czarniecki his victories as he devoted them to God and his King rather than taking credit for them himself. Despite this Pasek, by his own admission, frequently gets into quarrels with others, and shows disregard for non- Catholic Christian denominations; for example, he describes Polish soldiers stealing prayer books from faithful Danes during a service at a Lutheran church in Denmark, and the highlights rejection of Protestant souls from heaven as retribution by St. Peter for their desecration of Polish churches after an explosion at a besieged Swedish occupied castle threw the remaining defenders into the air before they fell into the nearby river. The memoirs provide many vivid details of Pasek's personal life. He offers wearied advice on marriage in light of his troubles after his marrying a widow with five step-daughters, and advises young men to take every chance they can to participate in local Diets in order to learn etiquette, law and politics. He details the many fights, duels and arguments that he is involved in, and gives a description of a theatrical performance in Warsaw in 1664 which descended into a massacre of the actors after one of his fellow fully-armed Szlachta mistakes an actor for the actual Emperor of Austria. He describes arguments during the Diets, his altercation with Ivan Mazepa which allegedly left Mazepa in tears, and his and his relations romantic lives. At one point in his later years he successfully trains an otter as a pet which will bring him fish from any river or pond on command, and goes hunting accompanied by a menagerie of hunting dogs, a fox, a martin, a badger, a hawk and a raven, all with a hare with bells on hopping behind him. Pasek utilised different genres in his writing, such as: * lyric poetry (in a farewell to his beloved horse Deresz) * panegyrics (describing the victory in the Battle of Vienna and the Battle of Basya) * letters of King John II Casimir and Hetman Stefan Czarniecki * speeches and dialogues * popular songs of the era * satirical metaphors (describing the Hungarian invasion as an attempt to sate an appetite for garlic) * offensive jokes and mockery of almost all non-Poles (and may of his fellow Szlachta) * everyday language and swear words Pasek's Pamiƒôtniki are frequently compared to that of Samuel Pepys Diary though Pepys diary is more detailed and takes place over ten years in high Offices, Pasek's memoirs take place over thirty two years and are far broader and more down-to-earth in scope. However, there are significant difference between the experiences of the contemporaneous English aristocracy and the Commonwealth Szlachta in terms of what life was like and what 'nobility' meant. Other comparisons within English Literature have also been made with the works of Samuel Johnson and James Boswell In 1896 the part of Pasek's memoirs that describes the Polish army campaign in Denmark was translated to Danish by Stanis≈Çaw Rosznecki and published as the book (The Poles in Denmark 1659).  Cultural references  His diary has sometimes been called the ‚ÄúEpos of Sarmatian Poland‚Äù, and inspired a number of 19th and 20th century Polish writers, such as Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz S≈Çowacki, Henryk Sienkiewicz, Teodor Jeske-Choi≈Ñski, Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski, J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski and Witold Gombrowicz. Adam Mickiewicz devoted two of his lectures on Slavic literature to him; Juliusz S≈Çowacki used his figure in \\"Mazepie\\", where the author of 'Memoirs' on the porch, 'With a serious parrot': \\"And he stood with a large piece of paper - well! he's a lovely speaker, he prepared a macaroon poem for the king.\\" Henryk Sienkiewicz made extensive use of the Pasek's vocabulary and most likely took the title of the first volume of his \\"Trilogy\\" (With Fire and Sword) from a line in Pasek's memoirs: \\"[the enemy] plundered three parts of our homeland with sword and fire ...\\" ([wr√≥g] trzy czƒô≈õci ojczyzny naszej mieczem i ogniem splƒÖdrowa≈Ç...). His works inspired others including Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski, J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski, Zygmunt Kaczkowski, Teodor Jeske-Choi≈Ñski, and Henryk Rzewuski, who wrote a series of 'noble's' tales' published as \\"Memoirs of Soplica\\". Pasek's influence is also visible in the literature of the 20th century, e.g. in poetry Jerzy Harasymowicz, Ernest Bryll, in the novel \\"Trans- Atlantyk\\" (1953) Witold Gombrowicz (a parody of a noble's tales), in the stories of the author of \\"Szczeniƒôcych lat\\" Melchior Wa≈Ñkowicz, and in the work of Ksawery Pruszy≈Ñski and Wojciech ≈ªukrowski. Numerous references to Pasek's diaries show the inspirational roots of Polish artists in the national culture of the 17th-century Commonwealth.

The population of the civil parish at the 2001 census was 81.Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Rutland Retrieved 2009-08-20 This remained less than 100 at the 2011 census and was included in the town of Stamford. In the 13th century Pickworth was quite a substantial village, but by the end of the 14th century it was almost non-existent. It now comprises a small parish church, a disused Methodist chapel, a few large houses and a couple of rows of terraced and council houses. It lies in a landscape characterised by Rutland County Council as the clay woodlands of the Rutland Plateau (a Jurassic limestone plateau). At the southern boundary of the village is a crossroads leading to Great Casterton about to the south, the A1 road at Tickencote Warren to the west, Lincolnshire Gate and Castle Bytham to the north and an unmaintained track to Ryhall Heath to the east. All Saints' church The current church, All Saints, was built in 1821 and lies to the west of the village. The church is a Grade II listed building. Maps previously showed the spire of the demolished church under the name Mockbeggar to the west of the current village site. The remains of the old medieval village lie mainly to the west of the current village centre in an area referred to as Top Pickworth. The only visible remains, other than earthworks, is a stone arch. Just to the west of the village lie the remains of a lime kiln. In 1817 this was the workplace of local poet John Clare. About south-east is Walk Farm, formerly known as Walkherd Lodge, which was the home of Martha \\"Patty\\" Turner, who became John Clare's wife. Both the lime kiln and Walk Farm featured in a television documentary that was made about the poet in the late 1960s. About to the west of the village is the site of the Battle of Losecote Field in 1470. It has been claimed that the village was depopulated as a result of the fighting.

It is a new design, written from scratch, separate from the XMMS codebase. While Peter Alm, one of the original authors of XMMS, was responsible for the initial design and coding of XMMS2 (late 2002 to early 2003),Project history , XMMS2 Project, retrieved January 11, 2007 he has since passed on the responsibility of furthering the project to Tobias Rundstr√∂m and Anders Gustafsson.Lead Developers , XMMS2 Project, retrieved January 11, 2007 LXMusic, the default music player application in LXDE, is an XMMS2 client. Design concepts XMMS2 borrows concepts from XMMS-era music players, such as playback control, a playlist, plugins, user-configurable GUI, and adds features such as a media library and a client‚Äìserver design. Like XMMS, XMMS2 has a plugin architecture; a type of modular architecture where certain functions are delegated to loadable libraries which provide particular functions at run-time. XMMS recognised five different types of plugins: * Input plugins for reading and decoding files or streams. * Output plugins to handle sound output. * Effects plugins to add effects to decoded audio data, before being output. * Visualisation plugins to provide visual animations that vary according to the audio being played. * General plugins which allow for miscellaneous functions such as controlling XMMS via an Infrared remote control or a Joystick. XMMS2 also recognises five types of plugins, but they perform rather different functions: * Transport plugins for reading files or streams. * Decoder plugins for decoding data read by transport plugins. * Effect plugins to add effects to decoded audio data, before being output. * Output plugins to handle sound output. * Playlist plugins to handle the importing and exporting of playlist data. Unlike XMMS2, XMMS had no library where it stored information about a user's media collection. The only media resources XMMS knew about were its playlist. Starting in around 2000, players like Winamp and SoundJam MP began implementing simple database features that allow the player to \\"remember\\" where a user's media is located, as well as caching metadata stored in the files such as artist, title, date added and play count. XMMS2's media library is well integrated with the playlist. This integration means that every file or stream added to the playlist has its metadata automatically cached by the media library. This only happens once for every unique URL, so metadata isn't read again if it already exists in the library. Besides metadata, the media library can also quickly and efficiently store and reload playlists, making a user's music collection all accessible from a single place. One feature of XMMS2 that has been rarely implemented in media players is its client-server architecture. XMMS2 allows the user to choose from a number of interface implementations for searching, selecting and playing media, then to close the interface while the audio plays \\"in the background\\". The interface can be reopened at any time for further use. Other players with similar features on *nix include the Music Player Daemon and Music on Console. The design When first conceived, XMMS2 was simply a shared library. That is, XMMS2 would be back end code to take care of the mechanics of decoding and playing audio streams, requiring to be linked into a compiled program that provided a user interface. This concept was later expanded into a client‚Äìserver model to allow for more flexible coupling between the front-end and the back-end.Design of XMMS2 , XMMS2 Project, retrieved January 11, 2007 The advantages of this approach are: * This allows any compatible client(s) to connect to and control a single instance of the XMMS2 daemon. ** Clients can offer various types of user interfaces ‚Äì graphical or text based, implemented using various toolkits, integrated with various desktop environments. ** Client developers can concentrate on improving the usability of their interface, and not worry about playback code. * The use of TCP sockets also allows for users to remotely control XMMS2 daemons over a TCP/IP network. While the plugin architecture of XMMS allowed it to be quite extensible, it was inefficient in certain ways; XMMS2 seeks to improve on that. * XMMS has Input plugins that take care of reading data and decoding it to audio. XMMS2 splits this into a Transport stage and a Decode stage, so that a single transport plugin may supply data of any type to any decoder plugin (such as an HTTP plugin reading mp3 data from a web site). * General plugins may prove to be less relevant in XMMS2, as their purpose may be served by standalone clients, but the plugin architecture will still exist. * XMMS can't handle container formats in a general manner. The XMMS2 architecture makes it easier to build support for container formats. XMMS2 and other projects The name \\"XMMS2\\" was chosen by Peter Alm and Tobias Rundstr√∂m as they started work on the project, evidently intending it to become the successor to XMMS. However, other developers started using the name (in 2003) before Peter and Tobias ever released their code: * Another project named XMMS2, was described as \\"a Gtk 2 port of the well known xmms.\\" This was not related to the project discussed in the rest of this article. The project has now been discontinued and removed from GNU Savannah. * A better known GTK+ 2 port of XMMS is the Beep Media Player, which is sometimes referred to (erroneously) as XMMS2.'Another one.' by Thomas Nilsson, 2003-11-08, retrieved January 11, 2007 The BMP FAQ explains that project's relationship to XMMS. A subtle difference between the XMMS and XMMS2 acronyms is that, while XMMS stands for X (originally for X11 then Cross-platform) MultiMedia System, XMMS2 stands for X(Cross-platform) music multiplexing system. This decision was made to make it clear that XMMS2 would only ever be an audio player, and not a general multimedia player with video support.

Space launch involves liftoff, when a rocket or other space launch vehicle leaves the ground, floating ship or midair aircraft at the start of a flight. Liftoff is of two main types: rocket launch (the current conventional method), and non- rocket spacelaunch (where other forms of propulsion are employed, including airbreathing jet engines or other kinds). Issues with reaching space=Definition of space Space has no physical edge to it as the atmospheric pressure gradually reduces with altitude; instead, the edge of space is defined by convention, often the K√°rm√°n line of 100 km. Other definitions have been created as well. In the US for example space has been defined as 50 miles. Energy Therefore, by definition for spaceflight to occur, sufficient altitude is necessary. This implies a minimum gravitational potential energy needs to be overcome: for the K√°rm√°n line this is approximately 1 MJ/kg. W=mgh, m=1 kg, g=9.82 m/s2, h=105m. W=1*9.82*105‚âà106J/kg=1MJ/kg In practice, a higher energy than this is needed to be expended due to losses such as airdrag, propulsive efficiency, cycle efficiency of engines that are employed and gravity drag. In the past fifty years spaceflight has usually meant remaining in space for a period of time, rather than going up and immediately falling back to earth. This entails orbit, which is mostly a matter of velocity, not altitude, although that does not mean air friction and relevant altitudes in relation to that and orbit don't have to be taken into account. At much, much higher altitudes than many orbital ones maintained by satellites, altitude begins to become a larger and larger factor and speed a lesser one. At lower altitudes, due to the high speed required to remain in orbit, air friction is a very important consideration affecting satellites, much more than in the popular image of space. At even lower altitudes, balloons, with no forward velocity, can serve many of the roles satellites play. G-forces Many cargoes, particularly humans have a limiting g-force that they can survive. For humans this is about 3-6 g. Some launchers such as gun launchers would give accelerations in the hundred or thousands of g and thus are completely unsuitable. Reliability Launchers vary with respect to their reliability for achieving the mission. Safety Safety is the probability of causing injury or loss of life. Unreliable launchers are not necessarily unsafe, whereas reliable launchers are usually, but not invariably safe. Apart from catastrophic failure of the launch vehicle itself other safety hazards include depressurisation, and the Van Allen radiation belts which preclude orbits which spend long periods within them. Trajectory optimisation Trajectory optimization is the process of designing a trajectory that minimizes or maximizes some measure of performance within prescribed constraint boundaries. While not exactly the same, the goal of solving a trajectory optimization problem is essentially the same as solving an optimal control problem. This problem was first studied by Robert H. Goddard and is also known as the Goddard problem. The selection of flight profiles that yield the greatest performance plays a substantial role in the preliminary design of flight vehicles, since the use of ad-hoc profile or control policies to evaluate competing configurations may inappropriately penalize the performance of one configuration over another. Thus, to guarantee the selection of the best vehicle design, it is important to optimize the profile and control policy for each configuration early in the design process. For example, for tactical missiles, the flight profiles are determined by the thrust and load factor (lift) histories. These histories can be controlled by a number of means including such techniques as using an angle of attack command history or an altitude/downrange schedule that the missile must follow. Each combination of missile design factors, desired missile performance, and system constraints results in a new set of optimal control parameters.Phillips, C.A, \\"Energy Management for a Multiple Pulse Missile\\", AIAA Paper 88-0334, Jan., 1988 Carbon emissions Many rockets use fossil fuels. A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket for instance burns through 400 metric tons of kerosene and emits more carbon dioxide in a few minutes than an average car would in more than two centuries. As the number of rocket launches is expected to increase heavily in the coming years, the effect that launching into orbit has on Earth is expected to get much worse. Some rocket manufacturers (i.e. Orbex, ArianeGroup) are using different launch fuels (such as bio-propane,methane produced from biomass, ...).Can we get to space without damaging the Earth through huge carbon emissions Blue Origin's BE-3 uses liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen and BE-7 uses hydrogen and oxygen propellants in a dual-expander combustion cycle. Sustained spaceflight=Suborbital launch Sub- orbital space flight is any space launch that reaches space without doing a full orbit around the planet, and requires a maximum speed of around 1 km/s just to reach space, and up to 7 km/s for longer distance such as an intercontinental space flight. An example of a sub-orbital flight would be a ballistic missile, or future tourist flight such as Virgin Galactic, or an intercontinental transport flight like SpaceLiner. Any space launch without an orbit-optimization correction to achieve a stable orbit will result in a suborbital space flight, unless there is sufficient thrust to leave orbit completely. (See Space gun#Getting to orbit) Orbital launch In addition, if orbit is required, then a much greater amount of energy must be generated in order to give the craft some sideways speed. The speed that must be achieved depends on the altitude of the orbit ‚Äì less speed is needed at high altitude. However, after allowing for the extra potential energy of being at higher altitudes, overall more energy is used reaching higher orbits than lower ones. The speed needed to maintain an orbit near the Earth's surface corresponds to a sideways speed of about 7.8 km/s (17,400 mph), an energy of about 30MJ/kg. This is several times the energy per kg of practical rocket propellant mixes. Gaining the kinetic energy is awkward as the airdrag tends to slow the spacecraft, so rocket-powered spacecraft generally fly a compromise trajectory that leaves the thickest part of the atmosphere very early on, and then fly on for example, a Hohmann transfer orbit to reach the particular orbit that is required. This minimises the airdrag as well as minimising the time that the vehicle spends holding itself up. Airdrag is a significant issue with essentially all proposed and current launch systems, although usually less so than the difficulty of obtaining enough kinetic energy to simply reach orbit at all. Escape velocity If the Earth's gravity is to be overcome entirely then sufficient energy must be obtained by a spacecraft to exceed the depth of the gravity potential energy well. Once this has occurred, provided the energy is not lost in any non-conservative way, then the vehicle will leave the influence of the Earth. The depth of the potential well depends on the vehicle's position, and the energy depends on the vehicle's speed. If the kinetic energy exceeds the potential energy then escape occurs. At the Earth's surface this occurs at a speed of 11.2 km/s (25,000 mph), but in practice a much higher speed is needed due to airdrag. Types of space launch=Rocket launch Rocket launch is the only current way to reach space. In some cases an airbreathing (jet engine) first stage has been used as well. Non-rocket launch Non-rocket space launch is a launch into space where some or all of the needed speed and altitude are provided by something other than expendable rockets. A number of alternatives to expendable rockets have been proposed. In some systems such as Skyhooks, rocket sled launch, and air launch, a rocket is used to reach orbit, but it is only part of the system.

In first-class cricket, he played as an amateur, mainly for Cambridge University and Sussex, and captained the latter team between 1922 and 1929. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower order batsman, Gilligan completed the double in 1923 and was one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for 1924. When his playing career ended, he held several important positions in cricket, including that of England selector and president of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A popular figure within cricket, he was widely regarded as sporting and friendly. During his playing days, Gilligan was a member of the British Fascists. He came to the notice of the Australian secret service during the 1924‚Äì25 MCC tour, and it is possible he helped to establish small fascist groups in Australia. It is unknown how long he remained a member, but the organisation practically ceased to exist by 1926. Gilligan played cricket for Dulwich College before the First World War, then for Cambridge, twice winning his blue. He briefly played county cricket for Surrey but moved to Sussex in 1920. Following a slow start to his county career, he rapidly improved and in partnership with Maurice Tate established a formidable bowling reputation. First playing for England in 1922, he was appointed Test captain in 1924. In the latter year, Gilligan was at the height of his form when he suffered a blow to his heart while batting. The strain affected his bowling, which was never again as effective, but he still captained England in Australia during the 1924‚Äì25 season. The series was lost, but both he and his team were popular and respected. In following years, he played less frequently; he resigned as Sussex captain in 1929 and retired three years later. He subsequently became a writer, journalist and cricket commentator while maintaining his connections with Sussex. As a captain, Gilligan was well-liked by players and commentators, although many did not believe he was an effective tactician. Nevertheless, under his leadership, Sussex became an attractive, competitive team. He encouraged the search for young talent, and the players consequently discovered became the backbone of the club into the 1930s. As a fielder, he inspired his teams to become good fielding sides. In addition, as MCC captain of a team which toured India in 1926‚Äì27, he encouraged Indians to take responsibility for their own cricket board instead of allowing white Englishmen to run Indian cricket, and lobbied the MCC to bestow Test match status on the Indian team. As MCC president, he played a part in the D'Oliveira affair in 1968. He died in 1976, aged 81. Early life Gilligan was born in Denmark Hill, an area of Camberwell in London. He was the second of four children born to Willie Austin Gilligan and Alice Eliza Kimpton; his brothers Frank and Harold also played high-level cricket. The family had a strong connection with Sussex; Gilligan followed Sussex County Cricket Club as a child, and later played club cricket there. After attending Fairfield School, he was educated at Dulwich College from 1906 until 1914 where he established a sporting reputation in athletics and cricket. In the latter sport, he played in the school first eleven, as did his brothers; in 1913, all three boys played in the team. Gilligan played in the eleven between 1911 and 1914 and captained the side in his final two years. In 1914, he topped the school's batting and bowling averages. Selected to play representative schools cricket at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1914, he took ten wickets in total and scored one fifty in the two matches. By the standards of school cricket, his pace was impressive, and Surrey invited him to play for their second eleven during the school holidays of 1913 and 1914; his father was a member of that county's committee, and Gilligan qualified to play through his London birth.Lee, p. 147. In 1914, Gilligan entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, but his life at the university was interrupted by the First World War. He fought in France with the Lancashire Fusiliers from 1915, serving as Captain in the 11th battalion. When the war ended, Gilligan returned to Pembroke and resumed his cricket career. Cricket at Cambridge Following the war, Cambridge University suffered from a lack of quality bowling at the start of the 1919 cricket season. Consequently, Gilligan faced little competition for his place in the team and took 32 wickets at an average of under 27 in Cambridge matches, which critics considered a poor return. He made a bigger impression when, batting at number eleven in the order, he scored 101 against Sussex and shared a last-wicket partnership of 177 in 65 minutes with John Naumann. A few days later, Gilligan won his blue‚Äîthe awarding of the Cambridge \\"colours\\" to sportsmen‚Äîby appearing in the University Match against Oxford. On the last day of the three-day match, he took five wickets for 16 runs in 57 deliveries to finish with bowling figures of six for 52 (six wickets taken for 52 runs conceded). According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, this was the best bowling performance in the University Match for many years, although Cambridge lost the match. Towards the end of the season, Gilligan played three first-class matches for Surrey and made a further appearance in a festival game, although he accomplished little with bat or ball. In all first-class games in 1919, he scored 231 runs at a batting average of 17.76 and took 35 wickets at 31.57. At the end of the season, he changed counties; his family connections in the area, and the presence of his brother Harold in the team, led him to register with Sussex.Lee, pp. 147‚Äì48. Gilligan retained his position in the Cambridge team in 1920 and once more played against Oxford. In the University Match, he was ineffective with the ball as the damp conditions did not suit his style of bowling. At the end of the Cambridge term, Gilligan, playing as an amateur, made his Sussex debut. The Times later commented that in 1920, Gilligan was \\"known as a fast but unreliable bowler, a dashing and vulnerable batsman and a mid-off without his equal in England\\". Wisden commented on his 1920 performance: \\"[He] remained stationary, doing nothing out of the common either as bowler or batsman for Cambridge, and proving a decidedly expensive bowler for Sussex\\". In all first- class cricket, he scored 624 runs at an average of 17.33 and took 81 wickets at 23.55. Subsequently, Gilligan left Cambridge and joined Gilbert Kimpton & Co., a general produce merchant in London in which his father was a senior partner. Sussex cricketer Gilligan played for Sussex throughout the 1921 season and according to Wisden \\"made a distinct advance\\". His batting record was similar to the previous season, although he increased his number of wickets in the season to 90 at an average of 30.64. Wisden notes that his bowling was not statistically good, but that his biggest impact came in fielding, which was \\"brilliant in the extreme. He was described on all hands as the best mid-off in England.\\" In 1922, Gilligan assumed the Sussex captaincy from Herbert Wilson. The team's results were not impressive, but Wisden said that the team were attractive to watch and excelled in fielding, in which Gilligan led by example. Gilligan later recalled that he received great support from George Cox, the senior professional in the team.Marshall, p. 73. Personally, Gilligan had his best season to date with bat and ball; he scored 916 runs and took 135 wickets at an average of 18.75. Based on his good form, he was selected in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. Appearing for the Gentlemen, a team of amateurs, his fielding in particular impressed commentators. He was selected in a further representative match, when he played for the \\"Rest of England\\" against Yorkshire, the County Champions. In the latter game, he took eight wickets in total. At the end of the season, Gilligan was included in the MCC team to tour South Africa and play a Test series. On the tour of South Africa, MCC were led by Frank Mann. Gilligan was appointed as vice-captain in preference to Percy Fender, who was much admired as a captain but not popular with the cricket authorities.Marshall, pp. 104‚Äì05. Gilligan played in two of the five Tests, the first and last. His Test debut came on 23 December 1922 in a match which England lost. The team were more successful during his second appearance; he took six wickets in the match, and his batting at a crucial stage of the match‚Äîhe scored 39 not out in the second innings‚Äîwas vital in a victory which gave the series to England 2‚Äì1. In total, Gilligan took nine Test wickets at 22.37, and in all first-class games, captured 26 wickets at an average of 22.03. During 1923, after returning to England, Gilligan had his best season in county cricket. He took 163 wickets at 17.50 and scored 1,183 runs at an average of 21.12 to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season for the only time in his career. With Maurice Tate, whose emergence as a pace bowler was encouraged by Gilligan,Lee, p. 150. he established a bowling partnership which proved effective over the following two seasons. Gilligan scored two centuries and nine times took five or more wickets in an innings. As a result of his performances, he was named as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation noted that he was now \\"among the leading amateur cricketers of the day\\", and was likely to play for England again. It concluded: \\"It is not claimed for Arthur Gilligan, by even his warmest admirers, that he can be classed among great fast bowlers, but he is a very good one, combining with the right temperament and tireless energy just the extra bit of pace that to many batsmen is so distasteful.\\" England captain Gilligan (right) is tossing a coin at the first Test at Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 14 June 1924. South African captain Herbie Taylor is watching Following heavy losses to Australia in two Test series immediately following the war, the England selectors needed to appoint a new captain. Frank Mann led the team during the tour of South Africa, the team's only Tests between 1921 and 1924. According to the cricket writer Alan Gibson, Mann was slightly too old to be a realistic candidate and his batting was not quite of the required standard. Other possibilities early in the season included Fender and Arthur Carr. Instead, the selectors appointed Gilligan as captain for the 1924 series against South Africa, in an attempt to assess whether he possessed the playing ability to justify his selection in the role.Gibson, pp. 123‚Äì24. Cricket journalist E. W. Swanton writes that Gilligan was the favoured candidate of the influential Lord Harris, which may have assisted his appointment.Swanton, p. 142. Gibson describes Gilligan at the time as \\"29 years old, an attractive, smiling personality\\".Gibson, p. 124. Gilligan began the season very well. He and Tate, in the weeks approaching the first Test, established a reputation as the best opening bowlers in the world. At the time, the best batting teams in England were Surrey and Middlesex; in consecutive matches, Gilligan and Tate dismissed these sides for 53 and 41, respectively. In the latter game, Gilligan took eight for 25, and he and Tate bowled several county sides out for low scores. In the first Test match, on Gilligan's debut as England captain, the pair bowled South Africa out for 30 runs. Gilligan took six wickets for seven runs, and Wisden reported that, \\"He bowled very fast and with any amount of fire.\\". When South Africa followed-on, he took five for 83, to finish the game with 11 wickets. England won the second Test, like the first, by an innings; Gilligan took five wickets in the game, and by the end of June had 74 wickets in all first-class matches at an average of 15. At this stage, the press and public had great expectations of success for Gilligan and Tate on the forthcoming tour of Australia. At the beginning of July, Gilligan played for the Gentlemen against the Players at the Oval. In the first innings, he was struck heavily over his heart by a delivery from Frederick Pearson;Lee, p. 151. it was obvious that he was hurt, and he was out shortly afterwards. Although the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval was less prestigious than its Lord's counterpart, and generally mattered less to participants, Gilligan chose to bat the next day despite his injury and scored a century batting at number 10. Even so, the Gentlemen lost the game by six wickets. Gilligan was never again as effective a cricketer, and he later conceded that batting in the second innings was a mistake. It is likely that the strain of the innings did as much harm as the original blow, although Gibson later wrote that Gilligan's subsequent long life suggests that he was not too badly hurt, and that it is unlikely too much damage was done. Nevertheless, Gibson concludes \\"there is no doubt that he was badly shaken up, and whatever the reason, the magic departed\\". Gilligan played in the next Test match, without much success, and for the Gentlemen at Lord's. The effects of the injury then forced him to rest in the following weeks, and he missed the fourth Test. When he returned for the final Test, he did not take any wickets and finished the Test series with 17 wickets at an average of 18.94, placing him second in the England bowling averages behind Tate. He batted just three times in the series, scoring 77 runs at 25.66. England won the series 3‚Äì0, and although South Africa had not proved to be a strong team, several England players‚Äîincluding Gilligan‚Äîhad impressed commentators. Gilligan continued to take wickets in the latter stages of the season, but was less successful than before his injury. At the end of the season, he had 103 wickets at 19.36 and 864 runs at 21.07. By mid-July, Gilligan had been named as captain of the MCC team to tour Australia at the end of the English cricket season and was expected to be one of the leading bowlers. He had, however, faced some criticism of his captaincy. After being underused in the first Test, Cec Parkin wrote an article highly critical of Gilligan which appeared in the press; Parkin never played for England again. Additionally, while Gilligan was generally popular for his cheerful and friendly approach, the press judged Fender to be the better captain. However, the cricket authorities at Lord's disapproved of Fender's unconventional tactics and approach.McKinstry, p. 226. Journalists later revealed that, at some point in the season, the selectors had first asked Frank Mann to captain, but he was unable to accept the invitation.Streeton, p. 138. Tour of Australia=On the field Gilligan (third from left) is leading the England team onto the Melbourne Cricket Ground at the Australian second innings during the fourth Test on 18 February 1925. Following his injury in 1924, Gilligan could no longer bowl fast and, as a player, had little influence on the 1924‚Äì25 tour of Australia; his performances were hampered by further injuries.Gibson, p. 125. His best bowling figures of four for 12 came in the opening match and his only century came in the second game; he passed fifty just once more on the tour. His leadership proved influential in one main respect. In previous series, Australia had been superior to England in the field, but according to Gibson, Gilligan \\"revolutionized the English fielding, a department in which they began to compare with Australia, for the first time since the war and possibly since the early 1900s. This had much effect on the England sides of the next few years\\". However an Australian newspaper estimated that England dropped 21 catches in the five Tests, which may have impacted on the series result; Australia won 4‚Äì1.McKinstry, p. 227. Other aspects of Gilligan's leadership were less successful; his captaincy lacked tactical sophistication, and the Australian captain Herbie Collins proved superior in this respect. According to Gibson, critics claimed that Gilligan \\"was too easygoing on the finer points of law\\". In addition, his inexperience led to defeat in one warm-up match that the MCC could have drawn, and commentators dismissed him as naive and easy-going on the field. However, he was immensely popular with the Australian public and well-liked by his team. Gibson, writing in 1979, noted that Gilligan \\"was, and is, one of the most popular captains England have sent to Australia\\". During the tour, Gilligan was the focus of a great deal of publicity. The periodical Cricket described him as \\"'one of the most jovial personalities imaginable\\", while former Australian Test captain Monty Noble wrote that Gilligan was the \\"type of man who, in the most unostentatious way, can do more than all the politicians and statesmen to cement the relations between the Homeland and the Dominions\\".Moore, p. 166. According to Noble, his sportsmanship, including his grace and cheerfulness in defeat, made him a perfect English gentleman and an \\"Empire builder\\". After Australia won the first two Tests, Parkin, writing in England, once more criticised Gilligan's leadership in the press and provoked a minor controversy by suggesting that Jack Hobbs should assume the captaincy.McKinstry, pp. 234‚Äì36. The third Test was much closer, although England were severely hampered by injuries to three bowlers, including Gilligan himself. These injuries may have affected the outcome of the series. Australia won by the small margin of 11 runs, though Gilligan helped to take his team close to victory with a restrained innings of 31.McKinstry, p. 237. England won the fourth Test, their first victory over Australia since the war but lost the final game.Gibson, p. 126. Critics judged that the team played well and did not suffer disgrace, despite the result. Gibson notes that the tour \\"was successful in everything but victory, and this was sensed by the English public, who assembled in large numbers to welcome the side home\\". In the Test series, Gilligan took 10 wickets at an average of 51.90 and scored 64 runs at 9.14. Gibson judges that most of his wickets were good batsmen, and many bowlers had poor figures in a series that produced a large number of runs, so this record is not as poor as it appears. In all first-class games on tour, Gilligan took 28 wickets at 38.39 and scored 357 runs at 17.85. He did not play in any more Tests. Gilligan (second from the left) and Frederick Toone (extreme right) were presented with silver trays at the end of the 1924‚Äì25 tour in appreciation of the MCC team's sportsmanship. Political concerns The MCC tour took place against a background of social disturbance in Australia. There were concerns within Australian society over the growing influence of communism and, according to the historian Andrew Moore, some commentators hoped that the tour would help to ease tension.Moore, p. 165. It was expected that Gilligan's influence and popularity would further assist this process. However, during the tour, the Commonwealth Investigative Branch were informed by the London authorities that Gilligan and the MCC tour manager Frederick Toone were members of the British Fascists. Although the organisation never achieved the same level of influence in Britain as the British Union of Fascists, which formed in 1932, the British Fascists were popular for a short time during the mid-1920s.Moore, pp. 166‚Äì69. The primary focus of the organisation was to oppose communism, but MI5 considered its threat serious enough to warrant placing leading members under surveillance. In addition, the British Foreign Office were aware that the British Fascists had established some links overseas.Moore, p. 167. Moore suggests that it is possible that Gilligan and Toone used the tour as an opportunity to establish links in Australia. The team visited many parts of Australia and attended many social events which presented an opportunity to discuss politics. Shortly after the tour's conclusion, the Commonwealth Investigative Branch uncovered evidence that the British Fascists had established chapters in several Australian cities, although they did not know how this had happened. Moore believes that \\"it may be totally coincidental that the Australian chapter of the British Fascists was established so soon after the MCC tour\\", but is more likely that Gilligan and Toone brought Fascist literature to Australia for distribution.Moore, p. 169. However, Moore writes that \\"the British Fascists' Australian operations were small beer indeed\\" and of little consequence. Gilligan gave further evidence of his political beliefs at the conclusion of the tour, when he wrote an article called \\"The Spirit of Fascism and Cricket Tours\\" for The Bulletin, a publication of the British Fascists. He wrote: \\"In ... cricket tours it is essential to work solely on the lines of Fascism, i.e. the team must be good friends and out for one thing, and one thing only, namely the good of the side, and not for any self-glory.\\"Quoted in Moore, p. 167. Moore judges that the article was neither well written nor particularly persuasive, but notes that other writers at the time made the connection between sport, cricket, the ideology of the British Empire and Fascism.Moore, p. 168. There is no evidence to say how long Gilligan maintained his connection with the British Fascists after the tour, nor if he did so at all. By 1926, the organisation had split and faded from view.Moore, p. 170. Remaining cricket career=Restricted by injury A recurrence of the effects of his injury in 1924 restricted Gilligan's cricket in 1925. Appearing in fewer games and bowling far less frequently than in previous seasons, he scored 542 runs at 15.05 and took only eight wickets. He bowled in the first four games of the season, but in his remaining seventeen appearances played only as a batsman. In 1926, he was more successful and his performances helped Sussex to rise from thirteenth to tenth in the County Championship.Lee, pp. 154‚Äì55. Playing more games, he scored 1,037 runs at 30.50, the highest seasonal batting average of his career, and took 75 wickets at 20.74. That season, although no longer considered for a place in the England team himself, Gilligan joined the panel of Test selectors,McKinstry, p. 268. and as a consequence missed some cricket for Sussex.Lee, p. 155. He published a book on that summer's tour by Australia called Collins's Men. MCC tour of India A.E.R. Gilligan's MCC team and the Madras team when they met at Chepauk in 1927. During the winter of 1926‚Äì27, with other candidates unavailable, Gilligan was chosen to captain an MCC team which toured India; the side was not fully representative and did not play Test matches.Marshall, p. 107. In first-class games, he scored three fifties and, bowling infrequently, took ten wickets on the tour. The team, the first to tour India under the colours of the MCC, was very successful.Bose, p. 30. Gilligan left most of the day-to-day organisation to his vice-captain, Raleigh Chichester-Constable,Pawle, p. 27. and did not take his speech-making duties particularly seriously.Pawle, p. 36. He nevertheless had to deal with several issues. One of the team, Jack Parsons, refused for religious reasons to take part in matches that included Sunday play; Gilligan threatened to send him home but in the end he agreed to play on condition that he could leave early on a Sunday to attend religious services. Parsons was also openly critical of racial and social discrimination that he saw. Gilligan himself intervened at one point when the MCC professionals were excluded from some invitations in Calcutta; he told their hosts that no-one would attend the functions if the professionals were not included.Pawle, pp. 28‚Äì29. Both the sporting and social programmes for the tour were demanding, and Gilligan chose to attend most functions for fear of offending their hosts. The players were left exhausted, necessitating the use of reinforcements to their number, including the occasional use of English cricketers who were coaching in India and, in several matches, the Maharajah of Patiala, who was a member of the MCC and entitled to play for the team.Pawle, pp. 30‚Äì32. The tour was originally conceived to encourage cricket- playing Europeans living in India. But as the team was financed by the Maharajah of Patiala, it played Indian sides, rather than the European sides envisaged by the tour's organisers. Gilligan, in contrast to many Englishmen, was happy to play Indian teams and actively encouraged Indians to organise their own cricket rather than leave it up to white Englishmen.Bose, pp. 30‚Äì31. According to the cricket writer Mihir Bose, Gilligan, unlike others, \\"met Indians on terms of perfect equality\\".Bose, p. 31. He successfully encouraged the Indians to form their own cricket board and promised to make a case with the Lord's authorities for India to become a Test playing team. He did so, and in 1929 India became a member of the Imperial Cricket Conference. Bose points out that Gilligan's positive attitude towards Indians, and that of the MCC when granting India Test status, was markedly different from that of most Englishmen. In terms of the advancement of Indian cricket, Bose writes that \\"Gilligan's influence was immense\\". Final years as a cricketer Gilligan in the 1930s Gilligan continued to play for Sussex until 1932. In 1927, he scored 828 runs at 27.60 but did not bowl in the first half of the season and took just 29 wickets at 24.65. The following season, he scored 942 runs at 26.91, including his last first-class century, and took 76 wickets at 26.27. In 1929, his final season as captain, he played only 12 times; he did not score a fifty, averaged 7.22 with the bat and took four wickets. He was frequently affected by injury; his brother Harold captained Sussex in his absence and assumed the role full time in 1930.Lee, pp. 161, 164. Harold also took over as captain of an MCC team which toured New Zealand in the winter of 1929‚Äì30 when Gilligan withdrew owing to illness. Over the next three seasons, Gilligan appeared intermittently for Sussex and the MCC but scored only one fifty and took just five wickets in total in that time. His last first-class appearance was for H. D. G. Leveson Gower's team against Oxford in 1932. He played several charity games during the Second World War, including some for Sussex and the Royal Air Force. In all first-class cricket, Gilligan scored 9,140 runs at an average of 20.08 and took 868 wickets at 23.30. In 11 Test matches, he scored 209 runs at an average of 16.07 and took 36 wickets at 29.05, although 26 of these wickets came in the five Tests he played before his injury. As captain in nine Tests, he won four matches and lost four; the remaining game was drawn. Style and technique At the peak of his career, Gilligan was a fast bowler. He bowled with his arm quite low, but was very accurate; his usual strategy was to aim at the stumps or to try to induce the batsmen to edge the ball to be caught in the slips. According to his Wisden obituary, he \\"regarded it as a cardinal sin to bowl short\\". Following his injury, he could not reach his former speed and was reduced to medium pace. In this style, he continued to have some success at county level. His batting was based mainly around driving the ball. He batted low in the order, and tried to score quickly, particularly against fast bowling. Several of his centuries were scored against the most successful teams, and often in difficult situations. He excelled as a fielder; his Wisden obituary stated: \\"At mid-off he has had few rivals\\". As a captain, Gilligan was not tactically sophisticated but was adept at inspiring his players. His Sussex teams were not consistent but became attractive to watch; under Gilligan's direction the team ranked among the best fielding sides in England. The off side fielders were nicknamed the \\"ring of iron\\".Marshall, p. 72. His Wisden obituary stated: \\"In two or three seasons by his insistence on fielding and on attacking cricket and by his own superb example he raised Sussex from being nothing in particular to one of the biggest draws in England.\\" According to The Times, Gilligan's captaincy laid the foundations for the county's relative success in the 1930s. In the official history of Sussex, writer Christopher Lee suggests: \\"The ten years from 1920 to the end of Gilligan's captaincy in 1930 saw the blooding of some of the most famous names in Sussex and England cricket. Gilligan himself was a mixture of amateur brilliance and professional thoroughness which inevitably brought about criticism.\\" Gilligan also extensively coached and lectured around the county, spending time in the English winters raising the team's profile. He encouraged the search for promising young cricketers, and most of the club's professional cricketers during its successful years in the 1930s were discovered during Gilligan's drive for new talent.Lee, p. 161. Percy Fender believed that Gilligan allowed the team's professionals a greater say in Sussex's affairs than previously permitted. Fender wrote that Gilligan's teams enjoyed playing under him and that he was one of the most popular captains in county cricket. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said: \\"With him there was no sharpnesses, no petty restraints, no mathematical cricket. He won or lost plumb straight\\". Swanton wrote that \\"Gilligan was essentially a friendly man, hail-fellow-well-met, and it is hard to think that in the world of sport he ever made an enemy.\\"Swanton, pp. 141‚Äì42. Personal life Gilligan married his first wife, Cecilia Mary Matthews, in April 1921, but she successfully filed for divorce in October 1933 on the grounds of her husband's infidelity. He married again in 1934; he met his second wife, Katharine Margaret Fox, on a skiing trip. Following his retirement from cricket, Gilligan began to work in journalism. He wrote several cricket books, including a history of Sussex cricket in 1932. He became one of the first radio cricket commentators, broadcasting in Australia on the 1932‚Äì33 Ashes series and covering subsequent visits of MCC teams to Australia for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. A popular and respected commentator, he established an on-air partnership with former Australian batman Vic Richardson. In Gilligan's obituary, Wisden observed \\"Gilligan was, as may be imagined, a master of the diplomatic comment if any tiresome incident occurred\\". He was also a member of the BBC radio commentary team for Tests between 1947 and 1954. In 1955, he wrote a book, The Urn Returns, about the 1954‚Äì55 Ashes series, won by England. In England, he wrote about cricket for the News Chronicle. During the Second World War, Gilligan served in the Royal Air Force as a welfare officer; he was commissioned a pilot officer and rose to the rank of squadron leader.Lee, p. 185. When his cricket career ended, Gilligan maintained his connection with Sussex,Swanton, p. 141. of which he was later made an Honorary Life Member. He served as chairman, patron and president of the county and assisted many local clubs in the area. He gained a good reputation as a speaker and lecturer, and also developed an interest in golf in later years: he was president of the English Golf Union in 1959, captain of the County Cricketers' Golfing Society from 1952 until 1972, and president of the latter organisation until his death. An Honorary Life Member of the MCC, Gilligan served as MCC president from 1967 to 1968. During his tenure, the MCC was involved in controversy over the non-selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira in the England team on the grounds of his colour.Oborne, pp. 145‚Äì46. Gilligan, in his capacity as MCC president, was aware of this having seen a private letter which communicated the explicit threat from the South African prime minister B. J. Vorster that the forthcoming tour would be cancelled if D'Oliveira were selected. However, he and the others who saw the letter, G. O. B. Allen and Billy Griffith, respectively the MCC treasurer and secretary, kept this information to themselves.Oborne, pp. 151‚Äì55. When the English selectors met to choose the team, Gilligan, Allen and Griffith were present to represent the MCC. A BBC programme in 2004 claimed that Gilligan pressured the selectors to leave out D'Oliveira, but D'Oliveira's biographer Peter Oborne suggests that Allen carried far more influence at the meeting. He writes of Gilligan's part in the affair: \\"It would be wrong to make too much of Gilligan's embarrassing past. Given that presidents are appointed for only a year, it was a very strong president indeed who could impose his personality on the permanent MCC secretariat of Griffith and Allen, and Gilligan was not a strong president.\\"Oborne, p. 194. Initially D'Oliveira was left out of the team, but when a player withdrew with an injury, the selectors added him as a replacement; the South African government barred D'Oliveira from taking part and the MCC cancelled the tour.Oborne, pp. 222‚Äì26. In 1971, a stand named after Gilligan was opened at Hove Cricket Ground, but this was demolished in 2010 as part of a redevelopment. Gilligan died in Pulborough, Sussex, on 5 September 1976, aged 81.

Upon the conclusion of Poland's failed revolution against Russia, he cried, \\"All this has caused me much pain. Who could have foreseen it?\\". Unlike √©tudes of prior periods, works designed to emphasize and develop particular aspects of musical technique, the romantic √©tudes of composers such as Chopin and Liszt are fully developed musical concert pieces, while still continuing the goal of developing stronger technique. Technique In the case of Op. 10, No. 12, the technique required in the opening bars is playing long, loud descending runs, which forms a dominant seventh chord introductory build-up to the main theme. The length and the repetition of these rapid passages distinguishes the \\"Revolutionary\\" from other √©tudes. The rest of the passage focuses on the left hand fingering scales and arpeggios. Although the greatest challenge lies with the relentless left hand semiquavers, the right hand is also challenged by the cross-rhythms which are used with increasing sophistication to handle the same theme in various successive parallel passages. The left hand technique in this piece involves evenly played semiquavers throughout. The structure is of the strophic form (A‚ÄìA‚Ä≤‚Äìcoda). Some may also argue that it is of the ternary form (A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA‚Äìcoda). The opening broken chords (diminished chord with an added passing note) and downward passages transition into the main appassionato melody. The octave melody's dotted rhythms and the continuous accompaniment give an impression of tension.. The piece ends by recalling the opening in a final descending sweep (with both hands) descending to a C major chord, although within a context that draws its expected function as a resolution into question. Influences The end of the √©tude alludes to Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 32, written in the same key‚Äîa piece Chopin is known to have greatly admired ‚Äì compare bars 77‚Äì81 in the √âtude to bars 150‚Äì152 in the first movement (also ending in C major) of Beethoven's sonata.

It is at the south end of the five-county Rochester Metropolitan Area. The population of the town was 10,483 at the 2010 census. The English name \\"Geneseo\\" is an anglicization of the Iroquois name for the earlier Iroquois town there, Gen-nis-he-yo (which means \\"beautiful valley\\"). The village of Geneseo lies within the western portion of the town. The village and town are known today mainly as the home of the State University of New York at Geneseo.  History = Pre-revolution  Near Geneseo was the largest Seneca village, Chenussio, a center of power for the Iroquois Confederacy. It was also the confederacy's \\"bread basket\\", with orchards, vineyards, and fields of maize and vegetables. During the American Revolution, the Seneca joined the British and the Tories against the colonists who were fighting for independence. The alliance's raids from the west were a major threat to the American cause, and General Washington sent the Sullivan Expedition to neutralize the Iroquois. As Sullivan's army approached Geneseo with their \\"scorched earth\\" policy, the Senecas repeatedly fell back. However, a large Seneca party ambushed one of Sullivan's scouting parties, carried them as prisoners to Geneseo and tortured them to death. When Sullivan's troops arrived and found the savagely mutilated bodies, they became enraged and destroyed anything that could support the Iroquois. No longer able to raid from Geneseo and the surrounding area, about 5,000 Seneca fled to British-held Fort Niagara, where they spent one of the coldest winters on record, with much loss of life, in camps outside the fort with only the small amount of supplies the British could spare.  Post-revolution  The town was established in 1789, before the formation of Livingston County. The settlement of Geneseo by the colonists began shortly after the arrival of James and William Wadsworth in 1790. The brothers came to the Genesee Valley from Connecticut as agents of their uncle, Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth, to care for and sell the land he had purchased. The Wadsworths were participants in the negotiations of the Treaty of Big Tree between Robert Morris and the Senecas at the site of Geneseo in 1797. Geneseo, as well as nearby Mount Morris, was part of the Morris Reserve that Morris held back from his sale of much of western New York to the Holland Land Company. Geneseo was the birthplace of Eliza Emily Chappell Porter in 1807, who was a nurse, teacher, school builder, and Underground Railroad operative during the Civil War. Geneseo was also the birthplace, in 1851, of the swindler Ferdinand Ward. The village of Geneseo became the county seat of Livingston County in 1821 and was incorporated in 1832. The State Normal School, now SUNY Geneseo, opened in 1871. A portion of the village was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior in 1991.  Present day  The Doty building, which was purchased and renovated for usage by SUNY Geneseo, was once Geneseo's high school. Currently it holds administrative offices for the college. The Livingston County Courthouse and offices are at the end of Main Street. A P-51 Mustang at the 2007 Geneseo Airshow Conesus Lake during the 2006 \\"Ring of Fire\\" The valley of the Genesee River is wide and fertile, with some of the best agricultural land in New York, but it was very prone to flooding, and Geneseo suffered several bad floods until the United States Army Corps of Engineers' construction of the Mount Morris Dam upstream of the community in the 1950s. Agriculture is now a large contributor to Geneseo's economy. Geneseo is also used by many as a bedroom community for jobs in Rochester, to the north. The village of Geneseo is governed by a mayor and four trustees. The town can be roughly divided into three geographies: the village has a small-town atmosphere, much of Route 20A is commercialized, and the majority of the town's area is farmland. One of the main issues faced by the community today is urban sprawl. The increasing presence of big-box stores on Route 20A has been welcomed by some residents, who appreciate the convenience of nearby retailers, and discouraged by others, who oppose the suburbanization of the small town. The Geneseo Airport (D52) is a general aviation airport west of the village, on the Wadsworth farm. It was established during July 1969, and is used for approximately 20 aircraft operations each day. Since 1980, it has hosted groups restoring and operating historic military aircraft‚Äîoriginally the National Warplane Museum, and now the 1941 Historical Aircraft Group Museum. An airshow is held annually on the field, during the second weekend in July. The Association for the Preservation of Geneseo (APOG) is a civic organization dedicated to preserving, improving, and restoring the places of civic, architectural, and historic interest to Geneseo and to educate members of the community to their architectural and historical heritage. Additional aims and purposes are to encourage others to contribute their knowledge, advice, and financial assistance. Sweet Briar and the Wadsworth Fort Site are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Education The Geneseo Central School District encompasses Geneseo and Groveland, and consists of Geneseo Central School, which graduates approximately 75 students each year. The school mascot is the Blue Devils and wear blue and white, with a gray accent color. Past accent colors included red and black. In 1933, the school moved to its own building on School Street and in 1963 added a wing. In 1974 it moved into a new building at its present location on Avon Road.Jen-o-see 1933, '63 & 1974‚Äì75, yearbooks of the school Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which are land and , or 2.65%, are water. The Genesee River defines the western town line, and Conesus Lake is on part of the eastern town line.

A leg-spin and googly bowler and attacking batsman, he captained England in one Test match, in South Africa in 1927. He was widely regarded as one of the leading amateur cricketers of his generation who, because of his commitments outside cricket, was unable to fulfil his potential and left the game early. Stevens was an outstanding schoolboy cricketer, whose exploits at University College School brought him to the attention of Middlesex, for whom he made his debut in 1919 while still at school. He won cricket blues at the Oxford in each of the years 1920 to 1923, and was captain of the university side in 1922. He played for Middlesex between 1919 and 1932, and appeared altogether in 10 Test matches. The first of these was against South Africa in 1922‚Äì23, the last against the West Indies in 1929‚Äì30. He was a member of the side that regained the Ashes from Australia in 1926. Had he been able to devote himself more fully to cricket, Stevens's overall first-class record would, in the view of commentators, have been more impressive. After he left Oxford in 1923, his cricket appearances became increasingly intermittent, and in 1932, at the age of 31, he gave up the first-class game altogether, although he played in occasional minor matches until 1947. He served as an officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the Second World War. Cricket career=School, Middlesex debut and Oxford University College School in the early 20th century Stevens was born and grew up in Hampstead, North London, where he attended University College School. There, he began to show considerable talent as a cricketer, as a bowler of leg-breaks and googlies, and this was recognised in 1918 when Wisden, widely regarded as the \\"bible of cricket\\", named him as one of \\"Five School Bowlers of the Year\\". In the following season, 1919, he created a batting sensation by scoring 466 runs for Beta House v. Lambda House, in an internal school match. This feat attracted the attention of Middlesex County Cricket Club, who drafted him into their side to play Hampshire at Lord's on 9‚Äì10 June 1919. On his county debut Stevens took 10 Hampshire wickets in the match, including 7 for 104 in their first innings. Stevens held his place in the Middlesex XI for the remainder of the season, and was chosen to play for the Gentleman in the prestigious Gentlemen v. Players fixture at Lord's ‚Äì an almost unprecedented honour for a schoolboy cricketer. In the match he scored 24 and 11, and took 1 wicket for 62 runs. In the autumn of 1919 Stevens entered Brasenose College, Oxford. In his first match for the University, against Warwickshire, he took 5 for 35 in the county's first innings. He was a regular member of the side for each of his four years' residence, the batting highlights of which were two centuries scored in 1923: 115 against the MCC, and 182 (his best first-class score) against the West Indies touring side. He gained his cricket \\"blue\\" in 1920, his freshman year, and in each of the following three years, and was captain in 1922. His performances in the University matches against Cambridge were modest until his final year, 1923, when his bowling ‚Äì he took 6 for 20 in the Cambridge first innings ‚Äì played a significant part in Oxford's overwhelming victory that year. In all, Stevens played 40 matches for Oxford University, scoring 2,484 runs with two centuries, for a batting average of 38.81. He took 146 wickets for a bowling average of 19.91, and held 54 catches. Middlesex and EnglandCounty= While at Oxford, Stevens played for Middlesex when the university term was over, and helped the county to win the County Championship title in 1920 and 1921. In 1922 he recorded the best bowling figures of his career, 8 for 38, for Middlesex against Hampshire, at Portsmouth. After leaving Oxford, the need to earn a living affected his availability to play regular cricket for Middlesex; his appearances became less frequent, and in 1928 and 1929 he did not appear for the county at all. He managed almost a full season in 1931, when he made his highest score for the county ‚Äì 170 not out against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, and appeared regularly in the first part of the 1932 season, but at the end of June withdrew from the side and played no more county cricket. That was end of his first-class career, except for a couple of festival games in 1933. For Middlesex, Stevens played 127 matches between 1919 and 1932. He scored a total of 5,434 runs for the county, including 7 centuries, for a batting average of 30.18. He took 385 wickets, with a bowling average of 27.41, and held 107 catches. =England= While still at Oxford, Stevens was invited to go to South Africa with the 1922‚Äì23 MCC touring side under Frank Mann. The team played a series of five Test matches against the South African side; Stevens played in the first of these, at the Wanderers ground, Johannesburg, beginning on 23 December 1922. He made little impression on the game, and did not feature in the rest of the Test series. Stevens's next Test opportunity came in 1926, in the fourth Test against Australia. During the match England's captain, Arthur Carr, was taken ill and had to withdraw. A stand-in captain was required; at the time, practice and tradition suggested the choice of an amateur. Thus, as the only other amateur in the team, Stevens might have been asked to fulfil this role. However, he was the youngest and least experienced in a side that included several veteran professionals. The selectors broke with the amateur captain tradition and chose Jack Hobbs, who accepted but only after first offering to defer to Stevens. The match was drawn, as had been the previous three; Stevens kept his place for the decider at The Oval, which England won and thus regained the Ashes. These two matches against Australia were Stevens's only Test appearances in England. He made two further MCC tours: to South Africa again in 1927‚Äì28, under R.T. Stanyforth, and to the West Indies in 1929‚Äì30, under Freddie Calthorpe. In South Africa, Stevens played in all five Tests, unproductively except for a score of 69 in the third Test at Durban. For the fifth Test of the series Stanyforth was unfit, and Stevens assumed the England captaincy for this one match, which was lost. In the West Indies he played in two Tests, in the first of which he took ten wickets: 5 for 105 and 5 for 90 ‚Äì his best bowling performance in Test cricket. Stevens played in 10 Tests altogether, scoring 263 runs, average 15.47, and taking 20 wickets, average 32.40. He also held 9 catches. Other matches Alongside his county and Test appearances, Stevens played regularly for the Gentlemen, for whom he scored two centuries in Gentlemen v. Players matches. He often turned out in the end-of-season Scarborough Festival matches, for various sides. In early 1932 he went with Lord Tennyson's XI to Jamaica, and played in three representative matches, all of which were won by Jamaica. In the first of these, Jamaica scored 702 for 5 declared (George Headley 344 not out); Stevens's bowling figures were 2 for 194. In the second match, however, Stevens recorded one of his best bowling analyses, taking 8 for 87 in the Jamaicans' first innings. In the third game Stevens achieved figures of 3‚Äì199 in Jamaica's first innings, but came close to winning the match for Tennyson's XI with 4 for 63 in the second innings. First-class record In all first-class cricket, Stevens played in 243 matches. He scored 10,376 runs, average 29.56, with 12 centuries, highest score 182. He took 684 wickets, average 26.84, best analysis 8 for 38, and held 213 catches. Later life After his first-class cricket career was over, Stevens played in occasional minor matches, including several for The Forty Club in 1938‚Äì39. After the Second World War in which he served as a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer, he toured The Netherlands with the Free Foresters side, in August and September 1947 when he was 46 years old. He died at his home in Islington on 19 September 1970. Stevens was widely regarded as one of the finest amateur cricketers of his time. However, like other prominent amateurs of his era such as Gubby Allen and Douglas Jardine, he had to arrange his cricket around the demands of his working life. In his case this eventually proved too difficult, hence his early departure from the game. Commentators accept that, had he been able to spare more time for cricket, he would have improved his career record considerably. Alan Gibson, in his history of the England Test captaincy, comments on his modest Test figures: \\"[T]his is not sufficient evidence to say he would have been a poor Test player, had he been able to give himself more opportunities\\". Whether he would have proved a successful England captain, Gibson adds, is equally hard to say.

Her husband was Edward the Confessor, whom she married on 23 January 1045. Unlike most English queens in the 10th and 11th centuries, she was crowned.Pauline Stafford, 'Edith, Edward's Wife and Queen', in Richard Mortimer ed., Edward the Confessor: The Man and the Legend, The Boydell Press, 2009, pp. 119, 129‚Äì130. Stafford states (p. 124) that Edith was between 12 and 25 when she married, and probably nearer 25. The principal source on her life is a work she herself commissioned, the Vita √Üdwardi Regis or the Life of King Edward who rests at Westminster, which is inevitably biased.Historians disagree whether this was partly written in 1065‚Äì66, before Edward's death, or was a unitary work of the late 1060s. Stafford, 2009, pp. 119‚Äì120 and note, Ann Williams, ODNB, Edith Early life Edith was the daughter of Godwin, the most powerful earl in England. Her mother Gytha was sister of Ulf, a Danish earl who was Cnut the Great's brother-in-law. Edith was originally named Gytha, but renamed Ealdgyth (or Edith) when she married King Edward the Confessor.Harold Godwinson Her brothers were Sweyn (c. 1020 ‚Äì 1052), Harold (later Harold II) (c. 1022 ‚Äì 1066), Tostig (c. 1026 ‚Äì 1066), Gyrth (c. 1030 ‚Äì 1066), Leofwine (c. 1035 ‚Äì 1066), and Wulfnoth (c. 1040 ‚Äì 1094). Edith was the firstborn of Godwin's three daughters, which included her sisters Gunhild (or Gunhilda) (c. 1035 ‚Äì 1080) and √Ülfgifu (c. 1035 ‚Äì ?). The exact birthdates of the Godwin children are unknown, but Sweyn was the firstborn and Harold was the second son.Mason House of Godwine p. 10 Harold was aged about 25 in 1045, which makes his birth date around 1020.Rex Harold p. 31 Edith was brought up at Wilton Abbey. She was an educated woman who spoke several languages, skills she probably acquired at Wilton. She remained attached to it, and in later years rebuilt its church.Stafford, 2009, pp. 121‚Äì126 Her niece, Gunhild of Wessex, would also be educated at Wilton. The Vita Edwardi emphasised her piety. She helped Giso, the Bishop of Wells, secure the endowments of his see, and gave lands to Abingdon Abbey, but the monks of Evesham alleged that she had the relics of many monasteries brought to Gloucester so that she could select the best for herself. When Gervin, abbot of Saint-Riquier, who was visiting the English court, rejected her kiss of greeting, she took offence. Edward reproved her, and she accepted the rebuff, even going on to urge English churchmen not to kiss women, although they did not object to the custom. Edith lost four of her brothers in a very short span. Tostig died on 25 September 1066 during the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Three others ‚Äì Harold, Gyrth, and Leofwine ‚Äì all died on 14 October 1066, during the Battle of Hastings.Gytha Thorkelsd√≥ttir Marriage and life as queen Stafford states (p. 124) that Edith was between 12 and 25 when she married, and probably nearer 25. The marriage produced no children. Later ecclesiastical writers claimed that this was either because Edward took a vow of celibacy, or because he refused to consummate the marriage because of his antipathy to Edith's family, the Godwins. However, this is dismissed by modern historians. In the view of Edward's biographer, Frank Barlow, \\"the theory that Edward's childlessness was due to deliberate abstention from sexual relations lacks authority, plausibility and diagnostic value.\\"Frank Barlow, Edward the Confessor, Yale University Press: London, 1997, p. 82. In 1051 Godwin and his sons fell out with Edward and fled the country. Edith was sent to a nunnery, possibly because she was childless and Edward hoped to divorce her.Stafford, 2009, pp. 133‚Äì138 When the Godwins effected their return through force in 1052, Edith was reinstated as queen. In later years, she became one of Edward's inner group of advisers.Barlow, p. 167. In the Vita Edwardi, according to Barlow, \\"although she is always placed modestly behind the throne, the author does not minimize her power or completely conceal her will. Whenever we catch sight of her elsewhere, we see a determined woman, interfering, hard, probably bad-tempered.\\"Barlow, pp. 189‚Äì190. As the king's wife, she was responsible for his regal presentation. She commissioned works for his personal ornament, and had at least one goldsmith among her tenants. When he died, the Domesday Book shows that she was the richest woman in England, and the fourth wealthiest individual, after the king, Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury, and her brother Harold. She held land valued at between ¬£1,570 and ¬£2,000 per annum.Stafford, 2009, pp. 126‚Äì128 She was close to her brother Tostig, and in 1055 she and Harold secured his appointment as Earl of Northumbria. His rule was unpopular, and in 1064 Edith was accused at court of engineering the murder of the Northumbrian noble Gospatrick in Tostig's interest. In 1065 Tostig was probably hunting with King Edward when the northerners rebelled and elected Morcar, Harold's brother-in-law, as earl. Tostig charged Harold with conspiring with the rebels, a charge which Harold purged himself of with a public oath. Edward demanded that the rebels be suppressed, but to his and Edith's fury Harold and the English thegns refused to enforce the order. Morcar was confirmed as earl and Tostig forced into exile.William M. Aird, Tostig, Oxford Online Dictionary of National Biography, 2004Stafford, 2009, p. 135 Later life and death Upon Edward's death, on 4 January 1066, he was succeeded by Edith's brother, Harold Godwinson. At the Battle of Stamford Bridge (25 September 1066) and the Battle of Hastings (14 October 1066), Edith lost four of her remaining brothers (Tostig, Harold, Gyrth and Leofwine). Her brother Wulfnoth, who had been given to Edward the Confessor as a hostage in 1051 and soon afterwards became a prisoner of William the Conqueror, remained in captivity in Normandy. Edith was therefore the only senior member of the Godwin family to survive the Norman conquest on English soil, the sons of Harold having fled to Ireland. Carola Hicks, an art historian, has recently put her forward as a candidate for the author of the Bayeux Tapestry.BBC Radio 4, Woman's Hour, 22 May 2006Carola Hicks, The Bayeux Tapestry: The Life of a Masterpiece ) After Edward's death Edith read the lives of English saints, and gave information about St Kenelm to his hagiographer, Goscelin.Stafford, 2009, p. 125 She died at Winchester on 18 December 1075.Ann Williams, DNB, \\"Edith (d. 1075)\\" Matthew Paris records a tradition that her death brought an end to an illness from which she had been suffering at some length. She was buried together with her husband in Westminster Abbey and her funeral was arranged by William.Stafford, Queen Emma and Queen Edith, pp. 278‚Äì9.

Mountsorrel is a village in Leicestershire on the River Soar, just south of Loughborough with a population in 2001 of 6,662 inhabitants,Local Communities in Charnwood http://www.charnwood.gov.uk/uploads/localcommunitiesincharnwood.pdf increasing to 8,223 at the 2011 census. Geography Part of Mountsorrel Castle The village is in the borough of Charnwood, surrounding a steep hill, once crowned by a castle, and is bordered to the east by the River Soar. The village is renowned for the Buttercross Market in the village centre as well as its granite quarry, the largest in Europe. The Leicester arm of the Grand Union Canal runs through Mountsorrel. The civil parish meets with Rothley to the south, and some houses are actually in Rothley parish near the southern A6 junction. To the west of the parish is a nature reserve. North of here the Leicestershire Round passes east‚Äìwest through the north of the village. The parish boundary meets Quorndon where it first meets the quarry near Buddon Wood. North of there it crosses the former A6 500 metres towards Quorn from the roundabout for the A6 roundabout. Close to the bypass the River Soar becomes the parish boundary and south of the A6 northern junction it meets Sileby at the point where it crosses the A6 bypass. 500 metres south of there the boundary leaves the river to the west, with the river becoming the Sileby- Rothley boundary. Geology The local area is built on granite. Leicester's Humberstone came from this granite (igneous rock), and was originally known as Hunbeort's Stan. Another piece of Mountsorrel granite is at an RAF memorial at Screveton in Nottinghamshire near the A46. History=Early history St Peter's parish church A castle was built in 1080 by Hugh Lupus, but there is evidence of an earlier Norman settlement in the area in the form of pottery fragments. A Roman villa is supposed to have existed on Broad Hill during the 4th century AD, the site of today's quarry, as quarrying during the late 1800s revealed many artefacts including a preserved wooden bucket.mountsorrel.org.uk However, the first recording of the village was in 1377, when it had a population of 156. In 1151, Robert le Bossu, the Earl of Leicester and deputy to Henry II of England, who was the Justicar, or Chief Justice of the Peace for the area, acquired the tenancy of Mountsorrel castle. According to the historian Jim Bradbury, the acquisition of the castle by the Earl of Leicester was as a result of a 'final concord of peace' with Ranulf, Earl of Chester.Bradbury, Jim (2009) Stephen and Matilda: the Civil War of 1139‚Äì53, The History Press, p. 210 Whilst the origin of the name 'Mountsorrel' is still not understood fully, it is thought that the English nobility of the time named Mountsorrel after Montsoreau castle, a castle in France close to Fontevrault, where Henry II was buried. The name Mountsorrel is of Norman- French origin and is thought to have developed due to the close likeness of Montsoreau and Mountsorrel ‚Äì both settlements sit on rivers, the Loire and the Soar respectively, and are overshadowed by surrounding hills.Harper, Charles George (1924) The Manchester & Glasgow road: this way to Gretna Green, C. Palmer, p. 180 Mountsorrel castle was used as a bastion against King Stephen, and was subsequently destroyed in 1217 by the King's men from Nottingham, branded \\"a nest of the Devil and den of thieves and robbers\\". The future King Louis VIII of France had sent support in the form of 20,000 men to the besieged barons in the castle, but this force had failed to arrive in time to prevent the razing to the ground of the castle. All that remains of the castle today is a granite crag on Castle Hill. The hill is also the site of a memorial (by Shirley Harrison, 1926) to those who lost their lives in World War I.Pevsner, Nikolaus (1960) The Buildings of England: Leicestershire and Rutland, Penguin Books, p. 195, 247 One of the parish churches is Christ Church and the other, a Grade II* listing building, is dedicated to St Peter. Recent history War memorial on Castle Hill The village was visited by Methodist preacher John Wesley, where he preached in a building which now belongs to Stonehurst Family Farm, a tourist attraction. By an act of Parliament passed on 22 July 1782 Henry Walkery of Thurmaston and John Sultzer of Burton Overy were empowered to enclose the open fields and common grounds of Mountsorrel, some . The Leicester Navigation was opened in 1794 and the first barges between Loughborough and Leicester departed on 26 October. Mountsorrel was the site for a hospital for the mentally ill, which had 91 beds in 1979,Index of Lunatic Asylums and Mental Hospitals but this has since closed and been converted to a housing estate. By 1781, the population was recorded as '150 dwellings', and by 1840 the population of Mountsorrel had reached 1,900. During World War II, in 1942, Alvis, an armoured vehicle manufacturer based in Coventry, acquired a factory previously used to produce cardboard boxes in the village after their factory in Coventry was bombed by the Luftwaffe. Alvis built a new factory on the site of an old brickworks, which DeHavilland, an aeroplane propeller manufacturer, briefly used after the war until Rolls-Royce Limited acquired the site in 1945. The site has since closed and is now covered by housing (see below). The A6 dual-carriageway Quorn-Mountsorrel Bypass opened in October 1991, allowing quarry traffic to avoid travelling through the village centre. On 31 July 2004 a new leisure centre opened in the village, the Soar Valley Leisure Centre. Christ Church & St Peters primary school is on Rothley Road. The Stonehurst Family Farm and Motor Museum established in 1951 is located in the centre of the village and is home to many animals and offers tractor trailer rides. The Butter Market The Butter Market was built in 1793 by the Lord of the Manor, Sir John Danvers, to replace the fifteenth century Market Cross, which he had removed to use on his estate in Swithland, where it still remains. It is a Grade II* listed structure. The Old Rectory The Adam Style building opposite St Peter's Church and actually on the Leicester to Loughborough road, was built in 1783 for Ralph Tebbutt, whose monument is in St Peter's Church. Formerly known as Mountsorrel Hall it was a vicarage until 1983. A copy of this building was erected in 1790 in Liverpool, and in that house the politician and former Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898) was born. Industry and trade=Market In 1292, Nicholas de Seagrave became Lord of the Manor and was granted by Edward I the right to hold a market in Mountsorrel each Monday. Seagrave's father, Stephen de Seagrave, was Chief Justice of England at the time, a position of great power, which may explain the granting of such a market. In addition to the granting of the market, de Seagrave was permitted to hold an annual fair for the \\"eve and morrow of St John the Baptist and 5 days after\\". This fair was abolished in 1873 after villagers petitioned, as the legislation licensing the fair allowed anyone displaying a bush over their door to distribute liquor free of any duties. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Mountsorrel market had become increasingly important, with trade in raw wool, leather and woollen yarn, horses and cattle as well as 'Mountsorrel gloves', once as highly regarded as gloves from Woodstock and Oxford, being common. Quarry Buddon Quarry As early as 1860, there was a branch line, the Mountsorrel Railway, to the quarry, the path of which is still followed by a mineral conveyor to Barrow- upon-Soar, where quarry rock is sorted for distribution. Organised quarrying of the granite in Mountsorrel Quarry began in the late eighteenth century, and had around 500 employees by 1870. In 1872, the Mountsorrel Granite Company acquired the rights to quarry the area from the Broad Hill quarry, and a hospital had become established in the village to deal with those made ill by the dust created by the quarrying. Mountsorrel quarry Mountsorrel is home to one of the largest granite quarries in Europe, with an area of 785,400 m2.LaFarge Aggregates, Mountsorrel Quarry The granite, technically hornblende granite, is primarily used in construction and road-repair. The quarry produces approximately 3 million tonnes per annum with reserves of 160 million tonnes of granite, making it one of the top ten largest producing quarries in EuropeThe Quorndon Magazine http://www.quorndon- mag.org.uk/archive/autumn1997/redland.html in 1997. The quarry is blasted at 12.30 pm most weekdays,A Guide to Mountsorrel Quarry http://www.lafarge- aggregates.co.uk/LAF5883-LO-RES.pdf with a force that is felt throughout most of the village, as well as in some parts of Loughborough, Quorn, Swithland, and Rothley. The quarry was run by Redland Quarries until its acquisition by Lafarge in the 1990s. The quarry itself is home to the common lizard, an endangered species.Quarry Products Association Rolls-Royce Rolls-Royce acquired a factory previously used by an aircraft propeller manufacturer after World War Two in 1945. The factory, officially known as 'Rolls-Royce Mountsorrel',mountsorrel.org.uk became a specialist production factory for 'structural and high temperature fabrications', advising on new designs of both aircraft and cars for Rolls-Royce. In a fire during a heatwave on 13 May 1959, the manufacturing area of the factory was heavily damaged although the design department was left undamaged. In 1969, the Mountsorrel Rolls-Royce factory designed and produced components for the RB211 engine for the Lockheed Tristar, and during the 1970s the factory employed 1,200 people. The site closed in 1994 as production methods changed and has since been replaced by a housing estate. Sports teams * Mountsorrel Castle Cricket Club is a cricket club founded c.1880.

Definition A given opinion may deal with subjective matters in which there is no conclusive finding, or it may deal with facts which are sought to be disputed by the logical fallacy that one is entitled to their opinions. Distinguishing fact from opinion is that facts are verifiable, i.e. can be agreed to by the consensus of experts. An example is: \\"United States of America was involved in the Vietnam War,\\" versus \\"United States of America was right to get involved in the Vietnam War\\". An opinion may be supported by facts and principles, in which case it becomes an argument. Different people may draw opposing conclusions (opinions) even if they agree on the same set of facts. Opinions rarely change without new arguments being presented. It can be reasoned that one opinion is better supported by the facts than another, by analyzing the supporting arguments. In casual use, the term opinion may be the result of a person's perspective, understanding, particular feelings, beliefs, and desires. Though not hard fact, collective opinions or professional opinions are defined as meeting a higher standard to substantiate the opinion. Epistemology Historically, the distinction of demonstrated knowledge and opinion was articulated by Ancient Greek philosophers. Today, Plato's analogy of the divided line is a well-known illustration of the distinction between knowledge and opinion, or knowledge and belief, in customary terminology of contemporary philosophy. Opinions can be persuasive, but only the assertions they are based on can be said to be true or false. Collective and professional opinions=Public opinion In contemporary usage, public opinion is the aggregate of individual attitudes or beliefs held by a population (e.g., a city, state, or country), while consumer opinion is the similar aggregate collected as part of marketing research (e.g., opinions of users of a particular product or service). Typically, because the process of gathering opinions from all individuals are difficult, expensive, or impossible to obtain, public opinion (or consumer opinion) is estimated using survey sampling (e.g., with a representative sample of a population). Group opinion In some social sciences, especially political science and psychology, group opinion refers to the aggregation of opinions collected from a group of subjects, such as members of a jury, legislature, committee, or other collective decision-making body. In these situations, researchers are often interested in questions related to social choice, conformity, and group polarization. Scientific opinion \\"Scientific opinion\\" may reflect opinions on scientific concerns as articulated by one or more scientists, published in scholarly journals or respected textbooks, both of which entail peer-review and rigorous professional editing. It may also refer to opinions published by professional, academic, or governmental organizations about scientific findings and their possible implications. A related‚Äîbut not identical‚Äîterm, scientific consensus, is the prevailing view on a scientific topic within the scientific community, such as the scientific opinion on climate change. Scientific opinion(s) can be \\"partial, temporally contingent, conflicting, and uncertain\\" so that there may be no accepted consensus for a particular situation. In other circumstances, a particular scientific opinion may be at odds with consensus. Scientific literacy, also called public understanding of science, is an educational goal concerned with providing the public with the necessary tools to benefit from scientific opinion. Legal opinion A \\"legal opinion\\" or \\"closing opinion\\" is a type of professional opinion, usually contained in a formal legal-opinion letter, given by an attorney to a client or a third party. Most legal opinions are given in connection with business transactions. The opinion expresses the attorney's professional judgment regarding the legal aspect of the transaction. The opinion can be \\"clean\\" or \\"reasoned\\". A legal opinion is not a guarantee that a court will reach any particular result. However, a mistaken or incomplete legal opinion may be grounds for a professional malpractice claim against the attorney, pursuant to which the attorney may be required to pay the claimant damages incurred as a result of relying on the faulty opinion. Judicial opinion A \\"judicial opinion\\" or \\"opinion of the court\\" is an opinion of a judge or group of judges that accompanies and explains an order or ruling in a controversy before the court. A judicial option generally lays out the facts that the court recognized as being established, the legal principles the court is bound by, and the application of the relevant principles to the recognized facts. The goal is to demonstrate the rationale the court used in reaching its decision. Judges in the United States are usually required to provide a well- reasoned basis for their decisions and the contents of their judicial opinions may contain the grounds for appealing and reversing of their decision by a higher court. Judicial opinions are discussed further in the articles on common law and precedent. Editorial opinion An \\"editorial opinion\\" is the evaluation of a topic by a newspaper as conveyed on its editorial page.

It has a division called MSC Cruises that focuses on holiday cruises. History MSC Tomoko in the Santa Barbara Channel, 2009 MSC was founded in Naples in 1970 as a private company by seafaring captain Gianluigi Aponte when he bought his first ship, Patricia, followed by Rafaela, with which Aponte began a shipping line operating between the Mediterranean and Somalia. The line subsequently expanded through the purchase of second-hand cargo ships. By 1977, the company operated services to northern Europe, Africa and the Indian Ocean. The expansion continued through the 1980s; by the end of the decade, MSC operated ships to North America and Australia. In 1989, MSC purchased the cruise ship operator Lauro Lines, renamed to Mediterranean Shipping Cruises (MSC Cruises) in 1995, and subsequently increased the cruising business. In 1994, the line ordered its first newly constructed ships, which were delivered beginning in 1996 with MSC Alexa. They were built by Italian shipbuilder, Fincantieri. As of October 2014, Diego Aponte (son of MSC founder Gianluigi Aponte) was named president and chief executive of MSC, taking over from his father who was named group executive chairman. Gianluigi Aponte would continue to oversee all group related activities as well as supporting Diego in shaping the future of MSC. The company today New MSC containers. As one of the world's leading container shipping lines with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, MSC operates 480 offices across 155 countries worldwide with over 28,000 employees. MSC's shipping line sails on more than 200 trade routes, calling at over 315 ports. MSC operates vessels with a capacity of up to , including (as of 2019) the world's two largest container ships, MSC G√ºls√ºn and MSC Samar. The company remains independent and wholly owned by the Aponte family under the leadership of Diego Aponte who was appointed President and CEO by his father and company founder Gian Luigi in October 2014. In May 2014, MSC cruises closed a deal to order two new vessels from the Italian shipbuilding company Fincantieri in a 2.1 billion euro order. In August 2014, MSC ordered a new cruiseship worth up to ‚Ç¨3bn ($4.13bn) from STX France. The Saint-Nazaire yard will build two firm ships for ‚Ç¨1.5bn. The first ship is due in the first half of 2017, with the second in the first half of 2019. The contracts will provide 16m working hours for the French shipbuilder. The order has been on the cards since February, with a vessel size of around 160,000 gt cited. Passenger capacity will be about 4,000 people. In December 2014, the MSC shipping line ranked number 6 in Lloyd's List Top 100 Most Influential People in Shipping. In January 2015, MSC launched the largest container ship, MSC Oscar, with a capacity of 19,224 TEU. Built by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering and registered in Panama, it joins the Albatross service in January as part of the 2M VSA (Vessel Sharing Agreement between Maersk Line and MSC). Later in 2015 MSC launched three more container ships of same capacity and named MSC Oliver, MSC Zoe and MSC Maya. In February 2017, MSC purchased a 49% stake into Messina Line, an Italian shipping Line founded in Genoa, Italy in 1929, specialised in intra Mediterranean short sea, and Europe to East and West Africa routes. The company owns 8 Roll-on/roll-off vessels and a Terminal in Genoa port, on top of a container fleet of 65,000 teu. In January 2018, MSC announced the launch of a regular dedicated Roll-on/roll-off service in between Northern Europe and West Africa, by deploying two car carrier vessels: MSC Immacolata and MSC Cristiana, previously chartered out to other Lines. In October 2018, MSC decided to charter out its 2 car carriers to Grimaldi Group, replacing them on the service towards West Africa with two Messina Line - ConRO vessels: MSC Cobalto (formerly Jolly Cobalto) and MSC Titanio (formerly Jolly Titanio). The swap of these ships, that were previously deployed on MSC Adriatic Trade in between the ports of Trieste and Izmir, results in view of a tighter collaboration in between MSC and Messina Line.

Brig. Gen. William B. Franklin's Union division landed at Eltham's Landing and was attacked by two brigades of Brig. Gen. G. W. Smith's command, reacting to the threat to the Confederate army's trains on the Barhamsville Road. Franklin's movement occurred while the Confederate army was withdrawing from the Williamsburg line, but he was unable to interfere with the Confederate movement. Background When Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston unexpectedly withdrew his forces from the Warwick Line at the Battle of Yorktown the night of May 3, Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was taken by surprise and was unprepared to mount an immediate pursuit. On May 4, he ordered cavalry commander Brig. Gen. George Stoneman to pursue Johnston's rearguard and sent approximately half of his Army of the Potomac along behind Stoneman, under the command of Brig. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner. These troops fought in the inconclusive Battle of Williamsburg on May 5, after which the Confederates continued to move northwest in the direction of Richmond.Salmon, pp. 80-83. Peninsula Campaign, map of events up to the Battle of Seven Pines. McClellan also ordered Brig. Gen. William B. Franklin's division to board transport ships on the York River in an attempt to land and cut off Johnston's retreat. It took two days just to board the men and equipment onto the ships, so Franklin was of no assistance to the Williamsburg action. But McClellan had high hopes for his turning movement, planning to send other divisions (those of Brig. Gens. Fitz John Porter, John Sedgwick, and Israel B. Richardson) by river after Franklin's. Their destination was Eltham's Landing on the south bank of the Pamunkey River across from West Point, a port on the York River, which was the terminus of the Richmond and York River Railroad. From the landing, it was about south to the small town of Barhamsville, where a key intersection on the road to New Kent Court House was being used by Johnston's army on the afternoon of May 6.Eicher, p. 270; Sears, p. 85; Salmon, p. 83. Franklin's men came ashore in light pontoon boats and a long floating wharf was then built from pontoons, canal boats, and lumber, so that artillery and supplies could be unloaded. The work was continued by torchlight through the night and the only enemy resistance was a few random shots fired by Confederate pickets on the bluff above the landing, ending at about 10 p.m.Sears, p. 85; Salmon, p. 85. Battle Map of Eltham's Landing Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Johnston ordered Maj. Gen. G. W. Smith to protect the road to Barhamsville and Smith assigned the division of Brig. Gen. William H. C. Whiting and Hampton's Legion, under Colonel Wade Hampton, to the task. On May 7, Franklin posted Brig. Gen. John Newton's brigade in the woods on either side of the landing road, supported in the rear by portions of two more brigades (Brig. Gens. Henry W. Slocum and Philip Kearny).Webb, p. 82. Newton's skirmish line was pushed back as Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood's Texas Brigade advanced, with Hampton to his right. Hood was concerned about casualties from friendly fire in the thick woods, so he ordered his men to advance with unloaded rifles. Encountering a Union picket line 15 paces away, Hood wrote, \\"A corporal of the enemy drew down his musket upon me as I stood in front of my line.\\" Fortunately for Hood, Private John Deal of the 4th Texas Infantry had disobeyed his orders and carried a loaded rifle; he managed to shoot the Union corporal before the latter could fire.Salmon, p. 85; Sears, p. 86. As a second brigade followed Hood on his left, the Union troops retreated from the woods to the plain before the landing, seeking cover from the fire of Federal gunboats. Whiting employed artillery fire against the gunboats, but his guns had insufficient range, so he disengaged around 2 p.m. Union troops moved back into the woods after the Confederates left, but made no further attempt to advance. Aftermath The Battle at Eltham's Landing was little more than a heavy skirmish. There were 194 Union casualties and 48 Confederate. Franklin told McClellan, \\"I congratulate myself that we have maintained our position.\\"Sears, p. 86. Although the action was tactically inconclusive, Franklin missed an opportunity to intercept the Confederate retreat from Williamsburg, allowing it to pass unmolested.Salmon, p. 85; Webb, p. 82, argues that Franklin's instructions \\"were to wait at Eltham until further orders. No mention was made about cutting off the enemy. To make the attempt alone would have been hazardous, and the remaining divisions could not concentrate for several days.\\" Johnston was pleased with the outcome. Considering the success his men enjoyed in executing the order \\"to feel the enemy gently and fall back,\\" he humorously asked General Hood, \\"What would your Texans have done, sir, if I had ordered them to charge and drive back the enemy?\\" Hood replied, \\"I suppose, General, they would have driven them into the river, and tried to swim out and capture the gunboats.\\" NotesReferences * Eicher, David J.

A left-handed batsman, he played 26 Test matches for England, captaining the side in 17 of those games. Chapman was appointed captain for the final, decisive Test of the 1926 series against Australia; under his captaincy, England defeated Australia to win the Ashes for the first time since 1912. An amateur cricketer, Chapman played Minor Counties cricket for Berkshire and first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Kent. Never a reliable batsman, Chapman nevertheless had a respectable batting record. He could score runs very quickly and was popular with spectators. As a fielder, contemporaries rated him extremely highly. Although opinions were divided on his tactical ability as a captain, most critics accepted he was an inspirational leader. Born in Reading, Berkshire and educated at Uppingham School, Chapman established a reputation as a talented school cricketer and was named one of Wisden's schoolboy Cricketers of the Year in 1919. He went to Pembroke College, Cambridge and represented the University cricket team with great success; his fame reached a peak when he scored centuries against Oxford University and in the Gentlemen v Players match within the space of a week. Chapman made his Test debut in 1924, although he had yet to play County Cricket. Having qualified for Kent, he was the surprise choice to take over from Arthur Carr as England captain in 1926. He achieved victory in his first nine matches in charge but lost two and drew six of his remaining games. Perceived tactical deficiencies and possibly growing concerns over his heavy drinking meant that Chapman was dropped from the team for the fifth Test against Australia in 1930. He captained England on one final tour in 1930‚Äì31, after which he never played another Test. After he assumed the Kent captaincy in 1931, his career and physique declined until he resigned the position in 1936; he retired altogether in 1939, by which time he was drinking heavily. Chapman's fame as a cricketer made him a popular public figure; he and his wife, whom he married in 1925, were well known figures in fashionable society and their appearances were followed closely in the press. Outside of cricket, he worked for a brewery. In his later years, Chapman increasingly suffered from the effects of alcoholism and was often seen drunk in public. He and his wife divorced in 1942; he spent his final years, mainly alone, suffering from depression, arthritis and a continued dependence on alcohol. Following a fall at his home and a subsequent operation, Chapman died in 1961, aged 61. Early life Chapman was born on 3 September 1900 in Reading, Berkshire, the son of Frank Chapman, a schoolteacher, and his wife Bertha Finch. Chapman's father encouraged him to play cricket and coached him personally.Lemmon, p. 23. Chapman was first educated at his father's preparatory school, Fritham House, and by the age of eight was in the school's first eleven.Lemmon, p. 24. In September 1910, he joined Oakham School and scored his first century, dominating the cricket and football teams.Lemmon, p. 25. From 1914 to 1918, he attended Uppingham School. Although his academic performance was undistinguished,Lemmon, p. 28. he soon established a cricketing reputation. By 1916, he was in the Uppingham first team; he achieved second place in the school's batting averages, bringing him to the attention of the wider public.Lemmon, p. 26. Chapman improved his record in 1917, scoring 668 runs at an average of 111.33; he hit two fifties, two centuries and a double century in his last five innings. In 1918, Chapman scored 472 runs at 52.44 and took 15 wickets; the following year, he captained the team, scored 637 runs at an average of 70.77 and took 40 wickets.Lemmon, pp. 26‚Äì29. As a consequence of his achievements, he was chosen as one of the Cricketers of the Year for 1919 in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. In both 1918 and 1919 he was selected for prestigious school representative matches at Lord's Cricket Ground;Swanton, p. 137. although his weak defensive play drew comment, he was regarded as one of the most promising cricketers of his generation when he left Uppingham in 1919. University cricket In 1919, Chapman entered Pembroke College, Cambridge.Lemmon, p. 30. He failed in two trial games, organised prior to the 1920 cricket season to inform the selection of the Cambridge team, and despite his reputation, was omitted from the University's opening first-class match against Essex.Lemmon, pp. 31‚Äì32. But on the day of the match, a player withdrew from the Cambridge team and Chapman replaced him. Making his first-class debut on 15 May 1920, he scored 118 in a rapid innings and kept his place in the team for the remainder of the season. After a century and two fifties, he was selected for the University Match against Oxford. Chapman scored 27 in this final game of the university season to aggregate 613 runs at an average of 40.86, second in the Cambridge batting averages.Lemmon, p. 32. Unusually for someone in their first year of University cricket, he was subsequently selected for the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. Although not particularly successful with the bat, critics singled him out for his effective fielding. During August, he played second-class Minor Counties cricket for Berkshire as an amateur and headed the team's batting averages; he later appeared in three end-of-season first-class games at the Scarborough Festival where he scored 101 in a Gentlemen and Players game against a bowling attack containing three internationals.Lemmon, p. 33. In all first-class matches in 1920, Chapman scored 873 runs at 39.68. Chapman in about 1922 In 1921, Chapman averaged over 50 for the University and scored three centuries, although his growing reputation meant some critics felt he had underachieved.Lemmon, p. 34. He once again played in the University match against Oxford, and for the Gentlemen against the Players, and impressed commentators. Some critics suggested he, along with other promising University players, should play for England; the Test side were in the middle of a series against Australia which was lost 3‚Äì0, in the course of which an unusually large number of players were selected.Lemmon, pp. 36‚Äì37. Chapman once more appeared for Berkshire in August, scoring 468 runs and taking 19 wickets.Lemmon, p. 37. At the end of the season, he was selected by Archie MacLaren in a match at Eastbourne, playing for an all-amateur non- representative England team against the undefeated Australian touring team. In a match which became famous in later years, MacLaren's team became the first to defeat the tourists, although Chapman was not successful personally.Lemmon, pp. 37‚Äì38. Chapman finished the season with 954 runs at 39.75. That winter, The Cricketer magazine named Chapman as a young cricketer of the year.Lemmon, pp. 38‚Äì39. However, at the beginning of the 1922 season, his form was so poor that critics suggested leaving him out of the University Match. He had scored 300 runs from 14 innings, but retained his place partially on the strength of his fielding.Lemmon, p. 41. After Cambridge batted very slowly on the first day, Chapman attacked the bowling on the second morning to score 102 not out. Cambridge won easily, concluding Chapman's cricket at the university, but his innings impressed critics to the extent that he was again selected for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. There, he scored 160 and shared century partnerships with Arthur Carr and Frank Mann. Chapman earned praise for his aggression and his stroke-play on the off side.Lemmon, p. 42. The Times described it as \\"one of the great innings in the history of the game\\". Shortly after this, Sydney Pardon wrote in The Times: \\"In the cricket field the most interesting figure at the moment is, beyond all comparison, Mr. A. P. F. Chapman. A fortnight ago we were all lamenting his ill-success this season and wondering whether he would ever do justice to his great gifts and fulfil the hopes entertained of him in 1920. Most effectually he has put his critics to shame ... he is in such a position that if an England eleven had to meet Australia next week he would be picked at once with acclamation.\\" Prior to this, only R. E. Foster had scored centuries in both the University Match and the Gentlemen v Players match in the same year. Chapman ended his season by scoring 805 runs and taking 19 wickets for Berkshire, and playing in festival games.Lemmon, p. 43. He aggregated 607 runs at 33.72 in first-class matches for the season. Chapman was popular at Cambridge and enjoyed his time there. He took part in a variety of social engagements and became involved in other sports.Lemmon, pp. 39‚Äì40. These included fives, tennis, rugby union, golf and football.Lemmon, p. 31. He captained Pembroke College at rugby and was close to playing for the full university side. Chapman continued to play rugby for Berkshire Wanderers until he was nearly 30 years old.Lemmon, p. 40. Also for Pembroke, he played as goalkeeper in the football team and might have played for the university at hockey had he taken the sport seriously. In later years, he also displayed proficiency at tennis, in which critics thought he could have reached a high standard if motivated to do so, and golf. Cricket career in the mid-1920s=MCC tour to Australia and New Zealand The MCC team that toured Australian in 1922‚Äì23: Chapman is sitting on the front row on the extreme left. During the English winter of 1922‚Äì23, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) selected a team to tour Australia and New Zealand. This side, captained by Archie MacLaren and composed mainly of amateurs, was not particularly strong and contained several players chosen for their social standing rather than cricketing ability.Lemmon, pp. 44‚Äì45. The team played four first-class games in Australia against state teams; the first was drawn and the others were lost. After scores of 75 and 58 against Western Australia, Chapman played consecutive innings of 53, 73 and 69 against South Australia and Victoria, followed by 100 in the most eagerly awaited match of the tour against a strong New South Wales side.Lemmon, p. 46. The press and public praised his attacking batting and his fielding, although Frank Iredale, a former Test cricketer, noticed some flaws in his technique.Lemmon, pp. 45‚Äì47. When the team moved on to New Zealand, after an uncertain start Chapman scored 533 runs at an average of 48.45, including two centuries.Lemmon, p. 47. The tourists returned to Australia for the last leg of the tour; Chapman scored 91 against New South Wales and 134 in 142 minutes against South Australia.Lemmon, p. 48. In all the Australian games, he totalled 782 runs at 65.16; in all the matches on tour he had 1,315 runs at an average of 57.15. Qualifying for Kent When Chapman returned to England, he began to work for a brewery based in Kent, H & G Symonds; his residence in that county allowed him to qualify for Kent County Cricket Club. There were few opportunities for Chapman to appear in first-class cricket until he qualified. His cricket was mainly restricted to club level in 1923, with some further games for Berkshire. In addition, he played 12 first-class games for a variety of teams; he was selected for the Gentlemen v Players matches at Lord's and The Oval, scoring 83 in the latter game, and played in two trial matches for players on the verge of England selection, although no Tests were played that year.Lemmon, p. 51. In total, he scored 615 first-class runs at 29.28. The focus of attention during the 1924 season was selection of a team to contest the Ashes during a Test-playing tour of Australia the following winter. Critics regarded Chapman as a certainty for the team.Lemmon, p. 52. Continuing to play as an amateur, he made his first appearance for Kent in a non-Championship match, as he was still qualifying, and was very successful in early season club matches. That summer, England played South Africa in a Test series and Chapman was selected for a trial game before the first Test. He scored 64 not out and 43 for \\"The Rest\\", and following the withdrawal of a batsman owing to injury before the first Test, Chapman made his Test debut against South Africa on 14 June. He became one of the few cricketers to represent England while playing for a minor county rather than a team playing in the County Championship. Chapman batted once and scored eight runs; he drew praise from Wisden for an \\"amazing\\" catch on the last day as South Africa were heavily beaten.Lemmon, p. 53. He retained his place for the second Test but did not bat: only four English batsmen were needed in the game which the home side won by an innings. Although selected for the third game, Chapman did not play owing to a motorbike accident. He was not seriously hurt but missed the remainder of the Test series and the Gentlemen v Players game at Lord's. Upon recovering, he returned to play for Berkshire without much success and played several festival games at the end of the season.Lemmon, p. 54. By this stage, he had already been selected to tour Australia. In the final match of the season, he was selected for \\"The Rest\\" to play the County Champions, Yorkshire. He scored 74 in 50 minutes and hit three sixes, two of them from consecutive deliveries from Wilfred Rhodes. This was his highest score of the season, in which he made 561 first-class runs at 31.16. Second tour to Australia The MCC team to Australia was led by Arthur Gilligan. In the opening matches, Chapman was cheered by the crowds who remembered his achievements on the last tour, but failed to make any significant scores.Lemmon, pp. 55‚Äì56. His first big innings came against Victoria; he made 72 runs out of 111 scored while he was batting and played a large part in a win for the MCC.Lemmon, p. 56. Against Queensland in the following match, he scored 80 in 70 minutes and then hit 93 against a representative Australian XI.Lemmon, p. 57. He was selected for the first four Tests of the five-match series. Batting aggressively, he made several substantial scores but only once passed fifty‚Äî in the third Test, he scored 58, his first Test half century.Lemmon, pp. 57‚Äì58. During the same Test, Gilligan strained a muscle while bowling and had to leave the field; Chapman took over as captain. England lost the first three matches, giving Australia an insurmountable lead in the series, but won the fourth. Chapman was left out of the side for the final Test.Lemmon, p. 58. In the series, he scored 185 runs at an average of 30.83, and critics were divided as to his ability and effectiveness. The former Australian captain Monty Noble believed Chapman could be a good batsman if he curbed his aggression but The Cricketer considered his technique to be faulty. Wisden did not judge Chapman a complete failure and noted that he \\"made useful scores at times\\". In all first-class games, Chapman scored 625 runs at 34.72. Although Chapman had a mixed time on the cricket field, the tour was a success for him socially.Lemmon, p. 59. Now qualified to play county cricket for Kent, Chapman played only four times in the County Championship in 1925, preferring to establish himself in his new career in the brewery trade. Not sufficiently wealthy to play cricket full- time as an amateur, Chapman's business commitments frequently restricted his appearances on the cricket field.Lemmon, pp. 59‚Äì60. During his limited first- class appearances in 1925, he scored 207 runs at 25.87 and Wisden said that he \\"did nothing out of the common\\".Lemmon, p. 60. England captain=Ashes series of 1926 Carr (right) and Chapman leading the England team to the third Test against Australia at Headlingley in 1926. By the beginning of the 1926 season, Chapman was no longer the star of English cricket. Although still respected for his earlier achievements, he had a modest record in Test and first-class cricket.Lemmon, p. 61. During the season, the Australians toured England for another Ashes series. Chapman did not play any early season games and his first match for Kent was against the touring side. He scored 51, his first first-class fifty since January 1925.Lemmon, p. 62. A week later, he scored 159 in the County Championship, bringing him back into contention for an England place, then scored 89 in a Test trial match played against the Australians.Lemmon, p. 63. Chapman's appearances for Kent were sporadic for the rest of the season, but he scored 629 runs in his nine County Championship games at an average of 57.18 to lead the Kent averages. He also scored a century for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's. Early in the season, Arthur Carr was named as England captain for the start of the series; Carr was a popular choice and the only other serious contender at the time was Percy Fender.Lemmon, p. 11. Chapman played in two of the three trial matches and was chosen for the first Test but did not bat in a match ruined by rain. The second Test was drawn but Chapman scored fifty.Lemmon, p. 12. Australia dominated most of the third Test but England saved the game; Chapman scored 15 and 42 not out in the match. However, Carr's tactical approach during the match was heavily criticised and he dropped a crucial catch on the first morning.Lemmon, pp. 12‚Äì13.Gibson, pp. 127‚Äì28. Chapman was omitted from the side for the fourth Test, but fielded as substitute when Carr became ill during the game.Lemmon, pp. 13‚Äì14. As the first four matches of the series were drawn, the final Test, played at The Oval, was decisive. Aware that England had beaten Australia only once in 19 matches, the selectors made several changes to the team; Chapman, at the time fourth in the national batting averages, replaced Carr as captain.Lemmon, pp. 14‚Äì15. This decision was controversial; the press favoured Carr, particularly as Chapman was young, unproven as captain and not fully established in the team.Gibson, p. 129.Lemmon, p. 16. When the match began on 14 August, Chapman won the toss and decided that England should bat first. When it was his turn to bat, he was given a good reception by the crowd.Lemmon, pp. 17‚Äì18. During his innings, Wisden noted, Chapman \\"hit out in vigorous fashion\\", but once he was dismissed for 49, the remaining batsmen were out quickly, leaving England with a disappointing total of 280. Australia replied with 302. On a pitch affected by rain, England then scored 436, mainly because of a large partnership between opening batsmen Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe. Australia needed to score 415 to win, which was unlikely given the condition of the pitch. The team were bowled out for 125, and at least one of Chapman's tactical decisions resulted in Australia losing a wicket. Wisden reported that \\"not a catch was missed nor was a run given away, the whole England side rising gallantly to the occasion. Naturally a scene of tremendous enthusiasm occurred at the end, the crowd swarming in thousands in front of the pavilion, and loudly cheering the players, both English and Australian.\\" The correspondent also commented \\"Chapman ... despite lack of experience in leading a first-class team in the field, turned out a very happy nomination for the post of captain, the young amateur, for the most part, managing his bowling with excellent judgement, and in two or three things he did, showing distinct imagination.\\" Throughout the match, Chapman chose to follow his own tactics rather than rely on the veteran players in the team for advice. In the series, he scored 175 runs at 58.33. Aftermath and success Following the match, Chapman was lauded as a cricketing hero,Lemmon, p. 20. and among those who sent congratulatory messages were George V and Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin.Lemmon, p. 65. In all first-class matches in the season, he scored 1,381 runs at an average of 51.14, the first time he had passed four figures in a season. In his history of the England cricket captaincy, Alan Gibson notes that the controversy over Chapman's appointment was soon forgotten following his success. He writes: \\"English cricket had a new hero who looked the part ... Every selector was a champion!\\" In its summary of the 1927 season, Wisden named him as Kent's best batsman and noted an improvement in his defensive technique. Against Lancashire, who retained the County Championship, he scored 260 in three hours' batting, the highest score of his career.Lemmon, pp. 65‚Äì66. The Lancashire bowling attack included former Australian Test bowler Ted McDonald, regarded as the fastest bowler in the world at the time and feared by most county batsmen.Gibson, p. 147. Many critics praised Chapman's innings as one of the best ever played. He was selected to lead the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's for the first time,Lemmon, p. 67. and led representative sides in two of the three Test trials held that season; the press judged his captaincy to be good.Lemmon, pp. 67‚Äì69. He totalled 1,387 runs in first-class games at an average of 66.04, the highest aggregate and average of his career. The Kent captaincy became available at the end of the season, but Chapman was not appointed; according to Chapman's biographer, David Lemmon, he was probably approached but was unable to dedicate the necessary time to the position.Lemmon, p. 69. Chapman was unavailable for the Test series in South Africa in the winter of 1927‚Äì28, but was a certainty to lead the MCC team to Australia in 1928‚Äì29. The selectors wished him to play more regularly, so he played more often in 1928 than any other season. He began in good form, but was never as effective as in 1927. Although his captaincy continued to be highly regarded, there were concerns in the press over his increasing weight, although these were offset by his impressive fielding in that season's Tests. He captained England to a 3‚Äì0 series win over West Indies, who were playing their first Test matches,Lemmon, pp. 70‚Äì72. and scored one fifty. In total, he scored 967 first-class runs at 37.19. As expected, Chapman was named as captain for the Australian tour. The MCC touring team was regarded as a strong one by commentators; the only controversy was the omission of Frank Woolley which was not fully explained. Rumours in later years said that Chapman was responsible for leaving Woolley out as he was jealous of his county teammate, but Lemmon regards this as unlikely.Lemmon, p. 75. Tour of Australia 1928‚Äì29 alt=A group of cricketers coming onto the field According to Douglas Jardine's biographer, Christopher Douglas, \\"[Chapman] hardly put a foot wrong during the tour and, even though he gave Australia their biggest hiding to date, he was and probably remains ... one of the most popular English captains to tour Australia.\\"Douglas, p. 65. From the opening games, England followed a strategy of accumulating large totals.Lemmon, pp. 77‚Äì78. For the first Test, to strengthen the team's batting, Chapman and the tour selection committee chose only three specialist bowlers; as the Tests were \\"timeless\\"‚Äîplayed to a finish with no time limit‚Äîhe believed batting to be the key to victory.Lemmon, p. 79. England batted first and scored 521; Chapman scored 50, but critics believed he should have batted more cautiously.Lemmon, p. 80. When Australia began their innings, he held a catch from Bill Woodfull in the gully which several observers rated as among the best they had seen.Douglas, p. 72.Lemmon, p. 81. Sydney Southerton, writing of the English fielding, said: \\"The high note was struck by Chapman himself at Brisbane when, with a catch that will be historic, he dismissed Woodfull ... It is my opinion that catch had a pronounced effect on the course of events in the three subsequent Tests ... [Chapman's fielding] exercised a most restraining influence on the Australian batsmen.\\" Australia were bowled out for 122; Chapman did not ask Australia to follow-on but batted again, to the crowd's displeasure,Lemmon, p. 84. and his batsmen relentlessly built up the England lead. When Chapman became the first captain to declare an innings closed in a timeless Test match, Australia needed 742 to win. On a rain-affected pitch, Australia were bowled out for 66; England's win by 675 runs remains in 2016 the largest margin of victory by runs in Tests.Lemmon, p. 82. Chapman's team won the second Test comfortably after scoring 636 in their first innings, the highest team total in Tests at that time.Lemmon, p. 85. In the third Test, England began the fourth innings requiring 332 to win on a rain-damaged pitch, a task critics believed impossible.Lemmon, p. 87. A large opening partnership from Hobbs and Sutcliffe gave England a chance, and Hobbs sent a message to the England dressing room suggesting a tactical change in the batting order. But the team could not find Chapman, who according to Percy Fender, in attendance as a journalist, spent most of his time socialising with guests in the Ladies' Stand. Consequently, the team followed Hobbs' plan without the approval of the captain.Douglas, pp. 74‚Äì75. England's batsmen took the total to within 14 of victory when the fourth wicket fell. Chapman came in and batted in an unusual way; after attempting some big shots, he played ultra- defensively, possibly in an attempt to allow Patsy Hendren to reach fifty runs before England won. Hendren was out soon after, then Chapman tried to hit a six and was caught. The batsmen continued to play recklessly and a further wicket fell to a run out. Douglas describes the end of the match: \\"Meanwhile, [England batsman George Geary] was quite unruffled by the sudden upsets. He wound up for the next delivery and thumped it through mid-on for 4, bellowing, 'Dammit, we've done 'em!' It was an appropriate way for a side under Chapman to win the Ashes.\\"Douglas, p. 77. England's victory in the third Test ensured the Ashes were retained, and the team also won the fourth Test to take a 4‚Äì0 lead in the series.Lemmon, pp. 90‚Äì91. Up to this time, Chapman had enjoyed a harmonious relationship with the Australian crowds. However, in the match against Victoria which followed the fourth Test, the crowd barracked the MCC team when Chapman brought on Harold Larwood, a fast bowler, to bowl against Bert Ironmonger, the number eleven, a tactic regarded as unsporting.Douglas, p. 83. As the team returned to the pavilion, Chapman was insulted by members of the crowd in the midst of a minor scuffle. Possibly influenced by these events, he withdrew from the final Test; illness and his poor form may also have been factors. According to Lemmon, it was suggested in later years that Chapman did not play owing to his heavy drinking.Lemmon, p. 135. In his absence, Australia won the fifth Test. After the fifth day of play and having played both his innings, Jardine left to catch a boat to India, for reasons which are unclear, and Chapman acted as his substitute in the field. Douglas notes that it looked like England \\"were trying to pull a fast one by picking their strongest batting side (which meant dropping Chapman) without weakening the fielding (since Chapman was Jardine's substitute).\\"Douglas, p. 84. The Australians agreed to the substitution on the condition that Chapman did not field near the batsmen. In the Tests, Chapman scored 165 runs at 23.57, and in all first-class matches he reached 533 runs and averaged 33.31. Southerton summarised his performance: \\"Chapman himself began well in batting but in the later matches was too prone to lash out at the off ball and, as the tour progressed, the Australian bowlers discovered his weakness.\\" On his captaincy, Southerton wrote: \\"Chapman captained the side uncommonly well, improving out of all knowledge as the tour progressed.\\" Socially, Chapman enjoyed the tour; he attended many functions and events; Bill Ferguson, the team scorer, only saw him annoyed once on the tour: when his accustomed drink was not waiting for him at a lunch interval.Lemmon, p. 89. Ashes series of 1930 Hobbs and Chapman at the first Test against Australia at Trent Bridge, Birmingham, 13 June 1930. Following the end of the 1928‚Äì29 tour, Chapman did not return to England until July, midway through the cricket season; Jack White and Arthur Carr captained England in his absence. Chapman resumed playing for Kent shortly after his return home but appeared in only seven matches, with a top- score of 28. His season was curtailed when he fell awkwardly while fielding in a match against Sussex at the beginning of August.Lemmon, pp. 93‚Äì97.Gibson, p. 132. He also missed the two MCC tours that winter to New Zealand and West Indies, neither of which involved a full-strength team.Gibson, pp. 135‚Äì36. In 1930, Australia toured England once more. Before the Test series, Chapman was not a unanimous choice among press correspondents; several critics believed he should not be in the team on account of his rapidly increasing weight‚Äîformer England captain Pelham Warner suggested he needed to lose at least two stone‚Äîand concern over his poor batting form.Lemmon, pp. 99‚Äì100. However, Chapman began the season well, impressing commentators with his batting, fielding and captaincy, and was named as England captain for the first Test match.Lemmon, pp. 100‚Äì101. In the first innings, he scored 52 in 65 minutes, and England won the match by 93 runs on the fourth day. The Wisden correspondent wrote: \\"Chapman, with his resources limited, managed his bowling well and himself fielded in dazzling fashion.\\" This was Chapman's sixth successive victory over Australia and he had won all nine of the Tests in which he was captain. However, it was to be his last Test victory.Gibson, p. 143. England lost the second Test by seven wickets, and Gibson describes the match as the \\"turning point in Chapman's fortunes\\". Wisden observed: \\"Briefly, the Englishmen lost a match, which, with a little discretion on the last day, they could probably have saved.\\" England scored 425 in their first innings, but Donald Bradman hit 254 runs and Australia reached 729 for six declared. When Chapman came in to bat in the second innings, England still trailed by 163 runs and had lost four wickets‚Äîa fifth fell soon after.Lemmon, pp. 103‚Äì07. He attacked the bowling immediately, and shared a large partnership with Gubby Allen. When the latter was out, Chapman began to score even faster. He took England into the lead, hitting out at almost every delivery to reach his only Test century after 140 minutes' batting. Wisden commented: \\"It was about this time that, with a little care and thoughtfulness, England might have saved the game ... So far from devoting their energies to defence they continued hitting away, adding another 113 runs in an hour and a quarter afterwards but losing their last five wickets.\\" Chapman was finally dismissed for 121, after batting for 155 minutes and striking 12 fours and 4 sixes. England were all out for 375, leaving Australia needing to score 72 runs to win. Although Chapman held a difficult catch from Bradman which was praised by commentators, Australia won comfortably. Chapman's century made him the first batsman to score centuries at Lord's in the University match, in the Gentlemen v Players game and for England in a Test match; only Martin Donnelly later performed a similar feat, though his Test century was scored for New Zealand. As the Gentlemen v Players match ceased in 1962, the feat will never be repeated. Heavy rain on the third day of the third England-Australia Test at Headingley delayed the match. The team captains Chapman (left) and Woodfull are inspecting the field on 14 July 1930. In the immediate aftermath of the game, Chapman was praised for his batting; the team and selectors, rather than Chapman, were blamed for the defeat. However, his captaincy and tactics were later criticised, by Pelham Warner among others. In particular, his placement of fielders and his refusal to play defensively were questioned. Gibson notes that historians regard this match as a turning point in Test matches; afterwards, captains became more concerned to avoid defeat rather than follow Chapman's policy of playing entertaining, attacking cricket whatever the result.Gibson, p. 144. Chapman's unwillingness to play for a draw was in later years held up as \\"the last sporting gesture by an England captain\\".Marshall, p. 199. In the third Test, Bradman made the highest individual score in a Test match by scoring 334 out of Australia's 566. Assisted by rain that shortened the available playing time, England drew the match.Lemmon, pp. 107‚Äì08. Chapman scored 45 in his only innings. The fourth Test match was also badly affected by rain which brought about another draw. Chapman now faced further criticism of his captaincy. His field placings were again queried; Warner noted that Chapman's tactics were poor and that he was slow to react to the opposition.Lemmon, pp. 108‚Äì09. According to cricket writer Leo McKinstry, the selectors lost faith in Chapman on account of his inconsistent, risky batting and his increased tactical shortcomings. However, McKinstry also writes that the selectors and other influential members of the cricketing establishment were privately concerned by Chapman's heavy drinking which they felt was affecting his leadership. There were also rumours that he was drunk during some sessions of the fourth Test.McKinstry, p. 333. Following an extended meeting of the selectors, Chapman was left out of the side and replaced as captain by Bob Wyatt.Lemmon, p. 109. The press were united in attacking the decision, praising Chapman's batting and captaincy while denigrating Wyatt's lack of experience.Lemmon, pp. 110‚Äì11. Gibson observes: \\"In 1930, despite the occasional criticisms, Chapman's position did not seem in any danger. He was still the popular, boyish, debonair hero. He had been having his most successful series with the bat, and as a close fieldsman England still did not contain his equal. He could not seriously be blamed because the English bowlers could not get Bradman out (though this was perhaps more apparent in retrospect than at the time). Wyatt, though nothing was known against him ... was a figure markedly lacking in glamour.\\" In the final Test, Bradman scored another century and England lost the match and series, although Wyatt played a substantial innings, and Wisden conceded Chapman could have made little difference except as a fielder. The two men remained friends during and after the controversy.Gibson, p. 146. In comparing circumstances of Chapman's appointment with those of his replacement by Wyatt, Gibson writes: \\"In 1926, England won: in 1930, England lost. That is why the echoes took so long to die down and why the selectors remained villains.\\"Gibson, p. 145. He concludes that, even though Wyatt did relatively well, \\"It does seem, after all these years, an odd decision to have taken.\\" In the series, Chapman scored 259 runs at 43.16. In all first-class cricket, he passed four figures for the final time, reaching 1,027 runs at an average of 29.34. South Africa tour 1930‚Äì31 Already chosen as tour captain before the final 1930 Ashes Test,Lemmon, p. 116. Chapman led an MCC team to a 1‚Äì0 series defeat in South Africa the following winter. Several first-choice players were not selected and the team suffered from injuries and illness. Chapman was popular with the crowds but made a poor start to the tour with the bat until he scored more substantially in the lead-up to the Test series.Lemmon, p. 117. England lost the opening match of the series by 28 runs and the other four were drawn. Needing to win the final match to level the series, England were frustrated when the start of the match was delayed. Chapman won the toss and chose to bowl on a damp pitch which would have favoured his bowlers. However, the umpires discovered the bails were the wrong size and would not start the game until new ones could be made; in the 20 minutes which were lost, the pitch dried out and England lost much of the advantage of bowling first.Lemmon, p. 118. Chapman made an official protest before leading his team onto the field.Lemmon, p. 119. In the series, he scored 75 runs at 10.71, and 471 runs at 27.70 in all first-class games. Wisden observed that \\"without finding his full powers as a punishing hitter, Chapman occasionally batted well\\". Socially, the tour was more successful. Chapman was accompanied by his wife, and his parents joined the tour for a time. He took part in many social events and visited several whiskey firms which were associated with his employers in England. Chapman played no further Test cricket; in 26 Tests, he scored 925 runs at an average of 28.90 and held 32 catches. He captained England in 17 matches, winning nine and losing two with the others drawn. Under him the team achieved seven consecutive victories, equalling the English record, which was not surpassed until 2004. His nine victories came in his first nine games as captain. Later career alt=Headshot of a man in a blazer Kent captain Although Chapman lost the England captaincy after the South African tour, he became official captain of Kent in 1931, having previously captained the side occasionally.Lemmon, pp. 120‚Äì21. Wisden commented that Chapman \\"exercised an invigorating influence\\" on the side.Quoted in Lemmon, p. 120. Before Chapman assumed the Kent captaincy, the county team was sharply divided along social lines and the amateur leadership was aloof from and often dismissive of the professional players.Marshall, pp. 78‚Äì79. Members of the team felt that he improved the atmosphere within the side and made the game enjoyable. Critics and players thought that he was past his best by the time he became captain, and already affected by alcoholism, but Chapman was successful as leader.Marshall, pp. 79‚Äì81. His fielding remained influential. However, his batting form was poor: in 1931, he scored 662 runs at an average of 18.38. Sections of the press thought he should remain England captain, but he was replaced as Test captain by Jardine, who was not a popular choice; the selectors chose Jardine to exercise more discipline on the team than Chapman had done.Douglas, pp. 93‚Äì96. At the end of the season, Chapman toured Jamaica in a team captained by Lord Tennyson and scored 203 runs in first-class matches at 33.83.Lemmon, p. 121. Chapman began the 1932 season in good form and appeared fitter than he had for many seasons. There were further calls in the press for him to captain England. Jardine's captaincy in 1931 left critics unimpressed and C. Stewart Caine, the editor of Wisden, wrote that \\"the impression appears to be widely entertained that Chapman, were he in [batting] form, would again be given charge of the [England] team.\\" Christopher Douglas believes that the difference between Jardine and Chapman in captaincy style made it harder for the press to accept Jardine. He writes: \\"Chapman's was just the kind of daredevil approach that is remembered with affection and, even though it was barely a year since he had lost the leadership, his reign was being regarded through rose-coloured specs.\\"Douglas, p. 105. However, it is unlikely that the selectors ever considered returning to him.Lemmon, pp. 122‚Äì23. During the season, Chapman scored 951 runs, averaged 29.71, and led Kent to third place in the County Championship for the second year in succession. Decline In 1933, he scored 834 runs but his average fell to 21.94 and he never again averaged over 23 in any season in which he played regularly. Owing to his increasing weight and lack of physical fitness, he found batting much harder. As his physique declined, he was unable to produce the same batting feats he had managed previously. In the field, although still catching effectively, his inability to chase the ball meant he fielded closer to the batsmen; he also took fewer catches.Lemmon, pp. 124‚Äì26. In both 1934 and 1935, he averaged around 22 with the bat and scored under 800 runs. In 1935, he scored his final first-class century, against Somerset, having not reached the landmark since 1931. Teammates and observers noticed that in the final years of his career, Chapman frequently left the field during matches, and they suspected he was drinking in the pavilion.Lemmon, p. 136. Chapman played infrequently in 1936, and the captaincy was shared between him and two others. He was reluctant to bat, to the extent of dropping down the batting order to avoid doing so, and his friends believed that his nerve had gone.Lemmon, p. 126. At the end of the season, he announced that business commitments forced him to give up the captaincy.Lemmon, pp. 126‚Äì27. Over the following three seasons, Chapman played for Kent in three more matches: against the New Zealand touring side in 1937 and in two Championship games in 1938. He also captained a non-representative England XI in a festival game against the New Zealanders in 1937, batting at number ten in the order and scoring 61. His remaining first-class matches were low-profile games against Oxford and Cambridge Universities; he played 13 games in his final three seasons. In his last first-class game, in 1939, he captained MCC against Oxford, scoring 12 and 0.Lemmon, p. 127. In all first-class cricket, Chapman scored 16,309 runs in 394 matches at an average of 31.97, and held 356 catches. By the time his career ended, his weight had increased even further, and Lemmon believes that he had become an embarrassment to other cricketers. Subsequently, Chapman faded away without much comment.Lemmon, p. 133. Technique and critical judgements alt=A cricketer batting Writer Neville Cardus described Chapman as \\"the schoolboy's dream of the perfect captain of an England cricket eleven. He was tall, slim, always youthful, and pink and chubby of face. His left-handed batting mingled brilliance and grace ... His cricket was romantic in its vaunting energy but classic in shape.\\" While batting, Chapman always tried to attack the bowling; although this meant he made mistakes which resulted in his dismissal,Robertson-Glasgow, p. 36. it meant that he could change the course of a game in a short time.Swanton, p. 138. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow described him as: \\"Tall, strong, and lithe, he was a left-handed hitter with orthodox defence, much of which was rendered unnecessary by a vast reach, and an ability to drive good-length balls over the head of mid-off, bowler, and mid-on. His cover-driving, too, was immensely strong.\\" Gibson notes that Chapman's career batting figures were good, but that critics believed that, with his talent, he should have scored more runs.Gibson, pp. 146‚Äì47. Gibson writes: \\"When Chapman was going well, he looked quite as good as Woolley [his Kent and England team-mate] at the other end, and in the mid-1920s there was no other English left-hander, possibly no other England batsman at all except Hobbs, of whom that could be said.\\" His increased weight in the 1930s robbed him of confidence and slowed him down to the point where his batting declined. When batting, Chapman usually wore the Quidnuncs cap. Commentators claimed that Chapman was not a subtle captain and lacked tactical astuteness. Even so, his record is better than most others who led England during Chapman's career. Pelham Warner believed that Chapman started well, but that in the later stages of 1930, his tactical sense markedly deteriorated.Lemmon, p. 131. On the other hand, several of Chapman's contemporaries believed him to be one of the best captains. Arthur Gilligan, one of Chapman's predecessors, considered him to be a model for the role,Lemmon, p. 129. and Bert Oldfield, who played against Chapman as Australia's wicket-keeper, thought that Chapman possessed an \\"aptitude\\" for leadership. Chapman's teams were usually harmonious and his sympathetic handling of his players often brought out the best in them. Writing in 1943, Robertson-Glasgow said: \\"He knew his men as perhaps no other captain of modern times has known them.\\" Cricket writer E. W. Swanton believes that Chapman's cavalier reputation was misleading in assessing his effectiveness, and that \\"underlying the boyish facade was both a shrewd cricket brain and the good sense to ask advice from those of greater experience.\\" Robertson-Glasgow described Chapman as among the greatest fielders of all time,Robertson- Glasgow, p. 37. and The Times observed that \\"at his best he had been one of the finest fielders ever to play for England\\". In his earlier years, he fielded in the deep but when he played for Kent and England, he was positioned closer to the batsmen‚Äîusually at gully or silly point. The Cricketer commented that his \\"capacious hands made him a brilliant close-to-the-wicket fielder, and some of his catches were miraculous\\". In his youth, Chapman bowled quite regularly, but his negative experience bowling for Berkshire lessened his enthusiasm, and he did not take it seriously.Lemmon, p. 50. Personal life Chapman with his wife Gertrude in 1930 Marriage and fame During May 1921, Chapman met Gertrude (\\"Beet\\" or \\"Beety\\") Lowry,Bill Francis, Tom Lowry: Leader in a Thousand, Trio, Wellington, 2010, p. 57. the sister of Tom Lowry, a cricketer from New Zealand who played for Cambridge and Somerset and went on to captain his country.Lemmon, p. 39. The couple met again when Chapman toured New Zealand in 1922‚Äì23, and became engaged. At the end of the 1924‚Äì25 Australia tour, they married and returned to England together. The wedding was widely reported and until the end of the decade the couple were heavily involved in social events. They were popular guests at functions, and became notable figures in the fashionable society of the upper classes. In 1923, Chapman joined a Kent brewery, H & G Symonds. His wife believed that his choice of a career working in the alcohol trade made his life difficult and contributed to his heavy drinking. The social duties associated with his job also contributed to his increased weight and failing fitness in the later part of his cricket career. Further problems arose through his fame; as he wanted to keep people happy, he drank frequently and attended many social functions.Lemmon, pp. 136‚Äì38. Cricket writer Ivo Tennant believes that Chapman's \\"taste for conviviality was his undoing\\". He always appeared happy, but Gibson observes \\"that is the way some men disguise their unhappiness\\", and Lemmon suggests that Chapman was seeking acceptance and felt lonely at heart. According to Lemmon, by the end of the Second World War, Chapman was largely living in the past, and that \\"mentally he was still in the happy days of University cricket.\\"Lemmon, p. 139. Later struggle E. W. Swanton observes that \\"from the war onwards [Chapman's] life went into a sad eclipse.\\" In 1942, Chapman was divorced from his wife; according to Lemmon, \\"Beet had stood much, but there is a point for all relationships beyond which one must not go\\". She returned to live in New Zealand in 1946. After 1946, Chapman shared a house with the steward of West Hill Golf Club, Bernard Benson, and his health continued to deteriorate. He was frequently observed to be drunk in public, although his appearance and manners remained impeccable; the cricket establishment ignored him, regarding him as an embarrassment, particularly on the occasions he watched matches at Lord's.Lemmon, pp. 140‚Äì41. By the end of his life, he was unable to attend any cricket matches. In addition to his alcoholism, Chapman became increasingly isolated, suffering from loneliness and depression.Gibson, p. 148. By the 1950s, he had developed arthritis, probably as a result of his sporting activities.Lemmon, pp. 142‚Äì43. On one occasion in 1955, Chapman was invited to a dinner organised by Kent; he was later discovered in the car park on the bumper of a car in a distressed state and had to be assisted back inside.Lemmon, p. 144. In September 1961, Chapman fractured his knee when he fell at his home. He was taken to hospital for an operation but died on 16 September 1961. The newspapers reported that he had been ill for a long time; his former wife later commented that \\"he must have died a very sad man\\".Lemmon, pp. 144‚Äì45. Tributes focused on his successes as a cricketer and appealing personality.Lemmon, p. 145. Summing up Chapman's life, Gibson writes: \\"But just as a good end can redeem a sad life, so a good life can redeem a sad end, and he had known his hours, his years of glory.\\" Swanton concluded his obituary of Chapman in 1961: \\"The elderly and the middle-aged will recall him rather in his handsome sunlit youth, the epitome of all that was gay and fine in the game of cricket.\\" NotesReferencesBibliography   External links 1900 births 1961 deaths Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge Berkshire cricketers Cambridge University cricketers England Test cricket captains English cricketers English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 England Test cricketers Free Foresters cricketers Gentlemen cricketers Kent cricketers Kent cricket captains Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Minor Counties cricketers North v South cricketers People educated at Uppingham School Sportspeople from Reading, Berkshire Wisden Cricketers of the Year L.

It was produced by Walter Wanger. It is based on Maxwell Anderson's successful Broadway play Joan of Lorraine, which also starred Bergman, and was adapted for the screen by Anderson himself, in collaboration with Andrew Solt. It is the only film of an Anderson play for which the author himself wrote the film script (at least partially). It is also the last film Fleming directed before his death in 1949. Plot Unlike the play Joan of Lorraine, which is a drama that shows how the story of Joan affects a group of actors who are performing it, the film is a straightforward recounting of the life of the French heroine. It begins with an obviously painted shot of the inside of a basilica with a shaft of light, possibly descending from heaven, shining down from the ceiling, and a solemn off-screen voice pronouncing the canonization of the Maid of Orleans. Then, the opening page of what appears to be a church manuscript recounting Joan's life in Latin is shown on the screen, while some uncredited voiceover narration by actor Shepperd Strudwick sets up the tale. The actual story of Joan then begins, from the time she becomes convinced that she has been divinely called to save France to her being burnt at the stake at the hands of the English and the Burgundians.

Filming began 16 September 1947Nat Segaloff, Final Cuts: The Last Films of 50 Great Directors, Bear Manor Media 2013 p 98-99 and was done primarily at Hal Roach Studios, with location scenes shot in the Los Angeles area. The 1948 Sierra Pictures never produced another film after Joan of Arc. Casting Bergman had been lobbying to play Joan for many years, and this film was considered a dream project for her. It received mixed reviews and lower-than-expected box office, though it clearly was not a \\"financial disaster\\" as is often claimed. Donald Spoto, in a biography of Ingrid Bergman, even claims that \\"the critics' denunciations notwithstanding, the film earned back its investment with a sturdy profit\\". The movie is considered by some to mark the start of a low period in the actress's career that lasted until she made Anastasia in 1956. In April 1949, five months after the release of the film, and before it had gone out on general release, the revelation of Bergman's extramarital relationship with Italian director Roberto Rossellini brought her American screen career to a temporary halt. The nearly two-and-a-half-hour film was drastically edited for its general release, and was not restored to its original length for nearly 50 years. Bergman and co-star Jos√© Ferrer (making his first film appearance and playing the Dauphin) received Academy Award nominations for their performances. The film was director Victor Fleming's last project‚Äîhe died only two months after its release. In Michael Sragow's 2008 biography of the director, he claims that Fleming, who was, according to Sragrow, romantically involved with Ingrid Bergman at the time, was deeply unhappy with the finished product, and even wept upon seeing it for the first time. Sragrow speculates that the disappointment of the failed relationship and the failure of the film may have led to Fleming's fatal heart attack, but there is no real evidence to support this. While contemporary critics may have agreed with Fleming's assessment of Joan of Arc, more recent reviewers of the restored complete version on DVD have not. Release=Original release The movie was first released in November 1948 by RKO. When the film was shortened for its general release in 1950, 45 minutes being cut out; it was distributed, not by RKO, but by a company called Balboa Film Distributors, the same company which re-released Alfred Hitchcock's Under Capricorn, also starring Ingrid Bergman. Restoration The movie was first released in November 1948 by RKO. When the film was shortened for its general release in September 1950, it was distributed not by RKO, but by a company called Balboa Film Distributors, the same company which re-released Alfred Hitchcock's Under Capricorn, also starring Ingrid Bergman. The complete 145 minute version of Joan of Arc remained unseen in the U.S. for about 49 years. Although the complete Technicolor negatives remained in storage in Hollywood, the original soundtrack was thought to be lost. The movie was restored in 1998 after an uncut print in mint condition was found in Europe, containing the only known copy of the complete soundtrack. When it finally appeared on DVD, the restored complete version was hailed by online movie critics as being much superior to the edited version. It was released on DVD in 2004. The edited version received its first television showing on the evening of April 12, 1968 (an Easter weekend), and has been shown on Ted Turner's WTCG and on cable several times. The full-length version was shown on Turner Classic Movies on March 13, 2011. This marked the first time that the complete unedited version had ever been shown on American television. Differences in versions There are several differences between the full-length roadshow version of the film and the edited general release version. *One that is immediately noticeable is that there is actually a snippet from Joan's trial during the opening narration in the edited version, whereas in the full-length version, the events of Joan's life are shown in chronological order. The narration is more detailed in the edited version than in the complete version, with much of it used to cover the breaks in continuity caused by the severe editing. *The edited version omits crucial scenes that are important to a psychological understanding of the narrative, such as the mention of a dream that Joan's father has which foretells of Joan's campaign against the English. When Joan hears of the dream, she becomes convinced that she has been divinely ordered to drive the English out of France. *Most of the first ten minutes of the film, a section showing Joan praying in the Domr√©my shrine, followed by a family dinner and conversation which leads to the mention of the dream, are not in the edited version. *In the complete 145-minute version, the narration is heard only at the beginning of the film, and there are no sudden breaks in continuity. *Entire characters, such as Joan's father (played by Robert Barrat) and Father Pasquerel (played by Hurd Hatfield) are partially or totally omitted from the edited version. *Even the opening credits are somewhat different, and run about two minutes longer. In the edited version, the story begins after Victor Fleming's director's credit, and in the full- length version, after the director's credit, a title card states \\"The Players\\" appears onscreen, after which all the major lead and supporting actors, as well as the characters that they play, are listed in order of appearance and in groups (e.g., \\"At Domr√©my\\", \\"At Chinon\\", etc.), much like Fleming's other lengthy film epic Gone with the Wind. More than 30 of the actors are listed. The edited version might be considered more cinematic through its use of maps and voice-over narration to explain the political situation in France. (In the full-length version, Joan's family discusses the political situation during dinner.) The full-length version, although not presented as a play-within-a- play, as the stage version was, nevertheless resembles a stage-to-film adaptation, makes great use of Maxwell Anderson's original dialogue, and may seem, to some, stagy in its method of presentation, despite having a realistic depiction of the Siege of Orl√©ans. Reception=Critical reception One of the modern criticisms of the film is that Bergman, who was 33 at the time she made the movie, was nearly twice as old as the real Joan of Arc; the Swedish actress would later play her (at age 39) in a 1954 Italian film, Giovanna d'Arco al rogo (Joan at the Stake). However, reviewers in 1948 did not object to this; it was ‚Äî and still is ‚Äî common in for an older actress to play a teenager, as the 24-year-old Jennifer Jones had in 1943's The Song of Bernadette, for which she won a Best Actress Oscar. Several contemporary critics criticized the film for being slow-paced and dialogue-driven, as does contemporary critic Leonard Maltin, who has not yet reviewed the full-length version; he has said that there is \\"not enough spectacle to balance the talky sequences\\". Box office The film was one of the bigger hits of the year earning $4.1 million in the U.S. However, due to high cost it recorded a loss of $2,480,436.

McClellan launched an amphibious operation against Richmond by landing troops at Fort Monroe and then marching northwest up the Virginia Peninsula. After the fall of Yorktown and the withdrawal of General Joseph E. Johnston's army up the Peninsula, only the Confederate Navy ironclad prevented Union occupation of the lower James River and Norfolk. When the Confederate garrison at Norfolk was evacuated by Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger on May 10, Commodore Josiah Tattnall knew that he could not navigate Virginia through the shallow stretches of the James River toward Richmond, so she was scuttled on May 11 off Craney Island to prevent her capture. This opened the James River at Hampton Roads to Federal gunboats. Confederate gun at Battery Dantzler, Drewry's Bluff. The only obstacle protecting Richmond from a river approach was Fort Darling on Drewry's Bluff, overlooking a sharp bend down river from the city. The Confederate defenders, including marines, sailors, and soldiers, were supervised by navy Commander Ebenezer Farrand and by army Captain Augustus H. Drewry (the owner of the property that bore his name) of the Southside Heavy Artillery.Sears, p. 93; Eicher, p. 273, states that it was the 2nd Virginia Artillery. The eight cannons in the fort, including field artillery pieces and five naval guns, some salvaged from Virginia, commanded the river for miles in both directions. Guns from , including an smoothbore, were just upriver and sharpshooters gathered on the river banks. An underwater obstruction of sunken steamers, pilings, debris, and other vessels connected by chains was placed just below the bluff, making it difficult for vessels to maneuver in the narrow river.Salmon, p. 87.

On May 15, a detachment of the U.S. Navy's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, under the command of Commander John Rodgers steamed up the James River from Fort Monroe to test the Richmond defenses. The flotilla consisted of the ironclad gunboats USS Monitor (commanded by Lieutenant William N. Jeffers) and (the flagship), the screw gunship , the side-wheeler , and the twin-screw semi-submersible ironclad USRC Naugatuck.Eicher, pp. 272‚Äì73. At 07:45, Galena closed to within of the fort and anchored, but before Rodgers could open fire, two Confederate rounds pierced the lightly armored vessel. The battle lasted over three hours and during that time, Galena remained almost stationary and took 45 hits. Her crew reported casualties of 14 dead or mortally wounded and 10 injured. Monitor was a frequent target, but her heavier armor withstood the blows. Contrary to some reports, Monitor, despite her squat turret, did not have difficulty bringing her guns to bear and fired steadily against the fort.Richmond Battlefield Park signage Naugatuck sustained little damage compared to the Monitor and Galena due to her semi- submersible design. Unfortunately she had to withdraw when her 100-pounder Parrott rifle exploded. The two wooden gunboats remained largely out of range of the big guns, but the captain of Port Royal was wounded by a sharpshooter. Around 11:00, the Union ships withdrew to City Point.Sears, pp. 93‚Äì94; Salmon, p. 87; Eicher, p. 273. Aftermath Cpl John F. Mackie firing from the USS Galena During the battle, Corporal John F. Mackie became the first Marine to earn the Medal of Honor. The massive fort on Drewry's Bluff had blunted the Union advance just short of the Confederate capital, at a loss of seven Confederates killed and eight wounded.Sears, p. 94. Richmond remained safe. Rodgers reported to McClellan that it was feasible for the navy to land troops as close as from Richmond. Some amateur researchers think the Union Army never took advantage of this observation,Eicher, p. 273. yet the entire purpose of the expedition was to obtain such information. The area saw action again during the Siege of Petersburg. The Army of the James landed on May 5, 1864, at Bermuda Hundred, a neck of land north of City Point at the confluence of the James and Appomattox Rivers, only south of Richmond. The army marched overland, advancing within of Drewry's Bluff by May 9. From a tactical perspective, Bermuda Hundred allowed a complete amphibious landing with less likelihood of counterattack than a landing five miles closer to Drewry's Bluff and Fort Darling.

Early life Of noble Russian parentage, Seversky was born in Tiflis, Russian Empire (now Tbilisi, Georgia). He entered a military school at age 10. Seversky's father was one of the first Russian aviators to own an aircraft (a modified Bl√©riot XI built by Mikheil Grigorashvili) and by the age of 14, when Seversky entered the Imperial Russian Naval Academy, his father had already taught him how to fly. Graduating in 1914 with an engineering degree, Lieutenant Seversky was serving at sea with a destroyer flotilla when World War I began.De Seversky 1961, p. 15. World War I Seversky was selected for duty as a naval aviator, transferring to the Military School of Aeronautics at Sebastopol, Crimea. After completing a postgraduate program on aeronautics in 1914‚Äì15, he was reassigned as a pilot in the summer of 1915 to an aviation unit in the Baltic Fleet. While stationed in the Gulf of Riga, on his first mission, he attacked a German destroyer but was shot down by enemy anti-aircraft fire before he could drop his bombs. The bombs exploded in the crash, killing his observer and badly wounding Seversky. Doctors amputated his leg below the knee and although he was fitted with an artificial leg, despite his protests, authorities deemed him unfit to return to combat. To prove to his superiors that he could still fly, Seversky appeared unannounced at an air show, but was quickly arrested following his impromptu spirited aerial performance. Tsar Nicholas II intervened on his behalf and in July 1916, de Seversky returned to combat duty, downing his first enemy aircraft three days later. In February 1917, he assumed command of the 2nd Naval Fighter Detachment, until he was seriously injured in an accident where a horse-drawn wagon broke his good leg. After serving in Moscow, as the Chief of Pursuit Aviation, Seversky returned to combat duty. On October 14, 1916, he was forced down in enemy territory but made it back to the safety of his own lines. He went on to fly 57 combat missions, shooting down six German aircraft (his claims for 13 victories would make him Russia's third-ranking World War I ace, although the claims are disputed). LieutenantAviation encyclopedia \\"–£–≥–æ–ª–æ–∫ –Ω–µ–±–∞\\" (in Russian) Seversky was the leading Russian naval ace in the conflict.Alexander de Seversky For his wartime service, Seversky was awarded the Order of St. George (4th class); Order of St. Vladimir (4th class); Order of St. Stanislaus (2nd & 3rd class); Order of St. Anne (2nd; 3rd; and 4th class). Emigration to United States During the 1917 Revolution, Seversky was stationed in St. Petersburg and remained in uniform at the request of the commander-in-chief of the Baltic Fleet. In March 1918, he was selected as an assistant naval attach√© in the Russian Naval Aviation Mission to the United States. Seversky departed via Siberia and while in the U.S., decided to remain there rather than return to a Russia torn apart by the Revolution.De Seversky 1942, p. 353. Settling in Manhattan, he briefly operated a restaurant.\\"Alexander de Seversky.\\" cradleofaviation.org, The Cradle of Aviation Museum, 2001. Retrieved: May 15, 2009. Aviation career In 1918, Seversky offered his services to the War Department as a pilot. General William Kenly, Chief of the Signal Corps, appointed him as a consulting engineer and test pilot assigned to the Buffalo District of aircraft production. After the Armistice, Seversky became an assistant to air power advocate General Billy Mitchell, aiding him in his push to prove air power's ability to sink battleships. Seversky applied for and received the first patent for air-to-air refueling in 1921. Over the next few years, 364 patent claims were made, among them the first gyroscopically stabilized bombsight, which Seversky developed with Sperry Gyroscope Company in 1923. After joining the Army Air Corps Reserve, Seversky was commissioned a major in 1928. Seversky Aircraft Corporation Using the $50,000 from the sale of his bombsight to the U. S. Government, Seversky founded the Seversky Aero Corporation in 1923. Concentrating on making aircraft parts and instruments, the small company was unable to survive the stock market crash of 1929. On February 16, 1931, with the backing of Wall Street millionaire Edward Moore and other investors, he resurrected the enterprise as the new Seversky Aircraft Corporation in Long Island, New York.Boyne 1968, p. 28. Moving into the former EDO Aircraft Corporation's float plane factory at College Point, Long Island, Seversky's patents were the primary assets of the new company. Resolved to invest in research and design rather than relying on licence- manufacturing, many of Seversky Aircraft's designers were Russian and Georgian engineers, including Chief Engineer Michael Gregor and Alexander Kartveli. Along with Seversky, the designers embarked on an advanced all-metal, multi- place monoplane amphibian, the SEV-3. This ground-breaking design would go on to set numerous speed records at the 1933‚Äì1939 National Air Races, often piloted by Seversky himself, who was the company's greatest \\"pitchman\\". On September 15, 1935, flying at a speed just over 230 mph, Seversky set a world speed record for piston-engine amphibious aircraft.Rumerman, Judy.\\"Alexander de Seversky and Seversky Aircraft.\\"US Centennial of Flight Commission, 2003. Retrieved: December 9, 2014. Seversky also set a transcontinental speed record in 1938. Alexander de Seversky standing before the SEV-3XAR, autumn 1934 The SEV-3 was eventually the progenitor of a family of advanced aircraft including the SEV-3XLR and 2-XP (two-place, experimental) fighter, the BT-8 trainer and SEV-1P (single-seat) fighter. The most radical conversion occurred when the fixed-gear SEV-1P was fitted with a rearward retracting main undercarriage to produce the prototype of the successful P-35A fighter series. The Seversky Aircraft design office led by Seversky was responsible for 25 different innovative projects, many of them \\"still-born\\" including the \\"Seversky Super- Clipper\\", an eight-engine, 250 ft span transoceanic transport and the four- place, tricycle gear \\"Seversky Executive\\" high speed personal aircraft. The Sev-S2, virtually identical to the P-35, which was undergoing trials in 1937, dominated the last three Bendix Trophy air races, beginning in 1937 when Frank Fuller won at an average speed of 415.51 km/h. The Seversky Aircraft Company began operating out of new facilities in Long Island in 1936, purchasing three factories, a flying field and hangar along with a seaplane assembly base at Famingdale and Amityville, Long Island.\\"Aircraft Firm Buys Long Island Plants; Seversky Gets a Flying Field, Factories and Seaplane Assembly Base.\\" The New York Times, October 17, 1936. Despite landing several government contracts, Seversky Aircraft was never able to turn a profit under Seversky's management and by September 1938, the company had to be bailed out again by Paul Moore (Edward's brother and heir). His financing of a rescue came with the proviso that Seversky, as President, would have his personal budget cut, while the board of directors transferred more power to managing director Wallace Kellett. A controversial contract Seversky negotiated in secret with the Japanese for 20 SEV-2PA-B3 fighters created antagonism with the War Department, leading inevitably to the U.S. government putting pressure on the USAAC to limit the P-35 order to the initial batch of 76 aircraft.Hucker 1984, pp. 70‚Äì71. When Seversky left for Europe on a sales tour in the winter of 1938‚Äì39, the Board reorganized the operation on October 13, 1939, renamed as Republic Aviation Corporation with Kellett becoming the new president. Seversky sued for redress but while legal actions dragged on, the board of directors voted him out of the company he had created. Republic Aviation would become an industrial behemoth during World War II designing and producing the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and in postwar years, a continuing line of successful fighter aircraft before being acquired by Fairchild in 1965.\\"Alexander de Seversky, Russian Ace of World War One, Aircraft Designer & Founder of Republic Aviation.\\"acepilots.com, 2003. Retrieved: May 16, 2009. Air power advocate As World War II approached, Seversky became engrossed in formulating his theories of air warfare. Shortly after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, he wrote Victory Through Air Power, published in April 1942, advocating the strategic use of air bombardment. The best-selling book (No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, appearing first in mid-August 1942 and remaining in first place for four weeks) with five million copies sold. The book's popularity and hard-hitting message led to Walt Disney adapting the book into an animated motion picture (1943) of the same name where Seversky (who also served as the film's technical consultant) provided live-action commentary.Markstein, Don. \\"Victory Through Air Power.\\" Don Markstein's Toonopedia, 2008. Retrieved: May 16, 2009. The Disney animated film received a lukewarm reception at the box office and from critics who felt it was an unusual departure from the standard Disney studio fare, sending out a powerful propaganda message based on an abstract political argument. The influence of both the book and film in wartime, however, was significant, stimulating popular awareness and driving the national debate on strategic air power.Watts 2001, pp. 234‚Äì235. Seversky was one of a number of strategic air advocates whose vision was realized in the 1946 creation of the Strategic Air Command and the development of aircraft such as the Convair B-36 and Boeing B-47 Stratojet. Seversky continued to publicize his ideas for innovative aircraft and weaponry, notably the 1964 Ionocraft which was to be a single-man aircraft powered by the ionic wind from a high-voltage discharge. A laboratory demonstration was acknowledged to require 90 watts to lift a two-ounce (60 g) model, and no man-carrying version was ever built. In postwar years, Seversky continued to lecture and write about aviation and the strategic use of air power, following up his landmark treatise with Air Power: Key to Survival (1950) and America: Too Young to Die! (1961). Personal life Seversky married New Orleans socialite Evelyn Olliphant (1907‚Äì1967) in 1923. She was also well known as a pilot.

On May 27, elements of Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps extended north to protect the right flank of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Union Army of the Potomac. Porter's objective was to deal with a Confederate force near Hanover Court House, which threatened the avenue of approach for Union reinforcements that were marching south from Fredericksburg. The smaller Confederate force, under Colonel Lawrence O'Bryan Branch, was defeated at Peake's Crossing after a disorganized fight. The Union victory was moot, however, for the Union reinforcements were recalled to Fredericksburg upon word of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks's rout in the Shenandoah Valley at First Winchester. Background Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston withdrew his 60,000-man army from the Virginia Peninsula as McClellan's army pursued him and approached the Confederate capital of Richmond. Johnston's defensive line began at the James River at Drewry's Bluff, site of the recent Confederate naval victory, and extended counterclockwise so that his center and left were behind the Chickahominy River, a natural barrier in the spring when it turned the broad plains to the east of Richmond into swamps. Johnston's men burned most of the bridges over the Chickahominy and settled into strong defensive positions north and east of the city. McClellan positioned his 105,000-man army to focus on the northeast sector, for two reasons. First, the Pamunkey River, which ran roughly parallel to the Chickahominy, offered a line of communication that could enable McClellan to get around Johnston's left flank. Second, McClellan anticipated the arrival of the I Corps under Maj. Gen. Irwin McDowell, scheduled to march south from Fredericksburg to reinforce his army, and thus needed to protect their avenue of approach.Salmon, p. 88; Eicher, pp. 273-74; Sears, pp. 95-97. Peninsula Campaign, map of events up to the Battle of Seven Pines. The Army of the Potomac pushed slowly up the Pamunkey, establishing supply bases at Eltham's Landing, Cumberland Landing, and White House Landing. White House, the plantation of W.H.F. \\"Rooney\\" Lee, son of General Robert E. Lee, became McClellan's base of operations. Using the Richmond and York River Railroad, McClellan could bring his heavy siege artillery to the outskirts of Richmond. He moved slowly and deliberately, reacting to faulty intelligence that led him to believe the Confederates outnumbered him significantly. By the end of May, the army had built bridges across the Chickahominy and was facing Richmond, straddling the river, with one third of the Army south of the river, two thirds north. (This disposition, which made it difficult for one part of the army to reinforce the other quickly, would prove to be a significant problem in the upcoming Battle of Seven Pines).Salmon, p. 90; Sears, pp. 104-06. While skirmishing occurred all along the line between the armies, McClellan heard a rumor from a Virginia civilian that a Confederate force of 17,000 was moving to Hanover Court House, north of Mechanicsville. If this were true, it would threaten the army's right flank and complicate the arrival of McDowell's reinforcements. A Union cavalry reconnaissance adjusted the estimate of the enemy strength to be 6,000, but it was still cause for concern. McClellan ordered his close friend, Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter, commander of the newly formed V Corps, to deal with the threat.Salmon, p. 90; Sears, pp. 113-14. Porter departed on his mission at 4 a.m. on May 27 with his 1st Division, under Brig. Gen. George W. Morell, the 3rd Brigade of Brig. Gen. George Sykes's 2nd Division, under Colonel Gouverneur K. Warren, and a composite brigade of cavalry and artillery led by Brig. Gen. William H. Emory, altogether about 12,000 men. The Confederate force, which actually numbered about 4,000 men, was led by Col. Lawrence O'Bryan Branch, and included the 7th, 18th, 28th, and 37th North Carolina Infantry regiments, and the 45th Georgia Infantry. They had departed from Gordonsville to guard the Virginia Central Railroad, taking up position at Peake's Crossing, southwest of the courthouse, near Slash Church. Another Confederate brigade was stationed north at Hanover Junction.Eicher, p. 275; Salmon, p. 90. Battle Map Illustrating the Battle of Hanover, Virginia. Engagement Near Hanover Court-House, Virginia. Porter's men approached Peake's Crossing in a driving rain. At about noon on May 27, his lead element, the 25th New York Infantry, encountered Col. James H. Lane's 28th North Carolina on a reconnaissance patrol at the farm owned by Dr. Thomas H. Kinney. The New Yorkers, along with the 1st U.S. Sharpshooters, skirmished briskly with the Confederates until Porter's main body arrived, driving the outnumbered Rebels up the road in the direction of the courthouse. Porter set out in pursuit with most of his force, leaving three regiments (the 2nd Maine, the 44th New York, and the damaged 25th New York), under the command of Brig. Gen. John H. Martindale, to guard the New Bridge and Hanover Court House Roads intersection, a mile to the west of Kinney's farm. This movement exposed the rear of Porter's command to attack by the bulk of Branch's force, which Porter had mistakenly assumed was at Hanover Court House.Sears, p. 114; Salmon, pp. 90-91. Branch also made a poor assumption--that Porter's force was significantly smaller than it turned out to be--and attacked. Col. Charles C. Lee led his own regiment, the 37th North Carolina, along with the 18th North Carolina and two cannons from Latham's Battery. An initial assault by the 18th was repulsed, but when the 37th joined in, Martindale's force was almost destroyed by the heavy fire. The 44th New York suffered 25% casualties and its battle flag received 44 bullet holes.Sears, p. 116; Salmon, p. 91. When messengers reached Porter with news of the engagement, he quickly dispatched the 9th Massachusetts and 62nd Pennsylvania regiments back to the Kinney Farm. The Confederate line broke under the weight of thousands of new troops and they retreated back through Peake's Crossing to Ashland. Aftermath General McClellan claimed that Hanover Court House was yet another \\"glorious victory over superior numbers\\" and judged that it was \\"one of the handsomest things of the war.\\"Sears, p. 117. However, the reality of the outcome was that superior (Union) numbers won the day in a disorganized fight, characterized by misjudgments on both sides. The right flank of the Union army remained secure, although technically the Confederates at Peake's Crossing had not intended to threaten it. And McDowell's Corps did not need its roads kept clear because it never arrived-- the defeat of Union forces at the First Battle of Winchester by Stonewall Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley caused the Lincoln administration to recall McDowell to Fredericksburg. The estimates of Union casualties vary, from 355 (62 killed, 233 wounded, 70 captured) to 397. The Confederates left 200 dead and wounded on the field and 730 were captured by Porter's cavalry.Eicher, 276; Sears, p. 117; Salmon, p. 91; Kennedy, p. 92. A greater impact than the actual casualties, according to historian Stephen W. Sears, was the effect on McClellan's preparedness for the next major battle, at Seven Pines and Fair Oaks four days later. During the absence of Porter, McClellan was reluctant to move more of his troops south of the Chickahominy, making his left flank a more attractive target for Johnston.

B., & Nurwansah, I. (2020). L2/20-256 Preliminary Proposal to encode Kawi in the UCS. The script is an abugida meaning that characters are read with an inherent vowel. Diacritics are used, either to suppress the vowel and represent a pure consonant, or to represent other vowels.De Casparis, J. G. Indonesian Palaeography: A History of Writing in Indonesia from the beginnings to c. AD 1500, Leiden/Koln, 1975, pp. 35-42 with footnotes History The Kawi script is related to the Nagari or old- Devanagari script in India. Also called the Prae-Nagari in Dutch publications after the classic work of F.D.K. Bosch on early Indonesian scripts, the early- Nagari form of script was primarily used in the Kawi script form to write southeast Asian Sanskrit and Old Javanese language in central and eastern Java. Kawi is the ancestor of traditional Indonesian scripts, such as Javanese and Balinese, as well as traditional Philippine scripts such as Luzon Kavi the ancient scripts of Laguna Copperplate Inscriptions 822 A.D. and The Baybayin 1500 AD. The strongest evidence of Nagari influence is found in the Sanur stone inscription found in South Bali, which consists of texts in two scripts: one in Early Nagari and the other in Early Kawi script. Further, the Sanur inscription overlaps into two languages ‚Äì Sanskrit and Old Balinese. Of these, the Old Balinese language portion of the text is expressed in both Early Nagari and Early Kawi script. This inscription is likely from 914 CE, and its features are similar to the earliest forms of Kawi script found in the central and eastern regions of the Bali's neighboring island of Java.De Casparis, J. G. Indonesian Palaeography: A History of Writing in Indonesia from the beginnings to c. AD 1500, Leiden/Koln, 1975, pp. 36-37 with footnotes According to de Casparis, the early Nagari-inspired Kawi script thrived for over three centuries between the 7th- and 10th-century, and after 910 CE, the later Kawi script emerged incorporating regional innovations and South Indian influence (which in itself is influenced in part by Brahmi-Nandinagari). The four stages of Kawi script evolution are 910‚Äì950 CE (east Javanese Kawi I), 1019-1042 (east Javanese Kawi II), 1100‚Äì1220 (east Javanese Kawi III), 1050‚Äì1220 (square script of the Kediri period).De Casparis, J. G. Indonesian Palaeography: A History of Writing in Indonesia from the beginnings to c. AD 1500, Leiden/Koln, 1975, pp. 38-43 with footnotes The earliest known texts in Kawi date from the Singhasari kingdom in eastern Java. The more recent scripts were extant in the Majapahit kingdom, also in eastern Java, Bali, Borneo and Sumatra. The Kawi script has attracted scholarly interest both in terms of the history of language and script diffusion, as well as the possible routes for the migration of Buddhism and Hinduism to southeast Asian region because many of the major scripts of southeast Asia show South Indian Pallava script influence. The modern Javanese script, state George Campbell and Christopher Moseley, emerged in part through the modification of the Kawi script over the medieval era. This modification occurred in part via secondary forms called pasangan in Javanese, and also from changes in shape. It also shows influence of the northern and western Javanese script forms based on the Pallava Grantha script found in Tamil Nadu as well as the Arabic and Roman script with changes in theo-political control of Java and nearby islands from the 14th- to 20th- century. Examples A well-known document written in Kawi is the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, found in 1989 in Laguna de Bay near Manila, Philippines. It has inscribed on it a date of Saka era 822, corresponding to May 10, 900 AD,Laguna Copperplate Inscription - Article in English and is written in Old Malay containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between Old Javanese and Old Tagalog.Postma, Antoon.

It has been replaced by ISO/IEC 25010:2011. The quality criteria according to ISO 9126 The fundamental objective of the ISO/IEC 9126 standard is to address some of the well known human biases that can adversely affect the delivery and perception of a software development project. These biases include changing priorities after the start of a project or not having any clear definitions of \\"success\\". By clarifying, then agreeing on the project priorities and subsequently converting abstract priorities (compliance) to measurable values (output data can be validated against schema X with zero intervention), ISO/IEC 9126 tries to develop a common understanding of the project's objectives and goals. The standard is divided into four parts: * quality model * external metrics * internal metrics * quality in use metrics. Quality The quality model presented in the first part of the standard, ISO/IEC 9126-1, classifies software quality in a structured set of characteristics and sub- characteristics as follows: * Functionality - \\"A set of attributes that bear on the existence of a set of functions and their specified properties. The functions are those that satisfy stated or implied needs.\\" ** Suitability ** Accuracy ** Interoperability ** Security ** Functionality compliance * Reliability - \\"A set of attributes that bear on the capability of software to maintain its level of performance under stated conditions for a stated period of time.\\" ** Maturity ** Fault tolerance ** Recoverability ** Reliability compliance * Usability - \\"A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed for use, and on the individual assessment of such use, by a stated or implied set of users.\\" ** Understandability ** Learnability ** Operability ** Attractiveness ** Usability compliance * Efficiency - \\"A set of attributes that bear on the relationship between the level of performance of the software and the amount of resources used, under stated conditions.\\" ** Time behaviour ** Resource utilization ** Efficiency compliance * Maintainability - \\"A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed to make specified modifications.\\" ** Analyzability ** Changeability ** Stability ** Testability ** Maintainability compliance * Portability - \\"A set of attributes that bear on the ability of software to be transferred from one environment to another.\\" ** Adaptability ** Installability ** Co-existence ** Replaceability ** Portability compliance Each quality sub-characteristic (e.g. adaptability) is further divided into attributes. An attribute is an entity which can be verified or measured in the software product. Attributes are not defined in the standard, as they vary between different software products. Software product is defined in a broad sense: it encompasses executables, source code, architecture descriptions, and so on. As a result, the notion of user extends to operators as well as to programmers, which are users of components such as software libraries. The standard provides a framework for organizations to define a quality model for a software product. On doing so, however, it leaves up to each organization the task of specifying precisely its own model. This may be done, for example, by specifying target values for quality metrics which evaluates the degree of presence of quality attributes. Internal Metrics Internal metrics are those which do not rely on software execution (static measure). External metrics External metrics are applicable to running software. Quality-in- use metrics Quality-in-use metrics are only available when the final product is used in real conditions. Ideally, the internal quality determines the external quality and external quality determines quality in use. This standard stems from the GE model for describing software quality, presented in 1977 by McCall et al., which is organized around three types of quality characteristic: * Factors (to specify): They describe the external view of the software, as viewed by the users. * Criteria (to build): They describe the internal view of the software, as seen by the developer. * Metrics (to control): They are defined and used to provide a scale and method for measurement. ISO/IEC 9126 distinguishes between a defect and a nonconformity, a defect being \\"The nonfulfilment of intended usage requirements\\", whereas a nonconformity is \\"The nonfulfilment of specified requirements\\". A similar distinction is made between validation and verification, known as V&V; in the testing trade. History ISO/IEC 9126 was issued on December 19, 1991. On June 15, 2001, ISO/IEC 9126:1991 was replaced by ISO/IEC 9126:2001 (four parts 9126-1 to 9126-4). On March 1, 2011, ISO/IEC 9126 was replaced by ISO/IEC 25010:2011 Systems and software engineering - Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) - System and software quality models. Compared to 9126, \\"security\\" and \\"compatibility\\" were added as main characteristics. Developments ISO/IEC then started work on SQuaRE (Software product Quality Requirements and Evaluation), a more extensive series of standards to replace ISO/IEC 9126, with numbers of the form ISO/IEC 250mn. For instance, ISO/IEC 25000 was issued in 2005, and ISO/IEC 25010, which supersedes ISO/IEC 9126-1, was issued in March 2011. ISO 25010 has eight product quality characteristics (in contrast to ISO 9126's six), and 31 subcharacteristics. * \\"Functionality\\" is renamed \\"functional suitability\\". \\"Functional completeness\\" is added as a subcharacteristic, and \\"interoperability\\" and \\"security\\" are moved elsewhere. \\"Accuracy\\" is renamed \\"functional correctness\\", and \\"suitability\\" is renamed \\"functional appropriateness\\". * \\"Efficiency\\" is renamed \\"performance efficiency\\". \\"Capacity\\" is added as a subcharactersitic. * \\"Compatibility\\" is a new characteristic, with \\"co-existence\\" moved from \\"portability\\" and \\"interoperability\\" moved from \\"functionality\\". * \\"Usability\\" has new subcharacteristics of \\"user error protection\\" and \\"accessibility\\" (use by people with a wide range of characteristics). \\"Understandability\\" is renamed \\"appropriateness recognizability\\", and \\"attractiveness\\" is renamed \\"user interface aesthetics\\". * \\"Reliability\\" has a new subcharacteristic of \\"availability\\" (when required for use). * \\"Security\\" is a new characteristic with subcharacteristics of \\"confidentiality\\" (data accessible only by those authorized), \\"integrity\\" (protection from unauthorized modification), \\"non- repudiation\\" (actions can be proven to have taken place), \\"accountability\\" (actions can be traced to who did them), and \\"authenticity\\" (identity can be proved to be the one claimed). * \\"Maintainability\\" has new subcharacteristics of \\"modularity\\" (changes in one component have a minimal impact on others) and \\"reusability\\"; \\"changeability\\" and \\"stability\\" are rolled up into \\"modifiability\\". * \\"Portability\\" has \\"co-existence\\" moved elsewhere.

Originally broadcasting on analog 104.1 MHz (now WWBX) from 1968 to 2009, and later broadcasting as a digital-only radio station, airing on WBZ-FM HD2 from 2009 to 2017. In December 2017, owner Beasley Broadcast Group discontinued WBCN, switching the station's format to \\"Hubcast\\", a replay of segments and podcasts from air personalities of the Sports Talk format of WBZ-FM. Before switching to 98.5 HD2 on August 12, 2009, WBCN featured its rock format for 41 years as an analog radio station on 104.1 MHz. WBCN became a legend in the rock music industry for breaking many bands, most notably U2. WBCN was a modern rock/active rock station that mixed music that has been popular in the modern rock, alternative rock and classic rock genres. Known as \\"The Rock of Boston\\", its three main Boston-area competitors were Album Oriented Rock/active rock WAAF and alternative music stations WBOS and WFNX. The station switched to digital only on August 12, 2009, with two digital-only automated streams, one continuing the modern rock format, the other Free Form BCN, airing an eclectic mix of rock, related genres, and a lot of new music - essentially the WBCN of 1968 to 1988, brought into the 21st Century. The station's battle of the bands' competition, the Rock 'n' Roll Rumble, survived the station's demise. WBCN's celebrated local music specialty show, Boston Emissions‚Äîalong with The Rumble‚Äîmoved to sister station WZLX in 2009. Boston DJ Anngelle Woodhttp://wzlx.radio.com/category/rock-and-roll-rumble/ remains the host and music director of both the radio show and The Rumble‚Äîthese are the last remaining ties to the original 104.1 WBCN programming.http://wzlx.radio.com/show/boston-emissions/ \\"Free Form BCN\\" began airing live freeform shows in September 2009 on WZLX-HD3 and at wbcn.com. While still digital and largely automated, the online stream was live Monday through Friday during the day. WBCN's first rock program director, Sam Kopper, was Program Director of WBCN Free Form Rock until being discontinued on January 29, 2016. History Before the mid-1960s, the station played classical music exclusively. The call sign stood for the Boston Concert Network (along with Hartford's WHCN and New York's WNCN). One of the on-air personalities at that time was Ron Della Chiesa, who also served as the music host and program director. Della Chiesa is still active in classical music broadcasting on WCRB. In 1965, Nathaniel Johnson was appointed Music Director of WBCN by station program director Don Otto. Johnson remained with the station until 1967, just prior to the changeover from classical to easy- listening, and then to rock. Johnson then left WBCN to assume a new position at WGBH.http://www.wbcn.com/pages/3538343.php Golden age of WBCN The station slowly began to change to an \\"underground\\" progressive rock format on the night of March 15, 1968. BCN's first rock announcer, \\"Mississippi Harold Wilson\\" (Joe Rogers), used the station's first slogan, \\"The American Revolution\\" and played the very first song \\"I Feel Free\\" by the rock group Cream. At first, the new \\"American Revolution\\" format was only heard during the late-evening and overnight hours, but in mid-May, the station expanded the rock programming to 24 hours a day. By June 1968, the station's air staff included Mississippi, Peter Wolf (who was just starting with the J. Geils Band), Tommy Hadges, Jim Parry, Al Perry, and Sam Kopper was joined by Steven \\"The Seagull\\" Segal. Segal's arrival was critical to the station's early development since he came in from Los Angeles and San Francisco, where he had been mentored by the legendary West Coast DJ Tom Donahue, who was credited with starting the very first underground rock FM station at KMPX the year before. Segal's West Coast radical radio consciousness infused the early 'BCN. In the summer of 1968, Kopper was made the station's first program director. That fall, Segal and Kopper hired J.J. Jackson as a disc jockey. Twelve years later, JJ would become one of MTV's first VJs. In December 1968, Peter Wolf left to take the J. Geils Band full-time and, introduced to the station by Jim Parry, Charles Laquidara was hired to take over the 10p.m. to 2a.m. air shift. Between late 1968 and early 1971, as program director, Kopper sought out and hired Norm Winer, recently graduated from Brandeis; Andy Beaubien, recently graduated from URI; and Maxanne Sartori, who came in from her DJ position at KOL-FM in Seattle. WBCN began supporting non-mainstream investigative reporting and alternative news coverage, including reports from demonstrations and highly produced montage news reports. The news department was initially headed by Norm Winer, who later became program director. For a brief period during that transition, Charles Laquidara, who was acting program director hired Robert \\"Bo\\" Burlingham as news director. Bo resigned shortly thereafter when his name appeared on a UPI news wire as one of several people being indicted by then-Attorney General John Mitchell‚Äîa charge which was later dropped. Danny Schechter replaced Bo Burlingham and immediately billed himself as \\"the News Dissector\\". Along with Andrew Kopkind, John Scagliotti, Bill Lichtenstein, and Marsha Steinberg, the news department evolved radically, introducing such novel concepts as a show oriented toward prison inmates, health warnings about the hazards of street drugs, a lost pet-finding service called the Cat and Dog Report, a travelers' aid service called the Travelers' Friend, live updates on the traffic problems at Woodstock, and by 1970, live- to-air concert broadcasts. WBCN's programming in 1971-72http://bspurlin.wordpress.com bore little relationship to the Billboard Hot 100 or any other conventional programming. Classical music, jazz, or anything else might be played, as long as the skillful DJs could make it work. For the first time, the owners of the station began to make a profit. However, there was always tension between the artistic expression of the DJs, and management's need to run a business, resulting in the unionization of the station with the United Electrical Workers in 1971. Popular legend holds that WBCN was sent a promotional copy of The Beatles' unreleased Get Back album and played it on the air before the release of the album was cancelled. The \\"album\\" had been compiled out of material the Beatles recorded in London in January 1969, the same sessions that would be used to create the Beatles' Let It Be album which was released in May 1970. While the existence of the promotional album is apocryphal, the truth behind the broadcast, though less dramatic, is equally as fascinating. In late summer of 1969, WBCN somehow obtained a reel-to-reel tape of a reference acetate of a potential album song lineup prepared by Beatles' engineer Glyn Johns on March 10, 1969. WBCN aired the tape on September 22, 1969. Although WBCN was not the only radio station, or even the first station, to air material from the Get Back sessions ‚Äî WKBW in Buffalo was the first, and the tapes also aired on WEBN in Cincinnati, WBAI in New York City, and KCOK in St. Louis ‚Äî WBCN's broadcast of the tapes has been immortalized because it was preserved on a high-quality reel, which spawned several widely circulated Beatles bootlegs. By 1975, WBCN had gradually evolved from the underground/progressive format of the 1960s to the more mainstream album oriented rock format popular in the 1970s. Unlike most rock stations of the era, WBCN still allowed a degree of individual DJ control of the music. Their playlist in general was more varied than many of their competitors, there was some focus on local music (also see the WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble), and the station was known nationwide for breaking acts (The Cars, 'Til Tuesday, U2) and setting trends. Oedipus (who had the first punk rock show in the country while at MIT's college station, WTBS) was hired first as a DJ in 1977, and then installed as program director in 1981, and helped to break The Ramones, The Clash, The Police, and countless punk and new wave bands out of Boston. In the period around 1975, John Garabedian, now recognized for the nationally syndicated \\"Open House Party\\" (which was once heard locally on WXKS-FM), was an afternoon DJ on WBCN. In 1979, the station was purchased by Hemisphere Broadcasting, who let go several longtime employees who they determined \\"non-essential.\\" This set off a local controversy in Boston that resulted in the entire airstaff walking off the air striking in protest. During the walkout, WBCN stayed on the air with substitute DJs imported from several out-of-town Hemisphere sister stations. The protest got local media coverage and the attention of several well-known Boston-based music acts, including The Cars, Aerosmith, and Boston, who got behind the protest. When several large advertisers pulled spots, and the union filed a challenge to Hemisphere's license (pointing out that by forcing the staff out on strike, Hemisphere had created a situation where it couldn't provide the public service it was required to), Hemisphere relented, the fired staffers were rehired and the DJs went back on the air. (It was also rumored that Hemisphere's FCC lawyers had vetoed the course of action advised by Hemisphere's labor lawyers.) Charles Laquidara played Superman by The Kinks back to back for an entire show in celebration. By the mid-1980s, WBCN had successfully fended off a number of challengers (the hard rocking but tightly formatted WCOZ, Top 40 Hitradio WHTT, Classic Rock WZLX, among others) to become/remain the region's top rock station. Many of the DJs, particularly morning \\"Big Mattress\\" host Charles Laquidara, were now local quasi- celebrities. Laquidara had Billy West on the show on a daily basis, as well as Karlos, the first computer-generated (using Digital Equipment's DECtalk) on- air personality in radio history. Legendary Boston stripper Princess Cheyenne hosted a Sunday night sex advice show that eventually led to one of her appearances in Playboy Magazine in April 1986. The station was more commercial and \\"programmed\\" by this point, but still retained some of its progressive energy and edge. By the 1990s, WBCN was at a crossroads. With its audience aging, it risked becoming a classic rock-focused station and losing its currency as an outlet for new music. For a long time, WBCN successfully balanced new and old music (featuring the slogan \\"Classic to Cutting Edge\\"). In the early 1990s, the station began airing the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show, but aired it in the evenings on tape delay instead of during morning drive. This allowed them to retain their \\"Big Mattress\\" morning show along with its large and loyal audience. Active rock era In early 1994, WBCN made its first major format adjustment since 1968. The old DJs, station IDs, and classic rock were gutted, replaced by an alternative music format featuring new, younger jocks; on April 1, 1996, the Stern show was moved to mornings. The station lost some of its longtime listeners (who migrated to the now co-owned WZLX, where former WBCN DJs Laquidara and Carter Alan had gone), but quickly gained credibility among many younger people. In the summer of 1999, WBCN moved its format away from strictly alternative music and more towards an active rock-leaning modern rock format. The station by this time was playing some hard rock and Nu metal acts such as Godsmack, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Linkin Park. By the Fall of 2002, certain classic artists, such as Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, and Ozzy Osbourne, were added back in the station's playlist rotation. Much of the station's programming focused on syndicated talk shows (former WAAF personalities Opie & Anthony replacing David Lee Roth, who had previously replaced Howard Stern in morning Drive Time). During the autumn months, WBCN became more focused on sports as the station broadcast the games of the NFL's New England Patriots beginning in 1995. In early 2006, with the Howard Stern morning drive time show gone due to Stern moving to Sirius Satellite Radio, WBCN experienced a plummet in Arbitron ratings that the station had not observed since the late 1970s and early 1980s, when it fell behind then rock format competitor WCOZ. The station started to air the syndicated Opie & Anthony during morning drive. WBCN also launched The Toucher and Rich Show, a new locally produced comedy-based afternoon drive time show starring Fred Toettcher and Rich Shertenlieb. The duo formerly worked together at Atlanta alternative station WNNX. In 2007, the station was nominated for the Top 25 Markets Alternative Station of the Year Award by Radio & Records magazine. Other nominees included KROQ-FM in Los Angeles; KTBZ-FM in Houston; KITS, in San Francisco; KNDD in Seattle; and WWDC in Washington, D.C. In December 2008, the station ceased airing Opie & Anthony in morning drive and moved \\"Toucher and Rich\\" from afternoons.http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/news/messenger/index.php/2008/12/01/wbcn- dumps-opie-anthony/ During the following months, industry insiders, local media, and even WBCN's on air staff speculated that, in a matter of time, WBCN could see a format change, especially after the Boston Herald ran an article in the March 30th, 2009 issue about WBCN's future, and the station airing a Top 40 format for a few hours the following day (April Fool's Day). From 1995 through 2008, WBCN was the flagship station of the Patriots Rock Radio Network, which broadcast games of the New England Patriots. Gil Santos, former WBZ sports reporter, did play-by-play, while Gino Cappelletti, former Patriots star, provided color commentary. With WBCN's dissolution as an analog station, the Patriots flagship station became WBCN's sister station WBZ-FM on August 13, 2009. WBCN goes digital-only On July 14, 2009, CBS Radio announced that WBCN would sign off the 104.1 MHz frequency.http://www.cbsradio.com/press_center/releases/pressrelease105715-07-14-2009.htmlhttp://www.universalhub.com/node/26380 WBCN's last four days on analog radio were celebration and retrospective shows highlighting WBCN's history. Bradley Jay (now host of the weekday overnight talk show, ‚ÄúJay Talking‚Äù, over on AM sister station WBZJay Talking On WBZ NewsRadio 1030) was the last DJ. The last two songs played were Cream's \\"I Feel Free\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", followed by a much- used collage of songs with the line \\"They're really Rockin' in Boston...\\" and station bits and ID spots used over the years, which then slowed to a halt. The final words were from the late Darrell Martinie, the Cosmic Muffin, saying his tag line, \\"Over and Out\\". At 12:05 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on August 12, 2009, the station went into a static-like sound, and after a few moments, a voice read the new station identification: \\"WBMX, WBMX-HD1, Boston\\" over the \\"static\\". The static was broadcast on 104.1 until 2:00 AM. At that time, \\"Mix 98.5\\" officially moved to 104.1, playing \\"Use Somebody\\" by Kings of Leon as their first song after the move. That song was in heavy rotation on WBCN during the months leading up to CBS Radio's announcement of the station's demise, and continued until the four-day farewell began. HD Radio substations on the FM frequencies changed as well: * WBCN's 104.1 analog and HD-1 moved to 98.5 (WBZ-FM) HD-2. * WBCN's Free Form 104, moved from 104.1 HD-2 to 100.7 (WZLX) HD-3 and was renamed Free Form BCN. It was programmed by Sam Kopper, WBCN's first rock program director, and also featured past events from the WBCN archives. * Indie 104.1 on 104.1 HD-3 ceased operations. * WBMX moved all of its subchannels with it from 98.5 to 104.1: Mix on analog and HD-1, The '80s Channel on HD-2, and The Sky on HD-3. This was done to make room for an all-sports talk format at the 98.5 FM frequency, known as 98.5 The Sports Hub WBZ-FM. WBCN's Toucher and Rich morning show began broadcasting on WBZ-FM on August 14, 2009. WBCN's afternoon DJ, Rob Poole, known on air as \\"Hardy\\", announced on his final WBCN show that he will co-host a sports-themed show on WBZ-FM on Saturday mornings. WBCN (in WBZ-FM-HD2 form) formerly transmitted from the tower known locally as ‚ÄúFM-128‚Äù in Newton. It shared a master antenna with WJMN (94.5 Boston), WKLB-FM (102.5 Waltham), along with backup transmitters for WBOS, WBQT, WROR-FM, WMJX, and WXKS-FM.Google Maps In order to keep the intellectual property of WBCN intact, without another station in Boston making claim to it, CBS Radio parked the WBCN call letters on WFNA, a station located at 1660 AM in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Charlotte station was a semi-satellite of WFNZ 610 AM, known then as \\"The Franchise\\", an all sports talk station. The FCC approved the transfer in the spring of 2009. As part of the switch, the WBMX call letters were parked on 1660 AM in Charlotte from July 29, 2009 until WBCN signed off for the last time at 104.1 in Boston on August 12. On September 14, 2009, WBCN (AM) split from WFNZ and became \\"America's Talk\\", a conservative-leaning talk station. It returned to sports programming in 2013 as a full-time satellite of CBS Sports Radio. End of WBCN On February 2, 2017, CBS announced that they will be selling their radio division to Entercom, which could have indirectly made what was WBCN (on WBZ-FM HD2 form) a sister station to long-time rival WAAF. However, the combined company would have to shed some of its Boston stations in order to satisfy Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice requirements. On October 10, 2017, CBS disclosed that as part of the process of obtaining regulatory approval of the merger, WBZ-FM would be one of sixteen stations that would be divested by Entercom, along with sister stations WBZ and WZLX, and Entercom stations WRKO and WKAF, with Entercom retaining WEEI AM and FM, WBMX, WODS and WAAF. On November 1, 2017, Beasley Media Group announced that it would trade WMJX to Entercom, in exchange for WBZ-FM (WBZ, WZLX, WRKO and WKAF were acquired by iHeartMedia).https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/entercom-cbs-radio-justice- department-1202604449/ Entercom Swaps 98.5 the Sports Hub to Beasley for Magic 106.7 Entercom Trades Boston/Seattle Spin-Offs to iHeartMedia for Richmond/Chattanooga The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. Beasley took complete ownership of the station on December 20, 2017. Shortly after the transfer to Beasley was completed, WBCN was replaced with \\"Hubcast\\", a replay of segments and podcasts from air personalities from \\"The Sports Hub.\\" WBCN Free Form Rock on WZLX HD3 WBCN Free Form Rock (originally WBCN Free Form 104, then Free Form BCN) was a digital-only radio station broadcasting on the Internet and in the Boston radio market on WZLX 100.7 HD3. The station, programmed by BCN's original 1969 program director, Sam Kopper, began airing in February 2009 as WBCN Free Form 104, airing, until the demise of the original WBCN, on 104.1 HD2. Since WBCN's change to digital-only, the station was known as Free Form BCN and then WBCN Free Form Rock by late September 2009. WBCN Free Form Rock was formatted essentially the same as WBCN's 104.1 FM's 1968-88 incarnation (a great deal of Rock and Rock's related genres, plus a great deal of new music), and was different from the current 98.5 HD2 version (Modern Rock). \\"WBCN Free Form Rock\\" was formatted to play multiple music genres (including rock, jazz, the blues, and country). WBCN Free Form Rock was advertised to be a replica of the original WBCN format circa 1968 to the early 1990s, playing any song it wants, including rock and relative genres. In late 2009, the station begun to increase its DJ'd programming. While it was automated most of the time, it was increasing its live weekdays, and hinting about the potential for more programming as listenership increased. However, on January 29, 2016, \\"WBCN Free Form Rock\\" was dropped from WZLXHD3 and flipped to adult standards as \\"The Lounge.\\" On December 19, 2017, the HD3 channel was removed.

It is the main centre for Benbecula and the adjacent islands of North Uist, South Uist and several smaller islands. Balivanich is within the parish of South Uist. History The name meaning \\"town of the monk\\" possibly relates to a monastery which may have been founded here as early as during the 6th century. Teampull Chaluim Chille, an ancient church dedicated to Columba, might have been part of this monastery; its remains can still be seen south of the village.Catriona Garbutt, Jean Newman: \\"Teampull Chaluim Chille - Balivanich's Scheduled Monument\\" In: Am P√†ipear - Balivanich - No. 315, April 2012, p. 20‚Äì21. An airfield to the north, built during World War II, became the control centre for the Hebrides rocket range, established in 1957 at the height of the Cold War. It is now Benbecula Airport.

Climate A weather station has collected climate data for the island a short distance northeast at Benbecula airport. As with the rest of the British Isles and Scotland, Balivanich experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters, and is particularly windy due to its position directly facing the North Atlantic. Economy The local council (Comhairle nan Eilean Siar) has offices in Balivanich, and there is also a post office, hospital, primary school and several shops and caf√©s. Transport=Road Balivanich is on the B892 and is connected to the north-south main road, which is the A865. This connects North Uist, Benbecula and South Uist. The village is served by the bus route W17, which operates between Berneray in the north and Eriskay in the south. This service is provided by the local government for the Western Isles (Comhairle nan Eilean Siar) in collaboration with local bus companies and the PostBus service. The buses are regular, but not frequent, due to the low number of inhabitants. Benbecula in Balivanich airport reception building Several private taxi services complement the bus traffic. In addition, there is a scheduled door to door transport service for the elderly and those with restricted mobility, driving to shops, banks, post offices and other important amenities with minibuses. Airport Benbecula Airport (Port Adhair Bheinn na Fadhla) (IATA: BEB, ICAO: EGPL) is located on the northern edge of the village. The operator is the Highlands and Islands Airports Limited based in Inverness. Operations include scheduled flights to the Mainland (Inverness via Stornoway and Glasgow International) and mail cargo flights. In addition, the airport is used, due to its central location close to the hospital, as a landing site for rescue helicopters and aircraft. Some land is also used for the Royal Air Force to refuel and for transport and logistics purposes.

Early life He was born in County Antrim, the son of a Protestant grocer. Although the town of Carrickfergus, where he was born and raised, was strongly Unionist, he joined the Gaelic League as a youth and was won over to the cause of Irish nationalism.The Times, (Obituary) 15 June 1959 As a young man, he joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He worked as a journalist for the North Down Herald and a number of other northern papers before he moved to Dublin, where he found a job at the Freeman's Journal. By 1919, he had risen to its news editor. After the Irish War of Independence, a number of his friends joined the new government of the Irish Free State. Lester was offered and accepted the position as director of publicity. He married Elizabeth Ruth Tyrrell in 1920 by whom he had three daughters. Diplomatic career In 1923, he joined Ireland's Department of External Affairs. He was sent to Geneva in 1929 to replace Michael MacWhite as Ireland's Permanent Delegate to the League of Nations. In 1930, he succeeded in organising Ireland's election to the Council (or executive body) of the League of Nations for a three years. Lester often represented Ireland at Council meetings and stood in for the Minister for External Affairs. He became increasingly involved in the work of the League, particularly in its attempts to bring a resolution to two wars in South America. His work brought him to the attention of the League Secretariat and began his transformation from national to international civil servant. When Peru and Colombia had a dispute over a town in the headwaters of the Amazon, Lester presided over the committee that found an equitable solution. He also presided over the less- successful committee when Bolivia and Paraguay went to war over the Gran Chaco. In 1933, Lester was seconded to the League's Secretariat and sent to Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland), as the League of Nations' High Commissioner from 1934 to 1937. The Free City of Danzig was the scene of an emerging international crisis between Nazi Germany and the international community over the issue of the Polish Corridor and the Free City's relationship with the Third Reich. Lester repeatedly protested to the German government over its persecution and discrimination of Jews and warned the League of the looming disaster for Europe. He was boycotted by the representatives of the German Reich and the representatives of the Nazi Party in Danzig. In August 2010, a room in the Gdansk City Hall, the building that had been Lester's residence during his stay, was renamed by Mayor Pawel Adamowicz as the Se√°n Lester Room. Derek Scally, Irish Times, 27 August 2010 League of Nations Lester returned to Geneva in 1937 to become Deputy Secretary General of the League of Nations. In 1940, he became Secretary General of the body, but the League now had only 100 employees, including guards and janitors, of the original 700. Lester remained in Geneva throughout the war and kept the League's technical and humanitarian programs in limited operation for the duration of the war. In 1946, he oversaw the League's closure and turned over the League's assets and functions to the newly-established United Nations. Later years Despite rumours that he would be prepared to stand for election as President of Ireland, Lester sought no permanent office and retired to Recess, County Galway, in the west of Ireland, where he died. In its obituary, The Times described Lester as an \\"international conciliator and courageous friend of refugees\\". He was given the Woodrow Wilson Award in 1945 and a doctorate of the National University of Ireland in 1948. His granddaughter Susan Denham was Chief Justice of Ireland for the Supreme Court of Ireland from 2011 to 2017.

A costume party (American English) or a fancy dress party (British English) is a type of party, common mainly in contemporary Western culture, where many of the guests are dressed up in costumes. Costumed Halloween parties are popular in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. By country=Australia Australian fancy dress parties typically follows the style of the United States, and Halloween costume parties have been common since the early 1990s, even though Halloween has not historically been a celebrated event in Australia. Typical events for Australians that involve dressing up are the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the staff Christmas party and cricket matches. One of the oldest examples of fancy dress being worn in Australia is on display at the Western Australia Museum. It was a child's fancy dress costume worn by Rita Lloyd, aged nine, to the ‚ÄòLord Mayor‚Äôs Juvenile Fancy Dress Ball‚Äô at Mansion House in Perth on 8 January 1909. Iraq It is a tradition to have a costume party at a university graduation.http://www.niqash.org/en/articles/society/3436/ United KingdomNineteenth century= Manchester fancy dress ball of 1828, painting by Arthur Perigal The origins of fancy dress parties in the United Kingdom can in some respects be traced to masked balls of the 18th century period. In the period to 1850, fancy dress balls were a typical part of the social life of music festivals. Common costumes of the period were specific historical characters, generic historical or regional clothing, abstract concepts (such as \\"winter\\", \\"starlight\\" or \\"night\\"), and objects (such as \\"champagne bottle\\" or \\"aquarium\\"). Popular characters included, for women, Marie Antoinette and Elizabeth I, and for men, Napoleon and Robin Hood. =Twentieth century= Notable amongst early events in the 20th century was the Chelsea Arts Club ball. Such events were often elaborate affairs and for the most part confined to those with considerable means. Amongst the general population, costume parties also occurred with increasing frequency from the late 1940s onward, although for the most part the costumes were simple affairs until the mid-1970s. Prior to 'cheap' costume imports from the Far East / East Asia (late 1990s), most costumes were either hired, or home constructed. Retail purchased costumes are, in respect of the U.K., a largely modern phenomenon (late 1990s onward) although 'accessory' items had been available for some time. Since the increased import rate in the late 1990s onwards saw the many materials / products being imported from the Far East (with cost savings in labour and bulk orders). This has seen the price of purchased costumes becoming more and more affordable. Coupled with the modern trend in costume parties, 'retro' fashion as a costume theme (such as a 1970s or 1980s fancy dress) is also popular, the costumes to some extent parodying or pastiching the fashions of earlier decades. Amongst the most popular parodied costumes are: Audrey Hepburn (as Holly Golightly), Madonna in her classic stage outfits, and more recently Lady Gaga. Fancy dress parties are popular year round in the United Kingdom. The 1996 novel Bridget Jones's Diary features the classic British costume party theme \\"Tarts and Vicars\\" at which the women wear sexually provocative (\\"tart\\") costumes, while the men dress as Anglican priests (\\"vicars\\"). Fancy dress parties have been held by the British Royal Family. Prince William, heir to the British Throne, celebrated his 21st birthday with an \\"Out of Africa\\" theme, Princess Beatrice of York chose an 1888 themed party for her 18th birthday, and Lord Frederick (\\"Freddie\\") Windsor and his sister Lady Gabriella Windsor, celebrated a joint birthday party with a pre-French Revolution courtly theme. United States Contestants line up for a \\"best costume\\" competition at a Halloween party in the United States. =Nineteenth century= In late nineteenth century New York, costume parties were popular amongst the affluent. Costumes were typically historical European aristocracy. Authenticity was important, even extending to using actual period elements. For example, Cornelia Bradley- Martin attended her own party, the notorious Bradley-Martin Ball, dressed as Marie Antoinette, wearing jewellery actually owned and worn by Antoinette herself. The choice of aristocratic costume allowed rich Americans, with relatively limited family history, to assume some element of history and legitimacy. =Twentieth century= Costume parties are especially popular in the United States around Halloween, when teenagers and adults who may be considered too old for trick-or-treating attend a costume party instead. Costume parties are also popular during the carnival season, such as at Mardi Gras. Attendees occasionally dress in costume for popular science fiction and fantasy events, movie openings and book releases. Web site theonering.net held a The Lord of the Rings dress Oscar party that was attended by Peter Jackson. Star Wars parties were held to celebrate the opening of Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. Many bookstores have held Harry Potter themed parties to celebrate the releases of the series' later novels, and some movie theaters have had Potter-themed celebrations as the movie adaptations have been released. Larger scale 'parties' are often related to organised societies or conventions. Fan costuming The hobby of fan costuming and modern cosplay largely developed from the World Science Fiction Conventions (Worldcons), starting with the first in New York in 1939 when two attendees, Forrest J Ackerman and Myrtle R. Douglas, wore \\"futuristicostumes\\". From the 2nd World Science Fiction Convention (1940) in Chicago, masquerade balls were a traditional feature of the convention. Conventions Fan conventions, often abbreviated to \\"cons\\", of various descriptions have followed the example of the Worldcons with many attendees wearing costumes representing fictional characters. Some conventions feature costume competitions and other scheduled costuming events. Several well-known conventions that feature costuming include the San Diego Comic-Con International, New York Comic Con, and Atlanta's Dragon Con. Cosplay Cosplay (a blend of \\"costume\\" and \\"play\\" via the Japanese ) was coined by Nobuyuki Takahashi in reporting on the 42nd World Science Fiction Convention for Japanese magazine My Anime. It is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes, wigs and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplay is popular at conventions across the world. An example of a major cosplay convention in the United States would be Anime Expo, held annually in Los Angeles, California.  Events and themes  There are many annual events that generate the chance to dress up in fancy dress costumes; Christmas, New Year, birthdays, Hen and Stag parties, and Book Day, amongst others. Halloween is the most popular costume or fancy dress event of the year in western society. Halloween originated centuries ago, the Celts believed that on 31 October the line between the living and the dead became distorted, condemned souls would come back to wreak havoc for the night. In defense, the Celts would dress up in ghoulish costumes to scare evil spirits away. Within many fancy dress events, a theme is usually present, and with fancy dress outfits often from Hollywood films such as Star Wars, Grease, James Bond, and Spider-Man. Themes are also extremely popular with fundraising events, such as the Great Gorilla Run, where 1,000 people dressed as gorillas in London in aid for Great Gorillas, a charity that focuses on the endangered species. Some costume parties are themed around 80s fashion. The most popular costumes researched for such fancy dress are the Madonna Look, punk fashion and neon-colored clothing. Some of the easiest and cheapest 1980s costumes include Rambo, Samantha Fox, and Tom Cruise from Risky Business or Top Gun. Alternative eighties costumes include dresses, prom dresses and denim from the period, including high waisted pants and stone wash denim. Fans sometimes attend sporting events in a costume as a sign of support of their favored team. Some sporting events have large numbers of fans attending in fancy dress costume. Examples include Wellington Rugby Sevens, where almost every fan who attends wears some sort of costume, and San Jose Bike Party, where each month's ride has a different theme encouraging riders to come in costume.

It is bounded by the Western Water Catchment to its north, Pioneer to its east and the Straits of Johor to its west. Tuas also shares a maritime boundary with the Western Islands planning area to its east. The Malaysia‚ÄìSingapore Second Link that links Singapore to Malaysia is located in Tuas. Etymology Tuas is derived from a daytime fishing method uncommon today. The coastal Malays floated coconut fronds and leafy branches kept close together by the rising tide. A large net was then spread and suspended below. The shade provided drew in the fish. More and more were attracted until, at a given signal, the net was hauled up by the Malay fishermen in the boats. Levering or hauling up is menuas, without the noun-building suffix of me-, the Malay word is tuas. Tuas also means \\"to chop in two pieces\\", \\"to raise by leverage\\", and \\"to support\\" in Malay. History The Tuas area in the early nineteenth century was referred to by three place names: Tg Kampong, Tg Rawa and Tg Gull ‚Äî references made in Franklin and Jackson's 1830 map of Singapore. Tg is the abbreviation for tanjung or tanjong (Malay for cape). Tuas used to be swampland which was later cleared for squatter settlement. By the mid twentieth century, it became a fishing village. In the old days, it was not unusual to see about 200 fishing boats in Tuas every morning. In the 1970s, the residents in Tuas were resettled to public housing estates. Tuas was then developed for industrial use. In the 1980s, land was reclaimed off Tuas for more industrial development. By 1988, about 6.5 km¬≤ of land off Tuas were reclaimed. Land reclamation off Tuas is still ongoing; the land area of Tuas increased from 17.02 km¬≤ in 1996 to 30.04 km¬≤ presently. Penta-Ocean Construction was the main construction firm involved in the land reclamation. The peninsular formed from the late 1980s to early 1990s is known as Tuas South, while the land currently being reclaimed to the southeast of Tuas Jetty is known as the Tuas View Extension. Industry Being far away from the main residential areas and the commercial district of Singapore, Tuas was chosen as a site for industrial development as the adjacent industrial areas in Jurong Industrial Estate were being built. Heavy industries can be found in Tuas, although not as much as on Jurong Island. Two of Singapore's four incinerators are also found in Tuas, namely Tuas Incinerator and Tuas South Incinerator. A world- scale renewable diesel plant, using palm oil as feedstock, which was completed in 2010, is also located in the area. Its capacity will make it the largest plant of its kind (800,000 tons per annum). Further reclamation as part of the Tuas South extension is being done to house the world's largest storage of oil. Tuas mega port will be completed by 2040 to house all of PSA current assets and operations, PSA will give up its city terminals by 2027 and Pasir Panjang Terminal by 2040.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/singapore-needs-tuas- mega-port-maritime-trade-automated-9934474 Tanjong Pagar terminal had ceased operations in October 2017 marking the beginning of the end of an era of port operation in the area which dates back to the modern founding of Singapore in 1819.http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/world-record-set-at-tanjong-pagar- terminal-to-mark-end-of-an-era-of-port-operations-there Residential areas Tuas has a number of residential buildings provided at low cost for the people who work there. Some are located at Benoi Sector, which also has an eating place, whilst the others are located at Pioneer Road. The low rise flats are normally named from Blocks A to H, and are usually 9 to 11 stories high. They are built to meet basic residential requirements; they provide shelter with an electricity and water supply.

It is situated in the suburb of Mossley Hill in the south of the city, close to Penny Lane and Sefton Park. Historical background The area was the former home of the Rathbone family, philanthropists through two centuries. The family acquired nearby Greenbank House in 1788 as a holiday house and remained there until 1940. Gradually it became their permanent residence and a venue for many distinguished visitors to Liverpool who \\"had some special opinion to propagate or philanthropic scheme to advance\\". In 1897 Liverpool Corporation entered into an agreement with the Rathbone family to purchase the piece of land, part of which is now Greenbank Park for the sum of ¬£13,000. The agreement required the corporation to maintain this land as open space or recreation ground for the general public, \\"but they shall be at liberty to let off the whole or any part of the said land to cricket or other clubs, and to use the lake for boating, skating or other purposes\\". In case the corporation was to develop the land, they were charged with maintaining a roadway or pathway to allow public access to the lake and to prevent as far as possible the destruction of trees. The park boasts the dual distinction of having the first of the old English gardens in Liverpool's parks, and the first boating lake. The walled garden is all that remains of the Rathbone estate on the park. Now laid out as an old English garden, it contains a memorial tablet to the late Mr. Michael Kearney, the former Deputy Chairman of the Parks and Gardens Committee, who originated the idea of its design. This garden, once famous for its herbaceous borders, has been restored in a move to reflect its former glory. Current usage Greenbank Park has a children's playground, football, pitches, and a fishing pond, as well as mature trees and a conservation area. The pond provides the focal point within the park. Visitors are able to fish and can watch nesting waterfowl and herons. There is a bridge at the northern end of the pond. The wet area towards this end is used as a conservation area and it has been proposed that following improvement works with local schools, this will become an outdoor classroom. Much of the area is open parkland with trees to the perimeter. The wall to the side of the children's playground is a colourful result of a local graffiti art project.

In his tafsir (exegesis) , Ma‚Äôariful-Qur‚Äôan, Muhammad Shafi Deobandi wrote: ‚ÄúIt is recorded in Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi and Nasa‚Äôi that Sayyidna ‚ÄòIrbad Ibn Sariyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to recite Al-Musabbihat before he went to sleep and said: ‚ÄòIn them there is a verse that is more meritorious than a thousand verses‚Äô. ‚ÄúThe collective name of the series Al-Musabbihat refers to the following five Surahs: (1) Al-Hadid; (2) Al-Hashr; (3) As-Saff; (4) Al-Jumu‚Äôah; and (5) At-Taghabun. ‚ÄúHaving cited this Hadith, Ibn Kathir says that the best verse referred to in Surah Al-Hadid is verse (3).

Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan advanced his lines with the objective of bringing Richmond within range of his siege guns. Two Union divisions of the III Corps attacked across the headwaters of White Oak Swamp, but were repulsed by Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger's Confederate division. McClellan, who was in the rear, initially telegraphed to call off the attack, but ordered another attack over the same ground when he arrived at the front. Darkness halted the fighting. Union troops gained only , at a cost of over a thousand casualties on both sides. Background= Military situation  Following the stalemate at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31 and June 1, 1862, McClellan's Army of the Potomac sat passively in their positions around the eastern outskirts of Richmond. The new commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, used the following three and a half weeks to reorganize his army, extend his defensive lines, and plan offensive operations against McClellan's larger army. McClellan received intelligence that Lee was prepared to move and that the arrival of Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's force from the Shenandoah Valley was imminent.Salmon, pp. 96-97. McClellan decided to resume the offensive before Lee could. Anticipating Jackson's reinforcements marching from the north, he increased cavalry patrols on likely avenues of approach. He wanted to advance his siege artillery about a mile and a half closer to the city by taking the high ground on Nine Mile Road around Old Tavern. In preparation for that, he planned an attack on Oak Grove, south of Old Tavern and the Richmond and York River Railroad, which would position his men to attack Old Tavern from two directions. Known locally for a stand of tall oak trees, Oak Grove was the site of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill's assault at Seven Pines on May 31 and had seen numerous clashes between pickets since that time.Sears, p. 183; Salmon, p. 97. The attack was planned to advance to the west, along the axis of the Williamsburg Road, in the direction of Richmond. Between the two armies was a small, dense forest, wide, bisected by the headwaters of White Oak Swamp. Two divisions of the III Corps were selected for the assault, commanded by Brig. Gens. Joseph Hooker and Philip Kearny. Facing them was the division of Confederate Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger.Sears, p. 184. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle Map of Oak Grove Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program At 8:30 a.m., June 25, three Union brigades stepped off in orderly line of battle. From right to left, they were commanded by Brig. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles (the Excelsior Brigade), Brig. Gen. Cuvier Grover, both of Hooker's division, and Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson from Kearny's division. Although Robinson and Grover made good progress on the left and in the center, Sickles's New Yorkers encountered difficulties moving through their abatis, then through the upper portions of the swamp, and finally met stiff Confederate resistance, all of which threw the Federal line out of alignment. Huger took advantage of the confusion by launching a counterattack with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright against Grover's brigade.Sears, pp. 185-86; Salmon, p. 98. Adding to the confusion, one of Wright's Georgia regiments wore red Zouave uniforms. Many of Grover's men believed that only the Union Army had Zouave units, so were reluctant to fire on their own men. When they finally realized that Union troops would not be approaching from the direction of Richmond, they opened fire. At a crucial moment in the battle, the 26th North Carolina of Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom's brigade, in their first combat engagement, delivered a perfectly synchronized volley of rifle fire against Sickles's brigade, breaking up its delayed attack and sending the 71st New York into a panicked retreat, which Sickles described as \\"disgraceful confusion.\\"Sears, pp. 186-87; Salmon, p. 98. Informed of Sickles's reverse, corps commander Heintzelman ordered reinforcements sent forward and also notified army commander McClellan, who was attempting to manage the battle by telegraph from away. McClellan, unaware of most details of the engagement, became alarmed and at 10:30 a.m. ordered his men to withdraw back to their entrenchments, an order that mystified his subordinates on the scene. He telegraphed that he would be arriving at the front in person, which caused a 2.5 hour lull in the action. At 1 p.m., seeing that the situation was not as bad as he had feared, McClellan ordered his men forward to retake the ground for which they had already fought once that day. The fighting lasted until nightfall.Sears, pp. 187-88. Aftermath The minor battle was McClellan's only tactical offensive action against Richmond. His attack gained only at a cost of over 1,000 casualties on both sides and was not strong enough to derail the offensive planned by Robert E. Lee, which already had been set in motion. The next day, Lee seized the initiative by attacking at Beaver Dam Creek north of the Chickahominy River, near Mechanicsville, the first major battle of the Seven Days, and the beginning of a strategic retreat by the Union Army.Salmon, p. 98.

Revealed in Medina, the chapter first addresses the legality of pre-Islamic method of divorce called zihar. The name \\"she who disputes\\" refers to the woman who petitioned Muhammad about the unjustness of this method, and the chapter's first verses outlaws it and prescribes how to deal with past cases of zihar. The chapter also discusses public assemblies and prescribes manners associated with it. The chapter ends by contrasting what it calls \\"the confederates of God\\" and \\"the confederates of Satan\\" and promising rewards for the former.  Revelation history  According to the Islamic tradition, the chapter was revealed during the Medinan period of Muhammad's prophethood, therefore, a Medinan sura. A minority opinion says that only the first ten verses were from the Medinan period, and the rest were from the Meccan period. Another minority opinion says that verse 9 was from the Meccan period, and the rest Medinan. Both traditional and modern scholars of the Quran date the revelation of the chapter to between 4 AH to 7 AH (roughly 625‚Äì628 CE), likely after the Battle of the Trench. The Muslim community was in Medina under the leadership of Muhammad, under threat from the Quraysh tribe in Mecca and from the intrigues of \\"the hypocrites\\" (munafiqun, those who were outwardly Muslim but secretly opposed the Muslims) and the Jewish tribes in Medina. The Constitution of Medina acts as a constitution for this community, and the Quran‚Äîregarded as divine revelations by the Muslims‚Äîprovided the law, and Muhammad acts as the final authority in interpreting the law and adjudicating disputes among the members of the community. The chapter is the first of ten Medinan suras which addresses legal issues in the nascent state led by Muhammad in Medina. The traditional Egyptian chronology puts the chapter as the 105th chapter by the order of revelation (after Al-Munafiqun), while the N√∂ldeke Chronology (by the orientalist Theodor N√∂ldeke) puts it as the 106th.  \\"She who disputes\\"  The first section (verses 1 to 6) was revealed in response to a juridical petition by a Muslim woman named Khaula bint Tha'laba, whom the chapter name refers to. Her husband, a Muslim man named Aws ibn al-Samit, divorced her using the pre-Islamic Arabian custom of zihar. According to the custom, when a husband invoked the declaration \\"You are to me as my mother's back\\", the husband would be free to remarry and released from his obligation towards his wife, while the wife could not remarry. This practice was not isolated and many new converts to Islam used it in Medina. Khaula considered this practice unfair to woman and petitioned Muhammad, as ruler and judge in Medina, to revoke the divorce, using moral and legal arguments. Muhammad initially declined to rule in her favor, citing the existing social custom and the lack of Quranic revelation to the contrary. According to the Islamic tradition, Khaula prayed to God about her predicament, and then God revealed the first six verses of Al-Mujadila to Muhammad, stating that her prayer was heard, overruling Muhammad and effectively outlawing the practice of zihar.  Content  The first six verses addresses the legal status of zihar, as petitioned by Khawla. The verses effectively declare that zihar is an unlawful method of divorce. The verses also address past cases of zihar, allowing them to be reversed by freeing a slave. After the revelation, Muhammad clarified that if freeing a slave was not possible, someone who committed zihar could also perform fasting (sawm) for two months, or feed sixty poor people. The chapter then portrays this direct involvement by God in early Muslim community as a sign of his omnipresence (\\"He is with you wheresoever you are and God sees whatsoever you do\\"). The next section, verses 7 to 13, discusses political debates, which are framed as between \\"the confederates of God\\" and \\"the confederates of Satan\\". They also contain teachings for Muslims about how to conduct public assemblies (al-majalis). While in principle all individuals are free to participate in such assemblies, the verses maintain the importance of contributions from experts (\\"those who are possessed of knowledge\\"). This section also warns against conspiratorial secret meetings that are done for \\"iniquity, hostility and disobedience to the messenger of God\\". The last section, from 14 to 21, is the longest section (ruku') of the chapter. The section defines \\"the confederates of God\\" (hizb Allah) as those \\"who believe in God and the Last Day\\" and \\"the confederates of Satan\\" (hizb al-shaitan) as those who \\"forgets the remembrance of God\\", including those who openly oppose God and Muhammad as well as hypocrites. It closes by discussing the rewards that God will give‚Äîaccording to the Quran‚Äîto his confederates.  Name  The chapter is named Al-Mujadila, \\"she who disputes\\", in reference to Khawla bint Tha'laba whose petition was the occasion of revelation for some of the chapter's verses. It is alternatively called Al-Mujadalah, a related word meaning \\"the dialogue\\", referring to the use of discourse and the dialectical method that is an important theme in the chapter.

Therefore, they affect economic outcomes to date. According to the evidence reported by the initial proponents of such a theory, countries that received civil law would display today less secure investor rights, stricter regulation, and more inefficient governments and courts than those that inherited common law. These differences would reflect both a stronger historical emphasis of common law on private ordering and the higher adaptability of judge-made law. Recent contributions however have criticized the idea that transplanted legal institutions remained intact and have documented that indeed they evolve moved by how each country solves the trade- off between the uncertainty of judge-made law and the bias possibly injected into civil law by inefficient political institutions. Crucially, these latest studies show that considering both the endogeneity between legal traditions and the economy and the evolution of legal systems over time implies that civil law can often economically dominate common law. Colonial Transplantation and Main Structural Differences While English common law originated in thirteenth century England and has then been transplanted through colonization and occupation to England‚Äôs ex-colonies (United States, Canada, Australia, and several countries in Central America, Africa and Asia), the Scandinavian common law was developed in Denmark and Sweden and the German common law sprang in Germany and Switzerland [Guerriero 2016a, p. 54]. These last four countries then exported their common law model to the respective colonies or to those jurisdictions (China, Greece, Japan, Romania, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey), which were never colonized but borrowed their initial legal order from the European codes considered most advanced at the time [Guerriero 2016a, p. 54]. Civil law instead has its roots in Roman law, was incorporated by the Napoleonic codes first and then by both the Austrian and Russian Civil codes, and has been then introduced via mainly colonization and occupation into continental Europe, the Near East, Latin America, Africa, and Indochina. Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Iran, and Kazakhstan instead purposely borrowed their initial legal order from either France, Russia, or England [Guerriero 2016a, p. 54]. Structurally, the two legal traditions constitute a well-defined bundle of lawmaking and adjudication institutions and operate in quite different ways [Merryman 1969, p. 52, 123‚Äì127; Zweigert and K√∂tz 1998, p. 272]. While common law entrusts a key role to the precedents selected by appellate judges and allows more procedural discretion to lower adjudicating courts, civil law relies on legal codes designed by political representatives and bright-line adjudication rules.  Early Empirical Evidence  In a series of influential papers published between 1997 and 2008 (the first one being La Porta et al. (1997) and the last one being La Porta et al. (2008)), Rafael La Porta, Florencio Lopez-de- Silanes, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert Vishny exploited the exogenous assignment of these very different institutions and assumed that they have not been reformed later on to provide evidence consistent with the idea that common law is correlated with > \\"(a) better investor protection, which in turn is associated with improved > financial development [‚Ä¶], (b) lighter government ownership and regulation, > which are in turn associated with less corruption, better functioning labor > markets, and smaller unofficial economies, and (c) less formalized and more > independent judicial systems, which are in turn associated with more secure > property rights and better contract enforcement \\" [La Porta et al. 2008, p. > 298]. Operationally, the \\"legal origins\\" scholars assigned the majority of countries in the world to either the English-common law, the French-civil law, or one among the German, Scandinavian, and Socialist legal traditions and then they calculated correlations between these legal origins dummies and proxies for the aforementioned economic outcomes.  Theoretical Justification to the Putative Primacy of Common Law  Two are the justifications given by the \\"legal origins\\" scholars for the alleged superiority of common law. First, historical events in England and in France built into the common law a stronger emphasis on the independence of the judiciary, private ordering, and human capital. Second, judge-made law would make common law more adaptable to the contracting needs of the economy.  Historical Emphasis of Common Law on Private Ordering  Edward Glaeser and Andrei Shleifer contend that the development of a system of adjudication by lay juries in England and one of adjudication by professional judges in France were conscious choices reflecting the different political power of the English and French barons during the 12th century (Glaeser and Shleifer, 2002). > \\"The former were concerned about the powerful English king‚Äôs ability to > interfere in adjudication and bargained for trial by local, lay juries, a > right enshrined in Magna Carta. The relatively weak French crown, by > contrast, was less a threat than other barons. French barons accordingly > desired a centralized adjudication system controlled by royal judges who > would not be easily captured by local interests\\" [Klerman and Mahoney 2007, > p. 279]. Napoleon‚Äôs attempt to turn through its codes the judiciary into bureaucrats controlled by the State and the post-1688 Glorious Revolution success of the English judiciary in establishing its independence should have reinforced these dissimilarities, instilling at the same time into the common law a stronger emphasis on judicial independence and on private ordering. This divergence would imply that common law will always shore up markets and the civil law will always restrict markets or replace them with state command. This analysis of the medieval European history has been however criticized by Daniel Klerman and Paul Mahoney, who conclude that a system of adjudication by lay juries was initially favored in England because of the low literacy levels and later enforced to place the judicial power in the hands of the crown (Klerman and Mahoney, 2007). Moreover, during the Middle Ages, not only did both French and English judiciaries have the de facto power to make law through precedent, but French judges enjoyed a greater independence being their office a heritable property. Hence, the only permanent divergence between the legal orders in England and in France originated from the different fortunes of the judiciary in the aftermath of their respective revolutions.  Adaptability of Judge-made Law  The key institution differentiating the two legal traditions is the lawmaking institution, which determines the identity of the lawmaker. As aforementioned, common law relies on case law, i.e., the convention that precedents set by appellate courts guide subsequent adjudication by courts of the same or lower standing and can be changed by appellate judges only with a costly justification effort. Civil law instead is grounded on statute law, i.e., which is the act of legislation by political representatives. \\"Legal origins\\" scholars identify three main advantages of judge-made compared with statute law: (1) since overruling is costly, precedents tend to include both the deciding appellate judge‚Äôs opinion and those of the preceding appellate judges in such a way that the long-run law optimally incorporates the different opinions of all appellate judges, whereas statute law can be permanently biased by special interests (Gennaioli and Shleifer, 2007); (2) appellate judges can effectively introduce new information into the law by distinguishing the precedent (Gennaioli and Shleifer, 2007); (3) since inefficient rules tend to be appealed more often, they should be evaluated more often by appellate judges than by politicians (Miceli, 2009).  \\"Endogenous Legal Origins:\\" Theory, Evidence, and Policy Consequences  Recent contributions, however, have criticized the ideas that transplanted legal traditions remained intact and can be measured through legal origins dummies. Inspired by these studies, Carmine Guerriero documents that in a cross-section of 155 transplants, which are countries that received their legal tradition externally, 25 reformed the initial lawmaking institution and 95 reformed at least one among their transplanted lawmaking and adjudication institutions. In particular, in countries that inherited statute law, reforms towards case law have been more likely the largest preference, and in particular both ethnic and genetic, diversity is and reforms towards a pure common law tradition, which is the mix of case law and some discretion in adjudication, are found where the quality of political institutions is the lowest (Guerriero, 2016a). Symmetrically, in countries in which case law was transplanted, reforms towards a pure civil law tradition, which is the mix of statute law and bright-line adjudication rules, are found where the quality of political institutions is the highest (Guerriero, 2016a). This evidence is consistent with the idea that appellate judges' offsetting biases make common law unbiased but volatile and thus more efficient than the certain civil law only when the latter is sufficiently distorted by the lobbying activities of special interests, i.e., when preferences are sufficiently heterogeneous and/or the political process sufficiently inefficient (Guerriero, 2016a). These results cast several doubts on the putative primacy of common law and suggest that comparative law and economics should not only take into account the evolving nature of legal traditions and their endogeneity to preference diversity and the quality of political institutions, but also the nature of the performance of interest. Guerriero (2016b) shows that properly considering these points delivers conclusions very different from those drawn by La Porta et al. (2008). To illustrate, if preference heterogeneity is limited, civil law is more technologically efficient being unbiased as common law but also certain. If preferences are sufficiently diverse instead, the distance between the biased civil law and the technologically efficient legal rule, which is the social optimal rule that will prevail in a perfectly homogenous society, becomes wider the higher preference heterogeneity is and the lower the quality of the political process is. Thus, civil law loses its technological primacy when preferences are sufficiently diverse and/or the political institutions are sufficiently inefficient (Guerriero, 2016b). Consistent with this prediction, a proxy for preference and, in particular, genetic diversity interacted with a measure of the degree to which the transplant legal system in 2000 was nearer to a perfect common law tradition has a positive and significant impact on the stock market development, the extent of private credit, and the employment level.[1] The estimates also imply that reforms towards a pure common law tradition in developing transplants with smaller than average preference heterogeneity will significantly brake stock market development and the extent of private credit, whereas reforms towards a pure common law tradition in developing transplants with larger than average preference heterogeneity will significantly foster stock market development. Finally, the two legal traditions fare equally well when compared with self-reported managers‚Äô beliefs on how much the legal system is able to hit its efficiency targets and their satisfaction with the law.[2] This last patterns squares with the idea that legal traditions have a tendency towards optimality and so should not differ when compared through a proxy for social welfare. > \\"This evidence delivers conclusions quite different from those drawn by the > legal origins project and raises several concerns for the recent waves of > reforms that, inspired by the legal origins literature, have introduced in > developing countries institutions typical of a pure common law legal > tradition (World Bank, 2004). This is particularly worrisome nowadays given > the increasing demand for regulation created by the recent global economic > crisis\\" [Guerriero 2016, p. 16].

The chapter is named al-hashr because the word hashr, meaning 'exile' or 'banishment', appears in verse 2, describing the expulsion of Jewish Banu Nadir tribe from their settlements. The surah features 15 attributes of God in the last three verses. A similitude is given in verse 21. Verse 6 may be related to the controversies of the land of Fadak. Exegesis Surah Al-Hashr opens with Allah proclaiming: Q59:1 Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah. And He is the Almighty, the All- Wise. In Tafsir ibn kathir, Al-Hafiz ibn Kathir explained the significance of the Ayah. He wrote: ‚ÄúEverything glorifies Allah in its own way. Allah states that everything that exists in the heavens and on the earth praises, glorifies, reveres and prays to Him and affirms His Oneness.\\" Further, Allah said in another Ayah: The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification (17:44) Ali, the cousin of Muhammad, narrates about the following verse: Q59:7 Whatever God grants to His Messenger (out of the property) of the people of the towns, belongs to God, the Messenger, the kinsfolk, the orphans, the destitute . . . saying that \\"We are the Ahl al-Bayt (kinsfolk) and this applies to such persons from us exclusively. It is the way Allah has honored His Holy Prophet and has honored us instead of providing us the unlawful things in the hands of people\\". The last four Ayah and commentary by ibn Kathir read: Q59:21 Had We sent down this Qur‚Äôan on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rent asunder by the fear of Allah. Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect. Commenting on Ayah 21, Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir wrote: ‚ÄúAllah the Exalted emphasizes the greatness of the Qur‚Äôan, its high status and of being worthy of making hearts humble and rent asunder upon hearing it, because of the true promises and sure threats that it contains.\\" Q59:22 He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Commenting on Ayah 22, Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir wrote: > ‚ÄúAllah states that He Alone is worthy of worship, there is no Lord or God > for the existence, except Him. All that is being worshiped instead of Allah > are false deities. Allah is the All-Knower in the unseen and the seen, He > knows all that pertains to the creations that we see, and those we cannot > see. Nothing in heaven or on earth ever escapes His knowledge, no matter how > great or insignificant, big or small, including ants in darkness.‚ÄúAllah‚Äôs > statement, ‚ÄòHe is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful‚Äô . . . asserts that > Allah is the Owner of the wide encompassing mercy that entails all of His > creation. He is Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim of this life and of the Hereafter.‚Äù Q59:23 He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, Al-Malik, Al-Quddus, As- Salam, Al-Mu‚Äômin, Al-Muhaymin, Al-Aziz, Al-Jabbar, Al-Mutakabbir. Glory be to Allah! Above all that they associate as partners with Him. Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir then set out the meaning of Allah's Names that are listed in Ayah 23. He wrote that Al Malik means \\"The Owner and King of all things, Who has full power over them without resistance or hindrance\\". He explained that Al-Quddus, means \\"‚ÄòThe Pure‚Äô, according to Wahb bin Munabbih, while Mujahid and Qatadah said that Al-Quddus means ‚ÄòThe Blessed‚Äô. Ibn Jurayj said that Al-Quddus means ‚ÄòHe whom the honorable angels glorify'.\\" As-Salam, means \\"Free from any defects or shortcomings that lessen or decrease His perfect attributes and actions\\" while Al-Mu‚Äômin means one \\"Who has granted safety to His servants by promising that He will never be unjust to them. According to Ad-Dahhak who reported it from Abd Allah ibn Abbas. Qatadah said that Al-Mu‚Äômin means that ‚ÄòAllah affirms that His statements are true‚Äô, while Ibn Zayd said that it means, ‚ÄòHe attested to His faithful servants‚Äô having faith in Him. Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir noted that Al-Muhaymin meant, according to Ibn ‚ÄòAbbas and others, ‚ÄòThe Witness for His servants actions‚Äô, that is the Ever-Watcher over them. Al-Aziz means \\"He is the Almighty, Dominant over all things. Therefore, His majesty is never violated, due to His might, greatness, irresistible power and pride\\". Al- Jabbar, Al-Mutakabbir means \\"The Only One worthy of being the Compeller and Supreme. There is a Hadith in the Sahih Collection in which Allah said: ‚ÄòMight is my Izar and pride is My Rida; if anyone disputes any one of them with Me, then I will punish him.‚Äô‚Äù Q59:24 He is Allah, Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari and Al- Musawwir. To Him belongs the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise. Commenting on Ayah 24 Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir wrote: \\"Al-Khaliq refers to measuring and proportioning, Al-Bari refers to inventing and bringing into existence What he has created and measured. Surely, none except Allah is able to measure, bring forth and create whatever He wills to come to existence. Allah‚Äôs statement, Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir means, if Allah wills something, He merely says to it ‚Äòbe‚Äô and it comes to existence in the form that He wills and the shape He chooses.‚Äù  References  Hashr ","title":"Al-Hashr"},{"id":"1348566","text":"John Cornish White, known as \\"Farmer\\" or \\"Jack\\", (19 February 1891 ‚Äì 2 May 1961) was an English cricketer who played for Somerset and England. White was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1929. He played in 15 Test matches, and captained England in four of them. Domestic career A slow left-arm bowler who used accuracy and variation of pace rather than spin to take wickets, he was a regular player for Somerset from 1913 to 1937, taking 100 wickets a season 14 times. In 1929 and 1930 he also scored more than 1,000 runs, completing the \\"cricketer's double\\". Among his county records, he took 16 Worcestershire wickets for 83 runs in the match at Bath in 1919. He also took all 10 Worcestershire wickets in an innings for 76 runs in 1921 at Worcester. His total number of wickets for Somerset, 2,165, is still the county record, as is his number of catches, 393. His career total of 2,355 wickets puts him 16th on the all-time list of wicket-takers. He was captain of Somerset from 1927 to 1931. His Somerset team-mate R. C. Robertson-Glasgow wrote of White's bowling: \\"besides the length and direction and the variety of flight, he made the ball 'do a little' each way on the truest pitch without any advertisement from his fingers; and he made the ball bounce high even on a wet slow surface, often hitting the splice or near it with the threat of a catch to himself following up, or to silly-point\\".R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, Crusoe on Cricket, Alan Ross, London, 1966, p. 208. Test career White was first picked for England in the difficult 1921 series against the Australians and was not then selected again for seven years. For the tour of Australia in 1928‚Äì29, he was vice-captain to Percy Chapman and the main bowler in a series that turned into a successful war of attrition. At Melbourne, he bowled 113 overs and five balls, and at Adelaide he surpassed that, bowling 124 overs and five balls and taking 13 wickets in the match for 256 runs, as England won by just 12 runs. In the final Test of the series, he stood in as captain for the injured Chapman, but lost the Test and so ended England's then-record-equalling run of seven consecutive Test victories. White captained England again in the series against South Africa in 1929: he won once and drew twice. Further Tests followed against Australia in 1930 and in 1930‚Äì31 in South Africa, again as vice-captain to Chapman. White was a Test selector in 1929 and 1930 and was president of the Somerset club at the time of his death.

She who is Examined (, al-mumta·∏•anah, is the 60th chapter (s≈´rah) of the Quran, a Medinan sura with 13 verses.  Revelation history According to the Islamic tradition, Al-Mumtahanah is a Medinan sura, that is a chapter that is revealed after Muhammad's hijra to Medina. According to The Study Quran, the revelation likely took place at some point after the 6th year after the hijra (AH) or 628 CE. According to some commentators, the first verse was revealed during the conquest of Mecca in 8 AH (January 630 CE). The traditional Egyptian chronology puts the chapter as the 91st chapter by the order of revelation (after Al-Tur), while the N√∂ldeke Chronology (by the orientalist Theodor N√∂ldeke) puts it as the 110th.  Content  The first verse warns Muslims not to make alliance with the enemies of God. Verses 4‚Äî6 provide Abraham as a model for this, as he distanced himself from the pagans of his own tribe, including his own father. Verses 7 to 9 declares a possibility that Muslims and their erstwhile enemy might have better relations (\\"It may be that God will forge affection between you and those of them with whom you are in enmity\\") if the former enemy stops fighting the Muslims. These verses provide basis for the relations of Muslims and non-Muslims according to the Quran: the basic relation is peace unless the Muslims are attacked, or when war is justified to stop injustice or protect the religion. The next following verses (10‚Äì12) address some matters of Islamic law. They declare marriages between Muslims and polytheists are no longer valid, and instruct Muslims on how to resolve the question of mahr when dissolving such marriages. The status of inter-religious marriages was very relevant at the time of the revelation of these verses, a time when multiple women from Mecca converted to Islam while their husbands did not, or vice versa.  Name  Quranic commentators Mahmud al-Alusi (d. 1854) and Abu 'Abdullah Al-Qurtubi (d. 1273) mentioned that this refers to Umm Kulthum bint Uqbah who was the subject of several of its verses. The chapter is also called al-Imtihan (\\"The Examining\\"): according to Al-Qurtubi, this is because the chapter examines the fault of mankind. It is also called al-Mawaddah (\\"The Affection\\"), because the first verse includes the phrase \\"you offer them affection\\", and the seventh includes \\"God will forge affection\\", and because affection of the Muslims is one of the themes in the chapter.

McClellan, which threatened the Confederate capital of Richmond. Lee attempted to turn the Union right flank, north of the Chickahominy River, with troops under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, but Jackson failed to arrive on time. Instead, Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill threw his division, reinforced by one of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill's brigades, into a series of futile assaults against Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps, which occupied defensive works behind Beaver Dam Creek. Confederate attacks were driven back with heavy casualties. Porter withdrew his corps safely to Gaines Mill. Background and Lee's plan= Military situation  Seven Days Battles, June 26‚Äì27, 1862 After the Battle of Seven Pines, on May 31 and June 1, McClellan and the Army of the Potomac sat passively at the outskirts of Richmond for almost a month. Lee, newly appointed commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, devoted this period to reorganizing his army and preparing a counter-attack. He also sent for reinforcements. Stonewall Jackson arrived on June 25 from the Shenandoah Valley following his successful Valley Campaign. He brought four divisions: his own, now commanded by Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder, and those of Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, Brig. Gen. William H. C. Whiting, and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill.Salmon, p. 96; Eicher, pp. 281-82. The Union Army straddled the rain-swollen Chickahominy River. Four of the Army's five corps were arrayed in a semicircular line south of the river. The V Corps under Brig. Gen. Porter was north of the river near Mechanicsville in an L-shaped line running north‚Äìsouth behind Beaver Dam Creek and southeast along the Chickahominy. Lee moved most of his army north of the Chickahominy to attack the Union north flank. He left only two divisions (under Maj. Gens. Benjamin Huger and John B. Magruder) to face the Union main body. This concentrated about 65,000 troops against 30,000, leaving only 25,000 to protect Richmond against the other 60,000 men of the Union army. It was a risky plan that required careful execution, but Lee knew that he could not win in a battle of attrition or siege against the Union army. The Confederate cavalry under Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart had reconnoitered Porter's right flank as part of a daring circumnavigation of the entire Union army from June 12 to June 15 and found it vulnerable. Stuart's forces burned a couple of Union supply ships and was able to report much of McClellan's army's strength and position to Gen. Lee. McClellan was aware of Jackson's arrival and presence at Ashland Station, but did nothing to reinforce Porter's vulnerable corps north of the river.Sears, pp. 172, 195-97; Eicher, pp. 282-83. Lee's plan called for Jackson to begin the attack on Porter's north flank early on June 26. Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill's Light Division was to advance from Meadow Bridge when he heard Jackson's guns, clear the Union pickets from Mechanicsville, and then move to Beaver Dam Creek. The divisions of Maj. Gens. D.H. Hill and James Longstreet were to pass through Mechanicsville, D.H. Hill to support Jackson and Longstreet to support A.P. Hill. Lee expected Jackson's flanking movement to force Porter to abandon his line behind the creek, and so A. P. Hill and Longstreet would not have to attack Union entrenchments. South of the Chickahominy, Magruder and Huger were to demonstrate, deceiving the four Union corps on their front.Eicher, p. 283; Sears, p. 194. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle Union defenses at Ellerson's Mill Lee's intricate plan went awry immediately. Jackson's men, fatigued from their recent campaign and lengthy march, ran at least four hours behind schedule. By 3 p.m., A.P. Hill grew impatient and began his attack without orders. Hill's division, minus Brig. Gen Lawrence O'Brian Branch's brigade, which was placed off to the north to link up with Jackson, entered Mechanicsville and skirmished with George McCall's Union division, deployed around the town. McCall fell back to an easily defensible spot on the opposite side of Beaver Dam Creek. There, the brigades of Brig. Gen John F. Reynolds and Brig. Gen Truman Seymour dug in, with Brig. Gen George G. Meade's brigade placed behind them in reserve, Reynolds' brigade to the north and Seymour's to the south. On Reynolds' right, the divisions of Brig. Gen George Morell and Brig. Gen George Sykes formed a semicircle. Supporting the roughly 26,000 Union infantrymen were 32 artillery pieces.Spelled Ellyson's Mill in There, 14,000 well entrenched infantry, supported by 32 guns in six batteries, repulsed repeated Confederate attacks with substantial casualties.Eicher, p. 284; Salmon, pp. 99-100. Jackson and his command arrived late in the afternoon. However, unable to find A.P. Hill or D.H. Hill, Jackson did nothing. Although a major battle was raging within earshot, he ordered his troops to make camp for the evening. Hill's 11,000 men, most of them green regiments who had never fired a shot in battle, launched a series of futile attacks over the next few hours. The brigade of John R. Anderson assaulted the Union right flank, with James Archer's and Charles W. Field's brigades in support. Maxcy Gregg's brigade was held in reserve and did not participate in the battle at all. Directing his troops, John Reynolds gestured at the oncoming mass of Confederates and told a staffer \\"There they come like flies on a piece of gingerbread.\\" The Union artillery and musketry tore enormous gaps in the Confederate lines as they attempted to cross the creek. Although A.P. Hill had 24 guns with him, he made no attempt to use massed artillery fire to counter the Union gunners, instead sending individual batteries in support of the infantry, most of which were quickly put out of action by enemy shelling.Salmon, p. 101. Some of Anderson's men managed to get across the creek and momentarily threaten Reynolds's position, however he was reinforced by Meade's brigade and two regiments from Morell's division. The three Confederate brigades were driven back with substantial casualties. Arriving on the field and realizing what was happening, Robert E. Lee hastily summoned Longstreet's and D.H. Hill's divisions. As Lee surveyed the futile attacks, Jefferson Davis and the Confederate cabinet rode up to him. Davis asked him \\"General, what is all this army and what is it doing here?\\" Lee replied sarcastically \\"I don't know, Mr. President. It is not my army and this is no place for it.\\" William D. Pender's brigade then attacked the Union left flank at Ellerson's Mill, held by Seymour's brigade. Once again, the well-entrenched infantry and massed artillery proved too much for the Confederates and Pender was forced to retreat. Just then, Roswell Ripley's brigade of D.H. Hill's division arrived on the field and was ordered next to assault the Union left. Ripley charged head-on into the Union entrenchments and suffered the very worst of all with over 600 casualties, the largest percentage of them coming from the 44th Georgia, which lost 335 men and most of its officers (out of a total of 514), including its colonel Robert A. Smith, a roughly 65% casualty rate. The 1st North Carolina suffered 50% casualties (133 men killed, wounded, or captured) and also lost its commander, Col. Montford Stokes. General Ripley himself survived unscathed, but came within inches of being decapitated by an artillery shell. Ripley's other two regiments, the 3rd North Carolina and 48th Georgia, were to the rear of the 1st North Carolina and 44th Georgia; their losses were lighter. Union casualties around Ellerson's Mill were small, only 40 men total were killed or wounded in the 7th Pennsylvania Reserves and 12th Pennsylvania Reserves, which were defending this sector of the battlefield. The 13th Pennsylvania Reserves lost 75 men, the highest total number of any Union outfit. Some 20 years after the battle, D.H. Hill wrote \\"The attacks on the Beaver Dam entrenchments, on the heights of Malvern Hill, at Gettysburg, were all grand, but of exactly the kind of grandeur the South could not afford.\\"\\"Extraordinary Circumstances: The Seven Days Battles\\", Brian K. Burton, 2010 As darkness fell, the rest of D.H. Hill's division came up followed by Longstreet, while on the Union side, George Morrell's division arrived and relieved McCall, whose men were nearly out of ammunition. There was not enough daylight remaining to deploy D.H. Hill and Longstreet's divisions. Jackson did not attack, but his presence near Porter's flank caused McClellan to order Porter to withdraw after dark behind Boatswain's Swamp, five miles (8 km) to the east. McClellan was concerned that the Confederate buildup on his right flank threatened his supply line, the Richmond and York River Railroad north of the Chickahominy, and he decided to shift his base of supply to the James River (he also believed that the demonstrations by Huger and Magruder showed that he was seriously outnumbered). This was a strategic decision of grave import because it meant that, without the railroad to supply his army, he had to abandon his siege of Richmond.Salmon, pp. 100-01; Eicher, pp. 283-84. Aftermath Overall, the battle was a Union tactical victory, in which the Confederates suffered heavy casualties and achieved none of their specific objectives due to the seriously flawed execution of Lee's plan. Instead of over 60,000 men crushing the enemy's flank, only five brigades, about 15,000 men, had seen action. Their losses were 1,484 versus Porter's 361. Lee's staff recalled that he was \\"deeply, bitterly disappointed\\"Sears, p. 208. by Jackson's performance, but communication breakdowns, poorly written orders from Lee, and bad judgment by most of Lee's other subordinates were also to blame.Sears, pp. 208-09; Eicher, pp. 284-85. Despite the Union tactical success, however, it was the start of a strategic debacle and the unraveling of the Peninsula Campaign. McClellan began to withdraw his army to the southeast and never regained the initiative. The next day the Seven Days Battles continued as Lee attacked Porter at the Battle of Gaines's Mill.Sears, p. 209; Salmon, p. 101.

After the intersection, SR 994 turns to the northeast and continues on this trajectory for the next , losing the Southwest 200th Street designation, and passing through a residential neighbourhood and shopping district. As it turns back to the east, SR 994 has an interchange with the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike, passing beneath it, before picking up the Southwest 186th Street designation as it leaves South Miami Heights while crossing another canal. Afterwards, Quail Roost Drive passes through a mixture of commercial and light industrial uses, before crossing the South Miami-Dade Busway, forming the boundary between Cutler Bay and West Perrine's south- eastern corner. One block later, SR 994 terminates at US 1, the South Dixie Highway. From SR 994's western terminus, Southwest 200th Street continues on through farmland in two segments, one from SR 994's terminus to Southwest 187th Street as a two-laned road, and again from just east of Southwest 194th Avenue to Southwest 207th Avenue, just east of the Aerojet canal, as an unmarked rural street and in some places little more than a gravel road. East of the SR 994 terminus, Southwest 186th Street continues on for several blocks into Cutler Bay to terminate at Southwest 97th Street.

It was Chan's second attempt at breaking into the American film market, after 1980 film The Big Brawl, a film which had been a disappointment at the box office. Conflicts between Glickenhaus and Chan during production led to two official versions of the film: Glickenhaus' original version for American audiences and a Hong Kong version re-edited by Jackie Chan. Chan later directed Police Story as a response to this film. Plot Summary=US/Glickenhaus version After a patrol in New York City, New York police officers Billy Wong (Jackie Chan) and his partner Michael (Patrick James Clarke) have a drink at a bar. Machine-gun wielding crooks come in to rob the bar and its customers. Michael kills one of the crooks but is fatally gunned down. Wong shoots the rest but is forced to chase the last remaining crook into the New York harbor, resulting in a boat chase in which he kills the gangster by causing an explosion. Wong is demoted to crowd control for the ruckus. Later, he goes to a fashion show party undercover, hosted by a Laura Shapiro (Saun Ellis), the daughter of a locally known gangster Martin Shapiro. At the party, he meets his new partner, Danny Garoni (Danny Aiello), who has also been demoted due to claims of police brutality. In the middle of the fashion show, masked gangsters armed with machine guns storm in and kidnap Laura Shapiro, and nobody knows why. They later learn that crime boss Harold Ko (Roy Chiao) and Martin Shapiro are suspected of smuggling drugs from Hong Kong to New York, and that Ko may have kidnapped Laura and taken her to Hong Kong for ransom. The men get a lead ‚Äì Shapiro's bodyguard Benny Garrucci (Bill \\"Superfoot\\" Wallace) recently made several calls to a Hong Kong massage parlor. Wong and Garoni go to Hong Kong and investigate the massage parlor. While there, they get massages, but Billy notices that the masseuses are trying to kill them. Billy and Garoni fight off the parlor employees before they are cornered and held at gunpoint by the parlor manager (Shum Wai). The manager questions them, revealing that he knows they are cops, and then threatens to kill them. However, Garoni and Wong overpower him and his men, and leave the parlor. The next day, Wong and Garoni go to see Hing Lee (Peter Yang) on his boat, and they show him the coin of Tin Ho, an Chinatown informant of Wong's and a friend of Lee's. However, Lee is reluctant to give any information about Harold Ko, noting that he retired and is concerned for his safety. A man named Stan Jones (Kim Bass) gets on the boat, and warns Wong and Garoni they are being followed by the massage parlor manager and his men. Garoni, Jones and Wong easily get rid of the other gangsters, then Wong pursues the parlor manager to get more information, and almost catches him but fails. After witnessing this, Hing Lee agrees to help them, telling the cops to come back the next day after he gets information from various contacts about Ko. Wong and Garoni head back to their hotel, finding cash in a suitcase on the bed. Harold Ko then calls them, telling them to take the money and leave Hong Kong at once. During the phone call, they are attacked by Ko's men. Wong and Garoni prevail, but when Wong attempts to interrogate one of them, the gangster sets off a grenade in a suicide attempt to kill them. They are taken to the police station in Hong Kong, where they are scolded by the Royal Hong Kong Police chief superintendent Whitehead (Richard Clarke) for the ruckus. Whitehead refuses to believe that Ko was behind the most recent attack, and tells the cops about Ko's charitable reputation in Hong Kong, informing them that at a press conference Ko will announce that all the winnings from a race horse he owns will be donated to charity. The next day, Garoni and Wong arrive at Ko's press conference (where Benny Garucci is also present) and embarrass Ko by publicly showing the crowd his attempted bribe to them. The next day, Wong, Jones, and Hing Lee's daughter Siu Ling (Moon Lee) visit Mr. Lee to see what he found, while Garoni follows Garrucci. But instead, they see that Hing Lee has been killed and his boat burned. At a loss for information, Wong and Siu Ling visit a fortune teller. The fortune teller cryptically informs them that Garruci has come to Hong Kong to make an exchange for Laura Shapiro. But he warns them that if they interfere, there will only be death and betrayal. Meanwhile, Garoni follows Garruci to a shipyard, and deduces that it's Harold Ko's drug lab with Laura Shapiro inside. In a meeting between Ko and Garucci, it is revealed that Ko kidnapped Shapiro's daughter because Shapiro did not pay for Ko's last shipment, which Garucci said was a \\"simple misunderstanding\\". Wong, Garoni and Jones go to the drug lab. They destroy it and save Laura Shapiro in the process. Garoni, however, fails to escape with them after he is shot by Garrucci, and is held hostage unless Billy returns Laura to Ko. Wong decides to leave Laura Shapiro with Superintendent Whitehead. Wong meets Ko and Garucci at the shipyard. He sees that Garoni is still alive, but then learns that Superintendent Whitehead was on Harold Ko's payroll the whole time, and is now holding Laura Shapiro hostage (confirming the \\"betrayal\\" that the fortune teller warned about). Garucci then engages Wong in a one-on-one hand-to-hand fight, which Wong wins despite Ko's attempts to cheat and help Garucci. Then Wong dispatches Ko's guards and is eventually about to kill Ko, but Garrucci comes after Billy with a cut-off saw. In the ensuing fight, Garrucci is electrocuted when the saw hits an electric panel. Stan Jones and Siu Ling arrive to help untie Garoni and rescue Laura. Ko escapes in a helicopter, and Billy follows after him, but a guard blocks his way. Billy and the guard fight on a cargo lifter, where Wong prevails by eventually knocking the guard off to a long fall to his death. Garoni goes outside with the gang and kills a sniper with a 6-shot 20mm cannon before he can shoot Wong. Wong eventually makes it inside of a crane, and kills Ko when he drops the contents of the crane onto his helicopter. With Ko dead and Laura Shapiro saved, Billy and Danny are given a NYPD Medal of Honor. Hong Kong Version (aka Jackie Chan's personal edit) Although the basic narrative of Jackie Chan's edit is the same as the US version, Chan added a subplot to provide more depth to the movie, which slightly changes how the movie progresses from beginning to end. The plot of this edit begins to deviate from the US version after Garoni and Wong leave the massage parlour. The next day, Wong goes to a theater to look for a woman named May-Fong Ho. However, the woman he is looking for (Sally Yeh) goes by the name Sally, and Wong quickly deduces who she is among the dancers with whom she's rehearsing. Wong disturbs her during the rehearsal by showing her the coin of Tin Ho, whom Sally knows. But she denies having any friends from New York and tries to avoid Wong. Two men competing for Sally's affection try to fight Wong but are easily beaten before Wong pulls out his gun to end the fight and explaining that he's a policeman. Wong and Sally then go to a restaurant, where she reveals that her father and another man were partners of Ko, until Ko killed her father. She changed her name in order to hide from Ko. She tells him to visit a man named Hing Lee, who was her father's partner, and instructs Wong to show Tin Ho's coin to Lee so that he can gain Lee's trust. However, unbeknownst to Sally and Wong, one of Ko's men has overheard the conversation. After this scene, the plot stays the same as the US version until after Ko's press conference. After the press conference, Garucci expresses his concern to Ko's bodyguard, Ho Dai- Wai, about Garoni and Wong's knowledge of their drug operation. David tells him that there's a way he can help. Later that night, Hing Lee meets with his contact Wing (Hoi Sang Lee) at a seafood warehouse to find information about Ko. Wing tells Lee that Laura Shapiro is being held in shipping containers at the shipyard, and reveals that the shipping containers contain Ko's heroin factory. However, they are suddenly attacked by a group of men with ice picks and Benny Garucci. Wing easily beats up the rest of the men, but is overpowered and killed by Garucci in a fight. Later, Wong meets with Hing Lee's daughter Siu Ling to see what information Lee found. They arrive at the warehouse, but find both Lee's and Wing's dead bodies. Realizing that Sally may be in danger, Wong visits Sally at her house. He soon deduces that Sally's substitute maid is working for Ko, and has planted a bomb under Sally's bed. Wong diffuses the bomb. Minutes later, the massage parlor manager arrives to warn Sally that Ko is coming after her. Sally reveals that the manager is actually her uncle and an outcast in her family. The manager had been demoted and fallen out of favor with Ko (also shown in an earlier scene) after failing to kill Hing Lee, Garoni, and Wong earlier, and that they are aware of Wong's visit with Sally. After the uncle arrives, more men working for Ko (this time with guns) arrive to kill them, but they fail and retreat. Sally's uncle tells Wong that Laura is being held at a shipyard in a container, and that inside the containers is Ko's drug factory. Afterwards, Wong instructs Sally and her uncle to find his contact in the United States to build a new life and start over. After this scene, the plot of this edit is the same as the original US version.

Version comparison The relationship between James Glickenhaus and Jackie Chan was, according to various sources, highly contentious for most of the production. Chan was appalled at the way Glickenhaus directed the fight scenes, feeling that his methods were sloppy and lacked attention to detail. At one point he offered to direct the fight scenes himself, but Glickenhaus refused. Things became so bad that Chan walked off the set, but was forced to return and finish the film by contractual obligation. However, when preparing the film for release in Hong Kong, Chan completely re-edited the film and shot new footage to both fit his style of film making and remove all content he found objectionable. The following changes were made by Jackie Chan for the Hong Kong release of the film: Scenes in the US * Punk gang (\\"the Indians\\") robbing the truck driver [trimmed for pacing, use of alternative shots] * Michael & Billy Wong driving from the stripped truck to the bar (heavily trimmed for pacing) * Bar shootout (use of alternate angles, slightly trimmed) * Billy Wong asks a civilian where the black bearded crook who shot Michael has gone. (added) * Wong chasing the black-bearded crook on foot and by boat. (re-edited and trimmed) * Michael's funeral. (deleted) * African- American cop tells Wong \\"Billy, we are with you\\" (in Cantonese) after Wong is scolded by the captain (added) * Garoni's racial slur towards Wong (\\"chink\\") is dubbed in Cantonese to be \\"you boy\\".

In the original US edit, the British HK police chief warns them about their actions and to use discretion, and a native HK police officer tells Bill and Danny about the number they traced to a massage parlor. The HK edit dubs the dialog and shortens the scene so that the chief tells them about the massage parlor. * Billy and Danny receiving a manicure/pedicure at the massage parlour (deleted) * A few short sequences featuring Billy in action in the massage parlour. (deleted in order to make the scene flow better) * Billy catches the gun. (slowed down) =Boat and dock area= * Billy locates Sally Yeh, fights with two guys in a gym and interviews her.

Japanese Extended Version The Japanese version of The Protector can be described as \\"an extended version\\" of Jackie Chan's edit. Like many old school Japanese versions of foreign language films, it features vertical Japanese subtitles burned into the right side of the screen. The Japanese edit and Jackie Chan's edit have these few differences & similarities: * All scenes taking places in the USA contain the original US soundtrack. However the dialog, music, and sound effects were mixed differently to match more closely with the Hong Kong version, as almost all scenes remain edited like they are in the Hong Kong version. * Exclusive to the Japanese version, the scenes of Billy Wong asking a pedestrian where the bearded crook went and the African- American cop expressing his support to Billy were given an English post-sync dub with Jackie Chan's voice, rather than the Cantonese dub for the Hong Kong version. * All scenes taking place in Hong Kong contain the Cantonese dub (although a full Japanese dub was also made). * The opening credits are in English, and feature Sally Yeh's name * The Japanese version exclusively contains the outtake credits Deleted/Extended Scenes Almost all of the Japanese version is edited to match the Hong Kong version, but it contains some scenes that were cut out of the Hong Kong version. Some scenes were given a different Cantonese dub to keep the original context of these scenes intact, as they were in the Glickenhaus version. These scenes are: * Garoni & Wong's first visit with Superintendent Whitehead & the latter conversation with the inspector. The latter conversation was kept in the Japanese version, requiring a new Cantonese dub. * Garoni & Wong talking about their plans outside the police station after their second visit with Whitehead (deleted from the Hong Kong version) * Garucci & David Ho talking in their car after leaving the airport (exclusive to the Japanese version) * Garucci & David Ho talking after Ko's press conference (slightly different Cantonese dub to change context) * Garucci exchanging money with Ko at his office (deleted from Hong Kong version) Reception The movie had a mixed to negative reception when it was released in the United States in 1985. In an interview with James Glickenhaus by Hong Kong film expert Bey Logan held before Chan achieved mainstream success with American audiences, Logan mentioned that many of his fans were disappointed with the movie. An unfazed Glickenhaus responded, \\"Well, you know that's still the most successful Jackie Chan movie internationally and always will be because the American audience, the mainstream audience will never sit still for Jackie's style of action\\". John J Puccio comments that \\"Chan's charm is in precious little evidence and his martial-arts stunts are limited to a few jumps and spills. Without Chan's contributions, the film is nothing more than a clich√©d, wannabe thriller\\". He points out that \\"The Protector\\" isn't just badly written; it's uniformly awful all the way around. The acting is mechanical; the action is gratuitous; the pacing is humdrum; and the background music is trite and redundant. Box office In North America, The Protector was a box office disaster, making only US$981,817. Chan's re-edited version grossed HK $13,917,612 in Hong Kong, a respectable sum, but significantly less than any of Chan's domestic films at the time. Home media *Warner Bros. released the U.S Version on DVD, VHS and Laserdisc. * In Hong Kong, Universe Laser released a DVD of Jackie Chan's personal edit, featuring a Cantonese and Mandarin dub, along with 9 different subtitles, including English. It was non-anamorphic. This DVD is now out of print. *Shout! Factory released The Protector on DVD and Blu-ray as part of a double feature with Crime Story on January 15, 2013. It features the US version in high definition with a lossless DTS 5.1 Master Audio and English Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtracks and English subtitles. The Blu-ray also contains Jackie Chan's edit of the film in anamorphic standard definition. * In 2011, a blu-ray release from Paramount in Japan features the US cut in high definition, the Hong Kong cut in anamorphic standard definition, and a \\"Japanese Extended Edition\\". This is not the original Japanese extended edition, as the scenes from the Hong Kong edit are visibly inferior to the scenes from the US version. The extended cut is presented in anamorphic standard definition, and combines scenes from the US cut and the Hong Kong cut. The Glickenhaus scenes contain the original English dialog and the Hong Kong version scenes contain the Cantonese dub. However, this version does have the exclusive outtake credits, which plays the song \\"One Up for the Good Guys\\" by Chip Taylor. *In 2014, another Japanese blu-ray from Paramount was released, this time containing the true Japanese extended cut (with the vertical Japanese subtitles) in high-definition. It features the original English/Cantonese soundtrack and a Japanese dub, each encoded in LPCM 2.0, but with no English subtitles. *In 2015, a German blu-ray released by Splendid contained the Glickenhaus version in high definition with the original unaltered mono track in 2.0 DTS-MA, along with Fortune Star's slightly altered audio track. It also features an HD-upscaled version of the Hong Kong edit with a DTS-MA encoded audio, and a non-upscaled anamorphic version with a 2.0 Dolby track. *In 2019, a UK blu-ray released by 88 Films containing the Gickenaus version in high definition, and it is the first time that it is been given a true high- definition remaster. The blu-ray by 88 Films also contains the Hong Kong edit as a 1080p upscale from an SD source. The Glickenhaus edit contains the original stereo track and the slightly altered track from Fortune Star, while the Hong Kong edit contains a 2.0 Dolby track. Commentary tracks are provided to both edits along with many special features.

AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l (occasions or circumstances of revelation) is a secondary genre of Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir) directed at establishing the context in which specific verses of the Qur'an were revealed. Though of some use in reconstructing the Qur'an's historicity, asbƒÅb is by nature an exegetical rather than a historiographical genre, and as such usually associates the verses it explicates with general situations rather than specific events. A hadith recorded by Muhammad al- Bukhari which narrates the occasion of revelation of this surah is as follows. * Narrated Zayd ibn Arqam: While I was with my uncle, I heard Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy saying, \\"Do not spend on those who are with Allah's Messenger (Ô∑∫), that they may disperse and go away (from him). And if we return to Medina, surely, the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner. \\"I mentioned that to my uncle who, in turn, mentioned it to the Prophet. The Prophet (Ô∑∫) called me and I told him about that. Then he sent for Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy and his companions, and they swore that they did not say so. The Prophet (Ô∑∫) disbelieved my statement and believed theirs. I was distressed as I have never been before, and I remained in my house. My uncle said to me, \\"You just wanted the Prophet (Ô∑∫) to consider you a liar and hate you.\\" Then Allah revealed:-- 'When the hypocrites come to you, they say: 'We bear witness that you are indeed the Apostle of Allah.\\" (63.1) So the Prophet (Ô∑∫) sent for me and recited it and said, \\"Allah has confirmed your statement.\\" Sahih Bukhari USC- MSA web (English) reference : Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith 427 Arabic reference : Book 65, Hadith 4904 Content of the surah The Surah deals with the phenomenon of hypocrisy. It criticizes hypocrisy and condemns the hypocrites. It also exhorts the Believers to be sincere in their faith and make charity. According to Javed Ahmad Ghamidi a Pakistani Muslim theologian, Quran scholar, exegete and educationist; The theme of Surah al-Munafiqun is to inform the Muslims that the Hypocrites are absolute liars. They must not be influenced by their talk and their style of swearing oaths on every statement because they want to stop the Muslims from spending in the way of God and, in this manner, take them away from God and His Prophet (sws). Amin Ahsan Islahi elaborates that: :This surah is a supplement to Surah Jum\`ah, the previous surah. It can be divided into two sections. The first one consists of eight verses, while the last three verses constitute the second section. In the first section, the character of the hypocrites is evaluated and shown that their real ailment is their lust for worldly riches. In the second section, Muslims are warned that the love of wealth and children should not make them indifferent to the remembrance of the Almighty. If today they do not truly benefit from their wealth by not spending in the way of Allah, they will feel sorry, once their life ends and at that moment their regret will be of no use to them. In other words, in the first section the illness of hypocrisy is elaborated upon, while in the second section, Muslims are asked to guard themselves against it.

It is styled an Overture-Fantasy, and is based on Shakespeare's play of the same name. Like other composers such as Berlioz and Prokofiev, Tchaikovsky was deeply inspired by Shakespeare and wrote works based on The Tempest and Hamlet as well. Unlike Tchaikovsky's other major compositions, Romeo and Juliet does not have an opus number.Tchaikovsky Research: Romeo and Juliet It has been given the alternative catalogue designations TH 42Alexander Poznansky & Brett Langston, The Tchaikovsky Handbook, Vol. 1 (2002) Tchaikovsky Research: Catalogue Numbers and ƒåW 39.Polina Vaidman, Liudmila Korabel'nikova, Valentina Rubtsova, Thematic and Bibliographical Catalogue of P. I. ƒåajkovskij's Works (2006), and P. I. ƒåajkovskij. New Edition of the Complete Works (1993‚Äìdate) Musical structure Although styled an 'Overture- Fantasy' by the composer, the overall design is a symphonic poem in sonata form with an introduction and an epilogue. The work is based on three main strands of the Shakespeare story. The first strand, written in F-sharp minor, following Mily Balakirev's suggestion, is the introduction representing the saintly Friar Laurence. Here there is a foreboding of doom from the lower strings. The Friar Laurence theme is heard in F minor, with plucked strings, before ending up in E minor. The introduction is chorale-like. An 1870 oil painting by Ford Madox Brown depicting Romeo and Juliet's famous balcony scene Eventually a single first inversion B minor chord is passed back and forth between strings and woodwinds grows into the second strand in B minor, the agitated theme of the warring Capulets and Montagues, including a reference to the sword fight, depicted by crashing cymbals. There are agitated, quick sixteenth notes. The forceful irregular rhythms of the street music point ahead to Igor Stravinsky and beyond. The action suddenly slows, the key changing from B minor to D-flat (as suggested by Balakirev) and we hear the opening bars of the \\"love theme\\", the third strand, passionate and yearning in character but always with an underlying current of anxiety. The love theme signifies the couple first meeting and the scene at Juliet's balcony. The English horn and viola represent Romeo, while the flutes represent Juliet. Then the battling strand returns, this time with more intensity and build-up, with the Friar Laurence Theme heard with agitation. The strings enter with a lush, hovering melody over which the flute and oboe eventually soar with the love theme once again, this time loud and in D major, signaling the development section and their consummated marriage, and finally heard in E major, and two large orchestra hits with cymbal crashes signal the suicide of the two lovers. A final battle theme is played, then a soft, slow dirge in B major ensues, with timpani playing a repeated triplet pattern, and tuba holding a B natural for 16 bars. The woodwinds play a sweet homage to the lovers, and a final allusion to the love theme brings in the climax, beginning with a huge crescendo B natural roll of the timpani, and the orchestra plays homophonic shouts of a B major chord before the final bar, with full orchestra belting out a powerful B natural to close the overture. Composition Tchaikovsky at the time he wrote Romeo and Juliet Tense relationship In 1869 Tchaikovsky was a 28-year-old professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Having written his first symphony and an opera, he next composed a symphonic poem entitled Fatum. Initially pleased with the piece when Nikolai Rubinstein conducted it in Moscow, Tchaikovsky dedicated it to Balakirev and sent it to him to conduct in St. Petersburg. Fatum received only a lukewarm reception. Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky explaining the defects, but also giving some encouragement: > Your Fatum has been performed [in St. Petersburg] reasonably well ... There > wasn't much applause, probably because of the appalling cacophony at the end > of the piece, which I don't like at all. It is not properly gestated, and > seems to have been written in a very slapdash manner. The seams show, as > does all your clumsy stitching. Above all, the form itself just does not > work. The whole thing is completely uncoordinated.... I am writing to you > with complete frankness, being fully convinced that you won't go back on > your intention of dedicating Fatum to me. Your dedication is precious to me > as a sign of your sympathy towards me‚Äîand I feel a great weakness for you. > M. Balakirev‚Äîwho sincerely loves you.From Balakirev, 30 March 1869 Tchaikovsky was too self-critical not to see the truth behind Balakirev's comments. He accepted Balakirev's criticism, and the two continued to correspond. (Tchaikovsky later destroyed the score of Fatum. The score was reconstructed posthumously from the orchestral parts.)Brown, Man and Music, 46. Balakirev remained suspicious of anyone with a formal conservatory training but clearly recognized Tchaikovsky's great talents.Brown, New Grove Russian Masters, 157‚Äì158. Tchaikovsky liked and admired Balakirev. However, as he told his brother Anatoly, \\"I never feel quite at home with him. I particularly don't like the narrowness of his musical views and the sharpness of his tone.\\" Balakirev suggested Tchaikovsky write a piece based on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Tchaikovsky was having difficulties writing an opera entitled Undine, which he would eventually destroy. Though he complained, \\"I'm completely burned out,\\" Balakirev persisted, as was his manner. Balakirev wrote suggestions about the structure of Romeo and Juliet, giving details of the type of music required in each section, and even opinions on which keys to use.Holden, 74. Balakirev had suggested his own overture King Lear as a model for Romeo‚Äîa prudent move, since he had seen Tchaikovsky's weakness in writing in an unstructured musical form in Fatum. King Lear is not a symphonic poem in the manner of Liszt. It is a tragic overture in sonata form along the line of Beethoven's overtures, relying more on the dramatic potential of sonata form rather than on a literary program. Thus, Balakirev had transformed King Lear into an instrumental drama and now offered it as a model to Tchaikovsky.Maes, 64. While basing Romeo and Juliet on King Lear was Balakirev's suggestion, reducing the plot of the former to one central conflict and then combining it with the binary structure of sonata form was Tchaikovsky's idea. However, executing that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions.Maes, 73‚Äì74. Mily Balakirev around the time Tchaikovsky met him. First version The first version of Romeo and Juliet contained basically an opening fugato and a confrontation of the two themes‚Äîexactly what an academically trained composer might be expected to produce. While Balakirev responded to the love theme by writing Tchaikovsky, \\"I play it often, and I want very much to hug you for it\\",Quoted in Brown, David, Tchaikovsky: The Early Years, 1840‚Äì1874, 180‚Äì181, 183‚Äì184. he also discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him‚Äîthe opening, for instance, sounded more like a Haydn quartet than the Liszt chorale he had suggested initially‚Äîand the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and St. Petersburg, going to Tchaikovsky or Balakirev.Maes, 74. Tchaikovsky accepted some, but not all, of Balakirev's nagging, and completed the work, dedicating it to Balakirev. The first performance on March 16, 1870 was hindered by a sensational court case surrounding the conductor, Tchaikovsky's friend Nikolai Rubinstein, and a female student. The court had found against the eminent musician the previous day, and this incited a noisy demonstration in his favour when he appeared on the concert platform, which proved much more interesting to the audience than the new overture. The result was not encouraging as a premiere for Romeo and Juliet.Weinstock, 69. Tchaikovsky said of the premiere: : \\"After the concert we dined.... No one said a single word to me about the overture the whole evening. And yet I yearned so for appreciation and kindness.\\"Kamien 254. Second version The initial failure of Romeo and Juliet induced Tchaikovsky to fully accept Balakirev's criticisms and rework the piece. It also forced Tchaikovsky to reach beyond his musical training and rewrite much of the music into the form we know today. This included the unacademic but dramatically brilliant choice of leaving the love theme out of the development section, saving its confrontation with the first theme (the conflict of the Capulets and Montagues) for the second half of the recapitulation. In the exposition, the love theme remains shielded from the violence of the first theme. In the recapitulation the first theme strongly influences the love theme and ultimately destroys it. By following this pattern, Tchaikovsky shifts the true musical conflict from the development section to the recapitulation, where it climaxes in dramatic catastrophe. Meanwhile, Rubinstein had become impressed with Tchaikovsky's compositional talents in general and with Romeo and Juliet in particular. He arranged for the publishing house Bote and Bock to publish the piece in 1870. This was considered an accomplishment since Tchaikovsky's music was virtually unknown in Germany at the time. Balakirev thought Tchaikovsky was rushing Romeo and Juliet to press prematurely. \\"It is a pity that you, or rather Rubinstein, should have rushed the publication of the Overture,\\" he wrote to the composer. \\"Although the new introduction is a decided improvement, there were other changes I had wanted you to make. I had hoped that for the sake of your future compositions, this one would remain in your hands somewhat longer.\\" Balakirev closed by hoping that P. Jurgenson would sometime agree to bring out a \\"revised and improved version of the Overture.\\"Weinstock, 70. The second version was premiered in St. Petersburg on February 17, 1872, under Eduard N√°pravn√≠k. Third and final version In 1880, ten years after his first reworking of the piece, Tchaikovsky rewrote the ending and gave the piece the sub-title \\"Overture-Fantasia\\". It was completed by September 10, 1880, but did not receive its premiere until May 1, 1886, in Tbilisi, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire), under Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov. This third and final version is the one that is now in the repertoire. The earlier versions are performed occasionally as historical curiosities. The third version is scored for an orchestra comprising piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets (in A), 2 bassoons + 4 horns (in F), 2 trumpets (in E), 3 trombones, tuba + timpani, cymbals, bass drum + harp, violins I, violins II, violas, cellos, and double basses. Reception At first Romeo and Juliet was not successful in Russia and Europe. It was received lukewarmly at its world premiere in March 1870.Brown, Early, 209. The work was hissed when Hans Richter conducted it in Vienna in November 1876; critic Eduard Hanslick excoriated the piece afterwards.Brown, Crisis, 103. The Paris premiere two weeks later, at the Concerts Populaires under Jules Pasdeloup, went no better. According to Tchaikovsky's colleague and friend Sergei Taneyev, who attended the Paris performance, Romeo's lack of success there may have been due to Pasdeloup's failure to understand the music. Despite this, several Parisian composers and musicians, including Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, appreciated the piece. One group that appreciated Romeo at once was the kuchka (\\"The Five\\"). Balakirev, now having the full score, wrote of their enthusiastic response and 'how delighted everyone is with your D-flat bit [the love theme]‚Äîincluding Vladimir Stasov, who says: \\"There were five of you: now there are six!\\" The beginning and end are as strongly censured'‚Äîand, Balakirev added, needed rewriting. Still, such was the enthusiasm of the kuchka for Romeo that Balakirev was asked to play it every time they met. Eventually, he learned to play the piece from memory as a result of fulfilling their requests.Brown, Tchaikovsky: Man and Music, 49. In popular culture The Overture's love theme has been influentially used in many television series and movies such as Columbo, The Jazz Singer (1927), Wayne's World, Animaniacs, Taz-Mania, Tiny Toon Adventures, Scrubs, Seeing Double, The Simpsons, South Park, Clueless, A Christmas Story, The Fresh Prince of Bel- Air, Moonraker, SpongeBob SquarePants, Pushing Daisies, Sesame Street, El Chavo, The Three Musketeers, The Ren & Stimpy Show, among others. Different variations of the overture's love theme were also played in the original The Sims video game, when two Sims successfully performed the \\"Kiss\\" interaction. How \\"powerful\\" the theme was depended on how compatible, or how in love, the interacting Sims were with each other. Along with another Tchaikovsky piece, Dance of the Reed Flutes from the ballet The Nutcracker, the Romeo and Juliet love theme was sampled at the same time to the song \\"Love, so Lovely\\" for the direct-to-video Disney film Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers. Excerpts from the score were used in the 2005 ballet Anna Karenina, choreographed by Boris Eifman. The main theme of the overture to Romeo and Juliet was adapted in 1939 by bandleader Larry Clinton as popular song \\"Our Love\\" (lyrics by Buddy Bernier and Bob Emmerich) and recorded by Clinton and by Jimmy Dorsey.William H.

Skiathos is the westernmost island in the Northern Sporades group, east of the Pelion peninsula in Magnesia on the mainland, and west of the island of Skopelos. Geography Satellite photo of Skiathos The island has a north to southwestern axis and is about long and wide on average. The coastline is indented with inlets, capes and peninsulas. The southeast and southwest parts have gentler slopes and that is where most settlements and facilities are located. The terrain is more rugged on the north coast, with the highest peak at on mount Karafiltzanaka (). The main town is Skiathos (pop. 4,883 in 2011), in the eastern part of the island. Other main settlements are Kalyvia (312), Troullos (158), Œßanemos (143), Koukounaries (119), and Achladias (118). The Municipality of Skiathos includes the islets of Tsougria, Tsougriaki, Maragos, Arkos, Troulonisi and Aspronisi. The municipality has an area of 49.898 km2. They are scattered a few kilometres off the southeast coastline and are clearly visible from the town and the beaches. The island of Skopelos is visible from Skiathos with the more distant islands of Euboea and Skyros visible under very clear weather conditions. Skiathos town The main paved road runs along the southeastern stretch of the island with several narrow dirt roads branching off towards the interior and the northern coast. Farmland exists around the major settlements on the island. Despite its small size, Skiathos with its many beaches and wooded landscape is a popular tourist destination. It has over 60, mostly sandy, beaches scattered around the coastline. Some of these are Troulos, Vromolimnos, Koukounaries, Asselinos, Megali Ammos and Mandraki.Tourist information and Skiathos island guide, Thesaurus.gr Much of the island is wooded with Aleppo Pine and a small Stone Pine forest at the Koukounaries location where there is a lagoon and a popular beach. The island's forests are concentrated on the southwest and northern parts, but the presence of pine trees is prevalent throughout the island. History In Ancient times, the island played a minor role during the Persian Wars. In 480 BC, the fleet of the Persian King Xerxes was hit by a storm and was badly damaged on the rocks of the Skiathos coast. Following this the Greek fleet blockaded the adjacent seas to prevent the Persians from invading the mainland and supplying provisions to the army facing the 300 Spartans defending the pass at Thermopylae. The Persian fleet was defeated there at Artemisium and finally destroyed at the Battle of Salamis a year later. Skiathos then became part of the Delian League. The city was destroyed by Philip V of Macedon in 200 BC. In 1207 the Ghisi brothers captured the island and built the Bourtzi, a small Venetian-styled fortress similar to the Bourtzi in Nafplio, on an islet just out of Skiathos Town, to protect the capital from the pirates. But the Bourtzi was ineffective in protecting the population and in the mid-14th century the inhabitants moved the capital from the ancient site that lay where modern Skiathos Town is to Kastro (the Greek word for castle), located on a high rock, overlooking a steep cliff above the sea at the northernmost part of the island. The island returned to Byzantine control in the 1270s, and remained in Byzantine hands until after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, when it passed to the Republic of Venice. Like the rest of the Northern Sporades, Skiathos was conquered by the Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa in 1538. In 1704 monks from Athos built the Evangelistria Monastery, which played a part on the Greek War of Independence as a hide-out for Greek rebels. The first flag of Greece was created and hoisted in the Evangelistria Monastery in Skiathos in 1807, where several prominent military leaders (including Theodoros Kolokotronis and Andreas Miaoulis) had gathered for consultation concerning an uprising, and they were sworn to this flag by the local bishop. After the War of Independence and demise of piracy in the Aegean, Kastro became less important. In 1830s, the island's capital was moved to the original site ‚Äî where it still remains. Today, the ruins of Kastro are a tourist attraction. During the 19th century Skiathos became an important shipbuilding centre in the Aegean due to the abundance of pine forests on the island. The pine woods of the island were then almost obliterated. This was brought to a halt though, due to the emergence of steamboats. A small shipwright remains north of Skiathos Town, which still builds traditional Greek caiques.

The boats are operated mainly by Hellenic Seaways using its high-speed Flying Cat vessels as well as conventional ferries. Skiathos International Airport is at the northeast of the island next to a lagoon and a lowland isthmus separating the island from the peninsula of Lazareta. As of summer 2011, Skiathos airport is served by Olympic Air flights from both Athens and Thessaloniki, while foreign airlines provide charter flights from a range of airports in European countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Cyprus and Scandinavian countries. During the winter 2013/14, work began to expand the airport, with a runway extension and increased hard standing for parked aircraft. The modern major road runs along the eastern and southern coast. Narrower roads, some paved and some dirt, reach the interior and the northwest coastline. There is regular, and during tourist season, very frequent bus transit from the main town to the Koukounaries beach in the southwest. There are three bus routes on the island. The core route is from the main town to Koukounaries beach which travels along the south coast of the island. There are in total 26 bus stops, with Koukounaries Beach being the last stop, number 26. This route operates a fleet of five coaches as frequently as five times an hour during the summer peak season throughout the day, but is significantly reduced during the winter. The second route departs from Skiathos Town, to the Monastery of Evangelistria at an hourly daily schedule and the third bus route to Xanemos on the north coast with up to six round trips daily, both operated using mini-buses.

His overall record was 50 wins (43 by KO), 16 losses and two draws. Professional career Fernandez was born in Santiago de Cuba. he was a big left hook artist who racked up a series of victories which led to his title challenge against Gene Fullmer. The 25-year- old Fernandez lost a split decision to Fullmer for the middleweight title in Ogden, Utah on August 5, 1961. Referee Ken Shulsen scored the fight 145-142 Fullmer, judge Del Markham favored Fernandez 145-143, and judge Norman Jorgensen scored it 148-140. Fernandez insisted on a rematch, but Ring Magazine writer Al Buck pointed to Fernandez's two fights with Rocky Kalingo as a reason why Fullmer would be foolish to fight Fernandez in Communist Cuba; \\" Fighting Fernandez in Cuba hardly would be an enjoyable experience except for another Cuban, a Russian, or a Red Chinese. A Fernandez-Yankee battle in Havana would be put in a military atmosphere and amid turmoil. It was recalled that one Rocky Kalingo knocked out Fernandez in one round in Caracas and then let the Cuban have a return fight in Havana. Kalingo knocked Fernandez down in the first and appeared to be headed for another victory. The mob wouldn't have it. Kalingo was threatened to the point at which he was scared into near- paralysis. He was stopped.\\" Fernandez never received his rematch, but did receive 20 percent of the $100,000.00 gate and $10,000.00 from the paid-t.v. money. When Cuba outlawed professional boxing, Fernandez lived in exile from the communist government of Cuba, in Miami Beach, Florida, where he became a fan favorite on television, and on the fight cards promoted by Chris Dundee. In most cases Fernandez either knocked out his opponents, or was in turn KO'd himself. Loss to Carter Fernandez might be best remembered for his one- round knockout loss to Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, lasting only a few seconds in 1962. Fernandez came back the following year to knock out undefeated, future world light-heavyweight champion Jos√© Torres in five rounds on May 26, 1963. First Retirement and Comeback After a knockout defeat to club-fighter Willie Tiger in 1967, Fernandez announced his retirement. He blamed his numerous knockout defeats on personal problems associated with the political situation in his native country of Cuba. He was working as a dishwasher and busboy when he decided to launch a comeback as a light heavyweight. Fernandez shocked the boxing world by scoring upset knockouts over Florida Middleweight Champion Jimmy Williams and highly regarded Jerry Evans. However, just when it seemed that Fernandez was on the verge of a title shot against light heavyweight king Bob Foster, Fernandez was stopped in the 10th round of a toe- to-toe slugfest with upstart Vernon McIntosh in 1972. Retirement In the early 1980s, Fernandez briefly coached amateur boxers at the Elizabeth Virrick Gym in Coconut Grove, Florida Honors In 2003, Fernandez made the Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

Following the inconclusive Battle of Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville) the previous day, Confederate General Robert E. Lee renewed his attacks against the right flank of the Union Army, relatively isolated on the northern side of the Chickahominy River. There, Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps had established a strong defensive line behind Boatswain's Swamp. Lee's force was destined to launch the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions. Porter's reinforced V Corps held fast for the afternoon as the Confederates attacked in a disjointed manner, first with the division of Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill, then Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, suffering heavy casualties. The arrival of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's command was delayed, preventing the full concentration of Confederate force before Porter received some reinforcements from the VI Corps. At dusk, the Confederates finally mounted a coordinated assault that broke Porter's line and drove his men back toward the Chickahominy River. The Federals retreated across the river during the night. The Confederates were too disorganized to pursue the main Union force. Gaines' Mill saved Richmond for the Confederacy in 1862; the tactical defeat there convinced Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan to abandon his advance on Richmond and begin a retreat to the James River. The battle occurred in almost the same location as the Battle of Cold Harbor nearly two years later. Background= Military situation  McClellan's Army of the Potomac had pushed to within a few miles of the Confederate capital of Richmond and had stalled following the Battle of Seven Pines in late May 1862. Lee wanted to take the initiative, believing that remaining on the strategic defensive would play into Union hands and allow the Confederacy to be worn down. He planned to shift his 90,000-man Confederate army to the north of Richmond, and attack McClellan's right flank. The Confederate cavalry under the command of Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart had ridden around McClellan's army, confirming that the flank was open--not anchored on Totopotomoy Creek--and vulnerable. Lee planned to use Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's force, transported by rail from the Shenandoah Valley, to attack on McClellan's right and rear, while the remainder of his army under Maj. Gens. A.P. Hill, James Longstreet, and D.H. Hill attacked from the direction of Mechanicsville.Salmon, pp. 64, 96-97. thumbupright=1.5Seven Days Battles, June 26-27, 1862 The Seven Days Battles began with a Union attack in the minor Battle of Oak Grove on June 25, but the first major battle started the next day when Lee launched a large-scale assault against McClellan at the Battle of Beaver Dam Creek (or Mechanicsville). Lee attacked Porter's V Corps north of the Chickahominy, while the bulk of the Union Army was relatively unoccupied south of the river. Although this battle was a tactical victory for the Union, McClellan realized that he could not keep Porter's corps in place with Jackson threatening his flank. He ordered Porter to begin a withdrawal and at the same time decided to change the army's base of supply from White House on the Pamunkey River to Harrison's Landing on the James River. (This decision was fatal to McClellan's campaign because by abandoning the railroad that led from the Pamunkey, he would no longer be able to supply his planned siege of Richmond with the necessary heavy artillery.)Kennedy, pp. 93-94; Burton, pp. 79-81; Sears, pp. 183-208; Salmon, pp. 99-101. Several of McClellan's subordinates urged him to attack the Confederate division of Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder south of the Chickahominy, but he feared the vast numbers of Confederates he believed to be before him and failed to capitalize on the overwhelming superiority he actually held on that front. Magruder assisted in this misapprehension by ordering frequent, noisy movements of small units back and forth and by using groups of slaves with drums to simulate large marching columns. Furthermore, the Union Army Balloon Corps, which had performed the only aerial observation during the Peninsula Campaign, was now joined by a Confederate competitor. Capt. Langdon Cheves of South Carolina had constructed a multicolored balloon of dress silk obtained from Charleston and Savannah, which sailed aloft tethered to a boxcar on the York River Railroad, manned by Maj. Edward Porter Alexander. The appearance of this balloon reinforced McClellan's fear that the Confederates were planning for an offensive against his left flank. For the second day, the Confederates were able to continue fooling McClellan south of the river by employing minor diversionary attacks to command the attention of 60,000 Federal troops while the heavier action occurred north of the river.Eicher, p. 287; Sears, pp. 215-16\\\\. Sears notes that stories about the silk coming from donated ladies' dresses is apocryphal. The order to Porter's corps came just before dawn and they did not have adequate time to prepare a strong rear guard for the withdrawal, resulting in numerous men from Brig. Gen. George A. McCall's division being captured by the advancing Confederates. Porter selected a new defensive line on a plateau behind Boatswain's Swamp, just to the southeast of a mill owned by Dr. William F. Gaines. It was a strong position, with two divisions laid out in a semicircle--Brig. Gen. George W. Morell on the left and Brig. Gen. George Sykes on the right--and two divisions in reserve--Brig. Gen. George A. McCall and Brig. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, the latter on loan to Porter from Brig. Gen. William B. Franklin's VI Corps. Slocum's division had not crossed the river by the start of the battle, held up by McClellan's concern about an impending attack on Franklin's front.Salmon, pp. 102-103; Sears, pp. 214-15. Lee's offensive plan for June 27 was similar to that of the preceding day. He would use A.P. Hill's and Longstreet's divisions to pressure Porter's corps as it withdrew, while Stonewall Jackson, augmented by D.H. Hill (Jackson's brother- in-law), hit Porter's right and rear. The combined effort of all of Lee's force was destined to be the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions. Lee traveled to Walnut Grove Church to meet with Jackson and describe the plan, which called for Jackson to march toward Old Cold Harbor, and then south beyond Porter's flank. Unfortunately, Lee made incorrect assumptions about Porter's disposition. He assumed that the V Corps would defend the line of Powhite Creek, somewhat to the west of Porter's actual location.Time-Life, p. 45; Sears, pp. 217-19. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle \\"Battle of Gaines Mill, Valley of the Chickahominy, Virginia, June 27, 1862.\\" Records of the Office of the Chief Signal Officer, 1860 - 1985. The first actions of the battle occurred between noon and 1 p.m. on June 27 after D.H. Hill's division reached Old Cold Harbor, where it was scheduled to link up with Stonewall Jackson's command. Hill pushed through the crossroads with two brigades, which encountered unexpected infantry fire. Seeking to suppress the fire, he brought forward the Jeff Davis Battery from Alabama, but it was soon outgunned by two six-gun batteries manned by U.S. regulars from Brig. Gen. George Sykes's division. Hill was surprised at the level of resistance and also that he seemed to be meeting the front of the Union force, not the expected flank, so he determined to wait for Jackson's arrival before moving further. The noise from this engagement failed to reach General Lee at his headquarters, the house owned by William Hogan, named \\"Selwyn\\".Sears, pp. 219-21; Burton, p. 103. Salmon, p. 102, states that the artillery engagement occurred at 2 p.m. Welcher, p. 819, states 11 a.m. A.P. Hill's attack A.P. Hill's division had moved across Beaver Dam Creek early in the morning, finding the former Union line lightly defended. As they proceeded eastward and approached Gaines' Mill at about the time that D.H. Hill's men were engaged, Porter formally asked McClellan to send Slocum's division across the Chickahominy over Alexander's Bridge to support him. Hill directed the brigades of Maxcy Gregg and Lawrence O'Bryan Branch to spearhead the assault, as they had not been engaged at Beaver Dam Creek and were well- rested. Gregg was held up by skirmishers from Col. Hiram Berdan's 1st U.S. Sharpshooters and the 9th Massachusetts Infantry. By early afternoon, he had run into strong opposition by Porter, deployed along Boatswain's Creek, and the swampy terrain was a major obstacle against the advance. A particularly bloody engagement occurred as the 1st South Carolina Rifles attacked a Massachusetts battery, but were repulsed by Zouaves of the 5th New York, which inflicted 57% casualties (76 killed, 221 wounded, and 58 missing) on the South Carolinians, the greatest Confederate regimental losses of the day. Branch's brigade fared no better, losing 401 men in two hours of fighting. Following behind them, Joseph R. Anderson's brigade launched three assaults on the Union lines without putting a dent in them. Field's brigade became bogged down in the swamp, and some of the men in the rear ended up firing into their comrades. Some of Gregg's men reached the other side of the creek; none of the rest came close.Burton, pp. 91-99; Sears, pp. 223-26; Kennedy, p. 96; Eicher, p. 285; Salmon, pp. 103-104. Instead of pursuing a fleeing enemy, as his orders had directed, A.P. Hill attacked an entrenched Union position, losing about 2,000 of his 13,200 men in the failed attempt. Combined with his attacks at Mechanicsville the previous day, the Light Division had lost over a quarter of its men. General McClellan was encouraged by the telegrams Porter had sent back to his headquarters a few miles to the rear. He replied, \\"If the enemy are retiring and you are a chasseur, pitch in.\\" He also told Franklin to cross the river over the Duane bridge and attack the enemy's flank if he saw a chance, but he was dismayed to hear that the VI Corps commander had destroyed the bridge for fear of a possible enemy attack. At the same time, Brig. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner of the II Corps reported enemy activity in his front. McClellan's optimism was dashed, and he ordered that his headquarters' equipment be packed up in preparation for the retreat. On the Confederate side, General Lee had been an active participant in the failed assault, rallying his troops too close to the front for their comfort. As Longstreet arrived to the southwest of A.P. Hill, he saw the difficulty of attacking over such terrain and delayed until Stonewall Jackson could attack on Hill's left.Burton, pp. 94, 99-101; Sears, pp. 227. For the second time in the Seven Days, however, Jackson was late. A guide from the 4th Virginia Cavalry, Pvt. John Henry Timberlake, had misunderstood Jackson's intent and led him down the wrong road. After they counter-marched, losing about an hour, Jackson's troops found the road to Old Cold Harbor obstructed by trees felled by the retreating Union army and were harassed by sharpshooters, delaying their arrival. The first of Jackson's command to reach the battlefield was the division of Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, who was met by Lee's aide, Walter Taylor, and instructed to move into action immediately. Lee was concerned that Porter would counterattack the weakened troops of A.P. Hill, so he ordered Longstreet to conduct a diversionary attack to stabilize the lines until Jackson's full command could arrive and attack from the north. In Longstreet's attack, Brig. Gen. George E. Pickett's brigade attempted a frontal assault and was beaten back under severe fire with heavy losses. Pickett himself took a bullet to the shoulder, putting him out of action for the rest of the summer; Col. Eppa Hunton of the 8th Virginia assumed command of the brigade. Confederate President Jefferson Davis was among the party witnessing Pickett's failed attempt.Burton, pp. 102-104; Sears, pp. 227-28, 232-33; Welcher, p. 820. Ewell's attack Ewell began his attack immediately, around 3:30 p.m., without waiting for his entire division to come on line. General Lee's instructions were to advance along the same axis used by the brigades of Gregg and Branch, to maintain the momentum of the attack. He sent in his lead brigade, Louisianans under Col. Isaac Seymour, commanding in Maj. Gen. Richard Taylor's absence for medical reasons. Seymour was relatively inexperienced and his troops became confused in the woods and bogs of Boatswain's Swamp. Their confusion increased when Col. Seymour was killed by a Union rifle volley. Maj. Roberdeau Wheat, the colorful leader of the Louisiana Tigers Battalion, moved to the front to lead the brigade, but he was also killed with a bullet through his head. The Louisiana Brigade withdrew from the battle. Ewell's attack continued with two regiments from the brigade of Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble, but they could not advance beyond the swamp, falling with about 20% casualties. Porter was starting to receive reinforcements from Slocum's division and he brought forward troops to feed into gaps in his line. However, despite telegrams from Porter for more assistance, General McClellan gave no thought to the advantages of a counterattack. He asked his corps commanders south of the river whether they had any troops they could spare. When no one volunteered, he directed Sumner of the II Corps to send two brigades--about one tenth of the army--across the river, but because of the distances involved they would not reach the scene for another three hours.Sears, pp, 228-34; Eicher, p. 285; Burton, pp. 102-104, 113, 129; Kennedy, p. 96; Salmon, pp. 104-106. When Stonewall Jackson finally reached Old Cold Harbor, weary from the marching and counter-marching, he began to arrange his troops and those of D.H. Hill to trap the Federals he expected to be driven east by Longstreet and A.P. Hill. He soon received instructions from General Lee that informed him of the current situation and he began to prepare his command to assault the main Federal line. Faulty staff work prevented his men from moving forward for over an hour. While Jackson rode back and forth distractedly, his chaplain and chief of staff, Maj. Robert L. Dabney, took the initiative to find the divisions of Brig. Gens. William H. C. Whiting and Charles S. Winder and corrected the garbled instructions they had received. Lee met with Jackson on Telegraph Road and expressed his annoyance at the delay in getting to the battlefield by telling him \\"General, I am glad to see you and I only wish I could have been with you sooner.\\" Jackson muttered a reply that was inaudible under the noise of the battle. Lee then asked Jackson if his troops could stand the heavy enemy fire. \\"They can stand anything, they can stand that.\\" Jackson replied.Sears, pp, 234-35; Burton, pp. 110-11; Salmon, p. 106. General Confederate attack Lee's assault at 7 p.m. was conducted by 16 brigades, about 32,100 men. Porter had about 34,000 men to defend the line, but many of these were worn out from the previous attacks and command cohesion was hampered by feeding isolated reinforcements into the line to fill gaps. Nevertheless, they had the advantages of good defensible terrain and superiority in artillery. The Confederates were not able to advance simultaneously in a neat battle line over the 2.25-mile front, but rushed forward and were repulsed intermittently in smaller unit actions. On the Confederate left, D.H. Hill sent in his entire division except for Ripley's brigade, which had been badly mauled in the fighting at Beaver Dam Creek the previous day, but they encountered stiff resistance from George Sykes's regulars. The 20th North Carolina succeeded in overrunning a Union battery, its commander, Col. Alfred Iverson, who would later gain infamy at Gettysburg, was wounded in the assault. Meanwhile, the 5th Alabama's commander, Col. Charles Peuges, was mortally wounded and the regiment's colors captured by the 5th Maine. In the center were Brig. Gen Alexander Lawton's five Georgia regiments, a large new brigade in their first battle. Numbering close to 4000 men, the brigade was as big as the entire rest of Jackson's division. They pushed forward with the assistance of the Stonewall Brigade, along with Col. Samuel V. Fulkerson's brigade and Elzey's and Trimble's of Ewell's division. Jackson's division had the distinction of containing both the largest and smallest Confederate brigades on the field as his third brigade (temporarily commanded by Lt. Col Richard H. Cunningham since Brig. Gen John R. Jones was ill) numbered only a little over 1000 men, it was held in reserve and did not participate in the fighting. During the assault, Arnold Elzey was shot in the head, an injury that permanently removed him from active field command in the war and Col. James A. Walker of the 13th Virginia assumed command of Elzey's brigade. Samuel Fulkerson was shot in the chest and succumbed to his wound the next day. Col. Edward T.H. Warren of the 10th Virginia took command of the brigade. The Confederate right was opposed by the most difficult terrain, a quarter-mile open wheat field that sloped down to Boatswain's Swamp and then faced two lines of Union defenders on higher ground. James Longstreet ordered Pickett's brigade back into the action, supported by the brigades of Roger Pryor and Cadmus Wilcox, the other three brigades in the division being held in reserve. Longstreet wrote in his report, \\"I was, in fact, in the position from which the enemy wished us to attack him.\\"Sears, pp, 236-40; Burton, pp. 117-27. As the sun was starting to go down, William Whiting's division achieved the breakthrough on Longstreet's front. Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood's Texas Brigade moved forward swiftly and aggressively and broke a hole in the line. Four of the nine regimental commanders in Whiting's two brigades were killed or wounded, as well as Captain William Balthis, the division's chief of artillery. Pickett's brigade also succeeded in its second assault of the day. Confederate breakthroughs on their center and right could not be countered, and the Union line crumbled. A total of nine Union regimental commanders were killed or mortally wounded in the battle. Most of the 4th New Jersey, along with its colonel, were surrounded and taken prisoner by Longstreet's division; a lieutenant colonel assumed command of the remaining men in the regiment. Sykes's regulars conducted an orderly withdrawal from the McGehee house to Grapevine Bridge. The Union brigades of Brig. Gens. Thomas F. Meagher and William H. French arrived from the II Corps too late to help, other than as a rear guard for Porter's retreat. A battalion of the 5th U.S. Cavalry under Captain Charles J. Whiting made a desperate charge against the Texas Brigade, but were forced to surrender after heavy losses. By 4 a.m. on June 28, Porter had withdrawn across the Chickahominy, burning the bridges behind him. During the retreat from Gaines' Mill, Brig. Gen John F. Reynolds was also captured by the Confederates while sleeping under a tree.Burton, pp. 127-36; Kennedy, pp. 96-97; Sears, pp. 240-42; Salmon, p. 106; Welcher, p. 820. Aftermath Gaines' Mill was an intense battle, the largest of the Seven Days and the only clear-cut Confederate tactical victory of the Peninsula Campaign. Union casualties from the 34,214 engaged were 6,837 (894 killed, 3,107 wounded, and 2,836 captured or missing). Of the 57,018 Confederates engaged, losses totaled 7,993 (1,483 killed, 6,402 wounded, 108 missing or captured) including the loss of three brigade commanders and one general officer. For comparison, no Union general officers were killed or wounded and only one brigade commander, Col. Warren, who remained on the field (the chief of McCall's artillery, Maj. Henry DeHart, was also mortally wounded). Since the Confederate assault was conducted against only a small portion of the Union Army (the V Corps, one fifth of the army), the army emerged from the battle in relatively good shape overall. Lee's victory, his first of the war, could have been more complete if it were not for the mishaps of Stonewall Jackson. Historian Stephen W. Sears speculates that were it not for Jackson's misdirected march and his poor staff work, the major assault that Lee unleashed at 7 p.m. could have occurred three or four hours earlier. This would have put Porter in grave jeopardy, without any last-minute reinforcements and the cover of darkness. He quotes Edward Porter Alexander, prominent Confederate artillery officer and postwar historian: \\"Had Jackson attacked when he first arrived, or during A.P. Hill's attack, we would have had an easy victory--comparatively, & would have captured most of Porter's command.\\"Sears, pp. 249-50. Although McClellan had already planned to shift his supply base to the James River, his defeat unnerved him and he precipitously decided to abandon his advance on Richmond and begin the retreat of his entire army to the James. Gaines' Mill and the Union retreat across the Chickahominy was a psychological victory for the Confederacy, signaling that Richmond was out of danger.Sears, pp. 250-51.

Play centers on miniature figurines based the TV show Babylon 5. In 1999, it was nominated for the Origins Award for Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Miniatures Rules.Origins Award Nominees Announced The miniature produced of the Babylon 5 station won the award for \\"Best Vehicle Miniature of 1999\\" of the same year.1999 - Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design History The first edition of the game was published in 1997. The two men responsible were Bruce Graw and Robert Glass. The original rules were complex and the ship selection was minimal. The second edition was produced less than one year later. In it were several key rules revisions and clarifications. Over the lifespan of the game many supplements were released. With the supplements many new races and ships came about. Due to the cancellation of the Babylon 5 television show Agents of Gaming chose not to renew its contract. The game is out of print and with a new B5-based game \\"A Call to Arms\\" being produced by Mongoose Publishing, an official comeback is unlikely. However, a relatively strong player base continues to produce new, free content for the game system.  Canon  Due to the close cooperation with the creators of the show, the Babylon 5 Wars material published by Agents of Gaming is considered canon by J. Michael Straczynski.Graw, B. and Glass, R.: Babylon 5 Wars Second Edition Rules Compendium., page 1. Agents of Gaming, 2000 Babylon 5 Wars, the Game=Overview Each player assembles a fleet, represented by counters or miniatures, which equal to a set point limit. A player is generally limited to a single race to choose his ships. There is also a limit to ship usage based on fighter space, rarity, and year. The game is broken down into turns. Each player interacts in a turn at the same time. A die roll with certain bonuses determines movement order. Actions such as drift; power usage, electronic warfare, thrust, and fighter operations must be done every turn. A turn can be very long and complex. Some turns can take up to hours depending on fleet sizes. Supplied by supplements and rules expansions historic scenarios can also be played out. In a scenario, specific fleet composition is spelled out for each player along with map geography and objectives. Collecting Compared to other games in the tabletop miniature wargame genre the cost of a fighting force is relatively cheap. The majority of the ships published had associated minis made for them. A chronic problem with Agents of Gaming though was finding a reliable sculptor. Sometimes throughout the life of the game no miniatures would be released for months at a time. The only current source for B5W miniatures is online auction houses and discount bins at local gaming stores. Mongoose gaming is now producing some of the line of miniatures using, in many cases, exactly the same molds that Agents of Gaming used to produce them. Modeling A strong point of the game was its models. The ships were made with a high degree of quality. All ship models were released in pewter. Some ships were very large, taking up several base stands on the playing map. Armies/Races/Species This is a list of playable races (including one-off \\"Ship of the Month\\"s). This is for the most part complete, but is in the process of being revised. Please also note that there are a large number of races, both canon and non-canon, that have been made and developed unofficially. These include the canon Drakh and Lumati, possible takes on an independent Mars, and many more. Conversions have also been made to bring fleets from other universes into the game, including the TV shows Star Trek and BattleStar Galactica, as well as computer games such as FreeSpace and Star Control.

In that six-year spell, he won nine major honours with the club including domestic trebles in the 1998‚Äì99 and 2002‚Äì03 seasons, representing the side on more than 150 occasions in competitive football. Club career=Italy Amoruso began his career at local club, Bari, in 1988, for whom he went on to make 75 appearances, scoring 8 goals. Amoruso spent 1991-1993 on loan at Mantova and Pescara, but only featured intermittently. In 1995, he secured a move to Fiorentina, becoming club captain and making 54 appearances. He won the Coppa Italia in 1996 and in 1997 the Florence side went on a remarkable run in Europe where they reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners Cup only to lose out to eventual champions Barcelona. Rangers Following interest from Manchester United, Amoruso signed for Rangers on 29 May 1997 for a fee of ¬£4 million. Whilst with the club he won the Scottish Premier League on three occasions, as well as the Scottish Cup three times and the Scottish League Cup three times. He missed most of his debut season with an Achilles tendon injury, and didn't make his debut until April 1998 as a substitute for Gordan Petriƒá in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Celtic. He was then installed as captain of Rangers by Dick Advocaat in 1998. After returning to the team Amoruso was booed by Rangers fans after several poor displays and tactical errors. Amoruso also clashed with the manager several times, resulting in an eventually aborted move to Sunderland. Advocaat began to sign defenders to replace Amoruso, including Bert Konterman for example and Paul Ritchie, but the Italian remained after his replacements failed. Ritchie did not make a single appearance and Konterman was criticised to begin with, but, like Amoruso, he eventually found his way into the hearts of the fans. In December 1999, Amoruso issued a public apology after directing racist comments at Borussia Dortmund's Nigerian striker Victor Ikpeba. Earlier that day Amoruso's denied the allegations and threatened legal action in an interview to Corriere dello Sport ‚Äì Stadio (an Italian daily sports paper). The denials were described as \\"vehement\\" by the Daily Mail. He was later forced into a change of position, described as embarrassing by the Daily Mail and The Times, when TV footage contradicted his story. Subsequently, the BBC featured reports that Rangers supporters' racism had increased, in support of Amoruso. In the 2000‚Äì01 season, when Rangers exited the UEFA Champions League to Monaco partly because of another bad mistake by Amoruso, he was stripped of the captaincy (which went to the 22-year-old Barry Ferguson). Amoruso had captained the club for two years, the first ever Catholic to do so. He was left humiliatedFOOTBALL: Advocaat tore off armband and ripped out my heart; ADAPTED from LA CONFIDENTIAL: The Lorenzo Amoruso Story by David McCarthy and Keith Jackson priced pounds 9.99 by the demotion and later accused Advocaat of trying to destroy him. After Dick Advocaat's October 2000 attack on what he described as \\"fat necks\\" in his squad, reports named the Italian as a probable target. More errors had seen Amoruso again booed by his own teams' supporters. During this period Amoruso was linked with moves to English clubs Fulham and West Ham United. Advocaat was later removed as manager and Amoruso rediscovered his form under new boss Alex McLeish; winning the 2002 Scottish PFA Players' Player of the Year. After a four-match ban for spitting on James Grady, he scored the winning goal in his final game for Rangers‚Äîthe 2003 Scottish Cup final‚Äîand wept as he left the pitch. Blackburn Rovers Amoruso left Rangers in July 2003 to make a ¬£1.4 million move to Blackburn, who wanted him as a replacement for Henning Berg. The sale was forced by Rangers' large debts. His Blackburn debut came on 16 August 2003. On the pitch for the full ninety minutes, his place in the team appeared justified as he scored the opening goal after 17 minutes. In October, a knee injury kept him out of the game for five months. As he returned and came into the team on a sporadic basis playing only eighteen times for Blackburn. His 2004‚Äì05 season was marred by regular injuries and he did not play any part of the 2005‚Äì06 season. He was released by Rovers in the summer of 2006. In January 2008, Amoruso briefly came out of retirement to sign for Cosmos of San Marino on a part-time basis. International career Amoruso represented Italy at the 1987 FIFA U-16 World Championship and won two caps at Under 21 level. He was never selected by Italy at full international level, which Amoruso attributed to a \\"strange mentality\\" pervading his homeland. He blamed Giovanni Trapattoni, Cesare Maldini and Dino Zoff for failing to provide him with the call-up he felt he deserved. In 2004 Amoruso expressed a desire to play for Scotland, through residency. He said: \\"I began to feel like part of me was Scottish.\\" After retirement On 15 September 2010, Amoruso was hired by his former club Fiorentina as a scout for the first team. After almost two years with the club, he stepped down from his role.

Through a variety of factors, it developed much more slowly than Canada's popular rock music scene, and apart from a short-lived burst of mainstream popularity from 1989 to 1991, it remained largely an underground phenomenon until the early 2000s. Canada had hip hop artists right from the early days of the scene‚Äîthe first known English Canadian rap single, Singing Fools' \\"The Bum Rap\\", was released in 1982,Singing Fools at Jam!'s Pop Music Encyclopedia. and the first French rap single, Lucien Franc≈ìur's \\"Le Rap-√†-Billy\\", was released in 1983.\\"Aut'Chose: Chaud comme un jukebox\\" .

Toronto Star, January 28, 2011. For the most part, however, the infrastructure simply wasn't there to get most artists' music to the record-buying public. Even if a Canadian hip hop artist could get signed to a record label at all, it was very difficult for them to get widespread exposure. Even if their music videos were played on MuchMusic, many artists still couldn't get their records into stores or played on the radio. A few Canadian hip hop artists did break through to mainstream success around 1990, and a few Canadian acts such as Maestro Fresh-Wes, Main Source and Dream Warriors and Dan-e-o even gained cult-status recognition internationally from the underground hip hop scene. However, through much of the following decade Canadian hip hop acts experienced a slowdown without any significant artists breaking through to the mainstream. Although many hip hop musicians continued to record and tour, not one Canadian hip hop song reached even the Top 100 on the Canadian pop charts between 1992 and 1998. Beginning in 1998, however, a sequence of events spurred by the anthemic collaborative single \\"Northern Touch\\" finally brought hip hop back into the mainstream of Canadian music. Canada's propensity to create quality artists who rarely achieved public recognition prompted Allmusic to state that Canadian hip hop is the \\"best-kept secret in hip-hop.\\"[ Kardinal Offishall > Biography], Allmusic, October 21, 2008 The current hip hop scene in Canada is mainly growing in Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, Greater Montreal, and Greater Calgary. History=Late 1980s/early 1990s: The rise of Canadian hip hop Artists such as Devon, Maestro Fresh-Wes and Dream Warriors did manage, for a brief time in the late '80s and early '90s, to break into the mainstream. In 1989, Maestro's first single, \\"Let Your Backbone Slide\\", was the first Canadian hip-hop single to break into the national Top 40, and the first to make the Billboard charts in the United States. It remained the bestselling Canadian hip hop single of all time until 2008. Other notable rap singles of this era include Maestro's \\"Drop the Needle\\", Devon's \\"Mr. Metro\\", Dream Warriors' \\"My Definition of a Boombastic Jazz Style\\" and \\"Wash Your Face in My Sink\\", Ground Control's \\"Another Dope Jam\\", MCJ and Cool G's \\"No Sex With My Sister\\" and \\"So Listen\\", and Kish's \\"I Rhyme the World in 80 Days\\". Michie Mee became, in 1988, the first Canadian rapper to sign a deal with an American record label. This action did not result in significant chart success for her‚Äîshe has asserted in interviews that the reggae influences on her 1991 debut album Jamaican Funk‚ÄîCanadian Style met with resistance from American label executives and radio programmers.Border Block - Canadian Hip Hop vs. America , CBC.ca, March 22, 2005. The Get Loose Crew released an independent mini LP in March 1988 from their own record label East Park Productions with global distribution, thus becoming the first Canadian rap group with international record sales. The group featured the first recorded white rapper MC Shadow in Canada. The group disbanded in 1990 forming notable groups JUST Me, B-Kool who was the 1991 Juno Award winner for Best R&B; Soul Recording for \\"Dance to the Music\\".1991 Juno Awards at JunoAwards.ca and Self-Defence. In addition, DJs K-Cut and Sir Scratch of the Toronto/New York-based hip-hop group Main Source were Toronto natives. In 1991, Main Source released the hip- hop classic Breaking Atoms, which featured the debut of a young Nas before his rise in popularity. Rap also began to surface in Canadian mainstream pop in the early 1990s. Rapper Frankie Fudge performed a rap break in Celine Dion's 1990 single \\"Unison\\" and appeared in her video. Female R&B; duo Love and Sas performed rap in their 1991 single \\"I Don't Need Yo' Kiss\\". An important influence in the development of hip hop in Toronto was Ron Nelson and his Fantastic Voyage radio show which aired Saturday afternoons on CKLN-FM from 1983 to 1991. Fantastic Voyage was the first exposure many youths had to the hip hop genre and also provided the first airplay for many Toronto artists including Maestro Fresh Wes, Michee Mee, Rumble & Strong, Get Loose Crew, Simply Majestic and the Dream Warriors. Nelson was also an early hip hop concert promoter, organizing the first major hip hop concert in Canada at Varsity Stadium in 1987 featuring Run DMC, Public Enemy and EPMD, and provided exposure for local artists at venues such as the Concert Hall, the Spectrum, and the Party Centre.http://startouch.thestar.com/screens/e95712c1-e4d7-459c-93c3-17f30c2367a8%7C_0.html In addition, Nelson helped set up events in Toronto that drew in well-known American hip hop acts, such as Big Daddy Kane and Run DMC. The first urban- radio show in BC was known as 'Soul Sonic Shocks' in 1987 and was hosted by Bay-Area native DJ Maximus Clean. Vancouver's first all-rap radio show \\"In Effect,\\" began in 1989 by Niel Scobie at CITR 101.9 fm at UBC. Early to mid-1990s In 1990, Denham Jolly's company Milestone Radio applied to the CRTC for an urban music station in Toronto, which would have been the first such station in Canada, but that application was denied in favour of a country music station‚Äîwhich Toronto already had on its radio dial.CRTC Decision 90-993 The decision was controversial, and hurt the Canadian hip hop scene considerably. Hip-hop and R&B; fans in Toronto relied on Buffalo, New York's WBLK, an American station with no Canadian content responsibilities, while other Canadian cities often had no access to any urban music radio stations at all. After 1992, Michie Mee was the only Canadian rapper to make an appearance on the national pop charts until 1998‚Äîand even she didn't accomplish the feat with a hip hop song, but by partnering with the alternative rock band Raggadeath for 1995's \\"One Life\\". Sol Guy, a hip hop promoter with Figure IV Entertainment, said in 1999 that A special collaborative single, \\"Can't Repress the Cause\\", was released under the name Dance Appeal to advocate for greater inclusion of hip hop in the mainstream of Canadian music.\\"Urban Music\\" .

Ottawa-based hip-hop group Organized Rhyme, which featured a young Tom Green before his rise to fame, had some success on MuchMusic with \\"Check the O.R.\\" in 1993, but did not receive widespread radio airplay or reach the RPM charts. Maestro Fresh-Wes, who moved to New York City in 1992 and attempted to break into the American market with the albums Maestro Zone and Naaah, Dis Kid Can't Be from Canada?!!, found his career faltering in this era. Snow, who had a number one Billboard hit in 1993 with \\"Informer\\", is sometimes mistakenly labelled a rapper, but in fact his style was more accurately described as dancehall, a style of reggae, than as hip hop. Many American hip hop artists were popular in Canada,\\"Major Rappers Rebound on Canadian Labels\\". Billboard, November 12, 1994. and Black Canadian musicians such as Infidels, Deborah Cox and The Philosopher Kings had notable successes in the R&B;, pop and rock genres; however, even the most prominent Canadian hip hop acts during this era, including Ghetto Concept, Rascalz, Farm Fresh, TBTBT, Graphidi Logik and Hip Club Groove, struggled to gain any kind of commercial traction. Although Toronto-market radio stations CHOG and CING-FM began to include some Canadian hip hop songs in their contemporary hit radio formats, the hip hop audience in the city remained loyal to WBLK‚Äîand for most artists the only venues available for reaching an audience anywhere outside of the Greater Toronto Area were campus radio and MuchMusic's RapCity and X-Tendamix. That began to change in 1996, when the Urban Music Association of Canada was formed to build the domestic and international profile of Canadian urban music. The following year, Dubmatique broke through as the first Quebec rap band to top Canada's francophone pop charts, and some controversy erupted in Toronto when Milestone was again passed over for an urban radio station on its second application. Instead, the CBC was awarded 99.1 to move its existing Radio One station, CBLA, from the AM band‚Äîand, ominously, this was believed at the time to be the last available FM frequency in the city. The CRTC decision was not met with as much uproar as there had been in 1990, because the ruling was not seen as much of a shock; indeed, it seemed like a foregone conclusion that the CBC would receive the frequency. The most notable Canadian hip hop album during this era, Rap Essentials Volume One, was a compilation which featured the debut singles of both Kardinal Offishall and Choclair. 1998: Northern Touch However, 1998 proved to be a transformative year in the development of Canadian hip hop, as the Vancouver hip hop band Rascalz quite unexpectedly found themselves at the centre of a sequence of events which gave Canadian hip hop an unprecedented level of media attention, leading the Canadian music and broadcasting industries to make a number of structural changes which would ultimately give hip hop musicians a more stable and commercially visible platform going into the 21st century. First, Rascalz won the Juno Award for Best Rap Recording for their 1997 album Cash Crop. Because of Canadian hip hop's lack of commercial visibility, the award was presented during the non- televised portion of the ceremony, along with the technical awards, rather than at the televised main gala. The band had not yet arrived at the ceremony when the award was announced‚Äîwhen they did arrive, they were simply pulled aside and told that they had won the award.\\"Rascalz Refuse Award To Protest Junos: Rap Act Wants R&B; Portion Of Ceremony Televised\\" , Billboard, April 4, 1998. Alleging that racism was a factor in the award's scheduling, the band refused to accept the award.\\"Kinder, gentler rap, eh? Canadians hip-hop onto centre stage\\" , Ottawa Citizen, March 7, 1999. Speaking to the press afterward, the group and their co-manager said that For several weeks cultural critics and hip hop musicians debated the issue in the press‚Äîsome suggested, in fact, that the hip hop award's lack of visibility could be seen as not just a result of Canadian hip hop's poor commercial performance, but also a contributing factor. Soon afterward, Rascalz released \\"Northern Touch\\", a collaboration with emerging rappers Checkmate, Kardinal Offishall, Thrust and Choclair. Originally recorded in 1997 for a compilation album that fell through and was never released, the band opted to release it as a standalone single in 1998.\\"Hit single \\"Northern Touch\\" still notorious 15 years after tearing up charts\\". Canadian Press, May 14, 2013. It became a galvanizing statement of purpose for Canadian hip hop musicians and beat the odds to become the first Canadian hip hop hit since 1991.Canadian hip hop gets the Northern Touch , NOW, June 4, 1998. Although the song just barely missed the national Top 40 charts, peaking at number 41 in RPM, it reached the Top 10 in most major markets, and was the first Canadian hip hop song to reach the Top 100 at all, and the first to garner widespread radio airplay both in Canada and internationally, since 1991. Maestro Fresh-Wes, now known simply as Maestro, also broke his own hit jinx in 1998, with \\"Stick to Your Vision\\"‚Äîbuoyed, in part, by a Guess Who sample‚Äîbecoming his first Top 40 hit in seven years. Although he would not actually reach the Top 40 until 2001's \\"BaKardi Slang\\", Kardinal Offishall also made his first appearance as a solo artist in RPM's Top 100 in 1998, peaking at number 91 with \\"On wit da Show\\". Artists such as Choclair, Jelleestone and Saukrates were also beginning to make waves in the press, as the year's more dramatic events renewed attention on Canadian hip hop. As a result of the Rascalz controversy, the Junos moved the Rap award to the main ceremony the following year. It was won by \\"Northern Touch\\". The participating artists performed the song live at the ceremony, the first time a hip hop group had ever performed live on the Juno stage.\\"Kinder, gentler rap, eh?: Canadians hip-hop onto centre stage\\". Ottawa Citizen, March 7, 1999. At the Juno Awards of 2018, the \\"Northern Touch All-Stars\\" were selected as presenters of the Rap award.\\"Surprises abound as 'Northern Touch' rappers take over Junos for performance\\". Halifax Chronicle-Herald, March 25, 2018. Winner Tory Lanez was not in attendance at the ceremony, and after accepting the award on his behalf, the group launched into an a cappella rendition of \\"Northern Touch\\" in lieu of the time that would otherwise have been taken by Lanez' acceptance speech. Although presented as an impromptu decision, CARAS president Allan Reid later admitted that he had encouraged the musicians to do it.\\"Surprises abound in upbeat Juno Awards show in Vancouver\\". Whitehorse Star, March 26, 2018. 2000s: The breakthrough On June 18, 1999, the CBC's Toronto station completed its move to FM. Because the FM frequency offered better broadcast coverage of the region, the CBC found that it was able to surrender two FM repeater transmitters serving communities outside of the city‚Äîthus opening two new frequencies for license applications. In response, the federal cabinet issued an Order in Council to the CRTC directing it to give precedence to applications that took into account Toronto's cultural and racial diversity,CRTC Public Notice 2000-144 effectively guaranteeing that Milestone would get a license in the new round of hearings. On June 16, 2000, the CRTC awarded one of the frequencies to Milestone, on the company's third attempt.CRTC Decision 2000-203 The other frequency was awarded to Aboriginal Voices for a station to serve First Nations communities. At the beginning of this same year, the internet became home to Canada's largest rap/hip-hop website publication and community, HipHopCanada.com. Also in 2000, the CBC created and aired Drop the Beat, a television series about hip hop music and culture which was billed as one of the first such series in the world.\\"TV show puts spotlight on hip-hop\\". Sudbury Star, February 9, 2000. The show starred Merwin Mondesir and Mark Taylor as the hosts of a hip hop show on a campus radio station; the cast also included Michie Mee, DJ Shamann and Kardinal Offishall. As a tie-in to help promote emerging hip hop musicians, the series released a soundtrack album in conjunction with the first season, featuring artists such as Maestro Fresh Wes, Infinite, Frankie Ano, Bahamadia, Ja Rule, Black Child, Choclair, Rahzel, Jully Black and Erykah Badu.\\"Drop the Beat becomes a CD: Canada's first hip hop TV show releases soundtrack\\". National Post, March 7, 2000. Finally, in 2001, CFXJ (Flow 93.5) debuted as Canada's first urban music station. Urban stations quickly followed in several other Canadian cities, as well, and for the first time, Canadian hip hop artists had a network of radio outlets for their music‚Äîas well as numerous record labels committed to rectifying their past lack of interest in the genre. In the 2000s, numerous Canadian hip hop artists, including Kardinal Offishall, Drake, Classified, k-os, K'naan, Swollen Members, Sweatshop Union, Buck 65, Belly, Moka Only, Lil 808, Shad, Kyprios and Cadence Weapon, as well as many R&B; artists, have emerged as mainstream stars. Cadence Weapon, in fact, was named poet laureate of Edmonton, Alberta in 2009.\\"Cadence Weapon Sworn In As Edmonton's Poet Laureate\\" . Exclaim!, May 26, 2009. In addition to terrestrial radio, the national satellite radio networks CBC Radio 3 and Bande √† part, which are both dedicated to Canadian independent music of any genre, also include numerous emerging hip hop artists in their playlists. Bande √† part has produced a compilation album of unsigned Quebec hip hop artists, 93 tours, which it distributed as a free download from its website.\\"93 Tours: Hip Hop Qu√©bec\\" . CBC Music, September 4, 2007. Several prominent contemporary hip hop artists, including Shad, Cadence Weapon, K'naan, Sweatshop Union, Radio Radio and Omnikrom, have in fact risen to prominence through these channels instead of through terrestrial radio. Apart from a few major stars, however, the hip hop scene has faced continued struggle. Virtually all of the urban-format radio stations which debuted in the early 2000s, including Flow 93.5, have since shifted from a pure urban format to a rhythmic contemporary format. While the stations still play some hip hop, they now focus far more on artists who have already established crossover Top 40 appeal‚Äîmeaning that emerging artists can no longer rely on the stations to help them build their audience. In 2010, further, Milestone announced a deal to sell Flow 93.5 to CHUM Radio, a division of the mainstream media conglomerate CTVglobemedia.CHUM Radio buys Toronto's New Flow 93.5 FM from Milestone. Canadian Business, June 23, 2010. (Following another sale, Flow 93.5 is now owned by Newcap Broadcasting as of March 2014, and now airs a rhythmic adult contemporary format branded as \\"The Move\\".) However, a new radio station, CKFG-FM, was licensed to Toronto in 2011 as a community radio station authorized to broadcast a broad spectrum of African and Caribbean musical genres, including hip hop, reggae, soca and rhythm and blues.\\"Caribbean radio station set for Toronto at 98.7 FM\\" . Toronto Star, February 2, 2011. Canadian hip hop musicians have also continued to face obstacles when attempting to break into the American and international markets. Music critics and journalists have sometimes attributed this to the perception, real or imagined, that stereotypes of Canada as a land of igloos and hosers get in the way of Canadian rappers being taken seriously. As early as 1994, noted Canadian hip hop record producer Derek Brin was telling Billboard that \\"Americans like something that sounds American. From here, it seems if you don't have that sound, you ain't it.\\" It was not until 2008, when Kardinal Offishall reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with a collaboration with established American star Akon, \\"Dangerous\\", that a Canadian rapper had a major chart hit in the United States. He was shortly followed by Drake, whose 2009 single \\"Best I Ever Had\\" reached number 2 on the Hot 100 and another major international breakthrough came in 2009 when a remixed version of K'naan's single \\"Wavin' Flag\\" was announced as the official Coca-Cola theme song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.OFFICIAL SONG OF 2010 WORLD CUP welcometo21.com 2010s - Present: New Toronto sound Toronto based artist Drake has since dominated the Canadian hip-hop scene with his last eight albums/mixtapes and playlist peaking at number-one on the US Billboard 200 album chart; Thank Me Later (2010), Take Care (2011), Nothing Was The Same (2013), If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015), What A Time To Be Alive (2015), Views (2016), More Life (2017), and Scorpion. Drake's 2016 dancehall/afrobeats-infused single \\"One Dance\\" is the most successful Canadian hip-hop song of all-time, charting at number-one on the singles charts in 15 different countries, including the U.S and UK, making it the first Canadian hip-hop single to peak at number-one on the US Billboard Hot 100. Drake had a large impact on Canadian hip hop, as after The Weeknd was involved in Take Care his popularity rose dramatically. Numerous other Canadian hip hop and rhythm and blues artists from the Greater Toronto Area, including The Weeknd, PARTYNEXTDOOR, Majid Jordan, Roy Woods, NAV, Dvsn and Tory Lanez, have also attained wider international prominence in this era. French Canadian hip hop Montreal, being Canada's second largest city and one of the world's largest French-speaking cities, has developed its own niche of French language hip hop, which later spread to Quebec City and throughout the province of Quebec. The first known francophone Canadian rap single, Lucien Franc≈ìur's 1983 song \\"Le Rap-√†-Billy\\", was not conventional hip hop as that term is understood today, but featured Franc≈ìur rapping over a hybrid funk-rockabilly track which presaged the much later rap rock genre. Although a few French rap singles broke through to mainstream success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as Les French B's \\"Je m'en souviens\\", Kool Rock and Jay Tree's \\"M.R.F. est arriv√©\\", Le Boyfriend's \\"Rapper chic (Je rap en fran√ßais)\\" and D√©d√© Track√©'s \\"T'es qui to√©\\",Tony Mitchell, Global noise: rap and hip-hop outside the USA. Wesleyan University Press. P. 311. as in English Canada this early success was not sustained, and francophone hip hop remained largely an underground phenomenon until the emergence of Dubmatique, who became in 1997 the first francophone Canadian hip hop group to have a number-one hit on Canada's francophone Top 40 charts. Their debut album titled Dubmatique went platinum, and they received a number of rewards, most notably from MuchMusic and ADISQ. In 2005, The Dope Poet Society released a multilingual single and video entitled, \\"All of Us\\" off the album ProIntelpro: Promote Intelligence Program. Lead vocalist ProfessorD.us raps in both English and French on the track, accompanied by a posse of six other rappers rhyming in a total of five different languages. The most internationally successful hip hop musician from Quebec is Ghislain Poirier, a producer whose own albums primarily feature francophone rappers from Quebec and France, but who is also now an influential remixer equally sought after by anglophone rappers and dance musicians from Canada and the United States. Roi Heenok, a rapper from Montreal, has become an Internet phenomenon in France, and has performed in Paris three times since 2004. Other significant francophone rappers who have emerged in 21st century have included Muzion, Manu Militari, Yvon Krev√©, Loco Locass, Catburglaz, Atach Tatuq, Taktika, Sans Pression, Omnikrom, Anodajay, Gatineau, Radio Radio, Alaclair Ensemble, Boogat, Koriass, Loud Lary Ajust, Sarahm√©e, Pierre Kwenders, Tizzo and Treizi√®me Etage. Indigenous hip hop Hip hop has been also a prominent influence on contemporary First Nations and M√©tis youth culture since the 1990s.\\"Inuit pop, Algonquin rap, Innu reggae aim for mainstream\\" . Agence France-Presse, October 8, 2009. The first indigenous hip hop video to garner any airplay from MuchMusic was War Party's socially- conscious \\"Feelin' Reserved\\" in 2001. The group went on to win the Canadian Aboriginal Music Award for Rap Album of the Year and tour internationally, representing Canada at the World Expo in Nagoya, Japan, and performing at the First Americans Festival at the Smithsonian Museum.

In 2009, Team Rezofficial became the first indigenous hip hop group with a song on the RapCity Top Ten. The song \\"Lonely\\" went to number one. In the same year, Manitoba's Native Communications radio network launched Streetz FM, a hip hop station in Winnipeg which was Canada's first radio station marketed primarily to indigenous youth.\\"New station on the air with aboriginal hip-hop\\" . Winnipeg Sun, December 15, 2009. Besides music, hip hop culture has had a major impact on urban indigenous youth in Canada in areas such as fashion, visual art, and so on. In 2013, the Vancouver Art Gallery toured the show Beat Nation: Art, Hip Hop and Aboriginal Culture showing works by indigenous artists influenced by hip hop themes.\\"Hip-Hop's Aboriginal Connection\\" . NPR, January 3, 2014. Influences Although American East Coast hip hop and West Coast hip hop are major influences on Canadian artists in the genre, Canadian hip hop also incorporates a number of other influences not commonly seen in the mainstream of the American genre. The Black Canadian community is much more dominated by people of Caribbean heritage than is the African American community in the United States, and as a result, Canadian hip hop is significantly influenced by the rhythms and styles of Caribbean music. English Canadian hip hop tends to be influenced by Jamaican, Trinidadian and Bahamian styles, while francophone hip hop from Quebec is commonly influenced by French Antillean, Dominican or Haitian music. Artists such as Drake, Michie Mee, Dream Warriors, Ghetto Concept, and Kardinal Offishall have incorporated dancehall or reggae into their music. Even those artists who do not use an obvious Caribbean sounds are often influenced by Caribbean English and themes. A famous example is the Kardinal Offishall song \\"BaKardi Slang\\", which gives examples of Toronto black youth slang‚Äîmany derived from Caribbean speech. As well, Rastafarian vocabulary, speaking of good as \\"Zion\\" and evil as \\"Babylon\\" for example, is quite common, even if the rappers are not themselves Rasta. The genre-hopping \\"Tom Waits with a beatbox\\" style of Buck 65, who integrates country, rock, folk and blues influences into his music, has also become a major influence on Canadian hip hop in the 2000s. His influence is especially strong on hip hop artists from the Maritime provinces, such as Classified, but can also be seen in artists such as Ridley Bent and Mcenroe. Electronic music is also a significant influence, notably seen in artists such as Cadence Weapon, No Luck Club, Tre Mission, Kaytranada and Ghislain Poirier, and jazz music has been incorporated since the early 1990s, particularly in the work of Dream Warriors, Social Deviantz, Mood Ruff and Da Grassroots. Artists such as K'naan, k-os, Grand Analog, Touch and Nato, Dragon Fli Empire, DL Incognito and Graph Nobel have pursued styles which blend a diverse mix of hip hop, rock, jazz, world music, and R&B; influences.

The main body of the Union Army of the Potomac began a general withdrawal toward the James River. Confederate Brig. Gen. John B. Magruder pursued along the railroad and the Williamsburg Road and struck Maj. Gen. Edwin Vose Sumner's II Corps (the Union rearguard) with three brigades near Savage's Station, while Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's divisions were stalled north of the Chickahominy River. Union forces continued to withdraw across White Oak Swamp, abandoning supplies and more than 2,500 wounded soldiers in a field hospital. Background= Military situation  The Seven Days Battles began with a Union attack in the minor Battle of Oak Grove on June 25, 1862, but Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and his Army of the Potomac quickly lost the initiative as Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia began a series of attacks at Beaver Dam Creek on June 26, Gaines' Mill on June 27, and the minor actions at Garnett's and Golding's Farm on June 27 and June 28. The Army of the Potomac continued its retreat toward the James River.Salmon, p. 64. The bulk of McClellan's army concentrated around Savage's Station on the Richmond and York River Railroad, preparing for a difficult crossing through and around White Oak Swamp. It did so without centralized direction because McClellan had personally moved south of Malvern Hill after Gaines' Mill without leaving directions for corps movements during the retreat nor naming a second in command. Clouds of black smoke filled the air as the Union troops were ordered to burn anything they could not carry. Union morale plummeted, particularly so for those wounded, who realized that they were not being evacuated from Savage's Station with the rest of the Army.Eicher, p. 290; Salmon, p. 111. Lee devised a complex plan to pursue and destroy McClellan's army. While the divisions of Maj. Gens. James Longstreet and A.P. Hill looped back toward Richmond and then southeast to the crossroads at Glendale, and Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes's division headed farther south, to the vicinity of Malvern Hill, Brig. Gen. John B. Magruder's division was ordered to move due east along the Williamsburg Road and the York River Railroad to attack the Federal rear guard. Stonewall Jackson, commanding his own division, as well as the divisions of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill and Brig. Gen. William H. C. Whiting, was to rebuild a bridge over the Chickahominy and head due south to Savage's Station, where he would link up with Magruder and deliver a strong blow that might cause the Union Army to turn around and fight during its retreat.Sears, p. 261; Salmon, p. 110; Eicher, p. 290. McClellan's rear guard at Savage's Station consisted of the II Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner (two divisions), the III Corps, under Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman (two divisions), and the VI Corps, under Brig. Gen. William B. Franklin (one division). McClellan considered his senior corps commander, Sumner, to be incompetent, so he appointed no one to command the rear guard.Eicher, p. 290; Sears, p. 261; Salmon, p. 111. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle Plan of the Battle of Savage Station Initial contact between the armies occurred at 9 a.m. on June 29. On the farm and orchards owned by a Mr. Allen, about west of Savage's Station, two Georgia regiments from the brigade of Brig. Gen. George T. Anderson fought against two Pennsylvania regiments from Sumner's corps for about two hours before disengaging, suffering 28 casualties to the Pennsylvanians' 119. The highest ranking casualty was Confederate Brig. Gen. Richard Griffith, who was mortally wounded by a Union shell fragment.Sears, pp. 265-66. Magruder, who was alleged to be under the influence of morphine to combat a bout of indigestion, was confused and became concerned that he might be attacked by a superior force. He requested reinforcements from Lee, who ordered two brigades from the division of Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger to assist, under the condition that they would have to be returned if they were not engaged by 2 p.m.Salmon, p. 111. Meanwhile, Jackson was not advancing as Lee had planned. He was taking time to rebuild bridges over the Chickahominy and he received a garbled order from Lee's chief of staff that made him believe he should stay north of the river and guard the crossings. These failures of the Confederate plan were being matched on the Union side, however. Heintzelman decided on his own that his corps was not needed to defend Savage's Station, Sumner's and Franklin's being sufficient, so he decided to follow the rest of the army without informing his fellow generals.Eicher, p. 291; Sears, p. 267; Salmon, pp. 111-12. Magruder was forced to give up the two brigades from Huger's division at 2 p.m. and was faced with the problem of attacking Sumner's 26,600 men with his own 14,000. He hesitated until 5 p.m., when he sent only two and a half brigades forward. Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw commanded the left flank, Brig. Gen. Paul J. Semmes the center, and Col. William Barksdale (Griffith's Brigade) the right. Franklin and Brig. Gen. John Sedgwick were on a reconnaissance to the west of Savage's Station when they saw Kershaw's brigade approaching. Their immediate assumption was that these were men from Heintzelman's corps, but they soon realized their mistake. This was the first indication of Heintzelman's unannounced departure and Sumner, for one, was particularly outraged, refusing to speak to Heintzelman the following day. Union artillery opened fire and pickets were sent forward to meet the assault.Salmon, p. 112; Sears, p. 270. Magruder's attack was accompanied by the first armored railroad battery to be used in combat. Earlier in June, General Lee had hoped to counter the approach of McClellan's siege artillery by rail by using his own weapon: a 32-pounder Brooke naval rifle, shielded by a sloping casemate of railroad iron, nicknamed the \\"Land Merrimack.\\" It was pushed by a locomotive at about the speed of the marching infantry.Sears, pp. 269-70. However, even with this impressive weapon, which outgunned anything the Federal artillerists possessed, the results of Magruder's decision to send only part of his smaller force against a much larger enemy were predictable.Eicher, p. 291. The first Union unit to engage was one of Sedgwick's brigades, Philadelphians led by Brig. Gen. William W. Burns, but his defensive line proved inadequate to cover the two brigade front of Kershaw and Semmes. Sumner managed this part of the battle erratically, selecting regiments for combat almost at random. He sent in two of Burns's regiments, and then the 1st Minnesota Infantry from another brigade in Sedgwick's division, and finally one regiment each from two different brigades in Brig. Gen. Israel B. Richardson's division. By the time all of these units reached the front, the two sides were at rough parity--two brigades each. Although Magruder had been conservative about his attack, Sumner was even more so. Of the 26 regiments he had in his corps, only 10 were engaged at Savage's Station.Sears, p. 271; Salmon, p. 112. The fighting turned into a bloody stalemate as darkness fell and strong thunderstorms began to move in. The Land Merrimack bombarded the Union front, with some of its shells reaching as far to the rear as the field hospital. The final actions of the evening were by the Vermont Brigade, commanded by Colonel William T. H. Brooks, of Brig. Gen. William F. \\"Baldy\\" Smith's division. Attempting to hold the flank south of the Williamsburg Road, the Vermonters charged into the woods and were met with murderous fire, suffering more casualties of any brigade on the field that day. The brigade as a whole took 439 casualties; the 5th Vermont regiment, commanded by Lt. Col. Lewis A. Grant, lost nearly half of its men, 209 of 428.Sears, pp. 271-72; Eicher, p. 291. Aftermath Savage Station, Va. Field hospital after the battle. June 30, 1862Battles and Leaders of the Civil War .p.687 (Gibson, James F., photographer). The battle was a stalemate at the cost of about 1,500 casualties on both sides, plus 2,500 previously wounded Union soldiers who were left to be captured when their field hospital was evacuated. Stonewall Jackson eventually crossed the river by about 2:30 a.m. on June 30, but it was too late to crush the Union Army, as Lee had hoped. Most of the Army of the Potomac crossed White Oak Swamp Creek unmolested by noon on June 30. General Lee reprimanded Magruder in a dispatch: \\"I regret much that you have made so little progress today in the pursuit of the enemy. In order to reap the fruits of our victory that pursuit should be most vigorous. ... We must lose no more time or he will escape us entirely.\\" However, the fault for the lost opportunity must be shared equally with the poor staff work at Lee's own headquarters and a less than aggressive performance by Jackson. The Seven Days continued with the much larger Battle of Glendale and the Battle of White Oak Swamp on June 30.Sears, p. 274; Salmon, p. 112; Eicher, p. 291.

The species is native to New Guinea, some islands in Indonesia, and the Cape York Peninsula in Australia. First described by Hermann Schlegel in 1872, it was known for many years as Chondropython viridis. As its common name suggests, it is a bright green snake that can reach a total length (including tail) of and a weight of , with females slightly larger and heavier than males. Living generally in trees, the green tree python mainly hunts and eats small reptiles and mammals. It is a popular pet, and numbers in the wild have suffered with large-scale smuggling of wild-caught green tree pythons in Indonesia. Despite this, the green tree python is rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of endangered species. Names M. viridis is known as klngan in the Kalam language of Papua New Guinea.Bulmer RNH, Menzies JI, Parker F (1975). \\"Kalam Classification of Reptiles and Fishes\\". Journal of the Polynesian Society 84 (3): 267‚Äì308. Taxonomy German naturalist Hermann Schlegel described the green tree python in 1872 as Python viridis, (in Dutch). from two specimens collected in the Aru Islands of Indonesia. His countryman Adolf Bernhard Meyer erected the genus Chondropython (though recognised similarity to Morelia) and described the green tree python as Chondropython azureus in 1874, (in German). from a specimen collected in \\"Kordo\\", later determined to be Korido on Biak Island. This was destroyed in World War II. French naturalist Henri √âmile Sauvage described Chondropython pulcher from a specimen from Mansinam Island, Irian Jaya. For many years, the green tree python was classified as the only species of the genus Chondropython, with the binomial name C. viridis. In 1993, Professor Arnold G. Kluge published a detailed phylogenetic analysis that found that the green tree python was nested within the genus Morelia and most closely related to the rough-scaled python (M. carinata). Hence, it became Morelia viridis. Two studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA published in 2013 and 2014 came up with differing results, one confirming the species in Morelia, the other placing it as an early offshoot with the Children's python genus Antaresia. This latter result was thought anomalous by later researchers. Raymond Hoser described the Australian population as a separate subspecies Chondropython viridis shireenae, after his wife Shireen, noting that the taxon consistently had white markings along the backbone, whereas snakes from New Guinea and Indonesia only sometimes had this trait, and the molecular analysis would bear out the distinctness. A genetic study by Lesley Rawlings and Stephen Donnellan in 2003 of mitochondrial DNA of the green tree python found two distinct lineages: a southern lineage comprising populations of Australia, Aru Islands, and New Guinea south of the central highlands, and a northern lineage of New Guinea north of the central highlands and Vogelkop Peninsula, and Biak Island. The two likely diverged around 5 million years ago with the rising of the central mountain range in New Guinea. The authors suggested this might explain poor breeding success in Australia if people were unknowingly trying to breed the northern and southern green tree pythons, as they were not closely related. The two taxa are indistinguishable in appearance. Description The green tree python is characterized by a relatively slim body. The relatively long tail accounts for about 14% of the total length. The head is large and clearly defined from the neck. The snout is large and angular. The body is triangular in cross section with a visible spine. The species usually reaches a total length (including tail) of , but large females may reach . The size also varies depending on the region of origin. The weight is highly dependent upon the nutritional status of the animal. Males can weigh about , females up to , although wild specimens are typically much lighter than this. Especially large specimens that can weigh up to are invariably females, which, like most snakes, are slightly larger and heavier than males. Geographic range M. viridis is found in Indonesia (Misool, Salawati, Aru Islands, Schouten Islands, most of Western New Guinea), Papua New Guinea (including nearby islands from sea level to 1,800 m elevation, Normanby Island and the d'Entrecasteaux Islands) and Australia (Queensland along the east coast of the Cape York Peninsula). The type locality given is \\"Aroe-eilanden\\" (Aru Islands, Indonesia).McDiarmid RW, Campbell JA, Tour√© T (1999). Snake Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, Volume 1. Washington, District of Columbia: Herpetologists' League. 511 pp. (series). (volume) This species is sympatric with M. spilota and the two often compete in the same ecological niche. Habitat The preferred natural habitat of M. viridis is in or near rainforest, and the species is primarily arboreal, residing in trees, shrubs, and bushes. Occasionally, it is seen on the ground. Conservation In 2010, the green tree python was rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of endangered species on the basis of its large range and isolated declines in population from smuggling. However, the threat from smuggling for the pet trade was recognised and requires monitoring. Behaviour Primarily arboreal, M. viridis has a particular way of resting in the branches of trees; it loops a coil or two over the branches in a saddle position and places its head in the middle. This trait is shared with the emerald tree boa (Corallus caninus) of South America. This habit, along with their similar appearance, has caused people to confuse the two species when seen outside their natural habitat. Diet The diet of M. viridis consists mostly of small mammals, such as rodents, and sometimes reptiles, such as geckos and skinks. This snake, like the emerald tree boa, was thought to eat birds; however, Switak conducted field work on this issue. In examining stomach contents of more than 1,000 animals, he did not find any evidence of avian prey. Prey is captured by holding onto a branch using the prehensile tail and striking out from an S-shaped position and constricting the prey. Wild specimens have also been observed and photographed wrapped around the base of small tree trunks, facing down in an ambush position, presumably waiting for ground mammals to prey upon. Reproduction Maroon M. viridis neonate M. viridis M. viridis is oviparous, laying one to 25 viable eggs per clutch. Breeding has never been reported from the wild, but in captivity, eggs are incubated and protected by the female. Hatchlings are lemon-yellow with broken stripes and spots of purple and brown, or golden or orange-red. For yellow individuals at Iron Range National Park, Australia, the color change occurred over 5‚Äì10 days when individuals were long, which corresponds to about a year old. Color change for red juveniles has not been observed in the wild. Captivity The green tree python is often bred and kept in captivity, although it is usually considered an advanced species due to its specific care requirements and generally irritable temperament. However, with proper care, it usually thrives in captivity. It is a popular species among reptile enthusiasts and breeders on account of its adult and juvenile colours. This has led to large numbers being illegally caught in the wild to the detriment of native populations. Transport is hazardous to the snakes' health and up to half are thought to perish in the smuggling process. The species is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. In 1999, it was fully protected under national legislation in Indonesia. Despite this, a flourishing illegal trade continues, and wildlife breeding farms were found to be serving as conduits to funnel wild-caught green tree pythons out of Indonesia. Investigation in the provinces of Maluku, West Papua, and Papua from 2009 to 2011 revealed that 80% of green tree pythons exported were caught in the wild, an estimate of around 5337 individuals a year. Harvesting of wild green tree pythons was heaviest in Biak and neighbouring islands, with resulting population decline.

Early life John Adrian Shepherd-Barron was born on 23 June 1925 at Shillong in India, to British parents. His Scottish father, Wilfred Shepherd-Barron, was chief engineer of the Chittagong Port Commissioners in North Bengal, which was then part of the British Empire, then later Chief Engineer of the Port of London Authority, before becoming president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, whilst his mother Dorothy, was an Olympic tennis player and Wimbledon ladies doubles champion.telegraph.co.uk ‚Äì John Shepherd-Barron Shepherd-Barron was educated at Stowe School, the University of Edinburgh and Trinity College, Cambridge (from where he dropped out before successfully finishing the first year in Economics). During World War II, he was commissioned into the Airborne Forces, serving with the 159th Parachute Light Regiment. Career The Enfield branch of Barclays Bank, site of the first cash machine Blue plaque on the Enfield Barclays commemorating the world's first cash machine Shepherd-Barron joined De La Rue in the 1950s as a management trainee and grew to become Managing Director of De La Rue Instruments (with a mandate to run down the company). He conceived the idea for a self-service machine dispensing cash whilst lying in the bath. He was considering the problem of bank opening hours, having turned up at a bank after closing time one day and found himself unable to withdraw money. Shepherd-Barron has stated that he was inspired by chocolate vending machines: \\"It struck me there must be a way I could get my own money, anywhere in the world or the UK. I hit upon the idea of a chocolate bar dispenser, but replacing chocolate with cash.\\"Interview with Shepherd-Barron, You and Yours BBC Radio 4 programme 25 June 2007 He pitched the idea to the head of Barclays Bank over a pink gin. The first De La Rue Automatic Cash System (DACS) machine, called Barclaycash, was installed outside the Enfield branch of Barclays Bank in north London in June 1967. The first person to withdraw cash was actor Reg Varney, a celebrity resident of Enfield known for his part in a number of popular television series. An early deployment of this device outside of the UK took place in Zurich on November, 1967. It was called The DACS machines used cheque-like tokens (which were guillotined to the size of a normal cheque inside the machine) which had been impregnated with a radioactive compound of carbon-14. The radioactive signal was detected by the machine and matched against the personal identification number (PIN) entered on a keypad. The short-range beta emission from carbon-14 could be easily detected, and he determined that the radiation hazard was acceptable as \\"you would have to eat 136,000 such cheques for it to have any effect on you\\". Initially, a PIN length of six digits was proposed; Shepherd-Barron tested this system on his wife, Caroline, but found that the longest string of numbers that she could remember was four. As a result, four-digit PINs were chosen and as ATMs expanded across the globe, this became the world standard. Withdrawals from the first Barclaycash machines were limited to a maximum of ¬£10, \\"quite enough for a wild weekend\\" according to Shepherd-Barron. Shepherd- Barron received the O.B.E. in the 2005 New Year's Honours list for services to banking as \\"inventor of the automatic cash dispenser\\". Various rival cash dispenser systems quickly began to emerge. Another Scottish inventor, James Goodfellow, who was working at Smiths Industries, was commissioned by Chubb Locks to work on a new cash machine. Together with Anthony Davies, he developed a new system whereby the user's PIN could be stored on a reusable bank card, rather than on single-use cheques. The system was patented as GB1197183 and US3905461 and was cited by subsequent patents as \\"prior art device\\". Goodfellow's PIN system resembled modern ATMs more than Shepherd- Barron's machine.Caledonian Mercury, 21 May 2010 However, Shepherd-Barron's machine was the first to be installed, if only for a few days. Personal life His son, Nicholas Shepherd-Barron FRS, is professor of algebraic geometry at the King's College London.

She was built at Bay City, Michigan, by the Defoe Boat and Motor Works company, was acquired by the Navy from H. J. Defoe in July 1917. Although listed in the 1918 edition of Ship's Data: U.S. Naval Vessels as being delivered and commissioned on 25 July 1917, Voyager's extant logs do not begin until on 1 September 1917. Nevertheless, they indicate that the first men actually reported on board for duty as early as on 13 July 1917, 12 days before the delivery/commissioning date given in the Ship's Data: U.S. Naval Vessels for 1918. Service history=U.S. Navy service Attached to the 9th, 10th, and 11th Naval District local patrol forces and based at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, for the duration of World War I, Voyager operated actively on the Great Lakes until winter ice stopped navigation. Her first recorded duty in September appears to have been standing off a navigable channel off Pipe Island, guarding the wreck of the U.S. Steel Corporation boat Mitchell, which was apparently blocking part of the channel. Voyager operated out of Sault Ste. Marie into mid-November 1917 before she shifted to Detroit, Michigan, in company with the old gunboat . She was subsequently placed out of service between 18 and 21 November, and was decommissioned \\"for the season\\" on the 23rd. She remained inactive until on 8 May 1918, when she was ordered to return to Sault Ste. Marie. Departing on that day, Voyager set out in company with Isla de Luzon, , , , and . Rough weather during the first night of the voyage forced Voyager to drag anchor and run aground, but she was pulled off soon thereafter. Her motor broke down on 11 May, however, necessitating the SP boat's being towed back to her home port of Sault Ste. Marie. Voyager operated out of that Michigan port through the armistice of World War I on 11 November 1918, and was decommissioned on 13 May 1919. Simultaneously struck from the Navy List, Voyager was turned over to the Treasury Department for use by the United States Coast Guard at Chicago, Illinois, on 15 September 1919. U.S. Coast Guard service Voyager operated out of Chicago until late in 1922, when she was shifted back to her former home port, Sault Ste. Marie. On 6 November 1923, the erstwhile patrol craft lost her name and became simply AB-18. Classified as a harbor patrol cutter, she served in that capacity into the late 1930s. After 1936, her name disappeared from Coast Guard ship registers. Was purchased privately in 1936, and operated as the fishing vessel Marley Grace on Lake Superior until 1944, when she was scrapped by her owner.

The work reached its final form in a five-chapter text written by an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553, the second chapter of which is a list of books of Scripture presented as having been made Canonical by a Council of Rome under Pope Damasus I, bishop of Rome 366‚Äì383. This list, known as the Damasine List, Burkitt. represents the same canon as shown in the Council of Carthage Canon 24, 419 AD. Content The Decretum has five parts. Parts 1, 3, and 4 are not relevant to the canon. The second part is a canon catalogue. The Deuterocanonical Books (other than Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah) are accepted by the catalogue, and are still found in the Roman Catholic Bible, though not in the Protestant canon. The canon catalogue gives 27 books of the New Testament. In the list of gospels, the order is given as Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. Fourteen epistles are credited to Paul including Philemon and Hebrews. Of the General Epistles seven are accepted: two of Peter, one of James, one of the apostle John, two of \\"the other John the elder\\" (presbyter), and one of \\"Judas the Zealot\\". Decretum Gelasianum. The fifth part is a catalogue of the \\"apocryphal books\\" and other writings which are to be rejected, presented as adjudged apocryphal \\"by Pope Gelasius and seventy most erudite bishops\\". Though the ascription is generally agreed to be apocryphal itself, except among the most traditional of apologists, it perhaps makes allusion to the seventy translators of the Septuagint and the seventy apostles sent out in Luke. This list de libris recipiendis et non recipiendis (\\"of books to be admitted and not to be admitted\\"), probably originating in the 6th century, represents a tradition that can be traced back to Pope Damasus I and reflects Roman practice in the development of the Biblical canon. These apocrypha are not the same as the Deuterocanonical Books, but include the Acts of Andrew and other spurious works. Textual history The complete text is preserved in the mid-eighth-century Ragyndrudis Codex, fols. 57r-61v, which is the earliest manuscript copy containing the complete text. The earliest manuscript copy was produced c. 700, Brussels 9850-2. Versions of the work appear in multiple surviving manuscripts, some of which are titled as a Decretal of Pope Gelasius, others as a work of a Roman Council under the earlier Pope Damasus. However, all versions show signs of being derived from the full five-part text, which contains a quotation from Augustine, writing about 416 after Damasus, which is evidence for the document being later than that.

As the Union Army of the Potomac retreated southeast toward the James River, its rearguard under Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin stopped Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's divisions at the White Oak Bridge crossing, resulting in an artillery duel, while the main Battle of Glendale raged two miles (3 km) farther south around Frayser's Farm. White Oak Swamp is generally considered to be part of the larger Glendale engagement. Because of this resistance from Brig. Gen. William B. Franklin's VI Corps, Jackson was prevented from joining the consolidated assault on the Union Army at Glendale that had been ordered by General Robert E. Lee, producing an inconclusive result, but one in which the Union Army avoided destruction and was able to assume a strong defensive position at Malvern Hill. Background= Military situation  The Seven Days Battles began with a Union attack in the minor Battle of Oak Grove on June 25, 1862, but McClellan quickly lost the initiative as Lee began a series of attacks at Beaver Dam Creek on June 26, Gaines's Mill on June 27, the minor actions at Garnett's and Golding's Farm on June 27 and June 28, and the attack on the Union rear guard at Savage's Station on June 29. McClellan's Army of the Potomac continued its retreat toward the safety of Harrison's Landing on the James River.Salmon, p. 64. Most elements of McClellan's army had been able to cross White Oak Swamp Creek by noon on June 30. About one third of the army had reached the James River, but the remainder was still marching between White Oak Swamp and Glendale.Eicher, pp. 290-91; Kennedy, p. 98; Salmon, p. 113. Lee ordered his Army of Northern Virginia to converge on the retreating Union forces, bottlenecked on the inadequate road network. Stonewall Jackson was ordered to press the Union rear guard at the White Oak Swamp crossing while the largest part of Lee's army, some 45,000 men, would attack the Army of the Potomac in mid-retreat at Glendale, about southwest, splitting it in two.Eicher, p. 291; Salmon, pp. 113-15. Stonewall Jackson had acquired fame for his brilliant campaign in the Shenandoah Valley, but had performed poorly so far under Lee's command in the Seven Days.See, for instance, Freeman, R.E. Lee, vol. 2, p. 247: \\"... by every test, Jackson had failed throughout the Seven Days.\\" Perhaps too fatigued from his campaign and travel from the Valley, he arrived late at Mechanicsville (Beaver Dam Creek) and inexplicably ordered his men to bivouac for the night within clear earshot of the battle. He was late and disoriented at Gaines's Mill. He was late again at Savage's Station.Salmon, pp. 64-65. The upcoming action in support of Lee's assault at Glendale would offer him another opportunity. Jackson and Lee met privately on the morning of June 30 at Savage's Station and Lee's exact orders were not recorded, but they apparently were for Jackson to march to White Oak Swamp and engage the Union forces there to prevent them from reinforcing the remainder of the rear guard at Glendale.Salmon, p. 117. The last Union unit to travel south through White Oak Swamp, and thus Jackson's target, was the VI Corps under Brig. Gen. William B. Franklin, consisting of the divisions of Brig. Gens. William F. \\"Baldy\\" Smith and Israel B. Richardson. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle Seven Days Battles, June 30, 1862 Jackson's men marched south on the White Oak Road with their artillery chief, Colonel Stapleton Crutchfield, at the head of the column. They marched slowly because they were accompanied by thousands of wounded Union prisoners and many of the stores that they obtained at Savage's Station. They found that the single bridge over the swamp had been burned two hours earlier. Jackson arrived at noon and approved Crutchfield's gun emplacement that was designed to fire diagonally from a ridge across the swamp against the Union batteries and infantry positions that they saw about away. At 2 p.m. on June 30, seven Confederate batteries of 31 guns opened fire, catching the Union troops by surprise and disabling several of their cannons.Robertson, p. 493; Salmon, p. 117. After ordering his engineers to begin rebuilding the bridge, Jackson directed Col. Thomas T. Munford's 2nd Virginia Cavalry to cross the swamp and capture some of the Union guns abandoned during the bombardment. As the men and horses waded through water that was belly deep and fouled with debris, Jackson and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill crossed the river to perform a personal reconnaissance. A Union artillery shell exploded only a few feet away from the generals mounted on horseback, although neither was injured. Jackson saw that Union artillery and infantry was reinforcing the position, and that Federal sharpshooters would play havoc with his engineers on the bridge. He realized that this was not a place that he could make an opposed crossing.Robertson, p. 494; Salmon, p. 117. Munford reported that he found a ford (Fisher's Ford) a quarter of a mile downstream that would be suitable for the infantry to cross. Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton found a closer point at which a simple bridge could be built for infantry. Jackson ordered him to build the bridge, but took no specific action to cross the swamp, having decided that it was infeasible to attack if he could not cross his artillery. While the artillery duel across the swamp escalated to over 40 guns, and while the battle at Glendale raged less than away, Jackson sat beneath a large oak tree and fell asleep for over an hour.Robertson, pp. 494-95; Salmon, pp. 117-19. Aftermath Jackson's inaction allowed some units to be detached from Franklin's corps in late afternoon to reinforce the Union troops at Glendale. Jackson did not inform Lee of his situation and Lee did not send anyone to find Jackson until it was too late to make a difference. Although Jackson's wing of the Army and Franklin's corps comprised tens of thousands of men, the action at White Oak Swamp included no infantry activity and was limited to primarily an artillery duel. The Confederates lost 3 artillerymen killed and 12 wounded, but there is no exact record of the number of Union casualties; historian Brian K. Burton estimates as many as 100 Union casualties, with the highest losses in the 5th New Hampshire, which had 5 men killed and 9 wounded. After dinner with his staff that night, Jackson fell asleep again, with a biscuit clenched between his teeth. Upon awakening he announced, \\"Now, gentlemen, let us at once to bed, and rise with the dawn, and see if tomorrow we can do something.\\" Two weeks later he offered an explanation for his unusually lethargic conduct at the battle: \\"If General Lee had wanted me, he could have sent for me.\\"Robertson, pp. 495-96. Lee never criticized Jackson's performance in the battle.Sears, p. 278. Edward Porter Alexander, the prominent Confederate artillery commander and postwar historian, lamented about the great lost opportunity at Glendale and White Oak Swamp: \\"When one thinks of the great chances in General Lee's grasp that one summer afternoon, it is enough to make one cry ... to think that our Stonewall Jackson lost them.\\"Robertson, p. 496.

It is inherently tied to consumer interests where celebrities transform their fame to become product brands. Whereas a culture can usually be physically identified, and its group characteristics easily observed, celebrity culture exists solely as a collection of individuals' desires for increased celebrity viewing. Celebrities themselves do not form a cohesive and identifiable group with which they identify themselves, but are rather found across a spectrum of activities and communities including acting, politics, fashion, sports and music. The \\"culture\\" is created when it is common knowledge within a society that people are interested in celebrities and are willing to alter their own lives to take part in celebrities' lives. The \\"culture\\" is first defined by factors outside of celebrities themselves, and then augmented by celebrities' involvement within that publicly constructed culture. Celebrity culture has become a part of everyday society and functions as a form of entertainment. Today, everyday citizens play an important role in the perpetuation of celebrity culture by constantly checking the whereabouts of celebrities, the trends within celebrity culture, and the general lives of celebrity via media. Celebrity culture is now reflected in social norms and values because of the extreme citizen involvement. Today, as it is now used as entertainment, celebrity culture is viewed as a form of \\"escapism\\" from reality and a means of preoccupation for everyday people. Promotion from celebrities There have been multiple phases in the popularity of celebrity culture. The earliest examples would include the broadcasting of television programs where human beings could reach wider audiences and individuals could be given rise to fame. As different technologies were released, the manipulation of audiences changed, and the reaches of celebrity culture has greatly expanded. Entrepreneurial individuals began to recognize the financial value in purposefully promoting certain individuals, and thus a consumer approach to celebrities as brands emerged. A culture began to take shape as consumers accepted celebrities as a part of society. This acceptance along with shrewd marketing perpetuates celebrity culture with its constantly shifting customs and beliefs. Celebrity culture can be viewed as synonymous with celebrity industry, where celebrities are treated as products to be sold. Celebrity culture differs from consumer culture in that celebrity culture is a single aspect of consumer culture. Celebrity culture could not exist without consumer culture, as people are consistently buying magazines, apps for celebrities, and other celebrity- related merchandise. Consumers' choices are thus influenced by celebrities' choices. By following celebrities, consumers are invited to take part in the collective society created by the existence of celebrity culture, unknowingly perpetuated by the consumers themselves. Participants of the celebrity culture phenomenon also include the celebrities themselves, being aware they can brand themselves and achieve financial gains through their own fame and status, apart from the foundation of their celebrity pre-branding. \\"To people who have grown tired of self-government, the belief in kings and queens and fairy tales seems easier and more comfortable than the practice of politics,\\" wrote Lewis Lapham in his book, The Wish For Kings. This notion is the basis for the naturally occurring relationship between \\"regular\\" men and women, and those on a pedestal. The famous religious books of the world's faiths are replete with examples of individuals who are well known by the general public. Some of the pharaohs of ancient Egypt set in motion devices to ensure their own fame for centuries to come. Celebrity culture, once restricted to royalty and biblical/mythical figures, has pervaded many sectors of society including business, publishing, and even academia (the scilebrities). With every scientific advance names have become attached to discoveries. Especially for large contributions to humanity, the contributor is usually regarded honourably. Mass media has increased the exposure and power of celebrity. A trend has developed that celebrity carries with it increasingly more social capital than in earlier times. Each nation or cultural community (linguistic, ethnic, religious) has its own independent celebrity system, but this is becoming less the case due to globalization (see J-pop or K-pop).  Perpetuation of celebrity culture  According to Oliver Dreissens, celebrity‚Äôs social and cultural prominence can be traced back to the success of the mass media.Driessens, Olivier. ‚ÄúThe Celebritization of Society and Culture: Understanding the Structural Dynamics of Celebrity Culture.‚Äù International Journal of Cultural Studies, vol. 16, no. 6, 2013, pp. 641‚Äì657., doi:10.1177/1367877912459140. Accessed 23 Feb. 2018. The various forms of mass media allowed for the spread of new images and branding of celebrities. Especially with the inclusion of televisions in the average home, there became more of a familiarity with the people or celebrities now \\"in our homes\\".Marshall, P. D. Celebrity and Power: Fame in Contemporary Culture. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis;London;, 2014, doi:10.5749/j.ctt7zw6qj. Media surrounding celebrities has heavily influenced not only celebrity culture but the general social environment in our lives.Lundby K (ed.) (2009) Mediatization: Concept, Changes, Consequences. New York: Peter Lang Celebrities are known to not only influence what we buy but many other things such as body image, career aspirations and politics. Richard Dyer has stated that celebrity culture is bound up with the condition of global capitalism in which \\"individuals are seen to determine society\\".Barry, E. (2008). Celebrity, cultural production and public life. International Journal of Cultural Studies, 11(3), 251-258. doi:10.1177/1367877908092583 Newer technologies, such as cable television and 24/7 coverage, have made today‚Äôs celebrities manufactured for mass consumption, as opposed to the celebrities of the thirties and the fifties who were more self-made.Furedi, F. Soc (2010) \\"Celebrity Culture\\" 47: 493. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12115-010-9367-6 24/7 coverage pushed for more programming and people to fill the extra time. With this evolved more shows and celebrities who partook in the additional screen time. Reality television has been a large part of fostering a new celebrity culture that is more interchangeable and recognizable. Cable television and social media sites such as YouTube, have made ‚Äúovernight‚Äù sensations which have perpetuated today's perception of celebrity culture. Celebrities such as Justin Bieber, who rose to immense fame after being discovered on YouTube, are argued to elicit emotional ties and self-reflexiveness that invoke a seemingly personal connection. This can be seen with some fans, especially female fans, feeling like they have a certain ownership or connection over a celebrity.Fox, S. \\"Spectacular Girls: Media Fascination & Celebrity Culture.\\" Womens Studies-an Interdisciplinary Journal, vol. 44, no. 4, 2015, pp. 577-577.  Celebrity and political culture  Celebrities and politics have interacted in mainly one of two ways. The first way is celebrity politicians, which crosses an elected office of government with celebritization. The second way is with political activism, a newly popular method which avoids directly participating in government itself.  Celebrity politicians  Celebrity politicians can be divided into two categories: celebrities that go over to government and hold an elected office and politicians that become celebrities. Celebrities that have held a government office are not uncommon. Donald Trump is an example of one. A businessman and real estate dealer who has licensed his name to properties and other brands, Trump gained national fame when he starred in the television show The Apprentice in 2004, and again during the 2012 presidential election by implying that then presidential candidate Barack Obama was not a natural born United States citizen. He then successfully ran for the United States presidency in 2016. Ronald Reagan is another example. He was a career actor that appeared in 53 films over two decades. He first became governor of California in 1966, and then became president of the United States in 1980. Politicians have also become celebrities themselves, either naturally or by copying celebrity traits. The Democratic group \\"The Squad\\" is an example. Consisting of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Talib, they are four Democrat representatives that first formed after the 2018 midterm elections, when Ocasio-Cortez posted a picture of the four seated together on Instagram, playing off of the colloquial term 'squad goals.' They have become well known for their outspoken nature in social media and their clashes against other politicians, such as Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi.Katy Perry and Hillary Clinton at the I'm With Her concert, which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential Race There has recently been an intersection of celebrity and political culture. This is a result of the large platform given to celebrities; as Jane Johnson, a reporter for the popular British celebrity publication Closer observed, the gossip surrounding celebrities is a nationally unifying factor among all social groups. This unification and large platform provided by celebrities has been a point of interest for political leaders and groups to gain farther reach within various campaigns. Young adults have had historically lower voter turnout than any other voting age group. Knowing this, politicians and public figures draw from the cultural resources curated by celebrities by mimicking the popular, accessible public persona given off by today's celebrities. As noted by author Frank Furedi, ‚ÄúPoliticians self consciously attempt to either acquire a celebrity image or to associate themselves with individuals who possess this status‚Äù. This can be seen with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who has become somewhat of a celebrity because of the perception of being personable and supporting progressive, liberal policies. Another example of this was Katy Perry campaigning and performing for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Presidential election.  Celebrities and political issues  Celebrities have used their actions to highlight political issues. Jane Fonda has tried to promote awareness of climate change through being arrested for civil disobedience. With the rise of social media, celebrities have been able to express their opinions on controversial topics to get immediate feedback from their fans. Some celebrities have endorsed political candidates, such as Dave Chappelle endorsing 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Some celebrities chose to refrain from using their status in this way. Michael Jordan allegedly said, \\"Republicans buy sneakers, too.\\" when turning down a politician looking for an endorsement. Today Celebrity status is widely sought by many people. Celebrities are often displeased by their status. Paparazzi are a problem for celebrities. Another problem is celebrity marriage. There is research that suggests child celebrities have poor emotional health in adulthood, and often turn to drug abuse. Celebrity status is ranked by an \\"A-list\\" or \\"B-list\\" hierarchy. Sometimes people who achieved celebrity status come to regret it, e.g. Bart Spring in 't Veld, who came to loathe the reality TV celebrity culture which Big Brother, of which he was the first winner in the world, instigated. Celebrity gossip Celebrity gossip has become an integral part of American culture, acting as not only a form of entertainment, but a form of social involvement and social order. Gossip allows people to connect and interact with one another, providing a sense of community within society. Through gossip, people are able to affirm their values and ideas by hearing about celebrity struggle via tabloids and other forms of media. The information given to people to consume and discuss allows for civic engagement on a global scale as there is material to talk about with others that is generally known through gossip. Vehicles In the US, celebrity culture is created and disseminated by television talk shows such as Entertainment Tonight, where actors and music stars promote their latest films and albums, and by many celebrity magazines such as People, Us, and Star. Another phenomenon is the arrival and rise of \\"micro-celebrities\\" through the WWW (internet celebrities). Social media Celebrity culture is a constantly changing topic that grows as technology does. Different platforms are being implemented: Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook, all of which provide a new outlet for celebrities to express their thoughts. Twitter is constantly changing celebrity views and provides an unmonitored space for opinions to be shared. It provides a platform for celebrities to re-share ideas and safely share theirs. It also allows for people to comment, making it engaging to fans and followers. Instagram is also growing and continues to be a popular outlet for celebrities, as it provides an outlet for purely pictures. Many of these pictures also include other people who are famous, boosting their image and reaching to different fan bases. Lastly, Facebook is still a common used platform that many celebrities use, especially older demographics. Many older generation prefer Facebook because it is easy to navigate and people can share and write posts that are of importance to them. Twitter Twitter allowed higher frequency of interaction with people, thus increasing intimacy and the perception of culture. Twitter users could now directly interact with celebrities with the expectation of a public response. Instagram Through Instagram's unique format another layer of celebrity culture was added, allowing celebrities to further their intimacy with followers by sharing selected photos and videos with their audience. With each additional platform a celebrity uses to promote themselves, a wider view is created thus enhancing the perception of culture. Instagram also recently changed the layout to try to help celebrities become more noticed. They use an algorithm that determines what pictures are at the top of a person's feed and what pictures are at the bottom and are harder to find. Trends of celebrities found on Instagram have a massive cultural impact as the platform allows for people to see and imitate a celebrities via clothing, speech, or humor allowing them to indirectly engage with celebrity culture. Today, Instagram can be used as a platform for marketing as celebrities can be paid huge sums of money for product placement or usage in their posts. YouTube Recently, YouTube has also become a large part of the growth of social media. On this site, there are YouTube influencers that have become to be a new group of celebrities. These influencers may post videos about their daily life in vlogs, beauty, playing videogames, and many other genres. They have become so popular in recent years because viewers see them as more relatable than movie stars or other groups of celebrities. Since they are exposed to very personal videos, fans are able to from a strong bond with these influencers. Tantrums Some celebrities are known for \\"throwing tantrums\\" to get their way. They are also known for getting in debates with their friends, who are also celebrities, in order to amp up the drama and let their names be seen. When an individual is in the public eye, it changes how they act and their behavior. Usually it encourages people to act in extremes, whether that be extremely good or extremely bad. Most of the time, publicity only goes to celebrities who are going against the social norm, and doing something different. People are more interested in reading about something crazy a celebrity did, rather than them going out and having a respectful lunch. Complaints A common complaint of modern celebrity culture is that the public, instead of seeking virtues or talents in celebrities, seek those who are the most willing to break ethical boundaries, or those who are most aggressive in self-promotion. In other words, infamy has replaced fame. The social role of the town drunk, the court jester, or the sexually indiscreet are not new, but arguably, the glorification of these individuals is. Society selects celebrities that provide the most entertainment and news stories as the most notorious. Explanations One possible explanation of this trend is that an artificial importance has been created in order to promote a product or a service, rather than to record a purely biographical event. As more new products are launched in a world market that is constantly expanding, the need for more celebrities has become an industry in itself. Another explanation, used by Chuck Palahniuk, is that this exaggeration of modern celebrity culture is created out of a need for drama and spectacle. In the book Haunted, he describes the pattern of creating a celebrity as a god-like figure, and once this image is created, the desire to destroy it and shame the individual in the most extreme ways possible. Tabloid magazines are the prototype example of this theory. Posthumous fame Some creators such as poets, artists, musicians, and inventors are little-known and little-appreciated during their lives but are feted as brilliant innovators after their deaths. In some cases, after historians uncover a creator's role in the development of some type of cultural or technical process, the contributions of these little-known individuals become more widely known. A desire to achieve this type of posthumous fame may have motivated Alan Abel, Adam Rich and Pauly Shore to stage their own deaths. Sometimes a false death mention can cause a person to rethink their legacy. Alfred Nobel founded the Nobel Prizes after an erroneous obituary labelled him a \\"merchant of death\\" due to his invention and selling of dynamite. People who were far more famous after their deaths than during their lifetime (and often were completely or relatively unknown) include painter Bob Ross; Greek philosopher Socrates; scientist Galileo Galilei; 1800s-era poet John Keats; painter Vincent van Gogh; poet and novelist Edgar Allan Poe; singer Eva Cassidy; comedian Bill Hicks; writer Emily Dickinson; artist Edith Holden, whose 1906 diary was a best-seller when published posthumously in 1977; writer Franz Kafka; singer Jeff Buckley; diarist Anne Frank; philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard; writer John Kennedy Toole (who posthumously won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction 12 years after his death); author Stieg Larsson (who died with his Millennium novels unpublished); musician, artist and poet Rozz Williams; and William Webb Ellis, the alleged inventor of Rugby football. Herostratus, a young Greek man arsoned the Temple of Artemis (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World) in 356 BC in order to immortalize his name. Although authorities at the time tried to expunge him from history and punished people with the death penalty for even merely mentioning his name, he succeeded in achieving lasting fame, as his name is well known to this day.

The dart will remove a small piece of the whale's skin and bounce harmlessly off the animal. Cetology (from Greek , kƒìtos, \\"whale\\"; and , -logia) or whalelore (also known as whaleology) is the branch of marine mammal science that studies the approximately eighty species of whales, dolphins, and porpoise in the scientific order Cetacea. Cetologists, or those who practice cetology, seek to understand and explain cetacean evolution, distribution, morphology, behavior, community dynamics, and other topics. History Bottlenose dolphin Observations about Cetacea have been recorded since at least classical times. Ancient Greek fishermen created an artificial notch on the dorsal fin of dolphins entangled in nets so that they could tell them apart years later. Approximately 2,300 years ago, Aristotle carefully took notes on cetaceans while traveling on boats with fishermen in the Aegean Sea. In his book Historia animalium (History of Animals), Aristotle was careful enough to distinguish between the baleen whales and toothed whales, a taxonomical separation still used today. He also described the sperm whale and the common dolphin, stating that they can live for at least twenty-five or thirty years. His achievement was remarkable for its time, because even today it is very difficult to estimate the life-span of advanced marine animals. After Aristotle's death, much of the knowledge he had gained about cetaceans was lost, only to be re-discovered during the Renaissance. Many of the medieval texts on cetaceans come mainly from Scandinavia and Iceland, most came about the mid-13th century. One of the better known is Speculum Regale. In this text is described various species that lived around the island of Iceland. It mentions orcs that had dog-like teeth and would demonstrate the same kind of aggression towards other cetaceans as wild dogs would to other terrestrial animals. The text even illustrated the hunting technique of orcs, which are now called orcas. The Speculum Regale describes other cetaceans, including the sperm whale and narwhal. Many times they were seen as terrible monsters, such as killers of men, and destroyers of ships. They even bore odd names such as \\"pig whale\\", \\"horse whale\\", and \\"red whale\\". But not all creatures described were said to be fierce. Some were seen to be good, such as whales that drove shoals of herring towards the shore. This was seen as very helpful to fisherman. Many of the early studies were based on dead specimens and myth. The little information that was gathered was usually length, and a rough outer body anatomy. Because these animals live in water their entire lives, early scientists did not have the technology to go study these animals further. It was not until the 16th century that things would begin to change. Then cetaceans would be proved to be mammals rather than fish. Aristotle argued they were mammals. But Pliny the Elder stated that they were fish, and it was followed by many naturalists. However, Pierre Belon (1517‚Äì1575) and G. Rondelet (1507‚Äì1566) persisted on convincing they were mammals. They argued that the animals had lungs and a uterus, just like mammals. Not until 1758, when Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707‚Äì1778) published the tenth edition of Systema Naturae, were they seen as mammals. Only decades later, French zoologist and paleontologist Baron Georges Cuvier (1769‚Äì1832) described the animals as mammals without any hind legs. Skeletons were assembled and displayed in the first natural history museums, and on a closer look and comparisons with other extinct animal fossils led zoologists to conclude that cetaceans came from a family of ancient land mammals. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, much of our information on cetaceans came from whalers. Whalers were the most knowledgeable about the animals, but their information was regarding migration routes and outer anatomy, and only little information of behavior. During the 1960s, people began studying the animals intensively, often in dedicated research institutes. The Tethys Institute of Milan, founded in 1986, compiled an extensive cetology database of the Mediterranean. This came from both concern about wild populations and also the capture of larger animals such as the orca, and gaining popularity of dolphin shows in marine parks.  Studying cetaceans Humpback whales often have distinct markings that enable scientists to identify individuals. Studying cetaceans presents numerous challenges. Cetaceans only spend 10% of their time on the surface, and all they do at the surface is breathe. There is very little behavior seen at the surface. It is also impossible to find any signs that an animal has been in an area. Cetaceans do not leave tracks that can be followed. However, the dung of whales often floats and can be collected to tell important information about their diet and about the role they have in the environment.Lavery, T.J. et al. 2010. Iron defecation by sperm whales stimulates carbon export in the Southern Ocean. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B. 277: 3527-3531 Many times cetology consists of waiting and paying close attention. Cetologists use equipment including hydrophones to listen to calls of communicating animals, binoculars and other optical devices for scanning the horizon, cameras, notes, and a few other devices and tools. An alternative method of studying cetaceans is through examination of dead carcasses that wash up on the shore. If properly collected and stored, these carcasses can provide important information that is difficult to obtain in field studies.Lavery, T.J., Butterfield, N., Kemper, C.M., Reid, R.J., Sanderson, K: (2008). Metals and selenium in the liver and bone of three dolphin species from South Australia. Science of the Total Environment 390(1): 77‚Äì85 Identifying individuals In recent decades, methods of identifying individual cetaceans have enabled accurate population counts and insights into the life cycles and social structures of various species. One such successful system is photo-identification. This system was popularized by Michael Bigg, a pioneer in modern orca (killer whale) research. During the mid-1970s, Bigg and Graeme Ellis photographed local orcas in the British Columbian seas. After examining the photos, they realized they could recognize certain individual whales by looking at the shape and condition of the dorsal fin, and also the shape of the saddle patch. These are as unique as a human fingerprint; no one animal's looks is exactly like another's. After they could recognize certain individuals, they found that the animals travel in stable groups called pods. Researchers use photo identification to identify specific individuals and pods. The photographic system has also worked well in humpback whale studies. Researchers use the color of the pectoral fins and color and scarring of the fluke to identify individuals. Scars from orca attacks found on the flukes of humpbacks are also used in identification.

He is best known for his design work with the Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co. Ltd. in the early 20th century, including the F-5 model mandolin and L-5 guitar. In his later years he worked on electric amplification of stringed instruments, and demonstrated them around the country. One example, played in public in 1938 was an electric viola that used electric coils beneath the bridge, with no back, able to \\"drown out the loudest trumpet.\\" In 1898 Orville Gibson had patented a new kind of mandolin that followed violin design, with its curved top and bottom carved into shape, rather than pressed. The sides too were carved out of a single block of wood, rather than being made of bent wood strips. The instruments were already unique before Lloyd Loar came to work for Gibson. However, it is the Loar- designed instruments that became especially desirable. First made famous by Bill Monroe, Loar's signed mandolins today can cost as much as 200,000 dollars. The L-5 guitar owned by Maybelle Carter, which was made after he left Gibson, sold for 575,000 dollars. Among the changes that Loar introduced was the f-hole instead of a round or oval sound-hole, another violin-family feature imported to the mandolin. He also \\"tuned\\" the tops of the instrument and the sound chamber (by removing bits of wood from sound bars and from the edges of the sound holes) so that the instrument's sound chamber was resonant to a particular note. Another change that Loar introduced to the Gibson line was a tone-producer, a circle of wood inside the instrument on the underside of the sound board that produced \\"overtones.\\" His idea was to have a more complete set of these overtones with the carved top instruments. The result was an instrument that, like Stradivarius‚Äô violins, has presented challenges to duplicate. Luthier-researchers such as Roger Siminoff have worked to understand the fine details. Gibsons' and Loar's mandolins were instrumental in displacing the round-backed instrument from the American market and influenced mandolins worldwide. He also developed keyboard-stringed instruments. According to Roger Siminoff, he developed unique mechanisms to create sound. One plucked strings, the other struck metal reeds. Loar was also a well-regarded musician on mandolin, viola, and musical saw. He traveled the United States and Europe in several musical groups. In one group, he performed with his future wife, Fisher Shipp. A surviving playbill shows that Loar performed in a chatauqua that also included a speech by William Jennings Bryan. Loar performed in many other groups that promoted the Gibson company, whose products Loar endorses in early Gibson catalogs. Lloyd also taught at Northwestern University from 1930 to 1943, teaching vocal composition, advanced music theory and \\"The Physics of Music\\".  History  Loar worked for Gibson from 1919 to 1924. His contributions include building the instrument top with F-shaped holes, like a violin; introducing a longer neck, thus moving the bridge closer to the center of the body; and floating the fingerboard over the top, a change from prior Gibson instruments that had fingerboards fused to the top. He also pioneered the use of the Virzi Tone Producer, a spruce disc suspended from the instrument top that acts as a supplemental soundboard. According to A. R. Duchossoir, Loar designed experimental electric instruments while at Gibson. Loar's views on the importance of the development of electric instruments were supported by Lewis A Williams, one of the founders and major stockholders of Gibson as well as its secretary and general manager. None of Loar's original electric instruments appear to have been preserved‚Äîbut Walter A Fuller, who joined Gibson in 1933 and later became Gibson's chief electronic engineer, found some of Loar's original devices when he first set up his R&D; lab in the mid-1930s. He claimed that Loar's electrics had electrostatic pickups, but because they exhibited very high impedance they were extremely susceptible to humidity. According to Fuller, the pickups were round, about the size of a silver dollar and had a piece of cork on the back, by which they were glued to the underside of the top of the instrument. Duchossoir's book, Gibson Electrics, The Classic Years, features a photo of a Gibson L5, serial number 88258 of 1929 (after Loar left Gibson), one of the original Loar-designed L5s, with fitted electrostatic pickup and factory-fitted jack socket in the tailpiece. Duchossoir also claims that Loar spent time at Gibson working on a 'quasi- solid body' electric double bass, and that according to this instrument and several patents filed by Loar between the mid-1920s and the mid-1930s, he worked on pickups that were electromagnetic in nature. According to Duchossoir, Lewis Williams was replaced as general manager, and a lack of amicable relations with the new manager‚Äîan accountant named Guy Hart‚Äîled to the termination of Loar's contract. After leaving Gibson, Loar created and patented an electric instrument with a coil pickup, and co-founded the Acousti-Lectric company with Lewis Williams in 1934. The company was renamed the Vivi-Tone company in 1936. Loar died in 1943.  Famous Loar mandolins  The F5 model was made famous by the founder of bluegrass, Bill Monroe. Monroe played a Gibson F5 model serial number 73987 signed by Loar on July 9, 1923 for most of his career. This mandolin can be viewed in the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee, where it now resides in their collections. Loar also signed a rare subset of F5 mandolins called Ferns, of which approximately twenty are known to exist. The name refers to the distinctive fern inlay design of the peghead. The earliest documented Fern bears the serial number 73755, dated July 9, 1923, the same signing date as Bill Monroe's famous Loar . This is the only known Fern built without the \\"Virzi\\" Tone Producer, a secondary sound board suspended underneath the mandolin's top inside the sound chamber. This particular instrument is the only known Fern dated on 9 July. In 2007, mandolinist Chris Thile acquired 1924 Loar-signed F5 serial # 75316 that was an exceedingly rare find, as it was in virtually new condition. It reportedly cost him around $200,000. Other well-known musicians who have owned Loar-signed F5's include John Paul Jones serial # 75317, Mike Marshall, David McLaughlin, Herschel Sizemore, Alan Bibey, Tony Williamson, David Grisman, John Reischman, Tom Rozum, Frank Wakefield, and the late Joe Val serial #72207. Only one A-style mandolin, a Gibson A5, is known to have been signed by Loar. It has been widely copied, originally by mandolin maker Bob Givens. The Loar A5 was found by Tut Taylor and sold to a Southern California bluegrass musician in 1974. Mr. Taylor originally acquired the A5 from the sister of Dr. William B. Griffith, of the Griffith School of Music in Atlanta, Georgia. Dr. Griffith's wife, also a teacher at the school, reportedly requested an F5 in a body style without points. Her request resulted in the production of the Loar A5 in 1923.  Collectability  As of January 2010, Loar-signed mandolins in fine condition are valued in the $175,000 to $200,000 range, and are highly sought after by musicians and collectors. The average value reached a 2008 peak of around $225,000, then backed off somewhat from 2008 to 2010. Loar expert Darryl Wolfe maintains an F5 historical journal. As of January, 2010 he has documented 228 Loar-signed F5 mandolins of the 326 that are believed to have been made. L-5 Guitar The Gibson L-5 guitar was first produced in 1922 by the Gibson Guitar Corporation, then of Kalamazoo, Michigan, under the direction of master luthier Lloyd Loar, and has been in production ever since. It was considered the premier guitar of the company during the big band era. It was originally offered as an acoustic instrument, with electric models not made available until the 1940s. Design and construction Worldwide, the L-5 was the first guitar to feature f-holes. Then as well as today, the construction of the L-5 is similar in construction, carving, bracing and tap-tuning, to building a cello. This guitar as well as the cello are similarly designed in order to amplify and project the acoustic vibration of strings throughout carved and tuned woods, using f-holes as the projection points. From 1922 to 1934 the L-5 was produced with a 16\\" lower bout width. In 1934 the lower bout was increased to 17\\" - and this width is still used today. Also released in 1934 was the one-inch larger 18\\" archtop guitar named the \\"L5 Super\\" which a couple of years later was renamed the Gibson Super 400. These two master-built acoustic guitars are Gibson's top-of-the-line carved wood and highly ornate archtop instruments. These guitars cannot be constructed quickly and require unusual attention to detail, resulting in a higher price.

Established in 1906 by Jewish painter and sculptor Boris Schatz, Bezalel is Israel's oldest institution of higher education. It is named for the Biblical figure Bezalel, son of Uri (), who was appointed by Moses to oversee the design and construction of the Tabernacle (Exodus 35:30). The art created by Bezalel's students and professors in the early 1900s is considered the springboard for Israeli visual arts in the 20th century. Bezalel is currently located at the Mount Scopus campus of Hebrew University of Jerusalem, with the exception of the Architecture department, which is housed in the historic Bezalel building in downtown Jerusalem. In 2009 it was announced that Bezalel will be relocated to a new campus in the Russian Compound, as part of a municipal plan to revive Jerusalem's downtown. The new Bezalel campus is planned by the Tokyo-based award-winning architectural firm SANAA. History Boris Schatz, founder of Bezalel Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, professor of Hebrew at Bezalel Boris Schatz outside the Bezalel campus, Jerusalem, 1913 Bezalel drawing class under direction of Abel Pann, 1912 The Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts was founded in 1906 by Boris Schatz, who envisaged the creation of a national style of art blending classical Jewish/Middle Eastern and European traditions. The school opened in rented premises on Ethiopia Street. It moved to a complex of buildings constructed in the 1880s surrounded by a crenelated stone wall, owned by a wealthy Arab. In 1907, the property was purchased for Boris Schatz by the Jewish National Fund. Schatz lived on the campus with his wife and children. Bezalel's first class consisted of 30 young art students from Europe who successfully passed the entrance exam. Eliezer Ben Yehuda was hired to teach Hebrew to the students, who hailed from various countries and had no common language. His wife, Hemda Ben-Yehuda, worked as Boris Schatz's secretary. In addition to traditional sculpture and painting, the school offered workshops that produced decorative art objects in silver, leather, wood, brass, and fabric. Many of the craftsmen were Yemenite Jewish silversmiths who had a long tradition of working in precious metals, as silver- and goldsmithing, which had been traditional Jewish occupations in Yemen. Yemenite immigrants were also frequent subjects of Bezalel artists. Many of the students went on to become well-known artists, among them Meir Gur Aryeh, Ze'ev Raban, Shmuel Ben David, Ya'ackov Ben-Dov, Zeev Ben-Zvi, Jacob Eisenberg, Jacob Pins, Jacob Steinhardt and Hermann Struck.Ze'ev Raban, A Hebrew Symbolist, by Batsheva Goldman Ida, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2001 In 1912, Bezalel had one female student, Marousia (Miriam) Nissenholtz, who used the pseudonym Chad Gadya. Bezalel closed in 1929 in the wake of financial difficulties. After Hitler's rise to power, Bezalel's board of directors asked Josef Budko, who had fled Germany in 1933, to reopen it and serve as its director. The New Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts opened in 1935, attracting many teachers and students from Germany, many of them from the Bauhaus school shut down by the Nazis. Budko recruited Jakob Steinhardt and Mordecai Ardon to teach at the school, and both succeeded him as directors. In 1958, the first year that the prize was awarded to an organization, Bezalel won the Israel Prize for painting and sculpture. In 1969, Bezalel became a state-supported institution. In 1975 it was recognized by the Council for Higher Education in Israel as an institute of higher education. It completed its relocation to Mount Scopus in 1990. Ceramics: the \\"Bezalel tiles\\" Bezalel tiles on the facade of the Moshav Zkenim Synagogue Bezalel tile scene, Lederberg House Decorative ceramic tiles with figurative motives with both biblical and Zionist scenes were created in the 1920s at the Bezalel School, with some surviving until today. In Tel Aviv some of the best known examples are the following: * Lederberg House (1925) at the corner of Allenby Street and Rothschild Boulevard, ceramic tiles designed by Ze'ev Raban * Moshav Zkenim Synagogue (also spelled Zekenim), 89 Allenby Street * Municipal School, 37 Ahad Ha‚ÄôAm Street (built 1924) * Bialik House, or Beit Bialik There are Bezalel-made ceramic street signs surviving in Jerusalem. Bezalel pavilion Bezalel Pavilion near Jaffa Gate Bezalel pavilion was a tin-plated wooden structure with a crenelated roof and tower built outside Jaffa Gate in 1912. It was a shop and showroom for Bezalel souvenirs. The pavilion was demolished by the British authorities six years later. Bezalel style Bezalel developed a distinctive style of art, known as the Bezalel school, which portrayed Biblical and Zionist subjects in a style influenced by the European jugendstil (art nouveau) and traditional Persian and Syrian art. The artists blended \\"varied strands of surroundings, tradition and innovation,\\" in paintings and craft objects that invokes \\"biblical themes, Islamic design and European traditions,\\" in their effort to \\"carve out a distinctive style of Jewish art\\" for the new nation they intended to build in the ancient Jewish homeland. Today Bezalel on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem In 2006, the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design celebrated its 100th anniversary. Today, it is located on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem and has 1,500 students. Faculties include Fine Arts, Architecture, Ceramic Design, Industrial Design, Jewelry, Photography, Visual Communication, Animation, Film, and Art History & Theory. The architecture campus is in downtown Jerusalem, in the historic Bezalel building. Bezalel offers Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.), Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.), Bachelor of Design (B.Des.) degrees, a Master of Fine Arts in conjunction with Hebrew University, two different Master of Design (M.des) degrees and Theory and Policy of art (M.A.) The academy has plans to move back to the city center. In 2011, the Bezalel student show at the Milan Furniture Fair was described as a \\"lively runner-up\\" for the best exhibit.

Rear Admiral James Edward Jouett (7 February 1826 ‚Äì 30 September 1902), known as \\"Fighting Jim Jouett of the American Navy\\", was an officer in the United States Navy during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American Civil War. His father was Matthew Harris Jouett, a notable painter, and his grandfather was Revolutionary War hero Jack Jouett. Biography Born near Lexington, Kentucky, Jouett was appointed Midshipman 10 September 1841. He served on the African coast on the Decatur with Matthew C. Perry and on the John Adams during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. American Civil War At the beginning of the Civil War, Jouett was captured by Confederates at Pensacola, Florida but was soon paroled. He then joined the blockading forces off Galveston, Texas, distinguishing himself during the night of 7/8 November 1861 in the capture and destruction of Confederate schooner Royal Yacht, while serving on USS Santee. Jouett later commanded the Montgomery and R. R. Cuyler on blockading duty and in September 1863 took command of the Metacomet. In the Battle of Mobile Bay, 5 August 1864, his ship, the Metacomet, was lashed to Admiral David Farragut's flagship Hartford as the ships entered the bay. Monitor Tecumseh was sunk by an underwater \\"torpedo\\", but the ships steamed on, inspired by Farragut's famous command: \\"Damn the torpedoes! Four bells! Captain Drayton go ahead! Jouett full speed!\\" Metacomet was sent after two Confederate gunboats, and in a short chase Jouett riddled the Gaines and captured the Selma. Post-Civil War and last years Jouett had various commands ashore and afloat after the Civil War, taking command of the North Atlantic Squadron in 1884. In 1885 he commanded a naval force which forced the opening of the isthmus of Panama, threatened by insurrection.

It debuted on US television in 1964. As with Speed Racer, the characters' original names were altered and the original series' violence was toned down for American viewers.CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records The dub was created by Fred Ladd distributed in the US by Peter Rodgers Organization. A new series was produced in Japan in 1980 and was later shown as The New Adventures of Gigantor, on the Sci Fi Channel from 1993 to 1997.  Plot  The series is set in the year 2000. The show follows the exploits of little Jimmy Sparks, a 12-year-old boy who controls Gigantor, a huge flying robot, with a remote control. The robot is made of steel and has a rocket-powered backpack for flight, a pointy nose, eyes that never move and incredible strength, but no intelligence (although he started to tap his head as if trying to think in one episode). Whoever has the remote control controls Gigantor. Originally developed as a weapon by Jimmy's father, Gigantor was later reprogrammed to act as a guardian of peace. Jimmy Sparks lives with his uncle, Dr. Bob Brilliant, on a remote island. Jimmy usually wears shorts and a jacket, carries a firearm and occasionally drives a car. Together, Jimmy and Gigantor battle crime around the world and clash with the many villains who are always trying to steal or undermine the giant robot.  History  In 1963, Fred Ladd, while working on the animated feature Pinocchio in Outer Space and on the animated TV series The Big World of Little Adam had seen artwork of Mitsuteru Yokoyama presenting a giant robot remote- controlled by a young boy. The Tokyo-based artist had designed the robot for a Japanese sh≈çnen manga series Tetsujin-28 and later a black-and-white animated TV series called Tetsujin 28-go. Ladd, who had produced the successful international, English-language adaptation of Astro Boy, and Al Singer formed a corporation called Delphi Associates, Inc. to produce and distribute an English-language version of Tetsujin 28-g≈ç. They took only 52 episodes of the black-and-white Japanese series for the American market and renamed the series Gigantor. Peter Fernandez wrote much of the English script and participated in the dubbing. The series became an immediate hit with juvenile audiences, though adult reactions were sometimes hostile. Despite the fact that the Tetsujin 28-go manga (which debuted in 1956) predates the Marvel Comics character Iron Man (who debuted in 1963), Tetsujin 28-go (which literally means \\"Iron Man No. 28\\") could not be released as Iron Man in North America due to the Marvel character Iron Man appearing in that market before Tetsujin debuted there, so the series was renamed Gigantor for the American version. It was playing at 7:00 p.m. on New York's WPIX-TV in January 1966 when Variety gave it a particularly scathing review, calling it a \\"loud, violent, tasteless and cheerless cartoon\\" which was \\"strictly in the retarded babysitter class\\". The reviewer added that Gigantor was popular; he said, \\"Ratings so far are reportedly good, but strictly pity the tikes and their misguided folks.\\"Variety, January 26, 1966 Gigantor became a popular Japanese export during this time. The series was shown in Australia on Melbourne television in January 1968 through Trans-Lux, on ATV-0 at 5:00 pm. It was described by the TV Week as an \\"animated science fiction series about the world's mightiest robot, and 12-year-old Jimmy Sparks who controls the jet-propelled giant\\". The series aired in other markets around Australia, including Sydney on TEN-10, and in Adelaide, South Australia on SAS-10, (its debut on Monday October 28, 1968, at 5.55 pm).Lannan, Kelly Patrick.

Gigantor was one of a number of Japanese TV series that enjoyed strong popularity with young viewers in Australia during the 1960s. The first and undoubtedly the most successful of these was the hugely successful live-action historical adventure series The Samurai, the first Japanese TV series ever screened in Australia, which premiered in late 1964. It was followed by a contemporary ninja-based live action espionage series, Phantom Agents, and a number of popular Japanese animated series including Astro Boy, Ken The Wolf Boy, Prince Planet and Marine Boy. In July 1994, Fox Family Films, a division of 20th Century Fox, acquired the rights to \\"Gigantor\\" for a live-action motion picture.Parker, Donna.

Anticipating that Gigantor would become a franchise for the studio, Fox tapped screenwriters Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes to prepare the script and budgeted between $35 million and $50 million for the film. Executive producers Fred Ladd and Aeiji Katayama indicated that Mitsuteru Yokoyama would get an executive producer credit and that the 50-foot robot would be updated and modernized for the 1990s with a 12-foot height and morphed and computer-generated features. However, the project has yet to come to fruition and Mitsuteru Yokoyama has since died.  Characters  Whimsical English names were given to the show's characters, such as \\"Dick Strong\\", a secret agent; a funny policeman named \\"Inspector Blooper\\"; and enemies, such as, \\"The Spider\\", \\"Dubble Trubble\\", and \\"Dr. Katzmeow\\". Other characters included Bob Brilliant's teenage son, Button, as well as his housekeeper, Lotus. Jimmy Spark's voice was that of Billie Lou Watt. The voice of Inspector Blooper was that of Ray Owens. Old time radio listeners might find the Inspector Blooper sounds a lot like the Willard Waterman/Harold Peary-voiced character \\"The Great Gildersleeve\\". Gilbert Mack voiced Dick Strong.

In 1993, Ladd and the TMS animation studio converted the series into The New Adventures of Gigantor and broadcast it on America's Sci-Fi Channel from September 9, 1993, to June 30, 1997. During this time, the series was shown on Spanish television under the name Iron-Man 28. There was also a sequel series, Tetsujin 28 fx (Tetsujin- nijuhachi-go-Efu-Ekkusu), about the son of the original controller operating a new robot (with his father and the original FX-less No. 28 appearing from time to time to help), which ran in Japan in 1992. In 2004, a new Tetsujin 28-go series was made which returned to the original story established by the manga and original anime series. This version was released in the United States on DVD under the original Japanese title of Tetsujin 28. Unlike Gigantor, however, the English translation of this series is closer to the original Japanese version, with all Japanese names retained. A number of characters and robots from the Tetsujin 28 series appeared (albeit with altered backgrounds) in Giant Robo: The Animation, an OAV series that drew on Mitsuteru Yokoyama's entire body of work. In one of the Giant Robo parodic spin-off OAVs, \\"Mighty GinRei\\" (Tetsuwan GinRei), a version of the original Tetsujin appears under the name \\"Jintetsu\\". A comic version of Gigantor ran in the Triple Action anthology series from Eternity Comics from issues #1‚Äì4. An American-made Gigantor comic book series was released in 2000 by Antarctic Press. The comic lasted for 12 issues and was later collected in 2005 in trade paperback form. The comic used elements from the anime Giant Robo as well as Marvel Comics references, though the later issues became closer to the original animation. The creators of Gigantor have unveiled plans for another updated design, a \\"Gigantor for the New Millennium.\\" This newest form of the giant robot is called G3 and differs from past designs.

The series centers on the adventures of a young boy named Shotaro Kaneda, who controls a giant robot named Tetsujin 28, built by his late father. The manga was later adapted into four anime television series, a Japanese television drama and two films, one live action and one animated. Released in 1963, the first series was among the first Japanese anime series to feature a giant robot. It was later released in the United States as Gigantor. A live-action movie with heavy use of CGI was produced in Japan in 2005. The series is credited with featuring the first humanoid giant robot controlled externally via remote control by an operator. Plot In the final phase of the Pacific War, the Imperial Japanese Army were developing a gigantic robot \\"Tetsujin 28-go\\" as the secret weapon to fight against the Allies. However, Japan surrendered before they could complete its construction. After the war, Dr. Kaneda (the developer of Tetsujin 28-go) passed his robot to his son Shotaro Kaneda. Characters *: The ten-year-old son of Dr. Kaneda. He is Tetsujin's assigned controller, with a deep emotional attachment to the robot. Shotaro is a boy detective famous throughout Tokyo, and in the manga, 1963 series, and 2004 series, can be seen frequently driving a car. *: Dr. Kaneda's assistant, later Shotaro's mentor and guardian. He is caring and very dedicated to his work, but usually looks serious and deadpan. He is married, and has a son named Tetsuo. *: The Chief of Tokyo Police. He is warm in personality and very enthusiastic, which isn't to say he doesn't take his job seriously. He is very close to Shikishima and also takes care of Shotaro, even acting as a surrogate father in the 2004 series. *: A former intelligence officer who begins to help Otsuka and Shotaro's work. His appearances in the 1960s and 2004 series are starkly different; he is immediately Shotaro's ally in the 1960s, but in the 2004 series, his brothers Ryuusaku and Tatsu are killed during Tetsujin's revival, causing him to seek revenge for several episodes. In the original manga, he and Ryuusaku are the leaders of a criminal organization. *: A reclusive mad scientist who created the robot Black Ox. He is calm and very knowledgeable, but unfortunately uses his talents to create dangerous robots. In the original version of the 1960s series, his name is Dr. Black Dog. *: An American man who volunteered himself to be turned into an android as part of a wartime experiment. As a result, his body is entirely robotic with the exception of his brain, and is often covered in bandages. In the 2004 series, he steals his brother Johnson's identity in order to kill the doctor that made him this way. Publication Tetsujin 28-go was serialized in Kobunsha's Sh≈çnen Magazine from July 1956 to May 1966, for a total of 97 chapters. The series was collected into 12 tank≈çbon volumes, which are re-released every ten years. Design Yokoyama's Tetsujin, much like Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy, was influenced by the artist's wartime experiences. In Yokoyama's case, this was through the bombing of Kobe in World War II. As he had written in Ushio magazine in 1995, \\"When I was a fifth- grader, the war ended and I returned home from Tottori Prefecture, where I had been evacuated. The city of Kobe had been totally flattened, reduced to ashes. People said it was because of the B-29 bombers...as a child, I was astonished by their terrifying, destructive power.\\" Another influence on Tetsujin's creation was the Vergeltungswaffen, a set of wonder weapons designed for long- range strategic bombing during World War II, and the idea that Nazi Germany possessed an \\"ace in the hole to reverse [its] waning fortunes\\". The third work to inspire Yokoyama's creation was the 1931 film Frankenstein, which shaped Yokoyama's belief that the monster itself is neither good or evil. Adaptations=1963 television series The 1963 television incarnation of Tetsujin 28-go aired on Fuji TV from 20 October 1963 to 25 May 1966. The series initially ended with 84 episodes, but then returned for 13 more, for a total of 97 episodes. The series had mostly short plots that never took up more than three episodes, but was generally more light-hearted than the anime that would succeed it. Shotaro, Otsuka, Shikishima and Murasame functioned as a team in this version. Only 52 of the 97 episodes were ever dubbed in English. 1980 television series The 1980-81 Shin Tetsujin 28-go (New Tetsujin 28) series was created with 51 color episodes based on a modernized take upon the original concept art. In 1993, Fred Ladd and the TMS animation studio converted the series into The New Adventures of Gigantor and had it broadcast on America's Sci-Fi Channel from September 9, 1993 to June 30, 1997. =Tetsujin 28-go FX= Ch≈ç Dend≈ç Robo Tetsujin 28-go FX is a sequel to Tetsujin 28-go directed by Tetsuo Imazawa and produced at the Tokyo Movie Shinsha studio. It ran on Nippon Television from April 5, 1992 to March 30, 1993, totaling 47 episodes. It has been brought over to Latin America, but never released in English-speaking countries. The show follows Shotaro's son, Masato, who controls a new edition of Tetsujin and works at a detective agency with other children. Among them are Shiori Nishina, granddaughter of Chief Otsuka. The Tetsujin FX (Iron Hero 28 Future X) is controlled by a remote control gun, which has to be aimed at the robot for it to take commands. ;Cast * Yusuke Numata as Masato Kaneda * Hideyuki Tanaka as Shotaro Kaneda (adult) * Eiko Yamada as Shotaro Kaneda (child) * Ai Orikasa as Yoko Kaneda * Fumihiko Tachiki as Ken'ichi Tsukasa * Etsuko Kozakura as Futaba Mitsue * Takeshi Kusao as Saburo Natsuki * Akiko Hiramatsu as Shiori Nishina 2004 television series Written and directed by Yasuhiro Imagawa, the 2004 remake takes place ten years after World War II, approximately the same time as the manga debuted. The new television series has been released in the United States under its original name Tetsujin-28 by Geneon and in the United Kingdom by Manga Entertainment, the first time a Tetsujin-28 property has not been localized to \\"Gigantor\\" in America or other English speaking nations. The television series focused mainly on Shotaro's pursuit to control and fully understand Tetsujin's capabilities, all the while encountering previous creations and scientists from the Tetsujin Project. While not fully based on the original manga, it followed an extremely different storyline than in the 1960s series. On March 31, 2007, a feature-length film, entitled \\"Tetsujin 28-go: Hakuchu no Zangetsu\\" (which translates as \\"Tetsujin #28: The Daytime Moon\\") was released in Japanese theaters. The film used the same character designs and scenery as the 2004 television series, albeit the film remade the series from the beginning. Among the changes, a new character \\"Shoutarou\\" debuted, Shotaro's older half-brother who was in the same airforce troop as Ryuusaku Murasame. Also a character named Tsuki, with a heavily bandaged body, attempts to murder Shotaro. 2004 PlayStation 2 video game In Sandlot's videogame adaption, released July 1, 2004, you control Tetsujin 28 from the point of view of Shotaro Kaneda--able to control both Shotaru and Tetsujin 28. The control method is slightly simplified compared to Sandlot's other giant robot games such as Robot Alchemic Drive, in that you are not asked to control each leg separately. But you gain the ability to fly Tetsujin 28, and well as have him pick up buildings, enemies, and even Shotaru. The game uses the same voice actors as the animation, though it takes presentation cues from the anime, the manga, as well as the kaiju film genre. 2005 live-action film A live-action adaptation of the series, directed by Shin Togashi, was released in Japan on March 19, 2005. It was later released on DVD in the US by Geneon Entertainment and by Manga Entertainment in the UK. The film centers on Shotaro (Sosuke Ikematsu), who is living in the modern age with his widowed mother. He discovers Tetsujin 28, a giant robot left for him by his father (Hiroshi Abe). With the help of Chief Otsuka and classmate Mami Tachibana, Shotaro learns to control Tetsujin and does battle with the villainous Dr. Reiji Takumi and Black Ox. Cancelled Imagi Animation film On December 26, 2008, Felix Ip, the creative director of Imagi Animation Studios, revealed screenshots from a computer-animated teaser trailer featuring Tetsujin and Black Ox. On January 9, 2009, the Japanese animation company Hikari Productions and Imagi launched the projects website, as well as the full teaser featuring Shotaro and Dr. Franken. The film was subsequently cancelled, along with several other projects, when Imagi went defunct in 2010. U.S. live-action film Idlewild director Bryan Barber reportedly acquired the rights to Gigantor in 2011, with plans to adapt it into a feature film. The project never came to fruition, however, and no further developments have been made since. US adaptations In the US adaptation of the 1963 Tetsujin 28 series, which was done by Fred Ladd, all of the character names were changed, and the wartime setting removed. Shotaro Kaneda became Jimmy Sparks, Dr. Shikishima became Dr. Bob Brilliant, Inspector Otsuka became Inspector Ignatz J. Blooper, and Kenji Murasame became Dick Strong. The series' setting was pushed forward to the year 2000. The 1980 television series was also exported to America in 1993, retitled as The New Adventures of Gigantor, with most of Fred Ladd's names intact. The 2004 television series, released by Geneon, retained all of its original names. Despite the fact that the Tetsujin 28-go manga (which debuted in 1956) predates the Marvel Comics character Iron Man (who debuted in 1963), Tetsujin 28-go (which literally means \\"Iron Man No. 28\\") could not be released as Iron Man in North America due to the Marvel character Iron Man appearing in that market before Tetsujin debuted there, so the series was renamed Gigantor for the American version. Legacy * The shotacon genre of Japanese fiction, which focuses on a sexual attraction to young boys, is said to be linked to Tetsujin 28-gos Shotaro as an early example of the archetypal boys the genre focuses on; indeed, the term \\"shotacon\\" is said to be short for \\"Shotaro Complex\\".Sait≈ç Tamaki (2007). \\"Otaku Sexuality\\" in Christopher Bolton, Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr., and Takayuki Tatsumi ed., page 236 Robot Ghosts and Wired Dreams .

He also borrowed the name Shikishima for the colonel and the name of Shikishima's son, Tetsuo, for the character Tetsuo Shima, he has stated in the Akira Club book that it could be said that Akira is based on Tetsujin 28-go (Akira himself is referred to as \\"No. 28\\" by the scientists experimenting on the espers). * The U.S. edition of the show, Gigantor, was spoofed in SNL's \\"Torboto\\" sketch.

Annagh lost out to the latter in the Bob Radcliffe Cup semi-final earlier in that season.

It occurred when a crowded passenger train was destroyed on a coastal railway in Sri Lanka by a tsunami which followed the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The tsunami subsequently caused over 30,000 reported deaths and billions of rupees in property damage in the coastal areas of Sri Lanka. Train Train # Matara Express was a regular train operating between the cities of Colombo and Galle. The route runs along the southwestern coast of Sri Lanka, and at Telwatta, only about inland from the sea. On Sunday, 26 December 2004, during both the Buddhist full moon holiday and the Christmas holiday weekend, it left Colombo's Fort Station shortly after 6:50 A.M. with over 1,500 paid passengers and an unknown number of unpaid passengers including the ones with travel passes (called Seasons) and government travel permits. The train was pulled by locomotive #591 Manitoba, a Sri Lanka Railways class M2a built in 1956 by General Motors Diesel of Canada as a model G12. Attempts to stop the train Sri Lanka's seismic monitoring station at Pallekele registered the earthquake within minutes but did not consider it possible for a tsunami to reach the island.Bruce Parker -The Power of the Sea: Tsunamis, Storm Surges, Rogue Waves 2012 0230112242 \\"Seismologists at Sri Lanka's only seismic monitoring station, at Pallekele, Kandy, knew of the earthquake off Sumatra within minutes of its initial shaking at the epicenter, but they thought it was too far away for a tsunami to reach Sri Lanka.\\" When tsunami reports first reached the dispatching office in Maradana, officials were able to halt eight trains running on the Coastal Line, but were unable to reach the Matara Express. Efforts to halt the train at Ambalangoda failed because all station personnel were assisting with the train, and no one was available to answer the phone until after the train had departed. Attempts to reach personnel at stations further south failed as they had fled or been killed by the waves. Tsunami waves strike the crowded train At 9:30 A.M., in the village of Peraliya, near Telwatta, the beach saw the first of the gigantic waves thrown up by the earthquake. The train came to a halt as water surged around it, and an alarm sounded to alert the population about the increase in the water level. Hundreds of locals, believing the train to be secure on the rails, climbed onto the top of the cars to avoid being swept away. Others stood behind the train, hoping it would shield them from the force of the water. The first wave flooded the carriages and caused panic amongst the passengers. Ten minutes later a huge wave picked the train up and smashed it against the trees and houses which lined the track, crushing those seeking shelter behind it. The eight carriages were so packed with people that the doors could not be opened while they filled with water, drowning almost everyone inside as the water washed over the wreckage several more times. The passengers on top of the train were thrown clear of the uprooted carriages, and most drowned or were crushed by debris. Locomotive #591 Manitoba was carried 100 metres (328 feet), coming to rest in a swamp. Both engineer Janaka Fernando and assistant Sivaloganathan died at their posts. Estimates based on the state of the shoreline and a high-water mark on a nearby building place the tsunami 7.5 to 9 meters (24 to 29 feet) above sea level and 2 to 3 meters (6 to 9 feet) higher than the top of the train. Casualties Due to the huge scale of the tsunami disaster, the local authorities were unable to cope with the devastation, and emergency services and the military were so overwhelmed that immediate rescue was not possible. In fact, the Sri Lankan authorities had no idea where the train was for several hours, until it was spotted by an army helicopter around 4:00 PM. The local emergency services were destroyed, and it was a long time before help arrived. Dozens of people badly injured in the disaster died in the wreckage during the day, and many bodies were not retrieved for over a week. Some families descended on the area determined to find their relatives themselves. A forensic team from Colombo photographed and fingerprinted the unclaimed bodies at Batapola Hospital so the records could be stored and looked at after the bodies were buried. According to the Sri Lankan authorities, only about 150 people on the train survived. The estimated death toll was at least 1,700 people, and probably over 2,000, although only approximately 900 bodies were recovered, as many were swept out to sea or taken away by relatives. The town of Peraliya was also destroyed, losing hundreds of citizens and all but ten buildings to the waves. Venerable Baddegama Samitha, a Buddhist monk, helped perform funeral rites along with his students. More than 200 of the bodies retrieved were not identified or claimed, and were buried three days later in a Buddhist ceremony near the torn railway line. Aftermath The first anniversary ceremonies were held among the rebuilt town alongside the repaired railway, which still operates a Colombo to Galle service, employing the same guard, W. Karunatilaka, who was on the train and survived the disaster. Locomotive #591 Manitoba and two of the damaged carriages were salvaged and rebuilt. A wave was added to the locomotive's paint job as a memorial. The rebuilt locomotive and carriages returned to Peraliya on 26 December 2008, and every year since, to take part in a religious ceremony and a memorial, held to remember those who lost their lives.Daily Mirror Online Edition, 26 December 2008.

Biography ≈åtsuka was born in Shimane Prefecture. During a visit to Tsuwano at the age of 10, he saw a steam locomotive for the first time. He began to take an interest in locomotives and their operation and would frequently sketch them. In 1945 his family moved to Yamaguchi Prefecture where there was a military base. He began to draw the array of military vehicles located there while also drawing a variety of subjects in different styles. Otsuka also collected cuttings of cartoon strips into scrapbooks to learn more about drawing styles. Otsuka later joined the Yamaguchi's Beurau of Statistics but wanted to become a political cartoonist in Tokyo. However at the time, permission was needed to move to Tokyo so he applied to the Health and Welfare Ministry. After passing the exam he was assigned to the drug enforcement division as an assistant who maintained the firearms of the agents. Around this time he suffered from tuberculosis. Career During 1956 Otsuka saw an advertisement in Yomiuri Shinbun where Toei were asking for applications for animators. After passing the test Otsuka worked with Yasuji Mori and Akira Daikubara on the Tale of the White Serpent and learnt their approaches. Wanting to learn more animation theory, he began to seek out textbooks and was shown a textbook on US animation written by Preston Blair. After working on Magic Boy in 1959 his animation of a skeleton was unintentionally considered comical due to its realism. This led to comical bad guy characters becoming Otsuka's speciality. He came to believe that genuine realism doesn't suit animation and \\"constructed realism\\" is more suitable. Hayao Miyazaki compared Otsuka to Kenichi Enomoto in the use of this approach. After completion of his next film The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots Otsuka left Toei to join A Production. Otsuka has written several books about the anime industry. His ' is considered \\"a prime resource for the history of 1960s and 1970s anime\\". In July 2002 an exhibition of his work and personal pieces was held in Ginza. As of 2003, Otsuka is an advisor to Telecom Animation Film.

The club, founded in 1901, hails from Belfast and plays its home matches at Skegoneill Avenue. Club colours are royal blue. The current manager is Darren Dempster In 2009, the club, which had failed to gain a place in the IFA Championship in 2008 and instead played in the IFA Interim Intermediate League, elected not to apply again for membership of the IFA Championship and announced that it would step down into the Ballymena & Provincial Intermediate League for season 2009‚Äì10, ending over 50 years at national intermediate level. History Formed in 1901 and named after Brantwood Street, the club first played at the Glen, Alexandra Park Avenue. They won the Irish Junior Cup in 1913-14. From 1920 until 1930 they played at Dunmore Park, during which time they won the Intermediate League twice (1920‚Äì21 and 1924‚Äì25) and Steel & Sons Cup once. After 1930, Brantwood were unable to secure an extension to the lease at Dunmore Park and became homeless.

Life and career Evelyn Farquhar, wife of Captain Francis Douglas Farquhar John Lavery was born in inner North Belfast, baptised at St Patrick's Church, Belfast and, while still a child, moved to Scotland where he attended Haldane Academy in Glasgow in the 1870s and the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris in the early 1880s. He returned to Glasgow and was associated with the Glasgow School. William Burrell, a wealthy shipowner, was a faithful patron of Scottish artists including Joseph Crawhall II, with whom Lavery studied. In 1888 he was commissioned to paint the state visit of Queen Victoria to the Glasgow International Exhibition. This launched his career as a society painter and he moved to London soon after. In 1896, William Burrell commissioned Lavery to paint a portrait of his sister Mary Burrell.Portrait of Miss Mary Burrell 1896 This portrait was exhibited widely and is considered one of Lavery's finest works. Another portrait of Mrs Burrell was altered to become the \\"Red Rose\\" portrait of Hazel Lavery. In his memoir, Lavery acknowledged Burrell's patronage.Lavery, John (1940) \\"The Life of a Painter\\" Boston: Little Brown In London he became friendly with James McNeill Whistler and was clearly influenced by him. Like William Orpen, Lavery was appointed an official artist in the First World War. Ill health, however, prevented him from travelling to the Western Front. A serious car crash during a Zeppelin bombing raid also kept him from fulfilling this role as war artist. He remained in Britain and mostly painted boats, aeroplanes and airships. During the war years he was a close friend of the Asquith family and spent time with them at their Sutton Courtenay Thames-side residence, painting their portraits and idyllic pictures like Summer on the River (Hugh Lane Gallery). After the war he was knighted and in 1921 he was elected to the Royal Academy. His work was also part of the art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics, the 1928 Summer Olympics, and the 1932 Summer Olympics. During this time, he and his wife, Hazel, were tangentially involved in the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. They gave the use of their London home to the Irish negotiators during the negotiations leading to the Anglo-Irish Treaty. After Michael Collins was assassinated, Lavery painted Michael Collins, Love of Ireland, now in the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery in Dublin. In 1929, Lavery made substantial donations of his work to both The Ulster Museum and the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery and in the 1930s he returned to Ireland. He received honorary degrees from the University of Dublin and Queen's University Belfast. He was also made a freeman of both Dublin and Belfast. A long-standing member of Glasgow Art Club, Lavery exhibited at the club's annual exhibitions, including its exhibition in 1939 in which his The Lake at Ranelagh was included. Personal life Woman with golden turban, Hazel Lavery n√©e Hazel Martyn Hazel in rose and grey Lavery was an orphan raised by relatives. Lavery's first wife, Kathleen MacDermott, whom he married in 1889, died of tuberculosis in 1891, shortly after the birth of their daughter, Eileen (later Lady Sempill, 1890‚Äì1935). In 1909 Lavery remarried, to Hazel Martyn (1886‚Äì1935), an Irish-American known for her beauty and poise, who had a daughter, Alice Trudeau (Mrs. Jack McEnery). Hazel Lavery was depicted in more than 400 of her husband's paintings. The sumptuous The Artist's Studio: Lady Lavery with her Daughter Alice and Step-Daughter Eileen, currently is in the National Gallery of Ireland. Hazel Lavery modelled for the allegorical figure of Ireland he painted on commission from the Irish government, reproduced on Irish banknotes from 1928 until 1975 and then as a watermark until the introduction of the Euro in 2002. The Laverys' marriage was tempestuous, and Lady Lavery reportedly was unfaithful. Sir John Lavery died in Rossenarra House, Kilmoganny, Co. Kilkenny on 10 January 1941, aged 84, from natural causes, and was interred in Putney Vale Cemetery.

Thoralf Skolem (1922) was the first to discuss the seemingly contradictory aspects of the theorem, and to discover the relativity of set-theoretic notions now known as non-absoluteness. Although it is not an actual antinomy like Russell's paradox, the result is typically called a paradox, and was described as a \\"paradoxical state of affairs\\" by Skolem (1922: p. 295). Skolem's paradox is that every countable axiomatisation of set theory in first-order logic, if it is consistent, has a model that is countable. This appears contradictory because it is possible to prove, from those same axioms, a sentence that intuitively says (or that precisely says in the standard model of the theory) that there exist sets that are not countable. Thus the seeming contradiction is that a model that is itself countable, and which therefore contains only countable sets, satisfies the first order sentence that intuitively states \\"there are uncountable sets\\". A mathematical explanation of the paradox, showing that it is not a contradiction in mathematics, was given by Skolem (1922). Skolem's work was harshly received by Ernst Zermelo, who argued against the limitations of first-order logic, but the result quickly came to be accepted by the mathematical community. The philosophical implications of Skolem's paradox have received much study. One line of inquiry questions whether it is accurate to claim that any first-order sentence actually states \\"there are uncountable sets\\". This line of thought can be extended to question whether any set is uncountable in an absolute sense. More recently, the paper \\"Models and Reality\\" by Hilary Putnam, and responses to it, led to renewed interest in the philosophical aspects of Skolem's result.  Background  One of the earliest results in set theory, published by Georg Cantor in 1874, was the existence of uncountable sets, such as the powerset of the natural numbers, the set of real numbers, and the Cantor set. An infinite set X is countable if there is a function that gives a one-to-one correspondence between X and the natural numbers, and is uncountable if there is no such correspondence function. When Zermelo proposed his axioms for set theory in 1908, he proved Cantor's theorem from them to demonstrate their strength. L√∂wenheim (1915) and Skolem (1920, 1923) proved the L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem. The downward form of this theorem shows that if a countable first-order axiomatisation is satisfied by any infinite structure, then the same axioms are satisfied by some countable structure. In particular, this implies that if the first order versions of Zermelo's axioms of set theory are satisfiable, they are satisfiable in some countable model. The same is true of any consistent first order axiomatisation of set theory. The paradoxical result and its mathematical implications Skolem (1922) pointed out the seeming contradiction between the L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem on the one hand, which implies that there is a countable model of Zermelo's axioms, and Cantor's theorem on the other hand, which states that uncountable sets exist, and which is provable from Zermelo's axioms. \\"So far as I know,\\" Skolem writes, \\"no one has called attention to this peculiar and apparently paradoxical state of affairs. By virtue of the axioms we can prove the existence of higher cardinalities... How can it be, then, that the entire domain B [a countable model of Zermelo's axioms] can already be enumerated by means of the finite positive integers?\\" (Skolem 1922, p. 295, translation by Bauer-Mengelberg) More specifically, let B be a countable model of Zermelo's axioms. Then there is some set u in B such that B satisfies the first-order formula saying that u is uncountable. For example, u could be taken as the set of real numbers in B. Now, because B is countable, there are only countably many elements c such that c ‚àà u according to B, because there are only countably many elements c in B to begin with. Thus it appears that u should be countable. This is Skolem's paradox. Skolem went on to explain why there was no contradiction. In the context of a specific model of set theory, the term \\"set\\" does not refer to an arbitrary set, but only to a set that is actually included in the model. The definition of countability requires that a certain one-to-one correspondence, which is itself a set, must exist. Thus it is possible to recognise that a particular set u is countable, but not countable in a particular model of set theory, because there is no set in the model that gives a one-to-one correspondence between u and the natural numbers in that model. From an interpretation of the model into our conventional notions of these sets, this means that although u maps to an uncountable set, there are many elements in our intuitive notion of u that don't have a corresponding element in the model. The model, however, is consistent, because the absence of these elements cannot be observed through first-order logic. With u as the reals, these missing elements would correspond to undefinable numbers. Skolem used the term \\"relative\\" to describe this state of affairs, where the same set is included in two models of set theory, is countable in one model, and is not countable in the other model. He described this as the \\"most important\\" result in his paper. Contemporary set theorists describe concepts that do not depend on the choice of a transitive model as absolute. From their point of view, Skolem's paradox simply shows that countability is not an absolute property in first order logic. (Kunen 1980 p. 141; Enderton 2001 p. 152; Burgess 1977 p. 406). Skolem described his work as a critique of (first-order) set theory, intended to illustrate its weakness as a foundational system: :\\"I believed that it was so clear that axiomatisation in terms of sets was not a satisfactory ultimate foundation of mathematics that mathematicians would, for the most part, not be very much concerned with it. But in recent times I have seen to my surprise that so many mathematicians think that these axioms of set theory provide the ideal foundation for mathematics; therefore it seemed to me that the time had come for a critique.\\" (Ebbinghaus and van Dalen, 2000, p. 147)  Reception by the mathematical community  A central goal of early research into set theory was to find a first-order axiomatisation for set theory which was categorical, meaning that the axioms would have exactly one model, consisting of all sets. Skolem's result showed this is not possible, creating doubts about the use of set theory as a foundation of mathematics. It took some time for the theory of first-order logic to be developed enough for mathematicians to understand the cause of Skolem's result; no resolution of the paradox was widely accepted during the 1920s. Fraenkel (1928) still described the result as an antinomy: :\\"Neither have the books yet been closed on the antinomy, nor has agreement on its significance and possible solution yet been reached.\\" (van Dalen and Ebbinghaus, 2000, p. 147). In 1925, von Neumann presented a novel axiomatisation of set theory, which developed into NBG set theory. Very much aware of Skolem's 1922 paper, von Neumann investigated countable models of his axioms in detail. In his concluding remarks, Von Neumann comments that there is no categorical axiomatisation of set theory, or any other theory with an infinite model. Speaking of the impact of Skolem's paradox, he wrote, :\\"At present we can do no more than note that we have one more reason here to entertain reservations about set theory and that for the time being no way of rehabilitating this theory is known.\\"(Ebbinghaus and van Dalen, 2000, p. 148) Zermelo at first considered the Skolem paradox a hoax (van Dalen and Ebbinghaus, 2000, p. 148 ff.), and spoke against it starting in 1929. Skolem's result applies only to what is now called first-order logic, but Zermelo argued against the finitary metamathematics that underlie first-order logic (Kanamori 2004, p. 519 ff.). Zermelo argued that his axioms should instead be studied in second-order logic, a setting in which Skolem's result does not apply. Zermelo published a second-order axiomatisation in 1930 and proved several categoricity results in that context. Zermelo's further work on the foundations of set theory after Skolem's paper led to his discovery of the cumulative hierarchy and formalisation of infinitary logic (van Dalen and Ebbinghaus, 2000, note 11). Fraenkel et al. (1973, pp. 303-304) explain why Skolem's result was so surprising to set theorists in the 1920s. G√∂del's completeness theorem and the compactness theorem were not proved until 1929. These theorems illuminated the way that first-order logic behaves and established its finitary nature, although G√∂del's original proof of the completeness theorem was complicated. Leon Henkin's alternative proof of the completeness theorem, which is now a standard technique for constructing countable models of a consistent first- order theory, was not presented until 1947. Thus, in 1922, the particular properties of first-order logic that permit Skolem's paradox to go through were not yet understood. It is now known that Skolem's paradox is unique to first-order logic; if set theory is studied using higher-order logic with full semantics then it does not have any countable models, due to the semantics being used.  Current mathematical opinion  Current mathematical logicians do not view Skolem's paradox as any sort of fatal flaw in set theory. Kleene (1967, p. 324) describes the result as \\"not a paradox in the sense of outright contradiction, but rather a kind of anomaly\\". After surveying Skolem's argument that the result is not contradictory, Kleene concludes \\"there is no absolute notion of countability.\\" Hunter (1971, p. 208) describes the contradiction as \\"hardly even a paradox\\". Fraenkel et al. (1973, p. 304) explain that contemporary mathematicians are no more bothered by the lack of categoricity of first-order theories than they are bothered by the conclusion of G√∂del's incompleteness theorem that no consistent, effective, and sufficiently strong set of first-order axioms is complete. Countable models of ZF have become common tools in the study of set theory. Forcing, for example, is often explained in terms of countable models. The fact that these countable models of ZF still satisfy the theorem that there are uncountable sets is not considered a pathology; van Heijenoort (1967) describes it as \\"a novel and unexpected feature of formal systems.\\" (van Heijenoort 1967, p. 290)  References    Stephen Cole Kleene, (1952, 1971 with emendations, 1991 10th printing), Introduction to Metamathematics, North- Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam NY. . cf pages 420-432: ¬ß 75.

The club, founded in 1952, hails from Antrim and plays its home matches at Allen Park. Club colours are red and white. The current manager is Stephen Hughes. They have a large youth set-up which was founded for the 2005‚Äì06 season. The club joined the Northern Amateur Football League in 1953 and became one of its leading clubs before being elevated to the Irish League B Division in 1975. The club stayed at this level until failing to gain a place in the reorganised and re-branded IFA Championship in 2008. The 2008‚Äì09 season was spent in the IFA Interim Intermediate League, but the club gained admission to the Championship in 2009, when it was split into two divisions (Corner entering Championship 2). The club remained at this level until 2014, when they resigned to join the Ballymena & Provincial League. In recent years the club has struggled in the third tier of Northern Irish football, finishing bottom of Championship 2 in 2009‚Äì10, 2010‚Äì11, 2011‚Äì12 and 2012‚Äì13. They were saved from relegation in those seasons by the folding of Newry City, a High Court ruling, and Irish Football Association rules governing the relegation of a club from Championship 2, when no lower regional league champions apply for membership of the Championship. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, relegation was avoided when Newry City folded after the season began, leaving the league system a club short. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, none of the four regional league champions applied for Championship entry, so Corner were spared relegation. They were also saved from relegation in the 2010‚Äì11 season when Dollingstown, playing in the Mid- Ulster Football League Intermediate A division (one tier below IFA Championship 2), finished as league champions but were denied promotion to Championship 2 when they were later found to have fielded an ineligible player in eight league matches. As a result, Dollingstown were deducted all the points that they had gained in the matches the player had taken part in, demoting the club to 4th place in the final league table. The club appealed the decision and took their case all the way to the High Court, but it was dismissed. Tandragee Rovers were crowned champions of the division instead, but did not apply for entry to Championship 2.Dollingstown FC case 'could go to European court'Dollingstown disgust after club loses in court If Dollingstown had won their case they would have been promoted to Championship 2, with Corner being relegated.

He joined Northamptonshire so he could enhance his career and eventually play Test cricket for England, as his native country South Africa were to be banned from International cricket due to the apartheid r√©gime. He retired in 1995 at the age of 41 and currently works for Sky Sports and other TV cricketing broadcasts as an analyst. Personal life Allan Lamb was born to British parents in Langebaanweg, Union of South Africa. His father Mickey was a journeyman club bowler and his mother Joan was an ardent spectator who never willingly missed a match. He attended Wynberg Boys' High School and Abbots College where he played cricket to an 'outstanding' level. Career=Domestic cricket in South Africa In January 1973, Allan made his first team debut at the age of 18 when he played for the Western Province in the Currie Cup. He batted at number three and made 59 and 36 against the Eastern Province.Allan Lamb's debut CricketArchive. Retrieved 30 November 2009. He then had a two-year absence from the game and joined the National Service in the South African Air Force building airfields before returning to the club. Western Province then experimented with Lamb as an opener, at 5 and 6 but 4 was always his true and regular position in the batting order for Western Province. Lamb then had one year playing for Orange Free State, where he scored his highest first-class score of 294, before moving back to the Western Province for the rest of his South African domestic career. County cricket with Northamptonshire Lamb came to England along with two young other cricketers, Peter Kirsten and Garth Le Roux, in search of fame and a county contract and it was Northamptonshire who signed Lamb as a relatively unknown overseas player in 1978. He went on to become a fixture in the side for 17 years, 13 as an England international, winning the 1980 Benson & Hedges Cup Final and the 1992 NatWest Trophy, and in his final season as captain in 1995 he very nearly took Northamptonshire to their first County Championship with 12 wins in their final 17 matches.

Retrieved 8 August 2011.Lamb honoured by county BBC Sport Retrieved 8 August 2011. International for England In 1970, South Africa were banned from international cricket indefinitely because of its government's policy of apartheid, an overtly racist policy, which led them to play only against the white nations and field only white players. This prevented Lamb from playing International cricket unless he emigrated to another nation. It was while in England that he was persuaded to play for them, having already qualified through his British-born parents, and his obvious talent led him to be selected for the national team only four years after moving there. He made his test debut against India in 1982,England v India scorecard 1982 Cricinfo. Retrieved 1 June 2010. and had also made his ODI debut a few days earlier. Lamb, who would go on to play a total of 201 international matches for England (79 Tests, 122 One-Day Internationals), was regarded as a fine player of fast bowling, but like a large number of South African-born batsmen he had a comparative weakness against spin, and his final average of 36 in Tests from over 4,500 runs did not do justice to his ability. Of his 14 Test hundreds, 6 of them came against the West Indies in 22 matches, when he came up against some of the game's finest fast bowlers from Joel Garner and Malcolm Marshall to Courtney Walsh, Curtly Ambrose and Ian Bishop. However, only one of those centuries, in Jamaica in 1990, was in a winning cause, the other 5 seeing England fall to defeat. Lamb was a member of two successful Ashes campaigns (in 1985 and 1986‚Äì87), but did not score a century in either series. In fact his sole Ashes century came at Headingley in 1989 in yet another losing cause. In 20 Ashes matches he scored 1138 runs at an average of over 34. He captained England in three Tests with disappointing results. Lamb had considerably more success as a One-day player, averaging a shade under 40 with over 4,000 runs and being one of only fifteen Englishmen to play in over 100 matches. He played in two World Cup Finals in 1987 and 1992, but perhaps his most famous innings came in the 4th match of the 1987 Benson & Hedges World Series Cup against Australia, where England needed 17 runs to win off the final over to be bowled by Bruce Reid, who was a whole foot taller than him. Lamb hit Reid for 18 runs in 5 balls (2,4,6,2,4) to seal an improbable victory.Australia v England scorecard 1987 Cricinfo. Retrieved 8 August 2011. That over would be the subject of a cheeky banner used for the next match between the two sides which read \\"Can Bruce Reid please call Allan Lamb on 24624\\". England, who had earlier won the Ashes and the four-nation Perth Challenge, would go on to round off their triumphant tour by winning the tournament, which also featured the West Indies. In 1992, during the ODI series against Pakistan, Lamb accused the Pakistani team of tampering with the cricket ball. Lamb was subsequently fined by the TCCB.Bad blood, balls and botches Cricinfo.

It is widely spoken and understood as a second language in Nepal, Bangladesh, and the Persian Gulf and as such is considered a lingua franca in the Indian subcontinent. It is also one of the most widely spoken languages in the world by total number of speakers. It developed in north India, principally during the Mughal Empire, when the Persian language exerted a strong influence on the Western Hindi languages of central India; this contact between the Hindu and Muslim cultures resulted in the core Indic vocabulary of the Indian dialect of Hindi spoken in Delhi, whose earliest form is known as Old Hindi, being enriched with Persian loanwords. Rekhta, or \\"mixed\\" speech, which came to be known as Hindustani, Hindi, Hindavi, and Urdu (derived from Zabaan-i-Ordu by Mashafi meaning \\"language of the Horde\\".), also locally known as Lashkari or Lashkari Zaban in long form, was thus created.Khalid, Kanwal. \\"LAHORE DURING THE GHANAVID PERIOD.\\" This form was elevated to the status of a literary language, and after the partition of colonial India and independence this collection of dialects became the basis for modern standard Hindi and Urdu. Although these official languages are distinct registers with regards to their formal aspects, such as modern technical vocabulary, they continue to be all but indistinguishable in their vernacular forms.  Formation  Most of the grammar and basic vocabulary of Hindustani descends directly from the medieval Indo-Aryan language of central India, known as ≈öauraseni. After the tenth century, several ≈öauraseni dialects were elevated to literary languages, or khari boli (\\"standing dialects\\"), including Braj Bhasha, Awadhi and the language of Delhi (the latter still goes by the name Dehlavi in the rural areas outside the city of Delhi itself). During the reigns of the Turko-Afghan Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire in India, where Persian was adopted as the official language and Delhi was established as the capital, the imperial court and concomitant immigration infused the Indo-Aryan dialect of Hindi spoken in Delhi (the earliest form is known as Old Hindi) with large numbers of Persian, Arabic, and Chagatai words from the court; this occurred as a result of cultural contact between Hindus and Muslims in Hindustan and became the fruit of a composite Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb. The introduced words were primarily nouns and were employed for cultural, legal and political concepts. These Persian and Arabic loanwords form 25% of Urdu's vocabulary. As a form of Hindustani and a member of the Western Hindi category of Indo-Aryan languages, 75% of Urdu words have their etymological roots in Sanskrit and Prakrit, and approximately 99% of Urdu verbs have their roots in Sanskrit and Prakrit. The new court language developed simultaneously in Delhi and Lucknow, the latter of which is in an Awadhi-speaking area; and thus, modern Hindustani has a noticeable Awadhi influence even though it is primarily based on Delhi dialect. In these cities, the language continued to be called \\"Hindi\\" as well as \\"Urdu\\". While Urdu retained the grammar and core vocabulary of the local Hindi dialect, it adopted the Nastaleeq writing system from Persian. The term Hindustani is derived from Hindustan, the Persian-origin name for the northwestern Indian subcontinent. The works of the 13th century scholar Amir Khusro are typical of the Hindustani language of the time: :‡§∏‡•á‡§ú ‡§µ‡•ã ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§®‡•Ä ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∞‡•ã‡§µ‡•Å‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ‡§∞‡•à‡§® ‡•§ :‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§™‡§π‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç, ‡§™‡§≤ ‡§≠‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ñ ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ö‡•à‡§® ‡•• :.ÿ≥€åÿ¨ ŸàŸà ÿ≥ŸàŸÜ€å ÿØ€å⁄©⁄æ ⁄©€í ÿ±ŸàŸà⁄∫ ŸÖ€å⁄∫ ÿØŸÜ ÿ±€Å€å⁄∫ :.Ÿæ€åÿß Ÿæ€åÿß ŸÖ€å⁄∫ ⁄©ÿ±ÿ™ €ÅŸà⁄∫ Ÿæ€Åÿ±Ÿà⁄∫ÿå ŸæŸÑ ÿ®⁄æÿ± ÿ≥⁄©⁄æ ŸÜ€Å ⁄Ü€åŸÜ :sej vo s≈´nƒ´ dekh ke rov≈© maÕ†i din rain, :piyƒÅ piyƒÅ maÕ†i karat h≈´ÃÉ pahr√µ, pal bhar sukh nƒÅ cain. :Seeing the empty bed I cry day and night :Calling for my beloved all day, not a moment of happiness or peace. The language went by several names over the years: Hindavi (\\"of Hindus or Indians\\"), Dahlavi (\\"of Delhi\\"), Hindustani (\\"of Hindustan\\") and Hindi (\\"Indian\\"). The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan built a new walled city in Delhi in 1639 that came to be known as Shahjahanabad. The market close to the royal fort (the Red Fort) was called Urdu Bazar (\\"Army/camp Market\\", from the Turkic word ordu, \\"army\\"), and it may be from this that the phrase Zaban-e-Urdu (\\"the language of the army/camp\\") derives. This was shortened to Urdu around the year 1800. The Mughal term Ordu with the local equivalent Lashkari or \\"camp language\\" (cognate with the English word, \\"horde\\"), was used to describe the common language of the Mughal army. The language spread from the interaction of Persian-speaking Muslim soldiers to the local people who spoke varieties of Hindi. Soon, the Persian script in the cursive Nasta'liq form was adopted, with additional letters to accommodate the Indian phonetic system. Large number of Persian words were adopted in Hindustani, as were even grammatical elements such as the enclitic ezƒÅfe. The official language of the Ghurids, Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, and their successor states, as well as their language of poetry and literature, was Persian, while the official language of religion was Arabic. Most of the sultans and the nobility of the sultanate period were Turkic peoples from Central Asia who spoke Chagatai as their mother tongue. The Mughals were also Chagatai, but later adopted Persian. The basis in general for the introduction of Persian language into the Indian subcontinent was set, from its earliest days, by various Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties.Sigfried J. de Laet. History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century UNESCO, 1994. p 734 Muzaffar Alam asserts that Persian became the lingua franca of the empire under Akbar for various political and social factors due to its non-sectarian and fluid nature.Alam, Muzaffar. \\"The Pursuit of Persian: Language in Mughal Politics.\\" In Modern Asian Studies, vol. 32, no. 2. (May, 1998), pp. 317‚Äì349. However, the armies, merchants, preachers, Sufis, and later the court, also incorporated the local people and elements of the medieval Hindu literary language, Braj Bhasha. This new contact language soon incorporated other dialects, such as Haryanvi, Panjabi, and in the 17th century the dialect of the new capital at Delhi. By 1800, Delhi dialect had become the dominant base of the language.H. Dua, 2006, \\"Urdu\\", in the Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, 2nd edition. When Wali Mohammed Wali arrived in Delhi, he established Hindustani with a light smattering of Persian words, a register called Rekhta, for poetry; previously the language of poetry had been Persian. When the Delhi Sultanate expanded south to the Deccan Plateau, they carried their literary language with them, and it was influenced there by more southerly languages, producing the Dakhini dialect. During this time Hindustani was the language of both Hindus and Muslims. The non-communal nature of the language lasted until the British Raj in India, when in 1837 Hindustani in the Persian script (i.e. Urdu) replaced Persian as the official language and was made co-official along with English. This triggered a Hindu backlash in northwestern India, which argued that the language should be written in the native Devanagari script. This literary standard, called simply Hindi, replaced Urdu as the official register of Bihar in 1881, establishing a sectarian divide of \\"Urdu\\" for Muslims and \\"Hindi\\" for Hindus, a divide that was formalized with the independence of India and Pakistan after the withdrawal of the British.  Poetry  The poet Wali Deccani (1667‚Äì1707) visited Delhi in 1700.Pain and Grace: A Study of Two Mystical Writers of Eighteenth-century Muslim India, By Annemarie Schimmel, BRILL, 1976 His Rekhta or Hindavi ghazals established Hindustani as a medium of poetic expression in the imperial city. Hindustani soon gained distinction as the preferred language in courts of India and eventually replaced Persian among the nobles. To this day, Rekhta retains an important place in literary and cultural spheres. Many distinctly Persian forms of literature, such as ghazals and nazms, came to both influence and be affected by Indian culture, producing a distinct melding of Middle Eastern and South Asian heritages.

It was serialized in Akita Shoten's Weekly Sh≈çnen Champion from July 1994 to August 1996. The manga was adapted into a two episode original video animation in 1996, animated by Ashi Productions and produced by Big West Advertising, Victor Entertainment and Tomy.  Plot  Kakugo and Harara are brothers trained by their father Oboro to fight the monsters roaming in a post-apocalyptic 21st century Tokyo that has become severely damaged as a result of an earthquake. To aid them, Kakugo and Harara are entrusted with \\"Fortified Armor Shells\\", cyborg exoskeletons forged from the souls of deceased warriors by their grandfather Shiro Hagakure, a scientist for the Imperial Army of Japan during World War II. However, Harara succumbs to a mysterious evil within his armor and becomes a female human demon bent on destroying mankind to help Earth recover from contamination. Years later, Kakugo moves to the Reverse Cross High School in one of the ruined districts of Tokyo, near the castle where Harara commands an army of demons. Now it is up to Kakugo to defeat his sibling.  Characters = Main  ;Kakugo Hagakure : :The main protagonist of the series, owner of the Zero armor. Unlike Harara, Kakugo stuck to his duty to protect innocent citizens in trouble. This leads to several encounters with the monsters that inhabit the city and finally Harara himself. He is stern and humorless, and wears glasses and a white uniform inspired on the reglementary Imperial Japanese Navy one. Under his clothes, his body is equipped with four special Steel Balls that allow him to turn most of his body in metal. :His armored form resembles a red-eyed tokusatsu superhero with a long scarf similar to the Kamen Rider series. :Capcom artist Kinu Nishimura had said that Kakugo was the main inspiration for Cyberbots protagonist Jin Saotome. :Kiyotaka Ishimaru from the Danganronpa franchise bears resemblance to Kakugo. ;Harara Hagakure : :Kakugo's older brother and the main antagonist of the series. Harara received the Kasumi armor, but it turned him into an evil hermaphrodite who killed their father and defeated Kakugo in their first battle. Believing humanity responsible for the death of the environment, he has become determined to destroy all humans, with the aid of created beings known as \\"Tactical Evils.\\" :After Kakugo defeats all of Harara's Tactical Evils, Harara possesses the defeated form of Eikichi in an attempt to finally destroy Kakugo. In the ensuing battle, Kakugo manages to emerge victorious over his sibling, leaving Harara on a coma for most of the manga.  Reverse Cross High School  ;Tsumiko Horie : :A girl at the school Kakugo attends. She is constantly described as unattractive, but in turn is kind and bold. She falls in love with Kakugo after witnessing him destroy the city's monsters. She was later kidnapped by Chidokuro and turned into a Tactical Evil, thus forcing Kakugo to fight her, until he kisses her, thus reverting her back to normal. Series creator Takayuki Yamaguchi had named her after Mitsuko Horie (who he is a fan of), and her name can be an anagram of the name Mitsuko. Horie herself would voice Tsumiko in the OVA. ;Hiroshi Haoka : :A feared delinquent at the school, he is a childhood friend to Horie and resents anyone who goes after her. Haoka initially dislikes Kakugo, but eventually comes to respect him. In the OVA, he is injured by Eikichi after managing to carry the case containing Kakugo's Zero armour to the battle, but appears alive at the finale. ;Ponta Takada : :One of Haoka's friends, usually seen with Ponsuke. He is attacked Dogumakuro's Flower, but saved by Kakugo. He is also good at drawing, as shown in Volume 4 where he drew a rough sketch of Chidokuro when the school guards asked him to identify Horie's captor. ;Pyonsuke Fujii : :Haoka's other friend. Generally seen with Ponta. He often carries a sword for protection. ;Aoki : :A friend of Horie. She is distinguished by the bandages she always wears over her face; it is never revealed why she wears them. ;Hoshino : :A senior student, leader of a group of volunteers for the school's protection. ;Mr. Zenigata : :One of the teachers at the school. He doesn't take his job seriously, to the point that he usually drinks alcohol at the school and sleeps through his classes while playing a recording to do his work. He is also constantly dismissive and seems to have little worry for his students, but he is secretly supportive of them. ;School Principal : :The head of the school in New Tokyo. He is a stalker, even having wired Tsumiko's uniform to spy on her, but he really cares for his students. After Tsumiko is kidnapped by Chidokuro, he and other students rush to try to rescue her unsuccessfully. He sacrifices his life to save them all from one of Harara's demons, though later reveals himself to be alive, only badly burnt. ;Kazu Shimada : :A student at Kakugo's school, he falls victim to Hamuko. After having his face sucked off, he is devoured by her and later regurgitated in a partially- digested state during Hamuko's battle with Kakugo, dying shortly afterwards. His body is later cremated by Kakugo after the fight. ;Hiroko Uchiyama : :Shimada's girlfriend, she was killed by Hamuko right in front of him.  Harara's lieutenants  ;Tomohisa :Voiced by: Yuzuru Fujimoto (Japanese) :Harara's adviser. He later gains the ability to transform into a winged lion. ;Kagenari :Voiced by: Kenichi Ogata (Japanese); Terrence Stone (English) :An executive at Harara's fortress. He is responsible for reporting the threat of Kakugo to him. ;Bolt : :Harara's Security Chief. A former old human who tried to defeat Harara, he was turned into a samurai armor-clad demon. He later dons a special Fortified Armor Shell to fight Kakugo. ;Rai :Voiced by: Ryotaro Okiayu (Japanese); Doug Stone (English) :Harara's Security adviser, a musclebound human who tried to defeat her before being converted to his cause. He delivers fighters for Harara to kill at his fortress. His body is equipped with the same Steel Balls as Kakugo. ;Chidokuro :Voiced by: Shigeru Chiba (Japanese); Tony Pope (English) :The general of the Tactical Evils, a cowardly mustachioed man who wears a dark helmet based on Berserk's Femto. He manages to transform Kakugo into a Tactical Evil, only to killed by Kakugo when he reverts back to human form.  Harara's Tactical Evils  ;Hamuko : :A large, obese monster with clown-like features and the first Tactical Evil Kakugo encounters. She enjoys killing females outright and consuming the men they were with. She also wears the face of her most recent victim as a pasty. Although initially attempting to simply subdue her, Kakugo finally kills her after disabling her powers. ;Dogumakuro :Voiced by: Ryotaro Okiayu (Japanese); Derek Stephen Prince (English) :The second Tactical Evil encountered, Dogumakuro is a mutant rock star capable of electrocuting his opponents with his tongue. He can also deploy a microphone from his groin that emits powerful music waves. Kakugo manages to overcome his techniques and defeats him by shattering his skull and evaporating his body. ;Eikichi : :An elderly Tactical Evil who is sent to attack Kakugo. He can solidify his saliva and form weapons with it, and his penis is a dragon head with the same skill. Though he manages to gain the upper hand against the unarmored Kakugo, he is quickly defeated once Kakugo gains his Zero armor. His body is then possessed by Harara and perishes along with her when Kakugo defeats him. ;Megumi : :Taking on the form of a nurse, Megumi is a Tactical Evil who attempts to seduce men before killing them. In her monster form, she has large breasts that serve as tentacles, and is capable of full regeneration. Kakugo kills her by fully dismembering her. Others ;Oboro Hagakure : :The father of Kakugo and Harara who was responsible for their training. Harara ended up turning on him and killed Oboro during a fight. ;Shiro Hagakure :The grandfather of Kakugo and Harara, who created the Fortified Armor Shells and the Tactical Evil technology for Japan to win the Pacific War. He was said to be executed by the Japanese government to cover up his experiments, but he secretly survived thanks to his science. ;Mei Inukai :A nurse working for Shiro Hagakure, wife to a Japanese Imperial soldier named Shinobu Inukai. Both of them were murdered to use their son Tamataro for the creation of the Kasumi armor, but Mei's grudge reached the armor and infused it with hate towards humanity. It was only dissipated after Kakugo destroys the armor and Tsumiko redeems Tamataro's spirit through her love.  Media = Manga  The Apocalypse Zero manga series was written and illustrated by Takayuki Yamaguchi. It was originally serialized in the Akita Shoten magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Champion from 1994 to 1996. A total of 11 tank≈çbon (chapter collections) volumes were published by Akita Shoten. An English translation of the manga was published as a graphic novel in the US by Media Blasters beginning on January 19, 2005. The manga was sold shrink wrapped, presumably due to the large amount of violence. Only six of the original 11 volumes were translated and released, as Media Blasters chose to cease publication of the series in early 2007. The manga was published in Italy by Dynit, flipping it in a left-to-right format. From 2010 to 2014, Yamaguchi wrote Exoskull Zero, a reboot of Apocalypse Zero featuring a similar protagonist in a slightly different plot. It was published in Akita Shoten's Champion Red magazine.  OVA  The Apocalypse Zero anime OVA was co-produced by Victor Entertainment, Tomy and Big West Advertising, it was animated by Ashi Productions and directed by Toshihiro Hirano. It was released in Japan in two volumes from October 23, 1996, to December 18, 1996, on VHS and Laserdisc. The OVA was planned to have ten episodes, but was canceled after the completion of the second episode. The reasons for the OVA's cancellation are currently unknown. The anime was released in Italy in 1999 on VHS, licensed by Dynit. The US license for Apocalypse Zero was acquired by Media Blasters who created a dubbed English language version of the anime translated by Takashi Sakudo and produced by Bang Zoom! Studios. The two VHS volumes were released from June 20 to August 22, 2000. A DVD release containing both episodes was released on August 28, 2001. A Region 2 DVD of the series with both episodes was released in Japan by Toshiba in 2003.  Video game  A video game based on Apocalypse Zero was released on the PlayStation on March 21, 1997, exclusively in Japan by Tomy. The game is a standard 3D fighting game allowing the player to go head-to-head against the CPU or against another player. It features seven characters to choose from based on both the anime and manga, and animated cut scenes taken from the OVA.  Reception  Due to the use of gratuitous violence and repulsive imagery, critical reception to Apocalypse Zero in the west has been largely negative. John Oppliger of AnimeNation called the Apocalypse Zero OVA \\"the most viscerally violent and gruesome anime\\" he has seen and \\"arguably the most grotesque anime ever made\\". Animerica called Apocalypse Zero the \\"Best Anime Splattervision\\" in its \\"Best of the Best\\" awards. \\"When a 45-minute video features a scene where someone's face is sucked off, and that's not even the most shocking thing in the video,\\" the magazine proclaimed, \\"you know you'll be getting your horror-show money's worth.\\" Despite this, the manga was well received and popular in Japan. Apocalypse Zero managed to be one of the finalists for the 1997 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize, losing out to Doraemon by Fujiko Fujio.The Road to Glory: Manga Awards - Tezuka Cultural Award  Context  The Japanese title is an allusion to Fukuzawa_Yukichi#An_Encouragement_of_Learning (Gakumon no Susume) from Yukichi Fukuzawa, an important early Japanese advocate during Meiji Restoration.

Led by Tony McKeague, Portstewart won the league and the Doherty Cup in their debut season. The next season the club progressed into the North West League Division 2 and earned promotion to the North West Division 1. Portstewart took another stride forward in 1979, when they applied to join the Northern Ireland Intermediate League (NIIL). The most defining moment in the club's history came when they appointed Frankie Moffatt, for the first of two spells, as manager in 1984. Moffatt delivered the league title in his first year in charge and followed this up with success in the NIIL Challenge Cup and NIIl League Cup. Following spells at Ballymoney United and then Coleraine, Moffatt returned as manager in 1991. Portstewart created history in 1994, when they defeated Limavady Utd 1‚Äì0 in the William Youngers Intermediate Cup final, becoming the first junior team in over 100 years of the competition to lift the trophy. In 2003, Portstewart were accepted into newly created Irish league Division 2. Moffatt's decision to step down as manager resulted in his assistant Trevor McKendry taking charge of team affairs, and under his leadership Portstewart continued to grow. McKendry led the team to the North West Cup final in 2004 when they were narrowly defeated by Tobermore United. In the 2005/06 season, when Portstewart gained promotion to second tier of Irish League football for the first time in the club's history.

Cowdrey played for Kent, Glamorgan and England as an all-rounder. He is the eldest son of the cricketer and life peer, Colin Cowdrey. He was educated at Tonbridge School. Life and career After a good season for Kent in County cricket in 1984, Cowdrey was selected for England's 1984‚Äì85 tour of India, led by his friend David Gower, ostensibly taking Ian Botham's place after Botham had opted out of the tour. In the First Test in Bombay he was fielding at short leg when Gower asked him to bowl. Although he forgot to take off his shin pads he bowled Kapil Dev with his fourth ball, the 19th England bowler to take a wicket in his first over. His father was listening to Test Match Special in his car and was so surprised that he drove the wrong way down a one-way street.Cowdrey, Chris and Smith, Jonathan (1986) Good Enough? Pelham Books. pp. 59‚Äì60. Following the tour, where he had scored 96 runs and taken four wickets Cowdrey was not selected by England until 1988, and the infamous \\"summer of four captains\\". In that year Cowdrey, who had taken Kent to the top of the Championship table, was given the job to lead the Test side in the fourth Test of a five match series against the West Indies. The West Indies by that point were 2‚Äì0 up, claiming a convincing innings and 156 run victory in the previous test. \\"We believe Cowdrey's style of leadership is what is now required\\",Match Report West Indies 1988.

England lost heavily by ten wickets, and his chance to prove his detractors wrong in the final Test never came, as he was injured after the one appearance and never chosen to captain or play for England again.Chris Cowdrey. Cricinfo.com. Retrieved on 22 May 2018. A newspaper article penned by Cowdrey landed him in trouble in the corridors at Lord's and, in 1990, he joined a rebel tour to South Africa. Colin and Chris Cowdrey were only the second father and son combination to have both captained England, emulating Frank and George Mann. He was captain of Kent from 1986 until 1990. He retired in 1992 after a single season at Glamorgan, and has since been a broadcaster for TalkSport, as well as the occasional project with Sky Sports. In 1986, Cowdrey produced a volume of autobiography, appropriately titled Good Enough, taken from his usual response to comments that he was not as good as his father. Cricket writer Colin Bateman stated, \\"Cowdrey was fortunate to play Test cricket at all, but he did not deserve the shabby treatment which ended his brief England career\\". Cowdrey's son Fabian Cowdrey was awarded a first-team contract at Kent in October 2011, before his May 2012 debut, becoming the fourth Cowdrey to play for the county side and the third generation of the same family to feature on a Kent team sheet.

The club then entered the junior football ranks through competed in competitions under the auspices of Irish Football Association. Oxford United Stars played in North West Saturday Morning League under the auspices of the Irish Football Association and in all the major summer cup competitions throughout the north west of Ireland with great success winning all the major honours.

Subsidiary National City Mortgage is credited for doing the first mortgage in America. The company operated through an extensive banking network primarily in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Wisconsin, and also served customers in selected markets nationally. Its core businesses included commercial and retail banking, mortgage financing and servicing, consumer finance, and asset management. The bank reached out to customers primarily through mass advertising and offered comprehensive banking services online. In its last years, the company was commonly known in the media by the abbreviated NatCity, with its investment banking arm even bearing the official name NatCity Investments. In 2007, National City Corp. ranked number 188 on the Fortune 500 list, and 9th in terms of revenue in the U.S. commercial banking industry with total assets of about $140 billion. PNC Financial Services announced October 24, 2008, its purchase of National City for about $5.2 billion in stock with funds from the U.S. Treasury. At the time of the acquisition, National City had been the 7th largest bank in the United States, two spots ahead of acquirer PNC. The deal was finalized on December 31, 2008, and the National City name was retired on June 14, 2010. Regulatory scrutiny The Wall Street Journal reported on June 6, 2008, that National City Corp. had entered into a memorandum of understanding with federal regulators, effectively putting the bank on probation. Terms of the confidential agreement, entered into a month earlier with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (which regulates nationally chartered banks), were not known. On June 10, 2008, National City Corp. confirmed that it had reached agreements with regulators \\"regarding capital levels, risk-management practices and other aspects of its business.\\" The company stated that there had been no material developments in these areas since these memorandums of understanding were signed in April and May 2008.  History  National City branch in Springboro, Ohio. National City Bank was founded on May 17, 1845, when a group of Cleveland businessmen pooled $50,000 to organize the City Bank of Cleveland, the first bank opened under the Ohio Bank Act of 1845 in a small town with no gas, electricity, public waterworks, or railroad.National City 150th Celebration Book Team: National City ‚Äì 150 Years, 1995 Reuben Sheldon and Theodoric C. Severance, formerly of the Fireman's Insurance Company, organized The City Bank of Cleveland. The city's only bank at the time, opened its doors to the public at No. 52 Superior Street. National City Corporation was one of the principle players in the Dawes Plan to rebuild Germany in the post WWI period, contributing $173,000,000 in loans. Part of which included a $30,000,000 insurance on the securities of Allgemeine Elektrizitats-Gesellschaft (A.E.G.), aka German General Electric, and $35,000,000 to American I.G. Chemical (I.G. Farben). In April 1973, National City Corporation was formed as the holding company for the National City Bank of Cleveland to allow the company to expand outside of Cuyahoga County through the purchase of other banks.

The acquisition was completed in September 2007.  Recent transactions  National City went on an acquisition spree from 2004 through 2008, headed by its $2.1 billion purchase of Cincinnati-based Provident Financial Group. Provident Financial Group's banking arm, Provident Bank, specialized in warehouse lending facilities whereby it extended commercial credit lines to mortgage banking firms so that the mortgage banking firms could make loans to their customers and either keep those loans or sell them in the secondary market to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) or other institutional investors. After the acquisition, National City renamed the division National City Warehouse Resources. The warehouse lending division was a profit center and did not contribute to the bank's downfall. In addition, in 2005, National City acquired Allegiant Bancorp to secure a presence in the St. Louis, Missouri, market. In 2006, they acquired Fidelity Bankshares Inc. for an estimated $1 billion deal that was half cash, half stock. The bank also acquired Harbor Florida Bancshares Inc. through a $1.1 billion stock deal, with both acquired banks located in Florida; these acquisitions gave National City $7.4 billion of assets and 94 branches in Florida. On the other side of the ledger, National City sold to Bank of America its 83% stake in National Processing Company, which earns fees from processing merchant credit card transactions. The sale of San Jose, California, based First Franklin origination franchise and related servicing platform to Merrill Lynch & Co. was completed on December 30, 2006, for $1.3 billion. In May 2007, National City announced the purchase of MAF Bancorp Inc., the holding company for MidAmerica Bank. As of June 30, 2006, MidAmerica Bank had the 9th-ranked market share in the Chicago metropolitan area (Chicago-Joliet-Naperville) at 2.18%. Following the merger using the same dataset, the combined National City and MidAmerica Banks were expected to rank 4th in the Chicago market with a market share of 3.96% and deposits of more than $10 billion. Strategic changes and subsequent downfall In the late 1990s, under former CEO David Daberko, National City began a strategy to increase the yields on its assets. In 1999, the company purchased First Franklin Financial Corp., a large subprime mortgage lender. Instead of selling the loans, as most mortgage companies do, National City retained many of the loans to enhance its net interest spreads. It also aggressively originated loans brought to the company by third-party mortgage brokers, as well as originating a large number of home equity loans. The amount of residential mortgage loans grew rapidly and came to exceed the level of commercial loans. By 2003, National City was the sixth- largest mortgage lender in the country. The company did sell its First Franklin Financial subsidiary in December 2006, but retained a large volume of loans that had been originated by the subsidiary. Management failed to recognize the extent of problems in the subprime market and did not take sufficient aggressive actions to reduce its real estate mortgage portfolio. National City subsequently made several other strategic mistakes, including buying back $3 billion of its stock in early 2007, thereby reducing its level of capital, and expanding into the Florida market in late 2006, just before the real estate market there went into a severe decline. As the subprime mortgage market began going into free fall in mid-2007 and continued into 2008, loan losses mounted. In the third quarter of 2007, the company suffered a net loss of $19 million. By the second quarter of 2008, the company had a net loss of $1.8 billion.  Acquired by PNC  On October 9, 2008, The Wall Street Journal ran an article citing unnamed sources indicating that National City was in talks with several other banks for a possible sale. The article named Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services, Toronto-based Scotiabank, and Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp as the leading contenders. A spokesperson for National City declined to comment on the report. By taking over National City, Scotiabank would be able to \\"obtain a larger presence in the U.S. regional banking arena than their Canadian peers\\", however Scotiabank CEO Rick Waugh declined after they could not properly value National's mortgage assets. On October 24, 2008, PNC announced that it had finalized a purchase agreement for National City. The acquisition was a stock purchase transaction to be completed before the end of 2008. National City would be merged into PNC, and the National City brand would be dissolved. The deal was approved by shareholders of both banks on December 23, 2008, and the acquisition was completed on December 31. The deal made PNC the largest bank in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, as well as the second largest bank in Maryland and Indiana. It greatly expanded PNC's presence in the Midwest, as well as entering PNC into the Florida market. Pittsburgh, Louisville, Kentucky, and Cincinnati were the only three markets before the acquisition in which both banks had a major presence. In the case of Pittsburgh, the two banks had significant overlap, to the point that it would pose antitrust issues in Western Pennsylvania, since both banks had the top two market shares in that region. As a result, the United States Department of Justice required PNC to sell off 50 National City branches in the Pittsburgh area and 11 more branches in and around Erie to competitors. On April 7, 2009, PNC reached a deal with Buffalo-based First Niagara Bank to sell 57 of the branches; First Niagara officially took over those branches on September 8, after the signs were changed over from National City during that year's Labor Day Weekend. The branches not purchased by First Niagara were the four in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, that PNC was still required to divest: one branch in Titusville was sold to The Farmer's National Bank of Emlenton, with the other three (one in Conneaut Lake, and the other two in Meadville, including the branch inside Wal-Mart) were sold to Marquette Savings Bank. Although employees at the branches being sold off were retained, there were still heavy layoffs at National City's headquarters in Cleveland. PNC originally stated that 5,800 employees would be laid off corporate-wide across the new organization. In actuality, over 15,000 employees were laid off, all of them from the previous National City, with PNC losing customer and deposit market share in the Cleveland area as a result. National City Bank had been the largest bank in the Cleveland market and held the largest deposit share of all of its competitors. After the PNC merger, crosstown rival KeyBank became the largest bank in Cleveland, gaining a significant share of deposits once held by National City; KeyBank would later buy First Niagara and move into PNC's home market of Pittsburgh with the former National City branches PNC had to sell off. The National City name lasted into 2010, since it would take PNC some time to integrate the two banks together. Despite the branch closures and the sale of others to First Niagara and Emclaire, PNC still ended up with a 46% market share in Pittsburgh, over three times the market share of second-place Citizens Financial Group, with 13%. PNC began to convert the National City branches that were not sold off or closed on November 7, 2009, starting with Pennsylvania (where the two had the most overlap), Florida, and the Youngstown & Steubenville, Ohio regions. The conversion of National City to PNC was completed in June 2010, in the following phases: *February 19, 2010 Central & Southern Ohio (including Cincinnati, Dayton, and the state capital of Columbus), Southeastern Indiana, and all of Kentucky. *April 12, 2010 Northern Ohio (including National City's home market of Cleveland, Akron, Canton, and Toledo) and all of Michigan. *June 14, 2010 The rest of Indiana and all of Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin.

Born in Blofield, Norfolk, Edrich came from a cricketing family, his four cousins, Eric Edrich, Bill Edrich, Geoff Edrich and Brian Edrich, all having played first-class cricket. He was educated at the private Bracondale School between the ages of eight and seventeen, during which time he played cricket at weekends and was coached by former cricketer C. S. R. Boswell. Edrich played for Surrey and England. He was renowned for playing the cut, the cover drive and scoring off his legs, earning over the years a reputation for dogged fearlessness. His statistical achievements show that he was amongst the best players of his generation, playing a total of seventy-seven Test matches for England between 1963 and 1976, and scoring a triple-century in 1965 that is the fifth highest Test score for England. A player during the time when One Day International cricket was in its infancy, he played, and top scored, in the first ever ODI match. The cricket writer Colin Bateman described him as \\"unflinching, unselfish, and often unsmiling while going about his business in the middle, he was a fiercely formidable opener who knew his limitations and worked wonderfully within them\\". Life and career Having played four first-class matches for Combined Services in 1956 and 1957, whilst doing his national service, Edrich made his first-class debut for Surrey in their final fixture of the 1958 season. The following year, he came to the fore, scoring 1,799 runs at an average of 52.91. Over the next four years he and Micky Stewart became a very effective opening partnership for the county, to the extent that both were called up for England for the Test series against the West Indies, who were dominating the sport at this time. Despite Edrich's strong performances for his county, he managed a total of only 108 Test runs in six innings facing bowlers including Hall, Sobers and Griffith. However, an opportunity to break back into the international side arose when Geoffrey Boycott was injured during Australia's tour of England in 1964. Edrich was called up to the side for the Second Test, at Lord's, and did not disappoint, scoring 120. The match ended in a draw due to rain.Cricketer of the Year, CricInfo. Retrieved on 10 August 2007. However, he was not selected for the 1964‚Äì65 tour of South Africa. Injuries to other players resulted in another recall to the England side for the Third Test against New Zealand at Headingley in July 1965, where he scored 310 not out. This innings spanned over eight hours, and included 52 fours and five sixes ‚Äì 238 runs or 77% of his innings.Edrich's epoch CricInfo. Retrieved on 8 August 2007 Commentators at the time said that he might have broken the existing Test record of 365 within another 90 minutes or so if his captain, Mike Smith, had not felt it necessary to declare the innings closed. However, a week later during the First Test against South Africa, he suffered a blow to the head from a short-pitched delivery by Peter Pollock. This was before helmets came into use, and he was forced to retire hurt on 7 not out.John Edrich's Cricket profile CricInfo. Retrieved on 29 July 2007 Wisden named Edrich as Cricketer of the Year in 1966 for his achievements in 1965, alongside Colin Bland, Dick Motz, Graeme Pollock and brother Peter Pollock. As well as his Test triple century, he had scored a total of 2,319 runs at an average of 62.67 during the season, including eight hundreds. At one stage, in nine successive innings he scored 139, 121*, 205*, 55, 96, 188, 92, 105 and 310*. Not previously known as a big hitter, he struck forty-nine sixes during the course of the season. John Edrich's Test career performance graph He had by now become an established member of the England batting line-up, rarely omitted unless injured. Beginning with the 1965‚Äì66 Ashes series, he sometimes batted at number three rather than, as hitherto, opening the innings. In the 1970‚Äì71 Ashes series his 687 runs (52.85) kept him at the crease for 33 hours and 26 minutes, a record for a Test series until broken by Glenn Turner against West Indies the next season. His form at this time helped England play 27 consecutive Tests without defeat in 1968‚Äì71, and lose only one Test out of 40 in 1966‚Äì71. Edrich played in the first-ever One Day International (ODI), on 5 January 1971 against Australia. After the Third Test had been called off due to rain, the umpires called for an unscheduled match, consisting of 40 eight- ball overs per side. Edrich top-scored with 82 runs, thus scoring the first half-century in an ODI, and won the first Man of the Match award in ODI history. The following summer, Surrey won the County Championship for the first time since 1958, with Edrich's batting being an important factor in the county's success. By now, Stewart had dropped down the order to number three, and Edrich had formed another successful opening partnership with Mike Edwards. Stewart retired after the 1972 season, and from 1973 to 1977 Edrich succeeded him as Surrey's captain. On the tour of Australia in 1974‚Äì75, his fortune regarding injuries did not improve. In the first Test a ball from aggressive pace bowler Dennis Lillee struck his hand and broke it, although he was able to continue batting. In the Fourth Test, the then captain Mike Denness dropped himself and Edrich was subsequently named as captain.\\"The Captain Who Dropped Himself\\" CricInfo. Retrieved on 30 July 2007 He had little luck in that game when Lillee broke his ribs with the first ball of his second innings, although he did recover to bat later on, scoring 33 runs. England lost the test, and it was to be his only appearance as captain.Egos battered, Bruised and Bewildered The Times. Retrieved 30 July 2007.Heads we lose The Guardian. Retrieved on 30 July 2007. During the 1977 county cricket season, Edrich scored his 100th first-class century, playing for Surrey against Derbyshire. In the same year he was appointed an MBE for services to cricket.

The company was formed in December 2019 as the result of the merger of BB&T; (Branch Banking and Trust Company) and SunTrust Banks. Its bank operates 2,049 branches in 15 states and Washington, D.C., and offers consumer and commercial banking, securities brokerage, asset management, mortgage, and insurance products and services. It is on the list of largest banks in the United States by assets. Its subsidiary, McGriff Insurance Services (formerly known as BB&T; Insurance Services), was one of the largest insurance brokers in the world. In its history, it has made 106 mergers and acquisitions. Since it took over Southern National Bank in 1995, it has made 43 deals. History=Beginnings In 1872, Alpheus Branch and Thomas Jefferson Hadley founded the Branch and Hadley merchant bank in their hometown of Wilson, North Carolina. After many transactions, mostly with local farmers, Branch bought out Hadley's shares in 1887 and renamed the company Branch and Company, Bankers. Two years later, Branch, his father-in-law Gen. Joshua Barnes, Hadley, and three other men secured a charter from the North Carolina General Assembly to operate the Wilson Banking and Trust Company. After many more name changes, the company finally settled on the name Branch Banking and Trust Company. Branch remained an active member of the company until his death in 1893. The 1903 Branch Banking and Trust Company Building at Wilson was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. BB&T; sold Liberty Bonds during World War I and grew to have more than $4 million in assets by 1923. BB&T; Insurance Services was added in 1922 and a mortgage division was added in 1923. Even though banks across the United States failed as a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash, BB&T; survived; it was the only one to do so in the town of Wilson. Merger with Southern National Bank In 1995, the bank merged with Southern National Bank, another bank with roots in the eastern part of the state. This gave BB&T; 437 branches in 220 cities in the Carolinas and Virginia. The bank name became BB&T;, though at first, the holding company was Southern National Corp. With $19 billion in assets, BB&T; had the most North Carolina deposits and branches of any bank.

He captained Derbyshire between 1955 and 1962, and scored over 10,000 runs for the county. His cricket administration roles included twelve years as assistant secretary to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), taking over as secretary of the fledgling Test and County Cricket Board in 1976. In his ten years in that role, cricket writer, Colin Bateman noted that Carr \\"mixed diplomacy with a sense of justice as first the Packer Affair, and then the first rebel tour to South Africa, threatened to split the world game\\". Life and career Carr was the son of John Carr, an officer of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, who was serving with the British Army of the Rhine in Germany. He went to Forres Boarding School in Swanage (the headmaster, R. M. Chadwick, a former opening bat for Dorset Minor Counties 1st XI, coached him) and then to Repton School, where his father had taken the post of bursar. Already an above average boy cricketer, he developed into one of the best young all-rounders under the coaching of Lionel Blaxland and Garnet Lee. In 1944 his last year at Repton, he captained The Rest against the Lord's Schools and the Public Schools' side against a Lord's XI.Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1960 ‚Äì Donald Carr Carr joined the Army on 1 January 1945, and was sent to Northern Ireland, where he had little scope to play serious cricket. In the summer he went to Wrotham for a training course and was chosen, on the withdrawal of George Pope, for England in the third Victory Test match against Australia at Lord's. He went to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and gained a Commission in the Royal Berkshire Regiment in February 1946. In the 1946 season he first played for Derbyshire in the County Championship. He made his debut against Kent, when he scored a duck in his only innings in a drawn match, but took two wickets. He also played for Combined Services. Carr did not play first-class cricket in 1947, as he was serving in Burma, but left the army in April 1948 and went to Worcester College, Oxford. He played in the County Championship for Derbyshire in the 1948 season and, in 1949, made the Oxford University team. He also finished off the season playing for Derbyshire in the 1949 season when he scored 1,210 runs and hit three centuries, with his career top score 170 for Oxford University against Leicestershire. In 1950, he captained Oxford, and took six for 39 against Lancashire. In his final year at Oxford his 34 and 50 helped defeat Cambridge by 21 runs in the Varsity match, and he also headed the Derbyshire Championship averages in the 1951 season. After university, Carr went to work for a Midlands brewery, but before starting he was given permission to tour as vice-captain to Nigel Howard in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team in India, Pakistan and Ceylon. He played in two Test matches against India in 1951‚Äì52. In the first, at Delhi, England were in a desperate situation until he and Allan Watkins stayed together for just over five hours and added 158 to save the game. He was captain in Howard's absence in the second of those Tests, which was the first time England lost to India, leaving the series drawn at 1‚Äì1. In his Test career he played four innings in two matches at an average of 33.75, and a highest score of 76. He took two Test wickets for the loss of 140 runs. He captained an MCC \\"A\\" side in Pakistan in 1955-56. He had been in the same Oxford side in 1949 as his opposing captain, Abdul Hafeez Kardar. He upset Kardar by joking that his nickname at Oxford, \\"the Mystic of the East\\", had been mistranslated as \\"the Mistake of the East\\". During the third unofficial Test at Peshawar, Carr and two other England players carried out a prank on the umpire Idris Baig, who had given several decisions that the England side regarded as poor, soaking him with water. Baig took this good-naturedly, but Hafeez decided to treat it as an insult to the pride of Pakistan. MCC offered to cancel the tour and subsequently held Carr responsible for the incident, something that he had already accepted.Daily Telegraph obituary Retrieved 23 June 2016 Carr scored 2,292 runs at an average of more than 44 runs an innings in the 1959 season, and was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1960. Carr played 745 innings on 446 first-class matches, with an average of 28.61 and a top score of 170. He took 328 first- class wickets at an average of 34.74, and a best performance of 7 for 53.Donald Carr at Cricket Archive Carr represented Oxford University at football, and played in the FA Amateur Cup final twice for the winning Pegasus side in 1951 and 1953.

The festival is marked with the installation of Ganesh clay idols privately in homes, or publicly on elaborate pandals (temporary stages). Observations include chanting of Vedic hymns and Hindu texts such as, prayers and brata (fasting). Offerings and prasadam from the daily prayers, that are distributed from the pandal to the community, include sweets such as modaka as it is believed to be a favourite of Lord Ganesh. The festival ends on the tenth day after start, when the idol is carried in a public procession with music and group chanting, then immersed in a nearby body of water such as a river or sea. In Mumbai alone, around 150,000 statues are immersed annually. Thereafter the clay idol dissolves and Ganesh is believed to return to Mount Kailash to Parvati and Shiva.Ganesh Chaturthi: Hindu Festival, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2014) The festival celebrates Lord Ganesh as the God of New Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles as well as the god of wisdom and intelligence and is observed throughout India, especially in the states such as Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, West Bengal, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, and is celebrated privately at home in Tamil Nadu in 2020 due to Covid-19 Pandemic. Ganesh Chaturthi is also observed in Nepal and by the Hindu diaspora elsewhere such as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, other parts of the Caribbean, Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa United States, and Europe. In the Gregorian calendar, Ganesh Chaturthi falls between 22 August and 20 September every year. At public venues, along with the reading of texts and group feasting, athletic and martial arts competitions are also held.  History  Ganesha, Basohli miniature, circa 1730. Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak, championed it as a means to circumvent the colonial British government ban on Hindu gatherings through its anti-public assembly legislation in 1892. Ganesh Though not alluding to the classical form of Ganapati, the earliest mention of Ganapati is found in the Rigveda.

Madras: The Adyar Library, pp. 110‚Äì11 However, it is uncertain that the Vedic term Ganapati which literally means \\"guardian of the multitudes\\", referred specifically to later era Ganesh, nor do the Vedic texts mention Ganesh Chaturthi. appears in post-Vedic texts such as the Grhya Sutras and thereafter ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Vajasaneyi Samhita, the Yajnavalkya Smriti and the Mahabharata mention Ganapati as Ganesvaras and Vinayak. Ganesh appears in the medieval Puranas in the form of \\"god of success, obstacle remover\\". The Skanda Purana, Narada Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, in particular, profusely praise him. Beyond textual interpretations, archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest Ganesh had become popular, was revered before the 8th century CE and numerous images of him are traceable to the 7th century or earlier. Ganesh idol in Khairatabad, Hyderabad, India For example, carvings at Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples such as at the Ellora Caves, dated between the 5th and 8th-century show Ganesh reverentially seated with major Hindu goddess (Shakti).  Festival  Although it is unknown when (or how) Ganesh Chaturthi was first observed, the festival has been publicly celebrated in Pune since the era of Shivaji (1630‚Äì1680, founder of the Maratha Empire). After the start of the British Raj, the Ganesh festival lost state patronage and became a private family celebration in Maharashtra until its revival by Indian freedom fighter and social reformer Lokmanya Tilak. > I followed with the greatest curiosity crowds who carried in procession an > infinite number of idols of the god Ganesh.

A crowd, more or less > numerous, accompanies the idol, clapping hands and raises cries of joy, > while a little orchestra generally precedes the idol. > ‚Äì Angelo de Gubernatis, Bombay Gazette (1886) According to others such as Kaur, the festival became a public event later, in 1892 when Bhausaheb Laxman Javale (also known as Bhau Rangari), installed the first sarvajanik (public) Ganesh idol in Pune.Kaur, R. (2003). Performative politics and the cultures of Hinduism: Public uses of religion in western India. Anthem Press, pp. 38‚Äì48. In 1893, the Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak praised the celebration of Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav in his newspaper, Kesari, and dedicated his efforts to launch the annual domestic festival into a large, well-organised public event., Metcalf and Metcalf, p. 150. Tilak recognised Ganesh's appeal as \\"the god for everybody\\",Momin, A.R., The Legacy of G. S. Ghurye: A Centennial Festschrift, p. 95. and according to Robert Brown, he chose Ganesh as the god that bridged \\"the gap between Brahmins and non-Brahmins\\", thereby building a grassroots unity across them to oppose British colonial rule. Other scholars state that the British Empire, after 1870 out of fear of seditious assemblies, had passed a series of ordinances that banned public assembly for social and political purposes of more than 20 people in British India, but exempted religious assembly for Friday mosque prayers under pressure from the Indian Muslim community. Tilak believed that this effectively blocked the public assembly of Hindus whose religion did not mandate daily prayers or weekly gatherings, and he leveraged this religious exemption to make Ganesh Chaturthi to circumvent the British colonial law on large public assembly. He was the first to install large public images of Ganesh in pavilions in Bombay Presidency, and other celebratory events at the festival.For Tilak as the first to use large public images in ' (pavilions or tents) see: Thapan, p. 225. According to Richard Cashman, Tilak recruited and passionately committed himself to god Ganesh after the 1893 Hindu-Muslim communal violence in Bombay and the Deccan riots, when he felt that the British India government under Lord Harris had repeatedly taken sides and not treated Hindus fairly because Hindus were not well organised. In Tilak's estimate, Ganesh worship and processions were already popular in rural and urban Hindu populations, across social castes and classes in Baroda, Gwalior, Pune and most of the Maratha region in the 18th century. In 1893, Tilak helped expand Ganesh Chaturthi festival into a mass community event and a hidden means for political activism, intellectual discourse, poetry recitals, plays, concerts, and folk dances. In Goa, Ganesh Chaturthi predates the Kadamba era. The Goa Inquisition had banned Hindu festivals, and Hindus who did not convert to Christianity were severely restricted. However, Hindu Goans continued to practice their religion despite the restrictions. Many families worship Ganesh in the form of patri (leaves used for worshiping Ganesh or other gods), a picture is drawn on paper or small silver idols. In some households Ganesh idols are hidden, a feature unique to Ganesh Chaturthi in Goa due to a ban on clay Ganes idols and festivals by the Jesuits as part of the Inquisition. Artist preparing Ganesh's image for the festival in Margao, Goa The Laalbaaghcha Raja (the most renowned version of Ganesh in Mumbai) in procession. Public preparations for the festivities begin months in advance. Local Mandapa or Pandal's are usually funded either from donations by local residents or hosted by businesses or community organisations. The making of the Murti in Maharashtra usually begins with \\"Padya pooja\\" or worshipping the feet of Lord Ganesh. The Murti's are brought to \\"pandals\\" on the day or a day before the festival begins. The pandals have elaborate decoration and lighting. At home, the festival preparation includes purchases such as puja items or accessories a few days in advance and booking the Ganesh murti as early as a month beforehand (from local artisans). The murti is brought home either a day before or on the day of the Ganesh Chaturthi itself. Families decorate a small, clean portion of the house with flowers and other colourful items before installing the idol. When the Murti is installed, it and its shrine are decorated with flowers and other materials. On the day of the festival, The ceremonial installation of the clay murti (idol) is done along with chants of holy mantras and pooja including bhajans during a certain auspicious period of the day. In preparation for the festival, artisans create clay models of Ganesh for sale. The Murti's range in size from for homes to over for large community celebrations. The date for the festival is usually decided by the presence of Chaturthi Thithi. The festival is held during \\"Bhadrapada Madyahanaa Purvabaddha\\". If the Chaturthi Thiti begins at night on the previous day and gets over by morning on next day then the next day is observed as Vinayaka Chaturthi. In the consecration ceremony, a priest performs a Prana Pratishtha to invite Ganesh like a guest. This is followed by the 16-step Shodashopachara ritual, (Sanskrit: Shodash, 16; Upachara, process) during which coconut, jaggery, modaks, durva grass and red hibiscus (Jaswand) flowersKolte, R.R., Kulkarni, R.S., Shinde, P.V., Padvekar, H.K., Magadum, V.G. and Apate, S.A., Studies on the ethnomedicinal plants used on the occasion of festivals with special reference to Ratnagiri district from Maharashtra state . are offered to the idol. Depending on the region and time zone, the ceremony commences with hymns from the Rigveda, the Ganapati Atharvashirsa, the Upanishads and the Ganesh stotra (prayer) from the Narada Purana are chanted. In Maharashtra as well as Goa, Aartis are performed with friends and family, typically in the morning and evening.  Visarjan  On the last day of the festival, the tradition of Ganesh Visarjan takes place. The concluding day of the 10-day festival is also popularly known as Anant Chaturdashi. As the word 'visarjan' implies, on this day immersion ('visarjan' means immersion) of Lord Ganapati's idol takes place in a river, sea or water body. On the last day, the devotees come out in processions carrying the idols of their beloved God and perform immersion. There is an interesting story behind the legend of Ganesh visarjan. It is believed that Lord Ganesha returns to Mount Kailash to join his parents Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati on the last day of the festival. The celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi also denotes the significance of the cycle of birth, life and death. Ganesha, who is also known as the Lord of New Beginnings, is also worshipped as the Remover of Obstacles. It is believed that when the idol of the Ganesha is taken out for immersion, it also takes away with it the various obstacles of the house and these obstacles are destroyed along with the visarjan. Every year, people wait with great anticipation to celebrate the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi. Celebration in India  In India, Ganesh Chaturthi is primarily celebrated at home and in public by local community groups in the central and western states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Goa and the southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and eastern states of West Bengal and Odisha.. At prominent temples At Varasidhi Vinayaka Swamy Temple in Kanipakam, Andhra Pradesh, annual brahmotsavams will be celebrated for 21 days starting from Vinayaka Chavithi day. The processional deity of Vinayaka (Ganesh) will be taken in a procession on different vahanams on these days amidst large number of pilgrims across the country. At home A domestic celebration of Ganesh during Ganesh Chaturthi in a Maharashtrian home In Maharashtra, Ganesh Chaturthi is known as Ganeshotsav. Families install small clay statues for worship during the festival. The Murti is worshiped in the morning and evening with offerings of flowers, durva(strands of young grass), karanji and modaks (jaggery and coconut flakes wrapped in rice flour dumplings). The worship ends with the singing of an aarti in honour of Ganesh, other Gods and Saints. In Maharashtra the Marathi aarti \\"Sukhakarta Dukhaharta\\", composed by the 17th century saint, Samarth Ramdas is sung. Family traditions differ about when to end the celebration. Domestic celebrations end after , 3, 5, 7 or 11 days. At that time the Murti is ceremoniously brought to a body of water (such as a lake, river or the sea) for immersion. In Maharashtra, Ganeshotsav also incorporates other festivals, namely Hartalika and the Gauri festival, the former is observed with a fast by women on the day before Ganesh Chaturthi whilst the latter by the installation of statues of Gauris. In some communities such as the Chitpavan, and the CKP, pebbles collected from river bank are installed as representations of Gauri. In Goa, Ganesh Chaturthi is known as Chavath in Konkani and Parab or Parva (\\"auspicious celebration\\"); it begins on the third day of the lunar month of Bhadrapada. On this day Parvati and Shiva are worshiped by women, who fast. Instruments such as ghumots, Crash cymbals (‡§§‡§æ‡§≥(taal) in Konkani) and pakhavaj (an Indian barrel-shaped, two-headed drum) are played during the rituals. The harvest festival, Navyachi Pancham, is celebrated the next day; freshly harvested paddy is brought home from the fields (or temples) and a puja is conducted. Communities who ordinarily eat seafood refrain from doing so during the festival. In Karnataka the Gowri festival precedes Ganesh Chaturthi, and people across the state wish each other well. In Andhra Pradesh, Ganesh Murti'so of clay (Matti Vinayakudu) and turmeric (Siddhi Vinayakudu) are usually worshiped at home with plaster of Paris Murti's. Ganesh Visarjan in 200px 200px Public celebrations of the festival are popular, and are organised by local youth groups, neighbourhood associations or groups of tradespeople. Funds for the public festival are collected from members of the association arranging the celebration, local residents and businesses.Courtright, P.B. (1988). \\"The Ganesh Festival in Maharashtra: Some Observations\\". The Experience of Hinduism: Essays on Religion in Maharashtra, 84‚Äì86. The Ganesh idols and accompanying statues are installed in temporary shelters, known as mandaps or pandals. The festival features cultural activities such as singing, theatre and orchestral performances and community activities such as free medical checkups, blood- donation sites and donations to the poor. Ganesh Chaturthi, in addition to its religious aspects, is an important economic activity in Mumbai, Surat, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai and Kurnool. Many artists, industries, and businesses earn a significant amount of their living from the festival, which is a stage for budding artists. Members of other religions also participate in the celebration. In Tamil Nadu, the festival, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi or Pillayar Chaturthi, falls on the fourth day after the new moon in the month of ƒÄva·πái in the Tamil calendar. The idols are usually made of clay or papier- m√¢ch√©, since Plaster of Paris idols have been banned by the state government, but violations of this rule are often reported Idols are also made of coconuts and other organic products. They are worshiped for several days in pandals, and immersed in the Bay of Bengal the following Sunday. In Kerala the festival is also known as Lamboodhara Piranalu, which falls in the month of Chingam. In Thiruvananthapuram a procession marches from the Pazhavangadi Ganapathi Temple to Shankumugham Beach, with tall statues of Ganesha made from organic items and milk immersed in the sea. Celebration outside India Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Antwerp, Belgium Ganesh Chaturthi celebration by the Sri Lankan Tamil community in France In Pakistan, Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations are conducted by the Shri Maharashtra Panchayat, an organisation for Maharashtrians in Karachi. Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in the UK by the British Hindu population living there. The Hindu Culture and Heritage Society, a Southall-based organisation, celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi for the first time in London in 2005 at the Vishwa Hindu Temple; and the idol was immersed in the River Thames at Putney Pier. Another celebration, organised by a Gujarati group, has been celebrated in Southend-on-Sea, and attracted an estimated 18,000 devotees. Annual celebrations are also held on the River Mersey in Liverpool. The Philadelphia Ganesh Festival is one of the most popular celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi in North America, and it is also celebrated in Canada (particularly in the Toronto area), Mauritius, Malaysia and Singapore. The Mauritius festival dates back to 1896, and the Mauritian government has made it a public holiday. In Malaysia and Singapore, the festival is more commonly known as Vinayagar Chaturthi because of the large Tamil-speaking Hindu minority.  Foods  The primary sweet dish during the festival is Modak (modak in Marathi and Konkani, modakam or kudumu in Telugu, modaka or kadubu in Kannada, kozhakatta or modakkam in Malayalam and kozhukattai or modagam in Tamil). A modak is a dumpling made from rice or wheat flour, stuffed with grated coconut, [jaggery], dried fruits and other condiments and steamed or fried. Another popular sweet dish is the karanji (karjikai in Kannada), similar to modak in composition and taste but in a semicircular shape. This sweet meal is called Nevri in Goa and is synonymous with Ganesh festival amongst the Goans and the Konkani diaspora. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana modak, laddu, vundrallu (steamed, coarsely ground rice- flour balls), panakam (a jaggery-, black pepper- and cardamom-flavoured drink), vadapappu (soaked moong lentils) and chalividi (a cooked rice flour and jaggery mixture) are offered to Ganesh. These offerings are known as naivedya, and a plate of modak traditionally holds 21 pieces of the sweet. In Goa, modak and a Goan version of idli (sanna) is popular. Panchakajjaya is an offering made to Lord Ganesh during this festival in parts of Karnataka. It is a mixture of desiccated coconut, roasted Bengal gram powder, sugar, ghee, and sesame. Different versions of panchakajjaya are made. Roasted Bengal gram, green gram, roasted chana dal (putani) or aval can be used.Ferro-Luzzi, G.E., 1977. \\"The logic of South Indian food offerings\\". Anthropos, (H. 3./4), pp. 529‚Äì56.  Environmental impact  The Madras High Court ruled in 2004 that immersion of Ganesh idols is unlawful because it incorporates chemicals that pollute the sea water. In Goa the sale of plaster-of-Paris Ganesha idols has been banned by the state government and celebrants are encouraged to buy traditional, artisan-made clay idols. Recent initiatives to produce traditional clay Ganesh idols in Hyderabad have been sponsored by the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board.Now more people are opting for clay/cow dung or other Vedic based Ganesh Idols. Due to environmental concerns, a number of families now avoid bodies of water and let the clay statue disintegrate in a barrel of water at home. After a few days, the clay is spread in the garden. In some cities a public, eco-friendly process is used for the immersion.

Train services are provided by South Western Railway, with direct trains running to Guildford, Aldershot, Alton, Woking, Surbiton, Clapham Junction and London Waterloo. Trains are formed of modern electric multiple units. Steam trains and freight trains are seen quite often, travelling from/to the Watercress Line and Holybourne oil terminal. There is a buffet in the booking hall selling newspapers, hot and cold beverages, confectionery, snacks, hot food and tobacco products. The station parking has been expanded with an additional 134 spaces with the addition of a dual level car park facility, including additional lighting, security cameras and improved entrance.  History  The station was opened on 8 October 1849, on a route from Guildford via Ash Green and Tongham. The line from Aldershot station opened in 1870 and was electrified on 4 July 1937. Passenger services via Ash Green Halt and Tongham ceased on the same date.  Farnham station in fiction = Sherlock Holmes  Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson travelled by train to Farnham in \\"The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\\". Holmes said, \\"A beautiful neighbourhood and full of the most interesting associations. You remember, Watson, that it was near there that we took Archie Stamford, the forger.\\" Watson recounted, \\"We had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the Monday by the train which leaves Waterloo at 9.50, so I started early and caught the 9:13.\\" He did this on Monday, 25 April 1895. Holmes himself travelled to Farnham the next day, returning to Baker Street \\"late in the evening with a cut lip and a discoloured lump upon his forehead, besides a general air of dissipation which would have made his own person the fitting object of a Scotland Yard investigation\\". Sherlock Holmes, as a young boy, also lives in the Farnham area with his aunt and uncle in Andrew Lane's Young Sherlock Holmes series of books. The station features prominently as Holmes, his friend, and his tutor often travel by train to London Waterloo when they are going to visit Holmes's brother Mycroft Holmes.  Services  The typical off-peak service (Monday to Saturday) from the station is of two trains per hour to London Waterloo, and two per hour to Alton. There are also two trains per hour to Guildford. Buses Stagecoach Buses routes 5; 17; 18; 19; and 46 serve the station.

Solomon was a son of Alexander V of Imereti by his second wife Tamar n√©e Abashidze and succeeded upon his father's death in 1752. He immediately launched a series of stringent measures against the renegade nobles and slave trade from which they profited in conjunction with the Ottoman authorities. In 1752, the aristocratic opposition staged a coup, but Solomon quickly regained the crown and began a program of reforms aimed at stabilizing the kingdom torn apart by chronic civil wars. The Ottomans, which saw Imereti as the sphere of their influence, sent in an army, but Solomon succeeded in mobilizing his nobles around him and defeated the invaders at the Battle of Khresili in 1757. The same year, he forged an alliance with his kinsman, Heraclius II, who ruled in eastern Georgia. He defeated two more Ottoman invasions (20,000 strong and 13,000 strong). The Ottoman instigated invasion of North Caucasus tribes, one of which succeeded, while second one was thwarted. Briefly, Ottomans took Kutaisi in 1765 and placed his cousin, Teimuraz on the throne. In 1767, Solomon managed to stage a comeback, and freed Imereti of Turks again. Next year, another Russo-Turkish broke out, and in May 1769, Solomon traveled to Tbilisi to meet with Heraclius II. The two kings decided to request five Russian regiments and join the war with the Ottoman Empire in exchange of the guarantee that Georgian interests would be protected in the final Russo-Turkish peace deal. The Russians sent a small force under General Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben, but the general's rudeness and condescension alienated the Georgians; Totleben was quickly recalled from Georgia. After the war was over, Solomon was able to force his autonomist vassals, princes of Mingrelia and Guria, into submission, and continued antagonizing the Ottoman hegemony in the region. Ottomans had no choice but to sign a treaty with Imereti, by which Imeterti was no longer Ottoman vassal, slave trade was not even mentioned, with symbolic tribute of 60 women annually (did not stipulate them to be Georgians, and Solomon never honored this clause anyway). He crushed the Ottoman-sponsored insurrection in Abkhazia in 1779, and made a series of forays into the Turkish-controlled southwestern historic Georgian lands. He died in March 1784 and was buried at the Gelati Monastery. He was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church on 22 December 2016, his feast day set for 23 April (NS 10 April). Solomon I was married three times; first, to Princess Tinatin Shervashidze, second to Princess Mariam, daughter of Otia Dadiani (died 1778), Prince of Mingrelia, and third, Princess Gulkan Tsulukidze (1730‚Äì1800).

In the only four Test matches he played in, England won one and drew three, although the series was tied after the Fifth Test was lost (Howard was ill and Donald Carr captained England in his absence). Howard was chosen to lead the side to the sub- continent largely because he was the best available amateur (Len Hutton became the first professional England captain of the 20th century a few months later) and a successful leader of Lancashire (1949‚Äì53). Youth and early career Howard's younger brother Barry, also played for Lancashire, and their father Rupert was secretary of Lancashire County Cricket Club for several years. Howard went to Rossall School and played for Rossall Cricket Club. He showed early promise, leading his club's averages for the 1941 and 1942 seasons while still in his teens. As well as performing well at cricket, Howard was also a capable golfer and hockey player, representing Cheshire in both sports. Retrieved on 21 December 2008.

He was born as David to Prince Archil of Imereti, brother of King Solomon I of Imereti, by his wife Helene, daughter of King Heraclius II of Georgia. Solomon I, who died in 1784 without a male heir, named his nephew David as his successor. However, Solomon's cousin David II prevented him, and another rival prince, from being crowned as king and occupied the throne, leading to a civil war. Heraclius II interfered on behalf of his grandson and sent in an army, defeating David II at the Battle of Matkhoji on June 11, 1789. David, son of Archil, was crowned as King of Imereti under the name of Solomon II, but David II continued his efforts to resume the throne until his final defeat in 1792. He ruled under the protection of his maternal grandfather, Heraclius II, and continued Solomon I's policy of restricting the powers of feudal aristocracy. In 1795, he and Heraclius fought with a small Imeretian force at the Battle of Krtsanisi against the Persians, only to be completely defeated by the latter. After Heraclius' death in 1798, and the annexation of the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (east of Imereti) by Russia in 1800, the situation in Imereti became precarious. His refractory vassals, princes of Mingrelia and Guria (west of Imereti), assumed the Russian protection and put forward territorial claims to the royal domains. Solomon attempted to enlist Ottoman and Persian support against the anticipated Russian encroachment. However, the Russian commander in Georgia, Prince Pavel Tsitsianov, moved his army into Imereti and forced Solomon to succumb to Russian vassalage in the convention of Elaznauri of April 25, 1804. Yet, Solomon's relations with Russia continued to be strained. On February 20, 1810, the Russian administration removed Solomon from the throne and sent in troops to take control of the kingdom. Solomon retaliated by rallying people against Russia and tried to enlist Turkey, Persia and Napoleonic France in his cause.

In 1930 he invented the Schmidt telescope which corrected for the optical errors of spherical aberration, coma, and astigmatism, making possible for the first time the construction of very large, wide-angled reflective cameras of short exposure time for astronomical research. Childhood Schmidt was the son of Carl Constantin and Marie Helene Christine ( Rosen) Schmidt. He was born and grew up on the island of Nargen (Naissaar), off the coast of Reval (Tallinn), Estonia, then part of the Russian Empire. The inhabitants of this island, mainly Estonian Swedes, generally spoke Swedish or Estonian, but the Schmidt family also spoke German. Bernhard was the oldest of six children, three boys (one of whom died in infancy) and three girls. Naissaar was a small, rural island whose population mainly supported themselves through fishing and piloting ships into the port of Reval. With his younger brother August Fredrik, Bernhard Schmidt engaged in many childhood adventures on the island. He was an extremely inquisitive, inventive, and imaginative young person and adult. For example, when young he built his own camera from a purchased lens and old concertina bellows and succeeded in photographing his local surroundings and various family members, and even sold some of his photos. He also became fascinated with the night sky and constellations. One misadventure proved tragic and marked Schmidt for the rest of his life. When he was 15 years old, he experimented with gunpowder. He packed an iron pipe with a charge, but through a mistake with the fuse the pipe exploded, and he lost the thumb and index finger of his right hand. Despite his mother's attempts to clean and bandage the wounds, surgeons in Tallinn later amputated the whole hand. This event appears to have deepened his reserve and introspection, qualities well noted by his contemporaries in later life. Youth In spite of his loss, Schmidt was soon experimenting and inventing again. He also took more photos and became adept at developing and printing them. In 1895 he moved to Tallinn, and for a time worked at retouching photographs. Later he worked for the Volta Electrical Motor Works and became skilled in drafting. In 1901 he went to Gothenburg, Sweden, to study at the Chalmers University of Technology, but soon thereafter switched to the University of Mittweida in the Kingdom of Saxony to further his education. Adulthood During this period his interest in astronomy and optics increased. In Mittweida he had hoped to study with Dr. Karl Strehl, a noted optical theorist. Strehl, however, had recently departed. Gradually, Schmidt found his true calling, namely the grinding and polishing of highly precise optics for astronomical applications. He seems to have begun the grinding of mirrors sometime around 1901, and thereafter began to sell some of his products to amateur astronomers. By March 1904, he had made so much progress in his new endeavor that after finishing his studies, he was soon in contact with professionals at the major observatories in Germany. His business rapidly took off when noted astronomers such as Hermann Carl Vogel, and Karl Schwarzschild realized the excellence of Schmidt's mirrors for their researches. Mittweida years Between 1904 and 1914, Schmidt's business boomed and he acquired an immense reputation in Germany. Not only did he produce some of the most difficult and precise mirrors ever attempted up to that time, but he was entrusted with correcting and improving lenses originally supplied by famous optical houses, for example the 50 cm Steinheil visual refractor at the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory. As his business increased, he hired several assistants, two of whom have left valuable accounts of Schmidt's working methods. Schmidt also bought an automobile, a rare luxury then, and employed a friend as chauffeur. Using a long focus horizontal mirror and a plane coelostat, both of his own manufacture, he took impressive photos of the sun, moon, and major planets. When one considers that he did much of the fabrication literally using just one hand, it is difficult not to be astonished at Schmidt's skill. World War I brought the boom to an end. Schmidt was arrested as an enemy-alien, as Estonia belonged to the Russian Empire, and was sent to an internment camp for about six months. After his release, he remained under police control and some of his suspicious- looking astronomical equipment was confiscated. He attempted to continue his business, but as the war dragged on and turned to defeat for Germany, the economy became grim and scientists had no money for astronomy. The situation did not improve after the war because of the political turmoil in Germany and the need to pay war reparations. Inflation galloped out of control in 1923 and many people lost their entire savings. By the mid-1920s, Schmidt's business was ruined and he had to liquidate his remaining equipment as junk. Bergedorf Schmidt Museum at Hamburg Observatory, Bergedorf From 1916 onward Schmidt had been in contact with Professor Richard Schorr, the director of the Hamburg Observatory, a facility located outside Hamburg in the countryside near the village of Bergedorf. Schorr had become interested in Schmidt's horizontal mirror and coelostat telescope and ordered one to be built for his observatory. After the war when Schmidt's economic situation became increasingly difficult, Schmidt began making overtures to Schorr for some kind of work at the observatory. Schorr had only a little to offer: Schmidt could come to Bergedorf and lodge for free; there was repair work to do on the horizontal telescope, for which he would be paid a small fee. This was in 1926. For a time Schmidt did not accept. He had a number of patents to his credit, one of which involved using a wind-driven propeller to power boats forward. Schmidt hoped to turn this invention into something profitable. He also went back to Estonia for a family visit and to scout out opportunities in optics, as Estonia had become an independent republic after World War I. Nothing came of these efforts, and by 1927 Schmidt's prospects were so poor that he accepted Schorr's offer. He began to establish a workshop in the basement of the Main Service Building at the observatory and to repair the horizontal telescope. During 1927 and 1929, Schmidt participated in two solar eclipse expeditions mounted by the Hamburg Observatory, the first to northern Sweden and the second to the Philippines. It was during this second trip that Schmidt announced to his companion, the astronomer Walter Baade, the most important invention of Schmidt's lifetime, indeed an invention that revolutionized astronomy and optical design in the second half of the 20th century, namely his wide-angle reflective camera. The Schmidt camera Astronomers had long wished for a way to photograph large swathes of the sky quickly for the purpose of surveying the visible contents of the universe and seeing large-scale structures. Ordinary telescopes up till Schmidt's time showed narrow fields of view, typically measuring 1 or 2 degrees in diameter. Surveying the whole sky with such telescopes required an enormous investment of time and resources over years and (because of the narrow views) tended to miss large structures. It was possible to see large swathes with small camera lenses, but then faint (and hence far away) objects would remain invisible. What was needed was large aperture cameras possessing wide fields of good imaging properties (\\"definition\\"), and fast focal ratios to decrease exposure times. Unfortunately, the only large aperture wide-field telescopes before Schmidt were ordinary reflecting telescopes of short focal ratio (about f/3), and these presented images which while sharp at the middle of their fields of view, quickly lost their definition away from the field center. Star images became bloated and comet-shaped, with the head of the \\"comet\\" pointing to the middle of the photographic field. This bloating results mainly from the optical aberrations (i.e. errors) called \\"coma\\" and \\"astigmatism\\". Before Schmidt it was impossible to build a large, fast reflector telescope which was not plagued by these errors. Schmidt was well aware of this and had been pondering possible solutions during the late 1920s. According to Baade, he had abandoned at least one solution already, when finally he hit upon his ultimate design, which involved a novel, indeed bold departure from traditional optical designs. Schmidt realized that by employing a large spherically shaped mirror (instead of the normal paraboloidal mirror of a reflector telescope) and a smaller apertured diaphragm placed at the center of curvature of the mirror, he could at a stroke eliminate coma and astigmatism. He would be left, however, with spherical aberration which is just as damaging to image sharpness. Schmidt realized that he could eliminate the spherical aberration by placing a thin, very weakly curved aspheric lens (now called the \\"Schmidt corrector plate\\") at the same center of curvature as the apertured diaphragm. This aspheric lens has a complex curve that is convex near its middle and concave near its periphery that creates the opposite spherical aberration of the spherical mirror it is paired with, canceling out the mirror's spherical aberration. In this way, very neatly and simply he could construct a large camera of f/1.75 or even faster, that would give sharp images across a field more than 15 degrees in diameter, making it possible to image large swathes of sky with short exposures (on the order of a few minutes versus an hour or more with a conventional reflector). His first camera had an aperture of about 360 mm or 14.5\\" in diameter, and a focal ratio of f/1.75. It is now housed in a museum at the Hamburg Observatory. Schmidt's combining of diverse optical elements (a special mirror, a diaphragm at a particular location, and a \\"correction plate\\") into a simple catadioptric system, based on reasoning from first principles, was epoch making. In particular, the \\"correction plate\\" was like nothing ever seen before in telescope design. After Schmidt a flood of new catadioptric designs appeared in the subsequent decades. Last years Schmidt built his first \\"Schmidtspiegel\\" (which came to be known as the Schmidt camera) in 1930, a breakthrough which caused a sensation around the world. He employed a very clever method (the so-called \\"vacuum pan\\" method) to make the difficult \\"corrector plate\\", so that the system gave superb images. The vacuum pan involved carefully warping a parallel glass plate under partial vacuum into a slight sagging curve and then polishing the upper curve flat. After release of the vacuum, the lens would spring back into the \\"Schmidt shape\\" needed for the camera. No one had ever made a lens in this way before. Schmidt published a brief account (in German) of his invention in professional publications, and offered to build his cameras for professional observatories. Unfortunately, his publicity was too little and his design was too novel. Moreover, the invention coincided with the beginning of the Great Depression. No orders came in and he remained dependent on Schorr and Bergedorf for a modest income from occasional jobs till the end of his life. He produced a larger camera in 1934 and reground the 60 cm Bergedorf-Steinheil photographic refractor as well. Schmidt fell ill at the end of November 1935 after a business trip to Leiden in the Netherlands. Despite attempts at treatment, he died on 1 December 1935 in Hamburg at the age of 56. An autopsy revealed that he was suffering from a lung infection. Personal life and legacy The 2m Schmidt Camera (the Alfred-Jensch Telescope at Karl Schwarzschild Observatory in Tautenburg, Germany). Schmidt did not marry and had no children. Soon after his death, through the advocacy of Walter Baade when he arrived at the Mount Wilson Observatory in the United States, the Schmidt telescope idea took off. An 18\\" Schmidt was produced in 1936 and then twelve years later, the famous 48\\" (122 cm) Samuel Oschin telescope Schmidt-telescope was built at Mount Palomar Observatory. This last telescope produced a flood of new observations and information. It proved the brilliance of the Schmidt concept beyond doubt. Subsequently at Bergedorf in 1955 a large, well-constructed Schmidt was dedicated. The 2-meter Schmidt telescope of the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory was built later and remains the largest Schmidt camera in the world, although more technologically advanced versions have since been produced. The Bergedorf Schmidt was moved to Calar Alto Observatory in 1976. Bernhard Schmidt is also the protagonist of the biographic novel Vastutuulelaev: Bernhard Schmidti romaan (Sailing Against the Wind: a Novel of Bernhard Schmidt) by Estonian author Jaan Kross.

It was reused for the 1930 opera Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny and has been recorded by the Doors and David Bowie. Original version The \\"Alabama Song\\" was written as a German poem and translated into idiosyncratic English for the author Bertolt Brecht by his close collaborator Elisabeth Hauptmann in 1925 and published in Brecht's 1927 Home Devotions (), a parody of Martin Luther's collection of sermons. It was set to music by Kurt Weill for the 1927 play Little Mahagonny (') and reused for Brecht and Weill's 1930 opera Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny ('), where it is sung by Jenny and her fellow prostitutes in Act I. Although the majority of all three works is in German, the \\"Alabama Song\\" retained Hauptmann's broken English lyrics throughout. Brecht and Weill's version of the song was first performed by the Viennese actress and dancer Lotte Lenya, Weill's wife,. in the role of Jessie at the 1927 Baden-Baden Festival's performance of Little Mahagonny. The first recording of the song‚Äîby Lenya for the Homocord record label‚Äîcame out in early 1930 under the title \\"Alabama-Song\\"; it was rerecorded the same year for the Ultraphon record label for release with the 1930 Leipzig premiere of The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, despite Lenya not being a member of that cast.. She continued to perform and record the song throughout her life, including for her 1955 album Lotte Lenya Sings Kurt Weill ('), released in the United States under the title Berlin Theater Songs.. The Doors version The song was recorded in 1966 by the rock group the Doors, listed as \\"Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)\\". The melody is changed and the verse beginning \\"Show me the way to the next little dollar\\" is omitted. On the album version, lead singer Jim Morrison altered the second verse from \\"Show us the way to the next pretty boy\\" to \\"Show me the way to the next little girl\\", but, on the 1967 Live at the Matrix recording, he sings the original \\"next pretty boy\\". For the Doors' version, keyboardist Ray Manzarek plays the Marxophone along with the organ and keyboard bass.

He cut a version at Tony Visconti‚Äôs studio after the European leg of the tour, and in 1980 it was issued as a single to hasten the end of Bowie‚Äôs contract with RCA. With unconventional key changes, the track \\"seemed calculated to disrupt any radio programme on which it was lucky enough to get played\\".Roy Carr & Charles Shaar Murray (1981). Bowie: An Illustrated Record: p.108 Nevertheless, backed with a stripped-down acoustic version of \\"Space Oddity\\" recorded in December 1979, the single reached No. 23 in the UK. Although Bowie also changed the \\"pretty boy\\" line like Morrison, he sang Weill's original melody. Bowie would appear in a BBC version of Brecht's Baal, and release an EP of songs from the play. He performed \\"Alabama Song\\" again on his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour and 2002 Heathen tours.

A right-handed batsman and left-arm leg-break and googly bowler, he was known for his attacking style of play. He captained both his county and his country; after the Second World War, he served several terms as a Test selector. Born into a cricketing family, Robins attended Highgate School, where he earned a reputation as one of the outstanding schoolboy cricketers of his generation. He made his debut in first-class cricket, for Middlesex, in 1925. At Cambridge he won cricket \\"blues\\" in each of his three years, 1926 to 1928. He played his first Test match, against South Africa, in 1929, and thereafter played intermittently for England in each of the seasons up to 1937 ‚Äì he played all his cricket as an amateur, which constrained his availability for both county and country. He toured Australia as vice-captain to G.O. Allen in 1936‚Äì37, and assumed the captaincy of the international side for three matches in 1937. He captained Middlesex from 1935 to 1938, again after the war in 1946 and 1947, and for a final season in 1950. In 1947 he led Middlesex to the County Championship. Robins was a member of the Test selectors' panel in 1946‚Äì48, in 1954, and finally in 1962‚Äì64 when he acted as chairman. He was controversially involved in an unsuccessful attempt, in 1954, to replace the current England captain, Len Hutton, with the young and inexperienced David Sheppard. He was a strong advocate of \\"brighter cricket\\", to an extent that sometimes failed to recognise the realities of international cricket in the postwar era, and put him at odds with the players of a later generation. This problem was evident when Robins served as manager of the touring team to the West Indies in 1959‚Äì60, when his forthright, autocratic approach adversely affected his relationship with the team's captain and vice-captain, Peter May and Colin Cowdrey. Whatever his difficulties in coming to terms with the cricket of a later era, Robins was widely recognised as one of the most dynamic cricketers of his time, a fact that was acknowledged in the tributes paid after his death, in 1968, by his former playing colleagues. His son, Charles Robins, played for Middlesex from 1953 to 1960, as a leg-spin and googly bowler in the manner of his father. Early life Robins was born in Stafford on 3 June 1906. His father was Vivian Harry Robins (1880‚Äì1963), who played Minor Counties cricket for Staffordshire before the First World War as a leg-break bowler and right-handed batsman ‚Äì characteristics which his son would also develop. In 1917 the family moved to London, where Walter Robins attended Highgate School. He was coached at cricket first by his father, to whom he would later attribute much of his eventual success, and, at Highgate, by the former England player Albert Knight. He also played club cricket for East Molesey. Attending Highgate from April 1921 until July 1925, Robins was four years in the football XI (captain for the last two), three years in the Eton Fives VI (captain for the last two) and was in the cricket first XI from 1922 to 1925, again being captain in his last two years; in 1925 he scored 816 runs for a batting average of 62.76, and took 60 wickets at a bowling average of 15.18. These figures included a score of 206 against Aldenham School; his all- round performances made him, according to Wisden, \\"one of the great schoolboy players of the year\\". In the summer of 1925, before entering Cambridge University, Robins made his debut in first-class cricket, when he appeared for Middlesex in the County Championship. The match was on 19 August, against Worcestershire. He was out for 0 in his only innings, and did not bowl. Playing career=Cambridge University Queens' College, Cambridge Robins was awarded a scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge University, joining in October 1925; in the following summer he gained his cricket \\"blue\\" as a freshman. At this stage he was seen purely as a batsman; in the 1926 University match against Oxford he made scores of 37 and 21 not out and did not bowl. In the following year against Oxford his scores were 55 and 41, but this effort was passed in 1928, when he scored 53 and 101 not out, and also made an impact as a bowler, with 8 wickets in the match. His development as a bowler may have been assisted by a spell he underwent, in 1926, at the Aubrey Faulkner cricket school. His performance in the 1928 University match earned him a place in the Gentlemen's team, in the historic Gentlemen v. Players fixture at Lord's in June 1928, but here he was largely unsuccessful, taking no wickets and making little impact as a batsman. In addition to his cricket prowess, Robins was a competent Association footballer, who played for Cambridge in each of his years at the university, being captain of the side in 1927. A right-winger, he also played football for the Corinthians, a prominent amateur team, and later represented the professional side, Nottingham Forest, in two Football League matches, each on Christmas Day, 1929 and 1930. Middlesex The pavilion at Lord's home of Middlesex County Cricket Club (2005 photograph) Robins's career with Middlesex extended from 1925 to 1951. After leaving Cambridge, he played his first full season for the county in 1929, scoring 1,134 runs and taking 162 wickets, thus performing the \\"cricketer's double\\" ‚Äì the only time in his career that he achieved this feat although, as Wisden records, he came near to repeating it on several occasions. Robins's positive batting, with the emphasis on attack, combined with his inventive bowling, made him a popular favourite with crowds. His highest score for the county was 140, against Cambridge University in 1930, and his best bowling return was 8 wickets for 69, against Gloucestershire in 1929. He twice performed hat-tricks: first against Leicestershire in 1929, and again against Somerset in 1937. He was also recognised as a brilliant fieldsman, often in the covers but equally, in the deep field. Robins was one of Wisdens five \\"Cricketers of the Year\\" in 1930. In its citation, Wisden described him as \\"a remarkable young cricketer of whom the best has quite possibly not yet been seen\\". In 1935 he assumed the captaincy of the county and, according to his Wisden obituarist, \\"transformed a hitherto drab Middlesex side\\". The cricket historian Alan Gibson describes how he \\"galvanised\\" the team. For the first time since the early 1920s, Middlesex became serious contenders for the County Championship, finishing third in 1935, and as runners-up in each of the next three seasons, with a particularly close finish behind Yorkshire in 1937. Robins relinquished the captaincy at the end of the 1938 season, but resumed it in 1946 and 1947, after the Second World War, and in 1947 finally led Middlesex to the championship title. He took charge of the county again in 1950, after which, following a single appearance in 1951, he left the first-class county game. This was not quite the end of his Middlesex cricket; in 1952 and 1953 he played fairly regularly for the Second XI in Minor Counties matches. England After playing in the Test Trial match in June 1929, Robins was selected for the second Test against the visiting South Africans, beginning at Lord's on 29 June. He did nothing of note in the match, and was not chosen again during the series. In the following season, he was included in the side to face the Australians in the first Test of the 1930 series, at Nottingham on 13 June. During the Australians' second innings, as they chased 429 runs to win the match, Robins took the key wicket of Don Bradman, helping to ensure an England victory. In the second Test, at Lord's, Australia scored 729 for 6 declared (Bradman 254), the record score for a Test at Lords; Robins's bowling figures were 1 for 172 runs off 42 overs. Robins batted as England struggled to save the match ‚Äì they eventually lost it by 7 wickets ‚Äì and was criticised for his impetuous running between the wickets, after he almost ran out Percy Chapman, his captain. He was dropped for the remainder of the five-match series, although some critics thought it was a mistake to drop one whom they considered \\"the best of our young all-rounders\\". G.O. Allen, Robins's captain in Australia, 1936‚Äì37 However, Robins remained in the selectors' minds, and was chosen for at least one Test in each of the subsequent summers except 1934, until 1937. His best Test bowling performance was 6 for 32 against the West Indies in 1933; two years later he scored his only Test century, 108 against South Africa. He was selected for the 1932‚Äì33 Australian tour, under Douglas Jardine, but had to decline because of his business commitments. In 1936‚Äì37, however, he was able to go to Australia, as vice-captain to G.O. Allen. It was not a happy tour for Robins. Early on he broke a finger, which affected both his ability to spin the ball and his batting grip; as a result, he had little success with bat or ball, although Wisden records that he \\"fielded magnificently\\". England won the first two matches of the five-match Test series; in the third Test, at a crucial point in the Australians' second innings, Robins dropped Bradman. He apologised to his captain; Allen is said to have replied: \\"Don't give it a thought, Walter. You've probably cost us the Ashes\\". Bradman went on to score 270, Australia won the match and the next two, to take the series. In 1937, Allen was unable to play much, so the captaincy for the three-match series against New Zealand devolved on Robins. England won the series 1‚Äì0, with two Tests drawn. Robins considered his appointment as a stop-gap, until Allen's return; in the event, the captaincy passed to Walter Hammond, who in November 1937 changed his status from professional to amateur, in order to fulfil what was then an inviolable condition for appointment to the England captaincy. The 1937 season thus ended both Robins's captaincy and, as it turned out, his Test career, although during the following ten years his name was from time to time mentioned in connection with the captaincy. In 1948, when the Australians were again in England, Robins was included in the Test Trial which preceded the series. He was unsuccessful in his only innings, and did not bowl; the captaincy remained with Norman Yardley. Towards the end of the series, when England were 3‚Äì0 down, there was talk of replacing Yardley with Robins in the final Test, but the idea came to nothing. Altogether, Robins played in 19 Tests, scoring 612 runs (1 century, 4 fifties) for a batting average of 26.60, and taking 64 wickets for a bowling average of 27.46. He held 12 catches. Other teams In March 1930 Robins toured Argentina with Sir Julien Cahn's XI, playing in three representative matches. He toured again with Cahn's team, to Canada, Bermuda and the United States in 1933. After the Second World War, in 1951, he led an MCC team which toured Canada. Following his retirement from county cricket he played occasional first-class matches during the 1950s, for the Free Foresters, the MCC, and other teams. His final first-class game was for the MCC against Ireland, in Dublin in 1958, when he was 52 years old. In all first-class cricket Robins scored 13,844 runs for a batting average of 26.39, including 11 centuries with a highest score of 140. As a bowler he took 969 wickets, average 23.30, taking 10 wickets in a match on four occasions. He also held 217 catches. Test selector After the Second World War, Robins served on three separate occasions as a member of the England Test selectors' panel: 1946‚Äì48, under the chairmanship first of Sir Stanley Jackson and then A.J. Holmes; 1954, when Harry Altham was chairman; and 1962‚Äì64, when Robins himself chaired the panel. Len Hutton, dropped from the Test side in 1948 As a selector in 1948, Robins was involved in two controversial decisions: the dropping of Hutton for the third Test of the 1948 series against Australia, and the omission of Doug Wright from the fourth Test of the same series. Hutton was dropped on the grounds that he had displayed deficiencies against the pace of the Australian bowlers Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller. His replacement was the Gloucestershire batsman George Emmett, who scored 10 and 0 in the match; Hutton was speedily reinstated. Wright's omission from the Leeds Test, which deprived England of the services of their leading spinner probably, in the view of the cricket historian Simon Wilde, cost them victory in the match. In 1954, Robins promoted the idea that for the forthcoming 1954‚Äì55 tour of Australia, Hutton, who had been appointed two years earlier as England's first professional captain in the 20th century, should be replaced by David Sheppard, his deputy in two Tests against the 1954 Pakistan side when Hutton was unwell. The ostensible reason given was to enable Hutton to concentrate on his batting, though some saw the move as reflecting the continuing antagonism of the old cricketing \\"establishment\\" to the advent of a professional captain. The matter was resolved in Hutton's favour, and he duly led the side to victory in Australia. As chairman from 1962, Robins let it be known that he favoured positive play: \\"Play aggressively at all times; otherwise you will not be chosen for England\\". Wisden records that, in terms of England's results during this period, this ultimatum had limited effect, though \\"at least it relieved Test cricket of some of the stagnation which threatened its popularity at the time\\". In 1962, Robins again raised the prospect of Sheppard's captaincy, in relation to the 1962‚Äì63 Australian tour. At this stage Sheppard, by now an ordained clergyman in charge of the Mayflower Centre in London's Docklands, had not played Test cricket for five years. He was, however, willing to go if chosen and, in a demonstration of his current form, scored a century in the Gentlemen v. Players fixture. Despite this, and Robins's advocacy, the captaincy went to Ted Dexter. Robins's selectorial approach did not impress all of his fellow-selectors. Alec Bedser, in an interview with Frank Keating many years later, remembered: \\"We would meet at his flat on a Sunday morning. He never really watched any cricket. Just went by what he read in the papers or heard from his cronies. He would turn up to the first day of a Test, but on the second day, after lunch, he'd sometimes clear off and go to the pictures\\". Tour manager When England toured the West Indies early in 1960, under the captaincy of Peter May, Robins was appointed as tour manager. In terms of results the tour was successful ‚Äì England won the five-match Test series 1‚Äì0 ‚Äì but Robins was less felicitous in his managerial role. He failed to form a satisfactory relationship with May, or with the other players. According to Colin Cowdrey, May's vice-captain, almost before the ship carrying the party had left British waters Robins was seeking to impose his ideas of \\"military discipline\\" on the side, and telling May how the team should be run. May fell ill during the tour, and Cowdrey assumed the leadership. In the final Test of the series, which was heading for a draw, Robins tried to persuade Cowdrey to \\"make a game of it\\", but Cowdrey chose to protect England's series lead and play cautiously. Afterwards, to the team's dismay, Robins came to the dressing room and publicly castigated Cowdrey, in front of the players, for his lack of spirit. This was too much for England's leading fast bowler, Fred Trueman who, according to another player's account, ordered Robins out of the room: \\"You ain't no bloody business in 'ere. Get out!\\". Personal life Robins (right) and Carmody at Lord's, England XI v Dominions, 1943 Robins played all his cricket as an amateur and, not being independently wealthy, had to find employment when he left Cambridge in 1928 without taking a degree. As a result, business commitments often restricted Robins's ability to pursue his cricket career, both at county and international level. Initially he worked for Sir Julien Cahn in the latter's furniture business. Cahn, an avid cricket enthusiast, employed numerous cricketers who formed the backbone of his private XI, which played first-class cricket throughout the 1930s. Later, Robins worked in Stafford, Knight & Co. Ltd., a successful family Lloyd's insurance brokerage in the City, which was probably established with Cahn's help. He went on to become Managing Director and later Chairman. During the Second World War, Robins served in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, reaching the rank of squadron leader. He played cricket when he could, and in 1943, in a two-day match at Lord's, captained an England XI against a Dominions XI led by the Australian Keith Carmody. The Dominions team included the future Australian Test all-rounder Keith Miller, and the West Indies Test bowler Learie Constantine. In a close game the England XI were victorious by eight runs. Various members of the Robins family contributed to cricket, for Middlesex and elsewhere. Walter's younger brother, William Vernon Harry, a career Army officer, played several first-class matches for the Army during the 1930s. Walter Robins's son, Robert Victor Charles, known as Charles Robins and, like his father, a leg-spin and googly bowler, was captain of the Eton XI in 1953, and played for Middlesex between 1953 and 1960. Walter's grandson Charles William Veral (born 1965) played for Middlesex 2nd XI in 1983. After his playing days ended, Robins continued to serve Middlesex as a member of its general and cricket committees. He died from bronchopneumonia, aged 62, on 12 December 1968. Appraisal In its 1969 obituary tribute, Wisden acknowledges Robins as \\"one of the most dynamic cricketers of his time\\", who maintained an \\"aggressively enterprising\\" attitude towards the game: \\"Impatient of dull cricket, Robins wasted few scoring opportunities as a batsman, employing his nimble footwork and flexible wrists to the full, especially in cutting and driving\\". There was some early criticism of his effectiveness as a bowler ‚Äì he sometimes tried to bowl too fast, and was erratic in maintaining length ‚Äì but Wilde's analysis of English Test bowlers of leg-breaks and googlies shows Robins, at international level, to have been one of the most effective of this kind in terms both of wickets taken and of cost per wicket. There were divided opinions on Robins's effectiveness as a selector. Doug Insole, who served with him between 1962 and 1964, considered that his judgement of a player was \\"excellent\\". Others were less sure; Wilde records that during Robins's first stint as a selector, 1946‚Äì48, the Australians were dismissive of his judgement, an opinion apparently shared by the former England captain Bob Wyatt, who \\"would have liked more intelligent people on the committee\\". Gibson is critical of Robins's efforts to replace Hutton as captain in 1954, an action which Wilde describes as \\"disloyal and unhelpful\\". It seems that Robins was not particularly popular with the players of a later generation, and that he made little effort to understand them. According to Wilde, Robins failed to recognise the extent to which, in the postwar era, international cricket had changed from his own heyday in the 1930s. It had, says Wilde, become much more tough and attritional, hence Robins's repeated calls for more attacking, brighter cricket were often inappropriate and doomed to failure. Nevertheless, in the view of Billy Griffith, the cricket administrator and long-serving secretary of the MCC, Robins's \\"tremendous enthusiasm and deep knowledge of the game and its history made him the complete cricketer\\". Robins's Middlesex colleague Ian Peebles, who succeeded him as county captain in 1939, described him as \\"the most enthusiastic and joyous cricketer I played with\\".

He was known as Eskandar Mƒ´rzƒÅ () in the Persian Empire, Tsarevich Aleksandr Irakliyevich () in Russia, and as Alexander Mirza in Western Europe. Alexander was the son of the penultimate king of eastern Georgia, Heraclius II, who entrusted him various military and administrative tasks. After the death of Heraclius in 1798, he opposed the accession of his half-brother, King George XII, and the new king's pro-Russian policy. After the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, Alexander spent the rest of his life in trying to undermine the new regime by fomenting unrest in Georgia. Eventually, Alexander's reliance on the Persian military and North Caucasian mercenaries deprived him of popular support. After his last major rebellion was defeated in 1812, Alexander permanently settled in Persia, where he died in 1844.  Early life  Alexander was a son of Heraclius II (Erekle), king of Kartli and Kakheti in eastern Georgia, and his third wife Darejan Dadiani. He was educated by the Catholic missionaries at the court of his father. At age 12 or 13, he was tutored by and served as an aide to the Tiflis-based German adventurer and physician Jacob Reineggs, who played a role in the Russian‚ÄìGeorgian diplomacy until his retirement to the Russian Empire in 1783. Alexander became involved in the politics and administration of his country at a very young age. In 1793, he was entrusted by Heraclius with the government of the district of Kazakh and in 1794 he was invested with the appanage in Somkhiti. Around the same time, Alexander was present with the army sent by Heraclius in support of his grandson, King Solomon II of Imereti, against his rival David. In 1795, Alexander led a Georgian contingent dispatched to help the allied Ibrahim Khalil Khan of Karabakh against the Iranian encroachment. In June, the allies fought back a 20,000-strong force sent by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar against Karabakh. Back in Georgia, in July 1795, Alexander raised a force of Turkic mercenaries brought from Karabakh against the anticipated Iranian advance. Fighting by his father's side, Alexander witnessed the sack of Tiflis in a disastrous attack by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, who resented Heraclius's rapprochement with the Russian Empire and demanded Georgia's reversal to traditional allegiance to Iran. Disappointed by his failure, Heraclius, then over 75, retired to his native Telavi, leaving Alexander in charge of restoring Tiflis.  Break with George XII  The battle on the Iori in 1800 Map of the campaign in Kakheti in 1800 After the death of Heraclius in 1798, Alexander, together with his mother Darejan and brother Iulon, led opposition to the accession of his half- brother, George XII. The conflict between the sons of Heraclius had already been brewing during their father's lifetime, and now evolved into an open confrontation. Alexander occupied the Muslim-majority districts of Kazakh, Borchalo, and Shamshadil, and refused to obey the new king. Being in ill- health and weakened, George XII relied on the Russian protection. Alexander, suspecting that the Russian presence in the country would eventually lead to an outright annexation, was persuaded by the shah of Iran, Fath Ali Shah Qajar, to leave Georgia and join his forces with Omar Khan, the ruler of the Avars in Dagestan and an erstwhile enemy of Heraclius II, in 1799. Fath Ali rewarded Alexander's defection by promising to support his claim to the Georgian throne. Alexander began raising an army and issued an appeal to the people of Kartli and Kakheti, trying to justify his new alliance with the traditional foes of the Georgians and swearing by the grave of Saint Nino that the Avar army was being assembled not to ravage the country, but to defend Alexander's right to the throne. At the same time, he sent letters to his mother and brothers, assuring that they would be saved from the Russian oppression. In November 1800, Alexander and Omar Khan led their forces into Kakheti, but they were met and decisively defeated by a combined Russo- Georgian army on the banks of the Iori river on 7 November 1800. Wounded in action, Omar Khan retreated to the mountains of Dagestan, while Alexander and his followers fled to Ibrahim Khalil Khan of Karabakh, and then to Dagestan. In the meantime, the defeat of his allies convinced Fath Ali not to proceed with his planned invasion of Georgia and he recalled his army to Tabriz. Declared by the Russians a traitor to be taken dead or alive, Alexander thus began three decades of resistance.  Struggle against Russia = Russo- Persian war  After King George XII's death in December 1800, the Russian government prevented his heir Prince David from assuming the throne and brought Kartli and Kakheti more closely under its control. On 12 September 1801, Tsar Alexander I of Russia issued a manifesto, declaring the Georgian monarchy abolished and imposing a Russian administration. As the Russians began deporting the Georgian royal family members to Russia proper, many princes openly revolted. Alexander's brothers, Iulon and Parnaoz, fled to Solomon II, King of Imereti in western Georgia, while his half-nephew Teimuraz, a son of the late king George XII and the future historian, joined him in Dagestan. In 1803, Alexander attempted to win over the newly appointed Russian commander in Georgia, Prince Pavel Tsitsianov, of Georgian descent. In a warm letter sent to Tsitsianov, Alexander rejoiced in the fact that a \\"son of the Georgian soil\\" had been appointed as a commander and promised reconciliation provided the Georgian kingship was restored under the Russian protectorate. In response, Tsistianov, a loyal servant of the Russian Empire who saw no future for Georgia apart from Russia, sent General Vasily Gulyakov to the conquest of Char and Belokan, the mountainous communities sheltering Alexander and Teimuraz. Both fled to Tabriz and joined the ranks of the reformed Persian army, Alexander as a senior adviser to the Crown Prince Abbas Mirza and Teimuraz as a commander of artillery. As tensions were mounting along the Caucasus frontier, Alexander, along with Pir Quli Khan Qajar, was placed at the head of a Persian force in Ganja. When the Russo-Persian war broke out openly in June 1804, the Persian army under Abbas Mirza and Alexander fought the Russian troops inconclusively at Echmiadzin on 20 June 1804 and then successfully defended Erivan, forcing General Tsitsianov to withdraw back in Georgia in September 1804. At the same time, Alexander sent letters to all principal dignitaries in Georgia as well as the rebellious Georgian and Ossetian highlanders, promising them that he would be arriving with Persian armies to end the Russian rule. In 1810, Alexander joined the combined Persian-Ottoman venture of invasion of Georgia, also supported by Solomon II, the fugitive king of Imereti, and Leon, Alexander's nephew. However, the Ottoman mobilization was delayed and a Persian force was dispersed in a surprise nighttime attack by the Russians near Akhalkalaki in September 1810. Barely escaping from captivity, Alexander fell back to Tabriz and Solomon retired to Trabizond, where he, the last reigning Georgian king, died in 1815. Alexander's disillusioned nephew Teimuraz, prompted by his tutor the poet Petre Laradze, escaped from the Persian camp and surrendered to the Russian authorities.  Rebellion in Kakheti  Omar Khan of Avary hosting Prince Alexander as imagined by the artist Khalil-Bek Musayasul (1897‚Äì1949). In September 1812, Alexander crossed into Kakheti with some 100 followers to invigorate an anti-Russian movement in the region. His force of Georgian rebels and Dagestani auxiliaries fought a series of engagements with the Russian troops until its final defeat at the hands of General Dimitri Orbeliani in November 1812. In the meantime, in October 1812, General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky decisively defeated Abbas Mirza's attempt to advance towards Georgia in the battle of Aslanduz. According to the British officer William Monteith, who knew Alexander personally and accompanied him during his raid into Georgia, the rebellious prince, finding it impossible to raise the means of paying his Lezgian auxiliaries, had to consent to their carrying of Georgian slaves. As a result, Alexander's army was disbanded and he fled to the Khevsur highlanders. The Russians under General Stahl proceeded with ravaging the Khevsur villages, putting Alexander into flight to the Avars and other mountainous tribes of the Caucasus. The Russian authorities vainly pressured the mountaineers into surrendering the fugitive prince; they evinced toward him, in the words of Monteith, \\"a fidelity equal to that of the Highlanders towards Charles Edward under similar circumstances after the battle of Culloden.\\" Alexander's association with the Avars gave origin to a legend widespread in the area in the 19th century, according to which Imam Shamil, the future leader of Caucasian resistance to the Russian expansion, was his natural son. Apollon Runovsky, an officer in charge of Shamil in captivity at Kaluga, claimed in his diaries that Shamil himself forged this legend in an attempt to win the support of Georgian highlanders.  Life in Persia  In spite of a thorough Russian search, in September 1818, Alexander fought his way to Akhaltsikhe in the Ottoman territory. The Russian commander- in-chief Alexey Yermolov wanted Alexander if not alive, then dead so as to have his remains interred \\"with some honors\\" in Tiflis and preclude ‚Äúall sorts of concoctions‚Äù. Pursuant to Yermolov's instructions, General Veliyaminov avoided directly encroaching on an Ottoman or Persian territory to kill Alexander so as not to tarnish Russia's image \\"in the eyes of all Europe\\", but authorized Colonel Ladinsky to bribe Alexander's Turkish companions or local guides to murder the prince. All these efforts failed and, after months of delay by the local Ottoman authorities, Alexander managed to safely reach Persia in January 1819. The shah gave Alexander a pension and possession of some Armenian-populated villages in Salmas. With the help of his friend, Crown Prince Abbas Mirza, and the Armenian Catholicos Ephraim, Alexander married Mariam, a daughter of Sahak Aghamalyan, the secular chief (melik) of the Armenians of the Erivan Khanate. Both Alexander and the Persian government hoped that this marriage would secure Armenian support against the Russians. During his refuge life in Persia, Alexander maintained contacts with the European diplomats and travelers. Among these was the Jewish Christian missionary Joseph Wolff, whom Alexander met at his estate in Khosrova. The prince served to Wolff as a source of information about the genealogy of the Bagrationi dynasty, including a claim of descent from David, and the presence of the Jews in Georgia. Sir Robert Ker Porter, who saw Alexander in Tabriz in 1819 and noted his \\"bold independence of spirit\\" and irreconcilability to the Russian possession of Georgia, compared the refuge prince to \\"the royal lion hunted from his hereditary waste, yet still returning to hover near, and roar in proud loneliness of his ceaseless threatening to the human strangers who had disturbed his reign\\". William Monteith recalled that Alexander \\"never showed any pride of birth, nor did he gave way to useless regrets for the loss of his fortune and princely dignity, though he had no hesitation in talking of his adventures, or giving any information that was asked for concerning them.\\" The problem of protection offered by Iran to Alexander was one of the main points at issue during the ambassadorial mission of Semyon I. Mazarovich, sent in 1819 by the Russian government to Iran as a permanent resident diplomatic mission, to which the young poet Alexander Griboyedov was also attached.  Later years  Tabriz in the 1840s Alexander continued his efforts to foment anti-Russian revolts in various provinces of Georgia. During the Russo‚ÄìPersian war of 1826‚Äì1828, he was in the Char community, trying to mobilize the local clans for a planned invasion of Kakheti, which failed to materialize. A report in The Asiatic Journal from that period noted that Alexander, \\"one of the principal refugee chiefs\\" in Iran and \\"a man of an enterprize\\", had lost confidence among the Georgians who were suspicious of his use of Dagestani auxiliaries and showed no \\"disposition to rise on the present occasion against their rulers.\\" In 1832, a number of leading Georgian nobles and intellectuals plotted a coup against the Russian rule. According to their plan, the principal Russian officials were to be invited to a ball where they would be either arrested or killed. Then Alexander would be invited to assume the crown of Georgia, possibly as a constitutional monarch. Alexander corresponded with the conspirators and had his own agent among their numbers, but the prince considered himself too old to be directly involved and told the Georgians \\"to do what they liked\\". The plot was eventually betrayed and its leaders were rounded up by the Russian authorities. Having abandoned all hopes of returning to Georgia, Alexander continued to live as a private person and died in obscurity in Tehran in 1844. He was buried in the courtyard of St. Thaddeus and Bartholomew Armenian Church.  Family and descendants  In the lifetime of his father, in 1790, Alexander was betrothed to the daughter of a Circassian chief from Greater Kabarda, of the Misostov clan. Monteith refers to her as Alexander's wife, but the girl, baptized in Georgia as Nino, died after her arrival in Tiflis before the marriage was effected. Alexander married Mariam (12 August 1808 ‚Äì 7 October 1882), a daughter of the Armenian dignitary Sahak Melik-Aghamalyan, in 1825 in Erivan. The Iranian governor of the Erivan Khanate, Hossein Khan Sardar, maintained good relations with Sahak and had played an instrumental role in arranging the marriage. Through her mother, Mariam was a cousin of the prominent Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian. In 1827 she, together with their son, Irakli, settled in her native Erivan, which was soon conquered by Russia. In 1834 the Russian government ordered her to move to Saint Petersburg, where she was known as tsarevna Maria Isaakovna Gruzinskaya (Russian for \\"of Georgia\\") and lived on a state-granted pension until her death in 1882. Mariam's remains were moved to Tiflis and interred there, at the northern wall of the Armenian Vank cathedral. After the demolition of the cathedral by the Soviet government in 1930, her marble gravestone with a trilingual Russian, Armenian, and Georgian epitaph was moved to the State Museum of the History of Georgia in Tiflis (now Tbilisi). Alexander's son, Prince Irakli (18 August 1826 ‚Äì 27 April 1882), pursued an officer's career in the Russian army. Irakli's only son of his marriage to Princess Tamar Chavchavadze, Alexander, died at the age of 2 in 1879. His daughters, Yelizaveta (1870‚Äì1942) and Yekaterina (1872‚Äì1917), were married to the princes Mamuka Orbeliani and Ivan Ratiev, respectively. Alexander also had an illegitimate daughter, named Yelizaveta (13 July 1811 ‚Äì 17 September 1836), who was the second wife of Samson-Khan (Samson Yakovlevich Makintsev; 1770‚Äì1853), a Russian defector and a high-ranking commander in the Qajar army. Samson's son of this marriage, Jibrail-Khan, subsequently served as an aide- de-camp to the shah Naser al-Din.

With close friend Pharrell Williams, he formed the production duo the Neptunes in the early 1990s, with whom he has produced songs for many recording artists. He is also a member of the band N.E.R.D, alongside Williams and Shay Haley. Early life Hugo was born in the South Hampton Roads city of Portsmouth, Virginia, to Filipino parents. He grew up in Virginia Beach; his father is a retired Navy officer while his mother was a laboratory technician. Hugo met Pharrell Williams in grade school in band class, eventually linking back together at a magnet school for gifted teens. The two began working together, mixing beats and playing in various live bands. Career After several years of occasional productions for artists often associated with founder Teddy Riley, such as BLACKstreet and SWV, Hugo and Williams scored songwriting and production assignments with artists such as N.O.R.E. and Mystikal, which became hits, allowing them to produce with their own distinctive sound for megastars such as Jay-Z. In 2002 The Neptunes were named Producers of the Year at both The Source Awards and the Billboard Music Awards. The Neptunes won the 2004 Grammy for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical.

DVD/CD combo Venue Songs DVD/CD is a compilation album released in 2005 by They Might Be Giants on their own label, Idlewild Records. The bulk of the material comes from 2004's Venue Songs, which is included in here in its entirety, although its order has been rearranged. Venue Songs was composed of original live songs about the venue they were playing in at the time. They wrote a song for each of the venues in about a day. This album includes new studio recorded versions of 11 of the venue songs, as well as other non-album songs recorded in the past year. The DVD contains a storyline about Venue Songs which integrates videos for some of the venue songs, and includes other bonus videos as well.  Story  A Deranged Millionaire (played by John Hodgman) approaches They Might Be Giants and challenges them to write a new song every day on their current tour, celebrating the unique characteristics of every venue in which they perform. If they do not accomplish this goal, they will forever lose the talisman that grants them their magical musical abilities.

It is located on the right bank of the Chepelare River, 189 km from Sofia and 10 km south of Asenovgrad, and is directly subordinate to the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. The monastery is known and appreciated for the unique combination of Byzantine, Georgian and Bulgarian culture, united by the common faith.  History  The monastery was founded in 1083 by Prince Gregory Pakourianos, a prominent statesman and military commander in the Byzantine service, as a Georgian-dominated Orthodox monastery.The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity By Ken Parry p. 147 He set up a seminary(school) for the youth at the monastery. The curriculum included religion, as well as mathematics, history and music.

During the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Bachkovo Monastery was patronized by Tsar Ivan Alexander, which is evidenced by an image of him on the arches of the ossuary's narthex. It is believed that the founder of Tarnovo Literary School and last patriarch of the mediaeval Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Euthymius, was exiled by the Turks and worked in the school of the monastery in the early 15th century. Although the monastery survived the first waves of Turkish invasion in Bulgarian lands, it was then looted and destroyed, but restored near the end of the 15th century. The refectory, whose mural paintings by an anonymous painter bear a significant artistic value, was reconstructed in 1601 and the Church of Mary, still preserved today, was finished in 1604. Bachkovo Monastery is the final resting place of both Patriarch Euthymius (1330‚Äì1404) and Patriarch Cyril (1953‚Äì1971).  Complex =Ossuary The medieval ossuary A 14th-century donor portrait in fresco of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander in the ossuary Front view of the Bachkovo Monastery The only part that has survived from the monastery's original structure is the ossuary, which has a specific architectural design and ancient frescoes, and is situated 300 m away from the contemporary monastery complex. It looks inaccessible when viewed from the north. The building has two storeys, of which only one can be seen from the south. From architectural point of view the plan of the ossuary looks foreign to the local traditions. It is reminiscent of Syrian-Palestine mortuaries with its two floors of identical design. Each floor has a narthex, a single nave and an apse. The ground floor is intended for a crypt and has 14 burial niches. It would appear that the original ossuary was designed to house fourteen specific corpses under the floor pavement. This style of ossuary is not found anywhere else in the world. The apse on the upper floor, the church proper (known as The Holy Trinity Church), is semicircular on the inside and pentagonal on the outside with 3 openings to let some daylight into the altarplace. The building is vaulted. The ossuary is interesting with the methods of its construction. It represents a mixture of Georgian and Byzantine building traditions. The facade is attractively diversified with 8 blind niches and a succession of layers of brick and stone, joined together with mortar. The ante chamber is separated from the church by thick walls and solid wooden doors, painted with the Georgian Cross depicting the strong influence of the Georgians in the construction and running of this monastery in the 11th and 12th Century. Above the doorway arch is the mural of the Madonna and child.Gracias, Luke ‚Äì The Devil's Prayer ‚Äì Australian eBook Publisher, 2016, Cathedral The Cathedral Church of the Virgin Mary The Cathedral Church of the Virgin Mary (dating from 1604) is the place where a valuable icon of the Virgin Mary Eleusa from 1310 is kept (brought from Georgia). According to the legend, the icon is wonder-working, attracting many pilgrims. This church was built in the place of the monastery's oldest church destroyed by the Turks. The building has survived to this day in its original structure of a three- aisled, cruciform domed basilica with three pentagonal apses. A silver- gilded cross rising from the dome bears the inscription \\"Always win!\\" in Georgian. The murals in the spacious narthex were painted in 1643 and depict a life-size portraits of Georgi and his son Constantine, who were high-ranking notables in Istanbul and donors to the church. The frescoes in the nave were painted much later, in 1850, by Joan Mosch (master Mosko). The two central icons in the iconostasis are exactly dated ‚Äì 1793. these the icons of The Holy Virgin and Jesus Christ. The woodwork ‚Äî iconostasis, bishop's throne and the like, dates from the 18th century. Church of the Archangels Bachkovo Monastery plan The Church of the Archangels Another medieval church of the monastery is the Archangels' Church dating back probably to the 12th century, the vaulted open narthex of which was painted by Zahari Zograf in 1841. The inside of the church was painted by the artist Joan Mosch in 1846. Jujube tree The broad branches of a jujube, brought from Georgia more than two centuries ago, stretch over the courtyard. A famous jujube brandy (djindjifilova rakia) is destilled in the monastery (bg) http://svyat.com/–¥–∂–∏–Ω–¥–∂–∏—Ñ–∏–ª—ä—Ç-–µ-–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ- –ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞-–∫—É/ Works of art The museum of the monastery has a rich exhibition of church plate, icons, books, the sword of Friedrich Barbarossa, a sultan's firman from 1452, a wood-carved cross with miniatures. A fresco of the Doomsday, painted by Zahari Zograf in 1850, is retained in the Saint Nicholas Church and is thought of as one of the most interesting works of art of the Bulgarian National Revival. =The ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù mural= The \\"Panorama\\" mural The ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù mural, which runs along the outside wall of the refectory, represents the history of Bachkovo monastery pictorially. It provides a bird‚Äôs eye view of the monastery with all the surrounding buildings at the time of the painting. Under the influence of different atmospheric conditions like rain, snow, fog, cold, wind, the biggest scenic mural on the Balkan peninsula has preserved the freshness of its paint. The painter Alexi Atanasov, a Bulgarian from the town of Negush, worked in this region in the 19th century. The year of the decoration can be determined by an inscription that was on the outside walls of the western monastery wing, which was burned in 1902. This inscription read: > ‚ÄúThe following depiction was finished under the ministry of Abbot Cyril on > 22 July 1846. The depiction has been made by my own hand, Alexi Atanasov > from Negush.‚Äù As a model, the painter used a copper print that was made in Vienna with the financial help of the merchant from Samokov, Petar Rana, in 1807. Alexi Atanasov added valuable details and pictorial elements of his own. The ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù mural gives us rich information about the architectural ensemble of the monastery in the 19th century. The northern facades of the churches St Archangels Michael and Gabriel and The Holy Virgin, were painted, too. The monastic buildings with their big buttresses on the river side can be seen. Central place was given to the founders of the monastery, who were depicted in monastic attire. The Emperor Alexius Comnenus is among them. At their side are the donors from the 14th century: George and Gabriel. The surroundings of the monastery are shown: the nunnery in Assenovgrad; Assen‚Äôs fortress; the chapels nearby. The painter gave us a good idea from ethnographical point of view, about the clothing of the aristocracy from Plovdiv and the festal clothing of the women in the Rhodopes, through the group of the people that are following the Procession of the Miraculous Icon. Details, such as the well in the northern courtyard and the belfry in the Church of the Archangels, are included. Scenes from the passionals of the two Saints George and Demetrius are depicted at the side of the ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù. The ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù mural is exceptionally interesting because of its sheer size and because of its artistic impact and craftsmanship. The paints were made after a recipe by the painter himself, probably from grasses mixed with egg emulsion. The used painting technique is ‚Äúfresco buono,‚Äù which is a mural art of painting that is applied on a smooth moist plaster. When the water evaporates the images emerge on the surface. The implication of this technique, with the great deal of artistic mastery, is why these murals look fresh today.

The British finally won after carrying out gruelling protracted jungle campaigns against the Polygar armies. Many lives were lost on both sides and the victory over the Polygars brought large parts of the territories of Tamil Nadu under British control, enabling them to get a strong hold in Southern India. First Polygar War The war between the British and Kattabomman Nayak of Panchalankurichi Palayam in the then Tirunelveli region is often classified as the First Polygar war. In 1799, a brief meeting (over pending taxes) between Kattabomman and the British ended in a bloody encounter in which the British commander of the forces was slain by the former. A price was put on Kattabomman's head prompting many Polygars to an open rebellion. After a series of battles in the Panchalankurichi fort with additional reinforcements from Tiruchirapalli, Kattabomman was defeated, but he escaped to the jungles in Pudukottai country. He was captured by the British with the help of Ettappan, Pudukottai Raja after his backroom agreement with the British. After a summary trial, Kattabomman was hanged in front of the public in order to intimidate them in Kayatharu. Subramania Pillai, a close associate of Kattabomman, was also publicly hanged and his head was fixed on a pike at Panchalankurichi for public view. Soundra Pandian, another rebel leader, was brutally killed by having his head smashed against a village wall. Kattabomman's brother Oomaidurai was imprisoned in Palayamkottai prison while the fort was razed to the ground and wealth looted by the troops. Second Polygar War Despite the suppression of the First Polygar War in 1799, a rebellion broke out again in 1800. The Second Polygar War was more stealthy and covert in nature. The rebellion broke out when a band of Palayakkarar armies bombed the British barracks in Coimbatore. In the war that followed, Oomaithurai allied himself with Maruthu Pandiyar and was part of a grand alliance against the company which included Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja of Malabar. The Palayakarrars had artillery and a weapon manufacturing unit in Salem and Dindigul jungles. They also received clandestine training from the French in the Karur region. Dheeran Chinnamalai Gounder headed the western Tamil Nadu popularly known as Kongu Nadu. The British columns were exposed throughout the operations to constant harassing attacks and had usually to cut their way through almost impenetrable jungles fired on from undercover on all sides. The Polygars resisted stubbornly and the storming of their hill-forts proved on several occasions sanguinary (involving or causing much bloodshed) work. The British finally won after a long expensive campaign that took more than a year. The Company forces led by Lt. Colonel Agnew laid siege to the Panchalankurichi fort and captured it in May 1801 after a prolonged siege and artillery bombardment. Oomaithurai escaped the fall of the fort and joined Maruthu brothers at their jungle fort at Kalayar Kovil. The Company forces pursued him there and eventually captured Kalayar Kovil in October 1801. Oomaithurai and the Maruthu brothers were hanged on 16 November 1801 at Tiruppathur (Sivagangai Dist.). Results The suppression of the Polygar rebellions of 1799 and 1800-1805 resulted in the liquidation of the influence of the chieftains. Under the terms of the Carnatic Treaty (31 July 1801), the British assumed direct control over Tamil Nadu. The Polygar system which had flourished for two and a half centuries came to a violent end and the company introduced a Zamindari settlement in its place. Later day folklore  In subsequent years, legend and folklore developed around Dheeran Chinnamalai, Kattabomman and Maruthu Pandiyar.

More specifically it is used to describe the expeditionary campaigns of the British Army in the Kingdom of Kandy in 1803 and 1815. Background From 1638‚Äì58, the Dutch East India company had intervened in the Sinhalese‚ÄìPortuguese War, capturing all the Portuguese possessions on the island of Ceylon (now called Sri Lanka). They established the colony of Dutch Ceylon, controlling the coasts and lowlands, whilst the Kingdom of Kandy maintained their independence in the mountainous eastern interior. In 1795 the Dutch Republic was overthrown with French assistance, forming the Batavian Republic as a puppet state. Britain, which was at war with France, feared that influence would result in French control or use of the strategically important port of Trincomalee and others on the island. Following the Kew Letters of 1795, the British occupied Dutch possessions in Sri Lanka. These included not only Trincomalee but Batticaloa, Galle, and Jaffna, as well as the entirety of Sri Lanka's lowlying coastal areas. The new colony of British Ceylon was determined to expand and control the entirety of the island, and had reformed traditional social structures like the caste system and the rajakariya (lit. \\"kingwork\\", labour and or tithes owed to the Kandyan king). This added to the tension between them and the still independent Kingdom of Kandy. Mountainous central Sri Lanka remained independent, having resisted 250 years of European attempts to control Ceylon. Kandy was now under the rule of the Nayaka kings of Senkadagala. Early British attempts at securing a treaty with mountainous kingdom were rejected.. Retrieved on 23 August 2008. The internal stability of Kandy was shaky, as king Sri Vikrama Rajasinha found himself being constantly undermined and intrigued against by powerful Sinhalese nobles. He also faced a potential usurper in the form of Muttusami, brother-in-law of the previous king Rajadhirajasingha, who had fled to British controlled lands in the early 19th century and had been agitating against the beleaguered king ever since. The earliest British garrison numbered about 6,000 which was increased through the recruitment of local sepoys, and the forces of the Empire further enjoyed exclusive access to the sea. Kandy, in contrast, had the advantage of being situated in difficult, mountainous terrain, and could also draw on four hundred years of experience resisting European colonists. First war (1803‚Äì1805) Terrain near Kandy; much of the Kingdom was mountainous, thickly forested and malarial, and the routes to Kandy were kept secret and well- guarded. The first Kandyan war was precipitated by the intrigues of a minister of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, Pilimatalawe, who defected to the British and offered to show them the way through central Sri Lanka's winding mountain passes to the capital city. Enraged, the King of Kandy had the minister's family executed. The British dispatched two separate forces into Kandyan territory - one, under Major-General Hay MacDowall, from Colombo, and another, under a Colonel Barbut, from Trincomalee. These included 51st Regiment of Foot, the 19th Regiment of Foot, the Malay (Muslim) 1st Ceylon Regiment, the all-Sinhalese 2nd Ceylon, and the mixed Sinhalese Malay 3rd Ceylon. In the Kandyan army, at least one contingent was under the command of a Malay Muslim prince called 'Sangunglo', an indicator of the multiethnic nature of the mountainous kingdom. After fierce fighting the British force found Senkadagala deserted in February 1803. They swiftly established a garrison, crowned Muttusami as the new, puppet, king of Kandy, and set about subduing the remainder of the kingdom. Despite these early successes the army soon suffered a number of setbacks. The Chief Minister responsible for guiding the British into Kandy had greatly inflated the extent of the king's unpopularity, and resistance proved fierce. The Kandyans resorted to fighting a guerilla war (much the same tactic as they had adopted against the Portuguese and the Dutch) and proved difficult to dislodge. Disease ravaged the garrison left behind in Senkadagala to secure the capital. Perhaps most worrying for them, a number of native sepoys defected to the Kandyans, including a soldier of Malay descent called 'William O'Deen' or 'Odeen', who years later became the first Sri Lankan exiled to Australia. The Kandyans counter-attacked in March and seized Senkadagala. Barbut was taken prisoner and executed, and the British garrison wiped out; only one man, Corporal George Barnsley of the 19th Infantry, survived to tell the tale (though other sources put the number of survivors at four). In the meanwhile the retreating British army was defeated on the banks of the flooding Mahaveli river, leaving only four survivors. Despite this setback the British still remained unquestioned masters of the lands they possessed, as the disastrous Kandyan counter-campaign later in the year proved. Equipped with a handful of captured six-pound cannon, the Kandyan army advanced through the mountain passes as far as the city of Hanwella. Here the army was utterly routed by superior British firepower, forcing Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe to flee back into the mountains. A general rebellion that had erupted in British occupied territory on hearing of the Kandyan invasion was suppressed. Frederick North, governor of Ceylon from 1798‚Äì1805, maintained pressure on the Kandyan frontier with numerous attacks, in 1804 dispatched a force under Captain Arthur Johnston towards Senkadagala. In a pattern that had become clear over the past two hundred or so years, the Kandyans once again defeated the British in the mountainous territory they called home. In 1805, emboldened by their successes, they captured Katuwana, a frontier town. This and the 1803 victory at the Battle of the Mahaveli, were to be Kandy's last, meaningful military successes. Though no treaty was signed officially ending the First Kandyan War, the appointment of General Thomas Maitland as governor of Ceylon in 1805 is generally accepted as the end of this first phase of open hostilities. Interbellum (1805‚Äì1815) Events in the ten years between the end of the First Kandyan War and the Second were such that the complexion of the second conflict was quite different from the first. Whereas in 1805 the British had been forced to contend with a largely hostile native nobility, in 1815 it was this same nobility who essentially invited the British into Kandy and supported their overthrow of Sri Vikrama Rajasingha. Governor Thomas Maitland, in British Ceylon, initiated extensive legal and social reforms to further entrench and strengthen British power. These included the reform of the civil service to eliminate corruption, and the creation of a Ceylonese High Court based on caste law. The Catholic population was enfranchised whilst the Dutch Reformed church lost its privileged position. Maitland also worked to undermine Buddhist authority and sought to attract Europeans to the island by allowing grants of up to 4000 acres (16 km¬≤) on the island. He was replaced in 1812/1813 by Sir Robert Brownrigg, who largely continued these policies. In contrast, an increasingly paranoid Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe categorically alienated Kandy's powerful nobility and volatile commoners. The construction of Kandy Lake was completed in 1807. Despite its beauty it was a deeply unpopular project, as it served no practical purpose - central Senkadagala had no paddy fields that required irrigation, the traditional cause for the construction of such hydraulic monuments. In 1810 he removed the powerful Pilima Talauve from the position of Chief Minister (1st Adigar). Talauve rebelled the following year and much to the horror of Kandy's nobles was executed. The king further alienated the powerful Buddhist establishment with arbitrary requisitions of land and treasure. Throughout this period John D'Oyly, a British civil servant, was in close contact with various Sinhala nobles, who increasingly seemed to prefer the rule of the British to the volatile government of the Nayaka monarchy. Second war (1815) The train of events leading directly up to the 1815 war commenced with the humiliation of Ehelepola, Pilima Talauve's nephew and successor as First Adigar. Ehelepola had been involved in several intrigues against the by now deeply unpopular Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe since his appointment in 1810. In 1814 his actions were revealed and the noble fled to British territory. The furious king had Ehelepola's entire family put to death in various gruesome ways. The deaths shocked the Kandyan aristocracy who now openly revolted against the king, who torched his palace and fled to a fortress at Hanguranketha. John d'Oyly, in the meanwhile, had been advising Governor Brownrigg for some time that Kandy's nobles were ready to cooperate with any British attempt at dislodging Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe. Kandyan troops soon crossed the British-Kandyan border seeking Ehelepola, and attacked the British garrison at Sitawaka - of itself enough provocation for Brownrigg to dispatch a force to Kandy. The situation was only worsened by the arrival of a group of British traders who Sri Vikrama Rajasingha had ordered mutilated at Hanguranketha. The British forces met scant resistance and entered Kandy on the 10th of February, 1815, accompanied by John d'Oyly; Brownrigg informed the Admiralty that 'Let by the invitation of the chiefs and welcomed by the acclamations of the people, the forces of His Britannic Majesty, have entered the Kandyan territory and penetrated to the capital. Divine Providence has blessed their efforts with uniform success and complete victory. The ruler of the interior provinces has fallen into their hands and the government remains at the disposal of His Majesty's Representative'. Sometime later Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe's hiding place was discovered; the deposed king was exiled with his harem, to Vellore Fort in India, where he died 17 years later. His son, and potential heir, died childless in 1842. The single most important event following the arrival of British forces in Kandy was the signing of the Kandyan Convention. Essentially a treaty of annexation, it was agreed to in March 1815 after negotiations between John d'Oyly and the nobles of Kandy. The central points of the agreement were: # 'Sri Wickrema Rajasinha', the 'Malabari' king, [is] to forfeit all claims to the throne of Kandy. # The king is declared fallen and deposed and the hereditary claim of his dynasty, abolished and extinguished. # All his male relatives are banished from the island. # The dominion is vested in the sovereign of the British Empire, to be exercised through colonial governors, except in the case of the Adikarams, Disavas, Mohottalas, Korales, Vidanes and other subordinate officers reserving the rights, privileges and powers within their respective ranks. # The religion of Buddhism is declared inviolable and its rights to be maintained and protected. # All forms of physical torture and mutilations are abolished. # The governor alone can sentence a person to death and all capital publishments to take place in the presence of accredited agents of the government. # All civil and criminal justice over Kandyan to be administered according to the established norms and customs of the country, the government reserving to itself the rights of interposition when and where necessary. # Other non-Kandyan's position [is] to remain [as privileged as previously] according to British law. # The proclamation annexing the Three and Four Korales and Sabaragamuwa is repealed. # The dues and revenues to be collected for the King of England as well as for the maintenance of internal establishments in the island. # The Governor alone can facilitate trade and commerce. The signatories of the convention were Governor Brownrigg, Ehelepola and the lords (called 'Dissawes' in Sinhalese) Molligoda, Pilimatalawe the Elder, Pilimatalawa the Younger, Monerawila, Molligoda the Younger, Dullewe, Ratwatte, Millawa, Galgama and Galegoda. The signatures were witnessed by d'Oyly, who became British Resident and effective governor in the area, and his private secretary James Sutherland. The convention is interesting in many ways. It represents the theoretically voluntary transferral of authority in Kandy to the British, and indeed later events showed that the Kandyan nobility did hope that they were simply replacing one malleable master (the Nayakkar monarchy) with another (the British). Indeed, Ehelepola appears to have hoped that the new master would not be the British at all, but himself. The Sri Dalada Maligawa, in Kandy, home to the sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha. The Kandyan Convention afforded Buddhism 'protection', but less than fifty years later the British had constructed a church within the sacred precinct. The nobles and religious potentates of Kandy were also adamant in including clause 5 concerning the protection of Buddhism. Later in 1815 the heads of the Buddhist monasteries at Malwatte and Asgiriya both met Governor Brownrigg and extracted guarantee that Buddhism would not be compromised. This included a ban on proselytising and mission schools. Third war (1817‚Äì1818) It took the ruling families of Kandy less than two years to realise that the authority of the British government was a fundamentally different beast to that of the (deposed) Nayakkar monarchy. Discontent with British activities soon boiled over into open rebellion, commencing in the duchy of Uva in 1817. Generally called the 'Uva Rebellion', it is also known as the Third Kandyan War. In many ways the third name is more appropriate, as the rebellion (which soon developed into a guerilla war of the kind the Kandyans had fought against European powers for some time) was centred on the Kandyan nobility and their unhappiness with developments under British rule since 1815. However it is the last uprising of this kind and Britain's response essentially liquidated the old aristocracy and ensured future rebellions would take on a much more subdued character. The Ceylon Medal was instituted by the Ceylonese Government in 1819, the only gallantry medal struck for the Kandyan Wars. Legacy The British capture of the kingdom of Kandy marked not only the end of the 400-year-old Kingdom of Kandy, but also of all native political independence. Kandy, as a result of its geographical and political isolation, had developed unique cultural and social structures that were now subject to the intense pressures of subjugation and underwent immense upheaval and change. Before 1815, much of Kandy's territory had been underdeveloped with unreliable dirt-track roads for access, apart from a few 'royal roads'. The British proceeded to transform the hill country by constructing roads across previously inaccessible terrain (such as the Kadugannawa Pass), and, in 1867, building the first railway. The other big transformation was the introduction of tea to central Sri Lanka in 1867 and the massive settlement of Tamils in the region. Central Sri Lanka is now dominated by the vast tea estates that helped make Sri Lanka the world's biggest exporter of tea for a while, and were still owned by British companies in 1971. A lasting legacy of the same war in Ireland is the traditional anti- war and anti-recruiting song \\"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\\", depicting a soldier from Athy, County Kildare who comes home horribly mutilated from the war in \\"Sulloon\\" (Ceylon).

It is an umbrella group for Oulipo, Oubapo, Outrapo, etc. The term 'ouvroir', originally used in conjunction with works of charity, was reused by Raymond Queneau for a blend of 'ouvroir' and '≈ìuvre' (\\"work\\") and roughly corresponds to the English 'workshop'. The term 'potentiel' is used in the sense of that \\"which is possible, or realisable if one follows certain rules\\".  History  Created within the Coll√®ge de 'Pataphysique in 1960, Oulipo is now better known than the college itself and has survived the decline of the college. In accordance with the wishes of Fran√ßois Le Lionnais and Raymond Queneau, other Ouvroirs d'X Potentielle have been spun off from Oulipo for all the arts. Each ouvroir is dedicated to some field 'X'. It analyses the pre-existing constraints, and investigates new forms of potential creations within the field. The job of coordinating the ouvroirs was given first to Fran√ßois Le Lionnais, then No√´l Arnaud, and then Milie von Bariter.  The official ouvroirs  After 1960-11-24 when Oulipo was created, thirteen years passed before the appearance of Oulipopo (LItt√©rature POlici√®re, detective literature) in 1973, twenty years before Oupeinpo (PEINture, painting) in 1980, and 31 years before Outrapo (TRAgicom√©die) in 1991, the first ouvroir to be created without Fran√ßois Le Lionnais. Since then, a new ouvroir has arisen almost every year. A list of some Ouxpo groups: *Oubapo, (BAnde dessin√©e, or comics) *Ouhispo, (HIStory) *Oumapo, (MArionnettes) *Ouphopo, (PHOtographie) *Oulipo, (LItt√©rature) *Oulipolipo, (LIbyco POlonais de LItt√©rature) *Ou'inpo, (INformatique, or information technology) *Ouca(ta)po, (CATAstrophe) *Oupypo, ('PYgology') *Ouarchpo, (ARCHitecture) *Oupolpot, (POLitique) *Ougrapo, (design GRAphique) *Oucarpo, (CARtography) Oumupo and Oucipo (MUsique and CIn√©matographie) were created very early, but the dates are uncertain and these ouvroirs probably experienced multiple births. In fact, many Oumupo seem to co-exist. Oucuipo (CUIsine) was created from a fringe activity of Oulipo.  Some others  Ougrapo (GRAmmaire) wants to remain independent of Ouxpo. Some lists mention both an Oumathpo and an Oupornpo. Others, some probably parodies of ouvroirs, include Outyppo (TYPographie), Oupopo (POlitique, again), Oumapo (MAthematique), Oulitramupo (LItt√©rature TRAduite en MUsique), Oupipo (PI√®trerie, from pi√®tre 'mediocre'), Oulipo (but pronounced oulƒ´po, as in Liposuction), Ouecopo (ECOnomy) ‚Äî but these do not appear to be either authentic or members of Ou-X-Po. There exists also an Oucopo (COmique), an Oug√©opo (G√âOgraphie), an Oujapo (JArdinage or gardening), and an Ououpo (OUxpo (meta-oulipo)).

It is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. The Departed stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson, with Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin in supporting roles. The film takes place in Boston. Irish Mob boss Francis \\"Frank\\" Costello (Nicholson) plants Colin Sullivan (Damon) as a mole within the Massachusetts State Police; simultaneously, the police assign undercover state trooper William \\"Billy\\" Costigan (DiCaprio) to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, Sullivan and Costigan each attempt to discover the other's identity before they are found out. The character Colin Sullivan is loosely based on the corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, while the character Frank Costello is based on gangster Whitey Bulger. The Departed was a critical and commercial success, and won several awards, including four Oscars at the 79th Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing, becoming Scorsese's only win for Best Director; Wahlberg was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  Plot  In 1986 South Boston, young Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is introduced to crime by Irish Mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). By 2006, he has groomed Sullivan as a mole inside the Massachusetts State Police (MSP). Sullivan is accepted into its Special Investigations Unit, led by Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), which targets organized crime. Another recruit, William \\"Billy\\" Costigan Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), is approached by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to go undercover before graduating from the MSP's academy, as his family's ties to organized crime make him a perfect infiltrator of Costello's crew. He acts as an MSP academy dropout and serves time in prison on a phony battery and assault charge; he subsequently joins Frank's crew after gaining his attention and proving he is no longer a cop. Ellerby informs Special Investigations that they will not know the identities of Queenan and Dignam's undercover cops, and explains that Costello's crew has stolen computer microprocessors to sell to a Chinese gang. Queenan and Dignam separately inform Billy and they all build their case to arrest Costello. As Billy is accepted as a member of Frank's crew, his mental state declines as a result of his involvement. Queenan and Dignam tell him there is a rat in the Special Investigations Unit and plead with him to stay undercover until the deal takes place. In 2007, Sullivan begins a romance with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Billy also sees her professionally as a condition of his probation and being involved in Frank's crew. The MSP is ready to catch Frank selling the microprocessors, but the deal takes place off-camera and everyone escapes, enraging Ellerby. Frank realizes there is a rat infiltrating his crew. Sullivan, whose relationship with Madolyn is becoming more serious, is promoted to the MSP's Internal Investigations unit and tasked by Frank to find the rat. Sullivan tells him to deliver personal information for all of his crew members so he can cross-reference them in the MSP database. Meanwhile, Billy learns that Costello is an FBI informant. Frank accuses Billy of being the rat, but Billy denies it. He immediately tells Queenan that Frank is an FBI informant, is aware of a mole in his crew, and is becoming increasingly paranoid. Later, Billy follows Frank into an adult movie theater, where he witnesses Frank give Sullivan the envelope containing the information he was asking for. Queenan gives Billy specific instructions to get a visual ID of Sullivan before making the arrest. Billy chases him through Chinatown, but is unable to see his face. When Billy's ringtone goes off, Sullivan realizes he's being followed and prepares to stab Billy, but accidentally kills a civilian. As he runs away, he realizes he and the person following him have been captured on a security camera, but he is unable to recognize Billy on the camera's footage. Sullivan meets with Queenan after his promotion and is advised to follow Costello to find his rat in the police department. Frank waits for a call from Sullivan to find the rat in his crew, and tells Billy to take the day off and miss the upcoming job. Afraid, Billy calls Queenan to meet at an abandoned warehouse. Sullivan orders his officers to have Queenan tailed to the meeting. When Frank's men arrive, Queenan helps Billy escape to preserve his cover before confronting them alone. They drop Queenan to his death before engaging in a brief shootout with police. Sullivan's officers mortally wound crew member Delahunt in the gunfight; at Costello's compound, Delahunt tells Billy he knew he was the mole, and Billy contemplates killing him to keep him quiet moments before he dies. After Delahunt's body was recovered by authorities, television news states that Delahunt had been an undercover cop, but Frank recognizes this as a ploy to protect the real informant. Incensed at learning Sullivan ordered a tail on Queenan, Dignam attacks him and is subsequently suspended by Ellerby; Dignam resigns instead. A vulnerable Billy goes to Madolyn's apartment and they have sex. Using Queenan's phone, Sullivan reaches Billy, who refuses to abort his mission. Sullivan learns from Queenan's diary that Frank is a protected FBI informant, causing him to worry about his own identity being revealed. This warrants Sullivan to finally help the MSP to catch Frank, and with Billy's help, Frank is tailed to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts between the crew and the police. Most of the crew are killed. An enraged Sullivan confronts Frank, who admits he is an FBI informant. When he suddenly draws a gun, Sullivan fatally shoots him and is congratulated as a hero by the police. With Frank dead and the operation wrapped up, Billy goes to Sullivan to restore his true identity. Billy then notices Frank's envelope on Sullivan's desk, realizes Sullivan is the mole, and flees. Sullivan realizes Billy saw the envelope and erases Billy's records from the police computer system to take away his credibility. Billy hands Madolyn an envelope containing the recordings of conversations which incriminate Sullivan as a mole, instructing her to open it only if something happens to him. Meanwhile, Madolyn has moved in with Sullivan and informs him she is pregnant with a son. As Sullivan takes a shower, Madolyn finds a letter addressed to him from Billy. She opens the letter, which also contains the tapes, listens to them, and angrily leaves Sullivan. Billy arranges to meet Sullivan at the building where Queenan died; he handcuffs Sullivan at gunpoint when he arrives. Billy had also called Trooper Brown, a friend of his from the academy, to substantiate his identity, but Brown pulls a gun on Billy when he arrives, unsure who is telling the truth; Billy says he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello's operations, and Brown reluctantly lets him go down the elevator. Upon reaching the lobby, Billy is shot and killed by Trooper Barrigan from Special Investigations, who also kills Brown before revealing himself as a second mole working for Costello. Sullivan shoots Barrigan dead and publicly frames him as the only mole, clearing his own name. At Billy's funeral, Sullivan notices that Madolyn is tearful. As they leave the cemetery, he approaches her and asks \\"what about the baby?\\" but she ignores him and keeps walking. Later, Sullivan arrives at his apartment, but Dignam is waiting there and kills him. As Dignam leaves, a rat races across the balcony.

William Monahan was secured as a screenwriter, and later Martin Scorsese, who admired Monahan's script, came on board as director. In March 2004, United Press International announced that Scorsese would be remaking Infernal Affairs and setting it in Boston, and Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were slated to star. Pitt, tentatively scheduled to play Sullivan, later declined to play the role, saying a younger actor should play the part; he decided to produce the film instead. Scorsese's associate Kenneth Lonergan suggested Matt Damon, who grew up in Boston, for the part of Sullivan, and Scorsese asked Jack Nicholson to play Costello. Nicholson wanted the film to have \\"something a little more\\" than the usual gangster film, and screenwriter Monahan came up with the idea of basing the Costello character on Irish-American gangster Whitey Bulger. This gave the screenplay an element of realism ‚Äì and an element of dangerous uncertainty, because of the wide-ranging carte blanche the FBI gave Bulger in exchange for revealing information about fellow gangsters. A technical consultant on the film was Tom Duffy, who had served three decades on the Boston Police Department, particularly as an undercover detective investigating the Irish mob. The Departed was officially greenlit by Warners in early 2005 and began shooting in the spring of 2005. Some of the film was shot on location in Boston. For budgetary and logistical reasons many scenes, in particular interiors, were shot in locations and sets in New York City, which had tax incentives for filmmakers that Boston at the time did not.  Themes and motifs  Film critic Stanley Kauffmann said that for The Departed, Scorsese \\"was apparently concerned with the idea of identity, one of the ancient themes of drama, and how it affects one‚Äôs actions, emotions, self- knowledge, even dreams.\\" Kaufmann, however, did not find the theme conveyed with particular effectiveness in the film. The father-son relationship is a motif throughout the film. Costello acts as a father figure to both Sullivan and Costigan, while Queenan acts as Costello's foil in the role of a father figure. Sullivan addresses Costello as \\"Dad\\" whenever he calls to inform him of police activities. In the final scene, a rat is seen on Sullivan's window ledge. Scorsese acknowledges that while it is not meant to be taken literally, it somewhat symbolizes the \\"quest for the rat\\" in the film and the strong sense of distrust among the characters, much like post-9/11 U.S. The window view behind the rat is a nod to gangster films like Little Caesar (1931), Scarface (1932), and White Heat (1949). Note the x-shaped structure, as depicted in the film. Throughout the film, Scorsese uses an \\"X\\" motif to foreshadow death in a manner similar to Howard Hawks' classic film Scarface (1932). Examples include (but are not limited to) shots of cross-beam supports in an airport walkway when Costigan is phoning Sgt. Dignam, the taped windows of the building Queenan enters before being thrown to his death, behind Costigan's head in the elevator before he is shot, and the carpeted hallway floor when Sullivan returns to his apartment before being shot by Dignam at the film's end.  Reception = Box office  The Departed grossed $132.4 million in the United States and Canada and $159 million in other territories for a total gross of $291.5 million, against a production budget of $90 million. The film grossed $26.9 million in its opening weekend, becoming the third Scorsese film to debut at number one. In the following three weeks the film grossed $19 million, $13.5 million and $9.8 million, finishing second at the box office each time, before grossing $7.7 million and dropping to 5th in its fifth week.  Critical response  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 91% approval rating based on 278 reviews, with an average rating of 8.25/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Featuring outstanding work from an excellent cast, The Departed is a thoroughly engrossing gangster drama with the gritty authenticity and soupy morality we come to expect from Martin Scorsese.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 85 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade \\"Best of\\" list, saying: \\"If they're lucky, directors make one classic film in their career. Martin Scorsese has one per decade (Taxi Driver in the '70s, Raging Bull in the '80s, Goodfellas in the '90s). His 2006 Irish Mafia masterpiece kept the streak alive.\\" Online critic James Berardinelli awarded the film four stars out of four, praising it as \\"an American epic tragedy.\\" He went on to claim that the film deserves to be ranked alongside Scorsese's past successes, including Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Andrew Lau, the co-director of Infernal Affairs, who was interviewed by Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily, said: \\"Of course I think the version I made is better, but the Hollywood version is pretty good too. [Scorsese] made the Hollywood version more attuned to American culture.\\" Andy Lau, one of the main actors in Infernal Affairs, when asked how the movie compares to the original, said: \\"The Departed was too long and it felt as if Hollywood had combined all three Infernal Affairs movies together.\\" Although Lau said the script of the remake had some \\"golden quotes\\", he also felt it had a bit too much profanity. He ultimately rated The Departed 8/10 and said that the Hollywood remake is worth a view, though according to Lau's spokeswoman Alice Tam, he felt that the combination of the two female characters into one in The Departed was not as good as the original storyline. A few critics were disappointed in the film, including J. Hoberman of the Village Voice, who wrote: \\"Infernal Affairs was surprisingly cool and effectively restrained for HK action, but Scorsese raises the temperature with every ultraviolent interaction. The surplus of belligerence and slur reach near-Tarantinian levels‚Äîappropriate as he‚Äôs staking a claim to QT‚Äôs turf.\\"  Top ten lists  The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2006. Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer, Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal, Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle, and Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it one of the top ten films of 2006. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times named it the best film of the 2000s. * 1st ‚Äì Richard Roeper, Ebert and Roeper * 1st ‚Äì Peter Travers, Rolling Stone * 1st ‚Äì Rene Rodriguez, The Miami Herald * 1st ‚Äì Scott Tobias, The A.V.

At the 79th Academy Awards on February 25, 2007, The Departed won four Academy Awards: Best Picture (Graham King), Best Director (Martin Scorsese), Best Film Editing (Thelma Schoonmaker), and Best Adapted Screenplay Writing (William Monahan). Mark Wahlberg was also nominated for the Best Supporting Actor award for his performance, but he lost to Alan Arkin for his role in Little Miss Sunshine. The film marked the first time Scorsese won an Oscar after six previous losses. Many felt that he deserved it years earlier for prior efforts. Some have even gone further, calling it a Lifetime Achievement Award for a lesser film. Scorsese himself joked that he won because: \\"This is the first movie I've done with a plot.\\" While accepting the award, Scorsese stated that \\"I just want to say, too, that so many people over the years have been wishing this for me, strangers, you know. I go walking in the street people say something to me, I go in a doctor's office, I go in a...whatever...elevators, people are saying, \\"You should win one, you should win one.\\" I go for an x-ray, \\"You should win one.\\" And I'm saying, \\"Thank you.\\" And then friends of mine over the years and friends who are here tonight are wishing this for me and my family. I thank you. This is for you.\\" At the 11th Satellite Awards on December 18, 2006, The Departed won awards for Best Ensemble, Motion Picture, Best Motion Picture, Drama, Best Screenplay ‚Äì Adapted (William Monahan), and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Leonardo DiCaprio). In 2008, it was nominated for the American Film Institute Top 10 Gangster Films list  Home media  The Departed was released by Warner Brothers on DVD in 2007. The film is available in a single-disc full screen (1.33:1), single-disc widescreen (2.40:1) edition, and 2-disc special edition. The second disc contains deleted scenes; a feature about the influence of New York‚Äôs Little Italy on Scorsese; a Turner Classic Movies profile; and a 21-minute documentary titled Stranger Than Fiction: The True Story of Whitey Bulger, Southie and The Departed about the crimes that influenced Scorsese in creating the film, including the story of James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, upon whom Jack Nicholson's character is based. The Region 1 version has three available audio tracks: English, Spanish, and French (all of which are in Dolby Digital 5.1), and three subtitle tracks (English, Spanish, French). The film was released on HD DVD and Blu-ray at the same time as the standard-definition DVD. The 2-Disc Special Edition was packaged in a Limited Edition Steelbook. It marked the first time that an Oscar-winning Best Picture was released to the home video market in DVD format only, as VHS was phased out by the start of 2006.  Music  There were two albums released for The Departed, one presenting the original score composed for the film by Howard Shore, and the other featuring earlier recordings, mostly pop/rock songs, which were used on the soundtrack.  Soundtrack  As with previous Scorsese films, Robbie Robertson had a hand in picking the music. The film opens with \\"Gimme Shelter\\" by The Rolling Stones (\\"Let It Loose\\" also appears later on), and prominently plays \\"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\\" by Dropkick Murphys with lyrics written by Woody Guthrie, which gained the band some popularity and their first and only platinum-selling single. The film features the live version of Pink Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb\\" from the 1990 Berlin Wall concert performed by Roger Waters, Van Morrison, and Rick Danko, Levon Helm, and Garth Hudson of The Band. Although \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is featured twice in the film, the song does not appear on the album soundtrack. Also heard in the movie but not featured on the soundtrack is \\"Thief's Theme\\" by Nas, \\"Well Well Well\\" by John Lennon, \\"Bang Bang\\" by Joe Cuba, and the Act II Sextet from Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. The film closes with a cover of Don Gibson's \\"Sweet Dreams\\", by Roy Buchanan.  Score  The film score for The Departed was written by Howard Shore and performed by guitarists Sharon Isbin, G. E. Smith, Larry Saltzman and Marc Ribot. The score was recorded in Shore's own studio in New York State. The album, The Departed: Original Score, was released December 5, 2006 by New Line, and produced by Jason Cienkus. Scorsese described the music as \\"a very dangerous and lethal tango\\" and cited the guitar-based score of Murder by Contract and the zither in The Third Man as inspiration.  Cancelled sequel  Although many of the key characters in the film are dead by the movie's end, there was a script written for a sequel. This was ultimately shelved due to the expense and Scorsese's lack of interest in creating a sequel.

The park is named after Father Louis Hennepin, a priest who visited the area with a French expedition in 1680. The park has 103 campsites and a sandy beach over one mile (1.6 km) long. Wildlife Hawks, ospreys, owls, and eagles are common raptors found in this park. Mammalian tracks of beaver, raccoon, mink and deer are often seen by visitors in the soft earth or snow. Northern pike, walleye, bluegills, sunfish and bass swim around this park's lake. The aspen stands and small clearings are set up for ruffed grouse. Squirrels and chipmunks thrive in maple and oak stands. The small ponds and streams provide homes for amphibians and insects, which in turn attract larger fish, birds and mammals. Cultural history Father Louis Hennepin, a Franciscan priest of the Recollet order, was dispatched to explore western New France in 1680. Hennepin is not thought to have been in the exact location of the park, but the park is named after him because he was the first to write extensively about the Mille Lacs area. He called the area Louisiana in honor of King Louis XIV of France. In the spring of 1680 he and two companions encountered a group of Dakota Native Americans and were captured, about from today's Father Hennepin State Park. Their release was negotiated eight months later by Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut. Throughout the experience, Father Hennepin kept a journal describing the lakes, rivers, landscapes, and the lifestyle of his hosts, the Mdewakanton Dakota. In 1683 his writings were published in the book Description de la Louisiane. Local advocates and Catholic groups were instrumental in getting the park established in the years before World War II. The Minnesota Legislature was reluctant to fund a new park, but when of tax-forfeited land were acquired at little cost, Father Hennepin State Memorial Park was authorized in 1941. However a provision was inserted into the bill barring any state funds from supporting the park for the first five years. County and local funds only went so far, and the park remained largely undeveloped until 1953 when the Minnesota state park system instituted an entrance fee. References *Meyer, Roy W.

A dunun is a rope-tuned cylindrical drum with a rawhide skin at both ends, most commonly cow or goat. The drum is played with a stick. Depending on the region, a plain straight stick, curved stick with flat head (similar to the stick used for a tama), or a straight stick with a cylindrical head attached at right angles near one end may be used to strike the skin. Traditionally, the drum is played horizontally (placed on a stand or worn with a shoulder strap). For a right-handed player, the right hand plays the skin and the left hand optionally plays a bell that may be mounted on top of the drum or held in the left hand. The latter style is popular in Mali and originally from the Khassonk√© people. Three different sizes of dunun are commonly played in West Africa. *The dundunba (also spelled dununba) is the largest dunun and has the lowest pitch. Typical size is 60-70 cm (24-28 in) in length and 40-50 cm (16-20 in) in diameter. \\"Ba\\" means \\"big\\" in the Malink√© language, so \\"dundunba\\" literally means \\"big dunun\\". *The sangban is of medium size, with higher pitch than the dundunba. Typical size is 50-60 cm (20-24 in) in length and 30-40 cm (12-16 in) in diameter. * The kenkeni is the smallest dunun and has the highest pitch. Typical size is 45-50 cm (18-20 in) in length and 25-35 cm (10-14 in) in diameter. Dunun are always played in an ensemble with one or more djembes. Nomenclature The names of the drums are onomatopoeic, meaning that they sound like the thing they describe. This is common for West African instruments. Shekere (gourd rattle), sege sege (metal djembe rattle), kese kese (woven basket rattle), and kenken (a bell played with dunun) are Malink√© onomatopoeic terms for other instruments that are commonly played together with dunun and djembe. Dundunba, sangban, kenkeni, kensedeni, and kensereni are Malink√© terms. (Kensedeni and kensereni are synonyms for kenkeni.) In Mali and northeast Guinea, the dundunba and sangban are often both referred to as jeli-dunun (also spelled djeli-dunun) because they were traditionally played by the jelis (French: griots). Among the Bamana people in Mali, the dundunba is known as khassonka dunun and the sangban is known as konkoni (played without a bell). There, the drums are headed with goatskin instead of the cowskin used elsewhere. The name djun djun is a common western misnomer. There is no such word in the Malink√© language and this term should not be used. A dunun player is generically known as a dununfola (literally, \\"one who plays dunun\\"). Specifically, the kenkeni, sangban, and dununba players are referred to as kenkenifola, sangbanfola, and dununbafola, respectively. The drum is also not to be confused with the d√πnd√∫n, a type of talking drum used by the Yoruba people. Techniques Dundunba from The Gambia There are two primary playing styles for dununs. The traditional style or Mandingue style has each player using a single drum resting on its side, either on the floor or on a stand, and striking the head with one mallet and a bell mounted on top with the other. A melody is created across the interplay of the three dununs. For the other style, known as ballet style as it is used in the National Ballets, one player has command of the three dununs standing on the floor, allowing a more complex arrangement for the dance. There are wide variations on how the dunun is played throughout West Africa. In Mali they are sometimes played with just one dunun and a bell that is held in the hand. In some regions of Guinea the dunun is played with no bells, or only two dunun are played. In some regions of Mali up to five dununs are played at the same time. In Hamanah, (Guinea) three dununs with bells are played. This style is one of the most known in the west, due to the influence of Mamady Ke√Øta, Famoudou Konat√©, Mohamed Diaby, Bolokada Conde, and other players from Guinea. It is formed of three dununs of different sizes; the kenkeni (smallest), sangban (medium) and dununba (largest). The kenkeni has the highest pitch and usually holds the rhythm together with a simple pattern. The sangban typically has a more complex part which defines the rhythm. The dununba often serves to add depth with deep, widely spaced notes. These drums provide a rhythmic and melodic base for the djembe ensemble. In Bamako (Mali), a style of playing with two dunun developed. Both so called konkoni, have goat skin and are played without the bell. The konkoni with the highest pitch keeps the accompanying rhythm and the konkoni with the lowest pitch keeps the lead melody and solos. In the Khassonk√© region of Mali, the biggest of the dununs has the leading role - making solos and leading the song.

It was among the first concert hall compositions for percussion ensemble alone, although Alexander Tcherepnin had composed an entire movement for percussion alone in his Symphony No. 1 from 1927. The premiere was at Carnegie Chapter Hall, an annex to New York City's Carnegie Hall, on March 6, 1933, conducted by Nicolas Slonimsky, to whom the piece was later dedicated. One critic described the performance as \\"a sock in the jaw.\\" Music Ionisation features the expansion and variation of rhythmic cells, and the title refers to the ionization of molecules. As the composer later described, \\"I was not influenced by composers as much as by natural objects and physical phenomena.\\" (Schuller 1965, p. 34) Var√®se also acknowledged the influence of the Italian Futurist artists Luigi Russolo and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in the composition of this work. Both Chou Wen-Chung and Jean- Charles Fran√ßois have analyzed the structure and timbre features of Ionisation in detail. Andr√°s Wilheim has noted that only the last 17 measures of Ionisation include musical tones of the \\"traditional tonal system\\", where any five successive chords contain the 12 tones of the chromatic scale. Frank Zappa often claimed that Ionisation inspired him to pursue a career in music, as it was supposedly the first album he purchased. Jack Skurnick, director of EMS Recordings, produced early post-war recordings of Var√®se; this piece appears on the first Var√®se LP, EMS 401: Complete Works of Edgar Var√®se, Volume 1. Ionisation had also been the first work by Var√®se to be recorded in the 1930s, conducted by Nicolas Slonimsky and issued on 78rpm Columbia 4095M. The players for the recording included, in addition to the composer himself on the sirens, Carlos Salzedo on Chinese blocks, Paul Creston on anvils, Wallingford Riegger on guiro, Henry Cowell on piano, and William Schuman on the lion's roar.Nicolas Slonimsky, Perfect Pitch, p. 138 Octandre was also recorded and issued on 78rpm discs in the later 1930s, complete (New Music Quarterly Recordings 1411) and as an excerpt (3rd movement, Columbia DB1791 in Volume V of their History of Music). Sidney Finkelstein wrote in the LP liner notes about the work: > [Ionisation] is built on a most sensitive handling and contrast of different > kinds of percussive sounds. There are those indefinite in pitch, like the > bass drum, snare drum, wood blocks, and cymbals; those of relatively > definite musical pitch, such as the piano and chimes; those of continually > moving pitch, like the sirens and 'lion's roar.'

This is a Surah which deals with questions regarding Muhammad's wives. Name of the Surah The Surah derived its name from the words lima tuharrimu of the very first verse. This too is not a title of its subject matter, but the name implies that it is the Surah in which the incident of tahrim (prohibition, forbiddance) has been mentioned.http://tanzil.net/#66:1 Probable date of revelation In connection with the incident of tahrim referred to in this Surah, the traditions of the Hadith mention two ladies who were among the wives of Muhammad at that time Safiyya bint Huyayy and Maria al-Qibtiyya. The former (i. e. Safiyyah) was taken to wife by Muhammad after the conquest of Khaiber, and Khaiber was conquered, as has been unanimously reported, in A. H. 7. The other lady, Mariyah, had been presented to Muhammad by Al-Muqawqis, the ruler of Egypt, in A. H. 7 and she had borne him his son, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, in Dhu al-Hijjah, A. H. 8. These historical events almost precisely determine that this Surah was sent down some time during A.H. 7Muhammad Asad - The Message of The Qur'an - (1980), an influential translation and interpretation of the Qur'an or A. H 8.Abul A'la Maududi - Tafhim-ul-QuranAl-Zamakhshari Asbab al-nuzul AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l, an Arabic term meaning \\"occasions/circumstances of revelation\\", is a secondary genre of Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir) directed at establishing the context in which specific verses of the Qur'an were revealed. Though of some use in reconstructing the Qur'an's historicity, asbƒÅb is by nature an exegetical rather than a historiographical genre, and as such usually associates the verses it explicates with general situations rather than specific events. According to Sale, the occasion of this chapter was as follows: ‚ÄúThere are some who suppose this passage to have been occasioned by Muhammad‚Äôs protesting never to eat honey any more, because, having once eaten some in the apartment of Hafsa bint Umar or of Zaynab bint Jahsh, three other of his wives, namely, Aisha, Sawda bint Zam øa, and Safiyya bint Huyayy, all told him they smelt he had been eating of the juice which distils from certain shrubs in those parts, and resembles honey in taste and consistence, but is of a very strong savour, and which the Prophet had a great aversion to.‚ÄùGeorge Sale - Mohammed, The Quran, vol. 4 [1896] Muhammad al-Bukhari recorded that Aisha narrated : Theme & Subject Matter A Pakistani Muslim theologian, Quran scholar, Islamic modernist, exegete and educationist Javed Ahmad Ghamidi (born 1951) summarize the theme of the surah as follows: Hadith The first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur'an is found in hadith of Muhammad.≈ûatibi, El- muvafakat Although scholars including ibn Taymiyyah claim that Muhammad has commented on the whole of the Qur'an, others including Ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives, thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the Qur'an.Muhsin Demirci, Tefsir Usul√º, 120 ·∏§adƒ´th (ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´) is literally \\"speech\\" or \\"report\\", that is a recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with Sirah Rasul Allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah.

Ibn Abbas is known for his knowledge of traditions as well as his critical interpretation of the Qur'an. From early on, he gathered information from other companions of Muhammad and gave classes and wrote commentaries. * Sa'id ibn Jubayr narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said: \\"A man came to him and said: 'I have made my wife forbidden to myself.' He said: 'You are lying, she is not forbidden to you.' Then he recited this Verse: 'O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.'(At-Tahrim) (And he said): 'You have to offer the severest form of expiation: Freeing a slave.'\\"Sunan an-Nasa'i 3420 In-book reference : Book 27, Hadith 32 English translation : Vol. 4, Book 27, Hadith 3449 Placement & Coherence with other surahs The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as nazm and munasabah in non-English literature and coherence, text relations, intertextuality, and unity in English literature.

I don't, it's never occurred to me.\\" =Zell Miller= Days later, then-U.S. Senator Zell Miller, (D-Georgia), a Democrat who supported then-Republican President George W. Bush, appeared on Hardball. Miller had just given the keynote address at the Republican convention. Matthews took Miller to task for his statement that soldiers, not reporters, are responsible for freedom of the press, accusing the senator of making the comment only \\"to get an applause line against the media at a conservative convention.\\" Miller had also criticized Kerry's record on national defense issues during his speech, prompting Matthews to ask if the senator believed that Kerry did not want to \\"defend the country.\\" During a heated exchange in which each man interrupted the other several times, Miller shouted at Matthews to \\"get out of my face\\" and angrily stated that he wished \\"we lived in the day where you could challenge a person to a duel.\\" He also made reference to the Malkin interview, telling Matthews not to \\"pull that stuff on me like you did that young lady, when you had her there browbeating her to death. I'm not her.\\" =Ann Coulter and Elizabeth Edwards= On June 26, 2007, conservative commentator Ann Coulter was the guest when Elizabeth Edwards, wife of then- Democratic Presidential candidate John Edwards, made a surprise (per Coulter, afterwards) call to the program. Coulter had made a speech days earlier in which she said, \\"I was going to have a few comments on the other Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, but it turns out you have to go into rehab if you use the word 'faggot'.\\" Elizabeth Edwards confronted Coulter about the comment, as well as other comments Coulter had made accusing John Edwards of exploiting his son's death for political gain. Edwards asked Coulter to \\"stop the personal attacks\\" and accused her of \\"lowering the political dialogue\\" in America. Coulter responded that Edwards' complaints were an attempt to raise money for the presidential campaign, and questioned why the candidate himself was not making the call.Elizabeth Edwards vs. Ann Coulter - First Read MSNBC.com =Kevin James= On May 15, 2008, Matthews had a confrontation with radio broadcaster Kevin James when he appeared on the show. At issue was a controversial speech made by President George W. Bush in Israel, where he appeared to claim that statements made by United States presidential candidate Barack Obama were tantamount to Neville Chamberlain's actions of \\"Nazi appeasement\\" in 1938. James agreed with the notion that Obama's positions were like Chamberlain's policy of appeasement but was unable to elaborate on what exactly Chamberlain did.Video Clip Appearance from NBC News's Hardball depicting Chris Matthews with Kevin James In popular culture The show has been spoofed by Saturday Night Live, with Darrell Hammond portraying Chris Matthews. One of the first instances was during the Florida election recount, following the unclear results of the 2000 United States presidential election. Hardball appeared on the October 9, 2005 episode of The West Wing, \\"Message of the Week\\" (which was written by frequent Hardball guest Lawrence O'Donnell), with Chris Matthews playing himself. He interviews fictional Republican presidential candidate Arnold Vinick (played by Alan Alda) and pressures him about his views on immigration. The tough nature of Matthews' questions prompts the character of Josh Lyman, a strategist for Vinick's opponent, to shout: \\"Yeah! Welcome to Hardball, Arnie!\\" The show was featured in the February 22, 2007 30 Rock episode \\"Hard Ball\\", in which series character Jenna Maroney came on the show to explain about how she was misquoted in Maxim magazine about US military troops. She embarrassed herself even further when she confused Barack Obama with Osama bin Laden, after she mentioned whom she would support for U.S. president in 2008. The 2008 film Swing Vote contains several segments of Chris Matthews delivering commentary on Hardball that relates to the film's plot line. Matthews received a credited cameo for recording the segments.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1027862/fullcredits#cast The Hardball Award The Hardball Award is an award created in 2009 that recognizes an individual \\"who displays a combination of guts and political moxie to win not just the day but our fondest admiration.\\" The award is not given on a regular basis; instead, it is given when someone displays character consistent with the award.

Wood Wharf is a 23 acrehttps://group.canarywharf.com/portfolio/wood-wharf/ Wood Wharf, Canary Wharf Group PLC, Retrieved 26 April 2018 site in Canary Wharf, London. It is currently under construction to provide offices, residential homes and retail space. The site is next to Canary Wharf. Wood Wharf will contain 5 million square feet of space, which will include 2 million sq ft of office space, 3,330 residential homes, 3.6 hectares (8.9 acres) of public spaces, and 380,000 sq ft of shops, restaurants and space for community use. It is estimated to be completed in 2023. The architects for the site include Allies and Morrison, Darling Associates, KPF, Herzog & de Meuron, Pilbrow & Partners, Stanton Williams Architects, Grid Architects, and Patel Taylor. The masterplan has been designed by Allies and Morrison Architects. Site history The Wood Wharf Business Park was sold by British Waterways to a joint partnership in the financial year 2007-08. The Canal & River Trust is the freeholder of the main site following the transfer of all the assets of British Waterways in 2012. British Waterways had previously acquired the site from the Port of London. Canary Wharf Group plc purchased a 250-year lease for the site in January 2012. First masterplan In 2003, British Waterways issued a masterplan for a substantial, mixed used redevelopment of the site. The masterplan indicated a potential development size of commercial floorspace (offices, retail and restaurants), of residential use (approximately 1,500 units) and of hotel and serviced apartments. The masterplan has been adopted by Tower Hamlets as interim guidance to support the current local plan.  Development  During 2004, British Waterways held a competition to select a development partner for the project. In 2005, a consortium of British Waterways, Canary Wharf Group and Ballymore Properties established the Wood Wharf Partnership to develop the scheme with Berwin Leighton Paisner as legal advisors. In November 2007, a new master plan was unveiled, by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners.Wood Wharf https://www.rsh-p.com/projects/wood-wharf/ Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners LLP, Retrieved 26 April 2018Masterplanning 2017, Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, https://www.rsh-p.com/assets/publications/RSHP_masterplanning.pdf Retrieved 26 April 2018 Outline planning was submitted to Tower Hamlets in July 2008 and were approved in October 2008. The official Wood Wharf website was updated. The new master plan shows considerably higher density, as well as more towers, which are also taller than the previous ones. The next step is to find different architects to design each individual building. The developers want at least one iconic residential, and one iconic office tower as part of the project. The new master plan also contains a high street, which will run up the middle of the site. This will host bars, shops, caf√©s and restaurants. This will be covered by a glass snake-skin type roof. A planning application was filed on 30 June 2008. On 8 October 2008, Tower Hamlets Strategic Development Committee voted unanimously to grant approval for the application. Canary Wharf Group, which is a 25% partner in Wood Wharf project, does not wish to proceed with the scheme until it has completed and let all of the office projects on and around the original Canary Wharf Estate, including Riverside South, North Quay, Heron Quays West, and 25 Bank Street. In January 2012, Canary Wharf Group took 100% control of the project by paying British Waterways ¬£52.5m for their 50% stake and Ballymore ¬£38m for their 25% stake. Under the agreement Canary Wharf Group has been a granted a new 250-year lease from British Waterways with ground rent payable which will grow to ¬£6m per annum. In September 2012, Terry Farrell was appointed to replace Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners in leading the development of the masterplanning. Second masterplan In January 2013, Herzog & de Meuron, Allies and Morrison and Stanton Williams were appointed as architects for various elements of the scheme. In December 2013, a new masterplan was submitted to Tower Hamlets by Canary Wharf Group, which placed greater emphases on residential uses compared to the previous plans. Approval In July 2014, Tower Hamlets council granted planning permission to construct 30 buildings, comprising 4.9m square feet of homes, offices and shops (planning reference PA/13/02966). Work on the Wood Wharf site is expected to start in autumn 2014, with the first buildings occupied at the end of 2018. In December 2014, it was announced that Boris Johnson had approved the scheme to include \\"around 25% of the new homes created in the scheme will be affordable homes whilst a review mechanism has been agreed to increase this allocation to around 40% affordable housing\\".

He was Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum of the University of Oxford, and also served as Vicegerent of Wolfson College, Oxford. Early life Moorey was educated at Mill Hill School, then an all- boys independent boarding school. He studied modern history at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Between school and university he did his National Service in the Intelligence Corps, learning Russian and serving in Cyprus. Career His time in Cyprus (with its fine archaeological heritage) probably reinforced a childhood interest in ancient history and may well have prompted his interest in the post of Assistant Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum which became available at the time of his graduation in 1961. He was eventually appointed as Keeper of Antiquities, which post he remained in until his retirement in 2003, shortly before his death. Moorey's excavation interests and experiences were broad, excavating at Jerusalem under Kathleen Kenyon in 1963 and in Abu Salabikh in Iraq under Nicholas Postgate in the 1970s.

There are several English names under which the surah is known. These include ‚ÄúThe Inevitable Hour‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Indubitable‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Inevitable Truth‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe Reality‚Äù. These titles are derived from alternate translations of al-·∏§ƒÅqqa, the word that appears in the first three ayat of the sura. Though each of these titles may sound very different, each one alludes to the main theme of the sura ‚Äì the Day of Judgment.  Historical context  Al-·∏§ƒÅqqa is a Meccan sura,Carl Ernst How to Read the Qur'an p. 216 meaning it was revealed to the prophet while he lived in Mecca as opposed to Medina. Meccan suras divided into early, middle, and late periods. Theodor N√∂ldeke in his chronology of suras places the sura to be revealed in the early Meccan period.  Theme and Subject Matter  The Surah tells about the destiny of Thamud,  øƒÄd, Pharaoh, other toppled towns, the flood that came in the hour of Prophet Noah. It discusses the prize of the steadfast and the punishment of the disbelievers. At last, it reminds the individuals that this message isn't the verse of a poet or something made up by the Prophet himself, it is the revelation of the Lord of the universes.Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiqi 69:1-3 The day of resurrection The first passage of the surah contains three ayaat. These 3 ayaat portray the day of resurrection and the day of judgementMuhammad Asad and emphasize that The judgment of God will infallibly come.George Sale \\"Haaqqa\\", referring to the Quranic view of the end time and eschatology. \\"Haaqqa\\" has been translated to Reality,Marmaduke Pickthall Inevitable Hour,Mustafa Khattab Translation laying-bare of the truth, etc. According to Ibn Kathir, a traditionalistic exegete, Al-Haaqqa is one of the names of the Day of Judgement, like Al-Qaria, At-Tammah, As-Sakhkhah and others.Tafsir ibn Kathir Rhetorically Al-Haaqqa has 2 similarities with Al-Qaria(101). Firstly the opening of the surah resembles Al-Qaria(101) which opens with the wordings 69:1 ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéÿßŸÇŸéŸëÿ©Ÿè 69:2 ŸÖŸéÿß ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéÿßŸÇŸéŸëÿ©Ÿè 69:3 ŸàŸéŸÖŸéÿß ÿ£ŸéÿØŸíÿ±ŸéÿßŸÉŸé ŸÖŸéÿß ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéÿßŸÇŸéŸëÿ©Ÿè Notice that Al-Qaria opens in exactly same style http://tanzil.net/#101:1 101:1 ÿßŸÑŸíŸÇŸéÿßÿ±ŸêÿπŸéÿ©Ÿè 101:2 ŸÖŸéÿß ÿßŸÑŸíŸÇŸéÿßÿ±ŸêÿπŸéÿ©Ÿè 101:3 ŸàŸéŸÖŸéÿß ÿ£ŸéÿØŸíÿ±ŸéÿßŸÉŸé ŸÖŸéÿß ÿßŸÑŸíŸÇŸéÿßÿ±ŸêÿπŸéÿ©Ÿè Secondly, word Al-Qaria appears as a total of 5 times in Quran and out of which thrice it is mentioned in Al- Qaria(101) while once it appears in Al-Haaqqa as well.http://corpus.quran.com/wordmorphology.jsp?location=(69:4:4) 69:4-8 Thamud and  øƒÄd, ancient tribes  The 2nd passage of the surah contains 4 ayaat. These ayaat exemplify the history of ancient tribes Thamud and  øƒÄd. Particulars of the pre-Islamic tribes of 'Ad and Thamud have been discussed in Quran elsewhere as well.The Message of The Qur'an Mention of  øƒÄd occurs 24 timeshttp://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3AEaAd2+pos%3Apn in total while the people of Thamud are mentioned 26 timeshttp://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3Avamuwd+pos%3Apn in the whole Quran. Both of these tribes rejected the Prophets so they were destroyed by the wrath of ALLAH. The surah not only remind the history lesson but also re- narrate the specifics of how the final destruction was struck upon these aforementioned nations. Thus the tone of this surah displays the anger towards the attitude of disbelievers and the discourse makes it more and more clear as we move forward along the text. In 8th ayat, the Quran asks a direct emphatic question from the audience of the Quran, \\"Do you see any of them left alive ?\\" Q69:9-12 Pharaoh's crime These 4 ayaat carry the continued tonality of warning by reminding examples and thus mention Pharaoh's crime.http://tanzil.net/#69:9 According to Tafsirs, the subverted cities mentioned in the 9th ayat refer to Sodom and Gomorrah i.e the people of the prophet Lut. The text of the ayaat 11th and 12th are loaded with references, so their literal word to word translation needs adequate annotation. Rephrasing and aiding the original text with commentary illustrate the meanings as follows: \\"Similarly, as a consequence of denying Noah\\" when the flood rose high, it was We(ALMIGHTY) who carried you(your ancestors)Note:Cf.69:6 upon the ark.To make this \\"account\\" a reminder for you and that retaining ears may hear and retain it.Translation and commentary by Javed Ahmad Ghamidi Alluding to the punishment of evildoers and the saving grace bestowed upon the righteous.Note:Cf.69:7 Sale sums this up as; \\"As the flood came, so shall the judgment certainly come\\"Mohammed, A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran: Comprising Sale‚Äôs Translation and Preliminary Discourse, with Additional Notes and Emendations (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, and Co., 1896). 4 vols. Q69:13-18 one of the names of Qiyamah The discourse of the surah now returns to the topic of opening verse. The first three verses announced one of the names of Qiyamah, asked what it is, and how would you know about it. Next 9 ayaat then reminded of (at least) 5 ancient nations, their negligence towards their Messengers, and consequently their punishment. Notice that all of these were worldly punishments; before the Last Judgment. Now the imagery of Qiyamah and Afterlife is depicted in ayaat 13th to 37th.http://tanzil.net/#69:37 Ayaat 13th to 17th features the affects of Trumpet of Israfil i.e; its single blow sound will cause cosmic chaos and catastrophe. A picturesque depiction of mountains & earth lifted from their original space and then being smashed and destroyed, and sky being torn apart is portrayed. The polytheists are informed that the angels whom they view as divinities and expect that they will mediate for them before God will themselves be in a condition of uneasiness when the incredible disturbance happens and will pull back to the fringe of the sky. According to the text of the surah, people will be able to see 8 Angels; Bearers of the Throne carrying the throne of Allah. And then Quran asserts that all of the deeds of a person will be exposed no matter how secretly he did them. Q69:19-37 Reward and punishment This passage explains the fortunate people and their reward, and unfortunate people and their punishment. The good and bad shall receive their account-books and be judged according to their deeds. The linguistic symbolism of \\"right\\" and \\"left\\" as \\"righteous\\" and \\"unrighteous\\" is explained here. In 19th ayat \\"haa\\" is a particle of interjection, or added demonstrative particle-like in haa-huna Quran - Al Imran (3:154) or haa-antum. Quran - Al Imran (3:66) Which means that it shows the expression and exclamation of joy, like English counterpart \\"yeah\\".http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=1261&Itemid;=125Nouman Ali Khanhttps://archive.org/details/TafseerOfQuranByNoumanAliKhan/69.Al- haqqah8-24.mp3 The righteous person will be overjoyed when he gets his record in his right hand and will show it to his companions. This is also mentioned in surah Al-Inshiqaq \\"He will return to his kinsfolk rejoicing\\".Quran Al- Inshiqaq (84:9) Adding to the exclamation of joy, he will be explaining that he was lucky because he had been conscious of the Hereafter in worldly life and had carried on with his existence with the conviction that he would need to show up before God one day and render his record to Him.Abul A'la Maududi - Tafhim-ul-Quran This ideology of a righteous person is evident elsewhere in Quran as well; i.e \\"(They are those) who are certain that they are going to meet their Lord\\".Quran - Al-Baqarah (2:46) Implying that he had always been conscious of resurrection and judgment, and had tried to behave accordingly. Then the fruits of Paradise are mentioned as rewards of the righteous that orchards will be at a height and lofty, yet their fruits and bunches will bend low in easy reach for those who want to consume them. The first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur'an is found in hadith of Muhammad.≈ûatibi, El- muvafakat ·∏§adƒ´th (ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´) is literally \\"speech\\" or \\"report\\", that is a recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with Sirah Rasul Allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah.

He will ask him: \\"Do you confess?\\" He will say: \\"O Lord, I confess.\\" This will continue as long as Allah wills, then He will say: \\"I concealed them for you in the world, and I forgive you for them today.\\" Then he will be given the scroll of his good deeds, or his record, in his right hand.

He will be given his book in the left hand, he will be expressing his dejectedness by a deathwish of death which precedes with no accountability, he would express his feelings openly of not being aware of his account and accountability. He would complain that his worldly wealth and authority is of no use now. Handing over the record in the left hand and his displayed lamentation will then be followed by the punishment of getting shackled in a chain whose length has been mentioned to be detrimental. And his sins are declared in 34th and 35th ayaat that he did not believe in ALLAH and did not encourage to feed the poor despite the fact he confessed to being a wealthy person in the previous ayat. Then the picturization of his punishment continues that neither he would have any company nor any food. The only food available for such people would be the pus of their own wounds. > The actual word is ÿ∫Ÿêÿ≥€°ŸÑŸê€å€°ŸÜ.

This surah consist of 2 rukus. The 2nd one consist of ayaat from 38th upto the end of the surah and the pericope talks about the prophet Muhammad. > The disbelievers of Mecca are addressed and told: \\"You think this Qur'an is > the word of a poet or soothsayer, whereas it is a Revelation sent down by > Allah, which is being presented by His noble Rasool.
