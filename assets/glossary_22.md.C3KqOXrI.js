It was first held in 1933 and was held a further five times between 1934 and 1984. The tour did not take place from the outbreak of the Spanish civil war in 1936, until the end of the second world war in 1945. In 1986, it became a regular annual race. The final professional edition of the race was held in 2000. In 2002, after a year's hiatus, the race returned to the calendar as an amateur race.  History  The first Vuelta a Galicia occurred in 1933 between August 9th and 13th. Villalba‚Äôs (Vilalba) local newspaper, Faro Villalb√©s, reported on the race. There were 33 initial competitors and eight were from the region of Galicia. The race started in Vigo and the cyclists covered 195 kilometers to Orense, averaging about 31 kilometers per hour. The second stage started with 29 competitors going from Orense to Lugo covering 125 kilometers and the cyclists averaged about 21 kilometers per hour. On the third day, the competitors cycled 105 kilometers from Lugo to Ribadeo with the winner of this stage arriving in 3 hours, 18 minutes and 50 seconds. The next stage, the fourth, the cyclist rode 153 kilometers from Ribadeo to Ferrol, averaging 28 kilometers an hour. See article for order of arrival by the first 7 cyclists. In the fifth stage, the cyclists started in El Ferrol, traveled through Jubia (Xubia), Puentes de Garc√≠a Rodriguez, Cabreiros, Villalba (Vilalba), Trasparga Guitiriz, San Julian de Coir√≥s, Betanzos, Esp√≠ritu Santo and ending in La Coru√±a. On the sixth stage the cyclists rode 237 kilometers from La Coru√±a to Pontevedra. In the final stage only 19 cyclists remained, riding 120 kilometers from Pontevedra to Vigo. The winner was Cardona, finishing at 41 hours, 28 minutes and 5 seconds. The winning purse was 3,000 pesetas which equates to about $320 dollars, in 1933.

See \\"Claimed Age\\". ‚Äì 1957) was an American former slave freed in 1865 after the American Civil War. Born in Charlottesville, Virginia, he worked as a laborer for most of his life, moving in 1881 from Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. He was interviewed in June 1949 about his life by the Library of Congress as part of the Federal Writers' Project of former slaves' oral histories. The recorded interview is online through the Library of Congress and the World Digital Library. Fountain was a grandson of Wormley Hughes and Ursula Granger, and great-great-grandson of Betty Hemings, the slave matriarch at Monticello. Wormley Hughes and his family were enslaved by President Thomas Jefferson at the time of his death. Background and early life After Thomas Jefferson's death, Wormley Hughes (who had worked as a gardener) was among a group of slaves who were \\"given their time.\\" This was an informal freedom, a non-legally binding release from the demands of enslavement without legal release, awarded usually to respective members of the slave-holder's own enslaved descendants and, at times, to other slaves deemed to have shown especially dedicated service. Despite this, Hughes' wife Ursula and all their children were sold in 1827, along with all but five slaves from Monticello, to settle outstanding debts of the estate. Hughes appealed to Jefferson's grandson to try to keep his family together; Thomas Jefferson Randolph purchased Hughes' wife and his three sons and took them with Wormley to his plantation of Edgehill. Three daughters of Hughes were sold ultimately to people in Missouri and Mississippi; others stayed closer.\\"Hughes (Hemings)\\", Getting Word, Monticello Foundation, see Descendant charts, accessed 26 May 2013 Fountain Hughes was born near Charlottesville, Virginia. He states that his grandfather was enslaved by Thomas Jefferson. His father was killed in the American Civil War. As a child, Hughes was sometimes sent as a messenger to another house and would carry a pass to show he was allowed to travel. He said none of the enslaved boys were given shoes until they were about 12 or 13; they always went barefoot. He describes moments when his feet bled due to not being able to wear shoes. He also said that boys also had to wear dresses like woman, they were not given any pants or shoes until the age of about 12 or 13. He described sleeping on pallets on the floor of their quarters; they did not have beds until after freedom. After being freed, he worked for a dollar a month. Later life Hughes in 1952 Hughes moved to Baltimore in 1881. For a time, he worked as a manure hauler for a man named Reed. A recorded interview was conducted with him on June 11, 1949, by Hermond Norwood (a Library of Congress engineer at the time).\\"Voices from the Days of Slavery\\", Library of Congress American Memory.

He said that in the 1940s, many people bought things on credit instead of saving up for them. He said, \\"If I've wanted anything, I'd wait until I got the money and I paid for it cash.\\" He also said that, when he was growing up in the 19th century, young people could not spend money until they were 21 because they would be suspected of stealing the money. Children never had money to spend on their own. When asked which life he preferred, Hughes said he would rather be dead than a slave again. Hughes died in 1957. Claimed age While Hughes' year of birth has been deduced to be circa 1848 from claims made by him in a recorded interview 8 years before his death and at least one newspaper article 5 years before his death, there is no primary record documentation of this claim.

In the United States, it ranges throughout the southern Midwest, the South, and as far northeast as New York, but has recently been spotted in southwest Ontario. A single female specimen has also been reported from Dryden, Maine. Polistes metricus is dark colored, with yellow tarsi and black tibia. Nests of Polistes metricus can be found attached to the sides of buildings, trees, and shrubbery. [Nesting habits of P. metricus] Like other Polistes species, P. metricus, has evolved eusociality and demonstrates behaviors including nestmate discrimination and local mate competition. Like the other members of the order Hymenoptera, Polistes metricus has a haplodiploid genetic system. Nests of P. metricus have distinct characteristics like the ability to share nests with other Polistes species and reuse nests multiple seasons. Another distinction is that Polistes metricus foragers take off from their nests depending on how long their trip will be. For short flights, they exit the nest flying horizontally, while for long flights, they exit the nest flying straight up into a high altitude before pursuing their direction. P. metricus prefers to consume soft-bodied prey, especially caterpillars. P. metricus has been known as P. pallipes. Taxonomy This species was described by Thomas Say in 1831. Rau referred to this species as Polistes pallipes in a number of his publications. P. metricus is found to be most closely related to P. carolina. The most recent phylogenetic analysis shows that both share a common ancestor with P. bellicosus. Description and identification P. metricus has a dark ferruginous (rusty) color with black markings on its thorax and a mostly black abdomen. Its tibia is black, and the tarsi are yellow. A black spot, separate from the antennae, contains the three ocelli. Females bear six abdominal segments, while males bear seven.\\"Paper Wasp.\\" Project Noah. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Nov. 2013. Swelled parts of the abdomen of this species are a key defining element. In the female, extensive rust-red coloration occurs on her head and mesosoma. Female P. metricus yellow markings are very limited in area. The mesosoma has a large spread of red color, and the metasoma shows black coloration. P. metricus also has an especially marked outward bend in sternum 2; however, this is often a very subtle characteristic. In the male, the red coloring takes up less area, but black coloration takes up more area. The male has more yellow markings than the female and a yellow color on his entire face and the pronotal carina. The yellow coloration on the legs of the male is highly variable in this species. The smallest of the larvae can be told apart from eggs by noticing the darker anterior end of larvae. In the nests of P. metricus, cells that are capped are most likely cells that contain pupae. After pupae emerge from their cocoons, they leave behind evidence of their metamorphosis in the form of cocoon shavings. Distribution and habitat The distribution of P. metricus is largely limited to North America. P. metricus has been spotted in the far southwestern reaches of Ontario, Canada. In the eastern United States, one female was seen in Dryden, Maine and recorded by the Canadian Nursery Certification Institute for pest control. This was a novel sighting for Maine, and probably indicated the beginnings of the spread of P. metricus into Maine. Other states where P. metricus is known to be located are on the east coast of the US, including New York, Pennsylvania, and the area from the southern part of Michigan all the way south to Florida; and the area westward to Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and the eastern part of Texas. Specifically, P. metricus has been studied in Brazos Bend State Park in Texas along with other wasp species, including Polistes bellicosus. =Preferred nesting sites= P. metricus chooses its nesting sites based on shelter from the elements, size, lighting, and sources of water. It tends to build its nests in sheds and barns and on the underside of eaves. It especially prefers large and well-lit nesting locations. Its nests are mixed with those of P. fuscatus on a regular basis, and locations where one of them is present tend to also contain the nests of the other species, in close proximity to each other. P. metricus likes to use large bodies of water, such as ponds, as sources of water. In the summer, they frequently make trips to water sources for hydration. Colony cycle =Overview of the colony cycle= The colony cycle begins in May and ends by October. The establishment of new P. metricus nests begins in early May, and this is typically performed by only one female; however, observed cases of colonies initiated by an association of foundresses have been observed. The colony slowly and gradually increases in size, and the average date for the first worker of the nest to emerge from its cocoon is in middle July. In July, the entire brood of workers emerges from its cocoons and this is also when the maximum rate of egg-laying of the year occurs. The next brood develops into males and reproductive females, and in September, these individuals also emerge from their cocoons. The survival of broods is reduced by parasitism from pyralid moths. The colony cycle typically ends by October. At this point, reproductive females leave their nests for hibernacula, locations where they spend the winter, and all males die. =Nest construction= Before July, nest construction surges ahead rapidly and the count of brood cells and the size of the nest both increase significantly. This period of speedy growth coincides with the emergence of the first brood of workers. Therefore, construction requires the input of workers. After July, the rate of cell building falls. It is rare to observe any vacant cells in the nest until late June. This is perhaps due to the queen's rate of oviposition being high enough to ensure all new cells get filled. However, due to the more rapid rate of construction between June and July, vacant cells begin to appear and become more numerous. This higher construction rate produces new cells faster than the queen's rate of oviposition. Then, in July and August, the number of vacant cells stays approximately constant. The rate of cell construction is the same as the queen's rate of oviposition. After August, vacant cell number increases significantly as the queen's oviposition slows down. Polistes metricus has nests which grow slowly as the solitary founder may cannibalize eggs.Hunt, James, H. (2007). The Evolution of Social Wasps. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, Inc. =Egg production= The rate of egg production fluctuates throughout the colony cycle. In May, the median egg count is greater than in early June. The yearly maximum point for the egg count occurs in July; egg production then decreases steadily to zero by September. Once the first brood of worker eggs has been laid, the queen decreases her rate of oviposition as this brood matures. Once they are mature, the queen stops laying eggs. In late June and July, the queen recommences laying eggs and her rate of oviposition increases once more. If the queen is killed, removed, or dies, workers can take over the responsibility of oviposition. In fact, 22% of an emerging brood comes from eggs that were not laid by the initial queen. Surprisingly, the final period of decreasing oviposition rate is not due to old age or mortality of the queen. It is actually due to ovarian diapause that occurs throughout the entire female population of the colony. =Larvae and pupae populations= Two peaks occur in the number of larvae present in the colony. The first peak occurs in early June, coming right after the peak egg count. The second, highest peak of the larval population happens in July at exactly the same time as the highest peak in the egg count. This is probably so closely matching because eggs hatch into larvae very quickly in July, when the temperature is high. The median count of larvae decreases slightly in August and then rapidly decreases to nothing (zero) in September. The speedy fall in larval population happens because larvae pupate, and late in the season there is increased parasitism of larvae and brood destruction wrought by the adult wasps. In early June, the first pupae appear. Compared to eggs and larvae, the pupal population seems to only have one maximum. The pupal instar has a duration of 18‚Äì26 days for P. metricus. =Adult female and male population= In the beginning of the nesting season, the adult population typically contains only one adult female, the reproductive foundress. Cooperative co-founding of nests was once considered to be rare for P. metricus, but it now appears that this is becoming more common. Like eggs and larvae, the adult wasp population of P. metricus has two maxima. The first peak occurs in July and corresponds to the emergence of the first brood of workers. These workers used to be pupae in late June, and were also the first peaks of the eggs and larvae. The year's maximum count of adult females and males is in September. This is the last brood of adults and the females in this group become the next season's foundresses and overwinter in hibernacula. Foraging flights P. metricus has a very distinctive foraging behavior compared to other wasps. Adults search for prey in low-level vegetation, shrubs, and trees. When they embark on long flights, they tend to have trees as their destination. Their pattern of flight when leaving the nest reflects the nature of their journey, as if they already know in advance the distance that their flight will take. When they wish to fly short distances, they exit the nest with a horizontal trajectory, just above the upper edges of the vegetation, and usually between 1.0 and 1.5 m above the ground level. When their flight involves greater distances, they leave the nest, flying 3 to 4 m above the ground when flight distance is about 10‚Äì15 m. Extremely long flights greater than or 100 m involve the wasp flying at high altitude, measured at 17 m, and these wasps make their climb very quickly upon taking off from the nest. In the summer, reproductive females (gynes) fly significantly shorter distances to forage then do their worker counterparts. When a P. metricus wasp locates prey, she typically will return to the same location and search the same sites at the location on future foraging trips. This is probably because predation by P. metricus is not sufficient to dramatically reduce the prey population at the site. Compared to other paper wasps, P. metricus tends to forage over longer distances. This may be due to less tolerance of P. metricus for prey scarcity, or that when prey is scarce, P. metricus is inefficient at capturing prey. On a longer flight, once an abundant source of prey is detected, P. metricus can efficiently forage for the long-distance prey. Longer flights are facilitated by the greater average size of P. metricus compared to other paper wasp species. Malaxation Malaxation is an act performed by an adult wasp that involves grabbing an insect or piece of an insect, then chewing and crushing it with the mandibles (typically at the same time inverting it and spinning it with the fore legs) until it is a pulpy consistency. This final product is usually then fed directly to larvae. In P. metricus, females mix fructose into the morsel that they malaxate. During the process of malaxation, adults feed themselves from the liquid or semisolid material that they extract from the provision morsel. For most wasps, malaxating prey is rare and only occurs when not enough nectar or honeydew is in the environment. Since P. metricus has a longer lifespan than other wasps and engage in an exceptionally lengthy period of reproduction, it malaxates prey and consumes the protein for its metabolic needs. Malaxation typically takes place on the order of one to several minutes. =Larval provisioning= A specific routine sequence of larval provisioning behavior occurs in females of P. metricus. First, the female malaxates the morsel to be fed to the larva. During this process, solid and liquid materials from the morsel are extracted by the female and stored in her crop, from where it can be regurgitated to larvae during mouth-to-mouth trophallaxis. The female regurgitates the solid extractions from the morsel directly into the mouth of the larva. She then grooms for a period. After grooming, she resumes feeding the larva and regurgitates the liquid portions of the morsel into the larval mouth, after which she once again grooms. During regurgitation, most of the contents of the crop may be released, or the female can choose to withhold a significant portion of it. The female thereby simultaneously feeds both the larva and herself during malaxation. =Larval feeding by males= Males also can feed larvae in P. metricus. At the end of the nesting season, known as the ‚Äúlate season‚Äù, P. metricus females destroy both the nest and the brood, including eggs, larvae, and pupae. While late-season brood termination is normal for P. metricus, it is less common to see brood termination in the middle of the nesting season. This occurs in response to parasitic infections. Not all of the brood is destroyed. In this case, the adults females malaxate the brood that they destroy and feed it to the remaining brood. During one of these events. somewhat astonishingly, an adult male P. metricus was observed to malaxate a larva and feed a fragment of this to a surviving larva. More commonly, males of P. metricus have the general habits of malaxating pieces of food and consuming some of these pieces while discarding the rest without feeding any larvae. Food abundance and food scarcity =Effect of honey supplementation on individuals= Having excess honey has effects on individuals in a colony. If colonies are supplemented with extra honey, offspring tend to emerge from pupation earlier than usual. They also tend to have greater percentages of noncuticular body fat. When wasps have a higher noncuticular fat content, it also means that they have higher capacities for reproduction. In fact, some experiments show that increasing noncuticular body fat directly results in increased reproductive potential. While in nature, the first emerging broods of P. metricus are known to have relatively skimpy amounts of body fat, surprisingly, after honey supplementation, the first brood of workers exhibits even higher body fat than their foundresses. This suggests that in nature, colonies are typically restricted by limits on food availability during the pre-emergence phase of the nesting cycle, when only the single foundress and possible co-foundresses are available to forage for provisions for the worker brood. In general, it is common for P. metricus to store honey over the winter. The amount of honey stored and the length of time for which it is stored show variation in different years, providing evidence that honey storage depends on changing factors in the environment. =Effect of supplementation and starvation on the colony= If a colony is supplemented with extra honey, it will not affect its long-term survival, but it will change the colony's demographics. Colonies that receive extra honey tend to build more cells in their nests and produce more pupae. However, the total count of adult females does not show significant change. Honey-supplemented colonies produce more offspring overall, but more of these offspring become reproductives due to their high fat content and thus leave the nest, leaving behind a smaller number of workers than normal at the nest. The biggest changes in colony demographics occur if there are significant changes in the early and middle periods of the nesting cycle. When nourishment is systematically decreased for a brood in the larval stage, the entire colony changes as response. After two weeks of larval starvation, the foundress tends to abandon the colony, resulting in the failure and death of the colony. In response to larval starvation, most colonies cease nest construction. Fewer larvae reach the pupal stage than normal. Dynamics of reproduction =Male egg production= Whenever foundresses are present, workers are restricted from producing male eggs. The most dominant foundress in an association of co- foundresses is known as the Œ±-foundress, who shares a portion of reproduction with the other Œ≤-foundresses. The Œ±-foundresses takes the lion's share of reproduction, laying 78% of the colony females and 87% of the males. All foundresses are known to mate with males at least twice in their lifetimes, and they use the sperm from these two males in a 9:1 ratio with the majority of fertilizations provided by one male's set of sperm. If all of a nest's foundresses are dead or eliminated, two workers take up the responsibility of laying male eggs. One of these two workers is dominant over the other and lays 19 times more male eggs. No parental care is necessary for pupae, and pupae develop into adults on their own. In P. metricus, inbreeding is exceedingly rare. Associations of co-foundresses are generally composed of half or full sisters that came from the same natal nest the previous season. =Foundress mortality= Once the first brood of workers emerges from the nest, foundresses stop leaving the nest. There is a two-day refractory period in which no work is done, and then the workers take over the responsibility of foraging for the nest. From this point forward, foundress mortality is zero for the rest of the egg-laying season. However, if one starts to observe that only males are emerging from the nest, it can be assumed that all the foundresses of the colony have died approximately 47 days earlier. These males would not have been produced by the foundresses, but instead by their worker daughters, who have since taken over egg-laying and produce only male eggs. On the condition that the foundresses die after the first brood of workers has already become pupae, then there is still a good chance that the colony will survive, since pupae do not require any adult maintenance or feeding and will develop on their own. If the foundresses die before pupation of any workers, then the colony is doomed to failure because the brood will die of starvation. In the event of foundress mortality, the overall productivity of the nest declines, most likely because of the loss of parental care from the foundresses before worker care begins. In general, foundress mortality tends to be great in the period between nest initiation and the emergence of the first brood of workers. The death of any one foundress results in the proportional increase in the contribution of the other foundresses to the colony's reproduction. Ecology =Predators= Polistes metricus is subject to predation by birds, spiders, ants, and deer mice. Birds attack the P. metricus nest by puncturing its lateral margin and removing the pupae and larger larvae. =Prey= Polistes wasps including P. metricus prey on Lepidopteran larvae (i.e. caterpillars) most frequently. They are considered generalist predators. Polistes also eat other insects. P. metricus prefers to prey upon soft-bodied prey such as caterpillars and the larvae of tenthredinids and chrysomelids. Manipulation by parental feedings has been hypothesized to play a role in the development of larvae. The proponents of the hypothesis argue that the well fed larvae grow to be reproductive adults. However, it was found that parent manipulation of the brood is not done in Polistes metricus. =Parasites= Parasitoids and parasites of Polistes metricus tend to affect the colony at different stages in their development. It has been shown that C. pegasalis is able to infect a colony at any stage except the egg stage. C. pegasalis prefers to infect colonies that have larvae and pupae. X. peckii is similar because it prefers to parasitize larvae and pupae. In contrast, X. peckii can infect any stage of development. Infestations of Xenos parasites happen frequently in Georgia. Polistes metricus head structure The nests of this wasp are parasitised by the parasitoid caterpillars of the pyralid moth Chalcoela iphitalis which feed on the wasp larvae and pupas at night, spinning their cocoons in empty cells. Behavior =Eusociality= In order to differentiate female workers from female reproductive wasps in Polistes metricus, behavior must be studied since they are morphologically similar. Female reproductives are referred to as queens or foundresses. The reproductive queens have more developed ovaries compared to the workers. Consequently, female Polistes have the ability to be reproductive depending on the social and physical environment they occupy. Polistes metricus is considered to be a eusocial organism, characterized by sterile castes, overlapping generations, and cooperative care for offspring.Davies, Nicholas B.; Krebs, John R.; West, Stuart A.

Polistes metricus, like Polistes dominula and Polistes annularis, differs from many other advanced eusocial insects in that the distinction between reproductive females and non-reproductive females is subtle. =Deviation from 1:1 sex ratio= Polistes metricus has been shown to demonstrate a deviation from Fisher's prediction of a 1:1 male to female sex ratio. Despite the equal parental investment in the sexes, the average frequency for females in Polistes metricus is approximately .55. In most species that deviate from a 1:1 sex ratio, there is a degree of sexual dimorphism, with the more common sex being smaller. Polistes metricus follows this trend, with females being smaller than males on average. =Haplodiploidy= Like other insects of the order Hymenoptera, Polistes metricus has a haplodiploid genetic system.Mahowald, Michael, and Eric Von Wettberg. \\"Sex Determination in Hymenoptera.\\" Sex Determination in Hymenoptera. N.p., n.d. Web. 15 Sept. 2013. When a queen's eggs are fertilized, they produce diploid daughters; unfertilized eggs produce haploid male offspring.Davies, Nicholas B.; Krebs, John R.; West, Stuart A. (2012-02-17). An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology (Kindle Locations 6379-6381). Wiley. Kindle Edition. Consequently, in colonies with a monogamous queen, females are more closely related to their sisters than to their brothers, mothers, or future offspring. It has been argued that, due to the 3/4 relatedness between haplodiploid sisters, there exists a conflict between the queen and her female offspring. Robert A. Metcalf argues that data on the skewed sex ratios does not prove or disprove the hypothesis of parent- offspring conflict over male production and parental investment. Metcalf's study shows that the foundresses control the production of males by restricting sperm availability to workers. The importance of haplodiploidy in terms of the evolution of eusociality was brought into question using a phylogenetic study of Polistes by Pickett et al. The paper argues that through a phylogenetic test they found that there is little support for the idea the haplodiploidy lead to early social evolution in the genus Polistes. =Local mate competition= In a population that has a female biased sex ratio, according to W. D. Hamilton, there could be Local Mate Competition, or LMC. Local Mate Competition occurs in female biased populations because brothers must compete with each other for mates. These mates might be their sisters; therefore, inbreeding should be higher in these populations. Robert A. Metcalf's study of inbreeding in both Polistes metricus and P. variatus using phenotypic differences found that there were no signs of inbreeding in either population. According to Metcalf's research, the lack of inbreeding in Polistes metricus makes it unlikely that LMC occurs. Additionally, there has been research that shows that some populations produce only male reproductives. This occurs when the queen dies and the workers lay eggs. The female workers are not fertilized so they produce males who are haploid. Effects of resources =Local resource enhancement, size, and reproductive ability= Food supplementation and access to food does not affect the number or the sizes of worker offspring. This could suggest that there is not the adaptive advantage to make larger workers. Stabilizing selection is present to make a fixed number of workers regardless of nest size or food availability. The selection shifts toward the production of more sexual females than larger males. The colonies that are supplemented with food also produced more reproductive females than larger reproductive females which suggests that female sexual production in resource limited conditions is very expensive. Males however, are slightly larger on average which could mean that the number of males produced is not as critical as male size. It has been proposed that larger males helps the colony by attacking foreign males, and defending nest territory.Seal, J.N., and J.H. Hunt. \\"Food Supplementation Affects Colony- level Life History Traits in the Annual Social Wasp Polistes Metricus (Hymenoptera, Vespidae).\\" Insectes Sociaux 51.3 (2004): n. pag. Print. Nutrient level of certain macro and micronutrients varies throughout the life history of the organism. There are few large differences in nutrient levels between workers and gynes; however, gynes process lipids differently by retaining them. On the other hand, the differences in nutrient levels in reproductive larvae and non-reproductive larvae are strong. Additionally, nutrient levels does not change throughout the lifetime of both male and females Polistes metricus. Based on these observations, the nutrient level at the larval stage tends to correlate with the reproductive ability of the larvae as it develops.Judd, Timothy M., Roxane M. Magnus, and Matthew P. Fasnacht. \\"A Nutritional Profile of the Social Wasp Polistes Metricus: Differences in Nutrient Levels between Castes and Changes within Castes during the Annual Life Cycle.\\" Journal of Insect Physiology 56.1 (2010): 42‚Äì56. Print. Increased food resources have also been shown to lead to an increase in the production of gynes at the expense of worker production.Karsai, Istv√°n, and James H. Hunt. \\"Food Quantity AffectTraits of Offspring in the Paper Wasp(Hymenoptera: Vespidae).\\" Environmental Entomology 31.1 (2002): 99-106. Print. Nest characteristics =Nest sharing and nest reutilization= In certain locations across the United States, such as eastern Kansas, individual foundresses of Polistes metricus can maintain more than one nest or even share a nest with another foundress. In cases where multiple nests are maintained by a single foundress, males are not produced. This phenomenon is due in part to the extensive parasitism found in eastern Kansas. Chalcoela iphitalis is a parasitic moth that is commonly found in the nests of Polistes metricus. It is not known why Polistes metricus has evolved this behavior. It has been proposed that the behaviors are able to limit the chance of reproductive failure for any one foundress. In some situations, it has been observed that a nest is shared between two species of Polistes. One case is the sharing of a nest by Polistes metricus and Polistes fuscatus. The different species of wasps were seen to coexist without conflict. The evolutionary significance of joint nesting is unclear. Proposed hypotheses include the fact that it might represent the beginning stages of interspecific mutualism or exploitation. Nest reuse has been observed in Polistes metricus species. It is common for a foundress to use the nest multiple times within a reproductive season. However, it is very unlikely for foundresses of any species to return to a nest in a subsequent season. =Nest founding= Adult female Polistes use their salivary enzymes to soften wood or paper products to form a nest pedicel. The adult female foundress or foundresses will then begin to build the nest cells. They will also lay eggs. In colonies with multiple foundresses, one will become dominant and lay the most eggs. Once the first worker develops, the nest moves from the founding phase into the worker phase. Following the worker phase is the reproductive stage, where the dominant foundress loosens her control over the other colony members and the workers lay sterile male eggs. The period in between the reproductive phase and the founding phase of the next season is the intermediate phase. Adult female gynes and adult males leave the nest to mate.Reeve, H. K. 1991. Polistes. Pp, 99-148. In K.G. Ross and R.W. Matthews (eds.) The social biology of wasps. Comstock, Ithaca, NY. =Nestmate discrimination= It has been suggested that Polistes metricus females discriminate between nestmates and non-nestmates using genetically determined cues regarding food, nesting materials, or nest site. These genetically predetermined cues have been found in Lasioglossum zephrym, a species of bee at a similar social level. Polistes metricus gynes can detect and work with former nestmates without being inside the nest in which they were born. In situations where there is no nest, nestmates are more tolerant of each other than are nestmates in Polistes metricus. Former nestmates are often assumed to be sisters or other close relatives. Nestmate discrimination does not occur in workers or non-reproductives, which could suggest a relationship between nestmate discrimination, nutrient availability, and the environment.https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/hodges_amanda_c_200212_phd.pdf =Multiple foundress colonies= In Polistes metricus, colonies with more than one queen are aptly named multiple foundress colonies. It is beneficial for a colony to have many foundresses because they can protect the nest from usurpers, parasites, and help rebuild the nest if it is destroyed. It has been shown that individuals in multiple foundress colonies spend less time at the nest compared to individuals in single foundress colonies. The dominance hierarchy in multiple foundress colonies consists of the dominant foundress at the top, and subordinate foundresses beneath her. Gynes and worker wasps make up the base of the hierarchy. Dominant foundresses in multiple foundress colonies forage for wood, pulp, and nectar, while subordinate foundresses take long foraging trips and return with the majority of the sustenance for the colony. Foundress mortality increases after the workers emerge. Also, less dominant foundresses are often kicked out of the nest prior to the laying of eggs that will become reproductive. It is improbable that subordinate foundresses will become dominant. Lastly, if a subordinate foundress lays eggs, the dominant foundress will often consume them. Based on the subordinate foundresses status in a multiple foundress colony, it may appear to be better for her to create a new colony of her own. However, creating a new colony is more difficult to do than waiting to displace the queen. It has also been proposed that natural selection favors foundresses that have offspring that are a mixture of dominant foundresses and workers.

Constructed in a motte-and-bailey design, the castle had two baileys, rather than the usual one, and originally had two large enclosures beyond the baileys.Pettifer, p.26. In the 12th century it was surrounded by a low artificial lake, fed by the brook to the west, and could only be accessed by causeways.Creighton, p.14. De Conyers built the castle during a dispute with William Cumin, who laid claim to be the Bishop of Durham; de Conyers supported Cumin's rival, William of St. Barbara.Pettifer, p.26. Historian Lise Hull believes that the licence to crenellate given to de Conyers for his castle may be the first recorded instance of this in England,Hull (2006), p.128. but Philip Davis rejects the licence on the grounds that the fortification was a matter of necessity rather than consent, and that the supposed licence contains no indicative wording. In later years the castle became owned directly by the Bishop of Durham, a powerful regional landowner.Brickstock, p.38. The mound was one of twenty investigated by the Round Mounds Project during 2015 and 2016, looking for possible pre-historic mounds that had been re-used as Norman motts. A 10cm diameter core sample was taken, running from the top of the mound down to below the original ground level, with Radiocarbon dating of the buried material. The great majority of the mounds investigated confirmed a Norman construction, with no sign of a previous earthwork. This was the case at the Bishopton mound, where a Norman date was confirmed. It also identified that the raised causeway on the north side was a secondary feature, which had not been part of the original construction.

It received generally positive reviews from critics.  Plot  \\"Generation P\\" follows the strange adventures of Babylen Tatarsky as he evolves from a disillusioned young man in the drab days of post-communist Moscow to the chief ‚Äúcreative‚Äù behind the virtual world of Russian politics. When Babylen was a Young Pioneer, his generation received a gift from the decaying Soviet state in the form of a bottle of Pepsi, of Russian manufacture. Not just a beverage, it was also a symbol of hope that some day a new, magical life would arrive from the other side of the ocean. The arrival of this life, and the way it transformed these ex-Pioneers, is what the film is about. In the early Nineties, Tatarsky, a frustrated poet, takes a job as an advertising copywriter, and discovers a knack for putting a distinctively Russian twist on Western-style ads. But the deeper Tatarsky sinks into the advertising world, the more he wonders if he has sacrificed too much for money. His soaring success leads him into a surreal world of spin doctors, gangsters, drug trips, and the spirit of Che Guevara who, via a Ouija Board, imparts to him the dazzling theory of WOWism, about how television destroys the individual spirit. Though named in honor of Lenin, Babylen opts instead to believe in his ‚ÄúBabylonian‚Äù destiny, and secretly searches for the beautiful goddess Ishtar, who becomes for him a symbol of fortune. Meanwhile, the people around Babylen - clients, colleagues - perish in the violent dog-eat-dog world of new Russian capitalism. In Nineties Moscow, this is taken as the ordinary course of daily affairs. Tatarsky is invited to join an all-powerful PR firm run by a cynically ruthless advertising genius, Leonid Azadovsky, who invites Tatarsky to participate in a secret process of rigged elections and false political advertising. And as a result of his brilliance, Tatarsky achieves the ultimate, as he creates and gets elected a \\"virtual\\" president. But like Faust selling his soul to the devil, this ex-humanist gradually descends to the level of a reprobate, finding that he no longer belongs to himself, but is trapped in a virtual world of his own creation. Babylen returns to his Buddhist friend Gireyev and takes hallucinogenic mushrooms, in attempt to re- create his previous experience. In a ritualistic Sumerian initiation, Babylen replaces Azadovsky as head of the Agency and becomes the earthly husband of Goddess Ishtar, the object of his obsession. There, he is offered control of the mechanism that produces ‚Äúsimple human happiness‚Äù - and can control the world. Themes Generation P explores the philosophical theme of man‚Äôs identity in the modern branded world, and that‚Äôs the substance of the film - but not its tone. Babylen Tatarsky's story is also a hallucinatory fun ride, a quest for gold, of how to make it in today¬πs world, of the head-spinning rise to power, and of the fall from grace. Ginzburg said, \\"I was interested in seeing the border between real and virtual in Babylen's world gradually disappear, ultimately bringing the viewer to a place I hope they will recognize as the world we all live in today.\\" The film makes no compromises with the political absurdities of modern Russia and how the Nineties set the stage for the Putin era and the emergence of the Russian corporate state, with its control of mass media, and virtual politicians that get elected. Production =Filming= In 2006 Ginzburg dedicated himself to the writing and directing of Generation P and soon discovered the reluctance on the part of the Russian film industry to finance such an expensive non-genre film. Applications for government subsidy, that the majority of Russian films receive, were rejected. Television networks were skeptical. Although the movie was completed and released under the auspices of the Gorky Film Studio, Ginzburg was forced to finance the film independently and raise $7 million, which accounts for it taking five years (2006‚Äì11) to reach theaters. In the process, the production ran out of money three times, including the financial crisis of 2008. It was at the \\"rough cut\\" stage that the film was seen by Konstantin Ernst from Channel One, who immediately made decision to buy the TV premiere. A surprise hit of the spring and summer of 2011, Victor Ginzburg‚Äôs Generation P has proven wrong those who thought Pelevin‚Äôs 1999 seminal novel about the rise of the advertising industry in Post-Soviet Russia was simply unfilmable. =Cinematography= Ginzburg chose Aleksei Rodionov as cinematographer, whose work ranges from the classic war epic Come and See to the adaptation of Virginia Woolf's famous novel Orlando. Rodionov was nominated for a number of prestigious Russian awards for his work on Generation P:ru:–†–æ–¥–∏–æ–Ω–æ–≤, –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å–æ–≤–∏—á =Musical score= Ginzburg chose composers Kaveh Cohen, Michael Nielson and composer/musician Alexander Hacke to write original music for the movie. Sergey Shnurov a legendary Russian punk rock musician who played Buddhist monk Gireev also contributed to the film's soundtrack. Russian Release The Russian film industry avoids provocative political and social issues because it's financed by the government and state- owned TV networks. Generation P poked sharp satire at the current Russian political system and the virtuality of its leaders. There was real fear on the part of the distributor \\"Karo\\", that Generation P will not be granted the \\"distribution license\\" due to foul language and politics, including scenes with \\"banned\\" oligarch Berezovsky and scenes of Putin-like virtual president. But after four years in stop and go independent production, over a million views of the film's trailers on YouTube and much press, the buzz was so strong - the Facebook group alone generated over 40 thousand followers, mostly progressive Russians - that nobody could stop the release. Generation P was released in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan on April 14, 2011. It was #3 in the Russian Box Office after the first weekend with a total of $2,094,414 (Russia)on 527 screens. The film went on to gross about $4.7M in CIS and became the highest grossing Russian film of spring-summer 2011. =Marketing= The film received partial financing and marketing support from some of the major brands that appear in it, without which this story would be impossible to tell. Ginzburg was able to get the freedom to integrate selected brands organically into the story, without the dreaded restrictions, associated with \\"product placement\\". The film's irreverent storytelling demanded unabashed satire and humor, but the historic placement and tremendous PR values compensated the risks. Both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo participated, since both had historical roles to play in epic story of the new Russia. Other brands included Snickers, American Express, Tic-Tac, Smirnoff, Range Rover, Panasonic, Nokia and Apple. Leading Russian search engine Yandex and mobile provider Megafon also played roles and contributed greatly to both the budget and the promotion of the film. Facebook has recently entered the Russian market and contributed a sizable budget to the promotion of the film in order to connect with the progressive audience in Russia. The brand cross-promo marketing value of Generation P was estimated at $2.5M and compensated greatly for marginal advertising by the distributor. Critical reception Generation P received critical acclaim at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival where it played in the Vanguard Program; at 2012 New Directors/New Films at MoMA and Lincoln Center in New York; nominated for New Voices/New Visions Grand Jury Prize at the 2012 Palm Springs International Film Festival. Other accolades include Special Jury Mention at the 2011 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival; Special Jury Prize at the 2012 Sofia International Film Festival; Best Feature Film Debut at the 2012 Almata International Film Festival; and the Audience Award at the 2011 ‚ÄúSputnik Over Poland‚Äù, the biggest festival of Russian cinema outside of Russia. Generation P was the Opening Film of the 2011 London Russian Film Festival and received the \\"Time Out London\\" Critics‚Äô Choice of the Week.

His trial attracted particular media attention because Twitchell had allegedly been inspired by the fictional character Dexter Morgan. The character appears in a series of novels by Jeff Lindsay and the television drama Dexter. Filmmaking ambitions Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Twitchell dreamt of making blockbuster films. Twitchell had directed Star Wars: Secrets of the Rebellion, a 2007 full-length fan film prequel set a few days prior to the original film. Secrets of the Rebellion included a cameo by Jeremy Bulloch, a British actor best known for his role as the Star Wars bounty hunter Boba Fett. The film, still in post-production, never saw release. He had also scripted Day Players, a buddy comedy. In September 2008, he shot a short horror film entitled House of Cards at a garage he rented in the south end of Edmonton. Arrest and trial Twitchell's victim, John Brian \\"Johnny\\" Altinger, was a 38-year-old man who worked as an oilfield equipment manufacturer. On October 10, 2008, Altinger informed his friends of his plans to meet a woman he had been chatting with on the online dating website Plenty of Fish. Following his disappearance, Altinger's friends became concerned after they received emails in which \\"Altinger\\" claimed that his date had taken him off on an extended vacation to Costa Rica. At work, a resignation letter arrived by email, but without a response to a request for a forwarding address for sending a final paycheck. Altinger's friends broke into his condominium only to find his passport, dirty dishes and no indication of his having packed for a trip. A homicide investigation was soon launched by the Edmonton Police Service. Twitchell, interviewed a second time by police, related an improbable account of having met Altinger before his trip to Costa Rica. According to Twitchell, Altinger then sold his car to Twitchell for 40 CAD, all the cash Twitchell had on hand. The police, not believing this story, arrested him on October 31, 2008, and, on the same day, charged with the first-degree murder of Altinger. The key piece of evidence presented by the Crown at Twitchell's first-degree murder trial was a document, entitled \\"SKConfessions\\", which stood for \\"Serial Killer Confessions\\". The document had been recovered from Twitchell's laptop, despite having been deleted. The document begins with the passage: > \\"This story is based on true events. The names and events were altered > slightly to protect the guilty. This is the story of my progression into > becoming a serial killer.\\" It presented an account of its narrator's planning, failed first attempt, and successful second attempt to lure a man to his garage and murder him, with fake online dating profiles used as bait. It went on to describe the process of dismembering the body and attempts to dispose of the remains. During his trial, Twitchell admitted to killing Altinger and authoring the document, but said he had acted in self-defense. He described the document as fiction based on fact, as if he had planned Altinger's death deliberately, in order to craft a compelling story. Another document found on Twitchell's laptop did not make its way into the evidence file for the jury to read during his trial. Entitled \\"A Profile of a Psychopath\\", and believed by investigators to have been written by Twitchell, it is a detailed self-analysis of personality and behaviour. It was released after the trial ended as it was deemed too inflammatory and would compromise the trial. Attempted murder charge Twitchell was convicted of first-degree murder for the death of Altinger. He still faced an attempted murder charge for his alleged attack on Gilles Tetreault. Tetreault testified that he was lured using the website PlentyofFish expecting a date with a woman, only to be attacked by a man in a mask with a stun baton when he arrived at a garage rented by Twitchell. Tetreault escaped with his life. Crown prosecutors had not immediately decided if they would pursue the charge of attempted murder upon securing a conviction of first-degree murder as a conviction of attempted murder would not add to the life sentence Twitchell had already received. On June 17, 2011, an attempted murder charge against Twitchell was stayed in the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, meaning that Crown prosecutors could resurrect the charge within a one-year period. The attempted murder charge against Twitchell was dropped. Detectives were adamant they had gathered a mountain of evidence ‚Äì much of it revealed during the murder trial ‚Äì while even Twitchell himself admitted on the witness stand to committing the attack. In preparing the case for trial, the Crown had argued in court for both the attempted murder and first-degree murder charges to be heard simultaneously as they were part of the same \\"transaction\\" of his attempt to become a serial killer. Under Canadian law, charges can only be heard together if they are linked in some way. Court of Queen's Bench Justice Terry Clackson was not convinced by the prosecution's argument that the attack on the first victim, Gilles Tetreault, and the murder of Johnny Altinger were part of the same transaction. He ordered the charges to be severed and heard separately. \\"The offences are related and connected, but remain discrete,\\" Justice Clackson wrote in his reasons for the decision. \\"As a result, the attempted murder charge cannot stand on the same indictment as the charge of murder because they are different transactions.\\" A conviction of first-degree murder in April 2011 secured a maximum sentence ‚Äî life in prison with no parole eligibility for 25 years ‚Äî and, therefore, eliminated any need to proceed with more charges. Media controversy Extensive media coverage of the case created debate both inside and outside of the courtroom. Observers argued for and against the media's reporting on the more sensational details of the crime. Prior to the criminal trial, Crown prosecutors and the defense sought vast publication bans and sealing orders over the police evidence, preventing the media from reporting on the details of the case until the jury would hear it during the future trial. The media fought the application, but the judge agreed to both a sealing order and publication ban, stating in his ruling that \\"there is a real risk that pretrial publicity will undermine the accused's constitutionally protected right to a fair trial.\\" The jury pool was then polled through a \\"challenge for cause\\" procedure to determine if a potential juror had been influenced by the media coverage prior to the publication bans taking effect. When the bans were lifted, a large media presence attended and reported on the trial, including American television programs Dateline NBC and 48 Hours. Following his first-degree murder conviction, Twitchell used the extensive media coverage of his case as grounds for an appeal. He argued in his notice of appeal that \\"the media attention surrounding my case was so extensive, so blatant and so overtly sensationalized that it is unreasonable to expect any unsequestered jury to have remained uninfluenced by it, regardless of judges' instructions in the charge.\\" However, he then abandoned his appeal in 2012. Post-trial media coverage In December 2012, Michael C. Hall, the actor who plays Dexter Morgan on the Dexter television series, was interviewed by Jian Ghomeshi on the Canadian radio show Q. Hall stated that he did not think Dexter supported the lifestyle of serial killers. \\"I would hope that people's appreciation was more than some sort of fetishization with the kill scenes,\\" he said. Ghomeshi brought up Twitchell and Hall said, \\"I wouldn't stop making Dexter because someone was fascinated by it only in that way. I try to tell myself that their fixated nature would have done it one way or the other, but it seems that Dexter had something to do with it. It's horrifying.\\" In May 2013, it was reported that Twitchell had purchased a television for his prison cell. Twitchell stated that he had caught up on every Dexter episode that he missed since he was arrested and convicted of first-degree murder. Twitchell's case was featured on the American newsmagazine Crime Watch Daily on May 1, 2017. Much of that day's program focused on Twitchell's methods and featured interviews with Gilles Tetrault, his first intended victim, and Steve Lillebuen, author of the book The Devil's Cinema, which focused on the case. Part of the report included a return trip by Tetrault to the garage in which the incident had taken place.

The hospital also offers drug and alcohol rehabilitation inpatient services, and is the base for a number of community mental health teams. Opened as a prison in 1779, many of its buildings and the co-located Glenside campus of the University of the West of England (UWE) are Grade II listed. From 1948 until 2005, the site was also a geriatric hospital, for many of those years being the major geriatric hospital in South West England. In 2009, of the site, incorporating the oldest buildings, was sold to the UK Government's Homes and Communities Agency, and is proposed to be redeveloped as part of a wider regeneration project. History =Stapleton Prison= Stapleton Prison in 1814 The site first came into use as a prison in 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, when it was developed to house Dutch and Spanish prisoners of war who had been landed at Bristol Docks. After George III recognised the 13 United States of America as free and independent in 1783, the prisoners were sent home. The site formally adopted the title 'Stapleton Prison', but was under utilised in civilian use, and was again expanded from 1793 after the commencement of the Napoleonic Wars. A third prison building was completed in 1804, used most recently as nurses' accommodation. After the Treaty of Paris of 1814, the prisoners were again repatriated. Writing in London Labour and the London Poor, published in 1862, Henry Mayhew recounted a letter sent by the secretary of the Bristol Society for the Suppression of Vice in 1808: 'Sir, I took my horse and rode to Stapleton prison ... Inclosed are some of the drawings which I purchased in what they call their market ... They wished to intrude on me a variety of devices in bone and wood of the most obscene kind ... I purchased a few, but they are too bulky for a letter. This market is held before the door of the turnkey every day between the hours of ten and twelve.‚Äô =Stapleton Workhouse= Used as a naval stores, and then a school for naval boys, after a cholera outbreak in 1834 led to overcrowding of Bristol's first workhouse at St Peter's Hospital, the Bristol Corporation of the Poor rented the old prison. After purchasing the site in 1837, they began to make alterations, adding to the walls separating the different sections of the site. In 1861, they demolished many of the oldest prison buildings, and built the main structure of what later become Blackberry Hill Hospital. On the 1880 Ordnance Survey map it is shown as the Bristol Union Workhouse. =Stapleton Institution= At the start of the First World War, the site was turned over to become Stapleton Institution for the Maintenance and Workshop Training of Certified Mental Defectives. The facility housed and then trained those assessed as mentally defective in domestic and industrial crafts, so that they could be deployed in the war effort. After the end of hostilities, these housing and post-assessment training activities continued. =Stapleton Hospital= After the Second World War, the National Health Service Act 1946 turned the informal retention activity into a full mental health facility, under the title Stapleton Hospital. Records show that on take over by the NHS, the facility was caring for 837 patients: 350 under the Mental Treatment Act 1930; 152 mentally handicapped; 80 social misfits. Even after takeover, the previous regime stayed in place, with patients assessed as capable enough working for their keep in the hospital's kitchens, bakery and for local farms. However, in 1948 it became Stapleton Hospital for Geriatric Illness. =Manor Park Hospital= Renamed under the NHS reforms of 1956, Manor Park Hospital retained its geriatric illness brief. The hospital was staffed by eight consultancy teams, and much of its workhouse related architecture was removed, reducing ward sizes, and replacing farming and work areas with gardens. In the 1960s Manor Park Hospital was the major geriatric hospital in South West England. Patient turnover rose despite bed numbers gradually declining from about 650, to about 430 in 1977, due to length of stays decreasing. =Blackberry Hill Hospital= From January 1993, the hospital site merged with the adjacent Glenside Hospital, originally built as a lunatic asylum, to become the jointly named Blackberry Hill Hospital. Patients of Glenside were assessed for capability, with many placed within the Care in the Community programme, while the residual were moved into new buildings constructed on the former Manor Park site for their long term care. Geriatric services Geriatric services were initially run by the Frenchay Healthcare Trust, which took in patients from a wide area. In 1997, the newly created North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT), merging the operations of Frenchay Hospital and Southmead Hospital, took over the running of these services and focused on patients from the trust catchment area. In June 2005, NBT closed inpatient services at Blackberry Hill Hospital, transferring most services to Frenchay Hospital and Southmead Hospital, with the objective of improving services while reducing costs. Stroke services, orthopedic rehabilitation services, dementia services and intermediate care services were moved from Blackberry Hill Hospital. A small respite care service was transferred to Thornbury Hospital. Associated with the move, an inpatient service for elderly mental health patients run by Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership Trust (AWP) at Blackberry Hill was enlarged in size. Some geriatric outpatient services remained at the site, including the Memory Service. However, in 2006 AWP took over the running of the Memory Service, following the national model of Mental Health Trusts running this service. A charity for research into Alzheimer's disease, BRACE, and the Regional Quality Control Laboratories continued to use the site under a lease from NBT until July 2010. Psychiatric services In 2005, AWP created, two new secured facilities at Blackberry Hill. The first was a refurbishment of the secure in-patient care facility to create the Wickham Unit (or Wickham Low Secure Service). The second in new buildings to the rear of the site provided a medium secure facility, known as Fromeside (or Fromeside Medium Secure Unit). In 1996, the Avon and Gloucestershire College of Health (along with the Bath and Swindon College of Health Studies) became part of the University of the West of England (UWE), and the Glenside site became the UWE Faculty of Health and Social Care. In 2013, AWP was given a formal warning by the Care Quality Commission over low staffing levels at its medium-secure unit on the site. =Redevelopment= In 2005, North Bristol NHS Trust transferred most of their remaining services to Frenchay and Southmead Hospitals. In 2007, they declared the Blackberry Hill site surplus to requirements, while AWP moved some of its older people services to Callington Road and Southmead hospitals. After transferring their 10% interest in the site to NBT, AWP adult mental health services were moved to the most modern buildings at the rear of the hospital site. In 2009, the residual Blackberry Hill site was sold to the UK Government's Homes and Communities Agency to be redeveloped as part of a wider regeneration project. The buildings which are mainly Grade II listed will be converted into a mixed-use development of flats, houses, shops and small business premises. In 2017, it was announced that 346 houses would be built on the site.

The locals stated that they were ancient vineyard towers.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, p. 171 Azzun was a site of battle - part of Napoleon Bonaparte's campaign in Ottoman Syria. An Arab poet, Ibrahim Touqan was quoted as saying, \\"by means of Azzun, how soaked [in] the blood [of] Franks [in the] mother valley.\\"Azzun Past and Present Abdul Aziz Arar. When the French army marched into Palestine under the command of Napoleon in February 1799, it faced powerful and unexpected resistance from the inhabitants of Jabal Nablus under the command of their local leaders. They attacked the French army while it was marching towards Acre, especially near the valley of Azzun, taking part in the battle of Tal-Tabur. The participation of the inhabitants and local leaders of Nablus in the struggle against Napoleon reflected a territorial sense in resistance to a foreign army. Ihsan al-Nimr wrote that ‚Äúthe truth is that [Bonaparte‚Äôs] morale was weakened around Jabal Nablus, in the valley of Azzun, Qaqun, and al-Marj ... he headed for Acre with disappointment and without determination‚Äù.al-Nimr, 1961, pp. 223-224 Sheikh Yussuf Jarrar wrote a poem asking the inhabitants, especially the prominent families of Jabal Nablus, to march towards Acre in order to fight the French.al-Nimr, 1961, pp. 210-211 In Doumani‚Äôs words, the poet exposes ‚Äúthe cohesiveness of this reign‚Äôs social formation and the shared sense of identity among its inhabitants versus the factionalism of multiple territorially based centers of power... The most striking aspect of this poem is what it does not say.

Whale watching tours and ferries to Fraser Island depart from here. The Great Sandy Region Botanic Gardens is located in Urangan on a 26 hectare site. It houses a collection of about 20,000 orchids.  History  The Hervey Bay railway line from Maryborough passed through the suburb, terminating at the Urangan Pier. The line reached Pialba on 18 December 1896. However, construction of the extension to Urangan did not commence immediately as the original plan had been for the Vernon Coal and Railway Company to construct that section of the line to transport Burrum coal to the pier. However, the company did not build the line. On 20 December 1911, the Queensland Government decided to build the extension to Urangan, which was officially opened on 19 December 1913 by the Minister for Railways Walter Paget.

The building on the right is part of the 1920s 'New Frankfurt' scheme. After World War I, a new planned satellite town was constructed at R”ßmerstadt, outside Frankfurt in Germany, with the intention to improve housing and living conditions. The lead architect was Ernst May and the design philosophy bore similarities with the English Garden city movement. The scheme was only partially successful, in that running costs of the new electrified dwellings became too expensive in the difficult economic conditions of the later 1920s. History and philosophy behind the design Due to the destruction of World War I, Frankfurt, like most other German cities, suffered a serious housing shortage. In addition, dislike of much late nineteenth-century urban development prevailed in Europe in the 1920s. This included Germany, where the cities were dominated by the large tenement houses known as \\"Mietskasernen\\" (rental barracks). As a result, during the postwar revolutionary years of 1918‚Äì19, calls to abolish the metropolis emerged. This was accompanied by aspirations of a new start, inspired by the prospects of a new democratic society in Germany (Gerd, p. 18, 1986). With this, a more pragmatic approach to planning began during the Weimar Republic (Sohn, 2003, p. 119). This is especially evident in the planning of R√∂merstadt ‚Äì a satellite town built in the mid-1920s. The philosophy of Stadtlandschaft (city-landscape) was an important theme in German urban planning during this period. The term implies low-density urban environment in which the built environment merges with the natural surroundings in a discontinuous, clustered and ordered manner. It is also structured around transportation networks (Mantziaras, 2003, p. 147). This concept was perhaps influenced by and is therefore similar in many ways to the Garden City concept and philosophy. The architect and planner Ernst May In 1925 Frankfurt's mayor, Ludwig Landmann, selected the architect Ernst May from Breslau in Silesia to take control of all building and construction departments in the city. Although May did not solve the housing crisis he inherited, he did commence an unprecedented program of innovative planning, research, and construction that attracted the attention of and participation by many of Europe's leading architects and planners.\\"Frankfurt, Germany\\", Architectural World, May 2008. May was a socialist and saw that planning could be used to create a more equitable society. However, his approach to planning was not very democratic. Unlike North American planners, German planners were not expected to consider the preferences and desires of the community (Mullin, 1977, p-5-6). In line with the Garden City movement, May's program required the greater part of the population to live in a series of new decentralized satellite cities, clustered around Frankfurt, to which they would be connected with high-speed roads and public transit. In all, 14 new settlements were built, housing about 60,000 people. One of the better-known of the satellite towns was R”ßmerstadt. May conceived the satellite settlements as being daughter towns; each settlement was to be tied to Frankfurt by roads, infrastructure, and transit lines. However, the mother centre (Frankfurt) would provide very few of the requirements for daily living. Planners were given the role of building the entire communities‚Äô infrastructure including schools, churches, community centres, shops, playing fields, gardens, work places and of course, housing. In the theme of the Garden City movement, a green-belt link was to be created between the new settlements to foster a new sense of community (Mullin, 1977, p. 8). May was an apprentice of Raymond Unwin in England, a Garden City advocator who promoted new housing estates that would provide high-density low-rise housing for middle-income workers both in large blocks and in long row houses. Mullin (1977) states that May insisted that housing be constructed as inexpensively as possible. To achieve this he advocated using standardized designs, which would be mass-produced. The need to supply cheap housing was imperative during the 1920s as Germany was under significant economic hardship due to the war (p. 8). R”ßmerstadt R”ßmerstadt was built on the site of one of the largest Roman towns on the north side of the Rhine. Prior to its development the area was used for small gardens. The street layout was designed to separate neighbourhood and through streets, it was designed for utility and to provide a sense of form to the area. The local streets were established in a gentle curvilinear pattern with minimal width (Mullin, 1977, p. 12). R”ßmerstadt may be seen as an exemplary settlement in its attempt to fuse modern living with nature: Its ample amenities, low density, cohesive design of households, complete with electricity, cable radio and modern kitchens, offered the most luxurious array of fixtures to families of moderate means in all of Germany. Unfortunately, R”ßmerstadt could also be considered ahead of its time because by 1928, due to price rises in electricity, tenants could not afford to live in such accommodation. They had no coal stoves to fall back on, so residents soon requested the construction of gas lines as an alternative. In 1929, research found that of 448 R”ßmerstadt families, only half were happy with electricity; 35% responded that the kitchen's utilities were too expensive, forcing them to live in dark rooms with no heating or cooking facilities; Most reported technical problems of one sort or another, most notably the hot-water tank in many homes which froze for seven weeks or more during the unusually harsh winter of 1928/1929. It is interesting that Palmowski reports that the majority of municipality spending was aimed at the middle-class electorate, and that municipal socialism was really politics for the middle class and not so much for the working-class (p. 560). Final assessment R”ßmerstadt failed to achieve its socialist, utopian goals mainly due to the hyperinflation of the 1920s, which led to prohibitive power prices. It could also be argued that it failed to truly consider the working class. Despite this, R”ßmerstadt has been described as \\"the most complete realization of the ['New Frankfurt'] programme‚Äôs ideal\\".

It was rediscovered in 1992 in a dune area, near a medieval dyke. Archeological research showed that it had been occupied, in two phases, between 1200 and 1600. Walraversijde has been studied more thoroughly and more systematically than any other medieval fishing community in Europe. The village has been partially reconstructed, and has a museum, Walraversijde Museum, dedicated to the site.  Discovery  Walraversijde was discovered in 1992 on the Belgian coast by the archeologist Marnix Pieters. It was found in a dune area near a medieval dyke. Prior to discovery, Walraversijde was a lost village, with no obvious remains above ground. Two related sites were excavated, one on a beach and the other on a polder. The beach site was inhabited between 1200 and 1400, and the polder site was inhabited between 1400 and 1600. The excavations also found evidence of activities during the Roman era, such as a Roman dyke. Walraversijde ceased having a role after the Siege of Ostend of 1601‚Äì1604, when a Spanish cavalry camp operated from the site. The artefacts and remains are well preserved, and there have been many finds. The sites have been excavated systematically and thoroughly, and have produced unusually rich findings.Durnez J (2006) \\"The provenial museum of Walraversijde, from archaeological research to a cultural tourism project\\" In: Colloquium: To sea or not to sea, VLIZ Special Publication 32, Pages 116‚Äì121. Early village The village of the earlier beach phase of Walraversijde was located behind a protective dune belt. The houses were arranged in small, loose groups, the largest house measuring . Written sources indicate the villagers fished, traded salted fish and other goods, and sometimes engaged in piracy. They probably also dug peat to produce salt. However, the dune belt was maintained badly and Walraversijde became vulnerable. In 1394, a flood drowned the town of Ostend and caused heavy sand drifts and floods around the village. Walraversijde ended up in front of the dunes, and had to be rebuilt further inland.Tys D and Pieters M (2009) \\"Understanding a medieval fishing settlement along the southern Northern Sea: Walraversijde, c. 1200‚Äì1630\\" In: Sicking L and Abreu-Ferreira D (Eds.) Beyond the catch: fisheries of the North Atlantic, the North Sea and the Baltic, 900‚Äì1850, Brill, pages 91‚Äì122. . Later village Well at the reconstructed archeological site of Walraversijde ; ca. 1465 Reconstructed bakery and fish smokehouse; ca. 1465 The new Walraversijde was relocated on a polder protected by a new dyke. At least 100 houses were built, with widths between and lengths between . They were built mainly using brick, often plastered inside and outside. Some houses had stained windows. Floors were brick or sand-covered clay, and roofs were thatched with reeds, straw or galingale. There were also community spaces, such as a draeyplaetsen for making cordage, a brewery and a caetsspel (gaming house and brothel). Around 1435 a chapel was built. As might be expected for a settlement preoccupied with the sea, the occupation density was much higher than in non-fishing rural communities. No spaces were set aside for stables, gardens or fields between houses. Between 1383 and 1413, under the supervision of the admirals of the Count of Flanders and the Duke of Burgundy, privateering and piracy took place between English and Flemish fishing and trading vessels. The fisherman of Walraversijde participated in this privateering to the degree that they were warned not to plunder or damage ships at sea unless ordered to do so by the duke. In addition to acting as privateers under the orders of the duke, Walraversijde fisherman supplied the duke's fleet with vessels and the fishing fleet with guard boats throughout the fifteenth century. The villagers had commodities one might not expect to find in a medieval fishing community. There were \\"exotic spices such as paradise grains, cloves and pepper, exotic fruit such as pomegranates, ivory combs, cast bronze candlesticks and luxury ceramics.\\" The piracy, privateering and also beachcombing must have played a part in this, as probably also did the piloting of Spanish merchant vessels by Walraversijde fisherman to the port of Bruges. By the middle of the fifteenth century, Walraversijde reached its heyday, becoming, both economically and politically, the most important village in the region. It was well populated, housing perhaps 500 to 600 people, though half the population were usually away at sea. The village operated about twenty fishing vessels, each crewed with between thirteen and twenty fishermen. The fishermen were individually free and independent, brought their own nets, and shared in the profits. The sciplieden (boat captains) owned the fishing vessels, and were the central figures in the village at the top of the social hierarchy. Later in the fifteenth century, larger vessels were developed which could sail to the lucrative offshore fishing grounds of the Doggerbank. Purchasing these vessels required money which the fishermen did not have. Rich fish merchants invested in the fleet, and the new ship owners or wards took control of the offshore fishing. The role of the captains diminished and the independent fishermen were reduced to wage fishermen.

Starting in 1483, Maximilian of Austria warred against a coalition of Bruges and Ghent for ten years. Walraversijde was in the middle of these battles and was probably deserted during this time. The houses in the eastern quarter of the village were ruined and subsequently abandoned. To make matters worse, the fishing fleet became endangered at sea. Different parties in the English Channel and the North Sea became threatening in various ways, and the fisherman had to arrange for armed ships to protect their fleet. Meanwhile, the sand dunes started drifting again, and the village brewery closed. But this was just a start. In 1568 the Eighty Years' War began, the Sea Beggars blockaded coastal ports while mercenaries plundered and looted the coast itself. In 1571 the dikes that surrounded Ostend were breached in a desperate attempt to defend the town. For eleven further years the region, including Walraversijde, was flooded and uninhabitable. Beyond this, the war still carried on, further destroying the area. By 1598, written sources recount how wasted the area had become, including Walraversijde. The finishing touch was the Siege of Ostend (1601‚Äì1604), after which, apart from some isolated houses, the fishing community of Walraversijde ceased to exist. The tower of the chapel remained until the nineteenth century, when it collapsed in a storm. Walraversijde Museum Barrels for salted herring Because of the archaeological richness of the findings, the Province of West Flanders decided to present the results in an on-site interactive museum, Walraversijde Museum. The museum opened in 2000, and includes three medieval houses and a bakery/smokehouse. These late medieval buildings have been reconstructed as they are thought to have appeared during the prime of Walraversijde around 1465, together with furniture, fittings and fixtures. Flemish artists were particularly productive during the 15th century, and their paintings have been helpful guides during reconstruction. The museum displays artifacts which give a sense of the medieval fishing industry and trade, as well as the risks the fishermen faced at sea, such as piracy, war and shipwrecks. There are further displays concerning household goods, clothing, hygiene, religious and recreational life, mouth bows and staffs, toys for young and old, including a well- engineered pair of bone glasses. Walraversijde has been studied more thoroughly and systematically than any other medieval fishermen community in Europe. This is, in part, because most other locations are still inhabited.

A highly skilled burglar, at five feet-four inches and 150 pounds, Nordahl targeted the homes of wealthy individuals across the East Coast and showed an exclusive interest in stealing hallmarked antique silver. Despite his skill, he was arrested at least eight times and spent many years in prison. The exact sum of his thefts is uncertain, but a November 2000 U.S. News & World Report article attributed to him 150 burglaries across 10 states, to a value of $3 million. Biography =Early life= Nordahl was born April 19, 1962, the son of artist David Nordahl and his wife Sharon, and grew up in Albert Lea, Minnesota. He attended high school in Wisconsin, but dropped out and started work in the construction industry. The family later moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he completed his GED before joining the United States Navy, where he served for several years. =Criminal beginnings= Nordahl began his criminal career while posted at a naval weapons station in Monmouth County, New Jersey, in 1983. He was soon arrested and served a short jail sentence. In these early years, he also spent time in prison for burglaries in Burlington County; on both occasions he was released early on parole for good behavior. In 1991, he was again arrested and charged with prowling and possessing instruments connected to burglaries, although there was not enough evidence to charge him with the break-ins themselves. For this charge, he spent a few months in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, prison. Soon after his release, Nordahl was back in prison again, having confessed to 40 burglaries. ='Burglar to the Stars'= When released, Nordahl continued his criminal activities and in 1996 Connecticut police issued an arrest warrant, accusing him of burglaries to the value of $750,000. This included the theft of 120 pairs of silver salt and pepper shakers from the home of Ivana Trump in Greenwich, which were valued at approximately $50,000. A report on this burglary alerted the North Shore police to the fact that Nordahl might also be responsible for a series of 11 burglaries on wealthy individuals in Chicago. The FBI were now involved in the case and traced him using car rental receipts, which had been paid for using Nordahl's credit card. He was eventually arrested outside of a Walmart store in Sparta, Wisconsin on October 15 and held on bail pending extradition. At this point, several police forces became interested in Nordahl, believing that he may have been responsible for unsolved burglaries in their area. In 1997, as part of a deal with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to transport stolen goods across state lines. He was held in prison to await sentencing, but released in July 1998 when the sentence hearing was postponed. By this time, the media had given him the nickname 'Burglar to the Stars'. In 2000, he was sentenced to five years in prison for the conspiracy to which he had pleaded guilty in 1997, and also ordered to pay $1 million in restitution. As part of the deal he had made with the prosecutors, he avoided charges for about 50 burglaries across five states. =Further arrests= Soon after being released on parole in April 2001, Nordahl went on the run, having committed more burglaries in Philadelphia. Using aliases, he avoided arrest until March 2002, when he was apprehended by US Marshals in Maple Shade Township, New Jersey. No new burglary charges were brought against him, but he was sentenced to two years in prison for probation violations. He was discharged in November 2003, but was held in custody awaiting extradition to New York State to face charges of burglary and grand larceny made by the Dutchess County District Attorney's Office. Nordahl, however, became a fugitive again and avoided his extradition hearing. During this time, a series of skillful mansion break-ins occurred along the East Coast, in which high values of silver were taken. These initially puzzled their investigators, as Detective Jack McGiness of the Philadelphia serious crime unit later explained: > Suddenly there were all these burglaries that had Nordahl's modus operandi > all over them. We thought that he was locked up, but then discovered that he > was not. He was arrested again in Philadelphia in January 2004, after US Marshals again tracked him, this time to the home of his ex-girlfriend's sister. Although he violently resisted arrest, he was eventually apprehended and charged with assaulting police officers and skipping bail. In December 2004, he was sentenced to eight years in prison. Released on parole in 2010, he was again arrested in Hilliard, Florida on August 26, 2013, by the Nassau County Sheriff's Office. Motive and modus operandi Nordahl gained a reputation for his skilful and audacious burglaries, with comparisons being drawn with John Robie, the cat burglar portrayed by Cary Grant in the Alfred Hitchcock film To Catch a Thief. He often targeted houses while the occupants were still inside sleeping, claiming that he burgled for the excitement not just for the money. He enjoyed the notoriety he achieved, with one officer commenting that he had an 'ego as big as a house.' When interviewed in 2000, he stated: > It‚Äôs like a natural high. It fills a void. A lot of times life can be very > mundane, very tedious. You want something different. Nordahl's burglaries generally followed a very particular pattern. He specifically targeted the homes of rich families, which he would research in a local library. His usual method of entry was to cut through or remove panes of glass from a home's French doors or windows and crawl through the opening, thus avoiding alarms that would be set off if the door or window was opened. This was meticulous work that could take over an hour. If necessary, he would then disable the home's alarm system, using knowledge he had gained from careful study. Once inside a home, Nordahl was very particular about the items he stole. Only interested in genuine silver, he would take drawers of items outside and test them using a silver test kit he took with him; plate silver items would be left behind. When arrested in 1996, police found a copy of an up-to-date antiques and collectibles price guide among his possessions, as well as a directory of wealthy Americans. His careful approach was refined over many years, as he learned from his mistakes. He began to throw away his clothes and shoes after each burglary after police used a shoe print to attribute a New Jersey burglary to Nordahl. He also took increasing care about cleaning up behind himself to avoid leaving footprints or similar marks. Despite the seriousness of the crimes, police officers had a certain admiration for his professionalism. Wellesley Police Lieutenant Wayne Cunningham described him as a 'master of his craft.' Captain McGiness stated: > This guy is the true professional. He always wears special gloves with > little grip dimples on them and can take a pane of glass from your patio > door, walk through your house, steal your valuables and leave, and you won't > know a thing. Monmouth County detective Lonnie Mason commented: > I'll tell you, I have a lot of respect for his ability as a burglar. He made > a business out of it.

Derived from the Greek opsismos (\\"late\\"), the name \\"opsismodysplasia\\" describes a delay in bone maturation. In addition to this delay, the disorder is characterized by micromelia (short or undersized bones), particularly of the hands and feet, delay of ossification (bone cell formation), platyspondyly (flattened vertebrae), irregular metaphyses, an array of facial aberrations and respiratory distress related to chronic infection. Opsismodysplasia is congenital, being apparent at birth. It has a variable mortality, with some affected individuals living to adulthood. The disorder is rare, with an incidence of less than 1 per 1,000,000 worldwide. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means the defective (mutated) gene that causes the disorder is located on an autosome, and the disorder occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited. No specific gene has been found to be associated with the disorder. It is similar to spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Sedaghatian type.  Presentation  Typical ossification center formation in a developing long bone of a fetal cat. Opsismodysplasia can be characterized by a delay in bone maturation, which refers to \\"bone aging\\", an expected sequence of developmental changes in the skeleton corresponding to the chronological age of a person. Factors such as gender and ethnicity also play a role in bone age assessment. The only indicator of physical development that can be applied from birth through mature adulthood is bone age. Specifically, the age and maturity of bone can be determined by its state of ossification, the age-related process whereby certain cartilaginous and soft tissue structures are transformed into bone. The condition of epiphyseal plates (growth plates) at the ends of the long bones (which includes those of the arms, hands, legs and feet) is another measurement of bone age. The evaluation of both ossification and the state of growth plates in children is often reached through radiography (X-rays) of the carpals (bones of the hand and wrist). In opsismodysplasia, the process of ossification in long bones can be disrupted by a failure of ossification centers (a center of organization in long bones, where cartilage cells designated to await and undergo ossification gather and align in rows) to form. This was observed in a 16-month-old boy with the disorder, who had no apparent ossification centers in the carpals (bones of the hand and wrist) or tarsals (bones of the foot). This was associated with an absence of ossification in these bones, as well as disfigurement of the hands and feet at age two. The boy also had no ossification occurring in the lower femur (thigh bone) and upper tibia (the shin bone).  Genetics  Opsismodysplasia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Opsismodysplasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene(s) responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Currently, no specific mutation in any gene has been found to cause the disorder. It appears that the gene inositol polyphosphate phosphatase-like 1 is the cause of this condition in at least some cases.Chai EC, Singaraja RR (2013) Opsismodysplasia: Implications of mutations in the developmental gene INPPL1. Clin Genet doi: 10.1111/cge.12136 Diagnosis Epidemiology Opsismodysplasia is a very rare disorder, and is estimated to occur in less than 1 in 1,000,000 people.  History  The disorder was first described by Jonathan Zonana and associates in 1977. Further observation of four cases of it was reported by Pierre Maroteaux and colleagues in 1982, and Maroteaux was the first to call the disorder \\"opsismodysplasia\\", in a 1984 journal report of three affected individuals. The name derives from the Greek opsismos, meaning \\"late\\", while the term dysplasia refers to development.

This illustration was drawn by Frederic Villiers and published in 1874. Drury Lane pantomime is a long tradition at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, dating from the early 18th century. In every Christmas season, a pantomime is produced which has a leading place among the many other pantomimes of the capital. Other pantomimes are sometimes produced during the rest of the year. Pantomime Theatre is a family-friendly genre of stage performance that includes cross dressing actors performing songs, dances, skits, and slapstick comedy. History The origins of pantomime at Drury Lane can be traced back to sixteenth century commedia dell'arte‚Äôs stock character Arlecchino. Three Hundred years before the birth of Pantomime, this tricky servant was best known for his lighthearted nimbleness, zany personality, crude expression of sexuality, and physical agility. John Weaver, known as the Father of Modern Pantomime, premiered a version of Arlecchino‚Äôs act at Drury Lane Theatre in 1702. The first English pantomime was Tavern Bilkers performed at Drury Lane in 1702. This started a popular tradition in which the annual Christmas pantomime at Drury Lane was the foremost entertainment of this kind. The thirty seven pantomimes in the years 1852 to 1888 were all written by E.L. Blanchard. From 1893 to 1923, most of the music for the Drury Lane pantomimes was arranged by Jimmy Glover (1861‚Äì1931), Director of Music .Peter Gammond, ed., The Oxford Companion to Popular Music (Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 228 References External links * Pantomimes at Drury Lane Pantomime ","title":"Drury Lane pantomime"},{"id":"31513827","text":"Felipe Olivares Rojas (5 February 1910 - date of death unknown) was a Mexican football forward who made one appearance for the Mexico national team at the 1930 FIFA World Cup.

He owned one of the most important contemporary African art collections, which includes more than 3,000 pieces.  Family and education  Born in Kinshasa in 1972, he was brought up in Belgium and France by his parents: Augustin Dokolo, a bank owner, millionaire and collector of African arts, and his Danish wife Hanne Kruse. He attended the Lyc√©e Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague in Paris from which he graduated; later he studied economics, commerce and foreign languages at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris. In 2002, he married Isabel dos Santos, the eldest daughter of Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos, former President of Angola. He and his wife are currently under investigation for obtaining their wealth by corrupt means, allegations they deny.  Promoting African arts  Through his father's initiative, he started an arts collection at the age of 15. During an interview to Angolan TV network TPA, Sindika Dokolo said his parents already very much liked art: his mother took him to visit all the museums in Europe and his father was a great collector of classical African art. In 1995, he decided to return to Zaire to join the large family business ‚Äì in total 17 companies (banking, breeding, fishing, coffee exportation, real estate, consumer goods distributor, merchandise conveyance, printing, insurance, mining and car selling). The country collapsed and their activity couldn't survive. Later, these family businesses were nationalized by the Government of Zaire in 1986 under President Mobutu Sese Seko. Paintings on a public streetmarket in Angola Later he started the Sindika Dokolo Foundation to promote numerous arts and culture festivals at home and abroad. Its mission is to create a display center for contemporary and other African art in Luanda, and also to create the conditions and activities which are necessary to integrate African artists in the international circles of the art world. Dokolo states that his connection to the arts is not intended to be recognized as a great collector, but rather \\"to present African artists to the world\\". The Foundation follows the principle of freely lending its pieces to any international museum as long as that museum presents the same exhibition in an African country. Sindika Dokolo started expositions like the SD Observatorio (July 2006 ‚Äì August 2006) at the Valencia Institute of Modern Art, the Trienal de Luanda (December 2006 ‚Äì March 2007), or the Check List Luanda Pop (June 2007 ‚Äì November 2007) at the 52nd Venice Biennale. When the German collector Hans Bogatzke died, the curator Fernando Alvim suggested to Sindika Dokolo that he buy the 500 piece collection. The collection was secured for a low price because Hans Bogatzke's widow, despite loving her husband, didn't want the responsibility and was pleased knowing it would be shown in Africa. On 25 January 2010, he organized a huge exposition for Luanda's 434th anniversary called Luanda Suave e Fren√©tica, with many artists reflecting in various ways about a \\"vibrant and smooth\\" city. In December 2013, Dokolo attended the opening of the VII Biennial of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, international art exhibition in the country, where the art works of Sindika Dokolo Foundation are exposed. In an interview with Portuguese newspaper Jornal de Neg√≥cios, the art collector talked about his collection, arguing that \\"the added value of contemporary African art scene is to give a sensible and intelligent perspective of a continent that is constantly on the move,\\" aspects that will, in his opinion, project the African continent in the future. Sindika Dokolo took part in the October 2014 1:54 contemporary African art, held in London with the participation of many well-known personalities, including Lupita Nyong'o. At this event, a number of artists and celebrities, as the model Alek Wek or singer Keziah Jones, publicly expressed their support and appreciation for the work of the collector, highlighting the role that Sindika Dokolo Foundation has played in the development of contemporary African art. On the sidelines of this participation, Sindika Dokolo told New African about his projects for Angola and how \\"contemporary African art should be accessible to African and impact their lives.\\" In March 2015, Sindika Dokolo was awarded with Medal of Merit by the city of Oporto, with regard to the contemporary art exhibition You Love Me, You Love Me Not. This honor is the city recognition of the contribution of Sindika Dokolo, which allowed the city of Oporto to develop one of the most relevant projects within the contemporary art of today, helping to establish a \\"natural bridge\\" between the city and the world. The exhibition features works from the art collector's collection and brings together fifty artists (not all Africans). This is the most important exhibition of the collection of Sindika Dokolo Foundation ever achieved and it is considered the largest existing African art collection. In January 2016, the Sindika Dokolo Foundation strengthened its ties with Portugal by choosing Oporto to house its European headquarters. Located on Casa Manoel de Oliveira building, the new headquarters will become a place to \\"promote artistic thinking networks and strengthen ties between Portugal and Angola, as well as Europe and Africa, celebrating art as an unifying element for people and nations,\\" said Dokolo. Sindika Dokolo has launched a worldwide campaign to force Western museums, art dealers and auction houses to return Africa's art. \\"Works that used to be clearly in African museums must absolutely return to Africa,\\" said Dokolo. In addition to collecting works of art, the collector is dedicated to \\"recovering the stolen pieces during the colonial era\\", a mission accomplished with the help of an international team. In an interview with Jeune Afrique magazine, Sindika Dokolo revealed that he has the ambition to \\"build the most beautiful collection of classical art in the world\\". The art collector also believes that \\"the great challenge of contemporary African art is to be able to establish the connection and assume the role of depositary of this exceptional phenomenon that was classic [African] art. Not only for what was produced, but also for the place of art in society, and that is how we define artists and works, how we live art.\\"  Business and Corruption  Living in Luanda since 1999, Sindika Dokolo is a businessman and the president of Sindika Dokolo Foundation. He is member of the board of the Angolan cement company Nova Cimangola. Sindika Dokolo is also member of the board of Amorim Energia that owns a third of Portuguese petrol company Galp through the company Esperanza Holding BV. In 2020, leaked documents indicated that Dokolo had made millions from a suspiciously one-sided partnership with the Angolan state diamond company, Sodiam, to buy a stake in Swiss luxury jeweller De Grisogono. The art collector has also invested in various sectors, including diamonds, oil, real estate and telecommunications, in Angola, Portugal, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Mozambique. In an interview with Jeune Afrique, he also stated that his aim is not \\"to build a large integrated group\\", but rather to have the opportunity to see \\"Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo as a complementary complement\\" ‚Äì \\"a Luanda-Kinshasa axis that could create a counterweight to South African supremacy\\".

The Suining City Public Security Bureau released a document on the evening of 21 February, stating that he had been criminally detained for \\"inciting subversion of state power.\\" Officers and security guards later searched his home, confiscating a computer, two hard drives and a USB drive, and then held him at the Suining City Detention Center. Chinese Human Rights Defenders reported on 17 December 2011 that Chen's case had been transferred to the Suining Municipal Intermediate People's Court at the end of November 2011. Authorities reportedly attempted to prevent Chen's wife from hiring lawyer Liang Xiaojun. Liang was ultimately only permitted to see Chen once, while his other lawyer, Zheng Jianwei, saw him only twice before the trial. Chen told his lawyer that he had not broken the law and that he had merely been exercising the right guaranteed to all Chinese citizens under the Chinese Constitution to express their views. Chen's lawyer was told that the trial would be held within one week. On 23 December 2011, the Suining Municipal Intermediate People's Court sentenced Chen to nine years in prison after he was convicted of \\"incitement to subversion\\" over four essays he wrote and published online.

She owned several houses in the Bernese old town as well as the alpine meadowland known as R√§misgummen above Eggiwil. In addition, she inherited Amsoldingen Castle from her father and R√ºmligen Castle from her mother, the latter being her main residence for many years.  Biography  She was born in Bern to Anna von Wattenwyl and Ludwig von Tscharner, a doctor of philosophy and army engineer, in the family's M√ºnsterplatz residence. Her family refused to grant permission for her to marry the man she loved, and she was obliged to marry her cousin in 1905. The marriage ended in divorce in 1923. Her father died in 1927, her son committed suicide in 1939 and her daughter emigrated to Morocco. The tragedy of her son's suicide caused her to dress in mourning for the rest of her life. She devoted herself to philosophy and wrote innumerable letters. She regularly staged equestrian jumping events (concours hippique) and was noted for her imperious manner. Meuron's lifestyle gave rise to innumerable anecdotes which, however, while having substance, should not all be taken at face value. Her reputation was derived not only from her anachronistic appearance‚Äîold fashioned widow's weeds, walking stick, and ear trumpet (\\"So that I hear only what I want to hear\\")‚Äîbut also on account of her eccentric behaviour. She was often seen in downtown Bern accompanied by her Russian greyhounds. Her staff were allowed to park her car anywhere; if police came she would exclaim, \\"That stays here!\\" She never bought a tram ticket, because, as she stated: \\"I was here before the tram!\\" She would ask total strangers, \\"Are you someone or do you get a salary?\\" When a farmer wanted to sit on the Frisching family pew in church, she pulled him off, stating \\"Up in heaven we'll all be equal, but in the meantime, down here, we'll have a bit of discipline.\\" Once, when a female vagrant (crazy little beggar woman, as Meuron put it) was caught stealing fruit from her castle grounds, she locked her up in the coach house for two days. When charged with false imprisonment, she produced in court a document dating from the Middle Ages that authorized the owner of R√ºmligen Castle to administer low justice. She was let off with a small fine and a lecture on current law.  References   Bibliography  * Borle, R. et al. (1980). Madame de Meuron 22. August 1882 ‚Äì 22. Mai 1980. Bern: Erpf. . * Jenny, H. A.

Jennings was a left-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox. He was born in Tiverton, Devon. Jennings made his first-class debut for Surrey in the 1921 County Championship against Essex. Jennings played first-class cricket for Surrey from 1921 to 1924, playing 18 times for them. In these 18 matches, he scored 194 runs at a batting average of 13.85, with a high score of 37*. Predominantly a bowler, Jennings took 37 wickets for Surrey at a bowling average of 29.56, with three five wicket hauls and once taking ten wickets in a match, which came against Derbyshire in 1924. He claimed 6 wickets in the Derbyshire first-innings and took 4 in their second. The pitches at The Oval in the early to mid-twenties were not friendly to Jennings style of bowling, thus he wasn't a regular feature in the Surrey team. Following the end of his first-class career, Jennings played Minor counties cricket for Devon, having previously represented the Surrey Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship. His debut for Devon came against the Surrey Second XI in 1926, with Jennings playing Devon from 1926 to 1933. Starting in 1935, Jennings began umpiring in the Minor Counties Championship, standing in 87 matches between 1935 and 1962. He stood in just the one first-class match, held in 1953 between a combined Minor Counties team and the touring Australians at the Michelin Ground, Stoke-on-Trent. Part of a large cricketing family, his brothers David, George and Leonard all played first-class cricket. Following his move back to Devon from, he became the head groundsman at Blundell's School in his home town. It was here that Jennings died on 7 September 1972.

This self- reported assessment scale consists of 17 items, which cover the main spectrum of social phobia such as fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms. The statements of the SPIN items indicate the particular signs of social phobia. Answering the statements a person should indicate how much each statement applies to him or her. The SPIN questionnaire is similar to a customer service survey. Each statement of SPIN can be measured by a choice of five answers based on a scale of intensity of social phobia singes ranging from \\"Not at all\\" to \\"Extremely\\". Each answer is then assigned a number value ranging from least intense to most intense. Overall assessment is done by total score, and the total score higher than 19 indicates on likelihood of social anxiety disorder.

Aramel.free Their dimensions on average are larger than in Orthetrum coerulescens. The thorax and the abdomen are pale blue in males, yellowish-brown or greyish-brown in females. Young males are brownish. The abdomen is relatively flattened and shows a thin middorsal black line and distinct points on each segment. The wings are hyaline, with yellow or pale brown pterostigma. The wingspan reaches . Biology and behavior Adults can be encountered from mid June through late August in the immediate vicinity of quiet rivers or close to stagnant and shallow waters, lying on a well sunny ground. Sexually mature males defend a 'territory' on the waterfront by making short inspection flights, in order to chase away other males. These skimmers commonly mate at rest, usually on the ground. Female lays the eggs on the surface of shallow water, touching it only with her abdomen while flying, sometimes accompanied by the male, that keeps other males at a distance. The larvae are ferocious predators. They live buried in fine soil material (fine sand, silt, etc.), in unshaded places in shallow water. They overwinter and develop in two or three years.

Metzger-Lattermann continued to perform as a Lieder recitalist, often accompanied by Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner. She gave her last concerts in 1933 under Bruno Walter in Berlin and Otto Klemperer in Dresden, with the seizure of power by Hitler.

In 1933, the American theatre impresario George Blumental (a former associate of Oscar Hammerstein I, who in 1917 had tried to set up theatres for American troops in Paris), tried to arrange with Georg Hartmann and Arthur Hirsch to bring over conductor Blech and a troupe of 12 Jewish opera singers to present Wagner's Ring in New York. Hirsch's assistant, Otto Metzger, was Ottilie's brother and Ottilie was on the list. Blumental's plans came to nothing, partly due to the unavailability of Blech, Klemperer, and Walter.

The proposal for a memorial plaque was proposed to Wolfgang ages ago by a retired singer and Bayreuth antiquarian bookseller, Peer Baedeker. And therein lies a revealing story. When the centenary festival opened in 1976 with a wreath-laying ceremony at Wagner's grave, Baedeker placed his own wreath with a ribbon attached, with the words: 'In memory of Richard Breitenfeld, Henriette Gottlieb, Ottilie Metzger-Lattermann ‚Äì Honoured as festival singers ‚Äì Murdered in Nazi concentration camps.' Within 24 hours of the ceremony, the ribbon had vanished. An article about the incident, which later appeared in an Israeli newspaper, was sent to Winifred, who wrote the following ineffable letter to Baedeker: 'Herr Heinrich Schaar in Munich sends me from time to time cuttings from the Israel Nachrichten, including this one. ... Herr Schaar appears to suspect that this was my doing or at my behest, since otherwise he would not have sent me the press cutting. In the first place I had no idea you had laid a wreath, and in the second I seldom go to RW's resting place; since it is now permanently open to the public, it is never possible to visit the grave alone. I myself never heard Frau Metzger- Lattermann in Bayreuth, but I know that my husband had a very high impression of her. Frau Gottlieb sang here in my time and I had a high opinion of her as well. Herr Breitenfeld is unknown to me. But were all three really killed at Auschwitz? I would doubt that in the case of Frau Lattermann, since she must have been terribly old. With best wishes, also to your wife, whom I recently greeted in front of Wahnfried.' ‚Äì The casualness of this brush-off, the brutal indifference to the murder of three old singers speaks volumes about the attitude in Bayreuth to its past. And so the monument that the festival visitor sees today on the Green Hill ‚Äì the massive copy of the bust of a glowering Wagner made for Hitler by the Nazi sculptor Arno Breker ‚Äì is, properly viewed, a brazen symbol of Bayreuth's.\\" Recordings * Richard Wagner, Siegfried, \\"Stark ruft das Lied\\" (1908), Opera Nederland, profile, photo References External links *Career, photos German opera singers German people who died in Auschwitz concentration camp Musicians from Frankfurt 1943 deaths 1878 births Operatic contraltos German contraltos Jewish opera singers 20th-century German musicians 20th-century women singers German Jews who died in the Holocaust ","title":"Ottilie Metzger-Lattermann"},{"id":"31514275","text":"The Dean of Chester is based at Chester Cathedral in the Diocese of Chester and is the head of the Chapter at the cathedral.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 4 June 2019 She first met Lady Georgiana Fullerton around 1859. Between 1859 and 1866, Frances explored a religious vocation, including time spent with the Daughters of Charity in Paris and the Filles de Marie (Daughters of the Heart of Mary) in England. Around 1865-7, with the support of Dr. Manning and Father James Clare S.J., Rector of the Immaculate Conception Church, Farm Street, Frances visited Ireland to study Catholic charitable institutions, partly to better assist Irish emigrants in England. Her collaboration with Fullerton led to the foundation of a congregation for work among the poor of London. At first an affiliation with the Little Sisters of Mary (Archduchy of Posen) was considered. In 1867 Lady Georgiana translated the rule of the ‚ÄòLittle Servant Sisters of the Immaculate Conception‚Äô, a rural Polish congregation. Permission was granted by the founder, Edmund Bojanowski, to establish the congregation in England. On 24 October 1868, Frances Taylor took charge of a putative English branch of this congregation, in rented rooms in Fleet Street, London. In February 1869, at the invitation of the order of priests, the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the community moved to the Catholic mission at Tower Hill, where they worked until June 1870. On 12 February 1872, the new congregation came formally into being when Taylor took her religious vows and the name Sister Mary Magdalen of the Sacred Heart. Affiliation with the Polish congregation was found to be impracticable, and the new order was placed under the direction of its own superior general, Mother M. Magdalen. From the first it was approved and encouraged by Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, its spiritual training being committed to the Fathers of the Society of Jesus, on Farm St., London.Kelly, Blanche Mary. \\"Poor Servants of the Mother of God.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12.

The members devoted themselves to visiting the poor, teaching in parochial schools, nursing in central London and Soho. The early foundations of the congregation included refuges, night shelters, schools, a workhouse, a home for the elderly, and the Providence Hospital in St Helens, Lancashire. The main other foundations made during Mother Magdalen‚Äôs lifetime were: Limerick, Ireland.

Its Constitutions were written by Father Augustus Dignam SJ, in conjunction with Mother Magdalen. On 18 July 1879 the Brief of Praise or Decretum Laudis was granted, signed by Pope Leo XIII. On 1 May 1892 the Brief of Approbation of the Institute and Constitutions was granted. The definitive approval of the Constitutions was granted by the Holy See on 19 July 1900, a month after Mother Magdalen‚Äôs death. The Generalate is based at Maryfield Convent, Roehampton, London.

Biography Kvochur piloting a Sukhoi Su-30LL demonstrator along the runway at Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport extremely close to the ground. (March 2006) Anatoly Kvochur was born on April 16, 1952, in the village of Mazurovka, Mohyliv-Podilskyi in the Vinnytsia Oblast of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. He studied at the V. M. Komarov Higher Military Flying School at Yeysk, graduating in 1973. He began service as a pilot in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. He served for two years before he was discharged from the Soviet Armed Forces in 1977 with a recommendation for admittance to the Fedotov Test Pilot School. He graduated from the school in 1978. From 1978 to 1981 he worked as a test pilot at Komsomolsk-on-Amur, testing Su-17 aircraft and its modifications. He also studied further at the Moscow Aviation Institute, from whence he graduated in 1981. He was transferred to the Mikoyan Design Bureau where he participated in the testing of more than 80 types of aircraft, including MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-27, MiG-29, MiG-31, as well as air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles. Since then he has appeared in numerous international air shows, showcasing Russian aircraft. In 1995 Kvochur participated in a very long range flight demonstration of Su-27PD and Su-27PU Flankers featuring an inflight refueling probe. He led an aerobatic team, known as the Test Pilots Team (Lyotchiki-Ispyttahteli), which also included the pilots Vladimir Loginovsky and Alexander Garnaev. Paris Air Show incident Kvochur was involved in an airshow accident on 8 June 1989 at the Paris Air Show. He was flying a single-seater Mikoyan MiG-29 Fulcrum 'Blue 303', the latest fighter aircraft of the Soviet Union at the time. While executing a low-speed, high-angle attack portion of his routine, a bird was sucked into the turbofan of his right engine (a bird strike), causing the engine to burst into flames. Kvochur immediately turned the remaining engine to full afterburner. However his speed, at , was too slow to maintain stability on one engine. Despite his efforts, the stricken aircraft went into a steep dive. Kvochur managed to steer the MiG away from the crowd and eject 2.5 seconds before impact. He landed away from the fireball of the crashed plane. The incident was caught on video and is featured on the reality television series World's Most Amazing Videos. The aircraft Kvochur was in had a Zvezda K-36D ejection seat at that time. The same ejection seat also helped save the lives of the pilots of two MiG-29s that collided mid-air at the Royal International Air Tattoo four years later, on 24 July 1993, and the pilot and navigator of a Sukhoi Su-30 that crashed from a tail-strike at the Paris Air Show on 12 June 1999 (which was also captured on video).Stamford, Lincs., UK: Air Forces Monthly, Alan Dawes, \\"That Crash - at Le Bourget\\", August 1999, Number 137, pages 50-53.

Near-contemporary Cicero briefly mentioned it in his philosophical dialogue De Natura Deorum, referencing political scandal in the late Roman Republic with the line \\"Consider other judicial inquiries, the one in reference to the gold of Tolosa, and the one on the Jugurthine conspiracy...\\" Chapter XXX The treasure itself was discussed by several ancient historians, including Strabo and Cassius Dio.  Greek Origins of Gallic Treasure  The course of Volcae tribal migration throughout the 3rd centuries BC, noting the destination of some Tectosages and the Arecomisci to the area around Tolosa In a fragment from Cassius Dio's work, the historian asserted that the Gold of Tolosa had its origins in the Gallic invasion of Greece under Brennus. In 280 BC, a great army of Gallic warriors invaded Macedon and central Greece. According to Pausanias, the Gauls were motivated by a desire for plunder. The success of the expedition was rich enough to prompt Brennus, who been one of the leaders of the 280 BC expedition, to persuade the Gallic tribes to launch another invasion. Brennus convinced the Gauls that the relative Greek weakness at the time and the great wealth of the Greek cities and temple sanctuaries were opportunities to be exploited. Strabo relates that the Volcae Tectosages were believed to have been amongst the tribes that joined Brennus in this invasion. The campaign of 279 BC proved less successful than that of the previous year. While a Greek coalition force of Aetolians, Boeotians, Athenians, Phocians, and other Greeks north of Corinth mustered at the narrow pass of Thermopylae, on the east coast of central Greece, Brennus pushed southward with his warriors. A Greek attempt to delay the Gauls at the Spercheios failed when a Gallic force of ten thousand swam the river and moved to outflank the outnumbered Greeks. At the Battle of Thermopylae, the Greeks initially managed to check the Gallic advance, inflicting heavy losses on Brennus' army. In an attempt to divide the Greek coalition force and thereby weaken it, Brennus detached approximately forty thousand of his warriors from the main army and dispatched them to Aetolia. This detachment sacked Callia and proceeded to brutally pillage the Aetolian towns and temples. Alarmed at the news, the Aetolian detachment left Thermopylae in order to defend their homeland. The news from Aetolia undermined Greek morale and prompted the defection of the Heracleots and the Aenianians from the Greek coalition. Eager for the Gauls to leave their territories, the Heracleots and the Aenianians showed Brennus how to bypass the main pass at Thermopylae in order to outflank the Greek force. Brennus once again divided his army, leaving the main force under the command of Acichorius while he himself took a detachment through the same path used by the Persians some two centuries previously, defeating the Phocian attachment charged with guarding it. Alerted by the Phocians, the Greek coalition force abandoned Thermopylae and were evacuated by the Athenian fleet. Unwilling to wait for Acichorius, Brennus marched his warriors to the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi and according to some sources, despoiled it. The Greeks eventually succeeded in driving out the Gauls, wounding Brennus and causing his eventual death. At this point, the Gauls splintered. Some of them, including a part of the Tectosages, would cross the Hellespont and settle in Galatia. The rest were thought to have returned to their homelands in southern Gaul, bearing with them the treasures of Greece. Junianus Justinus, excerpting the work of Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus, claims that those Tectosages who returned to Tolosa suffered \\"a pestilential distemper\\" that was not dispelled until after they had thrown their plunder into the lakes.  The Disappearance of the Gold  The migrations of the Cimbri and the Teutones. During the latter part of the second century BC, a large coalition of German and Gallic tribes, which eventually included the Cimbri, the Teutones, the Boii, the Tigurini, and the Ambrones, undertook a mass migration. After inflicting several defeats on Rome, a Roman army under the command of the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus in 107 BC confronted the Tigurini near Burdigala, modern-day Bordeaux. The Romans were defeated badly and a number of Gallic tribes, including the Volcae Tectosages, revolted. A second force, under the command of the consul Quintus Servilius Caepio, was dispatched to Gallia Transalpina to restore order in 106 BC. After subduing Tolosa, Caepio reported the discovery of a massive hoard of treasure. Strabo, citing Poseidonius, said the treasure amounted to some fifteen thousand talents of gold and silver bullion, while Justinus and Orosius reports the haul at 100,000 pounds of gold and 110,000 pounds of silver. Despite orders to send the treasure to Rome, the gold never reached the city. Orosius recorded that Caepio had sent the treasure under guard to Massilia, a local Roman ally. However, the soldiers guarding the gold were slain, with the treasure itself never found again. Caepio was suspected of having stolen the gold in its entirety. The theft of the gold was soon overshadowed by Caepio's prominent role in the defeat at the Battle of Arausio in 104 BC, the greatest Roman disaster since Cannae. Now proconsul and unwilling to cooperate with his superior, the novus homo consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, Caepio, eager for glory, provoked a battle with the Cimbri.Mommsen, Theodor; The History of Rome, Book IV The end result was a rout, with at least 70,000 Roman legionaries dead, and total losses numbering over 120,000. While Caepio survived the debacle, his career did not. He was quickly stripped of his proconsular imperium and his seat in the Roman Senate. He was soon brought up on charges by the tribune of the plebs Gaius Norbanus. Charged over the loss of his army, Caepio was stripped of his Roman citizenship, fined 15,000 talents, had his property confiscated, and forbidden fire and water within eight hundred miles of Rome. He died in exile in Smyrna.  Aurum habet Tolosanum  Brutus, supposedly the last heir of the Gold of Tolosa The gold of Tolosa was never found, but was suspected to have remained in the custody of the Servilli Caepiones, who despite the total impoverishment of their patriarch, became immensely wealthy. Despite this, the heirs of Caepio also seemed to suffer from unlucky ends. During the Social War, Caepio's son, Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger was tricked by the Marsic general Quintus Poppaedius Silo and ambushed, which resulted in the destruction of his army and his own death. Caepio's grandson died young from an unnamed illness, while the last heir, Caepio's great-grandson Marcus Junius Brutus, would undertake the assassination of Julius Caesar, an action which eventually led to the rise of Octavian and the Roman Empire, and Brutus' death at the Battle of Philippi. Perhaps as a consequence of these generational misfortunes, the sources make frequent allusions to the gold being cursed. The earliest, Strabo, says that due to \\"having laid hands on [the gold of Tolosa]... Caepio ended his life in misfortunes\\", while his near-contemporary Pompeius Trogus even suggested that the defeat at Arausio was punishment for the theft of the treasure. A Latin proverb, Aurum habet Tolosanum (\\"He has got the gold of Tolosa\\"; taken to mean ‚ÄúHis ill-gotten wealth will do him no good.‚Äù) was even formed as a result.  Disagreements in the Ancient Sources  As is common, the ancient sources frequently contradict each other. Cicero is the earliest author whose extant writings mention the Gold of Tolosa, referencing the inquiry into its disappearance in De Natura Deorum, which was written in the two years before his death in 43 BC. Cicero does not mention its providence, but at least establishes that it was believed to exist. A fragment from Cassius Dio, written between 200 and 222 AD, asserts the hoard's origin as that of treasure looted from Delphi. Strabo, writing as late as 17 AD,Pothecary, Sarah, When was the Geography written? also mentions the account of the treasure's origin as the plunder of Delphi, but prefers Poseidonius' account, now lost. Quoting Poseidonius, Strabo asserted that \\"the temple at Delphi was in those times already empty of such treasure, because it had been robbed at the time of the sacred war by the Phocians.\\" Poseidonius did not believe that the Tectosages successfully brought away the plunder of Delphi to Tolosa, as they had \\"suffered wretchedly\\" during the retreat and gone in different directions. Instead, Poseidonius believed the origin of the hoard to be Gaul itself, \\"since the country was rich in gold, and also belonged to people who were god- fearing and not extravagant in their ways of living, it came to have treasures...\\" Justinus, excerpting the first century BC works of Pompeius Trogus, and Pausanias, writing in the second century AD, are the only extant sources to mention the Gallic attack on Delphi. Pausanias insisted that the Gauls did not sack the temple sanctuary and even went so far as to claim none of the Gauls survived the retreat, while Justinus' summary only states that the attack was a disaster and resulted in the fragmentation of the Gallic force, with some settling in Anatolia, others in Thrace, and a third contingent that returned to Tolosa. While Strabo, quoting Poseidonius, argued that the Temple of Apollo at Delphi lacked the treasure to be plundered as the Phocians had already taken it in during the Third Sacred War (356‚Äì346 BC), Philip of Macedon's settlement of that conflict had included the stipulation that the Phocians repay what they had plundered from the temple of Delphi at the rate of 60 talents a year.Buckley, p. 479. Excluding Phocian reparations, Pausanias' account describes a number of expensive artistic votive offerings made to the sanctuary from all over the ancient Greek world in the years preceding the invasion.

The show first aired on CBS from March 24 to July 12, 1980, with 13 episodes produced. The series aired at 8:30 P.M. ET, along with WKRP in Cincinnati, M*A*S*H and Flo on the Monday night lineup. After the show ended, Channing would not star in another sitcom until Out of Practice in 2005. Cast * Stockard Channing as Susan Goodenow * Ron Silver as Brad Gabriel * Sydney Goldsmith as Earline Cunningham * Max Showalter as Gus Clyde * Jack Somack as Mr. Kramer * Bruce Baum as Alf Serenity Plot Susan Goodenow (Channing) was a recent divorcee whose ditzy friend/neighbor Earline got her a job working as a consumer reporter for the local Los Angeles TV show The Big Rip-Off. Headlining the show was Brad Gabriel (Ron Silver) a tightly-wound journalist who was convinced everything was toxic and bad. Flamboyant Gus Clyde (Max Showalter), a former Broadway entertainer, was the station owner; Alf (Bruce Baum) was a burnout hippie who landed a job as a security guard at the station after the health food store he owned was targeted by The Big Rip- Off; and Mr. Kramer (Jack Somack) was Susan's landlord. Plots often revolved around Susan's attempts to expose corporations who were swindling consumers, which afforded Channing plenty of opportunities to don various disguises and personas. Production After wowing audiences in Grease and The Cheap Detective, CBS sets their sights on making Stockard Channing into a TV star. Channing and her then-husband, producer David Debin, were offered ownership and creative control of a movie and television series. The result were the 1979 made-for-TV movie Silent Victory: The Kitty O'Neil Story and series Stockard Channing in Just Friends. Just Friends was moderately successful and was never officially canceled, but it didn't secure a slot on the fall schedule. In March 1980, Channing returned in The Stockard Channing Show, which like Just Friends debuted as a mid-season replacement. \\"I felt last year I became the workhorse, and had to push the show along,\\" Channing told the Associated Press in 1980. \\"In doing this season, I didn't feel I desperately had to do anything to keep the show moving.\\" Although it was a completely different show, there was certainly familiar ground, beginning with the opening theme song (the same on both series). Stockard's character was again named Susan (Susan was Channing's legal first name; her last name in the series was \\"Goodenow\\" as opposed to \\"Hughes\\" in the previous) and her apartment was simply redressed. In Just Friends, Susan was in a failing marriage; for this series, she is fully divorced. Sydney Goldsmith was retained as Susan's flighty friend/neighbor, now renamed Earline. In addition to the on-screen similarities, many crew members from Just Friends were also retained. Episodes { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - ! Episode ! Title !

The film stars Isabella Calthorpe as the main female lead, and also features Gemma Atkinson, John Lynch, Joshua Bowman, Antony De Liseo and Tom Felton. Plot After spending a few years in Los Angeles, Sarah Tyler (Isabella Calthorpe) returns to her home in England. She arrives to find her brothers having a party in the barn, among which are Stephen Moore (Peter Gadiot), his girlfriend Emily (Gemma Atkinson), Charlie Moore (Gabriel Thomson), Gary Ashby (Tom Felton), Doug Walker (Joshua Bowman), their youngest brother Luke Moore (Antony De Liseo) and their dog, Stoner. Luke tells Sarah about their parents' arguments over bills, and their mother's supposed love affair. When Sarah inquires about this, Stephen reveals that her stepfather has accused her mother of having an affair with a man to whom she is paying large sums of money. The brewing storm outside causes a power outage. The group notice blood at the top of the stairs. Gary leaves the group to look for candles; meanwhile the group sees that the blood is coming from their father's room. They find his lifeless body, which appears to have been attacked by some wild animal. At the same time, Gary discovers Stoner's bloody remains. The group encounters a beast-like creature and narrowly escape. When Gary calls to them, it catches and kills him. The group flees to the bathroom, and Sarah discovers a passageway leading up to the attic. Momentarily safe, the group contemplate their situation. Emily sees a pathway leading to another room, and the group decides that Sarah shall go down and distract the beast while Charlie goes to call for help on their father's phone. While Sarah distracts the monster, Charlie contacts the police. However, the beast kills and devours him. When Sarah witnesses this, the monster pursues her, and manages to bite her leg. On the other side of town, McRae, a trained dog- catcher, is picked up by police officer May, who believes the call is a hoax, on the way to investigate Charlie's call. Back in the attic, as Doug tends to Sarah's leg, Stephen and Emily discover another passageway into a room containing a shotgun. Armed with a stake, Sarah makes her way down and injures the beast before it attacks Emily. She attempts to kill the beast with the gun, but accidentally shoots herself. McRae and May find an abandoned car in the middle of the road, and upon discovering several evidences, conclude that Charlie's call might not have been a hoax. Luke returns to the house, unaware of what's happening. He finds Gary's body and is soon pursued by the beast. After falling through the ceiling, Sarah takes Luke and the remaining survivors to the roof. McRae and May arrive but are both slain by the beast. Sarah reaches their vehicle and takes the handbag inside, which she realizes is her mother's. At the barn, Stephen tries to fix the Jeep, which he had tampered with to prevent their mother from seeing her lover. Sarah blames Stephen for the possible death of her mother, and they get into a fight. He then runs out of the barn and is attacked by the beast, while Sarah begins to transform into one as well. Luke and Doug return to the house and hide from the beast. A beast-like Sarah attacks and fights with the other beast. Doug, trying to shoot at the beast, is killed by Sarah; Luke runs back to the car. In the morning, Sarah is human again, and it is revealed that the other beast is their mother who had left to go somewhere where she could not hurt anyone, not to have a love affair. Sarah and Luke leave to go somewhere safe like their mother did. The film finishes by looking at the mauled and bloody body of Gary, who then opens his eyes and takes a breath before the screen cuts to black. This implies that the others who were bitten will come back to life.

There are 18 stores in Western Australia, one in South Australia and one in the Northern Territory. Retravision is also a commercial project supplier through Retravision Commercial, and has an online retail store Retravision Online.  History  The story of Retravision began in 1959, when a group of radio and television service agents formed the Retra TV Service Association of Victoria. Two years later, in 1961, they formalised their joint buying powers and opened a small group of retail stores in Victoria under the brand name Retravision. For almost four decades the Group grew and expanded, and for the year ended 31 December 2000, the Retravision Group turned over at retail level around $1.8 billion. By 2006, Retravision had grown to over 505 stores in Australia, stretching from Thursday Island in the North down to Hobart in Tasmania, and from the north-west of Western Australia to the east coast of Queensland and New South Wales. There were also more than 57 stores in New Zealand in both the North and South Islands. The Group started experiencing difficulties and in October 2006, Retravision NSW was placed into voluntary administration. A number of other Retravision stores joined the Harvey Norman group, becoming Harvey Norman or Joyce Mayne stores. In September 2008, Retravision's largest member, RT Edwards, sold itself to Radio Rentals South Australia (WSPL). Also in 2008, Retravision NZ decided that it would leave the Retravision group, it doing so in stages until May 2009. By this time a change in management structure meant stores in Victoria, Tasmania and southern NSW were managed by Retravision Southern, stores in Queensland and Northern NSW were managed by Retravision Northern and Retravision Western managed stores in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. In May 2012, after it came to light that Retravision Southern was having cash flow trouble, a crisis meeting was held at its Blackburn headquarters. The downfall of sales was blamed on the rise of internet-based shopping and reduced overall spending by consumers, possibly due to the Global Financial Crisis that began in 2008/2009. The directors of Retravision Southern, which owned 104 Retravision stores, put the business into voluntary administration in May 2012. This began a chain of events which would see Retravision Southern being liquidated by receivers KordaMentha. In July 2012, the administrators said of Retravision Southern: \\"Management confirmed there had been a general decline in sales over the past few years as a result of poor air conditioning seasons, price deflation on audio visual products and general economic conditions and consumer confidence.\\" In November 2012, it was announced that the Retravision name had been sold to NARTA International Limited for an undisclosed sum. The remaining member stores of Retravision were rebranded and joined other buying groups in their respective states. The exception was in Western Australia, where many stores continued trading under the Retravision name under a scheme of arrangement with Narta. In April 2017 Dorsett Retail Pty Ltd acquired a 22-year license to exclusively franchise and promote the Retravision brand in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, in a move that was expected to provide long-term stability and growth for the Retravision retailing brand. As part of this licence, Geraldton-based retailer Mitchell & Brown, a Narta member for over 15 years, transitioned to the Retravision brand, along with Murray Oakley Discount Electrical in Darwin. Dave‚Äôs Kambo‚Äôs in Harvey also took on the brand to become Dave‚Äôs Harvey Retravision. According to Dorsett Managing Director David Dorsett-Lynn, Retravision is continuing to look for opportunities in large regional centres as well as metropolitan areas.  Stores  All Retravision stores are franchised, and are privately owned and operated. In WA, Perth metropolitan stores include Cannington, Joondalup, O‚ÄôConnor and Osborne Park. Regional stores include Albany, Bridgetown, Bunbury, Busselton, Esperance, Geraldton, Harvey, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Kununnurra, Manjimup, Margaret River, Newman and South Hedland. South Australia has Retravision Kadina, and Northern Territory has Murray Oakley Discount Electrical Retravision. In addition to electrical appliances, computers and technology, several Retravision stores also specialise in furniture, homewares and bedding, including Retravision Kalgoorlie, South Hedland, Mitchell & Brown Geraldton & Busselton. Currently there are 20 stores across Australia, 18 stores in Western Australia, one in South Australia and one in the Northern Territory.  Company Structure  Retravision national support office and the head office of Dorsett Retail is located above the Bunbury Retravision retail outlet in Bunbury, WA. There are currently 20 stores within the Retravision network, with the business turning over approximately $150 million over the last 12 months. Of these stores there are six stores from the Dorsett Retail Group that represents just under half of the total turnover located at Bunbury, Cannington, Joondalup, O‚ÄôConnor, Busselton and Margaret River. There are 18 stores in Western Australia, one in South Australia at Kadina, and the Murray Oakley store in Darwin, NT. Retravision Commercial is operated by Carl Sanders and works directly with builders and developers to supply electrical appliances, hot water solutions, sanitary ware, furniture, and complete fit outs as well as many other procurement solutions. Retravision Commercial has been servicing the industries since 1961 and is part of Australia‚Äôs largest independent national buying group, Narta. Retravision Commercial continues to be an integral part of the national building and construction industry as well as mining, government, and hospitality sectors. Retravision Online. As one of Australia‚Äôs leading retailers of whitegoods, home appliances, computers and technology and home entertainment, Retravision has been able to further grow its brand by launching an online store. Retravision Online offers the same purchasing options as in-store, including its flagship promises of Lowest Price Guarantee, 60-Day Price Promise, Up To 50 Months Interest-Free, zipPay, zipMoney and Humm. Electsales is Retravision‚Äôs specialist appliance wholesaler for builders and commercial projects. Established in 1965, Electsales continues its commitment to supplying electrical and gas home appliances and hot water systems to Western Australia‚Äôs building industry. While Electsales benefits from Retravision‚Äôs buying network, it also focuses on servicing its niche role within the overall building process.  Community  Retravision stores are owned by local people, and both owners and employees are deeply involved in their local communities, particularly in the regional cities and towns. They are renowned for supporting local clubs, community events and organisations as well as sponsoring West Australian sporting teams and charities.

It was published in 1980 in London, by Allison & Busby. It was distributed in the United States by Schocken Books. A second edition was published in 1983. Following Michael Howell's death in 1986, Peter Ford published a third edition of the book in 1992. Background Joseph Carey Merrick was born in 1862 in Leicester. Within the first few years of his life it became apparent that he suffered from deformities on his face and body. These deformities grew to be significantly noticeable, and tumours on his mouth affected his speech. After leaving home, Merrick was unable to make a living and at 17 he entered Leicester Union workhouse. After four years in the workhouse, Merrick contacted a showman who agreed to exhibit him as the \\"Elephant Man\\". While on display in a penny gaff shop in London, Merrick met a surgeon named Frederick Treves who invited Merrick to the London hospital to be examined. Soon after, Merrick's exhibition was shut down by the police and Merrick travelled to Belgium under a new manager. After being robbed and abandoned, he found his way back to London and into the care of Treves. Merrick was allowed to live in rooms at the London Hospital where he became a celebrity in London's high society. He stayed there until his death in 1890. Frederick Treves wrote about Merrick's case in his memoirs of 1923. The first major work about Merrick's life was The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity by anthropologist Ashley Montagu, published in 1971. Montagu drew heavily on Treves' memoirs, and the \\"autobiographical\\" pamphlet that had been written to sell to visitors to Merrick's exhibitions. Monagu's book inspired numerous dramatic works about Merrick, notably a 1979 play by Bernard Pomerance and a 1980 film by David Lynch. Between these two works, Michael Howell and Peter Ford published their True History. Reception In a book review for Medical History, medical historian Roy Porter called the book \\"well-researched and level-headed ‚Äî easily the best offering in this year of the elephant man.\\" and noted the new material on the topic introduced by the authors. Reviewing for Postgraduate Medical Journal, M. J. Arnold praised the book, calling it \\"a comprehensive account ... of the complex interrelationships between Joseph and Treves, beautifully written...\\" Arnold went on to say \\"This is surely the last word and the true version\\" of Merrick's story. Writing for The New York Times, Anatole Broyard called the book \\"absorbing and well-balanced\\" and noted that it \\"corrects earlier versions of Merrick's life\\".

In the central pavilion is a collection of unique Romanian heraldry representing the families allied with the Cantacuzino family, as well as portraits of the family members. The castle belonged to the Cantacuzino family until the forced nationalization of 1948, when it became a preventorium for the Ministry of Internal Affairs. During the communist period, the original furniture was removed and a part of the interior walls were painted over.

It has an estimated population of 4,254 (928 households), the main ethnic groups being 37% Han, 26% Yi, 16% Tibetan, 14% Naxi and 1% Lisu. The main rivers are the Jinsha River, the Luoji River and the Niru River. Economy The vast majority in the township are employed in agriculture, taking advantage of the rich soils in the lower valleys to the south in which two crops are harvested each year, in June and October. The main crops grown are rice, wheat, corn and potatoes and many farmers rear animals. 5954 mu (m is equivalent to 0.666 or ‚Öî km¬≤) is allocated to farmland, 1,400,400 mu to pasture land and 5,900,000 mu is forest within Luoji Township. Occasionally the forest is prone to fires, one outbreak affected some 187 hectares of land and required over a thousand people to subdue it. The township is particularly noted for its matsutake mushrooms, growing wild on the hillsides rather than cultivated. They have strict rules laid down by the local government for picking, such as not to pick young mushrooms smaller than 6 cm. The township also grows a medicinal plant in the wild called chongcao, which also earns a considerable revenue. There is a pine wood crafting factory in the main town of Luoji. The township contains 15 schools, with 37 teachers and 506 students as of the last census. =Dam Project= The Diqing Prefecture Niru River Muxingtu Hydropower Station Project is proposed on the main stream of the Niru River, 5 km away from Luoji Township. The aim of the proposed project is to utilise the hydro sources of the river to provide electricity needs in Yunnan. The plant would supply energy to the China Southern Power Grid Company (CSPG) through the Yunnan Provincial Power Grid Company, capable of generating an annual 516,700 MWh, with a total installed capacity of total installed capacity of 120 MW.

History of grounds The arrival of the railroad in Chalfont heralded in new visitors to the area. In 1835, George Eckhardt opened \\"Eckhardt's Grove,\\" a park for picnics and enjoyment. Eckhardt operated the former Simon Butler mill during the first half of the 19th century and was well known for his secret counting of his profits every Saturday night by candlelight. In 1885, his mill burned down for the second time, hurting his business and in turn, the Grove. Eventually, it became known as \\"Funk's Park.\\" In 1885, the new \\"Forest Park\\" opened its doors. One of its main attractions was the music played by the Chalfont Cornet Band. Amusement park In 1930, Koons and Sanders, a partnership, bought the park. However, their business was suffering. In 1933, the Lusse Family, known for their scooters, installed a scooter ride in the park that became very popular. Later the Lusses even brought radio shows to the park, most notably the Uncle Ezra show in 1933. Soon, popularity for the park grew and in 1934, the Lusses bought the park and increased popularity. Soon, a number of amusement park rides, such as a merry- go-round and swan ride came to the park. A large swimming pool was constructed in the 1930s. In 1945, a woman was buried alive for ten days generating much local publicity and guests to the park. In 1948, Frontiertown was opened with a mini-railroad and many vintage stores. One of the chief attractions was being able to meet a real Native American, \\"Chief One Star.\\" The park was at its height in the post-war years of the 1940s. Strings bands came weekly and soon companies starting having their picnics there. One year, Budd's picnic attracted 40,000 employees to the park. Decline In the late 1950s things starting going downhill for the park. The school board levied an amusement tax. Limits were made to the special trains that brought guests to the park. However, the worst was still to come. On Memorial Day of 1958, a race riot took place, causing much damage and injuring 20 people. That day, there were around 20,000 guests at the park and during the riot many fled into the woods to escape the danger. This event marked the beginning of the end for Forest Park. In 1968 the park closed its doors forever.A History of Chalfont (1977) by the Chalfont Borough Bicentennial Committee Legacy Today, Forest Park exists only in the memories of those who loved it. At first, the grounds became a forest again, minus the old swimming pool, which remained. However, since then, neighborhoods with amusement park inspired names have sprung up on the area. For many years, the remains of the picnic groves stood along with the ruins of some buildings, a ghostly remembrance of the happy days of old. However, for those who spent countless summer days at this local gem, the golden memories much outlast the park. As of 2014, there are still the remains of concrete based park benches scattered about.http://www.creepypa.info/ForestPark.htm References Defunct amusement parks in Pennsylvania Defunct amusement parks in the United States ","title":"Forest Park, Chalfont"},{"id":"31514642","text":"Yenisey Krasnoyarsk (Russian \\"–ï–Ω–∏—Å–µ–π –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ—è—Ä—Å–∫\\") may refer to: * Yenisey Krasnoyarsk Bandy Club * BC Yenisey Krasnoyarsk, men's basketball club * FC Yenisey Krasnoyarsk, football club * Yenisey-STM Krasnoyarsk, rugby club * VC Yenisey Krasnoyarsk, women's volleyball club ","title":"Yenisey Krasnoyarsk"},{"id":"31514647","text":"Al Akhdoud Club Stadium, is a multi-use stadium in Najran, Saudi Arabia.

Vaidya, History of Mediaeval Hindu India, Vol.II, Chapter VIII: The Ninth and Tenth Centuries, A.D. ‚Äì The Happiest Period in Indian History, pp. 247‚Äì258. This article focuses on the history of this period, particularly in respect of the pre-Ghaznavid Punjab. Harsha did not leave any able successor and there was chaos after him. A great conqueror like Yashovarman is found ruling in Kannauj for some time. He joined hands with Lalitaditya of Kashmir against inroads by the Arabs and the Tibetans. But the allies fell out soon and Lalitaditya destroyed the power of Yashovarman. It was in the beginning of the ninth century that Kannauj became the capital of the Pratihara Empire and regained its renown. Meanwhile, great religious, social and political developments had taken place in the country. Religio-cultural resurgence Buddhism had been almost entirely supplanted. The great philosophers Kumarila and Shankara had re-established the Aryan (varnasharam) religion on firm though new basis, both ritually and spiritually. Islam had not yet appeared on the scene and there was no inter-religious strife. Intra- religious feuds of Hinduism ‚Äì Shaivism versus Vaishnavism and Advaita versus Dvaita ‚Äì had not yet come into existence. There was great unity of belief in the people and Shiva was the most predominant deity. The four varnas had not yet imploded into numerous hard-bound castes ‚Äì an objectionable feature of modern Hinduism.C. V. Vaidya, History of Mediaeval Hindu India, Vol. II, Preface. Also others: \\"The complete disintegration of the nation into numerous and distinct castes was subsequent to the Muslim conquest of India\\".

A high moral tone prevailing among the people struck the foreigners who visited India during this period.Al Idrisi, \\"The Indians are naturally inclined to justice and never depart from it in their actions; their good faith, honesty and fidelity to their engagements are well known and they are so famous that people flock to their country from every side and hence the country is flourishing\\". It was a great factor in contributing to happiness in the society. The deterioration began from the eleventh century. =Political upheaval= Political upheaval followed the religio-social resurgence. The conquest of Sindh by the Arabs, under a new virile religion, sent a shock wave through India and roused forces of opposition to foreign faith and domination among the orthodox population. The Guhilots of Mewar under Bappa Rawal (c. 750 CE), the Chahamanas of Shakambhari under Samanta and the Pratiharas of Mandor under Nagabhata I obtained renown by opposing the Arabs surging forward from Sindh towards Rajputana for conquest as well as conversion.C. V. Vaidya, History of Mediaeval Hindu India, Vol. II, p. iv. Also The Age of Imperial Kanauj, Foreword by K. M. Munshi, p. ix: \\"About 725 CE, Junaid the Sindh governor of Caliph Hasham of Baghdad sent an army for conquest of India. It over ran Saurashtra, Bhilamala (near Abu) and reached Ujjayni\\". The world conquering Arabs were contained within Sindh where they managed to survive. Chandellas of Bundelkhand and Kalluchuries of Chedi were the other Kshatriya families that gained prominence. Our focus is on the ninth and tenth centuries. The Rashtrakutas had established themselves in the Deccan Plateau. The Palas were ruling in Bengal. Kannauj became the national capital of the Pratiharas (c. 815 CE), setting in motion a tripartite struggle between these three large kingdoms for all India supremacy and the prized imperial capital of Kannauj. But what was happening in the north-west India ‚Äì that is Punjab? History of pre-Ghaznavid Punjab There is some inscriptional evidence that Dharmapala King of Bengal (770‚Äì810 CE) established sovereignty over Uttarapatha (Northern India) and held a magnificent Durbar in Kannauj in which, among others, the rulers of Gandhara, Kira (Kangra), Madara (Central Punjab), Yadu (Singhpura?), Kura (Thanesar), Avanti (Malwa) and Matsya (Jaipur) were present, \\"bowing down respectfully with their diadems trembling\\".R. S. Tripathi, History of Ancient India, p. 356 quoting Epigraphia Indica, IV, pp. 228, 252. Also The Age of Imperial Kanauj, p. 46:‚ÄùThese states were not annexed by Dharamapala, but their rulers acknowledged his suzerainty\\". No further details are available about the identity of these rulers, or their mutual struggle for supremacy after Dharmapala's influence waned and his prot√©g√© Chakrayudha lost the throne of Kannauj. Khomana Rasa, the most ancient of the poetic chronicles of Mewar, describes a formidable invasion of Chittor by Arab Muslims during the reign of Khoman I (812‚Äì836 CE). This Guhilot King successfully defended the \\"crimson standard\\" of Mewar, treated with contempt the demand of tribute and drove back the \\"barbarian\\". According to Khoman Rasa the capital of Lahore was then held by the tribe of \\"boosa\\" who came to the succour of Chittor, along with many other rulers, to throw back this invasion from Khurasan.James Todd, Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan,Vol. I, pp. 196‚Äì202. Fresh historical evidence According to another significant source, it was during this period of resurgence that a Brahmana chief named Raja Bachan Pala established his dynasty in the Punjab in the early ninth century. It can only be presumed that, like other stalwarts of that period, his rise to power may also be related to his role in the grand confederacy against the Arabs. After a long rule, Bachan Pala died in 866 CE when he was succeeded by his son Raja Ram Singh who ruled up to 891 CE. He was followed by his son Raja Bir Singh. Hutpala, the only son and heir designate (yuvaraja) ascended the throne after his father's death in 936 CE.Raizada Harichand Vaid, Gulshane Mohyali, II, pp. 80‚Äì82. Gradually the dynasty had gained control of the area roughly between the rivers Satluj and Sindh. There is reliable information about another political revolution during the early ninth century, across river Sindh, in Kabul. Southern Afghanistan south of Koh Hindu Kush, was then, culturally and politically, part of Hindu India. The Brahmana Vazir, named Kallar, put the incompetent Kshatriya Buddhist ruler of Kabul in prison and established himself on the throne. This event may have taken place around 840 CE but the date cannot be confirmed. After Kallar ruled \\"the Brahmanas Samand (Samanta), whose successor was Kamalva (Kamalavarman), whose successor was BhimaEdward C. Sachau, Tr. Al Beruni‚Äôs India, Vol. II, p. 13. ‚Ä¶‚Äù They ruled with power and glory for more than one century and \\"other kings found safety under them\\". Amalgamation of kingdoms of Punjab and Kabul Bhima, the last king of this dynasty, died without a male heir and his kingdom came under the jurisdiction of Prithvipala, the then ruler of Punjab. Prithvipala died in the following year and his son Jayapala succeeded to the combined kingdoms of Punjab and Kabul.Raizada Harichand Vaid, Gulshane Mohyali, II, pp.82. This brought the Punjab dynasty into prominence. Jayapala's successors ‚Äì Anandapala, Trilochanapala, and Bhimapala (Nidar Bhima or fearless Bhima) ‚Äì are well known in history from the accounts left by Al- Beruni, Al-Utbi, Kalhana Pandit and other chroniclers. They stoutly defended the Punjab ‚Äì but we should first introduce their adversaries ‚Äì the Ghaznavids ‚Äì before stating their history. This takes us back to Afghanistan. Arab failure in southern Afghanistan Within hundred years of the advent of Islam, the Arabs had conquered vast areas in three continents from Sindh to Spain and Khorasan to Morocco. However, in spite of repeated campaigns they could not occupy the Kandahar-Ghazni-Kabul land route leading to the Khyber Pass ‚Äì the strategic gateway to India. Two Hindu states of Zabul and Kabul (Southern Afghanistan) stubbornly defended their territory. The Arabs ceased to be a strong political power by 800 CE and their governors and the newly converted tribes started establishing their independent kingdoms in the far flung regions of the caliphate. It is of considerable interest here that in the beginning of the ninth century a strong Muslim dynasty of Persian origin ‚Äì the Samanids ‚Äì came up at Bukhara (c. 819‚Äì1005\`CE) and occupied the whole of the eastern caliphate.C. V. Vaidya, History of Mediaeval Hindu India, Vol. III, pp. 10‚Äì13. Unconnected with the political churning in India during this period, they were capitalising on the waning political power of the caliphs of Baghdad. Under the Samanids, Central Asia prospered with notable expansion of industry and commerce. As in the case of India, the ninth and tenth centuries were a period of great prosperity for Central Asia also. And there was a common link. Caravans engaged in international trade started from Kannauj, with valuable goods from India, travelled peacefully through the intermediate kingdoms of Punjab and Kabul and reached Bukhara, for onward journey to join the famed \\"silk route\\" linking China and Europe. There were also auxiliary east‚Äìwest trade routes, in conjunction with this north‚Äìsouth route. From Bhera, situated in the Salt Range in Punjab, some traders moved westward to Multan for joining the caravans going to the Middle East via Sindh and Makran. Likewise some trade moved westward from Kabul through Ghazni. It needs highlighting that the intermediate Brahmana kingdoms of Punjab and Kabul, which were probably affiliated as a sort of confederacy, maintained a perfect \\"balance of power\\" against their belligerent neighbours, namely the Pratiharas of Kannauj to their east and the Samanids of Bukhara to their west ‚Äì apart from Kashmir and Multan. Since no battles were reported during the long (pre- Ghaznavid) period, the Brahmana rulers of these middle kingdoms received very little notice in contemporary chronicles ‚Äì making it a \\"dark period\\" for modern historians. It has gone un-noticed that India not only benefited economically from smooth conduct of international trade but politically also. Turkish Sultanate at Ghazni \\"Royal families gradually tend to deteriorate in kingly values and become old and rotten\\". In course of time the Samanids interested themselves in \\"high culture\\" and left the affairs of their state, including the governorships of the provinces, to Turk nobles. Scramble for power ensued and ambitious persons started carving fiefdoms for themselves. A strong Sultanate came up at Ghazni, then a province of the Samanid kingdom. Sabuktagin, a former slave (door keeper) occupied its throne in 977 CE. Within twelve years of his reign he had extended his frontiers to the Oxus on the north and the present boundary between Persia (Iran) and Afghanistan.Wolseley Haig, The Cambridge History of India, Vol. III, p. 12. He then started nibbling at the Brahmana Shahi state of Kabul, then ruled by Jayapala. Jayapala It has already been stated that after Bhimadeva Shahi, Jayapala ‚Äì a scion of the reigning dynasty of Punjab ‚Äì became the ruler of the combined kingdoms of Punjab and Kabul c. 960 CE. On his coronation Jayapala adopted the additional deva name-ending of his predecessor dynasty and was known as Jayapaladeva Shahi. Barikot Inscription refers to him as ‚ÄúParamabhattarka maharajadhiraja parmeshwvara‚Äù (supreme sovereign, the superior king of great kings and supreme lord).D. R. Sahni, \\"Six Inscriptions in the Lahore Museum\\" Epigraphia Indica, Vol. xxi, 1931‚Äì32, p. 299. He reorganised his administration, leaving the ancestral territory of Punjab under his son Anandapala and directly governing Afghanistan region from their national capital of Udabhandapura ‚Äì situated fourteen miles above Attock on the right side of river Sindh. He reigned peacefully for some time. Observing the Turkish menace he decided to nip the evil in bud. With this aim he twice attacked Ghazni but failed in his purpose. The whole of his domain north of the Khyber Pass was gradually lost to him ‚Äì including the town of Kabul. He continued to rule from Udabhandapura. Sabuktagin also got deeply involved in the affairs of his overlord, the Samanid King of Bukhara. Mahmud ascends the throne of Ghazni Sabuktagin died in 997 CE. After a brief war of succession his son Mahmud ascended the throne of Ghazni in the following year. Like his father, Mahmud first consolidated his position in the west. The tottering Samanid Kingdom was given a shove and their dominion divided by Mahmud and Ilak Khan of Kashghar, with Oxus as the boundary. The great Samanid Kingdom virtually came to an end in 999 CE. Mahmud now stood in the place of the Samanids, his former overlords, in direct subordination to the caliph.K. A. Nizami, Ed. Politics and Society during the Early Medieval Period, by Mohammad Habib, p. 46. Having acquired considerable fighting experience and a seasoned army Mahmud was ready to deal with 'Hind'. In 1001 CE Mahmud marched against Jayapala and pitched his tents before Peshawar. On 28 November 1001, in the Battle of Peshawar the two armies fell on each other and \\"did justice to their traditions of warlike courage\\". Mahmud was victorious ‚Äì and Afghanistan was lost to Hindu India.Elliot and Dowson, History of India as Told by Its Own Historians, Translation of extracts from Tarikh Yamini, by Al Utbi. Centuries- old civilizational links were severed as the population of Afghanistan was converted to Islam, like other conquered territories. Anandapala Anandapala, son of Jayapala, succeeded to the truncated Shahi Kingdom in 1002 CE. His kingdom of Punjab was the biggest obstacle in Mahmud's passage to the riches of India but there were also two allies of Anandapala ‚Äì Abdul Fateh Daud of Multan and Bijay Rai of Bhatia (modern Uch: 29.13N, 71.09E) south-west of Multan.Wolseley Haig, The Cambridge History of India, Vol. III, pp. 14. Historians have erroneously confused Bhatia with Bhera. Located near the Salt Range in West Punjab, Mahmud had yet to fight several battles to reach that area. For this ‚Äì and details of other topics discussed here ‚Äì see R. T. Mohan, Afghanistan Revisited: The Brahmana Hindu Shahis of Afghanistan and the Punjab (c. 840‚Äì1026 CE) (Delhi, 2010), pp. 123‚Äì124 and 143. As a matter of strategy Mahmud decided to first clear his flank. In 1004 Mahmud proceeded by way of southern Afghanistan and crossing river Sindh in the neighbourhood of Multan, where he attacked Bhatia. Raja Bijay Rai, the king of the wealthy state of Bhatia came out of his fort and engaged the Turks for three days. \\"Although the Mahomadans advanced with great impetuosity they were frequently repulsed with slaughter\\". But Bhatia was taken and there was great pillage and slaughter. All inhabitants who refused to be converted to Islam were killed. Mosques were constructed and Islamic teachers appointed. The kingdom of Bhatia \\"with its dependencies\\" was annexed to Mahmud's own dominion. During his return the rivers were swollen and foaming and Mahmud was harassed by his adversaries. He lost greater part of his baggage and barely managed to save his life. Mahmud next decided to attack the hostile principality of Multan. Because of his earlier experience, this time he decided to come through the Khyber Pass, beyond which lay Anandapala's kingdom. On a request being made for the passage, Anandapala refused peremptorily. Abdul Fateh Daud solicited the aid of his ally Anandapala, who true to his alliance dispatched a strong contingent of his army to oppose the Turks at Peshawar but it was defeated. When Daud \\"heard what had happened to the Chief of Hind notwithstanding his power\\" he lost courage and did not offer resistance. Daud offered a yearly tribute of 20,000 golden Dirhams as the price of peace and abjuration of heretical doctrines.Elliot and Dowson, History of India as Told by Its Own Historians, Vol.II, Translation of extracts from Tarikh Yamini, by Al Utbi, p. 31. Before the Sultan could bring the outlying parts of Multan under his control he had to rush back to deal with Ilak Khan of Kashghar who had invaded his territory. A terrible battle followed in which Ilak Khan was defeated. First battle for Punjab Having secured his rear and western flank, Mahmud started his next campaign to Hind with full preparation in December 1008. Anandapala was not caught unawares and had collected a large force. There was large public enthusiasm to throw back the Turks. When Mahmud crossed the Khyber Pass he was met by Trilochanapala, son of Anandapala, at the head of a well equipped army. The Hindu army was encamped between Waihind and Peshawar and surrounding the Mahomedans \\"who were obliged to entrench their camps so that infidels might not be able to penetrate therein\\". Both armies faced each other for forty days, each hesitating to commence the offensive. Getting apprehensive of the daily increasing number of Hindu troops, Mahmud ordered six hundred archers to the front to provoke the enemy to attack his encampments. The archers were opposed by the Gakhars who, with their heads and feet bare, penetrated in to the Turkish lines and in a dreadful carnage killed 5000 Mahomedans in a few minutes. \\"The battle lasted from morning till evening and the infidels (i.e. Hindus) were near getting victory.Elliot and Dowson, History of India..., Vol.II, p. 33‚Äù But \\"on a sudden the elephant of the prince who commanded the Hindus became unruly from the effect of the naptha balls and the flight of arrows, turned and fled. The circumstance produced a panic among the Hindus, who seeing themselves deserted by their general, gave way and fled also.John Briggs, Tr. History of the Rise of the Mahomedan Power in India of Mahomed Kasim Ferishta, Vol. I, p. 27.‚Äù Retreating Hindu forces were pursued and killed in large numbers. Raid on Nagarkot Mahmud must have collected intelligence about the immense wealth in the temple of Bhimanagar (modern Nagarkot) because he next attacked that place. Ferishta states that Mahmud \\"invested the place with such speed that Hindus had no time to throw troops for its defence.John Briggs' Ferishta, Vol.I, p. 28.‚Äù Mahmud entered the place after stiff resistance for a few days. The booty was beyond imagination and it whetted the Sultan's appetite to rob similar places of Hindu worship. Peace treaty Anandapala's kingdom, whatever was left of it, still blocked Mahmud's passage through the Punjab. The Shahis had to buy peace, and time, for the next conclusive contest which was inevitable. In a pragmatic move a treaty was concluded with Mahmud. Under this Sultan promised not to lead any invasions against the Shahi kingdom but his troops were to be allowed to pass through Punjab. Utbi records that \\"peace was established and the caravans travelled in full security between Khurasan and Hind\\". Anandapala appears to have died during this period of comparative peace, between 1010 and 1011 CE. Trilochanapala Trilochanapala ascended the Shahi throne after the death of his father Anandapala. Though more famous as the Kings of Lahore, the temple fort at Nandana, fourteen miles south-west of Choha Saidan Shah (near Katas Raj), situated on a remarkable dip of the outer salt range, had been a stronghold of the Vaid dynasty ruling Punjab. Lying midway between Lahore and Waihind, it must have served as the national capital of the Shahis after loss of Waihind. Ensconced in the mountain of Balanath, it had a strong fort and was strategically located not too far from the commercial town of Bhera and the river Jhelum. Peace treaties between states are means of achieving national aims without resorting to war. Sultan Mahmud must have realised that the Shahis were not very pliable. He would not feel safe about his rear if he advanced deep into India beyond the territory controlled by the Shahis. So he decided to first attack the Shahi capital at Nandana and crush Trilochanapala. Mahmud collected a large army in the spring of 1014 and marched toward Nandana. When Trilochanapala became aware of the intentions of the Turk, he entrusted the defence of Nandana to his son Bhimapala ‚Äì whom Utbi refers as Niddar Bhima (the fearless Bhima). The Shahis summoned their vassals and meanwhile Bhimapala advanced with his forces to take position behind the wings of a hill pass ‚Äì probably Marigala Pass near Rawal Pindi. He positioned his elephants in the entrance of the narrow and precipitous pass while his forces occupied the hills on both sides. He thus waited in security while reinforcements kept arriving. Mahmud found himself outmanoeuvred and his spearmen failed to provoke the Hindus. \\"When his vassals had joined Bhimapala he left his entrenchments and came out into the plain, having the hills behind him and elephants drawn up on each wing. The battle raged furiously\\". A general leading the Turkish vanguard was wounded grievously and Mahmud dispatched part of his own guards to extricate his commander. The conflict continued as before but the Turks were victorious at the end. Bhimapala survived the battle and escaped, entrusting the defence of their fort at Nandana to some of their devoted veterans. Mahmud advanced promptly to invest the fort. There was stiff resistance and Mahmud asked his sappers to lay mines under the walls, while the Turkish archers poured arrows into the fort. Finally the garrison surrendered. He next led is forces towards Kashmir to chase and destroy the Shahi King. Meanwhile, Trilochanapala had gone towards Kashmir along with some of his forces, to seek assistance from Sangramaraja, the ruler of Kashmir (1003‚Äì1028), who consented to help. Tunga, the commander of Kashmir forces, was sent at the head of a contingent consisting of several nobles, feudal chiefs and other ranks. From previous experience of battles with the Turks, Trilochanapala had devised a strategy quite similar to that followed by Bhimapala of blocking the advance of large Turkish army from behind a hill pass and later fighting on a restricted battlefield in the backdrop of these hills. He had advised Tunga accordingly. However, in his impetuosity Tunga came out in hasty moves. Mahmud found an opportunity to strike with full force and Tunga's army dispersed. Trilochanapala tried to control the situation but was unsuccessful. Having routed the Hindu forces, Mahmud plundered the area, took many prisoners and converted much of the populace to Islam. Rajatarangini, a history of Kashmir, also gives a detailed account of this particular battle because forces of Kashmir state were involved in it.M. A. Stein, Tr. Kalhana‚Äôs Rajatarangini, VII, Verses 47 to 63, pp. 270‚Äì72. Also, Elliot and Dowson, History of India by Its Own Historians, Vol. II, pp. 38ff and Appendix, p. 452. This was a severe blow which almost destroyed the Shahis as a strong reigning power. But they were not yet completely wiped out. Mahmud was still not confident of advancing deep into India with the bruised and mauled Shahis in his rear. He organised some probing campaigns to test political waters. Plunder of Thanesar Mahmud had gathered information that Thanesar had an idol Jugsoma (Chakraswamin) and the place was as holy in the eyes of Hindus as Mecca to Muslims. It was another potential Nagarkot and Mahmud organised a quick foray. Thanesar was under the jurisdiction of the Delhi Kingdom. Ferishta states that the Shahi ruler tried to dissuade Mahmud from his resolution in exchange for an annual tribute but it did not work. The Shahi warned Bijayapala, the Towar Raja of Delhi, about the impending danger but the Hindus were too slow in organising a joint defence. A Raja named Ram, probably the ruler of Thanesar, came out to stop the Turkish force, but lost. Mahmud continued his march to Thanesar, plundered the city and destroyed a large number of idols. The chief idol was carried to Ghazni for defilement. Unsuccessful siege of Lohkot In an effort to destroy the Shahi vestige and enter Kashmir, Mahmud besieged the fort of Lohkot in 1015 CE. Lohkot was remarkable on account of its height and strength. Mahmud failed to subdue this fort or get past it and enter Kashmir. According to Ferishta, Mahmud returned to Ghazni with great difficulty \\"having failed in all the enterprises of this campaign.John Briggs, Tr. History of the Rise of the Mahomedan Power in India of Mahomed Kasim Ferishta, Vol. I, p. 32.‚Äù Expedition to Kannauj With Punjab subdued, time was ripe for Sultan Mahmud to organise a campaign for plundering the famed riches of temples and kingdoms of mid-India. In 1018 CE he fitted a large army of 100,000 chosen horse and 20,000-foot and marched towards India. In a long journey he crossed all the rivers of Punjab and put his forces across the Yamuna by 2 December 1018. Trilochanapala who was still ruling eastern Punjab refused to pay allegiance and sheltered himself in the Parmar kingdom of Malwa. Mahmud destroyed several big and small kingdoms: Baran (modern Bulandshahr), Mahaban, Mathura, Kannauj, Munj, Asi and Sharva. There was a varying degree of resistance or lack of it. For example, at Munj known as \\"the fort of Brahmanas\\" the garrison resisted the invader for 25 days and died fighting heroically literally to the last man and not a single soul survived in the fort. Kannauj, the Imperial capital of India was then ruled by Gurjara Prathara Rajyapala. After the outlying forts were reduced, Rajyapala left Kannauj to wait for another day. Mahmud's share of the plunder from this campaign consisted of two crore dirhams of gold and silver bullion, 5300 captives, 350 elephants, besides jewels pearls and other precious effects. Nor was the spoil of the army less than which came into the public treasury.R. C. Majumdar, The Struggle for Empire, p. 13. The last Shahi effort to turn the tide The Chandel of Kalanjar had formed a confederacy of some Hindu states and they killed Rajyapala of Kannauj for his cowardly submission to Mahmud. Still hoping to turn the tide and regain his kingdom, Trilochanapala Shahi had also joined the confederacy. The Chandella ruler had promised to bring an army to Punjab but procrastinated. So Trilochanapala marched with his forces to join the Chandella for a joint front against the Turks. In 1019 CE Mahmud set out from Ghazni \\"with an army greater than any which he had hitherto led into India\\" pre-empting moves regarding joining of the Shahi and Chandella forces. \\"Mahmud traversed stages after stages and overtook Purujayapala (Trilochanapala) and his forces on the 14th of Saban: between him and the Hindus was a deep river\\". Trilochanapala determined to resist the passage of Sultan. Mahmud hesitated to attempt the crossing of the turbulent and muddy river. One night however eight Muslim officers, each followed by his troops, crossed the river apparently without the King's knowledge. Entering the camp early morning by surprise, when Hindu soldiers were not yet through from their routine morning ablutions, they struck panic among the enemy ranks. The Shahi was worsted in this sudden encounter and escaped. \\"Two hundred and eighty eight gigantic elephants fell into the hands of the Mussalamans\\" among other booty. Trilochanapala made another attempt to join up with Vidyadhar Chandella for the next decisive battle. But history has no record of him from this point. According to Tarikh ul-Kamil, Trilochanapala was wounded after fighting for greater part of the day. He may not have survived the forced march towards Kalanjar.H. C. Ray, The Dynastic History of Northern India, Vol. I, pp. 508‚Äì609. Also, Cambridge History of India, Vol. III, pp. 21‚Äì22. Confrontation with Chandelas The Chandela king Vidyadhara had fielded 36,000 cavalry, 124,000 infantry and 640 elephants at the border of his kingdom. \\"Sultan reconnoitred the opposing army from an eminence and observing the vast numbers he regretted having come thither. Prostrating before God, he prayed for success and victory\\". The engagement was probably indecisive and Vidyadhara retreated during the night possibly with the horses and elephants that could be retrieved. Sultan ordered the camp to be looted and did not advance further into Chandella territory. \\"Mahmud who was apprehensive of the disturbances in the Punjab, returned content with this victory to Ghazni\\". The exemplary resolve displayed by the Shahis was conspicuously absent amongst most of their fellow kings.John Keay, INDIA; A HISTORY, p. 21 (Harper Collins Publishers India, 2000). (John Keay) One cannot but speculate what would have been the outcome of this engagement if the intrepid Trilochanapala, who had a steely determination and experience of battling the Turks, been in command of the ample forces of Vidyadhara Chandella on that fateful day. Al Beruni, who came to India in the train of Mahmud Ghaznavi and was a contemporary of these Brahmana Shahis, paid a touching tribute: According to Al Beruni, Bhimapala succeeded his father Trilochanapala \\"and after five years under him the sovereignty of Hind became extinct and no descendant remained to light a fire on the hearth\\". In 1021 CE Mahmud again marched towards Kashmir. \\"The fort of Lohkot was invested. A month was spent there. As the fort was strong it could not be taken\\". Frustrated and enraged, Mahmud decamped and next proceeded to Lahore, the formal capital of the Shahis. He entered the city without opposition giving it over to be sacked by the troops. He appointed one of his officers to the Government and nominated other commanders to various districts before returning to Ghazni. The Punjab was finally annexed to the dominion of Ghazni after stubborn resistance, to the last man, by the Shahis for quarter of a century. Briggs, the translator of Ferishta remarks: \\"Thus after 23 years we find the Muslim governors, left in India, east of the Indus\\". Islam had acquired a springboard for future forays in to the heartland of India.

A winger, he is known for his rapid speed, nimble feet and trademark 'double somersault' goal celebrations. He has also represented the England C national football team as a midfielder. Having played for many different clubs Henry may be considered a journeyman. Club career =Early career= Born in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Henry began his career with Luton Town as a youngster, but was released at the age of 15, being told by then Luton youth coach Dean Rastrick that he was \\"too small\\". He then played local football for Buntingford Town and then Arlesey Town at the age of 17, before signing for Wycombe Wanderers on non-contract terms on 21 November 2005. Released by the Chairboys, Henry signed for Grays Athletic in March 2006. =Haverhill Rovers= Shin splints put an end to his time with Grays and he moved to Haverhill Rovers in July 2006. He scored some vital goals at the Croft ground, helping Haverhill reach the FA Cup Fourth Qualifying Round for the first time in their 125-year history during the 2006‚Äì07 campaign, before the minnows finally bowed out to Aldershot Town. =Cambridge City= His form alerted Cambridge City manager Gary Roberts and he was soon thrust into the Lilywhites side where he impressed, bagging 6 goals in 31 appearances. He became something of a crowd favourite at Milton Road with his penetrating runs, powerful shots and wild 'somersault' goal celebrations. =Dorchester Town= Such was his form at Cambridge City, that it alerted the attentions of Dorchester Town, who signed Henry on a two-year contract in July 2007 for a fee of ¬£7,500. With Dorchester having just turned professional, it represented a chance for Henry to play football on a full-time basis. =Havant & Waterlooville= After just three months at the Avenue Stadium, and six goals in 18 appearances, he signed for Havant & Waterlooville on 23 November 2007 for an undisclosed fee. =Newport County= After 16 appearances and 2 goals for the Hawks during the 2007‚Äì08 campaign, Henry made a big impact for Havant & Waterlooville during the 2008‚Äì09 season, netting 6 goals in just 21 appearances. His form alerted several other clubs and, out-of-contract in the summer of 2009, he eventually signed for Newport County on 18 June 2009, under the management of Dean Holdsworth, on a one-year contract, after scoring several times against the Exiles for his former clubs. He became a fan favourite at Spytty Park and he fired nine goals in 35 appearances during his first season with the Exiles, the 2009‚Äì10 campaign, as Newport won the Conference South title with a record 103 points. On 25 May 2010, Henry signed a new one-year contract with the club. Playing at Conference Premier level for the first time in his career, Henry was again a key figure for Newport County during the 2010‚Äì11 campaign as the Exiles were the surprise package in the league and play-off contenders in the first half of the season. =Luton Town= After scoring at Kenilworth Road for Newport County in a 1‚Äì1 draw on 24 August 2010 he was on the radar of Luton manager Richard Money, who had already been impressed with Henry after spotting him in a pre-season match against Stevenage. On 26 November 2010, Henry signed for Luton, initially on loan, before making the move permanent on 5 January 2011, returning to Kenilworth Road nine years after being released as a 15-year-old. Although delighted to be joining Luton Town ‚Äì an opportunity Henry said was too good to turn down ‚Äì he did express his sadness at leaving Newport County, saying, \\"It's very difficult and in a lot of ways I am gutted to be leaving. I've had the best two years of my life down here and the best time in my career by an absolute mile.\\" Upon returning to Luton, Henry expressed his delight at being given a second opportunity with the Hatters. However, a detached ligament in his foot sustained whilst playing for Newport County proved more serious than initially thought by the Luton Town medical staff, and Henry was sidelined for the remainder of the 2010‚Äì11 season with an injury that manager Richard Money described as \\"one in a million\\". Henry eventually made his debut for Luton the next season, coming on as a substitute in the club's 5‚Äì1 victory against Hendon in the FA Cup Fourth Qualifying Round on 29 October 2011, 11 months after initially joining the club. Henry described his appearance as \\"unbelievable\\" and admitted there were times during his injury where he thought his career was over. On 24 November 2011, Henry was sent on a two- month loan to League Two side Aldershot Town to build up match fitness. He made six appearances before returning to Luton on 22 January 2012. Henry made his first league appearance for Luton as a substitute in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Darlington on 13 March 2012. He ended the season having played six games for the club, before being released on 30 April. =Macclesfield Town= In 2012 Henry joined Macclesfield Town. On 8 February 2013 he joined A.F.C. Telford United on a one-month loan. On 14 March, Henry decided to terminate his contract with Macclesfield Town after failing to settle in the area. =Team Wellington= In November 2013, Henry made the move to New Zealand to sign for ASB Premiership club Team Wellington, signing a contract until March 2014. He made an immediate impact, scoring on his first home starting appearance in a 3‚Äì1 win over Southern United on 24 November 2013. He went on to score regularly, taking his tally of goals to six in eleven appearances when netting twice in a 6‚Äì1 victory over Hawke's Bay United on 2 February 2014. =Dunstable Town= After a stint in New Zealand's ASB Premiership for Team Wellington, Henry signed for Dunstable Town in the summer of 2014 following their promotion to the Southern Premier Division.http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/three-more-impressive- signings-32351/ International career Henry's form with Newport County in 2010 earned him a call-up to the England C national football team squad, where he made his debut in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Wales. A month later, he earned his second cap, picking up the man-of-the-match award in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Estonia U23 in Tallinn in the International Challenge Trophy.

Written and directed by Miguel Coyula, the story is based on a novel by Edmundo Desnoes, also the author of the 1968 classic Memories of Underdevelopment. This independent film was produced by David Leitner and features Cuban actor, Ron Blair as the lead character. It is the first Cuban dramatic feature film with scenes filmed both in Cuba and the United States. After its world Premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, it garnered several awards and honors. The International Film Guide described it as one of the best films Cuba has produced. Plot Sergio Garcet is an intellectual who abandons the Cuban Revolution and 'underdevelopment' behind only to find himself at odds with the ambiguities of his new life in the 'developed' world. Highly episodical, the film consists of flashbacks, daydreams, and hallucinations comprising live-action, animation, and newsreel footage assembled to suggest the way personal memory works, subjectively and emotionally. Production Production of ‚ÄúMemorias del Desarrollo‚Äù took five years, starting in 2005 and completed in 2010, with locations in five countries. According to Director Miguel Coyula, his first draft of the screenplay was a faithful adaptation of Edmundo Desnoes' novel. But as he began filming and editing simultaneously, he became aware of new possibilities, which would radically alter the narrative structure of the original novel as well as its characters. The film did not follow the traditional chronology of writing, shooting and editing. This required a new approach where pre-production, production and postproduction no longer needed to exist as distinct elements but rather as an integral interactive seamless process. This new way of working was not meant as a shortcut, but rather as a way of revealing new narrative layers of the work as it evolved to create the director‚Äôs personal vision. Coyula would take advantage of everything around him that he thought would add to the film, heavily manipulating images digitally, into the film‚Äôs final highly fragmented narrative. For example, the scenes with the 9/11 footage, which the director had recorded years before; the Paris, London and Tokyo scenes, which were shot while Coyula was travelling invited to film festivals presenting his film Red Cockroaches. Most of the various location shoots were done without permits, through favors from friends, and with a minimal crew consisting mostly of director Miguel Coyula, producer David W. Leitner and lead actor Ron Blair, easily adapting at a moment‚Äôs notice and without the constraints of a rigid schedule. The film's most decisive work however took place in the editing room. In several visual presentations Coyula stated that no shot in the film escaped digital manipulation of some kind, which included, green screen, compositing in recreating sets, double exposures, replacing backgrounds, changing lighting, weather conditions, performing digital art direction, and actors shot in different countries performing together on screen. Producer David Leitner initially hoped to raise 2 million dollars for the project. But after realizing there was no interest from film production companies neither in North or South America, they reverted to a strategy closer to Coyula's first feature, Red Cockroaches. The film was funded by executive producers Steve Pieczenik, and Suzana Dejkanovic, associate producers Juan Martinez, and Michael Ferris Gibson as well as the Guggenheim Fellowship Coyula was awarded in 2009 for this project. While working on a low budget delayed completion by five years, it also allowed Coyula to have total creative control of the film. Reception Memorias del Desarrollo received almost unanimous positive reviews throughout its Film Festival run. An initial negative review by Variety‚Äôs Robert Koehler after its premiere at Sundance, described the film as ‚Äúan unfortunate follow up to Tomas Gutierrez Alea‚Äôs masterpiece‚Ä¶ the erratically edited film misses Desnoes' rhythm and poetics, coming off as borderline amateur.‚Äù Subsequently James Greenberg from Hollywood Reporter considered it ‚ÄúThoughtful and cinematically bold... an affecting portrait of modern man becoming more and more isolated from a world he helped to create.‚Äù B√©r√©nice Reynaud at Senses of Cinema wrote ‚ÄúCoyula ups the ante by over- compositing the image and saturating the colors, creating a complex kaleidoscope, which in turns dictates the editing of the sequences in a kinetic, non-linear way. Paralleling free association, the structure blurs the lines between actual events, fake memories, projections, irritation at American pop culture, political anger, rambling and resentments‚Ä¶ These techniques allow Coyula to further destabilize his character, to create a palpable tension between the film and Desnoes‚Äô text, and to eventually reappropriate (or salvage) his trajectory in exile.‚Äù Latin American Film Scholar Michael Chanan declared it ‚ÄúA dazzling and disconcerting work of great bravado‚Ä¶ A paradigm for a new digital cinema beholden to no orthodoxy.‚Äù Cuban writer and critic Orlando Luis Pardo wrote in Diario de Cuba that the film was ‚ÄúA memorable moment in the Cuban Arts‚Äù.

He was reported dead on the evening of Friday 8 April 2011 in the residential area of Khomasdal, Windhoek where he committed suicide using an electric wire. Keharanjo just like an ordinary Mbanderu young boy spent his early years tending his father‚Äôs livestock at Ezorongondo, Omaheke Region. In 1988, his father took him to Ondauha in Botswana, about from Maun, to the grave of Keharanjo‚Äôs grandfather, Chief Keharanjo I Nguvauva. There he was introduced to the Mbanderu community as a future chief. Nguvauva was then taken to the house of Chief Mathiba Moremi of Batawana, for him to be groomed to be a leader.

Keharanjo graduated with an LLB from the University of Western Cape in Cape Town, South Africa in 2010. He was employed as a legal advisor in the Namibian Ministry of Justice.

Background The cartoon's name was inspired by Africa Before Dark. Plot Oswald was riding through the Egyptian desert on his camel. The camel, though looking real on the exterior, is actually mechanical because of the two ball-shaped pistons inside which Oswald manipulates with his feet like bike pedals. One day, a lion was running toward them. To defend himself, Oswald brought out a rifle but it malfunctioned. As a final resort, Oswald fired the ball pistons from the camel like a cannon and aimed into the lion's mouth. Terrified by its lumpy back, the lion runs away in panic. Nearby where he is, Oswald saw an oasis and a palace. Upon seeing the apes dance and play instruments, the curious rabbit decides to join the fun. As he entered the palace, Oswald was greeted by the queen. The queen asked him who he is, and Oswald introduced himself in a song as well as giving advice for a possibly better lifestyle. Pleased by his visit, the queen asked Oswald if he would like to be her king. Oswald was at first uncertain, knowing he never met a queen, but immediately accepted. It turns out momentarily that the queen still has a king who shows up, then kicks Oswald out of the palace and into a pond full of crocodiles. Luckily, Oswald escapes unscathed and runs off into the desert. Notes Oswald's theme song is featured for the first time in this film. The song was briefly shown again at the beginning of Alaska, the following cartoon.

She was a popular boat, providing summer cruises from Craigendoran until 1964. History PS Jeanie Deans was built for the London and North Eastern Railway in 1931 to compete with the CSP turbine steamer, . She was built by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Govan, as a paddler, rather than the more popular turbine steamer, allowing her a shallow draught to visit Craigendoran and Helensburgh. She took the name of an earlier fleet member, continuing the tradition of the North British Railway naming their vessels after characters from Sir Walter Scott's novels. =Jeanie Deans (1884)= An earlier Clyde steamer of the same name was built by Barclay Curle & Co in 1884 for the North British Steam Packet Co. She operated out of Craigendoran until 1896, when she was sold for service on Lough Foyle. Returning to the Clyde in 1899, as Duchess of York she ran cruises from Glasgow, becoming Isle of Cumbrae in 1904 and serving Rothesay. From 1916, she was chartered to the Glasgow and South Western Railway and operated between Princes Pier and Dunoon. She did not return to peacetime service and was broken up at Dumbarton in 1920. Layout Jeanie Deans was the first Clyde steamer with a three-crank engine, giving a speed of 18.5 knot in trials. As built, she had two small deckhouses, one forward, supporting the open bridge and one aft of the twin funnels, covering the companionway. After her first season, a large first class observation saloon was added forward on the promenade deck, providing welcome shelter during poor weather. The funnels were also lengthened to reduce the cinders deposited on passengers. After war service, she was extensively refitted, including a new deckhouse, increasing tonnage to 814. During the winter of 1956/7, she was converted from coal to oil burning and Radar was also installed a year later in 1960. Service Jeanie Deans was built for summer cruising from Craigendoran. In 1931, she took up the company's flagship Lochgoilhead and Arrochar service. On Sundays, she provided cruises down the Firth. These lower Firth cruises were extended from the 1932 season, visiting Ayr and offering cruises around Ailsa Craig and bringing her into direct contact with the Duchess of Hamilton. By the outbreak of war, she was the longest and fastest paddle steamer on the Firth. She was requisitioned by the government and saw war service as a minesweeper and then as an anti aircraft vessel on the River Thames. After being demobbed and returning to her peacetime duties, she launched the popular Round Bute cruise in the 1950s. Jeanie Deans was withdrawn after the 1964 season and sold for further cruising on the River Thames. As Queen of the South, she operated for the Coastal Steam Packet Company until 1967, but technical problems made the new venture a failure. In December 1967, she left the Thames for breaking up at Antwerp, Belgium. Legacy A clockwork model of the second Jeanie Deans is central to the plot of Down The Bright Stream by BB. The ship was memorialized by the Battlefield Band in the song \\"The Bonny Jeannie Deans\\" on their 2002 album Time and Tide.

The FSM may be a destination country for a few men and women from other Pacific nations who are subjected to conditions of forced labor. Micronesian sex trafficking victims from the state of Chuuk have been identified in Guam and the United States. In one case still before the courts in Guam, 10 young women from the state of Chuuk were lured to Guam by a Micronesian recruiter with promises of well-paying jobs in the service and hospitality sectors. Upon arrival in Guam, the women were forced to engage in prostitution. A physically and mentally disabled young woman from Chuuk was rescued from forced prostitution in Hawaii during the last year. Very little data on human trafficking in FSM is available as the government made no effort to proactively identify victims despite its history as a source country for victims. The government had not conducted any inquiries, investigations, studies, or surveys on human trafficking. The Government of the Federated States of Micronesia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, however it is making significant efforts to do so. In the last year, the government made no discernible efforts to proactively identify victims, prevent future trafficking incidents by educating the public about the dangers of trafficking, or investigate and prosecute suspected trafficking offenses; the Federated States of Micronesia is therefore placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year. The government did, however, provide some police and immigration officials with trafficking awareness training.\\"Micronesia, Federated States of\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). Prosecution The Government of the Federated States of Micronesia made no discernible progress in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The government did not take steps to investigate, prosecute or punish any suspected trafficking offenders during the reporting period. The FSM national police would have jurisdiction over transnational trafficking crimes, although no specific or comprehensive federal laws prohibit forms of human trafficking such as slavery, forced labor, or forced prostitution. Each of the four states could prosecute trafficking offenses under related laws. Penalties for trafficking offenses under these laws range from five to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment and are sufficiently stringent. Officials received no reports of trafficking cases during this reporting period. The Police Academy featured training on recognizing trafficking victims, as well as the difference between human trafficking and alien smuggling. The Academy also discussed trafficking interdiction techniques. No formal plan to act on the training is currently in place. A foreign government provided anti-trafficking training to the Transnational Crime Unit (TCU) as part of its overall support of the TCU‚Äôs activities. The TCU, part of the Pacific Transnational Crime network, remained the main conduit for general law enforcement information coming from international sources. Law enforcement agencies operated under significant resource, personnel, and capacity constraints. There was no evidence of official complicity in trafficking crimes, or of government involvement in or tolerance of trafficking on a local or institutional level. Protection During the reporting period, the government made no apparent efforts to proactively identify potential trafficking victims, and did not take steps to develop or implement formal or informal procedures to refer identified or suspected trafficking victims for appropriate services. During the year, FSM officials did not receive reports from other sources of any trafficking victims within the country‚Äôs borders, and did not, to their knowledge, provide services to any victims of trafficking. Identified or suspected trafficking victims would have access to the very limited social services and legal assistance provided by government agencies to any victim of crime. No NGOs knowingly provided services to any victims of trafficking crimes independently or in cooperation with the government. FSM has no laws specifically protecting trafficking victims or witnesses. While no specific civil remedy for trafficking victims is spelled out in the state or national codes, each state‚Äôs code does provide general redress for personal injuries caused by another. Victims may bring personal injury civil suits against traffickers, although no suits have ever been filed. The law did not provide specific legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they faced hardship or retribution. Judges, however, have the discretion to issue an order allowing any foreign victims of crime to remain in the country. Prevention The government made minimal efforts to prevent trafficking or increase the public‚Äôs awareness of trafficking risks in FSM and the region during the reporting period. Evidence and anecdotal reports suggest that the current number of internal or transnational trafficking victims is relatively low; the government‚Äôs limited resources were thus often directed to meet more emergent priorities. Immigration authorities claim to look for evidence of trafficking at ports of entry. Upper-level managers at the Division of Immigration and Labor attended seminars that discussed trafficking. The government did initiate anti-trafficking training for new police recruits in the last two police academy classes. In May 2009, the former FSM Ambassador to the United States was convicted of selling sample FSM passports maintained at the Embassy in Washington D.C. for personal financial gain, and sentenced to 30 months‚Äô imprisonment and a fine. Although authorities have not yet shown that the case clearly involved the transnational movement of trafficking victims, the former Ambassador was facilitating the illegal cross-border movement of irregular migrants from populations throughout the region that are consistently identified as trafficking victims. FSM supports no anti- trafficking task forces or working groups. The government conducted no campaigns aimed at reducing the demand for commercial sex acts. Micronesia is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Visa-free travel of Mongolians to Turkey has resulted in a significant increase in the number of both labor and sex trafficking cases of Mongolian labor migrants in Turkey. There remain concerns about involuntary child labor in the Mongolian construction, mining, and industrial sectors, where children are vulnerable to injury and face severe health hazards. The problem of Mongolian women subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude after engaging in brokered marriages ‚Äì mainly to South Korean men ‚Äì continues. Trafficking within Mongolia often involves women and girls forced to work in saunas or massage parlors where they are subjected to forced prostitution. Anecdotal reports continue to indicate that South Korean and Japanese tourists engage in child sex tourism in Mongolia. During the year, the first ever documented case of Mongolia as a destination country involved two Filipina women who became victims of involuntary domestic servitude in the homes of wealthy Mongolian families after responding to online advertisements for work. Many victims originally sought employment through fraudulent newspaper or television advertisements, and traffickers continue to use technology like ‚ÄúTV Chat‚Äù to lure victims. Many victims are recruited by acquaintances, friends, and family, and victims often have their travel documents confiscated. Around 250 North Koreans are employed in Mongolia as contract laborers ‚Äì an increase from 150 last year, despite concerns that North Korean workers overseas do not appear to be free to leave their employment, have their freedom of movement and communication restricted, and receive an unknown fraction of the money paid to the North Korean government for their work. The Government of Mongolia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government sustained partnerships with NGO's on anti-trafficking prevention measures. Nevertheless, the government did not demonstrate adequate efforts to proactively identify and protect victims of trafficking, leading to few victims coming forward to assist in the prosecution of their traffickers. The government's lack of adequate guidance on the use of the country's amended anti-trafficking article of law continues to cause courts to charge trafficking offenders under a lesser offense, resulting in shorter sentences. Corruption remains a key barrier to anti-trafficking progress.\\"Mongolia\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Sex trafficking Mongolian and foreign women and girls have been victims of sex trafficking in Mongolia. They have been raped and physically and psychologically harmed in brothels, homes, businesses, and other locations throughout the country, notably at the China‚ÄìMongolia border. Prosecution The Mongolian government continued its efforts to enforce anti-trafficking laws during the reporting period. Mongolia prohibits all forms of human trafficking through Article 113 of Mongolia's Criminal Code, which was amended in 2007 and which prescribes penalties that are sufficiently stringent ‚Äì up to 15 years' imprisonment ‚Äì and commensurate with those penalties prescribed for other serious offenses, such as rape. In spite of significant legal and technical assistance from foreign donors, Mongolia's Supreme Court has interpreted the amended Article 113 in a way that has created ambiguities as to when prosecutors and judges should apply the law. This interpretation by the country's highest court, which notes that individuals who know they are being transported for sex work cannot be classified as trafficking victims under Article 113, is in violation of the 2000 UN TIP Protocol, which Mongolia has ratified. The Supreme Court's interpretation continues to confuse judicial officials, causing trafficking offenders to be prosecuted under the lesser offense of forced prostitution (Article 124). The government prosecuted 11 individuals in four trafficking cases under Article 113, and secured convictions of nine trafficking offenders, all of whom were sex trafficking offenders, compared with 11 convictions in the previous reporting period. The government has never prosecuted an offender of labor trafficking, and the Supreme Court's narrow interpretation of Article 113 serves as an impediment to the prosecution of labor trafficking cases in Mongolia. Those convicted under Article 113 received sentences of six to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment. An additional five sex trafficking offenders were convicted under Article 124, two of whom were sentenced to one year's imprisonment; the remaining three have not yet been sentenced. In September 2009, due to the misclassification of a trafficking case that was prosecuted under Article 124 instead of Article 113, the government granted amnesty to a trafficker who was convicted of raping and forcing a girl into prostitution. As a result, the offender did not serve any time in prison. In October 2009, Mongolian courts ordered trafficking offenders to compensate five victims trafficked to Macau $3,000 each, in addition to significant imposed jail sentences; this decision is under appeal. According to Mongolian law, criminal cases are only initiated upon a victim's complaint, and victims are required to assist in the prosecution of their traffickers. This requirement, along with the lack of victim and witness protection mechanisms in Mongolia, causes many victims to refuse to report to police instances of trafficking out of fear of retribution from their traffickers, and restricts their ability to obtain restitution from courts. Corruption among law enforcement personnel remains a significant problem in Mongolia and a barrier to anti-trafficking progress, though the government has never investigated or taken disciplinary actions against law enforcement officers involved in trafficking-related corruption. In November 2009, police authorities of the border town Zamyn-Uud signed a memorandum of understanding with counterparts in the adjacent Chinese border town of Erlian covering cooperation against human trafficking. Protection During the reporting period, the government referred 18 victims to an NGO shelter, run by the Mongolian Gender Equality Center. The NGO reported assisting these victims, and identifying and assisting an additional 61 victims not identified by the government, most of whom were referred from friends and family members of victims. The government did not demonstrate use of systematic procedures to proactively identify victims of trafficking among vulnerable groups, such as women detained for involvement in prostitution, or migrant laborers returning from abroad, and did not maintain statistics on the number of trafficking victims identified by authorities. The government did not provide specialized training to officials on victim identification. Victims were sometimes punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked, such as being prosecuted on prostitution charges. Officials did not refer trafficking victims to appropriate services. The government did not run any shelters for victims of trafficking, nor did it provide direct assistance to Mongolian trafficking victims repatriated from other countries or foreign victims of trafficking identified in Mongolia. The government provided $10,000 to the National Center Against Violence, which primarily sheltered domestic violence victims but also sometimes shelters trafficking victims. The government provided one NGO with $3,000 to counsel and assist children vulnerable to trafficking. Although the government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders, Mongolian law continued to lack protection provisions for victims who served as prosecution witnesses, which put victims in great danger. The Mongolian government provided legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face retribution or hardship. Prevention The Government of Mongolia continued modest trafficking prevention activities through partnerships with NGOs, international organizations, and foreign donors. Officials continued the distribution of NGO-sponsored passport and train ticket inserts on the dangers of trafficking and resources available for victims to some Mongolians traveling abroad. With NGO funding, the government cooperated on the production of public service announcements to raise public awareness about trafficking, and broadcast them on television channels. During the reporting period, Mongolia forged partnerships with Kazakhstan and the OSCE to host an international workshop on trafficking. The government did not take any measures during the reporting period to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. Mongolian troops were briefed on the criminal nature of solicitation of prostitution, but did not receive training specific to human trafficking.

Trafficking victims are mostly females from Ukraine, Moldova, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Montenegro, who migrate or are smuggled through the country en route to other destinations and subjected to conditions of forced prostitution in Montenegro. Roma children are coerced into organized street begging in the country. According to NGOs and international experts, mainly foreign men and boys are subjected to forced labor in Montenegro's growing construction industry. Montenegrin women and girls are subjected to forced prostitution within the country and in other Balkan countries; anecdotal reports indicate at least one Montenegrin girl was subjected to conditions of forced prostitution in Serbia during the reporting period. Anecdotal reports in 2009 also indicated some women and girls from Serbia and other countries in this region are subjected to conditions of forced prostitution in Montenegro. Criminal networks operating in Montenegro's expanding tourism industry are reportedly engaged in trafficking for the purpose forced prostitution. According to the Human Rights Commissioner for the Council of Europe, several sources question the Montenegrin government's official stance that Montenegro does not have a considerable trafficking problem. Reports state that there is a rampant problem of prostitution of Montenegrin girls in central and south Montenegro, where many of the clients are Albanians. The Government of Montenegro does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Montenegro made some important progress during the reporting period and, for the first time, publicly acknowledged a trafficking problem in Montenegro. During 2009, the government improved the referral of some potential victims to providers of victim assistance, took initial steps to address trafficking-related complicity, and implemented anti- trafficking prevention programs aimed at vulnerable populations in Montenegro. However, NGOs and international organizations continued to report insufficient capacity among relevant government agencies to identify potential trafficking victims. Moreover, trafficking-related complicity impeded the government's ability to genuinely tackle its trafficking problem. Despite conducting numerous labor inspections of construction sites throughout the year, the government did not identify any suspected victims of forced labor in the construction sector during the year.\\"Montenegro\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Montenegro demonstrated some improvement in its law enforcement response to human trafficking in 2009. Montenegro prohibits sex and labor trafficking through Article 444 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties of up to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment ‚Äì penalties that are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for rape. In 2009, the government investigated and prosecuted 14 trafficking suspects and convicted 11 trafficking offenders; courts acquitted three persons. Sentences imposed on the 11 convicted offenders ranged from one to five years in prison. According to the government, five convicted traffickers were actually serving their sentences at the time of this report. Under Montenegrin law, some convicted offenders, including traffickers, were entitled to four weekend furloughs a year, if they met certain conditions and have completed two-thirds of their jail time. During the reporting period, the government arrested and initiated prosecutions of 10 adults for organizing and forcing their own relatives, young Roma children, to beg. The government, through its anti-trafficking National Coordinator, established a mechanism to greatly improve the government's ability to provide information on its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts in 2009. According to a Council of Europe's 2009 Report, corruption involving low-level law enforcement and customs officials hampered the government's anti-trafficking efforts, particularly with officers working overtime providing security in bars and nightclubs. Notably, in February 2010, law enforcement officers arrested three policemen working as guards in night clubs in Podgorica and Ulcinj for their suspected involvement in the forced prostitution of girls. The government, however, subsequently charged these officers for abuse of authority. The government continued to mandate that all police trainees receive anti-trafficking training at an academy in Danilovgrad and continued to ensure one officer in each police station in Montenegro to handle trafficking cases. Throughout the year, the National Coordinator's office organized and funded anti-trafficking training of law enforcement personnel, members of the judiciary, and other stakeholders; through partnerships with the government, anti-trafficking NGOs provided government officials with specific training on the identification of trafficking victims and sensitive questioning techniques. Protection The Government of Montenegro made important progress in protecting trafficking victims in 2009. NGOs continued to report, however, that the government's implementation of victim identification procedures remained inadequate. The government funded a trafficking victim shelter during the reporting period, providing approximately $109,200 to cover the costs of the NGOs' provision of psychological care, legal aid, and vocational training to trafficking victims. The government improved its implementation of a formal victim referral mechanism, evident in its referral of an increased number of potential sex trafficking victims for care in 2009 ‚Äì 13, compared with only two referred in 2008. Police also referred a higher number of Roma children subjected to conditions of forced begging in 2009. The government provided temporary care and shelter for most of these rescued children in the Center for Children and Youth. However, many of the suspected traffickers were believed to be the victim's relatives; 76 of these victims were returned to their places of residence in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Local police misunderstanding of trafficking continued to be an impediment to proper victim identification; one international expert reported that police sometimes accused trafficking victims of being mentally disturbed. During 2009, Montenegrin authorities conducted 13,518 labor inspections of construction sites and found 8,320 violations of labor standards, though there were no suspected victims of forced labor identified as a result of these inspections. The government encouraged victims to participate in the investigations or prosecutions of trafficking offenders, though in practice, few victims cooperated with authorities beyond giving statements to the police due to fear of reprisals. NGOs reported that victims often changed their initial statements to police out of fear. The government reported that it ensured that trafficking victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. The government reported it offered potential trafficking victims temporary residency status in Montenegro; however none of the potential trafficking victims chose to apply for this status in 2009. Prevention The Montenegrin government intensified its efforts in the prevention of human trafficking during the year, and for the first time, it acknowledged a human trafficking problem in Montenegro. During the reporting period, the government continued to fund various public awareness campaigns in partnership with international organizations to educate potential victims about trafficking. This included organizing round table discussions, anti- trafficking workshops, and poster and hotline advertisements; holding classes in schools; distributing anti-trafficking brochures and passport inserts; posting anti-trafficking billboards; and producing and broadcasting a trafficking documentary. Further, the government updated its website to increase anti-trafficking information provided to the public. In October 2009, the government, in partnership with an NGO forum, conducted training on recognizing trafficked children in an orphanage in Bijela and among Roma children in the Konik refugee camp in Podgorica. In February 2010, the national anti-trafficking Office of TIP Coordinator, in coordination with OSCE organized a regional conference of national coordinators in the Balkans.

Children are trafficked within the country from rural areas to urban centers to work as maids or laborers, or for commercial sexual exploitation. Moroccan men, women, and children are exploited for forced labor and prostitution in European and Middle Eastern countries. Young Moroccan girls from rural areas are recruited to work as child maids in cities, but often experience non-payment of wages, threats, and physical or sexual abuse, and sometimes face restrictions on movement. These practices indicate that these girls are subjected to involuntary servitude. Moroccan boys experience forced labor as apprentices in the artisan and construction industries and in mechanic shops. A few Moroccan men and boys are lured to Europe by fraudulent job offers, and are subsequently forced to sell drugs. In addition, men and women from sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Philippines enter Morocco voluntarily but illegally with the assistance of smugglers; once in Morocco, some of the women are coerced into prostitution or, less frequently, forced into domestic service. Nigerian gangs, who engage in a variety of criminal activities like human smuggling and drug trafficking, compete to control the trafficking of sub-Saharan Africans in Morocco. The Government of Morocco does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government convicted one person who subjected a 13-year-old child domestic worker to forced labor, though it continued to lack overall progress in the following areas: convicting and punishing trafficking offenders with punishments commensurate with the heinous nature of the offense; proactively identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable groups; and ensuring that foreign trafficking victims are not subject to arrest and deportation. The government also continues to conflate migrant smuggling and human trafficking.\\"Morocco\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Morocco made progress in investigating trafficking offenses and punishing trafficking offenders during the reporting period. Moroccan law appears to prohibit all forms of trafficking. Its Penal Code prohibits forced child labor through Article 467, forced labor through Article 10, and forced prostitution and prostitution of a minor through Articles 497-499. The Government of Morocco reports that it also employs the Immigration Law of 2003 and other statutes, such as those prohibiting kidnapping, fraud, and coercion, to prosecute trafficking offenses; however, it has not provided any information on cases tried under these laws. Penalties prescribed by these various statutes for sex trafficking offenses are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. In contrast, penalties prescribed for labor trafficking offenses appear not to be sufficiently stringent; penalties for child labor under Article 467 range from one to three years' imprisonment, while general penalties for forced labor under Article 10 are limited to fines for first-time offenders or six days' to three months' imprisonment for repeat offenders. The government took criminal action against at least one high-profile case of physical or sexual abuse of child domestic workers. In October 2009, a court convicted the wife of a judge who subjected a child domestic worker to forced labor; she was convicted of intentional assault and battery on a child under the age of 15, as well as the use of a weapon with malicious intent, and sentenced to three and a half years' imprisonment. The Ministry of Justice reported that it prosecuted 138 individuals for exploitation of a child for begging and 203 individuals for facilitating the prostitution of a child for the most recent year in which data was available; it is unclear how many, if any, of these prosecutions involved human trafficking offenses. Their sentences ranged from one month to two years' imprisonment. The government reported that it broke up 130 trafficking or smuggling rings in 2009. However, the government made no distinction between migrant smuggling and trafficking, so it was unclear how many, if any, were truly human trafficking rings. Protection Morocco made limited progress in protecting victims of trafficking over the last year. Foreign trafficking victims are often treated as undocumented migrants, subject to arrest and deportation. Government officials continued to detain and deport large numbers of undocumented sub-Saharan migrants without taking adequate steps to identify trafficking victims among them. These detained migrants, some of whom may have been trafficking victims, were usually left at the Algerian border, often without food or water. There were reports that some were robbed, assaulted, and sexually abused by criminal gangs that operate in the area. The government did not offer legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims of trafficking to countries where they might face retribution or hardship. Morocco does not encourage victims to participate in investigations against their traffickers. Some victims reportedly testified but were subsequently deported. Sub-Saharan African women who are forced into prostitution in Morocco were not likely to report crimes for fear of being deported. NGOs provided most services to domestic victims of trafficking. Undocumented migrants ‚Äì some of whom may have been trafficking victims ‚Äì reportedly suffered physical abuse at the hands of Moroccan police. Government-operated Child Protection Units in Casablanca and Marrakesh offered assistance to street children and other victims of violence, abuse, and sexual exploitation, possibly including victims of trafficking. The government also operated a hotline that referred women and children who are victims of violence and sexual assault to women's groups for possible assistance. It is uncertain if any trafficking victims were identified or protected through the hotline in the reporting period. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Moroccan diplomatic missions provided assistance to Moroccans who were trafficked abroad. Prevention The Moroccan government made some efforts in preventing human trafficking over the last year. The government included anti- human trafficking modules in training programs for the Royal Gendarmerie, the Auxiliary Forces, and the police. In April 2009, the Ministry of Justice conducted an awareness raising course for magistrates about victim protection and working with trafficking victims who have been affected by violence or sexual exploitation. The government's labor inspectors, who were appointed as child labor focal points in each of the 45 inspector offices, received training from an international organization during the year. Authorities did not raise public awareness of the commercial sexual exploitation of children and women and did not take any reported measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. The Moroccan government provided birth certificates for all nationals, including children in isolated rural areas, and issued national identity cards for all citizens on their 18th birthday. All Moroccan soldiers participating in UN peacekeeping missions receive training on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation. The Moroccan government cooperated with the IOM in preparing a publicly available report that included a comprehensive overview of the government's strengths and weaknesses on trafficking issues and included recommendations for legislative and policy reforms. Morocco is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

The use of forced and bonded child laborers is common in rural areas of the country, often with the complicity of family members. Women and girls from these rural areas are also lured to cities with promises of employment or education, as well as to South Africa for involuntary domestic servitude and forced prostitution. NGO's report that Mozambican victims of sex traffickers were taken by traffickers to \\"training centers\\" in Swaziland and South Africa in preparation for an expected increase in demand for prostitution during the 2010 World Cup. Young Mozambican men and boys are subjected to conditions of forced labor in South African farms and mines; they often labor for months in South Africa without pay and under coercive conditions before being turned over to police for deportation as illegal migrants. Mozambican adults are subjected to forced labor and forced prostitution in Portugal. Women and girls from Rhodesia and Malawi who voluntarily migrate to Mozambique continue to be manipulated by traffickers into forced prostitution and domestic servitude subsequent to their arrival. There are an estimated 145,600 people living in slavery in Mozambique and countless more being taken unwillingly into South Africa. Traffickers are typically part of loose, informal networks of Mozambican or South African citizens; however, larger Chinese and reportedly Nigerian trafficking syndicates are also active in Mozambique. Human traffickers' internal and cross-border routes are also used to smuggle illicit drugs; often, the same facilitators transport both drugs and trafficked victims. In addition, South Asian smugglers who move South Asian undocumented migrants throughout Africa reportedly also transport trafficking victims through Mozambique. Internal and transnational trafficking in persons for the purposes of forcible organ removal to support an offshoot of the traditional healing industry in South Africa and Mozambique is significant. Witch doctors in Mozambique and other countries forcibly remove various body parts from children and adults, either while the victims are still alive or immediately following violent death, for use in \\"traditional\\" medical concoctions intended to heal illness, foster economic advancement, or hurt enemies. The Government of Mozambique does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, including work on the development of implementing regulations for its new anti-trafficking law, the government did not show evidence of increasing efforts to address human trafficking, particularly efforts to prosecute or convict trafficking offenders as it has done in the past, or to investigate continuing reports of government officials' complicity in trafficking crimes.\\"Mozambique\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017.  Women's Issues  There is both an expectation for women to get married and to get married young so they are no longer a burden to their family financially. Women who remain unmarried are more at risk to be trafficked because of their limited economic opportunities (Britton). Traditional Mozambican societies do not operate in favor of single women and this is what forces them to seek out other ways to make a living. It is reported that ‚Äúglobal colonialism and imperialism reflect a series of unequal power relations and hierarchical power structures in which poor girls and women in general, and poor girls and women of color in particular, are located at the bottom of global power structures‚Äù (Gale). This is very true in Mozambique and women make up the majority of people that are trafficked into South Africa. Women with black, brown, and gold skin tones are most at risk because they are seen as ‚Äúexotic‚Äù which makes them desirable to others in the global sex trade (Gale). In more traditional and rural areas of Mozambique, jobs can be denied to women based on their status, family name, and cultural background. In many situations women of a lower class are limited in the jobs that they are able to secure, leaving them with little money to buy essentials and take care of their families. In Mozambique, ‚ÄúPoverty distribution is heavily gendered, with female-headed households as most vulnerable group‚Äù (Women‚Äôs Age Indicator). Poverty, in many cases, is a pipeline to human trafficking and women living in poverty are more exposed to this because they are likely to look for different forms of work to support themselves. Women desperate to find husbands are more likely to be lured by false pretenses, and women who do not get married by a certain age may be driven to find alternate forms of work putting them at risk for be trafficked. Prosecution In September 2008, the government enacted a new comprehensive human trafficking law. The law prescribes penalties of 16 to 20 years' imprisonment for those recruiting or facilitating the exploitation of a person for purposes of prostitution, forced labor, slavery, or involuntary debt servitude; these penalties are sufficiently stringent and exceed those for other serious crimes. During 2009, the government again budgeted $360,000 to support enforcement of the law and for a second year did not allocate this funding to any government entity. Implementing regulations for the law have not been issued; without these regulations, the police were not generally in a position to arrest suspected trafficking offenders and conduct an investigation that could successfully support a court case. The government formed partnerships with NGO's to provide anti-trafficking seminars for new police officers throughout the country. Police reported arresting trafficking offenders and breaking up several trafficking schemes during the year, including the arrest of at least one suspected trafficking ringleader. In January 2010, police arrested a man in Beira for allegedly running a criminal ring involved in the sale of hard drugs and in sex trafficking. The media reported that the suspect had at least one police officer on her payroll. In March 2010, police arrested eight traffickers after being alerted by undercover journalists that the traffickers had offered to \\"sell\\" them several girls and women. Within weeks, all of the suspects were released on bail. Traffickers commonly bribed law enforcement officials to allow their movement of trafficking victims internally and across national borders into South Africa and Swaziland, sometimes without passports. There is no evidence of widespread government involvement in or tolerance of trafficking; however, there are known cases of government officials facilitating human trafficking. No officials have been investigated, detained, or prosecuted for complicity in trafficking crimes. For the first time, police began to keep statistics on trafficking victims; this data was not available at the time of publication. Protection The Mozambican government suffers from limited resources and a lack of political commitment regarding human trafficking. Funding for victims' assistance remained rudimentary, and government officials regularly relied on NGOs to provide shelter, counseling, food, and rehabilitation. The government continued to lack formalized procedures for identifying potential victims of trafficking and referring them to organizations providing protective services. The Office of Assistance to Women and Vulnerable Children continued its partnership with a network of anti-trafficking NGOs to respond quickly to tips on potential trafficking cases and provide care and protection to victims. UNICEF helped police establish the first-ever police station specifically designed to assist women and children, including trafficking victims, in Maputo. A dedicated toll-free number, \\"116,\\" became fully operational in November 2009, allowing persons to report crimes against children, including trafficking. Line \\"116\\" received 5,239 calls from November through December 2009, though it is not known how many of these were related to human trafficking. An NGO managed the country's only permanent shelter for child trafficking victims, which operated on land donated by the Moamba District government. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers and did not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. The government did not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they would face hardship or retribution. = Sex Trafficking Protections = The establishment of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized crime in 2000 is one of the policies being implemented by officials in order to combat human trafficking. Promoting women's empowerment is a way that the African Union and Southern African Development Community have chose to fight human trafficking. It has proved to be hard for the government to prosecute crimes related to sex trafficking and provide support for victims. Government funding, community cooperation, and acceptance of the issue are part of what makes sex trafficking in Mozambique difficult to combat. The government does have action plans in place, but they are almost never followed through. Last year, ‚Äúthe government maintained inadequate protection efforts... and offered limited shelter, medical, and psychological assistance.‚Äù (U.S. Department of State). Information reported to police is often not followed up on making it hard for the government to help those in need. Other public health related issues in the country often take priority to combating human trafficking does not always take priority in terms of funding. At risk groups have been identified by outside support systems, yet, ‚ÄúMaputo has ‚Äòfailed to identify or protect victims during the last year, and funds for the fight were not used in the best manner‚Äô‚Äù(VOA). The government has not taken combating this issue a seriously they could and most of the money that goes towards to combating trafficking come from NGOs which can be taken away at any time. Prevention The government's prevention efforts remained weak during the reporting period. The government did not launch a nationwide campaign to foster awareness of trafficking among government officials and private citizens. As a result, most Mozambicans, including many law enforcement officials, reportedly lacked a clear understanding of what constitutes trafficking. Officials met regularly with the Anti-Trafficking Forum, which provided a mechanism through which the government and its NGO partners could discuss trafficking issues and coordinate their anti-trafficking activities. Most anti-trafficking educational workshops were run by NGOs with some government participation. Media coverage of trafficking cases or issues significantly diminished over the past year, although a sting operation which led to the arrest of eight Mozambican and Chinese sex traffickers in March 2010 was featured prominently in the news. Law enforcement officials and partner NGOs monitored major border crossings and immigration patterns for indications of potential trafficking victims, but these officials remained prone to complicity with traffickers. The Ministry of Justice worked with a network of NGOs to develop an anti- trafficking strategy for the 2010 World Cup, which may increase the incidence of trafficked Mozambicans transported to South Africa for commercial sexual exploitation, but implementation was poor. The government did not take any significant measures to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts during the year.  Cultural Values  Traditional Mozambican values foster acceptance and trustworthiness of men which plays to the advantage of many traffickers. Women specifically are taught to trust men because in Mozambique, ‚ÄúSexuality is often perceived as a site for women‚Äôs subordination‚Äù (Arnfred). Marriage is an institution that gifts a woman's sexuality to her husband, and can impede her advancement in Mozambican society (Arnfred). Women are taught to rely on men which can put them in vulnerable situations when it comes to trafficking. A popular African proverb says,‚ÄúIf you want to go fast go alone. If you want to go far go together‚Äù (Tu) and this is what people abide by in Mozambique. The idea that collectivism is the key to success is prominent in the minds of many Mozambicans living in traditional communities. People often trust that those around them have their best interest in mind and with the rocketing number of human trafficking cases of people being kidnapped from Mozambique to be sold in South Africa that is not always the case. Louisa, a girl that was kidnapped from her rural village, talked about her journey in an interview with Deutsche Welle News and how she ended up in that situation. Louisa was walking home when she encountered a man who offered her work at his house to clean for him. When she got there he threatened her and took her to South Africa with no documentation. At the end of the interview her mother then said, ‚ÄúAt fifteen my daughter had never encountered a person in our village who didn‚Äôt tell her the truth‚Äù (DW News).

Brazil is a source country for men, women, girls, and boys subjected to human trafficking, specifically forced prostitution within the country and abroad, as well as a source country for men and boys in forced labor within the country. In 2012 there was a soap opera made about Human trafficking named Salve Jorge. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017.  Sex trafficking  According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, sex trafficking of Brazilian women occurs in every Brazilian state and the federal district. A large number of Brazilian women and children, many from the state of Goi√°s, are found in forced prostitution abroad, often in Spain, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the United States, but also as far away as Japan. Brazilian authorities have uncovered evidence that foreign organized criminal networks, particularly from Russia and Spain, are involved in sex trafficking of Brazilian women. There is evidence that some Brazilian transsexuals have been subjected to forced prostitution abroad. Brazilian women and children are also subjected to forced prostitution in neighboring countries such as Argentina, Suriname, French Guiana, Venezuela, and Paraguay. To a lesser extent, women from neighboring countries have been identified in sexual servitude in Brazil.  Slave labor  Under Brazilian law, the term \\"trabalho escravo\\", or slave labor, can signify forced labor or labor performed during exhausting work days or in degrading working conditions. More than 25,000 Brazilian men are subjected to slave labor within the country, typically on cattle ranches, logging and mining camps, sugar-cane plantations, and large farms producing corn, cotton, soy, and charcoal. Some boys have been identified as slave laborers in cattle ranching, mining, and the production of charcoal. Forced labor victims are commonly lured with promises of good pay by local recruiters ‚Äì known as \\"gatos\\" ‚Äì in rural northeastern states to interior locations where many victims are subjected to debt bondage. Most internally trafficked forced laborers originated from the states of Maranh√£o and Piau√≠, while Par√° and Mato Grosso states received the higher number of internally trafficked slave laborers. Labor trafficking victims are also found in the Cerrado, the Atlantic Forest, and the Pantanal. Children in involuntary domestic servitude, particularly involving teenage girls, also constitute a problem in the country. A recent U.S. Department of Labor study showed that Brazil still employs children mostly in the agricultural sector, as well as the mining and textile industries with a total of 16 products.List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor  Brazil as a destination  To a lesser extent, Brazil is a destination for the trafficking of men, women, and children from Bolivia, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Paraguay, China and African countries for forced labor in garment factories and textile sweatshops in metropolitan centers such as S√£o Paulo. African, Arab and Bangladeshi migrants forced to work in the halal chicken factories in the Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. Child sex tourism remains a serious problem, particularly in resort and coastal areas in Brazil's northeast. Child sex tourists typically arrive from Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States.\\"Brazil\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). Prosecution The Brazilian government maintained law enforcement efforts to confront human trafficking crimes during the past year. Brazilian laws prohibit most forms of trafficking in persons. Law 12.015, which entered into effect in August 2009, amended Sections 231 and 231-A of the Brazilian penal code to strengthen penalties against potential sex trafficking offenders. Sections 231 and 231-A prohibit promoting or facilitating movement to, from, or within the country for the purposes of prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation, prescribing penalties of three to eight years‚Äô imprisonment. Sentences may be increased up to 12 years when violence, threats, or fraud are used, or if the victim is a child. The above penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. These statutes encompass activity that does not constitute trafficking, however, such as consensual smuggling or movement for the purpose of prostitution. =Slave labor= Labor trafficking is criminalized pursuant to Section 149 of the penal code, which prohibits \\"trabalho escravo\\", or reducing a person to a condition analogous to slavery, including by forcing a person to work or by subjecting a person to exhausting work days or degrading working conditions. This statute, therefore, prohibits treatment that is considered human trafficking, such as forced labor, as well as other treatment, such as poor labor conditions, which is beyond the definition of human trafficking. The penalty of two to eight years‚Äô imprisonment is sufficiently stringent. However, Brazilian law may not adequately criminalize other means of non-physical coercion or fraud used to subject workers to forced labor, such as threatening foreign migrants with deportation unless they continued to work. A 2006 presidential decree included a stated goal to amend Brazilian anti-trafficking laws to achieve parity between penalties applied to sex trafficking and slave labor crimes; , such amendments remained unrealized. A bill first proposed in 2001 which would allow the government to confiscate and redistribute property on which forced labor has been employed is still pending. The government maintained efforts to investigate forced labor crimes. During the reporting period, the government prosecuted and convicted 15 persons under the \\"trabalho escravo\\" law. The 15 convicted offenders were given sentences ranging from 30 months to 10 years and six months plus fines, compared with 23 convictions for trabalho escravo during the previous year. Convicted trafficking offenders had subjected workers to slave labor on a rice and soy plantation, a palm-oil plantation, and cattle ranches. The Ministry of Labor‚Äôs anti-slave labor mobile unit, created in 1995, increased the number of rescue operations conducted last year; the unit‚Äôs labor inspectors continued to free victims, and require those responsible to pay approximately $3.3 million in fines. In the past, mobile unit inspectors did not typically seize physical evidence or attempt to interview witnesses with the goal of developing a criminal investigation or prosecution; labor inspectors and labor prosecutors can only apply civil penalties, and their anti-trafficking efforts were not always coordinated with public ministry prosecutors, who initiate criminal cases in federal court. In addition to weak coordination among the police, judiciary, and prosecutors, local political pressure and the remoteness of areas in which slave labor was practiced were cited as impediments in criminal prosecution of slave labor offenders. =Sex trafficking= In 2010, five sex trafficking offenders were convicted in one case involving Brazilian women trafficked to Switzerland, with sentences ranging from one to six years‚Äô imprisonment. Such results represent a decrease in convictions when compared with 22 sex trafficking convictions achieved during the previous reporting period. There were no reports of convictions for internal sex trafficking, although several individuals were arrested for this crime. Authorities collaborated with foreign governments in a number of transnational trafficking cases involving victims trafficked to Italy, Spain, Portugal, Canada, Switzerland, Mexico, Argentina, and the United States. An integrated sex trafficking database which will collect information from law enforcement, the judiciary branch, and anti- trafficking centers around the country remained in the testing stage. = Official complicity = Credible NGO reporting indicated serious official complicity in trafficking crimes at the local level, alleging that police turned a blind eye to child prostitution and potential human trafficking activity in commercial sex sites. In the past, reporting indicates that state police officials were involved in the killing or intimidation of witnesses involved in testifying against police officials in labor exploitation or slave labor hearings, and a few Brazilian legislators have sought to interfere with the operation of the labor inspection teams. Five federal police officers and two federal police administrators were arrested for alleged involvement in trafficking Chinese workers to S√£o Paulo to work in the garment industry, and one federal judge was charged with trafficking Brazilian women to Portugal for sexual exploitation. Authorities provided specialized anti-trafficking training to law enforcement officers. Protection The Brazilian government sustained efforts to provide trafficking victims with services during the year. Authorities continued to use mobile inspection teams to identify forced laborers, but did not report formal procedures for identifying trafficking victims among other vulnerable populations, such as women in prostitution. The Ministry of Social Development provided generalized shelter, counseling, and medical aid to women and girls who were victims of sex trafficking through its network of 400 centers for victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse. In 2010 the government established a women's center for victims of violence, including human trafficking, via an agreement of partnership with the Paraguayan and Argentine governments in a general migrant's assistance center in the tri-border area. Brazilian police continued to refer child sex trafficking victims to government-run Service to Combat Violence, Abuse, and Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents for care. While the government reported training workers at more than 600 centers and health care facilities around the country to assist trafficking victims, NGOs noted that many centers were not prepared to handle trafficking cases and were underfunded. NGOs provided additional victim services, sometimes with limited government funding, and long-term shelter options were generally unavailable. The Brazilian government, with assistance from UNODC, continued to fund regional anti-trafficking offices in conjunction with state governments in S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Goi√°s, Pernambuco, Cear√°, and Par√° and opened two new offices in Acre and Bahia. These offices are responsible for providing victim assistance, in addition to preventing and combating human trafficking, although NGOs report that quality of service varies and that some centers focus on public awareness as opposed to victim care. Authorities also operated an assistance post to aid repatriated citizens who might be trafficking victims in the airport in Belem. In early 2010, the government took over responsibility for an assistance post in the S√£o Paulo airport previously run by an NGO. During 2009, the post assisted 444 individuals, nine of which were identified as trafficking victims. Authorities plan to create additional airport posts in Fortaleza, Salvador, and Rio de Janeiro in 2010. = Slave labor = During the year, the Ministry of Labor's mobile units identified and freed 3,769 victims of slave labor through 156 operations targeting 350 properties. Such results compare with 5,016 victims freed through 154 operations targeting 290 properties in 2008. The Ministry of Labor awarded forced labor victims a portion of funds which were derived from fines levied against the landowners or employers identified during the operations. However, forced labor victims, typically adult Brazilian men, were not eligible for government-provided shelter assistance, though they were provided with three months‚Äô salary at minimum wage, as well as job training and travel assistance when available. The government did not generally encourage victims of slave labor to participate in criminal investigations or prosecutions. Some NGOs provided such victim services to male victims. According to NGOs, some rescued slave laborers have been re-trafficked, due to lack of effective prosecutions of recruiters of trabalho escravo, few alternate forms of employment for the rescued workers, and lack of legal aid to help them pursue their own complaints against exploitative employers. = Sex trafficking = The government encouraged sex trafficking victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions of trafficking, though victims often were reluctant to testify due to fear of reprisals from traffickers and corrupt law enforcement officials. NGOs allege that police often dismissed cases involving sex trafficking victims, and some victims reported discrimination or prejudicial treatment due to the fact that they worked in prostitution prior to being trafficked and were therefore not considered victims. Some victims of sex trafficking were offered short-term protection under a witness protection program active in 10 states, which was generally regarded as lacking resources. The government did not detain, fine, or otherwise penalize identified victims of trafficking for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. However, the government does not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution, and law enforcement personnel noted that undocumented foreign victims were often deported before they could assist with prosecutions against their traffickers. Brazilian consular officers received guidance on how to report trafficking cases and assist trafficking victims. Prevention The Brazilian government increased efforts to prevent human trafficking in recent years. Federal authorities generally maintained cooperation with international organizations and NGOs on anti-trafficking activities. Various government agencies implemented parts of the 2008-2010 National Plan for Combating Trafficking in Persons. Civil society organizations, religious officials, and various government agencies collaborated on anti-trafficking initiatives. A national hotline for reporting incidents of child sexual abuse and exploitation received approximately 12,000 calls on sexual exploitation of children, including a total of 200 reported calls on child trafficking. Articles 206 and 207 of Brazil's penal code prohibit the trafficking-related offense of fraudulent recruitment or enticement of workers, internally or internationally, prescribing penalties of one to three years‚Äô imprisonment. The Ministry of Labor's ‚Äúdirty list,‚Äù which publicly identifies individuals and corporate entities the government has determined to have been responsible for crimes under the trabalho escravo law, continued to provide civil penalties to those engaged in this serious crime. The most recent version, released in January 2010, cited 164 employers, some of whom, because of this designation, were denied access to credit by public and private financial institutions because of this designation. During the year, however, a number of individuals and corporate entities were able to avoid opprobrium by suing to remove their names from the ‚Äúdirty list‚Äù or reincorporating under a different name. The government took measures to reduce demand for commercial sexual exploitation of children by conducting a multi- media campaign during the 2010 Carnaval holiday period, reaching an estimated audience of 600,000,000. Action brigades distributed a wide variety of awareness materials, radio announcements were broadcast daily, and airlines made information available on their flights. The government also sought to reduce demand for commercial sex acts along Brazil's highways. In partnership with a Brazilian energy company and an international organization, authorities trained highway police and engaged truck drivers in the fight against the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Finally, Brazilian authorities relied on operational partnerships with foreign governments to extradite and prosecute foreign sex tourists, though there were no reports of prosecutions or convictions for child sex tourism within Brazil. The Brazilian military used the United Nations Peacekeeping Office‚Äôs anti-trafficking and forced labor training modules to train its troops prior to their deployment abroad as part of international peacekeeping missions.

Brunei is a transit country for trafficking victims in Malaysia, including Filipinas, who are brought to Brunei for work permit re-authorization before being returned to Malaysia. The Government of Brunei does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. While the government has laws to prosecute trafficking, it has never prosecuted a trafficking case. The government did not proactively identify any trafficking victims during 2010, nor did it develop or implement formal procedures to identify victims of trafficking.\\"Brunei\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Sex trafficking Citizen and foreign women and girls are sex trafficked in Brunei. They are raped and physically and psychologically harmed throughout the country. Prosecution The government made no discernible anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during 2010. The Government of Brunei prohibits sex and labor trafficking through its Trafficking and Smuggling Persons Order of 2004; however, there has never been a prosecution or conviction under this order. The 2004 Order prescribes punishments of up to 30 years‚Äô imprisonment, which is sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses. Bruneian authorities did not investigate or prosecute any trafficking cases during the reporting period. The Department of Labor investigated labor disputes from foreign workers, including job switching, salary deductions for recruitment fees, salary based on false promises, and high recruitment fees paid by the prospective employee, although it did not identify any instances of trafficking among these cases. Labor disputes by foreign workers are usually tried under the Labor Act, which carries administrative penalties. Although government regulations prohibit wage deductions by agencies or sponsors and mandate that employees receive their full salaries, some foreign workers continued to pay high fees to overseas recruitment agents to obtain work in Brunei, leaving them vulnerable to debt bondage. Authorities continue to rely on victims coming forward or being identified by foreign embassies, and do not proactively identify trafficking cases among vulnerable groups. During the reporting period, there were 127 complaints by foreign workers against employers who failed to pay salaries involving 34 companies and 26 employers. Eleven companies and 13 employers settled through reconciliation and arbitration, while the remaining cases remain under investigation. Protection Brunei did not demonstrate significant efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims during the reporting period. Brunei does not have a proactive system to formally identify victims of trafficking among vulnerable groups, such as foreign workers and foreign women and children in prostitution. The government did not report identifying any trafficking victims in the past year. The government did not provide centrally coordinated training for its officials on identifying trafficking victims. While the Brunei police reported running a workshop on identifying victims for members of its anti-vice unit, the victim identification measures employed by the unit do not appear to be effective. The government does not provide shelter or rehabilitative services to trafficking victims. One foreign mission reported 20 suspected trafficking cases of women forced into prostitution in Malaysia and traveling to Brunei to obtain work visa reentry permits. Brunei authorities were informed when the Filipino victims were entering the country, and allowed the victims to enter Brunei without proper documentation to assist in their escape from their traffickers. The victims‚Äô embassy provided shelter and repatriation assistance to the victims. The Brunei government did not, however, apprehend the suspected traffickers involved or conduct a criminal investigation. While immigration authorities actively identified and charged violators of immigration law, there were no cases reported of authorities identifying and assisting trafficking victims among immigration violators during the reporting period. As there may have been trafficking victims among these immigration violators, some may have been penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. Although it is illegal for employers in Brunei to withhold wages of their domestic workers for more than 10 days, some families are known to withhold wages to compensate for recruitment fees they are charged and as a tool with which to control workers. There are no NGO's or international organizations in Brunei that provide support to trafficking victims, though the embassies of several source countries provide shelter, mediation, and immigration assistance to their nationals. The government does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Prevention The Brunei government demonstrated limited prevention efforts during the reporting period. The government did not conduct any public awareness campaigns on trafficking. Officials participated in several regional training programs on trafficking. The government provides arrival briefings for foreign workers and runs a telephone hotline for worker complaints. There were no measures taken to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. Brunei is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Bulgarian women and children are subjected to forced prostitution within the country, particularly in resort areas and border towns, as well as in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Finland, Portugal, Greece, Italy, Spain, Poland, Switzerland, Turkey, Cyprus, and Macedonia. Ethnic Roma women and children account for approximately 15 percent of Bulgarian trafficking victims. Bulgarian men, women, and children are subjected to conditions of forced labor in Greece, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Some Bulgarian children are forced into street begging and petty theft within Bulgaria and also in Greece and the United Kingdom. The Government of Bulgaria does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. In 2009, Bulgaria amended Section 159 of its criminal code and increased the minimum penalty for trafficking offenses from one year‚Äôs imprisonment to two years‚Äô imprisonment. The government investigated trafficking-related complicity among officials at various levels of government, although efforts to prosecute complicit officials remained limited. While Bulgaria continued its overall efforts to assist and protect most victims of trafficking, two victims identified during the year were punished for crimes committed as a direct result of trafficking.\\"Bulgaria\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Bulgarian government sustained its strong anti-trafficking law enforcement response to human trafficking over the reporting period. Bulgaria prohibits trafficking for both commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor through Section 159 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties of between two and 15 years‚Äô imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. In 2009, police conducted 131 new trafficking investigations including nine labor trafficking investigations, compared with 187 sex trafficking and 25 labor trafficking investigations conducted in 2008. In 2009, authorities prosecuted 77 individuals for sex trafficking and four for forced labor compared with 79 persons prosecuted for sex trafficking and eight for labor trafficking in 2008. A total of 83 trafficking offenders were convicted ‚Äì 80 for sex trafficking and three for labor trafficking offenses ‚Äì compared with 66 sex trafficking offenders and three labor trafficking offenders convicted in 2008. In 2009, 51 of the 83 convicted trafficking offenders were sentenced to imprisonment, a significant increase from 25 convicted offenders sentenced to serve time in prison in 2008. The government did not report the sentence ranges for those convicted trafficking offenders sentenced to time in prison. During the reporting period, the government partnered with NGOs and IOM to provide trafficking-specific training to 34 judges, 19 prosecutors, 60 labor inspectors, and 60 police officers. Bulgarian law enforcement officials also partnered with law enforcement counterparts from seven other European countries during 17 joint human trafficking investigations. There were continued reports of trafficking-related complicity of government officials during the reporting period. In 2009, two municipal councilors in Varna pleaded guilty to organized human trafficking, including forced prostitution following their arrest in the fall of 2008; one official was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and one official was sentenced to three years‚Äô imprisonment. A third municipal councilor arrested in the same 2008 case did not plead guilty and his trial was ongoing at the time of this report. In a separate case, nine police officers of a local anti-organized crime unit in Vratsa were dismissed from office for assisting a trafficking group, although none of these officials were prosecuted for complicity in human trafficking. As reported in the 2009 Report, the government also investigated one police officer for complicity in trafficking in 2008; however, the government did not demonstrate efforts to prosecute this official at the conclusion of this reporting period. Protection The Government of Bulgaria sustained its overall victim assistance and protection efforts during the year, though it penalized two identified victims of trafficking for crimes committed as a direct result of being trafficked. In 2009, the government identified 289 victims of trafficking ‚Äì including 44 children ‚Äì and referred nearly all of them for assistance, compared with 250 victims identified in 2008. The majority of adult victims were assisted by privately funded NGOs, although both the national and local governments did provide limited in-kind assistance to six anti-trafficking NGOs. The local government in Varna operated an adult trafficking shelter in that city; six victims were assisted by this shelter in 2009. Approximately 100 victims were assisted by government-funded NGOs during the reporting period. The government continued to operate six child-crisis centers that provided rehabilitative, psychological, and medical assistance to identified child victims of trafficking, as well as other children in distress. In 2009, 44 children were provided with government-funded assistance, a significant increase from 25 child trafficking victims assisted in government shelters in 2008. All victims in Bulgaria were eligible for free medical and psychological care provided through public hospitals and NGOs. The government encouraged victims to assist in trafficking investigations and prosecutions; victims who chose to cooperate with law enforcement were provided with full residency and employment rights for the duration of the criminal proceedings; the government reported that no foreign victims requested temporary residency permits during the reporting period. The government permitted foreign victims who chose not to cooperate with trafficking investigations to stay in Bulgaria for one month and 10 days before they faced mandatory repatriation; in 2009, the government granted one such permit to stay for 10 days plus one month. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided training to its officials posted at its embassies regarding the identification and treatment of trafficking victims, including how to refer Bulgarian victims of trafficking found overseas to local NGOs for assistance. During the reporting period, the Bulgarian embassy in Spain identified and referred for assistance six Bulgarian victims of forced labor, including three children. In 2009, five victims participated in the police witness protection program, compared with seven in 2008. In 2009, the government convicted two trafficking victims and sentenced each to a six-month suspended sentence for illegal border crossing, an unlawful act committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. Prevention The Bulgarian government demonstrated significant progress in its efforts to prevent trafficking during the reporting period. The local government in Varna, in partnership with an employment agency and the local university, organized a prevention campaign that educated students about forced labor titled ‚ÄúWhere Are You Traveling?‚Äù The National Commission for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings provided information to more than 350 students about human trafficking and organized an essay and art contest for students to share and discuss their impressions of human trafficking; the Commission presented 50 awards for anti- trafficking illustrations and 30 awards for essays during this contest. The government also demonstrated efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts and to combat child sex tourism. For example, in 2009, the government convicted one foreigner for traveling to Varna to have sex with children and sentenced him to 66 months‚Äô imprisonment; one Bulgarian national was also convicted and sentenced to nine months‚Äô imprisonment for procuring the children. During the reporting period, 14 clients of children in prostitution were prosecuted and convicted and sentenced to up to three years‚Äô imprisonment.

The Government of Burkina Faso provided data from the Ministry of Social Action showing that, in 2009, security forces and regional human trafficking surveillance committees intercepted 788 children Burkinabe and foreign children, 619 of whom were boys, destined for exploitation in other countries, principally C√¥te d'Ivoire, Mali, and Niger. Child trafficking victims who remain inside Burkina Faso are usually found in large cities such as Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Nouna, and Hounde. Child victims face conditions of forced labor or services as plantation and mining hands, laborers on cocoa farms, domestic servants, beggars recruited as pupils by unaccredited Koranic schools, or captives in the prostitution trade. To a lesser extent, traffickers recruit Burkinabe women for nonconsensual commercial sexual exploitation in Europe. Women from neighboring countries like Nigeria, Togo, Benin, and Niger migrate to Burkina Faso on the promise of respectable work, but are subjected to forced labor in bars or forced prostitution. The Government of Burkina Faso does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. The number of child victims intercepted in 2009 exceeds by 100 the already high rate recorded in the previous reporting period. Yet massive flooding in September 2009 destroyed many files and computer systems holding data on trafficking investigations and prosecutions during the year. In prior years, the government conscientiously reported such information. Protection and assistance efforts for victims continued to the extent the country's strained resources allowed.\\"Burkina Faso\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The effectiveness of the government's anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts in 2009 was difficult to assess due to a natural disaster's destruction of relevant records. Burkina Faso's May 2008 anti-trafficking law prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes maximum punishments for convicted offenders as high as 20 years or life imprisonment; these penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with prescribed penalties for other serious offenses, such as rape. The government has not reported whether successful prosecutions in 2009 led to significantly longer sentences than sentences given to convicted offenders in previous reporting periods. The government claimed to have investigated and prosecuted a number of suspected trafficking offenders in 2009; computerized and paper- based police and court records of these cases were subsequently lost in September 2009 flooding. There was no evidence of government officials' complicity in trafficking, though some corrupt law enforcement agents may have facilitated trafficking-related activity. Protection The government was not in a position to provide many services directly to trafficking victims. In 2009, however, the Ministry of Social Action, together with security forces and regional anti-trafficking committees, identified and referred 788 child victims to some of the 23 transit centers jointly funded by the government and UNICEF. The government also provided approximately $85,000 for support and school fees to 50 orphanages and nurseries where the risk of child trafficking was significant ‚Äì an unusual commitment of support from a government with limited resources. To help foreign victims return to their homes countries quickly, the government processed their travel documents and collaborated with NGOs to ensure a safe return. Burkinabe law permits a victim to seek legal action against trafficking offenders, but official agencies did not report any such cases in 2009, or any instances of victims assisting in the prosecution of suspected offenders. The government does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution. Nationals of ECOWAS states, including trafficking victims, however, may legally reside and work in Burkina Faso. The government made efforts to sensitize law enforcement agents to child trafficking issues during the reporting period, but did not develop official programs to train officials in identifying victims. The prevalence of child trafficking in the country is well known, but officials and private citizens alike have difficulty distinguishing between children who migrate voluntarily for work, and those who are victims of trafficking. Prevention Strong partnerships with NGOs and international organizations allowed the Burkinabe government to sustain nationwide anti-trafficking information and education campaigns during the last year. Local and international partners supported workshops and seminars focused on child trafficking, and government and private media aired radio and television programs that impacted approximately 600,000 people. The government distributed thousands of booklets describing the Anti-TI P National Action Plan, but was not able to implement the plan. The mayor of Ouagadougou took some steps to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts by closing 37 brothels in the capital in 2009. The government provided Burkinabe military troops with human rights and trafficking training prior to their deployment abroad as international peacekeepers.

John Chellis Conner's obituary Archived Conner was born in Kahoka, Missouri in 1913. At the age of six he began his studies of piano and percussion instruments. By the age of twelve, he was playing regularly on the radio with the KMOX Junior Orchestra. As a young artist he was a member of the International Marimba Symphony Orchestra during their European tour in 1935. Before pursuing a solo career, he was a member of both the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and the St. Louis Municipal Opera Orchestra and was regularly heard on major St. Louis radio stations. He served overseas with the USO in the European theater and he later toured South America with the Xavier Cugat Orchestra. As one of the first percussionists to take the marimba and vibraphone into the classical world as solo instruments, he made his New York debut at Town Hall in 1950. After hearing Conner‚Äôs artistry on the instruments, Darius Milhaud, the French composer, was inspired to compose a concerto for Conner to perform. This Concerto for Marimba and Vibraphone was given its world premier with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra in 1948 with Vladimir Golschmann conducting. In addition to his classical career, Conner was a jazz musician, especially in the New York City area. He was associated with Roger Williams, the pianist, with whom he had a 25-year association. He also performed with the Don Ho show in Hawaii and Las Vegas and served as music director and conductor for Anita Bryant. He also appeared on numerous radio and television programs such as Merv Griffin, Mike Douglas and the Lawrence Welk Show. Conner‚Äôs greatest love was inspirational and sacred music and he had a longtime association with Youth for Christ and World Vision, and his ministry in Christian music took him into concert halls, theaters, and churches throughout the world. He was also a producer of Christian films such as ‚ÄúIn God We Trust‚Äù, which he wrote and in which he played a major role. He made numerous recordings featuring both the marimba and vibraphone. In 1990 he was presented the honorary degree, Doctor of Sacred Music, by Trinity College of Florida.

Children of Myanmar are subjected to forced labor as sellers and beggars in Thailand. Many men, women, and children from Thailand, Malaysia, China, Bangladesh, India, and South Korea who migrate abroad for work are trafficked into conditions of forced or bonded labor or commercial sexual exploitation. Economic conditions within Myanmar have led to the increased legal and illegal migration of citizens regionally and internationally, often to destinations as far from Myanmar as the Middle East. Men are subjected to forced labor in the fishing and construction industries abroad. Women of Myanmar who migrate to Thailand, China, and Malaysia for economic opportunities are found in situations of forced labor and forced prostitution. Some trafficking victims transit through Myanmar from Bangladesh to Malaysia and from China to Thailand and beyond. The government has yet to address the systemic political and economic problems that cause the people of Myanmar to seek employment through both legal and illegal means in neighboring countries. Myanmar's internal trafficking remains the most serious concern. Exploiters traffic girls for the purpose of prostitution, particularly in urban areas. In some areas, in particular international sex trafficking of women and girls, the Government of Myanmar is making significant efforts. Nonetheless, serious problems remain in Myanmar, and in some areas, most notably in the area of forced labor, the Government of Myanmar is not complying with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The regime's widespread use of and lack of accountability in forced labor and recruitment of child soldiers is the top causal factor for Myanmar's significant trafficking problem. The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Legal actions The Government of Myanmar reported some progress in law enforcement efforts against cross-border sex trafficking during the reporting period. Myanmar prohibits sex and labor trafficking through its 2005 Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law, which prescribes criminal penalties that are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for rape. The recruitment of children into the army is a criminal offense under Penal Code Section 374, which could result in imprisonment for up to one year, or a fine, or both. Military involvement The military of Myanmar engages in the unlawful conscription of child soldiers, and continues to be the main perpetrator of forced labor inside Myanmar. The direct government and military use of forced or compulsory labor remains a widespread and serious problem, particularly targeting members of ethnic minority groups, such as the Shan people. Military and civilian officials systematically used men, women, and children for forced labor for the development of infrastructure and state-run agricultural and commercial ventures, as well as forced portering for the military. Those living in areas with the highest military presence, including remote border areas populated by ethnic groups, are most at risk for forced labor. Military and civilian officials subject men, women, and children to forced labor. Men and thousands of boys as young as 10 years old are forcibly recruited (due often to desertions) to serve in the National Army and ethnic armed groups through intimidation, coercion, threats, and violence. Children of the urban poor are at particular risk of involuntary conscription; UN reports indicate that the army has targeted orphans and children on the streets and in railway stations, and young novice monks from monasteries for recruitment. Children are threatened with jail if they do not agree to join the army, and are sometimes physically abused. Children are subjected to forced labor in tea shops, home industries, and agricultural plantations. In December 2009, the military of Myanmar reported that it dismissed a captain from the military via court martial and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment in a civilian jail for child soldier recruitment ‚Äì the first ever criminal conviction of a military official involved in child soldier recruitment. In the same case, an additional two privates were sentenced to three months' and one-month military imprisonment, respectively. Myanmar law enforcement officials generally were not able to investigate or prosecute cases of military-perpetrated forced labor or child soldier recruitment absent assent from high-ranking military officers. The government also reported investigating, prosecuting, and convicting some internal trafficking offenders, though there was only one reported criminal prosecution of a member of the National Army for his role in child soldier cases. The government continued to incarcerate six individuals who reported forced labor cases involving the regime to the International Labour Organization (ILO) or were otherwise active in working with the ILO on forced labor issues. Government response to human rights While forced labor is widely considered to be the most serious trafficking problem in Myanmar, authorities reported that most trafficking cases investigated and prosecuted involved women and girls subjected to forced marriage or intended to be subjected to forced marriage. The Myanmar regime rules arbitrarily through its unilaterally imposed laws, but rule of law is absent, as is an independent judiciary that would respect trafficking victims‚Äô rights. The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), Myanmar's military government, has not acknowledged the prevalence of human rights issues within their country, specifically human trafficking. No one has been held accountable for the serious crimes committed by government security forces. These crimes include forced labor, child soldiers, and personal, including sexual, violence. Corruption The Myanmar regime reported investigating 155 cases of trafficking, prosecuting 410 individuals, and convicting 88 offenders in 2009, an increase from 342 reported prosecutions in 2008; however, these statistics included 12 cases of abduction for adoption, which are not considered ‚Äútrafficking‚Äù by international standards. Additionally, court proceedings are not open and lack due process for defendants. While the Myanmar regime has in the past been known to conflate illegal migration with trafficking, leading to the punishment of consensual emigrants and those who assist them to emigrate, the police reported some efforts to exclude smuggling cases from human trafficking figures during the reporting period, and improved their transparency in handling cases. Nevertheless, limited capacity and training of the police coupled with a lack of transparency in the justice system make it uncertain whether all trafficking statistics provided by authorities were indeed for trafficking cases. Corruption and lack of accountability remains pervasive in Myanmar, affecting all aspects of society. Police can be expected to self-limit investigations when well-connected individuals are involved in forced labor cases. Although the government reported four officials prosecuted for involvement in human trafficking in 2009, the government did not release any details of the cases. ILO and international cooperation Myanmar law enforcement reported continued cooperation with Chinese counterparts on cross- border trafficking cases, including joint operations, as well as general cooperation with Thai authorities. In 2009, the ILO continued to receive and investigate forced labor complaints; 93 cases were submitted to the Myanmar government for action, an increase from 64 cases in 2008; 54 cases remain open and are awaiting a response from the government. Despite a report of a child labor case involving as many as 100 children on an agricultural plantation near Rangoon, the regime did not report any efforts to investigate the allegation. Many minors from Myanmar work in Thai border towns, particularly the town of Mae Sai. Drivers who smuggle illegal workers into Thailand go to villages to recruit minors, and then transport them to the border. In one such case found in a survey, a girl was deceived by a driver, and sold into prostitution. Between 20,000 and 30,000 women and girls from Myanmar are estimated to be working in the prostitution industry in Thailand. As illegal immigrants, they are often arrested and deported back to Myanmar. About 50 to 70 percent of the prostitutes are HIV positive. In other cases, children from Myanmar were tricked during their recruitment, and not paid for the jobs they were promised. It is believed that the children from Myanmar make up the largest sector of foreign working children. Minors also participate in the fishing industry and work in Bangkok, though this is not as common. The ethnic minorities from Myanmar working in Thailand were also found to have the lowest education in all minor workers surveyed, at about 1.3 years, and Burmese were found to have only a slightly higher education level, on average roughly four years. The minors from Myanmar that work in Thailand usually left for economic reasons. A lack of job opportunities in Myanmar has contributed to the rise of human trafficking operations; the trade is now no longer targeting just rural areas, but is reaching the country's major cities. Many of the 2.5 million migrants from Myanmar came to Thailand to find low-paying domestic jobs during the militaristic regime previously in place. These migrants often lack basic education and access to social security benefits. Conversations between the US and Myanmar have been more frequent in recent years. The U.S. Ambassador-at- Large for the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, Luis CdeBaca, and Myanmar Police Chief Major General Zaw Win concurred in the need for government-civil society partnerships, health care, and prevention. The latest reports from Washington indicate that the US feels improvements are underway. Prosecution of victims Victims of forced labor cases are not protected from countersuit by regime officials. During the reporting period, 17 complainants and their associates in a series of forced labor cases involving 328 farmers in Magwe Division were prosecuted and jailed by local authorities for their role in reporting forced labor perpetrated by local government officials. Myanmar courts later released 13 of the individuals, but four complainants remain in prison. The central government did not intervene with local authorities to stop the politically motivated harassment, including lengthy interrogations, of the forced labor complainants. Such unaccountable harassment and punishment discouraged additional forced labor complaints. On February 28, 2014, Myanmar officials decided to ban Doctors Without Borders from the state of Rakhine after the organization discovered and treated 40 victims of a rampage between Muslim and Buddhist citizens that the government denies took place. The United Nations states that its negotiations with Myanmar to allow Doctors Without Borders into the Rakhine state are of special importance, as citizens lack the ability to report human rights abuses for fear of becoming victims of the human trafficking or violence themselves. For victims of human trafficking, Doctors Without Borders is often the only access to health care they have. Protection The regime made efforts to protect repatriated victims of cross-border sex trafficking to China and Thailand, though it exhibited no discernible efforts to protect victims of internal trafficking and transnational labor trafficking. In forced labor cases, some victims, notably 17 individuals in Magwe Division, were harassed, detained, or otherwise penalized for making accusations against officials who pressed them into forced labor. The government reported identifying 302 victims, most of whom were victims of forced marriage rather than explicitly trafficking victims, and reported assisting an additional 425 victims identified and repatriated by foreign governments in 2009, including 293 from China and 132 from Thailand. The regime did not identify any male trafficking victims. Victims were sheltered and detained in non-specialized Department of Social Welfare facilities for a mandatory minimum of two weeks, which stretched into months if authorities could not find an adult family member to accept the victim. While in government facilities, victims had access to counseling, thought it was often substandard, but had limited access to social workers. There were no shelter facilities available to male victims of trafficking. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were sometimes allowed access to victims in government shelters, but the regime continued to bar NGOs from operating shelters for trafficking victims. The regime did not have in place formal victim identification procedures. While the government reported that it encouraged victims to assist in investigations and prosecutions, it did not appear to provide financial support or other assistance to victims to serve as incentives to participate in the prosecution of their traffickers. The regime cooperated with the ILO on the issue of the military's conscription of children, resulting in the return of 31 children to their families. However, numerous children undoubtedly continue to serve in the Myanmar Army and in ethnic militias. The government has done little to help international organizations assess the scope of the problem. The regime did not permit UNICEF access to children who were released through the government's mechanisms for follow-up purposes. Additionally, some child recruits have been prosecuted and sentenced for deserting the military and remain in prison. Prevention Myanmar made limited efforts to prevent international human trafficking over the last year, and made few discernible efforts to prevent the more prevalent internal trafficking, particularly forced labor and child conscription by regime officials and ethnic armed groups. The government continued awareness campaigns using billboards, flyers, and videos during the reporting period and state-run television aired a documentary on human trafficking produced by the MTV EXIT Campaign. The government of Myanmar reported forming three new anti-trafficking units in 2009, and reported a 40 percent overall increase in spending on prevention efforts. During the reporting period, the government signed Memoranda of Understanding with China and Thailand on trafficking in persons. The regime sustained partnerships with Mekong region governments and the UN in the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative Against Trafficking (COMMIT), and hosted the COMMIT Senior Officials Meeting in January 2010.

Children and young adults may also be coerced into forced labor on plantations or small farms in southern Burundi, or to conduct informal commerce in the streets. Some traffickers are the victims‚Äô family members or friends who, under the pretext of assisting underprivileged children with education or with false promises of lucrative jobs, subject them to forced labor, most commonly as domestic servants. While there is little evidence of large-scale child prostitution, ‚Äúbenevolent‚Äù older females offer vulnerable younger girls room and board within their homes, and in some cases eventually push them into prostitution to pay for living expenses; extended family members also financially profit from the commercial sexual exploitation of young relatives residing with them. Male tourists from Oman and the United Arab Emirates exploit Burundian girls in prostitution. Businessmen recruit Burundian girls for commercial sexual exploitation in Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda, and recruit boys and girls for exploitation in various types of forced labor in Tanzania. Unlike in past years, there were no reports of forced or voluntary recruitment of children into government armed forces or rebel groups during the reporting period. The government made clear progress in combating trafficking during the reporting period, particularly with regard to identifying trafficking victims, investigating potential trafficking offenses, and raising public awareness. In 2009, a Bujumbura court heard a case involving child domestic servitude, the first known prosecution of a case involving elements of a human trafficking offense. Significant work remains, however, in educating government officials and local populations about the nature of human trafficking, bringing cases to trial, and providing protective services to victims.\\"Burundi\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. Prosecution The government's anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts increased during the reporting period, particularly its efforts to detect and investigate suspected human trafficking offenses. This progress continued, however, to be hampered by lack of investigative equipment and training, poor evidence gathering by police, the unwillingness of victims to lodge complaints, and the failure of prosecutors to vigorously pursue cases after receiving evidence from police and suspected victims. Articles 242 and 243 of Burundi's criminal code prohibit human trafficking and smuggling, and prescribe sentences of five to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment; the code does not, however, provide a definition of human trafficking, limiting its utility. Sex trafficking offenses can also be punished using penal code statutes on brothel-keeping and pimping (penalties of one to five years‚Äô imprisonment), as well as child prostitution (penalties of five to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment). These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious offenses, such as rape. The criminal code prescribes no explicit penalties for forced labor, though it is prohibited by Article 2 of the labor law. A Bujumbura court fined a woman $42 for abusing her 12-year-old domestic servant by burning her with melted plastic bags. Upon her arrest, police located the child's aunt, who returned the child to her parents in Bururi province. In August 2009, police arrested a Burundian man for kidnapping six boys between the ages of 12 and 13 and transporting them to Tanzania for forced labor in tobacco fields. The suspect's provisional release was revoked after an appeal from the prosecutor's office, and he remains in pre-trial detention in Rutana Province prison. Throughout 2009, the Women and Children's Brigade, a specialized police unit, successfully identified and rescued 10 of 17 child victims exploited by an international prostitution ring and returned them to their families; the alleged traffickers have not been arrested due to a lack of concrete evidence. In January 2010, police charged three men and their landlord with corruption of minors and incitement to debauchery after the former were found pimping underage girls from a rental house; the prosecution remained in the pre-trial stage at the end of the reporting period. During a December 2009 meeting with high-ranking police officials, President Nkurunziza instructed the police force to increase efforts to fight human trafficking. As a result of this mandate, police initiated a crackdown on clandestine brothels that housed potential trafficking victims in January 2010, shutting down three small hotels in the industrial quarter of Bujumbura. The government did not provide trafficking- specific training for law enforcement officials. Protection Despite its notable efforts to return trafficked children to their families, the government did not adequately ensure that trafficking victims received access to necessary protective services during the reporting period. The few care centers that exist in Burundi are operated by NGO's, religious organizations, and women's or children's associations. Police provided limited shelter and food assistance to victims in temporary police custody while authorities attempted to locate their families; these children were housed in a holding area separate from adult detainees. In some instances, the police, especially members of the Women and Children's Brigade, provided counseling to children in prostitution and mediated between these victims and their parents. In January 2010, police rescued three child sex trafficking victims from a brothel in Bujumbura, documented their testimonies, and returned them to their families. In 2009, government officials identified 18 trafficking victims, 10 of whom were victims of forced prostitution and eight of whom were victims of forced labor. In January 2010, Burundi's Interpol office assisted the government in repatriating a 15-year-old Burundian boy from Rwanda where he was forced to work as a domestic servant. In cooperation with Tanzanian police, the government repatriated six Burundian child trafficking victims from Tanzania in July 2009. Between April and June, the National Commission for Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration oversaw the demobilization and short-term care of the final 380 child soldiers from the Forces Nationale de Lib√©ration (FNL) rebel group and from among alleged FNL dissidents in the Randa and Buramata sites. With outside funding, the Commission's staff provided medical screening, psychosocial counseling, and sensitization on peaceful cohabitation, while conducting family tracing; the children were reunited with their families in July 2009. In October 2009, the government established a Municipal Council for Children and Youth (CMEJ) to assist at- risk youth and develop a transit center for victims of human trafficking, demobilized child soldiers, and street children. The CMEJ began drafting an action plan in March 2010 and sought the necessary international funding to become fully operational. The government has not developed a system for proactively identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations or a referral process to transfer such trafficking victims to organizations providing services. While police interviewed child victims during the investigations of their abusers, the prosecutor's office did not pursue the possibility of child victims' participation in prosecutions of trafficking offenders. The government did not inappropriately incarcerate or otherwise penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Burundian law did not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to a country where they may face hardship or retribution. Prevention The government made clear progress in its efforts to prevent trafficking during the year. In February 2010, the Commander of the Women and Children's Brigade began a tour of the country to sensitize local government officials and inform local populations on the danger of human trafficking. In 2009, the Ministry of Labor sponsored eight workshops for teachers, magistrates, communal administrators, and agricultural workers to raise awareness of the dangers of child labor and trafficking. In partnerships with the ILO and UNICEF, it also conducted a sensitization campaign in several provinces to warn against child trafficking for forced labor and abusing former child soldiers, centered on the World Day Against Child Labour in June. The Ministry of Labor's 12 inspectors conducted no child labor inspections in 2009. The government did not undertake efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period. The pre-deployment anti-trafficking training for Burundian peacekeepers, provided by a foreign government, included a curriculum that created awareness and discouraged acts of trafficking and sexual exploitation.

She won the gold medal in the women's eight at the 2012 Summer Games in London. Lofgren is a graduate of Harvard College, where she rowed for Radcliffe Crew and was a two-time All- American. She is an eight-time member of the U.S. National Rowing Team and a seven-time World Championship medalist. Early life Lofgren attended Mariners Elementary School and Ensign Middle School in Newport Beach, California. She graduated as valedictorian from Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, California, where she played volleyball and basketball with fellow 2012 Olympian April Ross before taking up rowing. Introduced to the sport in 1998, Lofgren began rowing at the Newport Aquatic Center, where Olympic Gold Medalist Xeno M√ºller coached her for a season. Lofgren helped the women's junior team qualify the eight for the National Youth Invitational for the first time in the program's history, and performed well enough by her junior and senior years to be recruited by top schools. Lofgren continued rowing at Harvard University, where she was twice named a first-team DI All- American, as well as a winner of the Athletic Excellence Award her senior year. She also competed on the U.S. National Rowing Team, making the squad for the first time as a college sophomore, and won two Under-23 golds and a Senior World Championships silver and bronze while still an undergrad. (YH) After college, Lofgren decided to pursue rowing full-time and moved to Princeton, New Jersey to join the USRowing Training Center. Career After her sophomore year in college, Lofgren earned a seat on both the Under-23 and the Senior National Teams, winning and setting the World Record in the BW8+ and taking bronze in the W4- with future Olympic teammate Erin Cafaro. The next year, Lofgren joined future Olympic teammate Genevra Stone to win the BW4x. Lofgren took the year off from college to compete for a spot on the Beijing Olympic squad, in 2008, but was instead the last woman cut from the selection camp. Lofgren then stroked the W4- to a silver medal at the 2008 World Rowing Championships. She also stroked the W4- to a silver medal at the 2009 World Rowing Championships, this time with future Olympic teammate Elle Logan. After graduating from Harvard in 2009, Lofgren joined the USRowing Training Center in Princeton, NJ. She overcame two late-season rib fractures to earn a seat in the 2010 World Championship W8+, which took gold at Lake Karapiro in New Zealand. In 2011, she became the first woman ever, and the first athlete since Sir Matthew Pinsent in 2001, to win two Championship events at the Henley Royal Regatta, winning the Remenham Challenge Cup (women's eight) and the Princess Grace Challenge Cup (women's quadruple sculls). She was the first athlete ever to win both a sweep Championship event and a sculling Championship event in the same Henley Royal Regatta. Lofgren then went on to win gold at Lake Bled in Slovenia as part of the 2011 USA World Championship Women's 8+. In 2012, Lofgren joined Mary Whipple, Caryn Davies, Caroline Lind, Amanda Polk, Meghan Musnicki, Taylor Ritzel, Jamie Redman, and Susan Francia to set the World Record in the women's 8+ in the heats of the Lucerne Rowing World Cup. She then joined Whipple, Davies, Lind, Elle Logan, Musnicki, Ritzel, Francia, and Erin Cafaro to win gold at the London 2012 Olympic Games. When she won a gold medal in women's eight at the 2012 London Games, Lofgren knew her perseverance had paid off. Regarding the win, she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a seven-year journey to make this team and all the hard work was worth it.‚Äú Lofgren raced in the women's 4x at the 2013 Lucerne Rowing World Cup, finishing 6th, and in the women's 4x at the 2013 World Rowing Championships, finishing 5th. At the 2015 MidAtlantic Erg Sprints, Lofgren \\"shattered\\" the half-marathon indoor rowing World Record by more than three minutes, finishing in a time of 1 hour, 20 minutes and 12.1 seconds. Non-competition awards and accolades In 2009, Lofgren received Radcliffe Crew's Athletic Excellence award and was named a D1 First-Team All-American in 2008 and 2009. As a high school student, she was awarded a National Merit Scholarship. In 2012, Lofgren and her Olympic gold medal women's 8+ crew were awarded the Ernestine Bayer Award, given by USRowing for contributions to women's rowing. In 2017, Lofgren, along with rugby legend Phaidra Knight and water polo legend Brenda Villa, was awarded the Yolanda L. Jackson Give Back Award by the Women's Sports Foundation for athletes who exemplify what it means to be a role model, and who know the importance of giving back. Personal life Lofgren comes from a family of rowers. Her parents, Karl and Christine Lofgren, met in the boathouse at MIT and moved to Long Beach, California in the early 1980s to train for the Olympic rowing team that would compete at the Los Angeles Olympic Games. Her parents both fell just short of that dream ‚Äî including her mother being the last woman cut from selection camp for the Olympic quadruple sculls crew that went on to win gold ‚Äî but decided to start a family instead. Esther Ruth Lofgren was born the following year. Lofgren blogs on her personal blog Harder.Better.Faster.Stronger, where she shares training tips, playlists, and an inside look at life as an elite rower and athlete. She enjoys reading, running, cycling, blogging, and photography and aspires to run a sub-three hour marathon and complete an Ironman triathlon. She also posts information about her coaching services and upcoming speaking engagements and appearances on her website, http://estherlofgren.com. In 2015, Lofgren married Jacob Barrett. They have one child and currently live in Germany. Lofgren currently works as Vice President of Business Development and Marketing for The SPECTRUM Group. From 2012 to 2015, she served on the Board of Directors of USRowing, and as the peer-elected rowing representative to the United States Olympic Committee's Athlete Advisory Council. She is also involved with the Women's Sports Foundation. Lofgren works continually to expand girls' and women's access to sports and rowing through advocacy work, public appearances, speaking engagements, and various forms of social media.

Individual trafficking operations usually involve the trafficking of two or three children at most, as when rural parents hand over their children to a seemingly benevolent middleman who may promise education and a better life in the city. A 2007 study conducted by the Cameroon government reported that 2.4 million children from Cameroon‚Äôs ten regions involuntarily work in forced domestic servitude, street vending, and child prostitution, or in hazardous settings, including mines and tea or cocoa plantations, where they are treated as adult labourers. An unknown number of these children are trafficking victims. Nigerian and Beninese children attempting to transit Cameroon en route to Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, or adjacent countries also fall into the hands of traffickers who force them to stay in the country and work. An unknown number of Cameroonian women are lured abroad by fraudulent proposals of marriage on the Internet or offers of work in domestic service and subsequently become victims of forced labor or forced prostitution ‚Äì principally in Switzerland and France, and according to recent reports, as far away as Russia. This trafficking reportedly is facilitated by corrupt officials who accept bribes for the issuance of travel documents. The State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Cameroon does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. However, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, the government did not show evidence of increasing efforts to convict and punish trafficking offenders, including complicit officials, and to identify and protect victims of trafficking. While state prosecutors coordinated efforts with Interpol to investigate suspected trafficking offenses, particularly in the Northwest Region, there have been no reports of new trafficking prosecutions or convictions. Experts consider the 2005 law against child trafficking to be well written but underused because there is no system to provide relevant judicial officials with copies of new laws. Judges, law enforcement officials, and social workers do not enforce the legislation because they are not familiar with it. The government did not take measures to complete and enact a 2006 draft law prohibiting trafficking of adults. It failed to investigate reports of maintaining hereditary servants in involuntary servitude in the Northern Region. In August 2009, the Ministry of Social Affairs, in partnership with UNICEF and NGO's, began to develop a guide for protecting vulnerable children from exploitation, including trafficking, but did not complete a draft by the expected deadline at the end of 2009.\\"Cameroon\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Cameroon demonstrated weak anti- trafficking law enforcement efforts over the last year. The government enacted no relevant legislation during the reporting period, and the country does not have a law prohibiting all forms of trafficking in persons, as its 2006 draft law against adult trafficking has yet to be passed and enacted. The country‚Äôs existing 2005 law against child trafficking and slavery prescribes a penalty of 20 years‚Äô imprisonment for these offenses ‚àí a punishment that is sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses. During the reporting period, authorities investigated 26 new cases of human trafficking, as well as 18 other cases of possible trafficking offenses, none of which has resulted in a prosecution. All of the 26 cases involved children, and 10 of the cases were arrests and detentions pending trials. Several factors delay these cases, including the limited number of gendarmes and police officers available in rural areas, poor understanding of trafficking issues among victims who may be illiterate, and the lack of any security units specifically assigned to anti-trafficking details. The remaining 16 cases were alleged trafficking offenders who were caught in the act and arrested, but finally released after the matter was resolved either at the level of security forces, social affairs agencies, or a human rights lawyer‚Äôs chambers. To address these cases, officials used the 2005 anti-child trafficking law and the pertinent provisions of the penal code. The government reported no trafficking convictions during the reporting period. The government did not investigate traditional leaders in the Northern Region suspected of keeping hereditary servants in conditions of involuntary servitude. Official sources give no indication that the government facilitates or condones trafficking, though there were signs of some officials‚Äô involvement in trafficking. In November 2009, a Bamenda-based lawyer filed a complaint against a commissioner of one of the police districts for complicity in child trafficking. The lawyer claimed that the commissioner opposed the arrest and detention of a woman caught while committing transnational trafficking. The Bamenda High Court took no action on the complaint against the police commissioner during the reporting period. Protection The Cameroonian government showed sustained but weak efforts, which were limited due to financial constraints, to ensure that victims of trafficking received access to necessary assistance during the year. The government acknowledged that trafficking is a problem in Cameroon, and provided some direct assistance to victims, including temporary residency status, shelter, and medical care. Government personnel did not demonstrate systematic and proactive efforts to identify trafficking victims among vulnerable groups, such as street children, women in prostitution, and illegal migrants, or refer these victims to necessary care, though government officials did informally refer victims to service providers. The government did not discriminate on the basis of country of origin of trafficking victims; however, it did not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. The informal system employed by government personnel for referring victims in need of short- and long-term shelter to government-run or NGO facilities is cumbersome. Once security officials identified individuals as trafficking victims, they addressed a report to the local administrative authority, which in turn directed victims to the appropriate government agency for appropriate action, including the provision of lodging in shelters or homes, medical care, and food. By year‚Äôs end, the government had begun to renovate the few care centers it maintains for trafficking victims. In August 2009, the Ministry of Social Affairs began working with UNICEF to draft a manual that would show families respected in local communities how to create foster homes that provide shelter, food, health care, and education to trafficking victims ‚Äì a new model for protection in the country, scheduled to begin in 2010. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases. Victims were provided the opportunity to file civil suits against trafficking offenders, though in the case of child victims, adult family members needed to instigate proceedings. At least one such case was pending in the Northwest Region at the end of the reporting period, with an 18-year-old victim, supported by local organizations, suing an alleged trafficking offender. Through the National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms, and national and international NGOs, the government for the first time provided specialized training on how to identify trafficking victims to some of its officials, including law enforcement officers, in four regions of the country beginning in July 2009. Prevention The Cameroonian government sustained weak trafficking prevention efforts over the last year. Radio and television broadcast the government‚Äôs anti-trafficking message daily, sometimes wrapped in sports-star endorsements or public service announcements. The government reported that customs agents, border police, and gendarmerie units increased monitoring of the country‚Äôs borders, notably at seaports and airports, but land borders continued to be rarely patrolled. Individuals passed freely between Cameroon and neighbor states. The government reported no measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts within Cameroon. The government did not provide members of the Cameroonian armed forces with training on human trafficking prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions.

He did not approve of verbose counsel, and would often succinctly summarise their arguments. He was known as a compassionate but businesslike judge. Early in life, he played as an amateur cricketer, appearing in fourteen first-class cricket matches during a career that spanned from 1881 until 1885. Primarily used for his fast-medium pace bowling, Parfitt played for both Surrey and Somerset during this time, and later appeared for Warwickshire in second-class cricket. Life and judicial career Parfitt was born in Bwlch, Breconshire, Wales on 23 December 1857, the son of Mr J. J. Parfitt of Bruton, Somerset. Parfitt's family were staunch Roman Catholics; he was educated at Prior Park College in Bath, a Roman Catholic school. His uncle, Charles Parfitt, was a clergyman in the same area. Parfitt later went up to London University, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1884. He worked in education for a time, acting as a tutor at St George's College in Weybridge, Surrey and then for three years at The Oratory School in Edgbaston, Birmingham, both Roman Catholic schools. Parfitt married Elizabeth Mary Reynolds in 1900. He was called to the bar in 1887 by the Middle Temple, of which he later became a Bencher in 1917. He initially joined the Midlands circuit as a junior counsel for the Post Office, and then a counsel to the Birmingham Assay Office. He was appointed as a Queen's Counsel in 1908, and was appointed as Recorder of Nottingham in 1916, a role he maintained until 1918. He was subsequently made a County Court Judge for the Leeds and Wakefield circuit from 1918 until 1921, and then briefly for the Sussex circuit in 1921. He served as the County Court Judge for Clerkenwell from 1921 until his death. Parfitt died on 17 May 1926 at his home in Wimbledon. He was known for his good memory, which helped him maintain a thorough knowledge of case law, and for his ability to summarise cases quickly and effectively. He favoured similarly succinct approaches from others, and would often reproach overly wordy counsel by saying \\"Now you are wandering all round the Wrekin\\", referencing the area in which he grew up. He was also quoted as referencing cricket in the courtroom; he would use \\"that's not cricket\\" as a stern rebuke, while he once also gave the judgment, \\"Verdict for the defendant. Plaintiff is out, bowled middle stump, and in any case he'd have been stumped.\\" Parfitt retained his traditional Roman Catholic beliefs, and his witticisms were sometimes quoted by the press. He was praised for his compassion and common sense. His obituary in The Times suggested that he struggled with modern inventions, particularly the telephone. Cricket career Parfitt began his cricket career in 1881 at Surrey County Cricket Club, while studying at London University. He was chiefly known for his fast bowling, but could also be a useful batsman and fielded well in the slips or at mid-off. His debut came on 11 August against Yorkshire, in which he claimed three wickets during the first innings. He was fond of recalling that he bowled George Ulyett, an England Test cricketer, with his first delivery in first-class cricket. In his second match, a week later, Parfitt returned the best figures of his first-class career, taking seven wickets during the first innings, every one of them bowled. He collected another three wickets in the second innings to complete his only ten-wicket haul. In the six first-class matches he played during his maiden season, Parfitt took 22 wickets at an average of 17.95. He appeared just twice for Surrey in 1882, taking two wickets. He switched from Surrey to Somerset for the 1883 season. He qualified for Somerset based on his residency in the county from 1867 to 1879, and did not have to serve an additional qualification period. As with his time at Surrey, he was only available for the county during the school holidays. He made his debut in August 1883, during which he scored his largest total with the bat, remaining unbeaten on 41 runs when Somerset were dismissed in their second innings against Gloucestershire. He appeared for the county in four matches in 1883, and then twice more during 1885, his final first-class match being played in mid-August 1885, between Somerset and Surrey. He claimed one wicket in the match, which Somerset lost by an innings and 301 runs to Parfitt's former club. He played one second-class match for Warwickshire in 1886, batting at number six against Staffordshire. He was involved in the Emeriti Cricket Club, a wandering cricket club composed of players drawn primarily from Catholic schools.

Most child victims are trafficked within the country, but a smaller number move back and forth from Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan. Trafficking offenders, including members of expatriate communities from Nigeria, Sudan, and Chad, as well as transient merchants and herders, subject children to involuntary domestic servitude, commercial sexual exploitation, or forced labor in agriculture, diamond mines, and street vending. The groups most at risk for trafficking are children for forced labor, Ba‚Äôaka (Pygmy) minorities for forced agricultural work, and girls for the sex trade in urban centers. The Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army continues to abduct and harbor enslaved Sudanese, Congolese, Central African, and Ugandan children in the CAR for use as cooks, porters, and combatants; some of these children are also taken back and forth across borders into Sudan or the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Human rights observers reported that opposition militia groups in the north of the country continued to unlawfully conscript children as young as 12 years old in armed service. Two of the main rebel groups, however, the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR) and the Army for the Restitution of Democracy (APRD), ceased all recruitment of children during the reporting period as a result of disarmament, demobilization, and reinsertion activities. UNICEF reported that the APRD released 711 child soldiers in 2009; approximately 30 percent were between 10 and 14 years old, and of those, 70 percent had served in armed combat. The UFDR demobilized 180 child soldiers during the year. Though the UFDR and APRD deny the presence of additional children in their ranks, some observers believe they still harbor children between the ages of 15 and 17 years old. Village self-defense units, some of which are government-supported, used children as combatants, lookouts, and porters during the year; UNICEF estimates that children comprise one-third of the self-defense units. The Government of the Central African Republic does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources, cross-border incursions from three neighboring countries, and chronic political instability. In 2010, the government enacted an amendment to its penal code prohibiting and prescribing punishments for human trafficking offenses. The Minister of Justice, however, suspended the activities of the Inter-ministerial Committee to Fight Child Exploitation, pending a review of the draft Family Code to ensure that the legislation authorizes such a committee to exist and act effectively; this new code will determine the legal framework of the inter-ministerial committee‚Äôs work. The government did not take law enforcement action against traffickers, identify or provide protective services to child trafficking victims, or adequately raise public awareness of the phenomenon during the reporting period.\\"Central African Republic\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. Prosecution While the government failed to investigate, prosecute, or convict trafficking offenses during the reporting period, it made efforts to strengthen its anti- trafficking legal statutes. In September 2009, the Parliament passed a revised Penal Code containing anti-trafficking provisions; the Code was officially enacted in January 2010. Under Article 151 of the new provisions, the prescribed penalty for human trafficking ranges from five to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment; however, when a child is the victim of sex trafficking or forced labor similar to slavery, the penalty is life imprisonment with hard labor. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses, such as rape. Articles 7 and 8 of the January 2009 Labor Code prohibit forced and bonded labor and prescribe penalties of five to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment. These provisions, however, are rarely enforced and no cases of suspected human trafficking offenses were investigated or prosecuted during the reporting period. Protection The government provided minimal protective assistance to trafficking victims during the reporting period. An extreme shortage of resources leaves responsible Central African officials unable to implement many basic victim protection services. While the Ministry of Family and Social Affairs continued operation of a shelter (the Center for Mothers and Children) in Bangui for children in distress, some of whom may have been trafficking victims, the shelter often did not have space available to take on additional clients. The government did not establish a system for identifying victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations, and they lacked capacity to provide funding or in-kind support to local or foreign partners for services provided to victims. The government sustained its partnership with UNICEF and UNICEF's two program implementers for the latter‚Äôs protection of demobilized child soldiers, some of whom had likely been subjected to unlawful conscription. For example, during the reporting period, the Sous Prefets of Paoua and Bocaranga facilitated communication between two international NGOs and the APRD, which enabled the effective demobilization of 623 child soldiers from the rebel group. The Ministry of Education‚Äôs local representative in Bocaranga welcomed the demobilized children into the school, despite local suspicions. In September 2009, the Minister of Interior traveled to Paoua, in partnership with police, and convinced local citizens to peaceably allow the continuation of one NGO‚Äôs program to demobilize and rehabilitate child soldiers, including those unlawfully conscripted, from the APRD. In January 2010, the Deputy Minister of Defense tasked a senior gendarmerie official with investigating the situation of the recruitment and use of child soldiers in government- supported self-defense militias, with an eye to ending the practice immediately; the outcome of this investigation is unknown. The Ministry of Justice ensured that identified victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. It claimed to encourage victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers, and to file suits against them for damages; these options do not appear to have been used during the reporting period. The government does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution, and does not offer assistance to its own nationals who are repatriated as victims of trafficking. Prevention The government acknowledged that human trafficking is a problem in the country, and undertook few anti-trafficking prevention efforts during the reporting period. Most visibly, officials launched a human trafficking awareness campaign in June 2009 to coincide with the annual Day of the African Child, though there was limited follow-up on the themes presented after the day of the event. In January 2010, the Minister of Interior spoke on national radio about the overall poor law and order situation in the country, referencing in particular problems of child trafficking. The Inter-Ministerial Committee to Fight Child Exploitation, which was suspended by the Minister of Justice in early 2008 pending a review of the draft Family Code to ensure the legislation authorized the existence of such a committee, was not reinstituted in 2009. The government did not take any measures to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts during the year.

During his early career he was elected to the Florida Senate and California State Senate. Tweed then moved to Arizona Territory and was appointed to serve two terms as an Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. Background Tweed was born in South Reading, Massachusetts, to Joshua and Elizabet (Pratt) Tweed on December 24, 1813, the youngest of four sons. His father was a shoemaker and influential member of the community. He received a liberal education that included a study of the law. Shortly after he was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, he moved to Florida in the hope it would help his first wife's health. There in 1848, as a member of the Whig Party, he was elected to a single term in the Florida Senate.  California  In late 1849 Tweed joined the California Gold Rush, traveling in a group that crossed from Veracruz, Veracruz to San Blas Atempa before continuing north to California. After setting up a legal practice in Sacramento, he was elected a member of the city council on April 1, 1850. Following Sacramento, Tweed moved and lived for a time in Auburn, Dutch Flat, and Nevada City. In 1859, he moved to Charlestown, Massachusetts but returned to Nevada City in 1862. Running as a Republican, Tweed was elected district Attorney of Placer County in 1863. In 1867 he was a delegate to the California Republican Convention. Later that year, Tweed won election to the California State Senate, representing Placer County for two consecutive terms. There he became a leader of the Radical Republicans. Tweed was also an advocate of women's rights. On January 10, 1870, the Republican senator introduced a bill that would allow the state to hire women for the same wages offered to their male coworkers. The bill was defeated in a senate vote of 15-21. Later that session Tweed submitted a petition to amend the state constitution to grant women's suffrage. He was appointed chairman of a special committee established to investigate the possibility. Although the committee reported favorably, the proposal was defeated by a vote of 23-47. Arizona Territory The \\"Judge Charles A. Tweed House\\", built in 1880 and located at 1611 W. Filmore St. On April 14, 1870, following Judge John Titus' promotion to Chief Justice, Tweed was appointed an Associate Justice to the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. The new justice moved to Prescott in August and presided over his first district court session on October 3, 1870. Press reports of the new justice's performance were favorable with one newspaper reporting, \\"Judge Tweed has gained the confidence of the people ... by giving the law a literal construction and showing a disposition to get at the rights of matters, irrespective of technicalities.\\" On October 2, 1871, Tweed's first wife, Ruth G., died. The 1871 session of the Arizona Territorial Legislature created Maricopa County and placed it within Tweed's judicial district. Early in 1872, Tweed moved to the seat of the new county, Phoenix. There he purchased some land where members of his family grew alfalfa, corn, peaches, and operated a dairy farm. In addition to his judicial duties, Tweed became active in early efforts to use the Salt River for irrigation. On March 31, 1875, Tweed married Minnie A. Jackson. The marriage ended with her death on March 14, 1877. Judge Tweed's third marriage came on March 20, 1878 when he wed Marcia C. Lewis of San Francisco. In Phoenix, Judge Tweed remained as popular as he had been in Prescott. As a result, he was appointed to a second term in March 1874. This term saw charges raised against the judge, possibly by unhappy litigants, that Tweed drank to excess and had become old and feeble. Territorial Governors Anson P.K. Safford, John Philo Hoyt, Chief Justice C. G. W. French, and Edmund W. Wells were among Tweed's defenders and the charges were dismissed in 1876. The claims may however have influenced President Rutherford B. Hayes to not appoint Tweed to a third term in 1878. After leaving the bench, Tweed moved to Mineral Park and served as counsel for a mining company. In November 1878 he was elected Mohave County attorney beginning in January the next year. Tweed resigned in mid-1880 to return to Phoenix. There he made unsuccessful runs to become Maricopa County attorney in 1880 and 1882. The judge's later years were spent in a law partnership with William A. Hancock. Tweed had been in declining health for years. In early 1887, he traveled to San Francisco to seek medical treatment. The treatment was unable to reverse his problems and Tweed died on July 22, 1887. References External links *Charles A.

Background  The Arabs had reached Central Asia in the decade after their decisive victory in the Battle of Nihavend in 642, when they completed their conquest of the former Sassanid Empire by seizing Sistan and Khurasan. Marw, the capital of Khurasan, fell in 651 to Abdallah ibn Amir, and with it the borders of the nascent Caliphate reached the river Oxus (modern Amu Darya). The lands beyond the Oxus‚ÄîTransoxiana or Transoxania, known simply as \\"the land beyond the river\\" (mƒÅ wara al-nahr) to the Arabs‚Äîwere different to what the Arabs had encountered before: not only did they encompass a varied topography, ranging from the remote mountains of the Hindu Kush to fertile river valleys and deserts with oasis cities, it was also settled by a variety of peoples, both sedentary and nomadic, and instead of the imperial administration of the Persians, the region was divided into many small independent principalities. Geographically, politically, and socially, Transoxiana was divided into four regions: Tokharistan on the upper Oxus, surrounded by the Hissar Mountains to the north and the Hindu Kush to the east and south; Sogdia or Sogdiana, to the east of the middle Oxus and around the Zarafshan river; Khwarezm or Chorasmia, on the lower Oxus and its confluence into the Aral Sea; and the lands north of the Hissar Mountains and along the Jaxartes river (modern Syr Darya), including Zhetysu and the Fergana Valley. As today, the population belonged to two broad linguistic groups: the speakers of Iranian languages, who in the 7th century tended to be urbanized, and the Turkic peoples, who at the time were still mostly nomadic. Indeed, the history of Transoxiana had been dominated by the invasions of nomadic peoples from Central Asia. In the 2nd century BC the Yuezhi destroyed the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and supplanted it with the Kushan Empire, under which Buddhism entered the area. The Kushans were succeeded by the Hephthalites in the early 5th century, whose dominance lasted until the rise of the First Turkic Khaganate in the mid-6th century. After the great Khaganate became divided in two, the Western Turkic Khaganate retained its position of overlordship over the various principalities of Transoxiana, on occasion even launching raids as far as Balkh. When the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited Tokharistan in 630, he found no less than 27 different principalities, under the overall authority of a Turkish prince (Shad) at Qunduz, who was the eldest son of the Western Turkic Jabghu. Following the collapse of the Western Turkic Khaganate in the 650s, this viceroy became an independent ruler, claiming the title of Jabghu for himself. The Jabghus maintained some sort of suzerainty over the other principalities of Tokharistan, but this authority was largely nominal, and the local princes‚Äîmany of whom were Turkish chieftains and local governors who had likewise seized authority in the wake of the Khaganate's collapse‚Äîwere effectively independent. North of the Oxus, in Upper Tokharistan, the most important principalities from east to west were Badakhshan, Khuttal, Kubadhiyan, and Saghaniyan. South of the Oxus, in Lower Tokharistan, was Balkh, the ancient capital of the entire region, which remained the most important settlement of Tokharistan and its main religious centre, with the famous Buddhist stupa of Nawbahar attracting pilgrims from far and wide. Important principalities were those of Juzjan, Badghis, Herat, and Bamiyan. Behind these, over the Hindu Kish, lay Kabul. North and west of the Hissar range, along the river Zarafshan, lay the region of Sogdia. This was an ancient Iranian land, with its own culture, language, and script, which are well documented through archaeological discoveries and literary references. Sogdia was likewise split into several small principalities, but the two major centres of Bukhara and Samarkand dominated the rest. The Sogdians were particularly active as merchants in the so-called \\"Silk Road\\". Chinese records seem to suggest that most of the local princes belonged to branches of the same ruling house, and that the head of this house, the ruler of Samarkand, was allied by marriage to the Turkic khagans. Most of these rulers used Persian titles (khudah, shah) but some also had Turkish titles, and the ruler of Samarkand, as the pre-eminent among them, used the Sogdian title of ikhshid (as did the kings of Fargana). Rulership was hereditary, but an important role was played also by the landed gentry (dihqans) and wealthy merchants, who possessed, according to H. A. R. Gibb, \\"not only a large measure of independence but also on occasion the power to depose the ruling prince and elect his successor\\". Ayaz Kala, a fortress of Khwarezm (6th to 8th century CE). To the north and east of Sogdia stretched the so-called \\"Hungry Steppe\\", an expanse of ca. 160 km, which gave way to the fertile regions around the river Jaxartes. The Jaxartes was smaller than the Oxus and easily fordable. The region encompassed the principality of Shash (modern Tashkent) in the northwest, and the Fergana Valley to the east, bordering the Tien Shan Mountains, behind which lay Kashgar, the westernmost outpost of the Chinese Empire. To the west of Sogdia, likewise isolated amidst the desert, lay Khwarezm. It was inhabited by a sedentary, urbanized Iranian people. The history of the area between the late 3rd century and the onset of the Muslim conquest is often unclear due to the lack of adequate literary and archaeological sources. Modern scholars dispute whether the area came under Kushan rule, notably due to the absence of any traces of Buddhism in the area and the continued prevalence of Zoroastrianism; al-Tabari reports that the area was conquered by the Sasanians under Ardashir I (r. 224‚Äì242), and although later Sasanian province lists don't include Khwarezm, the area probably remained in some kind of dependence from Sasanian Persia. From the early 4th century, Khwarezm was ruled by the native Afrighid dynasty, which is known through coins and the narrative of the 11th-century Khwarezmian scholar al-Biruni. It is equally unclear whether Khwarezm came under Turkic dominion in the 6th‚Äì7th centuries. Transoxiana, as Hugh N. Kennedy remarks, \\"was a rich land, full of opportunities and wealth but defended by warlike men who valued their independence very highly\\", and indeed its subjugation would prove to be the longest and hardest-fought of the early Muslim conquests, not being completed until the Battle of Talas secured Muslim dominance over the region in 751.  First Muslim incursions  Male bust from Tokharistan, 7th/8th century CE Although the Arab sources give the impression that the Arabs began their conquest of the region in the 650s, in reality most of the early warfare in the area were little more than raids aiming at seizing booty and extracting tribute. Indeed, Arab presence was limited to a small garrison at Marw, and armies were sent by the governors of Iraq every year to raid and plunder the native principalities. The first expedition, under Ahnaf ibn Qays, in 652, was repulsed by the united forces of Lower Tokharistan, and returned to Marw al- Rudh. A second expedition under al-Aqra ibn Habis however was able to defeat the prince of Juzjan, and occupy Juzjan, Faryab, Talaqan, and Balkh. Detachments of Arabs plundered far and wide, some reaching as far as Khwarazm. In 654, the town of Mayamurgh in Sogdia was raided. Shortly after, however, the local population, led by Qarin (possibly a member of the House of Karen) rose in revolt. The Arabs evacuated all of Khurasan, and according to Chinese sources, the princes of Tokharistan restored Yazdegerd III's son Peroz as titular king of Persia for a time. Preoccupied with the First Fitna (656‚Äì661), the Arabs were unable to react, although raiding expeditions continue to be recorded in 655‚Äì658. After the end of the civil war, Abdallah ibn Amir was again entrusted with restoring Muslim control over Khurasan. The exact events of the next few years are unclear as the historical traditions confuse them with Ibn Amir's original conquest of the area, but what information there is, mostly from tribal accounts, suggests occasional fierce resistance and rebellions, leading to acts like the destruction of the Nawbahar stupa by Ibn Amir's deputy Qays ibn al-Hatham. It was not until the appointment of Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan to the government of Iraq and the eastern Caliphate that the Arabs undertook a systematic pacification campaign in Khurasan. From 667 until his death in 670, Ziyad's deputy in Khurasan, al-Hakam ibn Amr al-Ghifari, led a series of campaigns in Tokharistan, which saw Arab armies crossing the Oxus into Saghaniyan in the process. Peroz was evicted and once again fled to China. Al-Hakam's death was followed by another large-scale uprising, but his successor, Rabi ibn Ziyad al-Harithi, took Balkh and defeated the rebels at Quhistan, before crossing the Oxus to invade Saghaniyan. Other Arab forces secured the crossing-points of Zamm and Amul further west, while the Arab sources mention a conquest of Khwarazm at the same time. More importantly for the future of Muslim presence in the region, in 671 Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan settled 50,000 warriors, mostly drawn from Basra and to a lesser degree from Kufa, with their families in Marw. This move not only bolstered the Muslim element in Khurasan, but also provided the forces necessary for future expansion into Transoxiana. When Ziyad died, his policies were continued by his son, Ubayd Allah, who was appointed governor of Khurasan and arrived at Marw in autumn 673. In the next spring, Ubayd Allah crossed the Oxus and invaded the principality of Bukhara, which at the time was led by the queen- mother, known simply as Khatun (a Sogdian title meaning \\"lady\\"), as regent for her infant son. The Arabs achieved a first success near the town of Baykand, before marching on to Bukhara itself. The local historical tradition records that the Arabs besieged Bukhara, and that the Turks were called for help, although this is missing in the Arab sources, which simply state that the Arabs won a great victory over the Bukharans. Following a practice that was apparently common at the time, Ubayd Allah recruited 2,000 captives, all \\"skillful archers\\", as his personal guard. The fate of Bukhara is left unclear, but according to Gibb this arrangement suggests that it acknowledged some form of Arab suzerainty and became a tributary state. Ubayd Allah's success was not followed up by his successors, Aslam ibn Zur'a and Abd al- Rahman ibn Ziyad, apart from launching summer raids across the Oxus. Only during the brief governorship of Sa'id ibn Uthman in 676 did the Arabs launch a major expedition into Sogdia. According to al-Baladhuri and Narshakhi, Sa'id defeated a local coalition comprising the cities of Kish, Nasaf, Bukhara, and the Turks, compelled the Khatun to re-affirm Bukhara's allegiance to the Caliphate, and then marched onto Samarkand, which he besieged an captured. He then took 50 young nobles as hostages, who were later executed at Medina, and on his return journey captured Tirmidh on the Oxus and received the surrender of the prince of Khuttal. The first Arab attacks across the Oxus ranged as far as Shash and Khwarazm, and were interrupted by the intertribal warfare that broke out in Khurasan during the Second Fitna (683‚Äì692). Subsequent governors, most notably Sa'id ibn Uthman and al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra, made attempts to conquer territory across the river, but they failed.Kennedy (2007), pp. 236‚Äì243 The native princes, for their part, tried to exploit the Arabs' rivalries, and with the aid of the Arab renegade Musa ibn Abdallah ibn Khazim, who in 689 seized the fortress of Tirmidh for his own domain, they managed to eject the Arabs from their holdings.Kennedy (2007), pp. 243‚Äì254 Nevertheless, the Transoxianian princes remained riven by their own feuds, and failed to unite in the face of the Arab conquest, a fact which would be suitably exploited by Qutayba after 705.Litvinsky, Jalilov & Kolesnikov (1996), pp. 456‚Äì457  Umayyad‚ÄìTurgesh Wars  The larger part of Transoxiana was finally conquered by the Umayyad leader Qutayba ibn Muslim in the reign of al-Walid I (r. 705‚Äì715). The loyalties of Transoxiana's native Iranian and Turkic populations and those of their autonomous local sovereigns remained questionable, as demonstrated in 719, when the Transoxianian sovereigns sent a petition to the Chinese and their Turgesh overlords for military aid against the Caliphate's governors. Qutayba's campaigns have been mixed up with a diplomatic mission. They sent to China in chronicles written by Arabs. Documents in Chinese give 713 as the year the Arab diplomatic delegation was sent. China was asked for help by Shah's Prince against Qutayba. The Turgesh responded by launching a series of attacks against the Muslims in Transoxiana, beginning in 720. These incursions were coupled with uprisings against the Caliphate among the local Sogdians. The Umayyad governor of Khurasan, Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi, harshly suppressed the unrest and restored the Muslim position almost to what it had been during the time of Qutayba, except for the Ferghana Valley, control over which was lost. The Chinese and Turks were reported to have come to aid the Sogdians in their war against the Arabs which raised the hopes of Divashtich. After the Arabs seized Penjikent, the rebel leader Divashtich retreated to his fortress on Mount Mugh. Archives in the Sogdian language found at Divashtich's fortress reveal his precarious position and the events leading up to his capture. After Divashtich's capture, the governor of Khurasan, Said al-Harashi, ordered his crucifixion on a na'us (burial mound). Kashgar, Samarkand, Bukhara and Paikent fell to Qutayba ibn Muslim. In response, the Arabs were almost beaten back by the Turgesh, who were partners with the Sogdians. Sulaiman most likely executed Qutayba, who, after seizing Samarkand and Bukhara, had crushed Sassanian remnants and had Khorezmian scholars slaughtered. Ferghana, Khojand and Chach had fallen to Qutayba. In 721, Turgesh forces, led by K√ºl Chor, defeated the Caliphal army commanded by Sa'id ibn Abdu'l-Aziz near Samarkand. Sa'id's successor, Al- Kharashi, massacred Turks and Sogdian refugees in Khujand, causing an influx of refugees towards the Turgesh. In 724 Caliph Hisham sent a new governor to Khurasan, Muslim ibn Sa'id, with orders to crush the \\"Turks\\" once and for all, but, confronted by Suluk, Muslim hardly managed to reach Samarkand with a handful of survivors after the so-called \\"Day of Thirst\\". In 724, the Muslims were defeated by the Turks of the Turgesh as the Sogdians and Turks fought against the Umayyads. The Sogdians were pacified by Nasr ibn Sayyar after Sulu, Khagan of the Turgesh, died. Islam did not widely spread until Abbasid rule. Samarkand was taken by Qutayba after they achieved victory over the army of the Eastern Turks under Kul Tegin Qapaghan Qaghan came to assist against the Arabs after his vassal, the Tashkent King, received plea from the Samarkand Prince Ghurak against the Arab attack by Qutayba bin Muslim. Qutayba's Muslims obliterated and triumphed over the union of several Ferghana states as fierce fighting took place in Sogdian Samarkand and Khorezm against Qutayba ibn Muslim. An easier time was had in the conquest of Bukhara. Under Ghurak, Sogdian Samarkand was forced to capitulate to the joint Arab- Kharazmian and Bukharan forces of Qutayba. The obliteration of idols was ordered by Qutayba along with the construction of a Mosque, 30,000 slaves and 2,200,000 dirhams. Dewashtich's uprising was an example of anti Islamification sentiment felt after the conquest of the region by the Arabs. A string of subsequent appointees of Hisham were defeated by Suluk, who in 728 took Bukhara and later on still inflicted tactical defeats such as the Battle of the Defile upon the Arabs. The Turgesh state was at its apex, controlling Sogdiana and the Ferghana Valley. By 732, two large Arab expeditions to Samarkand managed, if with heavy losses, to reestablish Caliphal authority in the area; Suluk renounced his ambitions over Samarkand and abandoned Bukhara, withdrawing north. In 734 an early Abbasid follower, al-Harith ibn Surayj, rose in revolt against Umayyad rule and took Balkh and Marv before defecting to the Turgesh three years later, defeated. In winter 737, Suluk along with his allies al-Harith, Gurak (a Turco-Sogdian leader) and men from Usrushana, Tashkent and Khuttal launched a final offensive. He entered Jowzjan but was defeated by the Umayyad governor Asad at the Battle of Kharistan. Next year, Suluk was murdered by his general with Chinese support. Then in 739 the general himself was killed by the Chinese and the Chinese power returned to Transoxiana. Much of the culture and heritage of the Sogdians was lost due to the war. Geographic names used by Muslims contained reminders of the Sogdians. The role of lingua franca that Sogdian originally played was succeeded by Persian after the arrival of Islam.  Umayyad-Tang dynasty China wars  Arab sources claim Qutayba ibn Muslim briefly took Kashgar from China and withdrew after an agreement but modern historians entirely dismiss this claim. The Arab Umayyad Caliphate in 715 AD desposed Ikhshid, the king the Fergana Valley, and installed a new king Alutar on the throne. The deposed king fled to Kucha (seat of Anxi Protectorate), and sought Chinese intervention. The Chinese sent 10,000 troops under Zhang Xiaosong to Ferghana. He defeated Alutar and the Arab occupation force at Namangan and reinstalled Ikhshid on the throne.*Bai, Shouyi et al. (2003). A History of Chinese Muslim (Vol.2). Beijing: Zhonghua Book Company. ., pp. 235‚Äì236 General Tang Jiahui led the Chinese to defeat the following Arab-Tibetan attack in the Battle of Aksu (717). The attack on Aksu was joined by Turgesh Khan Suluk. Both Uch Turfan and Aksu were attacked by the Turgesh, Arab, and Tibetan force on 15 August 717. Qarluqs serving under Chinese command, under Arsila Xian, a Western Turkic Qaghan serving under the Chinese Assistant Grand Protector General Tang Jiahui defeated the attack. Al- Yashkuri, the Arab commander and his army fled to Tashkent after they were defeated.  Last battles  Samarra, Baghdad, Nishapur and Merv were destinations for Sogdians who worked for the Abbasids and became Muslims. The coming to power of the Abbasids resulted in the local Sogdian rulers being relocated from the area to become the Caliph's officers. The last major victory of Arabs in Central Asia occurred at the Battle of Talas (751). The Tibetan Empire was allied to the Arabs during the battle against the Chinese Tang dynasty. Because the Arabs did not proceed to Xinjiang at all, the battle was of no importance strategically, and it was An Lushan's rebellion which ended up by forcing the Tang out of Central Asia.ed. Starr 2004, p. 39.Millward 2007, p. 36. Despite the conversion of some Karluk Turks after the Battle of Talas, the majority of Karluks did not convert to Islam until the mid-10th century, when they established the Kara-Khanid Khanate.Lapidus 2012, p. 230.Esposito 1999, p. 351.Lifchez & Algar 1992, p. 28.Soucek 2000, p. 84. Turks had to wait two and a half centuries before reconquering Transoxiana, when the Karakhanids reconquered the city of Bukhara in 999. Denis Sinor said that it was interference in the internal affairs of the Western Turkic Khaganate which ended Chinese supremacy in Central Asia, since the destruction of the Western Khaganate rid the Muslims of their greatest opponent, and it was not the Battle of Talas which ended the Chinese presence.Sinor 1990, p. 344. = Arab views of the Turks = Medieval Arabs recorded that contemporary Turks looked strange from their perspective and were extremely physically different, calling them \\"broad faced people with small eyes\\". Medieval Muslim writers noted that Tibetans and Turks resembled each other and often were not able to tell the difference between Turks and Tibetans.  Islamization  The process of islamization of local peoples was slow during the Umayyad Caliphate period, but it became more intensive during the following Abbasid period. The Umayyads treated non-Arab peoples as second class citizens and did not encourage conversions, therefore only few Soghdian commoners converted to Islam during their rule.Grousset However, during the Abbasid period non-Arabs gained an equal status and as a result, Islam began spreading across Central Asia. However, the Arab conquest did not mark the end of Buddhism or Chinese influence in the region. The Buddhist Qara Khitai Khanate conquered a large part of Central Asia from the Muslim Kara-Khanid Khanate in the 12th century. The Qara Khitai also reintroduced the Chinese system of Imperial government, since China was still held in respect and esteem in the region among even the Muslim population,Biran 2012, p. 90.Biran 2012, p. 90. and the Kara-Khitans used Chinese as their main official language.Pozzi & Janhunen & Weiers 2006, p. 114. The Kara-Khitan rulers were called \\"the Chinese\\" by Muslim authors.Biran 2005, p. 93.  Writings about China  Muslim writers like Marwazƒ´ and Mahmud KashghƒÅrƒ´ had more up to date information about China in their writings. China was called by the Turks after the Toba rulers of the Northern Wei, and was pronounced by them as TamghƒÅj, TabghƒÅj, TafghƒÅj or TawjƒÅch. India introduced the name \\"Maha Chin\\" (greater China) which caused the two different names for China in Persian as \\"chƒ´n\\" and \\"mƒÅchƒ´n\\" (⁄ÜŸäŸÜ ,ŸÖÿß⁄ÜŸäŸÜ), corresponding to Arabic ·π£ƒ´n and mƒÅ·π£ƒ´n (ÿµŸäŸÜ ŸÖÿßÿµŸäŸÜ). The two terms originally referred to, respectively, Southern and Northern China, but later the definition switched and the south was referred to as \\"Machin\\" and the north as \\"Chin\\". Tang China had controlled Kashgar since the Anxi protectorate's \\"Four Garrisons\\", and this led writers like KashghƒÅrƒ´ to place Kashgar within the definition of China (·π¢ƒ´n). Yugur (yellow Uighurs or Western Yugur) and Khitai or Qitai were all classified as \\"China\\" by Marwazƒ´ while he wrote that ·π¢ƒ´n was bordered by Ma·π£ƒ´n. Another spelling was \\"Mahachin\\".Cordier, Henri. \\"China\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 14 Sept. 2015 . Muslim writers like Marwazƒ´ wrote that Transoxania was a former part of China, retaining the legacy of Tang Chinese rule over this area. Muslim writers viewed the Khitai, the Gansu Uyghur Kingdom and Kashgar as all part of \\"China\\" culturally and geographically with the Muslim Central Asians retaining the legacy of Chinese rule in Central Asia by using titles such as \\"Khan of China\\" (ÿ™ŸÖÿ∫ÿßÿ¨ ÿÆÿßŸÜ) (Tamghaj Khan or Tawgach) in Turkic and \\"the King of the East in China\\" (ŸÖŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ÿ±ŸÇ (ÿ£Ÿà ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ±ŸÇ) ŸàÿßŸÑÿµŸäŸÜ) (malik al-mashriq (or al-sharq) wa'l-·π£ƒ´n) in Arabic for the Muslim Kara-Khanid rulers and their Karluk ancestors. The title \\"Malik al-Mashriq wa'l-·π¢ƒ´n\\" was bestowed by the Abbasid Caliph upon the Tamghaj Khan, the Samarkand Khaqan Y≈´suf b. ·∏§asan. Thenceforth, the title Tamghaj Khan appeared in coins and writings, continuing to be used by the Eastern and Western Kara-Khanid rulers: the Kara-Khitan's usage of Chinese items such as coins, writing system, tablets, seals, art products like porcelein, mirrors, jade and other Chinese customs aimed to appeal to the local Central Asian Muslim population, who regarded Central Asia as former Chinese territories and viewed links with China as prestigious. \\"Turkestan\\" and \\"Chƒ´n\\" (China) were identified with each other by Fakhr al-Dƒ´n MubƒÅrak ShƒÅh with China being identified as the country where the cities of BalƒÅsƒÅgh≈´n and Kashghar were located. Although in modern Urdu \\"Chin\\" means China, this term referred to Central Asia in Muhammad Iqbal's time, which is why Iqbal wrote that \\"Chin is ours\\" (referring to the Muslims) in his song \\"Tarana-e-Milli\\".See also, Iqbal: Tarana-e-Milli, 1910. Columbia University, Department of South Asian Studies. Aladdin, an Arabic Islamic story which is set in China, may have been referring to Central Asia. In the Persian epic Shahnameh Chin and Turkestan are regarded as the same entity, and the Khan of Turkestan is called the Khan of Chin.

The country's trafficking problem is primarily internal and frequently involves parents entrusting children to relatives or intermediaries in return for promises of education, apprenticeship, goods, or money; selling or bartering children into involuntary domestic servitude or herding is used as a means of survival by families seeking to reduce the number of mouths to feed. Child trafficking victims are primarily subjected to forced labor as herders, domestic servants, agricultural laborers, or beggars. Child cattle herders follow traditional routes for grazing cattle and at times cross ill-defined international borders into Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR), and Nigeria. Underage Chadian girls travel to larger towns in search of work, where some are subsequently subjected to prostitution. Some girls are compelled to marry against their will, only to be forced by their husbands into involuntary domestic servitude or agricultural labor. In past reporting periods, traffickers transported children from Cameroon and the CAR to Chad's oil producing regions for commercial sexual exploitation; it is unknown whether this practice persisted in 2009. During the reporting period, the Government of Chad actively engaged in fighting with anti-government armed opposition groups. Each side unlawfully conscripted, including from refugee camps, and used children as combatants, guards, cooks, and look-outs. The government's conscription of children for military service, however, decreased by the end of the reporting period, and a government-led, UNICEF-coordinated process to identify and demobilize remaining child soldiers in military installations and rebel camps began in mid-2009. A significant, but unknown number of children remain within the ranks of the Chadian National Army (ANT). Sudanese children in refugee camps in eastern Chad were forcibly recruited by Sudanese rebel groups, some of which were backed by the Chadian government during the reporting period. The government does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the reporting period, the government took steps to investigate and address the problem of forced child labor in animal herding. It also initiated efforts to raise awareness about the illegality of conscripting child soldiers, to identify and remove children from the ranks of its national army, and to demobilize children captured from rebel groups. The government failed, however, to enact legislation prohibiting trafficking in persons and undertook minimal anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts and victim protection activities. The country faces severe constraints including lack of a strong judicial system, destabilizing civil conflicts, and a heavy influx of refugees from neighboring states.\\"Chad\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. History The practice of slavery in Chad, as in the Sahel states in general, is an entrenched phenomenon with a long history, going back to the Arab slave trade in the Sahelian kingdoms, and it continues today. As elsewhere in West Africa, the situation reflects an ethnic, racial and religious rift between black, Christian farmers and lighter-skinned, Muslim herdsmen, occasionally flaring up in eruptions of violence or civil unrest. In the early 1890s, French military expeditions sent to Chad encountered the forces of Rabih az-Zubayr, who had been conducting slave raids (razzias) in southern Chad throughout the 1890s and had sacked the settlements of Bornu, Baguirmi, and Ouaddai. After years of indecisive engagements, French forces finally defeated Rabih az-Zubayr at the battle of Kouss√©ri in 1900. The colonial authorities of French Chad officially suppressed slavery, but their de facto control over the region was limited. In the huge Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region, the handful of French military administrators soon reached a tacit agreement with the inhabitants of the desert; as long as caravan trails remained relatively secure and minimal levels of law and order were met, the military administration (headquartered in Faya Largeau) usually left the people alone. In central Chad, French rule was only slightly more substantive. Slave raids continued in the 1920s, and it was reported in 1923 that a group of Senegalese Muslims on their way to Mecca had been seized and sold into slavery. Unwilling to expend the resources required for effective administration, the French government responded with sporadic coercion and a growing reliance on indirect rule through the sultanates. Today, in the Republic of Chad, slavery persists, but it does not have the same ubiquity as in the western Sahel, e.g. in Mauritania where up to 20% of total population are estimated as living in slavery. Instead, contemporary slavery in Chad is mostly limited to child labour, and not to hereditary servitude. Child slavery Child slaves, sold by their impoverished parents, are mostly held by Arab-Berber herdsmen. These often impose a new identity on them, :\\"The Arab herdsman change their name, forbid them to speak in their native dialect, ban them from conversing with people from their own ethnic group and make them adopt Islam as their religion.\\" Chad: Children sold into slavery for the price of a calf, IRIN (Integrated Regional Information Networks) of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 21 December 2004. Prosecution Chad's weak judicial system impeded its progress in undertaking anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts. The government failed to prosecute trafficking offenses and convict and punish trafficking offenders during the year. Existing laws do not specifically address human trafficking, though forced prostitution and many types of labor exploitation are prohibited. Title 5 of the Labor Code prohibits forced and bonded labor, prescribing fines of $100 to $1,000; these penalties, which are considered significant by Chadian standards, fail to prescribe a penalty of imprisonment and are not sufficiently stringent to deter trafficking crimes. Penal Code Articles 279 and 280 prohibit the prostitution of children, prescribing punishments of 5 to 10 years' imprisonment and fines up to $2,000 ‚Äì penalties that are sufficiently stringent, but not commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Pimping and owning brothels are also prohibited under Penal Code Articles 281 and 282. The 1991 Chadian National Army Law prohibits the Army's recruitment of individuals below the age of 18. In 2009, the Ministry of Justice, with support from UNICEF, completed drafting revisions to the penal code; several new provisions will prohibit and prescribe punishments for child trafficking and provide protection for victims. The revisions are pending approval by the Supreme Court and the secretary general of the government. The government did not make anti-trafficking law enforcement statistics available, and there is no evidence to suggest the government prosecuted trafficking offenses during the reporting period. It did not provide information on the status of pending cases reported in the previous reporting period. In past reporting periods, the government prosecuted a small number of child trafficking cases using laws against kidnapping, the sale of children, and employing children under 14 years of age, though most magistrates lack understanding of how to apply existing laws to trafficking cases. During the year, police detained an unknown number of Chadian adults suspected of using forced child labor for herding, as well as intermediaries arranging herding jobs for children, but released all suspects after they paid small fines. Some cases were dealt with by traditional forms of justice which varied depending on the religion, ethnicity, and clan affiliation of all parties involved in or affected by the exploitation. The government did not prosecute military officials for conscripting child soldiers, though it notified the ANT during the year that future infractions would be punished with the full weight of the law. Protection The Government of Chad did not take adequate steps to ensure that all victims of trafficking received access to protective services during the reporting period. It did, however, make progress in providing protection for child soldiers, some of whom may have been forcibly conscripted, identified within the country. In a June 2009 ceremony, the ANT transferred to UNICEF for care 84 child combatants captured from Chadian rebel groups in early May. In July 2009, representatives of the Ministries of Social Affairs, Defense, and Foreign Affairs led an inter- ministerial mission to the military camp in Moussoro, accompanied by staff from UNICEF and an international NGO, to identify child soldiers captured from rebel units; of the 88 presumed child soldiers, the team identified 51 as children and succeeded in removing 16 of them to UNICEF's care. By the end of 2009, the government and UNICEF identified and transferred to NGO-run rehabilitation and vocational training centers one child soldier from Chadian military ranks and 239 from Chadian rebel groups. The Ministry of Social Action operated a transit center located in Moussouro to screen and provide shelter to demobilized children after they are first released from armed groups. After spending between two days and two weeks at the center, the government transferred the children to rehabilitation centers operated by international NGOs. During the year, the Ministries of Social Affairs and Defense began maintaining files on rehabilitated child soldiers and other child victims of trafficking. The government provided few services for trafficking victims other than unlawfully conscripted child soldiers during the reporting period. In 2009, the government continued its efforts to provide minimal assistance to child trafficking victims through its six technical regional committees charged with addressing the worst forms of child labor. These committees ‚Äì located in N'Djamena, Abeche, and southern towns, with representatives from the Ministries of Justice, Social Affairs and Family, Education, Public Works, Human Rights, and the Judicial Police ‚Äì encouraged victims to file charges against and assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. They also referred cases of children forced to herd animals to the judiciary for action. The government sustained a formal system for officials to refer victims to NGOs or international organizations for care; judiciary police or other local authorities are to notify the Ministry of Justice's Child Protection Department, UNICEF, and local NGOs when there is a potential case of child trafficking. The government provided no information, however, on the number of victims it referred to such organizations during the year. Officials did not report encouraging victims to file charges or assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. The government did not arrest or detain trafficking victims, or prosecute or otherwise penalize identified child victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Due to weak state entities and a lack of capacity, the government did not allocate any resources for training its officials regarding the identification and treatment of trafficking victims during the reporting period. Prevention The Chadian government made modest efforts to prevent human trafficking during the year. The government continued to conduct its trafficking efforts according to two internal documents that are annually reviewed and revised ‚Äì the \\"Guide for the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking\\", and the \\"Integrated Action Plan to Fight the Worst Forms of Child Labor, Exploitation, and Trafficking (2008-1010)\\" ‚Äì developed by the National Committee to Fight Trafficking and the Directorate of Children in the Ministry of Justice, respectively. While neither plan was formally adopted or launched as originally intended, all relevant government entities follow the work plans outlined in each. The government focused its prevention activities principally on addressing child labor trafficking, as children are the largest group of trafficking victims in Chad. Throughout 2009, an inter-ministerial team visited southern towns to investigate suspected cases of children forced to herd animals and provided a report with recommendations for future action to the Human Rights Ministry. During the year, the government, in partnership with UNICEF and UNFPA, launched several nationwide human rights campaigns that included sensitization for the population on the dangers of giving, renting, or selling one's children into animal herding; these campaigns involved public events, billboards, posters, and the distribution of informational materials. The government also drafted a plan to educate parents on the risks of selling their children; the plan awaits final approval from the Prime Minister and funding. In January 2010, the National School of Administration and Magistracy graduated its first class of 28 labor inspectors; they have not yet been deployed due to lack of funding. The country's 25 existing inspectors and 59 assistance inspectors lacked the resources to fulfill their mandate and the Ministry of Labor provided no information on the number of child labor inspections carried out or the number of children, if any, removed or assisted as the result of such inspections. Beginning in August 2009, the Ministry of Foreign Affair's Military Coordinator led an awareness raising delegation composed of officers from the ANT, the Nomadic Guard, Directorate General of Security Services for National Institutions, and the Gendarmerie, along with civilian government officials and representatives of UNICEF, UNDP, the UN peacekeeping operation, and diplomatic missions, to the four headquarters locations of the government's armed forces in Abeche, N'Djamena, Moussoro, and Mongo. The Military Coordinator, a brigadier general, delivered a consistent message denouncing the use of child soldiers, outlining the government's intolerance of the practice, and stating that the government would investigate and prosecute anyone implicated in the use of child soldiers. The government made no effort to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor during the reporting period. In July 2009, the government ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Women and children from China are trafficked to Africa, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America, predominantly Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan for commercial sexual exploitation and forced labour. Women and children from Myanmar, Vietnam, Mongolia, former USSR (except for Baltic States), North Korea, Romania, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and Ghana are trafficked to China for commercial sexual exploitation and forced labour. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017.  Definition  According to the United Nations Palermo Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons of 2000, as part of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, human trafficking involves \\"recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons\\" by \\"the use of force or other means of coercion\\" with the \\"purpose of exploitation\\". The Protocol further explains \\"exploitation\\" as, at a minimum, \\"the sex work of others\\" and \\"other forms of sexual exploitation\\". A person is considered a \\"trafficked victim if he or she is involved in the above-mentioned situations, regardless of whether the person consents to it or not.\\"  Extent  A global map of human trafficking. The United Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking reports that around 600,000 migrant workers leave China annually to work overseas. This number accounts for those tracked by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and does not include those who leave without documents. Perhaps up to 90% of the migrant workers are migrating through unregulated and uninformed channels. The number of female migrants is also rising rapidly, most of whom are young girls aged 17‚Äì25. It has been suggested that cross-border trafficking of women is increasing in China. Undocumented migrants who are trafficked into China mainly come from Vietnam, Russia, North Korea and Myanmar. The UNIAP states that many individuals have been trafficked from southwest China though Myanmar and eventually into countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The trafficking of individuals across countries has a wide array of purposes, ranging from commercial sexual exploitation and forced marriage to illegal adoption, forced labour, and begging. For example, of the 8,000 Vietnamese women married to Chinese men in Guangxi province between 1989 and 1999, some were introduced by friends and relatives, and most were found to have been trafficked. =Reports on Human Trafficking= According to a UNIAP study on the reports of human trafficking in China, there were 800 reported human trafficking cases reported in the print media between 2006 and 2007. The study found correlations between factors like age and gender with different types of human trafficking. For example, trafficking of young boys for adoption, and girls and young women for sexual exploitation were different instances of human trafficking that had a positive correlation with another factor. The main means of trafficking involved: fraud and deception, 37%; kidnapping, 26%; abuse of power or a position of vulnerability, 17%; and physical violence, 5%. 58% of the articles reported into which sector victims were trafficked: forced prostitution 19%; the entertainment industry, hairdressing or massage parlours 9%; brick kilns 9%; manufacturing 4%; domestic labour 3%; forced begging 3%; and others 11%. =Geographic Distribution of Forced Laborers= According to the UNIAP report on human trafficking in China, 301 trafficking cases reported by the media from 2007 to mid-2008 were analysed to determine that Yunnan and Guizhou were the main source provinces of human trafficking. Fujian, Guangdong, and Shandong were the primary destination provinces. Henan province is both a source and destination for human trafficking. A correlation has also been found between sources and the destinations for trafficked victims. In provinces with the lowest GDP per capita in China like Yunnan and Guizhou, trafficked victims come from these areas. Provinces with the highest GDP per capita like Fujian, Guangdong, and Shangong, are the prime destinations for trafficked victims because there is a great demand and resources available to utilise forced labourers. China remains a significant source of girls and women subjected to forced prostitution throughout the world. During the year, Chinese sex trafficking victims were reported on all of the inhabited continents. Traffickers recruited girls and young women, often from rural areas of China, using a combination of fraudulent job offers, imposition of large travel fees, and threats of physical or financial harm, to obtain and maintain their service in prostitution. Locations of sex trafficking of Chinese women and girls abroad vary widely, and sometimes are collocated with concentrations of Chinese migrant workers in factories, and mining and logging camps. =Major Chinese Hubs for Human Trafficking= Internal trafficking is most pronounced among China's migrant population, which is estimated to exceed 150 million people. Forced labour remains a serious problem, including in brick kilns, coal mines, factories, and on construction sites throughout China. There were numerous confirmed reports of involuntary servitude of children, adults, and migrant workers during the reporting period. As an example, in May 2009, media reports exposed a forced labour case at brick kilns in Anhui province, where mentally handicapped workers were subjected to slave-like conditions. In addition to internal trafficking of the migrant population in China, rampant trafficking is often also attributed to a decade- long one-child policy that resulted in gender imbalance, and a universal expectation to marry. Men in communities experiencing severe shortage of women are under strong pressure to find a bride. When they cannot afford to pay the high bride price for local women, they readily resort to purchasing brides kidnapped from other areas. Popular areas of origin for domestically trafficked brides are the poorer areas of Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou where poverty renders women more vulnerable to trafficking. Traffickers generally sell these women in distant areas, such as Shaanxi, Ningxia, Guangxi, Hainan, and Guangdong provinces with large gender imbalances. Types of Human Trafficking =Child Labour= One demographic particularly susceptible to forced labour is children. The U.S. Department of State has issued a report stating that \\"Chinese children are forced into prostitution, and various forms of forced labour, including begging, stealing, selling flowers, and work in brick kilns and factories; the children of migrants are particularly vulnerable to trafficking.\\" For example, there were reports that child labourers were found working in brick kilns, low-skill service sectors and in small workshops and factories. These reports found that the underage labourers are in their teens, typically ranging from 13 to 15 years old, but some are as young as 10 years old. In another instance, children in Xinjiang were forced to pick cotton as part of a \\"work-study\\" program, according to foreign media reports. They worked long hours and were exploited under this simple guise. Students do not have a voice in raising concerns about how they are employed and have no protection against any abusive work practice or dangerous conditions of being on the job. The overall extent of forced labour and child labour in China is also unclear in part because the government releases only limited information on the subject according to the report on trafficking issued by the U.S. Department of State. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor where China was attributed 12 goods ranging from bricks, coal and cotton to electronics, fireworks and Christmas decorations. =Sex Trafficking= China's legal definition of trafficking does not automatically regard children over the age of 14 who are subjected to the commercial sex trade as trafficking victims. Chinese laws only recognise forms of coercion other than abduction, such as threats of physical harm or non-physical harm, as constituting a means of trafficking. In the United States Department of State report, \\"Article 244 of the Chinese Criminal Law criminalises forced labour, but prescribes punishments of a fine or no more than three years imprisonment, and only if the circumstances are found to be 'serious' - penalties which are not sufficiently stringent.\\" In addition, the definition of trafficking does not pertain to male victims of trafficking or adult victims of labour trafficking. The number of women suffering from sexual exploitation is exponentially increasing. Traffickers usually attract victims through false promises of high salaries and stable job incomes. Many women are deceived because of their poor education and they are often also marginalized minority groups who believe the false promises of traffickers who offer the hope of living an urban life. The problem of sex trafficking stems from the gender imbalance present in China. Women are most likely sold into provinces like Henan in which the gender imbalance is particularly stark and where there is a high demand for women. Often, men kidnap the women after enticing them with promises of employment and money, but later sell them to villages and other provinces. Trafficked women are often then forced into marriage and therefore suffer from prolonged sexual exploitation. Particularly, according to the article on \\"Human Trafficking and Smuggling in China\\" by Cindy Chu, trafficked women were usually aged between 20 and 50 in the past, but \\"recently most of them were under 20 and some were girls as young as 12 years old.\\" =Extraction of Organs= Six-year-old Guo Bin, who had his eyeballs removed due to organ trafficking The buying and selling of organs is prevalent in the black market of China. The organ trade is the trade of organs for organ transplantation. There is a shortage of organs available for transplantation which fuels a thriving black market for organs. Traditionally, Chinese culture dictates that organs should be buried and cremated in order for the individual to be reincarnated as a whole which has led to a dearth of bodies being donated. Therefore, China has resorted to harvesting organs from the bodies of prisoners for the use of organ transplants. According to an organ trafficking paper written by Budiani-Saberi and Delmonico, 11,000 transplants were performed in china using the organs of executed prisoners in 2006. Of the transplants performed, 8,000 were kidney transplants, 3,000 were liver transplants, and 200 were heart transplants. In 2006, the 8,000 kidney transplants alone in China would have accounted for at least 10% of the total number of annual organ transplants done in programs of organ trafficking. However, since China has recently adopted the Human Transplantation Act that bans commercial use of prisoner organs, China has reduced the number of transplants to foreign patients by 50% in 2007. According to a New Yorker Article written by Jiayang Fan, even though China performs more transplants annually than any country except the United States, less than one per cent of the population in need of life-saving transplants receives them (as compared to about twenty per cent in the United States). According to China's Ministry of Health, some 1.5 million people continue to wait for transplants. =Surrogacy= Although surrogacy in China is illegal, it is still a common practice among the wealthy Chinese population. In fact, in the past thirty years, over 25,000 children have been born to surrogate mothers in China. Most of these surrogate mothers are recruited from the countryside and are paid around 140,000 yuan. The couples looking for a surrogate mother go through an unlicensed agency which acts like a middleman that establishes communication with women willing to rent their wombs. The growing demand for surrogate mothers is based upon the fact that many urban Chinese are marrying later and postponing child birth as work demands and the high costs of city living weigh couples down. In addition, vanity may also be involved as women continue to maintain their figures. In particular, couples look for surrogate mothers the year before the dragon so that their children can be born on an auspicious year. Many wealthy couples often hire more than one surrogate mother to ensure that eight babies are born because eight is a lucky number in Chinese culture. In-vitro fertilization also produces a higher chance of having twins or triplets, leading to circumvention of China's one-child policy. This exploitation of women's bodies has called for stricter laws against surrogacy. The Chinese Health Ministry has cracked down on many of these practices and even forced the abortion of the fetuses by the surrogate mothers when discovered. Anti-Trafficking Laws and Policies =Law Enforcement against Trafficking= As human trafficking is a prevalent problem within China, regulations and laws have been implemented in order to prohibit forms of trafficking. The Chinese government ratified the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol in December 2009, which obligates China to prohibit all forms of trafficking and bring its domestic laws into conformity with international standards within 24 months. The U.S. Department of State reported that China had \\"arrested 19 of the country‚Äôs 20 most wanted traffickers and pursuit of criminal networks and organized crime syndicates involved in trafficking.\\" The Chinese government passed a number of laws against trafficking and smuggling. The penalties for traffickers and buyers of the 'human goods' are high and severe. In fact, the laws against trafficking in women in China are as severe as the law prohibiting rape according to the U.S. Department of State in 2001. However, the amount of corruption and weak enforcement by officials have impeded the successful implementation of such laws and programs. In addition, police complicity with smugglers has further exacerbated the problem, leaving women vulnerable to trafficking and forced marriage. =Central Government Action= In a report by the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Justice, details have been provided into combating human trafficking in China. For example, the report states that \\"since combating trafficking in women and children started nationally in 1991, a large number of cases of trafficking in women and children has been solved and handled and offenders severely punished according to law.\\" In 2008, courts nationwide convened to decide 1353 cases of trafficking in women and children which was a 9.91% increase of cases from 2007. In total, from the 1353 cases, 2161 offenders were sentenced, representing an 11.05% increase from 2007. Of those who were sentenced, 1319 were sentenced to more than 5 years of fixed- term imprisonment, life imprisonment, death, representing a 10.1% increase from 2007. In 2009, courts nationwide decided 1636 cases of trafficking in women and children, representing a 20.9% increase from 2008. In total, 2413 offenders were sentenced, representing an 11.7% increase from 2008. Of those who were sentenced, 1475 were sentenced to more than 5 years of imprisonment, life imprisonment, or death, representing an 11.83% increase from 2008.\\" =Organisations against Trafficking= Several organisations within China have dedicated efforts into ameliorating the human trafficking situation. For example, Save the Children is a program that has helped fund research to gain a clearer understanding into issues like migration, trafficking and street children to help promote safer migration. By educating children and young people about the dangers of trafficking, especially in communities of ethnic minorities, they will be better equipped to stay on their guard against trafficker organisations. According to a pamphlet created by Save the Children debriefing the current situation in China, the organisation is \\"helping to build networks that migrants can turn to when they arrive in their destinations.\\" They created a safe migration textbook for children that has been instituted into the education system in the Ping Xiang, Guanzi province. There is also child protection work at children's activity centres in cities like Nanning, Kunming, Shenzhen, and Shanghai with huge migrant communities. Another organization called the All-China Women's Federation which is an anti- trafficking education campaign aimed at educating vulnerable women and children to protect themselves against prevailing social and cultural perspectives that propagate human trafficking. The All-China Women's Federation is also involved in a collaboration project with Vietnam to combat trafficking on the borders. Also, in 2016 TongJuBao.com, a collaborative mutual help model (also referred to sometimes as P2P Insurance) launched a Child Safety scheme intended to mobilise the resources of all member to fund professional rapid investigation support (supporting the family and police efforts) in case a child from the community should go missing. = Pressure from Human Rights/Activist Groups = Countries in ASEAN The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed their first human rights convention in November 2012 and committed itself to a trafficking agreement in 2014. Original ASEAN member countries formed in 1967 included Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand. It has expanded to include Bruenei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam since then along with adding the ASEAN Plus Three of China, Japan, and Korea. These countries are dedicated to the fight against trafficking of people. This includes commitments to work together to prevent trafficking, to identify and protect the victims, and to ensure that offenders are punished. According to Helen Stacy, director of the CDDRL Program on Human Rights and a FSI senior fellow, human rights issues are becoming integrated into regional discussions on trade and economic development. ASEAN, being a free trade organisation, has taken interest in human trafficking because countries have begun to recognise that if they want to claim national governance credibility, they have to at least acknowledge the problem, sign human rights agreements, and start cooperating with their neighbours in combating human trafficking. One of the primary purposes of ASEAN is to prevent trafficking, protect victims and prosecute traffickers.

Ocsigen is composed of the following components: * A multi-tier extension of OCaml, allowing to implement both the server and client parts of a Web and mobile application as a single program. * A module named Eliom for the creation of dynamic web sites using high-level abstractions. Its goal is to allow the implementation of complex behaviour using only a handful of lines, while ensuring correctness thanks to strong static typing. In particular, programmers may choose a page generation mode which enforces the output to comply with the recommendations of the W3C. This feature relies heavily on the strong static typing features of the OCaml language. Eliom allows for the entire application (both server side and client side) to be written in OCaml; compiling part of the code to JavaScript so as to be executed inside a Web Browser. Client-server bidirectional communication is abstracted away by Eliom. Data exchange between client and server is facilitated by the fact that both are implemented using the same programming language and therefore the same data types. * A JavaScript compiler from OCaml to JavaScript named js_of_ocaml. It makes it possible to run OCaml programs in a Web browser, with portability and without having to install anything. The compilator takes as input language an OCaml bytecode, that is a compiled OCaml program. It allows you to use existing OCaml libraries whose source code isn't available. * A complete and extensible Web server, supporting features such as CGI, a reverse proxy, data compression, and access control.

These women and girls work within Colombia, and are also sent to sex tourism destinations in other parts of Latin America, the Caribbean, Western Europe, Asia, and North America, including the United States. The humanitarian crisis in Venezuelahttps://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend- lines/28197/venezuelan-immigration-to-colombia-is-spiking-here-s-how-duque-is- handling-ithas worsened from 2010 to the present, with almost 1.5 million people fleeing from Venezuela to cities throughout Colombia in recent years. Immigrants in major Colombian cities such as Bogota, Cali, and Medellin find work scarce, and some turn to prostitution as a last resort to feed their families. Within Colombia, some men are found in conditions of forced labor, but the forced prostitution of women and children from rural areas and urban areas remains a larger problem. Individual cases of forced marriage ‚Äì a risk factor for trafficking ‚Äì involuntary domestic servitude, and forced begging have been reported. Some children are subjected to forced labor in mines and quarries, in the agricultural sector or as domestic servants. Groups at high risk for internal trafficking include displaced persons, poor women in rural areas, and relatives of members of criminal organizations. Continued armed violence in Colombia has displaced many in rural communities, making them vulnerable to human trafficking. Guerillas and new illegal armed groups have been reported to forcibly recruit children to join their ranks; the government estimates thousands of children are exploited under such conditions. Members of gangs and organized criminal networks may force their relatives and acquaintances, and displaced persons ‚Äì typically women and children ‚Äì into conditions of forced prostitution and forced labor, including forced work in the illegal drug trade. Colombia is also a destination for foreign child sex tourists, particularly in coastal cities such as Cartagena and Barranquilla. Migrants from South America, Africa, and China transit Colombia en route to the United States and Europe; some may fall victim to traffickers. The Government of Colombia fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons. During the reporting period, the government increased law enforcement actions against trafficking offenders, enhanced prevention efforts, and continued to offer victim services through an interagency trafficking operations center and through partnerships with NGO's and international organizations. The significant number of Colombians trafficked abroad, however, reflects the need for increased prevention efforts and victim services.\\"Colombia\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Colombia increased its human trafficking law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Colombia prohibits all forms of trafficking through its trafficking statute, Law 985, which prescribes harsh punishments. Such punishments are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with other serious crimes, such as rape. In 2009, Colombian authorities initiated 215 anti-trafficking investigations, reported 200 trafficking prosecutions, and achieved 14 convictions, sentencing trafficking offenders to periods of imprisonment ranging from 7 to 27 years. Such results compare to 159 investigations and 16 convictions reported for 2008. Investigations of labor trafficking increased dramatically over the reporting period: in 2009, there were 80 reports of potential forced labor offenses; whereas in 2008, there were two. The government maintained partnerships with foreign governments to repatriate trafficking victims and investigate trafficking cases in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States. There were no corroborated reports of trafficking-related corruption during the reporting period and the government did not convict any officials for trafficking-related offenses. Public prosecutors received training on trafficking issues from an international organization. Protection The government maintained victim protection efforts, both through direct provision of assistance and in partnership with NGOs and international organizations. The government did not appear to employ formal procedures for identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations within the country, such as displaced persons or women in prostitution. Authorities ran an interagency anti-trafficking operations center to refer victims to providers of protective services, as well as to coordinate and track criminal investigation and prosecution of their cases, and collect nationwide information and statistics about trafficking crimes. The government did not operate shelters dedicated to trafficking victims, but referred victims to local NGOs to provide these services. Authorities provided medical and psychological care, access to financial and employment assistance, and information and legal support for judicial processes. The government identified 155 victims of transnational trafficking during 2009, who consisted of near equal numbers of forced labor and sex trafficking victims, in addition to 14 victims who were trafficked within Colombia. The majority of these victims were adults, and the center provided 78 of these victims with services in collaboration with an NGO. Many victims only requested assistance in returning to their homes, and the government provided safe passage for victims returning home. The government encouraged victims to assist in trafficking investigations and prosecutions, and provided housing to victims participating in these efforts through its witness protection program. However, most victims were reluctant to testify against their traffickers due to fear of reprisals or lack of awareness of their status as victims of a serious crime; four victims participated in prosecutions during the reporting period. Consular officials assisted 110 Colombians trafficked overseas during the reporting period: this represents a significant increase in repatriation assistance when compared with the 22 trafficking victims assisted by Colombian consular officers abroad in 2008. The government contracted legal advisors and social workers to help support Colombians abroad. However, victim services overseas are limited to consular districts with at least 10,000 Colombian residents, and are not likely to be available to victims trafficked to isolated locations. At home, Colombian law enforcement authorities encourage victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. There were no reports of victims being jailed or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. While there was no specialized legal mechanism whereby the government offered a visa or temporary residence status to foreign trafficking victims, the government could provide trafficking victims with temporary permission to remain in the country on a case-by-case basis; these victims were eligible to receive humanitarian assistance from the government. Prevention The government continued substantial prevention efforts against human trafficking. In partnership with international organizations, the government launched a new national trafficking prevention campaign targeting young, low-income Colombians, and concluded a campaign from the previous year; both campaigns included TV commercials, radio spots, and print ads. In collaboration with an international organization, the government also launched a pilot program to combat sex trafficking in two high-risk neighborhoods through public awareness events and training sessions for community leaders. Authorities trained 171 journalists in Medellin, Cartagena, and Cali to improve awareness and increase accurate media coverage of trafficking in persons issues. The Ministry of Education introduced a trafficking in persons component into its sexual education curriculum. Through its anti-trafficking operations center, the government operated a national call center, which received 7,801 calls during the reporting period. Most calls were citizen requests for information relating to job offers overseas, though 133 suspected trafficking cases from the call center were referred to police for investigation. The government encouraged more active anti-trafficking efforts at the local level, and two departments implemented anti-trafficking work plans during the reporting period, for a total of 15 departments with such plans. In 2009, the government hosted a national workshop for these departmental committees to share challenges and best practices. Colombian authorities hosted visiting delegations from Trinidad and Tobago, Chile, and Panama, and shared best practices from the anti-trafficking center with these delegations. Article 219 of the Colombian criminal code prohibits organizing or facilitating sexual tourism and provides penalties of 3 to 8 years‚Äô imprisonment, but there were no reported prosecutions or convictions of child sex tourists. No other government campaigns to reduce demand for commercial sex acts were visible during the reporting period, but the government reduced demand for child labor through public awareness and training efforts, often in partnership with international organizations.

The majority of this trafficking is internal, and much of it is perpetrated by armed groups and government forces outside government control within the DRC's unstable eastern provinces. The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. The government did not show evidence of progress in prosecuting and punishing labor or sex trafficking offenders, including members of its own armed forces, providing protective services for the vast majority of trafficking victims, or raising public awareness of human trafficking. In addition, the government's anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts decreased during the 2010 reporting period.  Realms  A significant number of unlicensed Congolese artisanal miners ‚Äì men and boys ‚Äì are exploited in situations of debt bondage by businessmen and supply dealers from whom they acquire cash advances, tools, food, and other provisions at inflated prices, and to whom they must sell the mined minerals at prices below the market value. The miners are forced to continue to work to repay constantly accumulating debts that are virtually impossible to repay. In North Kivu, South Kivu, and Katanga provinces, armed groups and Congolese national army (FARDC) troops reportedly use threats and coercion to force men and children to mine for minerals. A number of policemen in eastern DRC reportedly arrested people arbitrarily in order to extort money from them. Those who could not pay were forced to work until they had \\"earned\\" their freedom. Congolese girls are forced into prostitution in tent- or hut-based brothels or informal camps ‚Äì including in markets and mining areas ‚Äì by loosely organized networks, gangs, and madams. Congolese women and children are exploited internally in conditions of involuntary domestic servitude and taken, in smaller numbers, to Angola, South Africa, Republic of the Congo, and European nations for commercial sexual exploitation. Some members of Batwa, or pygmy groups, are subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude in agriculture, mining, and domestic work in eastern DRC. Indigenous and foreign armed militia groups, notably, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), Patriotes R√©sistants Congolais (PARECO), various local militia (Mai-Mai), the Alliance of Patriots for a Free and Sovereign Congo (APCLS), and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), continued to abduct and forcibly recruit Congolese men, women, and children to serve as laborers, porters, domestics, combatants, and in sexual servitude. In 2009, the LRA continued operations in areas in and near the DRC's Orientale Province, violently abducting more than 1,700 Congolese citizens, including children. Some of these abductees were later taken to southern Sudan or the Central African Republic. Likewise, abducted Sudanese and Central African citizens experienced conditions of forced labor and sexual servitude at the hands of the LRA after being forcibly taken to the DRC. In 2009, the FARDC resumed recruitment, at times through force, of children for use as combatants, escorts, and porters, a practice which observers believed to have ended by 2008. From November 2008 to October 2009, 623 confirmed cases of unlawful child soldier recruitment were attributed to the FARDC, 75 percent of which were attributable to ex-CNDP (National Congress for the Defense of the People, a former Congolese rebel group) elements absorbed into the FARDC in 2009. In April 2009, for example, 100 children, ages 13 to 15, were recruited by the FARDC along the Bunyakiri- Hombo axis. An unspecified number of children recruited by the CNDP during past reporting periods remain within integrated FARDC units. In addition, FARDC elements pressed hundreds of civilians, including children, into forced labor to carry ammunition, supplies, and looted goods, to fetch water and firewood, to serve as guides, or to construct military facilities and temporary huts. Those who resisted were sometimes killed. Others died under the weight of their heavy loads. Elements of the national army perpetrated severe human trafficking abuses in 2010, including forcibly recruiting hundreds of children and using local populations to perform forced labor. Some army commanders blocked efforts to remove children from their units. Furthermore, a number of FARDC commanders accused of child soldiering and forced labor abuses in previous reporting periods remained in leadership positions within the army and were not investigated, disciplined in any way, or brought to trial. Therefore, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is placed on Tier 3. The government continued to lack sufficient financial, technical, and human resources to effectively address trafficking crimes and provide basic levels of security and social services in most parts of the country. The military lacked the capacity to demobilize armed groups or adequately prevent the trafficking violations committed by members of its own forces. The country's criminal and military justice systems, including the police, courts, and prisons were practically nonexistent; there were few functioning courts or secure prisons in the country. Some advances, however, were noted during the reporting period in demobilizing children from fighting factions, including from the national army, and in sensitizing military officials about the illegality of committing forced labor abuses.\\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017.  History  Between 1996 and 2003, the Rwandan Patriotic Front/Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPF/RPA) entered the Democratic Republic of the Congo to kill Hutu refugees and anti-Tutsis who had fled to the DRC to escape the Rwandan Genocide. RPF/RPA was led by General Paul Kagame, who ended the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda. After allying with the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), Kagame was given reason for ‚Äúentree into the DRC for the sole reason of going after Hutu refugees.‚Äù The Tutsi-led armies killed innocent citizens, including women, children, and the elderly. In the First Congo War, the conflict that resulted from this invasion, Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila, leader of the AFDL and opponent to President Mobutu, took power in May 1997. He subsequently exiled Mobutu from the DRC. The desired elimination of Hutus by Kabila was unsuccessful and disliked by Rwanda, which led to the Second Congo War. In 1998, a group of African powers, headed by Rwanda, sought to remove Kabila from power. His assassination in office led to the rise of Joseph Kabila, his son. The war ended with the Pretoria Accords in 2002, signed between the DRC and Rwanda. Since the beginning of the wars, the country has seen numerous human rights violations, as well as human trafficking. In 2011, the United Nations Human Development Index marked the DRC as 187 out of the 187 countries used for calculation.  Gender-Based Violence  From 1996 to 2013, more than 200,000 victims, specifically women and children, were the target of gender - based, sexual violence. More than 8,000 cases of assault from women or girls were reported between January and September of 2008. According to a 2011 report, there is a possibility of over 2 million sexual violence victims across the DRC. Gender-based violence is used as a method of power during times of conflict. Conflict and gender-based violence symbiotically assist in the ‚Äúdestabilization of [a] region and its people.‚Äù The United States Department of State states that human trafficking in the DRC predominantly occurs through the forced prostitution of women and children, child labor in mines, and child soldiers. Reliance on women as providers of survival materials, like water, kindling, and food, makes them more susceptible to abduction. In the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the prominent form of human trafficking is ‚Äúconflict-based sexual slavery of women and girls. Information collected by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo from January 2010 to December 2013 shows ‚Äú3,635 incidences of sexual violence (rape and gang rape) by armed groups and state agents.‚Äù Within those cases, 73% of those victims were women, 25% were girls, and 2% were men. Additionally, almost 50% of the actions were committed by Congolese state agents, and 35.2% of acts within that category committed by FARDC. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) conducted a study that showed that 39% of sexual, gender-based violence in the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, Orientale, Katanga and Maniema, was related to armed conflict and committed by armed people. A survey that was taken from the North Kivu province \\"showed that 22% of women and 10% of men were victims of sexual violence within the conflict.\\" Sexual violence has also occurred between different ethnic communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the Tanganyika province, there has been violence between the militias of the Twa and the Luba. Violence and conflict has moved to the Kasa√Ø province, the Kasa√Ø-central province, and the Kasa√Ø-Oriental province. The anti-government militia Kamuina Nsapu and the pro-government militia Bana Mura‚Äôs targeting of civilians has led to increased sexual violence. Examples of actions committed include ‚Äúvictims being raped in front of relatives, a pregnant woman having her fetus ripped out and at least one victim being forced to perform sex acts on a family member before being executed.‚Äù In 2017, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) confirmed 804 cases of sexual violence (507 women, 265 girls, 30 men, and 2 boys). Of those cases, 72% were found to be a result of non-state armed groups. These groups include the ‚ÄúTwa militia and Tanganyika and the Force de resistance patriotique de l‚ÄôIturi (FRPI) operating in Irumu territory in Ituri.‚Äù On May 1st, 2015, an attack on Kikamba in South Kivu led to the rape of 100 women. In 2017, three cases of sexual violence were resolved within the courts. A FARDC colonel was convicted for ‚Äúcommand responsibility for rape as a war crime‚Äù in the village of Musenyi. A commander in the Forces d√©mocratiques de lib√©ration du Rwanda was convicted for utilizing sexual violence as a war crime in Nzovu. A member of parliament was convicted, along with his militia, for the abduction and rape of 39 children on the grounds of a crime against humanity.  Trafficking of Children  A form of trafficking that also occurs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is child labor in Rwandan-held mines. In the Kivu and Katanga Provinces, mining serves as the main source of production. A 2010 report revealed that, of the 742 people working in or near the mines, 40% of those people were slaves. Within that percentage, some of the slaves were as young as five years old. Additionally, the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) ‚Äúexecuted unarmed children suspected of belonging to the Kamuina Nsapu armed group and supported and collaborated with various proxy militias the recruited and used children.‚Äù Sexual violence is also prevalent within the practice of trafficking children. In 2017, there was an increase in the number of occurrences of sexual violence from FARDC and the Congolese National Police, with many of the victims being children. 41% of the actions committed by members of FARDC and 42% of those committed by Congolese National Police included acts upon children. Prosecution The government made little progress in investigating or prosecuting suspected trafficking offenders during the reporting period. The government's judicial writ did not cover many areas of the country where human trafficking occurs, and it remained hamstrung by a critical shortage of magistrates, clerks, and lawyers. Corrupt officials allegedly embezzled meager financial resources from government agencies responsible for combating human trafficking, further disabling the government from pursuing training, capacity building, or victim assistance. In February and March 2010, the government recruited 2,000 new magistrates, who will be appointed and receive training during the upcoming reporting period. Existing laws do not prohibit all forms of labor trafficking. However, the July 2006 sexual violence statute, Law 6/018, specifically prohibits sexual slavery, sex trafficking, child and forced prostitution, and pimping, prescribing penalties for these offenses of 10 to 20 years' imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for rape. The Child Protection Code (Law 09/001) which criminalizes and prescribes penalties of five to 20 years' imprisonment for child slavery and trafficking, child commercial sexual exploitation, and the enlistment of children into the armed forces ‚Äì was published in May 2009. However, it remains unimplemented and without the necessary budget. During the reporting period, child protection police in Bukavu arrested a Congolese woman for allegedly tricking a 13-year- old Congolese girl into accompanying her to Burundi, where she intended to force the girl into prostitution; police transmitted her dossier to the Bukavu court for prosecution in February 2010. The status of the March 2009 case involving the arrest of a Bukavu nightclub owner for allegedly prostituting 10 girls and seven boys in his facility is unknown; the nightclub has reopened. In June 2009, a military tribunal in Kisangani convicted five Mai-Mai members of, among other things, crimes against humanity; these defendants were also initially charged with, but not convicted of, perpetrating acts of forced labor against local populations. Bedi Mubuli Engangela (a.k.a. Colonel 106), a former Mai-Mai commander suspected of insurrection and war crimes, including the conscription of children, appeared before a military tribunal in early 2010 and remains in detention at Malaka Prison in Kinshasa; the court awaits the conclusion of the investigation before setting a trial date. Unlike in previous reporting periods, the government neither brought charges against nor prosecuted any individual suspected of conscripting or using child soldiers. In November 2009, the UN Group of Experts on the DRC published the names of 21 current FARDC commanders alleged to have committed human rights abuses. 13 are implicated in the unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers and three are alleged to have obtained or maintained the forced labor of local populations. Lieutenant Colonel Jean-Pierre Biyoyo, formerly of the Mudundu-40 armed group and the first person convicted by Congolese courts of conscripting children, has not been re-apprehended since his escape from prison in June 2006 and is currently serving as the Commander of FARDC's Sector 3 of the Amani Leo campaign in Walungu, South Kivu. \\"Captain Gaston\\", an armed group commander allegedly responsible for the mid-2006 murder of an NGO child protection advocate, remained at large in Kitshanga, North Kivu, during the reporting period. His January 2007 arrest warrant has not been executed and, after being promoted by the FARDC to the rank of Major, he is leading a FARDC battalion between Ngungu and Karuba. Protection The government assisted in the identification and demobilization of child soldiers during the reporting period, but offered minimal protection to other types of trafficking victims; NGOs provided nearly all of the shelter, legal, medical, and psychological services available to trafficking victims. The government lacked procedures for proactively identifying victims of trafficking among vulnerable groups or referring victims to protective services. Under the National Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Plan, all ex-combatants, including child soldiers, pass through a common process during which they disarm and receive information about military and civilian reintegration options. During this process, the National Demobilization Agency (UEPN-DDR), in cooperation with the UN Mission to the DRC (MONUC), separated and transported any identified children to NGO-run centers for temporary housing and vocational training. 2,816 children were demobilized from armed groups, including the FARDC, through this process in 2009. With the assistance of FARDC commanders, a local NGO demobilized 119 children from FARDC units in South Kivu during the first quarter of 2010. While some of these child soldiers were part of FARDC forces that were fighting in North Kivu in 2008, most of the children originated from former armed groups that had integrated into the FARDC. While the FARDC high command was generally supportive of MONUC's efforts to remove children from its forces during the reporting period, it lacked sufficient command and control to compel many FARDC commanders to comply with standing orders to release their child soldiers, or to prevent ground troops from recruiting additional children or subjecting local populations to forced labor. Certain FARDC commanders actively blocked efforts by MONUC to separate children from their ranks and some FARDC elements continued to harass, arrest, and physically mistreat children formerly associated with armed groups, including potential trafficking victims. In March 2010, a local NGO trained over 200 FARDC officers on the rights and protection of children in South Kivu; they also educated police, local authorities, and local youth throughout the province on child rights and international and national legislation related to trafficking between January and April 2010. Although the national government did not address forced labor in the mining sector, provincial Ministries of Education in Orientale, Kasai Oriental, and Katanga coordinated with NGOs to reintegrate children working in mines into the formal education system. Katanga's provincial Ministry of Interior continued to provide funding for the Kasapa residential \\"welcome center\\" in Lubumbashi to provide street children, including trafficking victims, with protective services and educational programming. It is unknown whether this center provided protective services to trafficking victims in 2009. Government officials recognized the growing problem of child prostitution in the DRC, though authorities have yet to take concrete action against it. The government did not show evidence of encouraging victims to assist in investigations against their traffickers. It offered no legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries in which they may face hardship or retribution. There are, however, few foreign trafficking victims within the DRC, and the government has consistently allowed for the safe repatriation of foreign child soldiers in cooperation with MONUC. Prevention While the government initiated awareness-raising efforts against human rights abuses, including forced labor, committed by its own forces during the year, it made no significant efforts to prevent other forms of human trafficking. The Ministry of Human Rights drafted, but did not disseminate, a document on the country's current trafficking situation, including challenges to addressing it and recommendations for action. In July 2009, the FARDC's Goma headquarters issued a press statement reminding all soldiers and commanders of their duty to protect the civilian population and noted \\"zero tolerance\\" for human rights abuses, specifically citing the crime of forced labor, among others. The notice warned commanders that they would be held accountable for actions committed by troops under their command; this notice was not enforced with concrete law enforcement action. In April 2010, Major Andoga, of the 1331th Battalion, conducted a sensitization campaign on human rights violations and the military's zero tolerance policy in both Kinshasa and the eastern provinces. Although the National Ministry of Labor is responsible for investigating forced child labor and it employs 150 inspectors nationwide, the ministry did not conduct any forced child labor investigations in 2009. Inspectors often lacked means of transport or resources to carry out their work. The provincial Ministry of Labor in Katanga participated in a tripartite dialogue with unions and mining companies on the effect of the financial crisis on youth labor; the dialogue achieved no meaningful outcomes. Newly established provisional Worst Forms of Child Labor Committees in Katanga, Kasai Orientale, and Orientale (Ituri District) provinces ‚Äì composed of staff from various provincial ministries and community members ‚Äì developed annual work plans for 2010. With UNICEF funding, the members of the Katanga committee researched, drafted, and printed a brochure on its mandate that was distributed to local authorities, religious and traditional leaders, and community organizations as part of an awareness-raising campaign. The Kasai Orientale committee met with the governor and provincial assembly, after which the governor committed the provincial government to fighting child labor and establishing secondary schools. The government did not take any known measures during the reporting period to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts.

Gentle Dalibor) are a Serbian alternative rock band from Vranje and one of the most notable acts of the New Serbian Scene.  History  = 2000s = Formed in Vranje in 1995, and having performed as a highschool five-piece band for three years, the band Ne≈æni Dalibor was reformed in 2000 by the original members Ivica Markoviƒá (guitar, lead vocals), Ljubomir Vuƒçkoviƒá (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Branimir Bogdanoviƒá (drums), with the new member Miomir Stojkoviƒá (guitar). At the time, the three were living and studying in Belgrade, thus Ne≈æni Dalibor became a Belgrade- based band. However, after several name changes and live appearances in Vranje and Belgrade, the band went on hiatus in 2003. Two years afterward, in 2005, guitarist Stojkoviƒá had moved to London and the band was reactivated as a trio during the same year. In January 2007, on the webzine Popboks annual lists, the band had been pronounced the seventh best debut act of the year 2006. During the same year, the band had sent the recordings of their three songs, \\"Znaƒçajan dogaƒëaj\\" (\\"A Significant Event\\"), \\"Kratka ≈°etnja\\" (\\"A Short Walk\\") and \\"Grad jo≈° blista\\" (\\"The City Still Glares\\"), to Ivan Lonƒçareviƒá of PGP RTS. One of the songs, \\"Znaƒçajan dogaƒëaj\\" appeared on the PGP RTS various artists compilation Jutro ƒáe promeniti sve? (Morning Would Change Everything?), featuring the prominent bands of the so-called New Serbian Scene. After the compilation release, the band started performing more often and on March 30, 2007, they appeared as an opening act for Presing on their last concert, held at the Belgrade Dom Omladine. The following month, on April 14, as a part of the Scena U≈æivo! concert series, with the band The Mothership Orchestra, the band held a sold-out concert at the club of the same venue. In the meantime, the band added a live musician Dragan Novkoviƒá as the second guitarist and sound engineer. On January 29, the performance held at the Belgrade club Plasic had been broadcast live by Radio B92 in their show Stand By Live. During the same year, the band had recorded three songs at the Belgrade Technical College studio, \\"Ne vidim gde si\\" (\\"I Cannot See Where You Are\\"), \\"Samo magli\\" (\\"Only To The Fog\\") and \\"Vekovi\\" (\\"Centuries\\"), produced by Boris Mladenoviƒá, were released on the Kultur Akt various artists compilation Zdravo, zdravo, zdravo (Hello, Hello, Hello) in 2008. With Mladenoviƒá as the producer, from March until July of the same year, the band had been recording the material for their debut studio album at the Digimedia studio. Having the work-title Pokidane niti (Broken Threads), the material featured the songs written during the band's entire career, the previously released songs, \\"Znaƒçajan dogaƒëaj\\", written in 1997, \\"Kratka ≈°etnja\\", written in 2002, and \\"Grad jo≈° blista\\", written in 2003. The debut studio album Sredstva i ve≈°tine (Means and Skills), featuring fourteen songs, was released on September 1, 2008 by the independent record label Odliƒçan Hrƒçak, being the first release of the New Serbian Scene edition, made by the label and the Digimedia studio in order to promote the most popular bands of the webzine Popboks section Scena. The material featured the music entirely written by the band themselves and the song lyrics written by Ivica Markoviƒá, except for the tracks \\"Znaƒçajan dogaƒëaj\\", written by Branimir Bogdanoviƒá, \\"Kratka ≈°etnja\\", written by Milan Stojkoviƒá, \\"Pokidane niti\\" and \\"Grad jo≈° blista\\", written by Miomir Stojkoviƒá. In the Popboks album review, the critic Dragan Ambroziƒá in comparing the album with the Eva Braun 1992 debut album Prislu≈°kivanja (Eavesdroppings) stated that \\"No matter if you believe that Ne≈æni Dalibor has created a kind of a \\"sped up Prislu≈°kivanja\\" for the new times or not, it is clear that this kind of elan is here and that it is following such examples of high achievements which happen in unexpected moments, almost unintentionally.\\" In order to promote the album, the band had also recorded a promotional video for the song \\"Ti si sam\\" (\\"You Are Alone\\"). The band had also started a live album promotion and during the rest of 2008 and in 2009, they held a tour including the performances in Novi Sad, Sremska Mitrovica, Skopje, Vranje and Belgrade. In the meantime, in January 2009, the song \\"Ti si sam\\" appeared on the fifth place at the Radio B92 Pop Ma≈°ina best singles of 2008 list, and on the ninth place Studio B Diskomer lists in the same category. The following month, on the Popboks annual critics lists, the \\"Ti si sam\\" was selected as the best single and third best music video of the previous year, and the album Sredstva i ve≈°tine was voted the second best album of 2008. During the same year, in July, the band performed at the Novi Sad Exit festival, sharing the stage with Elvis Jackson and The Buzzcocks and in September at the Jelen Pivo Live festival, before Eva Braun, Veliki Prezir, The Rakes and Echo and the Bunnymen. = 2010s = In May 2010, Sredstva i ve≈°tine was reissued by the Exit Music online record label in mp3 format available for free digital download In July, the band performed at the Belgrade BELEF festival and in November had two appearances in Croatia. In the meantime, the band had been recording the second studio album at the Digimedia studio. In December, a remix of the song \\"Samo magli\\" appeared on the Shpira remix album As I Would Say Two. In January of the following year, Popboks critics selected the fifty best domestic albums released during the previous decade on which Sredstva i ve≈°tine appeared on the twelfth and Jutro ƒáe promeniti sve? on the sixteenth place. On March 24, 2011, the second studio album, Normalan ≈æivot (Ordinary Life), was released by Odiƒçan Hrƒçak, once again produced by Boris Mladenoviƒá. Consisting of eleven songs, the material featured the song lyrics entirely written by Ivica Markoviƒá and the music written by all three members and guest appearances by Marija Jovanoviƒá (keyboards) and Boris Mladenoviƒá (tambourine). In order to promote the release, the band released the single \\"Jeste li poludeli ljudi?\\" (\\"Are You Insane People?\\") for online streaming via SoundCloud. In November 2013, the band released their third studio album, entitled simply Ne≈æni Dalibor, featuring the new members Davor Sopiƒá (organ, synthesizer, tamburine) and Dragan Jovanoviƒá (drums).http://neznidalibor.bandcamp.com/album/ne-ni-dalibor-2 The album was produced by Boris Mladenoviƒá and self-released.\\"Ne≈æni Dalibor - Ne≈æni Dalibor (2013)\\", balkanrock.com At the end of 2015, the band released the single \\"U slojevima\\" (\\"In Layers\\"), announcing their fourth studio album, also entitled U slojevima.\\"Ne≈æni Dalibor u Domu omladine Beograda predstavljaju novi album\\", balkanrock.com The album, recorded in Belgrade and produced by former The Saints member Caspar Wijnberg, was announced to be released during 2016.

Most sources agree that up to 80 percent of all trafficked children originate from Benin, with girls comprising 90 percent of that group. Togo, Mali, Guinea, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Senegal are also sources of victims found in the Congolese Republic. Internally trafficked children represent 10 percent of all child victims, the majority of which originate from the Pool region. Many child victims are subjected to forced labor, including in domestic work, market vending and fishing; girls are also exploited in the sex trade. Child victims generally experience harsh treatment, long work hours, and almost no access to education or health services; they receive little or no remuneration for their work. Other village children, however, live voluntarily with extended relatives in cities, attend school, and do housework in exchange for food, in a traditional cultural and familial pattern that does not entail abuse. The Government of the Republic of the Congo does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. The Senate passed the Child Protection Code in August 2009, which prescribes penalties for trafficking offenders; this law is pending Presidential signature. The government also developed and began implementation of a national anti-trafficking action plan, and the Ministry of Labor investigated nine new cases of child trafficking in 2009. However, eight prosecutions based on child trafficking charges filed one or two years ago remained pending and did not come to conclusion or result in convictions. The government did not identify trafficking victims in 2009. Most of the government‚Äôs anti-trafficking activities remain dependent on international donor funding.\\"Republic of the Congo\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of the ROC demonstrated minimal law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking during the reporting period. The government neither prosecuted trafficking offenses nor convicted trafficking offenders in 2009. The Child Protection Law, which prohibits and prescribes punishment for child trafficking, was passed by the Senate in August 2009, but is still pending Presidential signature. Chapter 2 Article 60 of this law prohibits the trafficking, sale, trading, and exploitation of children, and Article 115 prescribes penalties of hard labor and a fine of between approximately $1,978 and $19,790. Pimping of children is punishable under Penal Code Article 344, but its weak prescribed penalty of up to two years‚Äô imprisonment and a fine is neither sufficiently stringent nor commensurate with penalties prescribed by Congolese law for other serious crimes, such as rape. The trafficking of adults is not covered under Congolese law. The Ministry of Labor investigated, but did not prosecute, nine new cases of child trafficking in 2009. Eight prosecutions based on child trafficking charges filed one or two years ago remained pending, and none resulted in a conviction. The Ministry of Social Affairs sustained partnerships with local NGOs and UNICEF to provide training to 40 of the ministry‚Äôs investigators on recognizing victims of trafficking and to support judicial clinics. In addition, the government partnered with UNICEF to provide training to an unknown number of police officers during the year to recognize cases of trafficking. The government showed no evidence of involvement in or tolerance of trafficking on any level. Protection The ROC government provided minimal protection services to trafficking victims, and did not identify any victims during the reporting period. Investigators employed by the Ministry of Social Affairs reportedly utilized a formal identification and registration process to assist victims of trafficking. The government did not ensure that victims were provided access to care facilities, except through funding of the shelter, Espace Jarot, which provided care for a small number of at-risk children, including trafficking victims; in practice, few victims had access to care facilities. In partnership with representatives of the consulates of Benin, Togo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, police and other law enforcement officials formed a working group to identify trafficking patterns and to facilitate the return of trafficked children to their home countries, but have not yet utilized the group to repatriate any child victims. Foreign victims had the same access to the center as Congolese nationals, though there was no access to legal, medical, or psychological services. Some legal services were available to trafficking victims through six child judicial clinics hosted by staff from the Ministries of Social Affairs, Justice, and Health; trafficking victims may file administrative claims against their alleged traffickers at these clinics. Though there is at least one clinic located in each region run by government civil servants and lawyers, they are neither open on a regular basis nor operate with regular business hours; it is unknown whether these clinics provided legal services to child trafficking victims during the year. The government offers foreign trafficking victims temporary residency status as an alternative to immediate repatriation, but is not known to have used these provisions in 2009. Trafficking victims were not usually jailed or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Some victims, however, were detained, arrested, or held in protective custody, and did not benefit from any formal referral process to institutions offering short or long-term care. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, but many elected not to participate in these law enforcement actions due to fear of possible retribution from traffickers or because they did not consider their offenders as guilty. The government did not provide services for repatriated Congolese victims of trafficking. Prevention The government maintained its efforts begun in 2008 to raise awareness and build support for combating human trafficking in the Brazzaville and Pointe Noire areas. In 2009, the Ministry of Health (MOH), in partnership with UNICEF, launched an anti-trafficking public awareness campaign in Pointe Noire involving not only government officials, but also security and diplomatic staff from the consulates of neighboring countries and leaders from local Muslim and Christian communities. Organizers made full use of banners ‚Äì the most common advertising medium ‚Äì to stress the point that human trafficking is illegal and will be punished. In April 2010, the Minister of Social Affairs and Humanitarian Action co-hosted with UNICEF a conference in Pointe Noire to highlight the problem of trafficking in children. Also during the reporting period, the MOH, with support from UNICEF, also began implementation of the government‚Äôs 2009‚Äì2010 National Plan of Action. Under this plan, UNICEF trained MOH representatives to serve as trainers; these trainers then presented anti-trafficking workshops to local NGOs. The government did not monitor migration patterns for trafficking, and it did not take measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period. The ROC is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Costa Rica is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea making it a source of imports and exports. Costa Rica is approximately 19,653 square miles of land, making it smaller than West Virginia. To a lesser but increasing extent, Costa Rica is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to conditions of forced labor, particularly in the agriculture, construction, fishing, and domestic service sectors. The economy greatly depends on the exportation of bananas and coffee, making high demands of agriculture work. Costa Rican women and children are forced into commercial sexual exploitation due to high rates of poverty and violence. Women and girls from Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Colombia, and Panama have been identified in as victims of forced prostitution. Child sex tourism is a serious problem, particularly in the provinces of Guanacaste, Limon, Puntarenas, and San Jos√©. Child sex tourists arrive mostly from the United States and Europe. Young men from Nicaragua, Vietnam, China and other Asian countries are subjected to conditions of forced labor in Costa Rica.\\"Costa Rica\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). Adults have been identified using trafficked women and children to transport and sell drugs. Neighboring countries and cities are victims as well to forced labor many times trafficked to Costa Rica. Costa Rica is currently a Tier 2 watch list location according to the Trafficking In Persons Report. The Government of Costa Rica does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the past year, the Government of Costa Rica continued to raise public awareness about human trafficking and trained many government officials, investigated allegations, in addition to maintaining limited victim services. However, the government‚Äôs law enforcement efforts lagged with respect to holding trafficking offenders accountable for their crimes and in adequately addressing domestic cases of human trafficking. Recently insufficient funds were seen in distribution of government funded resources that help with trafficking. The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. In 2018, Costa Rica was labeled as a Tier 2 country. A Tier 2 country does not meet the minimum standards required to ending trafficking, but are making efforts.  Background  Costa Rica is located in Central America. The capital of Costa Rica is San Jos√©. The population includes people of European, Spanish, African, Chinese, and Indigenous descent totaling in 4.9 million people. The population includes four fifths of European descent while the other percentage is made up of the indigenous people Mestizos. Mestizos is a mix of European and Indian descent. The languages include Spanish, Limonese, Bribr√≠, Cab√©car, Mal√©ku Ja√≠ka, Boruca, and T√©rraba. The major religion is Roman Catholic. The other religions are Protestant, Jewish, and Mennonite. Costa Rica's economy runs on the agriculture, forestry, and fishing industry. The important goods are sugar, coffee, bananas, pineapples, cut flowers, gourmet coffee, herbs, macadamia nuts, and palm oil. The fishing industry mostly includes tuna, shrimp, and tilapia. The agriculture is the most important natural resource for Costa Rica. One third of workers in Costa Rica are women. Costa Rica's government system includes a President, two Vice Presidents, and a unicameral Legislative Assembly. There are seven provinces in Costa Rica that are divided by districts. The governors are appointed by the President. In Costa Rica there is a single judge or a panel of judges. There are no juries and death penalty in Costa Rica. The age of consent is 15 years old. In Costa Rica, prostitution is legal. Individuals have to be 18 years and older. Prostitutes can be found in hotels, bars, clubs, and massage parlors. Sex workers have to provide proof that they are 18 or older. The government provides identification cards and free medical exams for sex workers. Slavery was abolished by the Federal Assembly of Guatemala in 1882. Slavery was abolished in Costa Rica on April 17, 1824. There were not many slaves when slavery was abolished because there were free slaves. Black slaves were brought to Costa Rica with Spanish conquerors. Slaves would work on cacao and banana plantations. Slaves were used in the construction of the railroad. Women were concubines. Children who were born while their mothers were concubines were set free. Free slaves owned their own farms, worked on building railroads, worked for banana companies, cleared the forest, and migrated to other places. However, they were not considered citizens so they did not have legal rights to their farms. Their lands were taken by White Ticos (Costa Ricans).  Types of Trafficking  Children, men, and women are victims of all types of trafficking. Traffickers look for people who are vulnerable. The vulnerable population may be psychologically vulnerable, emotionally vulnerable, there may be economic issues such as poverty, they may be unsupervised, they may be runaways, they may not speak the language, or they may fear the local law enforcement. These are factors that could lead someone to be in the presence of a trafficker. Traffickers may use physical violence, psychological tactics, dehumanization, threats, manipulation, alcohol, drugs, false promises, or false job ads to seek out trafficker victims and to make them fear leaving. * Debt bondage * Domestic servitude * Forced or unfree labor and labor trafficking * Human trafficking * Indentured servitude * Organ trafficking * Sex tourism * Sex trafficking  Profiling  = Victims = Women and children are trafficked into Costa Rica for sex trafficking and forced labor. Most girls are trafficked from Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and other Latin countries. Men and children are also vulnerable to forced labor, especially in agriculture and domestic areas of Costa Rica. = Offender = In 2016, it was reported that 56% of those who were arrested in South America for trafficking were women while 44% were men. More women are being convicted in South America than men. Prevention Costa Rica Legislative Assembly room The Costa Rican government is working to establish firm foundations and fund other organizations to aid in the elimination and prevention of human trafficking within the country. Starting in 2016, the government donated $1.15 million to create a headquarters for National Coalition against Migrant Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons (CONATT) which will aid in increasing awareness and also house a 24 hour emergency response team and as a short term shelter for victims. While Rahab Foundation, a local organization, is working with police to help train them to recognize the signs of a trafficked victim and help get them out of harms way. Many NGO's are working with the public and government officers to bring awareness through education. According to the Costa Rica Star, a local newspaper, in 2017 the government started providing more of the national budget to NGO's, who work to fight against trafficking. After refreshing government policies, NGOs are responding to victims right away by providing food, shelter, and financial and psychological assistance. However, it has been reported that they do not respond on time nor do victims get the same amount of level of protection. Some other ways prevention is taking place is the government passing laws and other policies to discourage human trafficking acts. The government has passed Law against Trafficking and the 2013 Creation of the National Coalition against the Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Persons to prosecute those who participate in the importing and exporting of persons into Costa Rica for any form of forced sexual work, labor slavery, and/or the trafficking of unlawful organs. By making it illegal and prosecuting offenders, it will aid in discouraging human trafficking due to the fear of consequences. It is believed that Costa Rica can start fixing human trafficking by bringing awareness to it; even their Foreign Ministry officials believe it would be a source of \\"moral power\\" and bring about \\"long- term security\\" on the international trafficking level. In 2017, the government decided to increase prevention efforts by generating a new action plan for the 2017-2022. It contains support to fund another international organization and to propose more anti-trafficking government related activities. = Prosecution = The Government of Costa Rica sustained law enforcement efforts against human trafficking during the reporting period. Article 172 of the penal code, which was amended in April 2009, prescribes penalties of six to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment for the movement of persons both across borders and within the country for the purposes of prostitution, sexual or labor servitude, slavery, forced work or services, servile marriage, forced begging, or other forms of compelled service. This statute also prohibits illegal adoption, which does not fall within the international definition of human trafficking. Sentences may be increased to eight to 16 years‚Äô imprisonment under aggravated circumstances, such as the victimization of a child or a trafficker‚Äôs use of deception, violence, intimidation, or coercion. The penalties set forth in amended Article 172 are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Articles 376 and 377 of the penal code additionally prohibit child sex trafficking, prescribing penalties of two to four years‚Äô imprisonment. Law 8754, passed in July 2009, authorized the use of expanded law enforcement and investigative measures, such as wiretapping and the use of anticipated testimonies, when undertaking human trafficking cases. Insufficient familiarity with the new legislation, however, hindered the enforcement of these laws, and the government continued to use other statutes to prosecute trafficking offenders involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of children. In 2017, it was reported that they opened 26 new cases and prosecuted 39 others dealing with those who trafficked others into the country. The government operated a six-person smuggling and trafficking law enforcement unit, and worked closely with foreign governments in cases of transnational human trafficking. No government officials were prosecuted or convicted of trafficking-related corruption, although during the reporting period one government official was suspended and ultimately fired for his involvement in an alleged forced labor scheme involving Chinese youths; authorities were still investigating the case. For the prostitution and sex tourism laws for visitors, the government claims to offer severe prosecution to those who enter the country advertising and/or encouraging trafficking and prostitution of persons and child. To ensure the safety of child and protect them against human trafficking, the government has the prosecutor's office with a specialized Prosecution Unit against Trafficking in Persons while the judicial investigative police and Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MTSS) works to investigate cases of human trafficking against children. = Protection = The Costa Rican government has continued to ensure trafficking victims received access to a basic level of victim assistance during the reporting period. The government provided some officials with training on how to treat trafficking victims; however, it has been reported that there has been no proactive efforts to search for trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as women or children in prostitution. Although there were no government-provided shelter services dedicated to human trafficking victims, the government referred some victims to basic care at short-term government shelters for women and children. The government often relied on NGO's and religious organizations to provide specialized care for trafficking victims, and there is no shelter nor protection for male victims. Foreign victims were eligible for the same services as Costa Rican citizens. The government‚Äôs ‚Äúimmediate attention‚Äù protocol defined the steps for different government institutions to take to detect, identify, protect and provide integrated assistance to a victim, and the Immediate Action Team provided services to two potential trafficking victims during the reporting period. The government provided some limited legal and psychological assistance, though NGOs noted the need for greater government efforts to reintegrate victims into their communities. The government generally did not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Officials treated some adult migrants as illegal immigrants, however, and deported them without taking adequate measures to determine if they were trafficking victims, and the majority of trafficking victims reported by the government were foreign citizens. Foreign nationals were eligible for work permits or refugee status, and the government had provisions in place to issue a special visa to foreign trafficking victims, though no victims received any of the above during the reporting period. A new immigration law, effective March 2010, authorizes temporary residency status specifically for foreign trafficking victims. Costa Rican authorities encouraged victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders, and the government created an enhanced witness protection program last year for victims of crime, though it was not yet fully operational. In 2017, the Institutional Protocol for the Care of Minors and Survivors of Trafficking in Persons was established to detect a crime. The National Coalition against Migrant Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons (CONATT) provides services for human trafficking survivors. These services include food, housing, financial, legal, and psychological. = Anti- Trafficking Organizations = In 2016, the Costa Rican government joined the Blue Heart Campaign, which was created by the UNODC to aid governments, organizations, and both media and private outlets to reveal, prevent, and fight against human trafficking within countries. Bring awareness and education to the public will aid in the identification and elimination of trafficking within the communities. The following year, 2017, for the 5th time, Costa Rica and Panama paired up together to hold a walk to and from each country that aims to educate and shed light on human trafficking and how citizens can recognize and prevent it within their countries, which is supported by both Costa Rican and Panamainan law enforcement. Another organization working within Costa Rica for prevention of the trafficking of Persons is the Face of Justice Association, where they are training both police officers and politicians throughout the country to educate them on victims of trafficking and on how to recognize and eliminate it. Fundaci√≥n Paniamor is an organization in Costa Rica that was declared a public interest by Costa Rican State by Decree in 1989 due to their strong efforts to provide opportunities for adolescents so they can avoid being trafficked and exploited. Some NGO's currently working within Costa Rica include: Alianza por tus Derecho is an active organization that is aiming to generate programs that promote and validate the human rights children have to eliminate the exploitation and abuse they endure during labor. Some programs they offer include a psychological support system that entails individual therapy and family therapy to rehabilitate their mental health while fixing the social stigma among the family. The government sustained strong prevention efforts during the reporting year, training officials and employing partnerships with NGOs, international organizations, and foreign governments to increase public awareness about human trafficking. The government, in partnership with UNICEF and other international organizations, continued the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let Them Lie to You‚Äù anti-trafficking prevention campaign, which reached a projected fifty percent of the adult and adolescent population between October 2008 and June 2009. The government in 2018 has pledged $25,000 of its budget to go towards this program.

Trafficking within the country's borders is more prevalent, with victims primarily trafficked from the north of the country to the more economically prosperous south. Boys from Ghana, Mali, and Burkina Faso are subjected to forced labour in the agricultural sector, including on cocoa, coffee, pineapple, and rubber plantations; boys from Ghana are forced to labour in the mining sector; boys from Togo are forced to work in construction; and boys from Benin are forced to work in carpentry and construction. Girls recruited from Ghana, Togo, and Benin to work as domestic servants and street vendors often are subjected to conditions of forced labour. Women and girls are also recruited from Ghana and Nigeria to work as waitresses in restaurants and bars and are subsequently subjected to forced prostitution. Trafficked children often face harsh treatment and extreme working conditions. The government of C√¥te d'Ivoire does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these significant efforts, such as the conviction of one sex trafficker, the government's overall efforts to combat trafficking were limited and ineffective; therefore, C√¥te d'Ivoire is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for a third consecutive year. The government remained hampered by the absence of a cohesive government, limited resources, and insufficient knowledge of the human trafficking phenomenon among law enforcement officials and judges. The country has never reported a prosecution of forced child labour in the agricultural sector. Police demonstrated a weak understanding of human trafficking by characterising children found in a brothel raid as \\"voluntary prostitutes\\", rather than presumptive victims of human trafficking. C√¥te d'Ivoire also failed to investigate for a third consecutive year NGO reports that police harass undocumented foreign women in prostitution by demanding sex in exchange for not arresting them.\\"C√¥te d'Ivoire\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of C√¥te d'Ivoire‚Äôs legal statutes do not prohibit all forms of trafficking and there is no specific law punishing such offences. However, Penal Code Article 378 prohibits forced labour, prescribing a sufficiently stringent penalty of one to five years‚Äô imprisonment and a fine of approximately $800 to $2,200. Penal Code Article 376 criminalizes entering into contracts that deny freedom to a third person, prescribing a sufficiently stringent punishment of five to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment and a fine. Penal Code Articles 335 to 337 prohibit recruiting or offering children for prostitution, prescribing penalties of one to ten years‚Äô imprisonment and a fine; these penalties are sufficiently stringent, but not commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offences, such as rape. Ivorian law does not criminalize the trafficking of adults for commercial sexual exploitation. During the reporting period, the government convicted one trafficking offender. A Nigerian woman promised two girls from Nigeria a trip to the United States, but instead transported them to C√¥te d'Ivoire and forced them to engage in prostitution 2008 in Vavoua. In May 2009, a court in Daloa convicted and sentenced the trafficker to three years‚Äô imprisonment and a $2,000 fine, and the Nigerian Embassy in Abidjan assisted the victims in returning home. The following child trafficking cases were also identified and investigated by law enforcement agencies during the reporting period. In February 2009, Nigerian traffickers promised jobs in Germany to four Nigerian girls ages 16 to 19, but transported them to C√¥te d'Ivoire and forced them into prostitution in Vaou; the traffickers evaded capture. In June 2009, police in Soubre intercepted 15 Burkinabe children who were being transported by bus to C√¥te d'Ivoire for the purpose of labour exploitation and returned them to their parents; the traffickers eluded capture. In September 2009, a female restaurant owner lured two girls, aged 13 and 17, to Odienne with a promise of jobs, but forced them into prostitution. Gendarmes arrested the restaurant owner, but later released her after she paid a fine of about $100 to the victims‚Äô families. Protection The Ivorian government made inadequate efforts to protect victims of trafficking during the last year. Law enforcement authorities did not demonstrate adequate efforts to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable groups, such as foreign children entering the country without their parents, though some victims were identified during the year. During the reporting period, the government did not offer any specialized training to law enforcement and immigration personnel on identifying and treating victims of trafficking. However, in partnership with the ILO, the Ministry of Family held a workshop for 25 families who volunteered to take in trafficking victims intercepted in their communities. The government had no care facilities for foreign or domestic trafficking victims. There was no witness protection or restitution program for trafficking victims. The government neither encouraged nor discouraged victims from assisting in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offences. The Ministry of Family identified some existing government structures that could be converted to shelters, and in the meantime referred victims to NGOs that offered suitable lodging. While the Ministry of Family and the National Police employed a small team of social workers to assist trafficking victims after they were identified, the government relied on NGOs for medical and psychological assistance to victims, giving the organizations no financial or material support in return. The Ministry of Family had responsibility for seeking temporary residency status in C√¥te d'Ivoire for victims who did not want to return home. During the reporting period, the ministry assisted in the repatriation of 20 trafficked children, including nine from C√¥te d'Ivoire, two from Burkina Faso, three from Benin, three from Ghana, and three from Togo. All of the children had been forced to work in the informal sector. In June 2009, Ivorian police participated in a foreign law enforcement agency-funded raid on farms growing cocoa and palms in the Aboisso area, discovering more than 50 children working on the premises. Ivorian officials determined that four of these children were trafficking victims and returned three to their families, while transferring the fourth to the Ministry of Family for care. Following raids on brothels and bars, police vice squad members asked women in prostitution if they were victims of traffickers, but did not investigate further if the answer was negative. Regulations protected child victims by not permitting police to interview suspected child victims without a case worker present. Child victims were assigned a Ministry of Family case worker with responsibility for informing victims about judicial proceedings, and these case workers allowed children to decide whether they wished to testify against their alleged traffickers. Prevention The Government of C√¥te d'Ivoire demonstrated sustained and modest efforts to prevent trafficking during the reporting period, primarily through public awareness campaigns, which the Ministry of Family estimated reached 11,000 residents of the country. The Ministry of Interior disseminated anti- trafficking awareness materials to police and gendarmes at border points, along with guidance on investigating those who were attempting to bring children into C√¥te d'Ivoire. In an effort to reduce demand for commercial sex acts, police continued periodic raids on brothels and bars suspected of exploiting children in the sex trade. C√¥te d'Ivoire is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Croatian women and girls fall victim to sex trafficking within the country, and women and girls from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other parts of Europe are subjected to forced prostitution in Croatia and in Europe. Men reportedly are subjected to forced labor in agricultural sectors, and children, including Roma, are subjected to conditions of forced begging and theft. The Croatian Government fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. In 2009, the government continued to investigate and prosecute trafficking offenders, increased the minimum imposed penalty for convicted traffickers, and for the first time, ordered a trafficker to pay compensation to a victim. Croatia provided significant funding to NGOs providing assistance and shelter to trafficking victims during the reporting period and continued proactive training and outreach on victim identification. However, the government identified very few trafficking victims in 2009 and failed to protect some victim witnesses.\\"Croatia\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Croatian Government generally sustained its anti- trafficking law enforcement efforts in 2009, though it prosecuted only half as many traffickers as it did the previous year. It continued to exclusively use its human trafficking law to prosecute and convict sex and forced labor trafficking during the reporting period. Croatia criminally prohibits trafficking for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation through Criminal Provision 175 of its penal code. Provision 175 prescribes penalties for all forms of trafficking of one to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment; these penalties are sufficiently stringent and are commensurate with those prescribed for rape. In 2009, the government investigated 13 suspected trafficking offenders, compared with 15 in 2008. It prosecuted six traffickers in 2009, a decrease from 12 prosecuted in 2008. Six trafficking offenders were convicted and given sentences ranging from two to eight years, compared with nine convictions obtained in 2008; however, one conviction was out on appeal and awaited a final verdict. Two of these convictions involved forced labor. The government increased its minimum imposed sentence for all trafficking convictions from one to two years during the reporting period. In the first civil trafficking case, the court ordered the trafficker to pay $28,466 in compensation to the victim. The government continued to provide general anti-trafficking training to police officers, and continued its ‚Äútrain-the-trainer‚Äù program involving 26 police officers training counterparts on ways to recognize and assist trafficking victims. There were no specific reports of trafficking-related complicity during the reporting period. Protection The Government sustained significant efforts to ensure that victims of trafficking received access to necessary care. It continued to fund NGOs as well as its two specialized shelters for adult women and children trafficking victims, totaling $96,461 in 2009. It also provided $45,937 to NGOs to support and assist trafficking victims. Four victims used shelter facilities in 2009. While the government continued to emphasize a victim-centered approach, it identified only eight victims during the reporting period, one more than 2008, but lower than the 15 victims identified in 2007. The government amended its Law on Foreigners in March 2009 to extend the ‚Äúreflection period‚Äù from 30 to 90 days; children continue to be eligible for a stay of 90 days. The government actively encouraged victim participation in trafficking cases and reported that all eight identified victims assisted in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers in 2009. According to preliminary findings released in a January 2010 research project on trafficking and prostitution conducted between December 2008 and November 2009, the Croatian government did not provide adequate protections for some trafficking victims who testified against their traffickers. Researchers reported victims were required to testify repeatedly during trafficking trials; victim‚Äôs testimony can be arranged via video-conference system. The government initiated a pilot assistance program for victim witnesses in four courts in 2009 to improve protections for these victims. Researchers also recommended that the government should intensify efforts to identify adequately all potential victims of forced prostitution. Although victims could be both witness and defendant in some court cases, researchers reported that the government made efforts to ensure that recognized trafficking victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. In response to continued concerns about prostitution and potential trafficking during the high tourist season along the Adriatic coast, the government reported training over 250 police officers in coastal cities during 2009. Although police reported conducting 10 anti-trafficking operations along the coast in 2009, the government did not identify any trafficking victims as a result of these operations. The government provided foreign victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Out of the four foreign trafficking victims identified in 2009, the government repatriated one female to Bosnia and Herzegovina and three to Serbia. Prevention In 2009, the government continued its progressive national-level outreach and anti-trafficking training efforts to raise awareness and prevent trafficking. During the reporting period, it implemented numerous anti-trafficking education workshops and seminars for Croatian authorities, including social workers, diplomatic and consular staff, judges, prosecutors, police, and students, including members of mobile teams responsible for assisting trafficking victims. In November 2009, it organized a seminar for leaders in the tourism industry on ways to identify victims of trafficking. It continued to conduct anti-trafficking training for Croatian soldiers prior to their deployment to Afghanistan as international peacekeepers.

The Government of Cuba does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. In a positive step, the Government of Cuba shared information about human trafficking and its efforts to address the issue. However, the government did not prohibit all forms of trafficking during the reporting period, nor did it provide specific evidence that it prosecuted and punished trafficking offenders, protected victims of all forms of trafficking, or implemented victim protection policies or programs to prevent human trafficking.\\"Cuba\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Government of Cuba  The Government of Cuba did not report discernible progress on prosecuting trafficking offenders during the reporting period. Cuba appears to prohibit most forms of trafficking activity through various provisions of its penal code, but the usage of these provisions could not be verified. Title III, Section 1, Article 310 provides that using children under 16 in prostitution, corruption, pornographic acts, or other illegal conduct may be punishable by from seven to 30 years‚Äô imprisonment or death. Prostitution of children over the age of 16 is legal. Article 316, on the selling of children, bans internal and transnational trafficking in children under the age of 16 for forced labor, prostitution, trade in organs, and pornography, and prescribes penalties of between four and 20 years‚Äô imprisonment. Articles 302 and 87 prohibit inducing an adult into prostitution, and prescribe penalties of up to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment. All these penalties are sufficiently stringent, and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government did not share official data relating to Cuban investigations, prosecutions, and convictions of trafficking offenders in 2009 or any other year. Reports continued of individual police officers profiting from the commercial sex trade, though the practice is officially discouraged. No investigations or prosecutions of public officials have been confirmed. The government did not report any anti-trafficking training provided to officials. However, UNICEF reported that police and workers in the tourist industry received this kind of training. The government also participated in UNICEF sponsored regional programs aimed at combating trafficking. Protection The government did not provide substantive evidence of protection of trafficking victims during the reporting period. The government restricted the ability of international and domestic NGOs to operate in Cuba. In partnership with one NGO and another government, Cuba continued to fund the operation of two centers treating sexually abused children, but the government did not provide information about who received treatment in these centers. The government also provided funding for women‚Äôs shelters where victims could access care, though the government did not provide information about who received treatment at the shelters. According to UNICEF, both the centers for children and the women‚Äôs shelters are used by trafficking victims, and the staff is trained specifically on how to identify and treat trafficking victims. The government did not report that police and other officials employed procedures to proactively identify trafficking victims, such as people in prostitution, and guide them to services, but a UNICEF representative indicated that the police receive specific training on identifying trafficking victims and information about how to refer them to available services. The government provided no evidence that it encouraged trafficking victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders. Prevention To date the government has made limited efforts in anti-trafficking prevention efforts. The government generally did not discuss publicly human trafficking issues. The government did not implement any known public awareness campaigns to prevent forced labor or forced prostitution. The government did not report the existence of an anti-trafficking task force, monitoring mechanism, or action plan. However, the National Action Plan for Children and Adolescents sets specific goals and provides implementation guidance on protecting the rights of children and preventing child labor, prostitution, and trafficking. During the reporting period, the official press produced several articles on Cuban citizens who reportedly were subjected to forced labor and forced prostitution in Mexico while awaiting passage to the United States. The government made no known efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex. The government denied it had a child sex tourism problem but it banned children under 16 from nightclubs, and according to Cuban government documents, the government provided training to hotel workers and others in the tourism industry on how to identify and report potential sex tourists.

Women identified as sex trafficking victims in Cyprus originated from Moldova, Ukraine, Bulgaria, the Philippines, Morocco, and Hungary. A large number of Romanian nationals were subjected to forced labor in the country in 2009. Sex trafficking occurs within venues used by Cyprus‚Äô commercial sex industry, including cabarets, bars, pubs, and massage parlors disguised as private apartments located throughout the country. Groups vulnerable to forced labor include domestic workers, asylum seekers, and migrants working in the farming and agricultural sectors. According to a 2008 EU Thematic Study on Child Trafficking for Cyprus, some children within migrant and Roma communities may be vulnerable to trafficking. The Government of Cyprus does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making some efforts to do so. The government drafted and passed a new National Action Plan and convicted an increased number of traffickers in 2009. However, during the reporting period, the government identified fewer sex trafficking victims, failed to consistently provide financial and social support services to trafficking victims, and did not effectively address trafficking-related complicity, which local observers report is hampering the government's anti-trafficking efforts.\\"Cyprus\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution Cyprus made some progress in its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts in 2009 by convicting an increased number of traffickers; however, overall sentences for trafficking-related offenses remained inadequate. Cyprus prohibits both sex and labor trafficking through Law 87 (I)/2007, which also contains protection measures for victims. Although the penalties prescribed for sex trafficking range up to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment, these penalties are not commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape, for which the maximum sentence is life in prison. During the reporting period, police investigated 57 persons in 17 suspected trafficking cases, compared with 70 persons in 29 suspected trafficking cases in 2008. Of the 17 trafficking cases, eight were sent to court, seven are still under investigation, and two were ‚Äúotherwise disposed of.‚Äù The government convicted ten sex trafficking offenders in 2009, compared with one in 2008, and courts handed down harsher penalties for some traffickers. Sentences ranged from a $4,400 fine to four years in prison. Local observers reported, however, that the Attorney General's Office downgraded trafficking cases and sometimes tried anti-trafficking cases in lower courts, which are less equipped to deal with serious offenses. In November 2009, police arrested and charged three suspects for subjecting 110 Romanians to forced labor, mostly in the construction sector; the ringleader reportedly used debt bondage and hired enforcers to control the workers, who were forced to live in converted shipping containers in an isolated industrial area near Nicosia. Cypriot police actively investigated the case with law enforcement counterparts in Romania; however, a district court released the main suspect after rejecting a fourth request by police for his detention. In 2009, police conducted 95 anti-trafficking raids and 20 undercover operations on establishments suspected of trafficking. Stakeholders reported that police inspected significantly fewer cabarets in 2009. The Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible for inspecting work premises associated with the new ‚Äúperforming artist‚Äù work permits; however, no DOL inspectors work after-hours, when ‚Äúperforming artists‚Äù are most subject to exploitation in cabarets. The government in 2009 added an additional member to its four-person police anti- trafficking unit; NGOs, however, report that the police still lack sufficient investigative resources to vigorously combat trafficking throughout the island. In 2008, the police presented a report to the House Human Rights Committee stating, according to local media, that traffickers ‚Äúhave influence on government officials, which makes the arrest and prosecution of traffickers more difficult.‚Äù A pending complicity investigation from 2008, involving four police officers who allegedly patronized a cabaret, has yet to be concluded. In 2007, the government transferred a police officer out of his unit for allegedly raping a trafficking victim; the court determined that the main witnesses in the case were unreliable, and the prosecution against the officer was dropped. Protection The Government of Cyprus made limited but inconsistent progress in ensuring that trafficking victims received necessary protective services over the last year. It continued to fund its own shelter dedicated for trafficking victims, allocating $280,000 for its operation in 2009. The government cared for a total of 47 trafficking victims in the shelter in 2009, compared with 59 victims assisted in 2008. In 2009, the government allocated $235,000 in funding for additional victim assistance, and the Department of Social Welfare Services reported assisting 66 female victims of commercial sexual exploitation and 163 male and female victims of labor exploitation. Although Cyprus‚Äô anti-trafficking law mandates referral of trafficking victims to the government's social welfare services and to the government shelter, it did not employ procedures for front-line responders to proactively identify potential victims during the year, sustaining a long- standing deficiency. NGOs report that the government's failure to recognize their critical role in protection negatively impacted on the government's ability to provide meaningful protection to trafficking victims. In 2009, the government identified a total of 114 new victims of trafficking, the majority of whom were from a forced labor ring involving Romanian nationals; it identified 21 sex trafficking victims in 2009, compared with 41 victims the government identified last year, the majority of whom were sex trafficking victims. The government reported it repatriated 50 of the Romanian labor trafficking victims; the other identified victims reportedly received 45 days of financial support from the government as well as job placement assistance and vocational training. During the year, the government allowed some victims to stay at the shelter longer than the four weeks prescribed by law. NGOs reported, however, that social services and psychological treatment at the shelter were inadequate, particularly for trafficking victims who do not speak the local languages. Although the government reported that all victims are entitled to long-term housing and welfare benefits, NGOs reported that several victims did not receive their full allowances on a consistent and timely basis. While the government provided some protections to a key prosecution witness from the Dominican Republic and allowed her to stay in the government shelter longer than four weeks, in comments to the media she reported overall inadequate treatment by the government. The government lacks a systematic procedure for the repatriation and safe return of trafficking victims. The government encouraged victims to participate in investigations of trafficking offenders and reported that all identified trafficking victims cooperated with law enforcement in 2009. However, cabaret owners and agents reportedly used attorneys to bribe potential witnesses, and pressured women to withdraw complaints or not follow through with testifying in court. In January 2010, the European Court of Human Rights found that Cyprus failed to adequately protect a trafficking victim from Russia who died in 2001 under suspicious circumstances. Prevention The government did not implement any comprehensive campaigns to specifically address demand within the context of Cyprus, or to educate clients about the realities of forced prostitution inherent to the island's sex industry, a long-standing deficiency. The government recently approved a 2010-2012 National Action Plan to combat human trafficking that calls for demand-focused public awareness campaigns and cooperation with NGOs to conduct outreach at universities, army camps, and other venues. The government also provided over $8,000 to a radio station for programming throughout the year that specifically addressed human trafficking in Cyprus. Although the government reported it adopted a new policy to screen applications for foreign ‚Äúperforming artists,‚Äù the work permit category that replaced the previous ‚Äúartiste visa,‚Äù some NGOs indicated that the revised policy had little actual impact on reducing trafficking in Cyprus‚Äô commercial sex industry. However, the government reported a nearly 40 percent decrease in the number of cabarets operating during the reporting period. During the reporting period, the government reported it issued 1,225 ‚Äúperforming artist‚Äù work permits and 20 ‚Äúcreative artist‚Äù permits; these numbers include renewals and changes of employer. The government reported that, as of February 2010, there were 331 performing artists in Cyprus. One NGO reported a sharp increase in the issuance of ‚Äúbarmaid‚Äù work permits in 2009; the government reported it issued 467 such permits in 2009, up from 422 issued during the previous reporting period. Another NGO questioned the government's official statistics on trafficking, speculating that a number of trafficking victims were intentionally left out of the statistics to indicate a smaller problem.

However, the Ottoman Empire's complex web of tax exemptions also touched on tekalif; taxpayers could be exempted for public service (for instance, by running a hostel for pilgrims), and sometimes a district's could be exempted due to exceptional hardship (for instance, if the district had already paid heavily towards other taxes, or been ravaged by warfare). Some Janissaries were exempted from tekalif-i orfiye although Janissary status could be effectively hereditary rather than a real military role. A muafname might exempt a community from some or all tekalif-i orfiye.

The origins of rav ak√ßesi are unclear; it has been suggested that it was one of two taxes imposed specifically on Jews, and that it may have developed in parallel with the authority of a senior rabbi in Istanbul, who was at nominally a representative and judge for Jewish communities in the Ottoman empire, although their authority may not have extended far beyond Istanbul. It has been suggested that Mehmet II imposed the tax in return for separate representation of Jews after 1455, as part of a broader effort to rebuild and revive Istanbul; this may also have served to undermine the Greek patriarchy. Under the Ottoman empire there was, at time, friction between \\"Greeks\\" and \\"Jews\\"; the authorities may at times have favoured one over the other.Ankori, Zvi (1977).

Non-Muslims were usually taxed at a higher rate, overall, in the Ottoman empire, thanks to taxes such as rav ak√ßesi and ispence. Jews in particular may have been singled out to pay higher rates of ispence. The Porte was well aware of this - and even aware that this would tempt non-Muslims to convert; Bayezit II ruled that courts should treat non-Muslims more leniently (including such measures as lower fines), \\"so that the poll-tax payers shall not vanish\\".

Bettendorf (October 10, 1864 ‚Äì May, 1933) was a businessman with his brother William P. Bettendorf in Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa. The city of Bettendorf is named after the two brothers. Biography =Early life & Career= Joseph Bettendorf was born in Leavenworth, Kansas, the third child and second son of Michael Bettendorf and Catherine (Reck) Bettendorf. His father was born Michael Betteldorf in Nohn in the German Eifel region and changed his surname upon arrival in the United States. Joseph was nine years old when the family settled in Peru, Illinois, where he received most of his education. His first job was as a machinist and he worked his way up to foreman in the assembly department. J.W. Bettendorf moved to Davenport, Iowa in 1886 to join his brother William where they organized Bettendorf Metal Wheel Company. He worked as a machinist before becoming a supervisor in the plant. In 1890 he moved to Springfield, Ohio where he managed a branch of the business. He returned to Davenport three years later where the brothers began manufacturing steel gear wagons. =The Bettendorf Company= The Bettendorf Co. headquarters In January 1895 the brothers incorporated their new venture under the name of the Bettendorf Axel Company. W. P. Bettendorf was the company's first president and J.W. Bettendorf initially served as secretary and manager of the company. Two fires in 1902, one on January 28 and the other in May, destroyed the plant. The residents of the town of Gilbert, which was about three miles east of Davenport at the time, raised $15,000 to buy the old Gilbert farm between the Mississippi River and the Davenport, Rock Island and North Western Railway tracks. The brothers decided to establish a new plant in Gilbert. A year later the citizens of the town elected to change its name to Bettendorf. In 1906 J.W. became treasurer of the company. The factory was built on a plot of land. The company originally was a manufacturer of agricultural implements. Its rapid growth was spurred by William Bettendorf's design of a one-piece railroad truck frame that eliminated bolts, which would work loose as the train was moving and cause delays or derailments. The new frame was cast from a single piece of steel and revolutionized the railroad industry. By 1909 the plant had grown to three times its original size. It contained two regenerative open-hearth basic steel furnaces, with a capacity of 25 tons per heat. They were able to output about one hundred tons of finished steel castings daily that were used in the construction of the railroad boxcars. A complete railroad car was built from raw materials in the east end of the plant to the finished product on the west end. The company expanded in the early 20th century and its divisions made 29 different machines or tools.Ryan, 143 They acquired the Dooler Oil Company, which was later renamed the Bettendorf Oil Burner, Buddy L toys, Slice-Master bread and cake slicers and Chippewa Pumps, which made water pumps. They also had divisions that produced hand dollys to move rail cars, ice crushers, table-top cigar lighters, and a machine to compress and bundle wastepaper. The company also built the Meteor automobile between 1907 and 1912. Corporate holding companies named Micro and Westco were established to hold these acquisitions. They were later merged and named Micro-Westco. Between 1903 and 1910 the workforce grew from 300 to 800 employees. Bettendorf House, now Rivermont Collegiate. William Bettendorf died on June 3, 1910 and J.W. took over the leadership of the company. While William invented many of the products that the company manufactured, J.W. was known for his business sense that allowed the company to expand and grow financially. Workers worked six ten-hour days a week with an hour off for lunch. Piece workers and day laborers were paid $40 to $50 a week. While the company grew it was also known to have a \\"family atmosphere\\" about it. Parties, picnics and sporting competitions were held on a regular basis. A magazine called the Car Journal was published for employees and their families monthly. Employees who worked for the company ten years or more were enrolled in the Loyalty Club. As World War I took hold the company experienced labor shortages. Armenian and Greek immigrants had provided most of the labor force. Company recruiters were sent to Juarez, Mexico to find workers. A village was constructed to house the 150 Mexican workers that came to Bettendorf and was called \\"Holy City.\\" Its name was derived from the multiple number of workers whose name was recorded as \\"Jesus,\\" whether that was his name or not. Many also gave their name as \\"George Washington\\" and the most common birth date was July 4. The company had built a series of one-room cottages to house the laborers. There were also two-story frame apartment buildings for the unmarried workers and some of the larger box cars were also used for housing. Holy City was demolished in the 1940s and is now the sight of storage tanks owned by oil companies. Grave in Oakdale Cemetery By 1920 the Bettendorf plant was the largest railroad car manufacturing plant west of the Mississippi River and employed 3,000 people. The company was affected by the Great Depression. The plant was closed in 1932, the year before J.W. Bettendorf died. At the start of World War II the plant was used by the United States Navy to produce protective devices for ships. The truck plant was bought by the United States Army in 1942 to produce tanks. In 1946 the plant was sold to J.I. Case. Today it is the site of the Isle of Capri Casino. =Personal life= J.W. Bettendorf married Elizabeth Ohl in 1888. She was the daughter of George and Sibilla Ohl. They raised two sons, Edwin J. and William E. He built an estate on situated on a bluff overlooking the city of Bettendorf and the river valley below. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. For whatever reason, J.W. Bettendorf's house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Joseph F. Bettendorf House. The property is now the campus of a private school, Rivermont Collegiate. Bettendorf died in May 1933Ryan, 145 and was buried in Oakdale Cemetery in Davenport.

Mechanism N√ºz√ºl was designed as a form of requisitioning from farms, to feed Ottoman armed forces; large quantities of food were needed to support Ottoman armies in the field. Flour was a major constituent in the 16th-17th century. Producers were expected to deliver n√ºz√ºl to the required destination, and were not paid for this. N√ºz√ºl was supervised by the local kadis, an official who acted as both a judge and a tax-collector; Ottoman central government determined the kadi's jurisdiction, and set the levels of taxes to be collected  they were even required to arrange supplies of ship biscuit, in parallel with n√ºz√ºl provision. A waqf might be founded to help a specific community pay their n√ºz√ºl and avariz obligations. Frontier areas, such as Bosnia, might be exempted from these tax obligations (much as some pastoral groups in the marcher-land were given tax exemptions on the understanding that they would raid enemy territory). History N√ºz√ºl collection, as an irregular tax, began at least as early as the start of the 16th century. Initially, N√ºz√ºl was seen as an alternative to avariz, which was a cash tax; in times of war, villages might be required to supply food to army supply points, or they might be required to supply cash; but never both. Over time, this relationship changed, and both might be demanded. As with other Ottoman taxes, what was originally a requirement for payment \\"in kind\\" became a cash tax over time. A related concept was sursat, which was an obligation for food producers to sell food at prices dictated by central government. Detailed Ottoman tax registers survive which show the levels and details of taxation in different provinces. Although the tax burden was very variable, n√ºz√ºl and avariz were very important taxes in the 17th century - for instance, they represented 58% of all tax revenue in Manastir in 1621-1622 - but by the 18th century their importance had declined, and more money was collected through other taxes.

The treasury was well aware of the difference in tax takes, and the incentive to convert; the legal reforms of Bayezid II halved some criminal penalties on non-Muslim taxpayers \\"so that the taxpayers shall not vanish\\"; this rule was reconfirmed a century later, in 1587. In other cases, local taxes were imposed on non-Muslims specifically to encourage conversion. ƒ∞spen√ße had existed in the Balkans before the Ottoman conquest; the Ottoman Empire typically adapted local taxes and institutions in each conquered area, leading to a patchwork of different taxes and rates. The concept of ƒ∞spen√ße, theoretically a payment in lieu of corvee labour, was derived from the Byzantine \\"zeugaratikion\\", a land tax based on the zeugarion - the area of farmland which could be ploughed by a pair of oxen. The zeugarion itself was taken up as the Ottoman \\"√ßift\\", a word meaning \\"pair\\". Variation Despite taxes being set centrally, by the Porte, there was some local variance; around 1718. the kadƒ± of Janjevo complained to Istanbul that the local lord set ispen√ße at 80 ak√ßes per year rather than official rate of 32. As with other Ottoman taxes, there were various exemptions and loopholes; royal hunters, who provided birds-of-prey to the court, had an exemption from ispen√ße (and other taxes); they could pass on their job, and the tax exemption, to their sons. There were also some exemptions for those unable to work their land through disability, although it was expected that the elderly would have children able to work and therefore to pay ispen√ße. The tax was paid by adult male heads of households; in the Morea it increased to 25 akces (from 20) between 1480 and 1512, and stayed at a similar level after that, (for most), confirmed by the tahrir of 1583; but widows may have paid a reduced rate, and Jews may have paid 125 akces.

Some Figures for the Urban and Rural Populations of Damascus Province in the Late Seventeenth Century. Osmanlƒ± Ara≈ütƒ±rmalarƒ±, 35(35). pp.215-216 History In early Ottoman history, the state depended on the timar system of feudal dues; but over time - especially due to the need to hire professional soldiers rather than peasants serving a feudal military obligation - more emphasis was placed on cash taxes, and avarƒ±z took over from the timar system. Avarƒ±z began in the late fifteenth century. Initially, n√ºz√ºl was seen as an alternative to avarƒ±z; nuzul was (in principle) a payment of food, in kind. In times of war, villages might be required to supply food to army supply points, or they might be required to supply cash; but never both. Over time, this relationship changed, and both might be demanded (whilst n√ºz√ºl also became a cash tax). Detailed Ottoman tax registers survive which show the levels and details of taxation in different provinces. Although the tax burden was very variable, n√ºz√ºl and avarƒ±z were very important taxes in the 17th century - for instance, they represented 58% of all tax revenue in Manastir in 1621-1622 - but by the 18th century their importance had declined, and more money was collected through other taxes. Technically the registers were counting property not people, with an urban register for Damascus documenting each dwelling in the city and even the condition of the property. It however also identified the owners and they were the ones liable to be taxed. An avarƒ±zhane was a household defined for tax purposes. Initially, this was equivalent to one gercekhane (i.e. a real household), but over time, taxpayers were aggregated into larger groups; by the seventeenth century, an avarƒ±zhane might include several households, or gercekhanes. Avarƒ±z might be collected through an Iltizam, or tax farm. Avarƒ±z as a category of taxes The name \\"Avarƒ±z\\" was also used as a blanket term for cash taxes levied by central government, or avarƒ±z-i divaniye. The term later came to be used for one specific tax. Difficulties and exemptions Occasionally the tax burden could be heavy, provoking rebellion. Some waqfs were founded to help communities pay their n√ºz√ºl and avarƒ±z obligations each year. The Ottoman Empire had a complex system of tax exemptions, and avarƒ±z was no exception. Various groups were exempted from avarƒ±z on the basis of lineage, public service by favoured professions, and sometimes a district's an exceptional inability to pay (for instance, if the district had already paid heavily towards other taxes, or been ravaged by warfare). The most common exemption was for villages which had been assigned guard duties.

After a muafname was issued to a town, the urban population would be exempted from some of the taxes on raya, such as resm-i √ßift. Taxation in the Ottoman Empire was complex, including various routine and extraordinary taxes, and different rates for social groups; a muafname might apply to one or more of these taxes. The Muafiyet system was a deliberate policy of the Sublime Porte, working to encourage the growth of urban populations from the 15th century onwards, although forgoing some tax revenue. Tax exemption was prized by locals; so, the granting of a muafname was subject to \\"pull\\" as well as \\"push\\". Muafname might be requested by the local bey or kadƒ±. Enforcement of the complex patchwork of taxes and exemptions could vary; in one case, taxes were collected from villages despite a muafname, and the local kadƒ± wrote that subsequent legitimate taxes were held back to compensate for the wrongful taxation. * Sarajevo, in Bosnia Eyalet, was granted muafname by Mehmed II in the 1460s; there was subsequent \\"creep\\" in the remit due to pressure from groups of local people. * In 1758, a new muafname exempted all the Muslims of Sarajevo from taxes. * The populace of Banja Luka were exempted from all customary and extraordinary taxes \\"as long as they are ready to repulse with weapons the attacks of infidels against the Sultan's lands and fortresses\\". * After its conquest, both Muslims and non-Muslims of Selanik were granted a muafname exempting them from avariz-i divaniyye and tekalif-i √∂rfiye.

Unlike a timar holder, an emin was a salaried official. Emins could operate outside the normal Ottoman bureaucracy; they were not necessarily Muslim. Emins as customs officers The emin was usually a customs officer - that is to say, a g√ºmr√ºk emini ; they were responsible for managing revenue from certain taxes, and collected duties on goods exported by foreigners. Although formally a tax official, the role of the emin (as with the role of other officials, such as the Kadi) could vary in practice; they might also be involved in consular, mediation, or even notarial work; and as a representative of the Ottoman state, could be authorised to apprehend Ottoman subjects who had committed crimes on foreign territory. As such, an emin resident in a foreign port that traded with the Ottoman empire could be valuable to both parties. An emin serving in a port could even act as a harbour-master or could prevent the export of restricted goods; in at least one case, Istanbul had to specifically instruct an emin to permit the export of a 27000 kg shipment of lead to be used by allies, which the emin had stopped in the port. Emins as government agents An emin could also exercise government control over guilds - although if a guild's own rules were recognised by the sultan, then the rules could be enforced as law by a kadi. The emin could also take the place of a tax-farmer, collecting a defined package of taxes, and might report back to central authority identifying new ways to increase tax take. The sultan might grant extensive powers to the emin to ensure that taxes were collected. The emin might also be appointed to project-manage major construction work, and would submit a full report on each project - with financial details. Emins also supervised coin minting, to prevent the theft of silver, or other fraud by mint employees. Emins might even be appointed as auditors, to investigate irregularities in tax collection performed by other officials; the emins could make recommendations on how to remedy the problem.

Initially, the tax was known as resm-i aƒünam; the name changed around 1550. Rate The tax varied; some records show a charge of one ak√ße per head of livestock, whilst other records show a charge of one ak√ße for every two or three sheep. In one case, the first hundred animals in a flock were tax-exempt. This tax could be a source of considerable revenue, even in areas where wheat and barley farming were dominant. The adet-i aƒünam could be subject to tax farming; magnates would pay a hefty downpayment to the treasury in return for the right to collect sheep-taxes from villages. The Ottoman government used various means to encourage sheep- rearing, because it was a source of substantial revenue; it could also make a profit for vakufs, and other concessions might be granted to sheep-farmers. In 1540, a survey carried out around the Diyarbakir and Maras areas found 8013 nomadic households with a combined flock of two million sheep ‚Äì and a tax liability of one million ak√ßes. Careful measures were taken to ensure appropriate taxation on butchers, too, who might buy sheep for slaughter in April (just before the tax was due) which would have reduced the sheep-farmers liability. Adet-i aƒünam was one of the taxes that Y√ºr√ºk irregular troops were expected to pay, despite being exempted from other taxes when recruited. Background The tax was paid to the Ottoman treasury. Because the tax went direct to the treasury, instead of local timar-holders, it is mentioned less often in tahrirs. Nonetheless, some tax records do show the annual revenue from adet-i aƒünam in each district, and therefore show the number of sheep. For instance, in 1490, there were a total of 24509 sheep on Limnos ‚Äì an average of 8.4 sheep per inhabitant. Sometimes, the annual adet-i aƒünam charge would be rolled up with other taxes into a single composite annual tax including cizye and ispence - plus the tax-collector's fee. There was a further tax on sheep, the ondalƒ±k, which was only levied in the province of Rumelia. Unlike various other Ottoman taxes, adet-i aƒünam continued after the Tanzimat reforms ‚Äì alongside cizye, and a new income tax.

Life Goldberg was born on 7 May 1910 in St Petersburg, Russia. Following the revolution he emigrated with his parents in 1918 and settled in Berlin, where he attended a French school, and later studied Chinese and Japanese at the Berlin School of Oriental Studies. In the early 1930s when an architecture student he made his first visit to Moscow, acting as interpreter on the construction of the British embassy. He was a \\"brilliant linguist and a lifelong Anglophile\\", and with the advent of the Nazi government in Germany he and his wife emigrated to Britain, where at the outbreak of World War II in 1939 he joined the BBC Monitoring Service, working in German, Russian and Spanish. From its inception on 26 March 1946 he was a member of the Russian Service of the BBC and rose to become its head. In this position in the 1950s he was the focus of a dispute between the Foreign Office and the BBC, the former accusing him of appeasement of the Soviet regime, and in the late 1960s was attacked from Moscow over Czechoslovakia. However, for 35 years he delivered his Sunday evening interpretation of British and world current affairs, \\"Notes by our Observer\\", to his Russian audience, along with numerous additional topical commentaries. He was made MBE for his services, and was retained by the BBC beyond the normal retirement age. He had the reputation of being a helpful colleague, \\"always willing to give others the benefit of his great experience, elephantine memory and wide international contacts\\". He died in his post in 1982 at the age of 71, having recently celebrated his golden wedding; his funeral was at Golders Green. Controversy Goldberg was broadcasting to the Soviet Union at a time when the tone and purpose of the broadcasts were disputed within the BBC. John Tusa, former head of the BBC World Service, wrote of Goldberg's position: \\"great men such as the Russian Service commentator Anatol Goldberg... insisted that it was insulting to tell the Soviet audience how lousy life was; they knew that better than you did. What they wanted was facts. The BBC gave them facts and analysis; opinions they could provide themselves.\\" In fact the BBC's position seems to have been more complex. Ian Jacob, the BBC's Director of Overseas Services, wrote in 1949, \\"It is evident that any country deciding to embark on a service of broadcasts to foreign audiences does so because it wants to influence those audiences in its favour. All such broadcasting is therefore propaganda.\\" The government department with responsibility for producing the propaganda was the Information Research Department, or IRD, a secret unit within the Foreign Office. A 1957 internal memorandum by the BBC's Foreign Office Liaison Officer says \\"much of the material and a great deal of the background for the BBC's broadcasts to the Soviet Union, the satellites and China reaches the BBC from this department. The liaison in this respect is both close and constant.\\" The issue of propaganda \\"led to bitter editorial disputes within the BBC\\", and with the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 the debate intensified. Goldberg, among others, \\"argued that the dictator's death might provide a fresh opportunity for dialogue with the Soviet audience and for the encouragement of gradual political liberalisation\\", while a conservative faction was sceptical of the new leadership and judged that change in the Soviet Union would come about only through pressure. Goldberg \\"considered his contacts with the IRD personal, and he maintained very good relations with various IRD representatives.\\" However in the mid-1950s \\"the IRD had sixty staff, permanent and contract, in the Soviet section\\" and elements unfriendly to his position attempted to discredit Goldberg and establish a harder BBC line: > It was against this background that the IRD drew up a detailed charge-sheet > against the BBC's Russian Service. It accused Goldberg of being \\"ambivalent\\" > towards the Soviet regime and of having an attitude \\"more in accord with a > dissident form of doctrinaire Marxism than with British feelings\\". The > insinuation of disloyalty was obvious enough. Indeed, in one document, the > IRD urged either \\"the replacement of Mr Goldberg... by someone who accepts > our conception of the role of broadcasting to Russia\\" or else the > replacement of Goldberg's immediate superior. The IRD said its complaint was \\"fundamentally about the general atmosphere and emphasis\\" of BBC Russian broadcasts and that \\"the definition of the role of the BBC's broadcasts to Russia is primarily a matter for the Foreign Office\\". The BBC was broadcasting material that was \\"damaging to the Free World\\", and the Russian Service failed to reflect \\"responsible British opinion\\" and followed a general line \\"more like that of the New Statesman and Nation\\". The BBC declined to dismiss Goldberg, but in 1957 The Spectator, seemingly primed by the IRD, attacked the Russian Service \\"on grounds very similar to those put forward in 1953\\", accusing the service of \\"moral compromise and appeasement\\", and specifically charging Goldberg. In 1958 Goldberg was replaced as head of the Russian Service, but he was retained as its main commentator. Following the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Goldberg's commentaries stung the Soviet Union into accusing him of subversion and espionage. Impact of broadcasts From April 1949 the Soviet authorities expended \\"vast amounts of money and technical expertise\\" on jamming foreign broadcasts, and \\"a significant part of the USSR's entire radio broadcasting system was devoted to blocking transmissions from abroad.\\" The BBC's Russian Service was blocked \\"selectively and varyingly\\", and jamming was not fully effective, as a 2008 communication to the New Statesman makes clear: > I had [the] privilege to listen [to the] BBC observer Anatolii Maksimovich > Goldberg from 1948, when I was 13 years old, to 1979 when I left the Soviet > Union forever.

And in this sense [he] was > one of the main agents who prepared the ground for our perestroika.\\" > > Professor Boris Grushin, a one-time adviser to Boris Yeltsin, said that > during the cold war Goldberg was \\"the only human voice that reached our > country from abroad. He was extraordinarily popular. He was the Number One.\\" In 1979 the Soviet Union issued a book warning of the dangers of the BBC, and drew attention to Goldberg's broadcasts: > one can hear in his commentaries a respectful tone towards his audience, a > familiarity with the true facts of real life, the outward appearance of > logic in his reasoning. One can hear of his genuine concern over the threat > of military conflicts and the atmosphere of violence in the world, of the > 'satisfaction' which he feels at the peace initiatives of various states > including the USSR. Goldberg's talks are characterised by a soft, > conversational tone, skilful use of intonation and emphasis, reasonableness, > solidity and even wit. The Russian dissident and exile Alexander Solzhenitsyn insisted the BBC should not endow the Kremlin with a sense of legitimacy, and on a visit to the BBC in 1976 refused to meet Goldberg. Biography of Ilya Ehrenburg At the time of his death, Goldberg was working on, and had substantially completed, a study of Ilya Ehrenburg, subtitled Revolutionary, novelist, poet, war correspondent, propagandist: the extraordinary epic of a Russian survivor. It was brought to press by his former BBC colleague Erik de Mauny. The New York Times wrote, \\"Ilya Ehrenburg, born into a well-to-do Jewish family in Kiev in 1891, was an outsized romantic who fell in love with Russia, revolution and Europe, embracing all three simultaneously, unable to deny any of them even when they betrayed his vision of their ideals.... No one was better fitted to write his biography than Anatol Goldberg, a product of the same cultivated Russian- Jewish professional class that molded Ehrenburg's temperament.\\" In paying tribute to Goldberg's gifts as a biographer, de Mauny says the study \\"sometimes seems too ready to give its subject the benefit of the doubt.\\"  References  External links *BBC article BBC radio presenters BBC World Service Members of the Order of the British Empire Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom Russian Jews 1910 births 1982 deaths People from Saint Petersburg Imperial Russian emigrants to the United Kingdom Imperial Russian emigrants to Germany ","title":"Anatol Goldberg"},{"id":"31515846","text":"Working with the Hands by Booker T.

It has an altitude of 938 metres and spans the border of N√≥gr√°d County and Pest County. This area was geologically active in the Miocene era, 18 to 19 million years ago. In the Quaternary, when volcanic activity commenced, the immediate environment of Cs√≥v√°nyos emerged. These movements created water features, high above the forests. The forest on the mountain is dense with blue beech and Austrian oak. Geography The mountain lies within the Ipoly River Basin, which is a transboundary river between Slovakia and Hungary with the middle and lower basin lying in Hungarian territory. The Hungarian territory of the basin covers an area of formed by the hills of Nograd, Cserhat and Borzsony; Borzsony includes the Cs√≥v√°nyos The Cs√≥v√°nyos mountain peak as part of the B√∂rzs√∂ny Mountain ranges, lie in the Danube-Ipoly National Park in northern Hungary; the park is one of ten Hungarian national parks set up to \\"protect forested hills as well as riparian and lowland habitats.\\" Flora Lookout tower The nearby alder forest of Dr√©gelypal√°nk and the red pine forest of Di√≥sjen≈ë have been described as \\"almost mystic\\".

Early life Jackson was born in Lancaster, Lancashire in 1964 to parents Estelle and Michael Jackson. He was brought up by his mother in Morecambe, Lancashire from an early age. A fanatical Queen fan Jackson dreamed of being a rock singer like his idol Freddie Mercury. Entering the Merchant Navy straight from school he spent five years sailing all over the world while singing with the band Rough Edge between assignments.  Satan/Pariah  Eventually he decided to answer an advertisement, learned the required songs and travelled to London for his audition with the band Satan. After a successful interview at Clink Studios, Tower Bridge, London he moved there to join Satan. The first recordings with Satan later became the EP \\"Into the Future\\" which was well received by the press, leading to a deal with Steamhammer Records, Germany. In between recordings the band toured Europe, mainly the Netherlands, which culminated in their appearance at the first Dynamo Open Air Festival in 1986. He has fond memories of this festival, especially meeting Angel Witch and Laaz Rocket. Satan were later to tour with Angelwitch in 1987. The first full album, \\"Suspended Sentence\\" was released in 1987 and toured Europe with Running Wild to promote it. At this point, Satan realised they were creating the wrong impression with their band name. During their tour with Running Wild religious groups would gather outside venues burning tour T-shirts. After much deliberation the band decided to change their name to Pariah. Jackson's next album with Pariah was the very heavy \\"The Kindred\\". It was released in 1987 but Jackson was never a big fan of the songs and always felt they could have produced something better. At this point touring dates dried up and he was feeling a little despondent with the way things were going. Having become friends with the band Sabbat and wanting to keep busy Jackson roadied for Sabbat during their first UK tour along with bandmates Graeme English and Steve Ramsey (who was the tour manager). It was a fun tour and the band realised it was time to write a much more versatile album so began working on what he later came to realise was the best piece of work the band ever produced. \\"Blaze of Obscurity\\" was (like \\"The Kindred\\") recorded in Germany and released in 1989 to a KKKKK review in Kerrang magazine and fantastic reviews across publications throughout Europe. Despite the critical acclaim Jackson left the band towards the end of 1989. =Reason for leaving= Many fans were surprised that Jackson left the band at such a time. \\"After the release of \\"Blaze of Obscurity\\" I felt the band had produced a truly great album. We toured Germany to promote the album and recorded a live concert that was to be released plus a video for Blaze. At this time we were introduced to Japanese label Metal Mania who confirmed they would not only be releasing \\"Blaze of Obscurity\\" but also the band's back catalogue of music in Japan. An American publishing deal was also mentioned and the band were extremely excited about their future. Unfortunately, as time went by it was obvious that, due to the lack of a strong management team, these new avenues for the band were just fading away. A new album was mentioned but I felt it was time to go home to Morecambe to clear my head and make a decision as to what to do next. I decided against returning to the band as the disappointment in the events surrounding Blaze were too much and I felt the record company we were with was just not strong enough. If the record company couldn't break Blaze into the marketplace then what chance would another album make under the same company banner? I have been asked over the years why I left and that's basically it. We made great records yet were still knocking at closed doors. Mike Jackson\\" =Post Pariah= Jackson always loved being part of a band and joined local groups \\"The All Stars\\" and \\"The Minstrels of Power\\" for a while. Needing to make a living Jackson moved into the cabaret circuit and has spent the last twenty plus years entertaining people throughout Lancashire and the UK as part of a Blues Brothers tribute, DJ, karaoke host and solo act. He is now using his extensive knowledge of the entertainment business to plan events through his company Wibble Promotions and is always interested in new projects for him to contribute to. Personal life Jackson met his wife Sharon in 1990, they married in 1994 and have two children.

Biography Reichard was the daughter of a cup- bearer of the Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. She married the chemist and physicist Johann Gottfried Reichard in 1807 and their first child was born in 1807. The family moved to Berlin in 1810. That same year Johann Gottfried Reichard made his first flight in a self-constructed gas balloon from Berlin, making him the second person to fly in a gas balloon in Germany. On 16 April 1811 Wilhelmine Reichard made her first solo flight, starting in Berlin. She reached a height of over and landed safely in Genshagen, from her starting point. This was not the first solo flight by a woman in Germany; the Frenchwoman Sophie Blanchard had previously made a flight in September 1810, starting from Frankfurt. Reichard's third flight in 1811 reached a height of approximately . Due to the altitude she lost consciousness and her balloon crash-landed in a forest; badly injured, she was rescued by local farmers. After some difficulties during the Napoleonic Wars, her husband wanted to purchase a chemical factory in D√∂hlen. To raise the money, Wilhemine Reichard conducted several more flights. Her first flight after the accident in 1811 took place in October 1816. A later flight took place during the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in Aachen in 1818. Flights in Prague and Vienna also made her known in Austria-Hungary. Her last flight was in October 1820, starting in Munich at the Oktoberfest, which was held on the 10th anniversary of the first Oktoberfest. In 1821, the chemical factory started operations. Wilhelmine's husband conducted balloon flights until 1835. He died in 1844, and Wilhelmine managed the chemical factory until her own death in 1848.

Alexander was possibly made co-emperor by his father before the Ottoman conquest of the Tarnovo Tsardom in 1395. After the subjugation of Ivan Shishman's realm and his execution, Alexander converted to Islam to avoid his father's fate. He was made governor of Samsun, where he remained until 1402. From 1413 to 1418, when he was killed in a battle against a local rebel, Alexander was in charge of Smyrna (ƒ∞zmir). Biography There is no information about Alexander's early life in the contemporary sources. Indeed, the only hint as to his existence in a Bulgarian source is an anonymous reference in Ephraim's Prayer Canon to the Tsar, where he is only mentioned as ‚Äúthe son of the tsar‚Äù. It is uncertain whether Alexander was born to Ivan Shishman's first wife, Kira Maria, or to his second wife, a daughter of Prince Lazar of Serbia (r. 1371‚Äì1389).–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, pp. 229, 241 Due to Alexander's first-born status, Bulgarian historian Petar Nikov conjectures that at some point before 1395, Alexander was made co-ruler by his father Ivan Shishman. This would have been in line with a custom that dates to the reign of Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì1371), Ivan Shishman's own father.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, p. 241–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, p. 10 Alexander had a younger brother, Fruzhin, who, in contrast to Alexander, was a staunch opponent of the Ottomans and a Hungarian subject.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, pp. 242‚Äì244–ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤, p. 100 In addition to Fruzhin, Alexander had other brothers and sisters, of whom practically nothing is known.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, pp. 245‚Äì246 The Fall of Tarnovo in 1393 and the subsequent subjugation of the entire Tarnovo Tsardom in 1395 resulted in the execution of Ivan Shishman by Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1389‚Äì1402). Though his successor Alexander was spared by the Ottomans, he was forced into accepting Islam and was exiled to Asia Minor so as to keep him far from his father's previous domains. Alexander, subsequently referred to as Iskender in Ottoman sources, was installed as governor of Samsun and the neighbouring territories (‚Äúthe land of Canik‚Äù). These lands lay along the southern Black Sea coast, between Sinope and Trebizond, and had been recently conquered by Bayezid. Alexander possibly remained governor of Samsun until 1402, when this region was conquered by the Timurids in the wake of the Battle of Ankara on 20 July of that year. After the Timurid victory, the Samsun region came under the rule of the Seljuk prince ƒ∞sfendiyar.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, p. 242 Alexander's subsequent fate is unknown until the end of the Ottoman Interregnum in 1413, when Mehmed I (r. 1413‚Äì1421) had established himself as ruler of the Ottoman Empire and had retaken the region of Smyrna on the eastern Aegean coast. Until then, Smyrna had been ruled by C√ºneyt, the bey of Aydin, who was exiled as governor of the previously Bulgarian city of Nikopol on the Danube. Alexander was installed as the ruler of Smyrna in C√ºneyt's place. He remained in charge of the city until 1418, when he attempted to suppress a rebellion to the south of Smyrna headed by Sheikh Bedrettin's follower B√∂rkl√ºce Mustafa. However, Alexander's forces proved insufficient for the purpose. His army was ambushed in a mountain gorge and suffered a great defeat, during which Alexander was killed.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, pp. 10‚Äì11 According to the theory of Bulgarian historian Plamen Pavlov, during his time as governor of Smyrna, Alexander may have been in active contact with his possible half-brother, the future Patriarch Joseph II of Constantinople. From 1393 to 1416, Joseph was the metropolitan bishop of Ephesus, another city on the eastern Aegean coast located not far from Smyrna. Pavlov conjectures that Joseph's selection as patriarch may have been influenced by his ties to Mehmed I via Alexander. In Pavlov's opinion, it is also possible that titular Bulgarian tsar Constantine II's support for Mehmed was in some way related to his relative Alexander's position as an Ottoman governor.–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤, pp. 235‚Äì236 References Sources  14th-century births 1418 deaths 14th-century Bulgarian people 15th-century Bulgarian people Bulgarian people of Jewish descent Bulgarian princes Bulgarian royalty Converts to Islam from Eastern Orthodoxy Former Bulgarian Orthodox Christians Sratsimir dynasty Ottoman ƒ∞zmir/Smyrna People of the Ottoman Empire of Bulgarian descent Muslims of Jewish descent ","title":"Alexander (son of Ivan Shishman)"},{"id":"31516002","text":"The 2008 Mexican Figure Skating Championships took place between 12 and 17 November 2007 in Guadalajara.

It is commonly found in areas where moisture is plentiful, such as moist soils in fields, the banks of streams and rivers or inundated beneath the surface of the rivers. It grows to a maximum height of about 5 millimetres and the plants are monoecious; the sex organs are visible on the dorsal surface. The thallus is nearly flat on the upper surface. It is of dark green and somewhat lustrous color, devoid of intercellular spaces. Its capsule is commonly to in length. The base is surrounded by a cylindrical sheath that often flares at the mouth. Spores are yellow with a granular-papillose surface. The elaters are yellowish, often branches, and varying in size and form. The slender green capsules, when produced in large numbers, resemble grass tufts. Mature spores are necessary for species determination. The cytology of P. laevis has been subject to considerable study. In 1909, Lotsy reported that the plant contained one chloroplast in each cell of the gametophyte and two in each cell of the sporophyte. The sporophyte is likened to an elongated spindle. Research conducted by Lorbeer in 1924 revealed that two plastids are present in a cell when it is undergoing cell division, of which according to McAllister may vary in size. The centrosomes of the species, much like Marchantia polymorpha, are composed of two centrioles apposed end-to end, which are connected by a continuation of their cartwheel structures.

He is known for his research on basic developmental processes at work within the mother-infant relationship. Using animal models, he found unexpected neurobiological and behavioral regulatory processes within the observable interactions of the infant rat and its mother. Through an experimental analysis of these sensorimotor, thermal and nutrient-based processes, he has contributed to our understanding of the impact of early maternal separation, the origins of the attachment system, and the shaping of later development by variations in how mothers and infants interact.Pipp S. and Harmon RJ (1987) ‚ÄúAttachment As Regulation: A Commentary‚Äù ‚ÄúChild Development‚Äù 58: 648‚Äì652Gallagher, W (1992) \\"Works in Progress‚Äù \\"The Sciences\\", N.Y.

Myron Hofer: an appreciation‚Äù \\"Developmental Psychobiology\\" 47: (3) 200‚Äì208  Early life  Born in New York City, Hofer‚Äôs family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1939 when his father, Philip Hofer, became curator of the Department of Printing and Graphic Arts at Harvard's newly built Houghton Library. Hofer went to school and college in the Boston area and married in 1954. His wife, Lynne, co-founded Young Filmmakers Foundation and later became a psychoanalyst. The Hofers have three children and eight grandchildren.  Career path  Hofer graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School (MD 1958), did his residency training in Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and in Psychiatry at New York State Psychiatric Institute, followed by post-doctoral research at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the American Museum of Natural History, before joining the department of psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1966, where he began his animal model research. In 1984, Hofer moved with his research group to the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and in 2000 was appointed Director of the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology.  Research and related activities  Following his early clinical research as member of the NIMH group studying threatened loss and bereavement in the parents of children with leukemia,Bowlby, J. (1980) ‚ÄúAttachment and Loss,Vol.3, Loss, Sadness and Depression‚Äù Basic Books-Harper Collins, Ch. 7, 112‚Äì125, Ch.9, 143‚Äì156 Hofer turned to animal model research to study the biological basis for the impact of separation and loss in a typical laboratory mammal. He described widespread bio-behavioral effects in infant rats during the hours after separation from their mothers, and defined the mechanisms for these effects as withdrawal (i.e. loss) of numerous unexpected regulators of infant physiology and behavior that he found within the sensorimotor, thermal and nutrient-based interactions between mothers and their infants. The discovery of these ‚Äúhidden regulators‚Äù added a new dimension to the concept of early attachment.Sullivan R, Perry R, Sloan R, Kleinhaus K, Burtchen, N (2011) ‚ÄúInfant bonding and attachment to the caregiver: Insights from basic and clinical science‚Äù ‚ÄúClin.

The company is best known for tax-free shopping, a VAT/GST refund product and also operates in dynamic currency conversion, marketing services, point-of-sale technology, retail staff education, and customer intelligence. It is the industry leader for providing tax refunds, with Premier Tax Free as its closest competitor. As of 2014, some 130 countries levy VAT/GST, about 50 offer to refund VAT/GST to tourists for private exports. History Started in Sweden in 1980, tax-free shopping is about refunding the VAT/GST levied in normal stores on the high street to non-resident visitors who will privately export the goods purchased, according to the legislation in the European Union and other countries; tax-free shopping is not to be confused with duty-free, which started in Ireland in 1947 and relates to specific stores (most often located in travel-related environments such as airports) that are exempt from the payment of certain local or national taxes and duties. Founded as Sweden Tax Free Shopping, the company later became Europe Tax Free Shopping and then Global Refund in 1998. The company was bought out by its management in partnership with Apax Partners, which took a majority stake, and FEXCO for ¬£118 million in 1999. Global Refund moved headquarters from Kungsbacka, near Gothenburg in Sweden, to Nyon, in the Lake Geneva area, in 2001 for a more central position in Europe to manage its business then gone global but with a strong merchant customer base in European tourist destination countries. In 2007, Apax sold the company to Equistone Partners Europe (at the time Barclays Private Equity), which valued the company at ‚Ç¨360 million. Previously operating the two brands Tax Free Shopping and First Currency Choice, Global Refund completed its repositioning, product diversification and rebranding as Global Blue in 2010. Equistone Partners sold the business in May 2012, for 1 billion euros to the technology private equity firm Silver Lake, with Swiss private equity house Partners Group taking a minority stake. On 10 April 2014 Global Blue announced the appointment of David Baxby as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors, taking over from Per Setterberg, who had run the company for 25 years. Following David Baxby a new CEO, Jaques Stern, has been announced on 18 May 2015.

She wrote the first program to run on EDSAC, co-wrote the first compiler for Toronto's Ferranti Mark 1, wrote numerous papers in computer science, and taught computers and engineering at Queen's University and the University of Toronto for over 20 years before her untimely death at the age of 50. Early life Beatrice was born on 18 October 1921 to Joel and Beatrice Marie (nee Trinker). Joel was born in 1887 to a working-class family in Ashton-Under-Lyne, Manchester. Beatrice Marie's grandparents had started a textile mill in Xia, Mexico, in the 1850s, and in 1908 Joel and Beatrice Marie moved to work at the plant. The plant was destroyed by rebels around 1917 and Joel took a job in El Salto with Rio Grande group's CIMSA mills, rising to become the general manager. Beatrice Marie gave birth to a son in 1920, Charles Robert, and then Beatrice Helen the next year. The two were homeschooled for security reasons, having little interaction with their neighbours. In 1929, Joel moved the family to Toronto to provide better schooling for his children. Charles entered Upper Canada College, while Beatrice started at Brown Public School, but moved to Bishop Strachan School in 1935. Bishop Strachan offered two tracks, and Beatrice enrolled in the more difficult university prep courses. She excelled to the point that the headmaster stated she was one of the best students to attend the school. She graduated in 1939 with awards in maths, science, and for having the highest overall grade, earned the Governor General's Award. Undergraduate studies Worsley won the Burnside Scholarship in Science from Trinity College, part of the University of Toronto, and began studies in September 1939. Her high marks won her the first Alexander T. Fulton Scholarship in Science. For her second year she transferred to the Mathematics and Physics division, an applied program rather than theoretical. In her third year, Worsley won the James Scott Scholarship in Mathematics and Physics. Graduating in 1944 in mathematics and physics with a Bachelor of Arts, she had the distinction of earning the highest mark in every class every year. Wartime service Immediately after graduation, Worsley enlisted in the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service, better known as the \\"Wrens\\". After basic training at HMCS Conestoga in Galt (today known as Cambridge, Ontario), she was assigned to the Naval Research Establishment (NRE) in Halifax. She was first tasked with studying harbour defences, then degaussing, and torpedo guidance. When World War II ended, Worsley was the only Wren at the NRE to choose to remain in service. In September 1945 she was promoted to lieutenant and put on a new research project on hull corrosion. Over the next year she spent 150 days at sea, many of them on the NRE's Bangor-class minesweeper, HMCS Quinte, setting a record for Wrens that stands to this day. Most of this took place during the terrible conditions of the Canadian Atlantic winter, earning her the respect of the crew doing what she herself referred to as a \\"man's job\\". She was officially demobilized in August 1946. Post-graduate at MIT Immediately after leaving the Wrens, Worsley was accepted to MIT's one-year master's program in mathematics and physics. Among her classes was a course in solid-state physics taught by L√°szl√≥ Tisza, and a course on feedback amplifiers and servomechanisms, an area in which MIT was a world leader. Her thesis on A Mathematical Survey of Computing Devices with an Appendix on Error Analysis of Differential Analyzers was completed under the direction of Henry Wallman, a member of the famed MIT Radiation Laboratory. The paper covered almost every computing machine then in existence. Among the many machines discussed were the Harvard Mark I and Mark II, several IBM mechanical and electromechanical calculating machines, Bell Labs' relay based digital computers, ENIAC, EDVAC, the IAS machine, Whirlwind I and II, and EDSAC. The appendix covered a number of differential analyzer systems and examined their sources of errors. It remains one of the most detailed accounts of early computing. Computation Centre in Toronto After writing her thesis, Worsley returned to Canada and told her family that the future was in computers. Unfortunately, there was no computing industry in Canada at that time, and she took a job with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), where she worked in the aerodynamics department. Through this period, the University of Toronto had been setting plans to open a computing department, both as a research facility at the university and as a service bureau, renting time on the machines to commercial and government users. In September 1947 the first funds were provided by the NRC to purchase two IBM punch card mechanical calculators and two assistants to run them. Worsley heard of the effort and applied to the position, having been at the NRC only a few months. She joined the new department in January 1948. One of her first jobs at the Centre was a contract with Atomic Energy of Canada (AECL) to provide computational support, along with staff advisor Kelly Gotlieb and J. Perham Stanley, another assistant hired at the same time as Worsley. During the summer of 1948, she built a differential analyzer from Meccano parts, similar to the one described by Hartree and Arthur Porter in 1935. Little information on this analyzer survives; a second model, or perhaps a rebuild of the original, was built by students in 1951. Cambridge With the analyzer completed, Worsley and Stanley were sent to the UK to learn what they could of the EDSAC design, then under construction at Cambridge University's Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory. They arrived to find the machine nearly completed, and helped where they could to bring it online for its first test run on 6 May 1949. The first program to run successfully on the machine was one Worsley helped write for calculating squares, and she later collected this and a number of similar programs into one of the earliest papers on the topic, The E.D.S.A.C. Demonstration. The next month, a meeting was held at Cambridge on the topic of computing machines, and Worsley prepared a report on the program that produced squares, and a new one that produced tables of prime numbers. The report included sample output, as well as a description of the code and how it was run on the machine. This was printed in the conference proceedings, and was picked up years later by Brian Randell for his famous 1973 book, The Origins of Digital Computers. This made Worsley well known in the computing field long after the events. Worsley then began her PhD at Newnham College. While working at the Lab, she attended courses on quantum physics with Paul Dirac, John Lennard-Jones and Nicholas Kemmer, number theory with Albert Ingham, and perhaps most importantly, numerical analysis with Douglas Hartree. She began writing her dissertation under Hartree, who coincidentally also supervised another Canadian woman, Charlotte Fischer. In the midst of this work, for unknown reasons, Worsley returned to Toronto and continued her dissertation under UofT maths professor Byron Griffith. Shortly thereafter she was rehired by the Computation Centre in July 1951. Hartree approved the dissertation and Worsley received her doctorate in 1952. Her paper, Serial Programming for Real and Idealized Digital Calculating Machines, is considered to be the first PhD dissertation written about modern computers. It included a number of discussions about numerical calculations on Turing machines as well as real-world examples, notably EDSAC. It then went on to describe methods for recognizing which machine instructions were required, and which could be accomplished by combinations of other instructions. Both Turing and Claude Shannon had discussed idealized versions of this concept, but Worsley's contribution was to demonstrate the most efficient way to do this, not a single generalized solution as in Shannon's case. FERUT and Transcode During the summer of 1948, the Computing Centre approached the NRC with plans to build a copy of Bell Labs' Mark 6 relay-based digital computer. Given a tentative go-ahead, they approached Northern Electric to obtain blueprints for the design, and were told there would be a license fee of $25,000 (). They returned to the NRC in March 1949 for an additional $50,000 for the license and construction costs, but the NRC wisely told them to drop these plans and build an electronic version instead. Together, the university and NRC planned an ambitious program to build a first-rate computer to be used by NRC, the Defense Research Board and industry. Known as UTEC, construction began in 1951 but quickly ran into serious problems due to the unreliability of their Williams tube memory systems. It was not until late that year that the system was finally reliable enough to be used. At this point the Centre approached the NCR for funding to complete the system with a parallel math unit. AECL had been growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of a usable machine, and when they heard NRC had been approached to continue UTEC development they suggested the funds would be better spent buying a complete machine. Bennett Lewis of AECL was aware that Ferranti had built a complete Ferranti Mark 1 machine for AECLs counterparts in the UK, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, only to be left holding it when the incoming government cancelled its funding. This was available for only $30,000 (), about the same as the first round of funding required for the expanded UTEC. The machine was purchased in early 1952 and arrived in early 1952, before Worsley rejoined the Centre. She was aware of the machine's arrival, and christened it FERUT for \\"Ferranti Electronic computer at the University of Toronto\\". The machine was operational by the summer, providing the UofT with one of the most powerful computers in the world. In the fall of 1953, Worsley and Patterson Hume began development of a new computer language for the machine known as Transcode. This was similar to Autocode being developed by Alick Glennie at the University of Manchester for the same machine, but took advantage of several design notes of the Mark I to produce a faster and somewhat easier to use language. One major advantage was the conversion from decimal to binary and back, which allowed programmers to enter numbers in decimal form. Queen's University In spite of impressive credentials from Cambridge, a series of well respected papers, and several firsts in the industry, Worsley was repeatedly passed over for promotion within the University of Toronto. It was not until 1960 that she was promoted from a staff member to an assistant professor, and not until 1964 that she was promoted to assistant professor of physics and computer science. In comparison to the other members of the early days of the Computation Center, she received far less recognition. In 1965, Worsley was offered a job at Queen's University, launching their new Computer Centre based on an IBM 1620. At Queen's her duties turned more to teaching, and took up most of her time by 1971. In September of that year, after 20 years in the field, she took a sabbatical at the Department of Applied Analysis and Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. On 8 May 1972, in Waterloo, Worsley suffered a fatal heart attack. Awards In 2014, Worsley was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award in Computer Science by the Canadian Association of Computer Science.

Typically, this is an orbit in which, over a long period of time, the satellite's altitude remains constant at the same point in each orbit. Changes in the inclination, position of the lowest point of the orbit, and eccentricity have been minimized by choosing initial values so that their perturbations cancel out. This results in a long- term stable orbit that minimizes the use of station-keeping propellant. Background and motivation For most spacecraft, changes to orbits are caused by the oblateness of the Earth, gravitational attraction from the sun and moon, solar radiation pressure, and air drag. These are called \\"perturbing forces\\". They must be counteracted by maneuvers to keep the spacecraft in the desired orbit. For a geostationary spacecraft, correction maneuvers on the order of 40‚Äì50 m/s per year are required to counteract the gravitational forces from the sun and moon which move the orbital plane away from the equatorial plane of the Earth. For sun-synchronous spacecraft, intentional shifting of the orbit plane (called \\"precession\\") can be used for the benefit of the mission. For these missions, a near-circular orbit with an altitude of 600‚Äì900 km is used. An appropriate inclination (97.8-99.0 degrees) is selected so that the precession of the orbital plane is equal to the rate of movement of the Earth around the sun, about 1 degree per day. As a result, the spacecraft will pass over points on the Earth that have the same time of day during every orbit. For instance, if the orbit is \\"square to the sun\\", the vehicle will always pass over points at which it is 6 a.m. on the north-bound portion, and 6 p.m. on the south-bound portion (or vice versa). This is called a \\"Dawn-Dusk\\" orbit. Alternatively, if the sun lies in the orbital plane, the vehicle will always pass over places where it is midday on the north-bound leg, and places where it is midnight on the south-bound leg (or vice versa). These are called \\"Noon-Midnight\\" orbits. Such orbits are desirable for many Earth observation missions such as weather, imagery, and mapping. The perturbing force caused by the oblateness of the Earth will in general perturb not only the orbital plane but also the eccentricity vector of the orbit. There exists, however, an almost circular orbit for which there are no secular/long periodic perturbations of the eccentricity vector, only periodic perturbations with period equal to the orbital period. Such an orbit is then perfectly periodic (except for the orbital plane precession) and it is therefore called a \\"frozen orbit\\". Such an orbit is often the preferred choice for an Earth observation mission where repeated observations of the same area of the Earth should be made under as constant observation conditions as possible. The Earth observation satellites ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat are operated in sun-synchronous frozen orbits. =Lunar frozen orbits= Through a study of many lunar orbiting satellites, scientists have discovered that most low lunar orbits (LLO) are unstable.Frozen Orbits About the Moon. 2003 Four frozen lunar orbits have been identified at 27¬∞, 50¬∞, 76¬∞, and 86¬∞ inclination. NASA expounded on this in 2006: > Lunar mascons make most low lunar orbits unstable ... As a satellite passes > 50 or 60 miles overhead, the mascons pull it forward, back, left, right, or > down, the exact direction and magnitude of the tugging depends on the > satellite's trajectory.

[There > are] a number of 'frozen orbits' where a spacecraft can stay in a low lunar > orbit indefinitely. They occur at four inclinations: 27¬∞, 50¬∞, 76¬∞, and > 86¬∞\\"‚Äîthe last one being nearly over the lunar poles. The orbit of the > relatively long-lived Apollo 15 subsatellite PFS-1 had an inclination of > 28¬∞, which turned out to be close to the inclination of one of the frozen > orbits‚Äîbut less fortunate PFS-2 had an orbital inclination of only 11¬∞. Classical theory The classical theory of frozen orbits is essentially based on the analytical perturbation analysis for artificial satellites of Dirk Brouwer made under contract with NASA and published in 1959.Dirk Brouwer: \\"Solution of the Problem of the Artificial Satellite Without Drag\\", Astronomical Journal, 64 (1959) This analysis can be carried out as follows: In the article orbital perturbation analysis the secular perturbation of the orbital pole Delta hat{z}, from the J_2, term of the geopotential model is shown to be which can be expressed in terms of orbital elements thus: Making a similar analysis for the J_3, term (corresponding to the fact that the earth is slightly pear shaped), one gets which can be expressed in terms of orbital elements as In the same article the secular perturbation of the components of the eccentricity vector caused by the J_2, is shown to be: where: * The first term is the in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector caused by the in- plane component of the perturbing force * The second term is the effect of the new position of the ascending node in the new orbital plane, the orbital plane being perturbed by the out-of-plane force component Making the analysis for the J_3, term one gets for the first term, i.e. for the perturbation of the eccentricity vector from the in-plane force component For inclinations in the range 97.8‚Äì99.0 deg, the DeltaOmega, value given by () is much smaller than the value given by () and can be ignored. Similarly the quadratic terms of the eccentricity vector components in () can be ignored for almost circular orbits, i.e. () can be approximated with Adding the J_3, contribution 2pi frac{J_3}{mu p^3} frac{3}{2} sin i left(frac{5}{4} sin^2 i - 1right)  (1, 0) to () one gets Now the difference equation shows that the eccentricity vector will describe a circle centered at the point left( 0, -frac{J_3 sin i}{J_2 2 p} right),; the polar argument of the eccentricity vector increases with -2pi frac {J_2}{mu p^2} 3 left(frac{5}{4} sin^2 i - 1right), radians between consecutive orbits. As :mu = 398600.440text{ km}^3/s^2 , :J_2 = 1.7555 10^{10}text{ km}^5/s^2 , :J_3 = -2.619 10^{11}text{ km}^6/s^2 , one gets for a polar orbit ( i = 90^circ,) with p = 7200text{ km}, that the centre of the circle is at (0, 0.001036), and the change of polar argument is 0.00400 radians per orbit. The latter figure means that the eccentricity vector will have described a full circle in 1569 orbits. Selecting the initial mean eccentricity vector as (0, 0.001036), the mean eccentricity vector will stay constant for successive orbits, i.e. the orbit is frozen because the secular perturbations of the J_2, term given by () and of the J_3, term given by () cancel out. In terms of classical orbital elements, this means that a frozen orbit should have the following mean elements: :e = -frac{J_3 sin i}{J_2 2 p}, :omega = 90^circ, Modern theory The modern theory of frozen orbits is based on the algorithm given in a 1989 article by Mats Rosengren. For this the analytical expression () is used to iteratively update the initial (mean) eccentricity vector to obtain that the (mean) eccentricity vector several orbits later computed by the precise numerical propagation takes precisely the same value. In this way the secular perturbation of the eccentricity vector caused by the J_2, term is used to counteract all secular perturbations, not only those (dominating) caused by the J_3, term. One such additional secular perturbation that in this way can be compensated for is the one caused by the solar radiation pressure, this perturbation is discussed in the article \\"Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)\\". Applying this algorithm for the case discussed above, i.e. a polar orbit ( i=90^circ,) with p=7200text{ km}, ignoring all perturbing forces other than the J_2, and the J_3, forces for the numerical propagation one gets exactly the same optimal average eccentricity vector as with the \\"classical theory\\", i.e. (0, 0.001036),. When we also include the forces due to the higher zonal terms the optimal value changes to (0, 0.001285),. Assuming in addition a reasonable solar pressure (a \\"cross-sectional-area\\" of , the direction to the sun in the direction towards the ascending node) the optimal value for the average eccentricity vector becomes (0.000069, 0.001285), which corresponds to :omega = 87^circ,, i.e. the optimal value is not omega = 90^circ anymore. This algorithm is implemented in the orbit control software used for the Earth observation satellites ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat Derivation of the closed form expressions for the J3 perturbation The main perturbing force to be counteracted in order to have a frozen orbit is the \\"J_3, force\\", i.e. the gravitational force caused by an imperfect symmetry north/south of the Earth, and the \\"classical theory\\" is based on the closed form expression for this \\"J_3, perturbation\\". With the \\"modern theory\\" this explicit closed form expression is not directly used but it is certainly still worthwhile to derive it. The derivation of this expression can be done as follows: The potential from a zonal term is rotational symmetric around the polar axis of the Earth and corresponding force is entirely in a longitudinal plane with one component F_r hat{r}, in the radial direction and one component F_lambda hat{lambda}, with the unit vector hat{lambda}, orthogonal to the radial direction towards north. These directions hat{r}, and hat{lambda}, are illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1: The unit vectors hat{phi}, hat{lambda}, hat{r} In the article Geopotential model it is shown that these force components caused by the J_3, term are To be able to apply relations derived in the article Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft) the force component F_lambda hat{lambda}, must be split into two orthogonal components F_t hat{t} and F_z hat{z} as illustrated in figure 2 Figure 2: The unit vector hat{t}, orthogonal to hat{r}, in the direction of motion and the orbital pole hat{z},. The force component F_lambda is marked as \\"F\\" Let hat{a}, hat{b}, hat{n}, make up a rectangular coordinate system with origin in the center of the Earth (in the center of the Reference ellipsoid) such that hat{n}, points in the direction north and such that hat{a}, hat{b}, are in the equatorial plane of the Earth with hat{a}, pointing towards the ascending node, i.e. towards the blue point of Figure 2. The components of the unit vectors :hat{r}, hat{t}, hat{z}, making up the local coordinate system (of which hat{t}, hat{z}, are illustrated in figure 2), and expressing their relation with hat{a}, hat{b}, hat{n},, are as follows: :r_a= cos u, :r_b= cos i  sin u, :r_n= sin i  sin u, :t_a=-sin u, :t_b= cos i  cos u, :t_n= sin i  cos u, :z_a= 0, :z_b=-sin i, :z_n= cos i, where u, is the polar argument of hat{r}, relative the orthogonal unit vectors hat{g}=hat{a}, and hat{h}=cos i hat{b} + sin i hat{n}, in the orbital plane Firstly :sin lambda = r_n = sin i  sin u, where lambda, is the angle between the equator plane and hat{r}, (between the green points of figure 2) and from equation (12) of the article Geopotential model one therefore obtains Secondly the projection of direction north, hat{n},, on the plane spanned by hat{t}, hat{z}, is :sin i  cos u  hat{t} + cos i  hat{z}, and this projection is :cos lambda  hat{lambda}, where hat{lambda}, is the unit vector hat{lambda} orthogonal to the radial direction towards north illustrated in figure 1. From equation () we see that :F_lambda  hat{lambda} = -J_3 frac{1}{r^5} frac{3}{2} left(5 sin^2lambda -1right) coslambda hat{lambda} = -J_3 frac{1}{r^5} frac{3}{2} left(5 sin^2lambda -1right) (sin i  cos u  hat{t} + cos i  hat{z}), and therefore: In the article Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft) it is further shown that the secular perturbation of the orbital pole hat{z}, is Introducing the expression for F_z, of () in () one gets The fraction frac{p}{r}, is :frac {p}{r} = 1 + e cdot cos theta = 1 + e_g cdot cos u + e_h cdot sin u where :e_g = e cos omega :e_h = e sin omega are the components of the eccentricity vector in the hat{g}, hat{h}, coordinate system. As all integrals of type :intlimits_{0}^{2pi} cos^m u  sin^n u du, are zero if not both n, and m, are even, we see that and It follows that where :hat{g}, and hat{h}, are the base vectors of the rectangular coordinate system in the plane of the reference Kepler orbit with hat{g}, in the equatorial plane towards the ascending node and u, is the polar argument relative this equatorial coordinate system :f_z, is the force component (per unit mass) in the direction of the orbit pole hat{z}, In the article Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft) it is shown that the secular perturbation of the eccentricity vector is where *hat{r},hat{t}, is the usual local coordinate system with unit vector hat{r}, directed away from the Earth *V_r = sqrt{frac {mu}{p}} cdot e cdot sin theta  the velocity component in direction hat{r}, *V_t = sqrt{frac {mu}{p}} cdot (1 + e cdot cos theta)  the velocity component in direction hat{t}, Introducing the expression for F_r, F_t, of () and () in () one gets Using that :frac {V_r}{V_t} = frac {e_g cdot sin u - e_h cdot cos u}{frac {p}{r}} the integral above can be split in 8 terms: Given that :hat{r}=cos u hat{g} + sin u hat{h} :hat{t}=-sin u hat{g} + cos u hat{h} we obtain :frac {p}{r} = 1 + e cdot cos theta = 1 + e_g cdot cos u + e_h cdot sin u and that all integrals of type :intlimits_{0}^{2pi} cos^m u  sin^n u du, are zero if not both n, and m, are even: Term 1 Term 2 Term 3 Term 4 Term 5 Term 6 Term 7 Term 8 As It follows that References Further reading * STUDY OF ORBITAL ELEMENTS ON THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF A FROZEN ORBIT. including atmospheric drag and J5 terms Astrodynamics Orbits Spaceflight concepts ","title":"Frozen orbit"},{"id":"31516480","text":"Halifax County Public Schools is a school district serving Halifax County, Virginia.

He was appointed by John E. Develin as Assistant Corporation Counsel of New York City. As such, in 1862, Hackett contested John Kelly's claim for $20,000 sheriff's fees, thus gaining Kelly's enmity. Hackett was still in office when Recorder John T. Hoffman took office as Mayor of New York City on January 1, 1866. To fill the vacancy proved difficult, the Board of Supervisors of New York County having six Republicans and six Democrats. On March 6, 1866, after more than two months of deadlock, Hackett was elected Recorder of New York City, and was elected to succeed himself for a full three-year term, running on the Tammany ticket in November 1866. In November 1869, he was re-elected on the Tammany ticket, the term having been extended to six years in the meanwhile. Hackett was responsible for doing some of the judicial bidding of ward chiefs. During a period that lasted almost 2 years, Hackett dismissed 170 court cases. After succeeding William M. Tweed as boss of Tammany Hill, Kelly launched a personal attack on Hackett, and on October 12, 1875, had Frederick Smyth nominated for Recorder. The next day, Hackett was nominated on the Republican ticket, and then endorsed by the Anti-Tammany Democrats. Defeating Smyth, he was elected to a fourteen-year term, the term having been extended again, to match the duration of the term of the other judges and justices of the various courts in New York. In 1878, Hackett began to suffer from a prolonged illness, and spent a two-month-long summer vacation in Europe. Although at first slightly improving, his health deteriorated again, so that Hackett sat for the last time as judge on the bench of the Court of General Sessions on October 1, 1878. In August 1879, he caught a severe cold while on a hunting and fishing trip around Islip, Long Island, which evolved into bronchitis, pericarditis and dropsy. Five months later, he died at his residence, 72 Park Avenue (Manhattan), without having recovered his health. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx). The actor James Keteltas Hackett (1869‚Äì1926) was his half- brother. In 1914, James inherited the larger part of the estate, valued at $1,389,049.46, from his niece Minnie who aged 57 had married Francis Emory Trowbridge (1845‚Äì1910), and died without issue.

Kyle Smith of New York Post gave this film 1 out of 4 stars and said that \\"Mia and the Migoo\\" is far too childish to intrigue adults yet too slow and dull for kids. Shawn Levy of The Oregonian gave this film a C- and wrote, \\"It's lovely, truly, but so heavy-handed and slipshod that it's probably best enjoyed with the sound off -- an option they're not likely to offer at the movie theater\\". On the positive side, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave this film a 3/5 stars and said that \\"trying to parse meaning in \\"Mia\\" is secondary to its main point, which is its look, created with 500,000 hand- drawn frames\\".

In Greek mythology, Polybotes (Pah-Leh-Boh-Teez) () was one of the Giants, the offspring of Gaia (Earth), and Uranus (Sky). He fought Poseidon during the Gigantomachy, the war between the Giants and the gods.Arafat, pp. 16, 25. Mythology Polybotes was one of the Gigantes (Giants), the offspring of Gaia, born from the blood that fell when Uranus was castrated by their son Cronus.For the birth of the Gigantes see Hesiod, Theogony 185. Hyginus, Fabulae Preface gives Tartarus as the father of the Giants. According to the mythographer Apollodorus, during the Gigantomachy, the cosmic battle of the Giants with the Olympian gods, Polybotes was crushed under Nisyros, a piece of the island of Kos broken off and thrown by Poseidon:Apollodorus, 1.6.2. Compare with Homer, Odyssey 4.499-4.511 where Poseidon breaks off a piece of the island Gyrae with his trident, sending the boasting Greek Hero Ajax the Lesser to the bottom of the ocean, where he drowned. :Polybotes was chased through the sea by Poseidon and came to Cos; and Poseidon, breaking off that piece of the island which is called Nisyrum, threw it on him. The first- century BC geographer Strabo also records the story of Polybotes buried under Nisyros (or Kos itself):Strabo, 10.5.16. :They say that Nisyros is a fragment of Cos, and they add the myth that Poseidon, when he was pursuing one of the giants, Polybotes, broke off a fragment of Cos with his trident and hurled it upon him, and the missile became an island, Nisyros, with the giant lying beneath it. But some say that he lies beneath Cos. The mention of a millstone, in a poem fragment by the seventh-century BC poet Alcman may be an early reference to the island of Nisyros.Alcman fragment 1 Poetarum melicorum Graecorum fragmenta, see Ferrari, pp. 28, 151 ff.; Hanfmann, pp. 476; Vian and Moore 1988, p. 192. The second-century AD geographer Pausanias mentions seeing at Athens a statue of Poseidon battling Polybotes:Pausanias, 1.2.4. :Not far from the temple is Poseidon on horseback, hurling a spear against the giant Polybotes, concerning whom is prevalent among the Coans the story about the promontory of Chelone. Poseidon attacks Polybotes in the presence of Gaia, red-figure cup late fifth-century BC (Antikensammlung Berlin F2531) In another version of the story, after being struck by Zeus, Polybotes swam away, Poseidon threw a trident at him but missed and the trident became the island of Nisyros or Porphyris.Cook, pp. 14; Carvounis, p. 250 note 29. Polybotes is named on two sixth-century BC black-figure pots.Getty 81.AE.211 (Moore, pp. 30-31; Beazley Archive 10047) and Louvre E732 (Gantz, p. 451; Cook, p. 14; Beazley Archive 14590, LIMC Gigantes 170 image 4/4 ). Polybotes was possible also named on a sixth-century BC black-figure cup: Akropolis 1632 (Beazley Archive 15673, LIMC Gigantes 110 ).

On the other, an amphora (Louvre E732), he is opposed by Poseidon who is carrying the island of Nisyros on his left shoulder, ready to hurl it against the Giant. The scene depicted on the amphora: Poseidon with trident in his right hand and the island on his left shoulder, moving from left to right, fighting a Giant (mostly unnamed but usually presumed to be Polybotes, although one fifth- century BC example names the Giant Ephialtes) is a frequent occurrence in sixth and fifth-century BC Greek vase paintings.Gantz, 453; Cook, pp. 14-18; Frazer (Vol II), note to Pausanias 1.2.4 \\"Poseidon on horseback hurling a spear at the giant Polybotes\\" pp. 48-49.

A member of the influential avant-garde Zenit movement of the 1920s, he is considered to be a pioneer of surrealism and abstract art in Croatia. In 1969, he received the Vladimir Nazor Award for lifetime achievement in architecture.  Biography  Josip Seissel was born on January 10, 1904 in Krapina, then in Austria- Hungary, now Croatia. Under the name Jo Klek, Seissel was a major contributor to the avant-garde Zenit movement between 1922 and 1925. From his youth, Seissel had been interested in the theatre. He began as a self-taught artist creating drawings, temperas, watercolours and theatrical designs for Zenit productions, including set designs, costumes and posters. From 1921 he began using the pseudonyms Jo Klek and Josip Klek for his artwork. In 1922 he was one of the founders of the group Traveler (Traveleri). He represented Zenit at international exhibitions in the 1920s (Belgrade, Bucharest, and Moscow), Seissel studied at the Technical Faculty in Zagreb under H. Ehrlich, earning a degree in architecture in 1929. He worked at the Department for the Regulation of Zagreb (Odsjeku za regulaciju grada Zagreba), and later became the director of the School of Applied Arts (Obrtne ≈°kole). Following the Second World War, he worked at the Ministry of Construction (Ministarstvu graƒëevina), and from 1965 was a professor at the Faculty of Architecture at Zagreb University. In 1937 he received the Grand Prix and the Order of the Legion of Honor from the French government for designing the Yugoslav pavilion for the World Exhibition in Paris. In 1962 Seissel became a full member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 1969, he received the Vladimir Nazor Award for lifetime achievement in architecture. Josip Seissel died on February 19, 1987 in Zagreb.  Legacy  As an architect, Seissel was involved in urban planning for parts of Zagreb, as well as studies for other regions such as Makarska, Ba≈°ko Polje, ≈†ibenik, Mljet and Nik≈°iƒá. In addition, he worked on plans for Miro≈°evac cemetery, Maksimir Park, Plitvice Lakes and other projects. As a teacher at the Zagreb Faculty of Architecture, he influenced the next generations of urban planners. In addition to his career as an architect, Seissel was active in the avant-garde art movement in Zagreb from the 1920s, most notably related to Zenit magazine. As Jo Klek, his designs are considered to be the beginning of Croatian constructivism, and his collage \\"Pafama\\" in 1922, is considered to be the first abstract (non-representational) of Croatian modern art. This work had a long-lasting impact on Croatian art of the 20th century, especially during the later neo-constructivist movements of the 1950s and 1960s. Seissel used collage and montage techniques to create his designs without reference to historical or literary subjects. He experimented with geometric forms, creating abstract shapes and exploring spaces. His constructivist forms have geometrical designs and interlocking planes, for which he used modern transparent materials that allowed light to become a contributing element. By the 1930s, Seissel's art was approaching surrealism. Seissel's collage \\"Parfama\\" (1922) is an early example of how he combined the constructivist elements of form, colour, space and material. The name Pafama is an abbreviated form of the German Papier-Farben-Malerei, meaning Paper- Colour-Painting. As an illustrator, Seissel was responsible for the graphic design and layout of some editions of Zenit magazine, the constructivist design of Marijan Mikac's books, and he also created the Zenit exhibition poster. Much of Seissel's art uses words to convey an ironic message, and his use of humour was a distinctive characteristic of his work. His mainly surrealist art, created over half a century includes drawings, watercolours, pastels, tempera and collages. His best-known series consists of 19 verbo- visual works in watercolour, ink and tempera called 3C i triƒçarije (a play on words that is difficult to translate). In 1987 Seissel's widow, Silvana Seissel, donated a substantial body of his artistic works from his surrealist period, including paintings, drawings and posters to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb. The museum already had in its collection some major works from his earlier Zenit period created under the name Jo Klek. In 1992, a further bequest added his architectural, urban planning and written works. In total, the collection consists of around 3,000 works, spanning his careers both in art and architecture from the 1920s up until his death in 1987.

He was the top general under the command of King Alaungpaya, his childhood friend. He conquered Dagon in May 1755, which later became the city of Yangon. He died in action during the battle of Syriam in July 1756. He was buried with highest honors. Alaungpaya posthumously awarded his old friend the title of Agga Maha Thenapati (), the highest honor possible for a commoner. Early life He was born Shwe Kaung (more commonly known as Maung Kaung or simply Nga Kaung) in a small village of Moksobo (present-day Shwebo) in Upper Burma circa 1714. He was a childhood friend of Aung Zeya who was a son of chief of Moksobo. Military career In 1752, Kaung joined his friend Aung Zeya's fledgling resistance force to resist the occupation armies of the southern kingdom of Hanthawaddy, which had toppled the Toungoo Dynasty at Ava (Inwa). Aung Zeya claimed himself king, and assumed the title of Alaungpaya. Kaung was chosen as one of the Sixty Eight Commanders in Alaungpaya's army. He was among the first seven of the sixty eight to win a title of valor with the title of Minkyaw Pyanchi for the successful defense of Shwebo (as their once little village was now known) against a major Hanthawaddy siege.Alaungpaya Ayedawbon, pp. 34-35 =Upper Burma and Shan States= Kaung proved to be an able commander, winning many battles in Upper Burma and more titles. By mid-1754, he had been awarded Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw, by which he would be known thenceforth, and had been given the command of the Musket Corps of the army.Alaungpaya Ayedawbon, pp. 42-43 With Upper Burma driven out of Hanthawaddy armies, Alaungpaya sent Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw and his Musket Corps to the Shan States to secure the allegiance of the nearer Shan States.Alaungpaya Ayedawbon, p. 87 (The farther Shan States, in present-day northern Kachin State, northern Shan State, southern Yunnan, remained out of reach.) After a show of force, Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw secured the allegiance of the Shan States. More importantly, he secured contingents of Shan levies for the upcoming invasion of Lower Burma. =Invasion of Lower Burma= By January 1755, at the eve of Alaungpaya's invasion of Lower Burma, he had been awarded Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw, by which he would be known thenceforth, and was the chief of the Musket Corps of the army. Alaungpaya's armies swept the western-side of Lower Burma, capturing Prome (Pyay) and the Irrawaddy delta by the end of April. In early May, Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw's musket corps led the capture the important town of Dagon (present-day Yangon) opposite the main seaport of Syriam (Thanlyin). For his success at Yangon, Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw was awarded the title of Maha Thenapati, (lit. Great Commander). =Battle of Syriam= Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw was given the overall command to take Syriam, with 5000 men and 100 war boats. But Syriam, which was defended by the French personnel and arms, repelled several Konbaung charges. Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw had to defend against a Hanthawaddy attack to retake Yangon in June. For the rest of 1755, no side made any gains, and the siege continued. In July 1756, Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw personally led another Konbaung attack by water and by land. While the Konbaung forces captured the only French ship left at the port, and further tightened the noose of the starving city, their lead general was severely wounded by mortar fire. The dying general was brought back by boat to the other bank, where Alaungpaya and the rest of army was watching the battle. Alaungpaya had already heard of the news, and waiting right by the bank. As the boat approached the bank, the king discarded royal protocol and waded into the water to see his old friend, who had won him many battles. In Alaungpaya's hands, the general was said to have said \\"he was deeply sorry he would have to leave first\\". He died soon afterwards, while doctors were trying to save him. The king publicly mourned the death of his chief general and honored him with a funeral under a white umbrella before the whole army.Alaungpaya Ayedawbon, p. 96Harvey, p. 236 It was 14 July 1756 (3rd waning of Waso 1118 ME).

Plot Papa Smurf's lab explodes while he is making the formula \\"Ad Capitis mala et alios dolores sanandos\\" (which is how much Brainy Smurf is able to read because he is unable to translate it properly like he claims), and when the other Smurfs arrive, Papa Smurf is unconscious. A Smurf goes to the home of the good wizard Homnibus to ask for help. Homnibus realizes that Papa Smurf has fallen sick due to using sulfur in the formula, but he lacks some ingredients needed for the cure, so he sends his servant Oliver to buy some. The Smurf goes along with Oliver and learns about money and the humans' commerce system. The Smurf returns to the Smurf Village with medicine that Papa Smurf must drink three times a day to get better. The Smurf tries to tell Papa Smurf about money, but Papa Smurf needs rest and is unable to listen to him, so the Smurf decides to put the commerce system in practice as a surprise, thus becoming Finance Smurf. The first step is to make coins. Finance Smurf asks Painter Smurf to make a picture of Papa Smurf's face inside a circle, which is then used as a model for Sculptor Smurf to make a mold for the coins. Then Handy Smurf pours molten gold on the mold to make the first Smurf coins. Finance Smurf arranges a conference to explain to the other Smurfs what money is and how it works. Everybody agrees on Finance Smurf's idea to use money from now on (save for Brainy Smurf). Each Smurf gets a bag of money as a start. At first, the inexperienced Smurfs need Finance Smurf's help to know how much do they need to spend or ask for given services, and find the currency system funny, but after some time, trouble begins. While Baker Smurf, Farmer Smurf, Handy Smurf and some other Smurfs get richer, most Smurfs get poor and need to find ways to get money, selling unwanted stuff that they previously did for fun (Jokey Smurf's presents, Harmony Smurf's concerts, Poet Smurf's poems, etc.). Finance Smurf creates and manages a bank to loan money to the poorer Smurfs as well as to store the richer Smurfs' money, but Farmer Smurf doesn't trust the institution and goes to bury his money in the forest, only to encounter Gargamel there. As Farmer Smurf escapes, he drops a coin which is picked up by the evil wizard, who then realizes that the Smurfs have money now. Farmer Smurf notices that he has lost a coin, so he goes to get it back, but when he starts to cross the bridge, it falls apart. Finance Smurf offers to finance the bridge repairs if any Smurf who crosses the bridge from then on pays him a toll. He asks Handy Smurf to get the price for the materials. Carpenter Smurf asks 1500 coins for the wood, which Handy Smurf finds too expensive, so another Smurf offers him inferior wood for just 1000 coins, plus a bribe that Handy accepts. Farmer Smurf returns to the forest to find his lost coin, but Gargamel has planted there lead coins painted yellow as bait that lures the Smurf into a trap. Gargamel then sends his crow Corbelius with a message for the Smurfs to give him all their money in exchange for Farmer Smurf. Papa Smurf, who has recovered, sends a Smurf to spy on Gargamel, and the Smurf spy discovers the wizard setting up a trap in order to get both the Smurfs and their money. The Smurfs fix Gargamel's trap to make it fall on him instead of them. Then, while Finance Smurf and Brainy Smurf carry the money back to the Village, other Smurfs go to Gargamel's house to save Farmer Smurf from Azrael. Papa Smurf decides to have a party to celebrate their triumph, but then Finance Smurf asks who will pay for the party, so at the end there's no party. Papa Smurf learns that he will have to pay a large sum of money to Handy Smurf in order for him to rebuild his destroyed laboratory, but before he can do that he has to pay Smurfette for nursing him during his sickness, Baker Smurf for food, and other Smurfs for various other services, and so he quickly becomes poor. When Finance Smurf suggests that he make the Smurfs pay for any kind of help he gives them, Papa Smurf soundly refuses. Papa Smurf then observes the Village and notes that all the things the Smurfs once did in a cooperative spirit are now done if they are paid only, and there are fights over money as well as stress all around due to the constant work. One day, a Smurf gets sick of the aggravating currency-based life and decides to leave the Smurf Village. Other Smurfs agree and leave with him, even Papa Smurf. In fact, everyone leaves save for Finance Smurf, who tells them they cannot leave because they owe him money. Their response is to throw him all the money back. At first Finance Smurf refuses to revert to the old ways and even gloats about having the whole Village for himself. But eventually, he changes his mind when he decides he doesn't want to be alone, so he asks everybody to return to the village and the old system based on cooperation. The coins are then converted into golden musical instruments. Issues *The subject of the comic book is the famous system that has been implemented on human society: money. Peyo shows us the social differences that grow between the Smurfs (rich and poor). We can also see how the lifestyle of smurfs changes, revolving around money and bringing misery everywhere ... *Also, although the book was never adapted for the television cartoon series, there is an episode entitled \\"The Smurfs and the Money Tree\\" which also revolves around money, namely an enchanted money tree created by Gargamel and his mother to trap the Smurfs. But because Greedy Smurf finds the tree first, instead of actual money, it turns out to carry chocolate coins wrapped in gold with Greedy's image on them. *This is the last comic book story that was worked on by the original Peyo, Pierre Culliford before his death on December 24, 1992. His son Thierry Culliford would take over in creating all Smurf comic book stories from that point onward, mostly in the area of scripting stories with various cartoon artists on hand doing the artwork.

Women from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Mongolia, and Brazil are subjected to forced prostitution in the Czech Republic and also travel through the Czech Republic en route to forced prostitution in other European countries, including Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and Serbia. Many Roma women from the Czech Republic are subjected to forced prostitution domestically as well as abroad. Men and women from Russia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Romania, Vietnam, Mongolia, Thailand, and Belarus are subjected to forced labour in the construction, forestry, agricultural, and service sectors and are exploited within and transited through the Czech Republic to other countries in the European Union. Czech citizens are also subjected to forced labour in the United Kingdom. The Czech government amended its criminal code to increase the maximum penalty for trafficking from 15 to 16 years‚Äô imprisonment, and provides assistance to victims of trafficking both within the Czech Republic and also in source countries, described by the US State Department as \\"excellent\\". In 2009, the government provided approximately $456,000 in funding for its domestic anti-trafficking programs, including $213,000 for victim assistance.\\"Czech Republic\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Czech government's record on law enforcement related to human trafficking is mixed. The Czech Republic prohibits trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation and labour exploitation through Sections 232a and 204 of its criminal code, and punishments prescribed under these statutes range from two to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. In January 2010, a new section of the criminal code ‚Äì Section 166 ‚Äì came into effect and increased the maximum penalty prescribed for trafficking to 16 years. This Section includes some elements that are not considered as human trafficking by all jurisdictions, such as forced military service. In 2009, police conducted 47 investigations ‚Äì including three labour trafficking investigations ‚Äì a decrease from 81 investigations in 2008. The same year authorities prosecuted 115 people for trafficking offences (compared with 110 in 2008), leading to 83 convictions, an increase from 64 in 2008. Of those convicted in 2009, only those convicted under Section 204, related to pimping, were sentenced to time in prison, and the number of convicted traffickers given a prison sentence decreased compared to the previous year. In 2009, only 23 percent (19 out of 83) trafficking offenders convicted served time in prison, down from 28 percent in 2008 (18 out of 64). In 2009, two traffickers were sentenced to between 15 and 25 years in prison, 16 were sentenced to one to five years, and one of those convicted was imprisoned for less than a year. In 2009, the police provided 12 training seminars to 431 seasoned officers and cadets focused on investigation techniques as well as victim identification for both sex and labor trafficking offenses. Protection According to the US State Department, the Czech government makes strong efforts to protect and assist victims of human trafficking, using formal victim identification procedures and a mechanism for referring victims to NGOs for assistance. The government funds a \\"Program of Support and Protection of Victims of Trafficking in Human Beings\\", available for both foreign and Czech victims, and provides for both short-term and longer-term assistance. Foreign and Czech victims are offered an automatic 60-day period of reflection, during which time they receive government-funded assistance through NGO providers while they decide whether to cooperate with law enforcement in the criminal investigation. Victims are encouraged to assist in investigations and prosecutions. Foreign victims who cooperate with investigators after the initial 60-day reflection period are granted temporary residence and work visas for the duration of the relevant legal proceedings. Upon conclusion of the court proceedings, qualifying victims have the opportunity to apply for permanent residency. Victims are not fined or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a result of being trafficked. Prevention According to the US State Department, the government \\"demonstrates sustained, strong efforts to prevent trafficking domestically and it continues to dedicate significant resources to prevent trafficking in designated foreign countries\\". Working together with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocates funding (around $132,500 between January 2008 and April 2010) to NGOs to raise awareness of trafficking among Mongolian labour migrants and protect Mongolian victims of both forced sex and forced labour exploitation in the Czech Republic and of those repatriated to Mongolia. Domestically, the Ministry of Interior funds an NGO to conduct a campaign to raise awareness of forced labour among foreign workers in factories, especially among the Vietnamese community. The government also funds NGOs to conduct general trafficking awareness campaigns in schools and in asylum and migration centers. The government funds a campaign called \\"Say it for Her\\", aimed at reducing the demand for prostitution among foreign tourists visiting the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic became a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol in 2014.https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg;_no=XVIII-12-a&chapter;=18‚ü®=en See also  *Human trafficking in Europe References Czech Republic Czech Republic Human rights abuses in the Czech Republic Crime in the Czech Republic by type ","title":"Human trafficking in the Czech Republic"},{"id":"31516757","text":"Denmark is primarily a transit and destination country for women and children from Baltic countries, East and Central Europe, Nigeria, Thailand, and South America subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution. There was one report last year of a male teenager from Nigeria rescued from the commercial sex trade in Denmark. The government did not report any cases of forced labor during the reporting period, though the Danish Anti- Trafficking Center highlighted that workers in domestic service, restaurants, hotels, factories, and agriculture, may be vulnerable to forced labor in Denmark. There were unconfirmed reports of foreign children being forced to engage in organized street crime. The government released a report in 2010 about increasing evidence that ‚Äúau pair‚Äù organizations could be used as front companies for human trafficking. The hundreds of unaccompanied foreign minors who arrive in Denmark every year are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.\\"Denmark\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The United States Department of State placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in their 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report. Prosecution Denmark prohibits both sex and labor trafficking through Section 262 of its criminal code. Punishments prescribed for trafficking under section 262 extend up to eight years‚Äô imprisonment, are sufficiently stringent, and are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Police reported conducting a total of 44 human trafficking investigations during the reporting period. Using Section 262, the government prosecuted 25 people for sex trafficking and convicted 11 sex trafficking offenders in 2009. The government prosecuted additional alleged sex trafficking offenders under other statutes, such as prostitution procurement. All 11 trafficking offenders convicted in 2009 served some time in prison; none received suspended sentences. Sentences for convicted trafficking offenders ranged from 5 to 42 months‚Äô imprisonment. The Danish national police provided anti-trafficking training to all police precincts and new police recruits during the reporting period, and police leadership has taken a strategic approach to addressing the crime; however, the effectiveness of this training is still undetermined. Protection Denmark sustained its victim assistance and protection efforts over the year. In addition to employing formal victim identification procedures, the government conducted a proactive victim identification outreach program, interviewing people in prostitution, as well as in prisons and asylum centers, in an attempt to identify and rescue trafficking victims. The government identified 54 victims during the reporting period, down from 72 identified the previous year. The government offered medical, dental, psychological, and legal services, and in certain cases a stipend, to victims of trafficking during a 100-day reflection period ‚Äì a time for victims to receive immediate care and assistance while they considered whether to assist law enforcement. There were two government- funded crisis centers for female victims of violence, which accommodated women trafficking victims. There were no specific shelter facilities for male victims, but at least one government-funded NGO offered assistance to men. The government offered child trafficking victims additional social services and placement in shelters or foster care. No support is provided to adult or child foreign victims of trafficking in Denmark beyond the reflection period if asylum or residency is not granted. The government encouraged victims to assist in investigations of their traffickers, including by offering support of trained counselors during police interviews; however, many victims did not cooperate. It has been Danish NGOs‚Äô experience that 100 days is often not enough time for victims to develop sufficient trust in local authorities to disclose details of their trafficking experience. In addition, after the reflection period and trial process, victims of trafficking are most often deported to their country of origin, where authorities may not be able to provide protection. Trafficking victims were eligible to apply for asylum as an alternative to their removal to countries in which they would face retribution or hardship. This year, six people were determined by the Danish Immigration Service to be victims of trafficking and had asylum cases pending during the reporting period; one victim from 2008 was granted asylum in 2009. Police acknowledged factors preventing victims‚Äô cooperation with police, including fear of reprisal from traffickers and the knowledge they were going back to their home country. Denmark sustained partnerships with IOM and NGOs in victims‚Äô countries of origin to facilitate safe repatriation. The government provided foreign unaccompanied minors, regardless of whether or not they were suspected victims of trafficking, with a representative to assist with asylum applications or repatriation; however, it was documented that some children were placed in police custody for arriving with forged documents, a crime often occurring as a direct result of being trafficked. Danish victim advocates reported that Danish police generally respected the rights of victims, but claimed victims have been prosecuted for crimes committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Prevention While there is currently no nationwide government-sponsored anti-trafficking awareness campaign focused on all forms of trafficking, the government continued a campaign begun in 2008 called ‚ÄúWho Pays the Price?‚Äù to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, which may be linked to sex trafficking. The government had an anti-trafficking action plan, and the government produced an annual status report monitoring the previous year‚Äôs developments related to the plan. The government forged anti-trafficking partnerships through its funding of anti-trafficking programs in Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. Danish authorities sustained partnerships with Scandinavian Airlines, the Association of Danish Travel Agents, and Save the Children to disseminate public service announcements against child sex tourism. Denmark established a hotline for trafficking victims and one for information about suspected child sex tourism overseas. The government did not report any prosecutions of its citizens for child sex tourism during the reporting period. The Ministry of Defence provided training on human trafficking to all soldiers prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions.

There is little verifiable data on the human trafficking situation in Djibouti. Large numbers of voluntary economic migrants from Ethiopia and Somalia pass illegally through Djibouti en route to Yemen and other locations in the Middle East; among this group, a small number of women and girls may fall victim to involuntary domestic servitude or forced commercial sexual exploitation after reaching Djibouti City or the Ethiopia-Djibouti trucking corridor. An unknown number of migrants ‚Äì men, women, and children ‚Äì are subjected to conditions of forced labor and forced prostitution after reaching Yemen and other destinations in the Middle East. Djibouti's large refugee population ‚Äì consisting of Somalis, Ethiopians, and Eritreans ‚Äì as well as foreign street children remain vulnerable to various forms of exploitation within the country, including human trafficking. Older street children reportedly act, at times, as pimps for younger children. A small number of girls from impoverished Djiboutian families may engage in prostitution with the encouragement of family members or other persons in prostitution. Members of foreign militaries stationed in Djibouti contribute to the demand for women and girls in prostitution, including trafficking victims. The Government of Djibouti does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Senior officials have identified combating human trafficking as an important priority, sought increased partnerships with other governments and international organizations over the past year, and demonstrated a growing awareness of the distinction between human trafficking and smuggling. The government, however, remains unable to effectively implement all of the protection, prevention, and prosecution components of its anti-trafficking law given its lack of resources. Addressing migrant smuggling and daunting refugee flows remained a main concern, diverting government attention and limited law enforcement resources that might otherwise have been devoted to detecting and responding to forms of trafficking occurring within the country's borders. It is believed, however, that the government's efforts to reduce migrant smuggling to Yemen will ultimately serve to reduce the overall number of such migrants who are vulnerable to situations of human trafficking in the Middle East.\\"Djibouti\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2 Watchlist\\" in 2017. Prosecution The government made significant efforts to bring migrant smugglers to justice during the reporting period, but failed to take law enforcement action against forced labor or sex trafficking offenders. Law 210, \\"Regarding the Fight Against Human Trafficking\\", enacted in December 2007, prohibits both labor and sex trafficking. The law also provides for the protection of victims regardless of ethnicity, gender, or nationality, and prescribes penalties of up to 30 years' imprisonment for convicted trafficking offenders. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. During the reporting period, the Djiboutian military regularly buried the remains of shipwrecked migrants who drowned after failed smuggling attempts. The smugglers of these migrants, when captured by Djiboutian authorities, were transferred to the judicial system for prosecution. The Ministry of Justice reported its use of Law 210 in the past year to prosecute, convict, and sentenced well over 100 illegal migrant smugglers and their accomplices, including Djiboutian citizens. It is unclear whether any of these cases involved human trafficking. The Ministry of Justice reported no investigations or prosecutions of offenses involving forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation. The Brigade des Moeurs (Vice Police) conducted regular nighttime sweeps of the capital's bars and streets and preventatively detained Ethiopian, Somali, and Djiboutian children suspected to be engaged in prostitution. In 2009, police apprehended, but did not charge, 408 girls between the ages of 10 and 18 years in such sweeps; the brigade did not indicate whether it detained the exploiters of these girls. In November 2009, the government requested human trafficking be added to the agenda for regular Djibouti-Ethiopia bilateral talks and proposed a draft memorandum of understanding on the subject. The 15-article agreement commits specific government entities to liaise on trafficking issues, proposes regular meetings, and provides a framework for partnership with Ethiopia on judicial cooperation. Protection With few resources itself and a very small pool of tiny, underfunded NGOs, the government had little means with which to address the needs of trafficking victims during the year. The Council of Ministers took no action in 2009 to ensure comprehensive care for victims, as mandated under Article 18 of Law 210. After detaining children on suspicion of engaging in prostitution, police indicated that they attempted to locate and meet with parents or other family members to discuss appropriate child protection; children were then released to the care of family members without being charged. When family members could not be found, foreign children may have been deported to their country of origin; the government did not report data on such deportations. Police worked with the Ministry of Health's clinic and hospitals, and with NGOs, to provide some medical care to victims of child prostitution. No charges were filed against children detained on suspicion of engaging in prostitution in 2009. The government continued providing protection and accommodation to asylum-seeking defectors from the Eritrean military, some of whom may be trafficking victims. The government has not yet developed a system for proactively identifying victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations or a referral process to transfer such trafficking victims for care. Authorities did not encourage victims to participate in the investigations or prosecutions of their traffickers. Djibouti hosted a meeting of the Somalia Mixed Migration Task Force in July 2009, during which representatives from the Government of Yemen, the Somaliland and Puntland administrations, and international organizations discussed efforts to improve protection for migrants crossing from Somalia and Djibouti to Yemen. Prevention The government's efforts to prevent trafficking increased during the reporting period. Beginning in May 2009, the government provided IOM office space within the Ministry of Labor as part of an overall effort to prevent unsafe migration, including human trafficking. Addressing concerns for migrants who depart Djiboutian shores illegally for Yemen, the government forged a partnership with IOM to erect billboards throughout the country warning migrants of the dangers of irregular migration, including the risk of becoming a victim of trafficking or labor exploitation. In 2009, the National Office for Refugees and Disaster Stricken People (ONARS) and UNHCR completed a census of refugees at the Ali Adde camp and issued identification cards to adults. These entities also jointly conducted twice-weekly screenings of asylum seekers at the Loyada border crossing before transporting eligible refugees to UNHCR's reception center. The government worked to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts by continuing to investigate child sexual exploitation cases and deploying a regular police vice squad. The government did not take any known measures to reduce the demand for forced labor.

The large population of undocumented or stateless persons of Haitian descent in the country is particularly vulnerable to trafficking. Women and children have been reportedly subjected to forced sex in the country and throughout the Caribbean, Europe, South America, and the United States. Women from other countries are also brought to the Dominican Republic for prostitution, and an unknown number may have subsequently become trafficking victims, even if they came voluntarily at first. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. History Trafficking routes of women, children and men The United Nations defines trafficking as \\"the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.\\" Men and women have been subjected to sex forced labor in the United States and Argentina. Most trafficked victims are sent to Western Europe, and some are sent to North America. Out of all areas in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic has the highest amount of trafficked persons; women are trafficked to Costa Rica and Panama as well as to Western Europe. There are over one thousand commercial sex workers from the island in Spain and 3,675 in Switzerland. While the Ministry of Labor reported that sugar plantations no longer use child labor, the sugar industry has been cited as vulnerable for possible use of forced labor. A 2009 NGO study found of some 500 male Haitian construction workers interviewed, 21 percent reported experiencing forced labor in the Dominican Republic at some point, although not in their current jobs as construction workers. However, the December 2014 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor reported 5 agricultural goods produced under such working conditions in the Dominican Republic, all of them involving child labor and one involving both child labor and forced labor. Street children and undocumented or stateless Haitian people ‚Äì including the Dominican-born children and grandchildren of Haitian migrants ‚Äì were vulnerable groups to trafficking. Child sex tourism is a problem, particularly in coastal resort areas, with child sex tourists arriving year- round from various countries. The Government of the Dominican Republic does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. The government has not convicted any trafficking offenders, including officials possibly complicit in trafficking, since 2007. Results in the areas of victim protection, and trafficking prevention were also limited. Why the Caribbean?  Unemployment, poverty, illiteracy, history of abuse, drug use, and gang membership are all individual causes of rising human trafficking within the Caribbean. Oftentimes, traffickers will work along the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic and trick fathers and mothers into letting their children leave, resulting in the exploitation of their children. There are external and global factors as well, some of which include the global demand for domestic servants, agricultural workers, and factory labor; political, social, or economic crises; natural disasters, the machismo attitude which causes men to discriminate against the female gender, public corruption, lack of government interest, and the limited economic opportunities. Most trafficked individuals often are never able to pay off their remittances which equates to about an estimated amount of 325 billion U.S. dollars; resulting in a lack of development to his or her said country. More specifically, in the Dominican Republic, 38% of the 784 Dominican and Haitian children questioned worked in the agricultural sector, as domestic workers in family homes and other informal activities such as street selling. Most children work six or seven days a week because they are required to take care of themselves. Two groups that are currently of specific concern are irregular migrants and deportees. Irregular migrants are those that move illegally across borders, those who enter a country legally but then stay beyond the limits of his or her visas, and people whose residency or citizenship status is modified because of changes in laws and regulations. Irregular migrants often enter into a vulnerable state where they suffer from both physical and emotional abuse. They do not want to leave the country and so suffer extortion and exploitation as a result. Many are promised that they will gain employment and then are sold by trafficking gangs. It is difficult to deduce the exact impact of trafficking or the number of women and children who have been affected because of circumstances such as violence, abuse, coercion, trauma and stigma associated with being a victim of trafficking. The language barrier can sometimes be a problem; especially when some words in the English language are not in the Spanish vocabulary. Another reason why it is difficult to obtain an exact number of people who are being trafficked is because there are no registers or indicators, no legal processes on the matter, and there are seldom complaints and reports of this type of offense. Legal and government responses Dominican law prohibits all forms of trafficking through its comprehensive anti-trafficking Law 137-03, which prescribes penalties of up to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment. The government reported 36 persons ‚Äúcurrently in preventive detention‚Äù under Law 137-03, but these data conflate trafficking and smuggling, as Law 137-03 covers both. Authorities reported the government may prosecute trafficking offenders under other statutes; NGO observers have said corruption on the part of authorities is a problem. The government reported it provided training for officials posted abroad on identifying and assisting trafficking victims, and each year, judges take an online course on trafficking, available through the National Magistrates School. The government has claimed to have made several efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims, but results were limited. The government has not clarified whether it has a formal mechanism to guide officials in proactively identifying victims among vulnerable groups and refer them to available services offered by NGOs. The government provided $13,500 in support for an NGO-run shelter and religious order that assisted adult, female victims. A government agency, which is reportedly underfunded, managed shelters for children that assisted child trafficking victims during the reporting period. While the government did not provide formal long-term reintegration assistance programs for trafficking victims, the First Lady‚Äôs office facilitated victims‚Äô access to psychological and financial support, and another government agency offered skills training to some victims during the reporting period. The Dominican government claimed to have encouraged victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, but few elected to do so. Another NGO reported an instance where several victims were willing to assist with a prosecution but claimed there had been no progress in four years. Some officials and an NGO reported some alleged trafficking offenders made deals to compensate victims in lieu of criminal prosecution. The government did not implement a national public awareness campaign during the reporting period, though there were several campaigns on raising anti-trafficking awareness targeted toward at-risk populations and tourist areas. A national interagency anti-trafficking commission chaired by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitated inter-agency cooperation and oversaw implementation of a national action plan, which remained reliant on donor funding but was hampered by lack of participation of the prosecution service. The government did not undertake efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period. Since 2001, the U.S. government has given over four hundred million dollars in foreign assistance to help combat and eliminate human trafficking and the U.S. government has funded 42 task forces on human trafficking between 2004 and 2006. However, on July 16, 2012, the Dominican Republic signed three agreements dealing with human trafficking within the United States. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act was enacted by the United States in 2000 and was created to establish minimum standards to combat human trafficking applicable to countries that have significant trafficking problems. The Secretary of State was to provide reports each year about countries that do not follow the minimum standards for eliminating trafficking. Each country is part of a Tier group; 1-3 with 3 being the worst. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 was created much like the VTVPA however it also addressed the top countries to be keeping a close eye on. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008 gave more freedom to monitor and evaluate all assistance given under the previous laws. Other countries were also required to undergo inspections in critical areas where trafficking is most likely. Lastly, there also need to be better indicators for human trafficking. Data needs to describe the international population movements and provide governments with a solid basis for policy formulation and implementation. One of the greatest needs is to provide technical and financial assistance to developing countries in order to enable them to collect better migration data. Results of human trafficking in the Caribbean There are many economic, societal, health, and other impacts on human trafficking. =Economic impacts= Trafficking results in a transfer of money to developing countries because the trafficked individuals have to pay off the debt that he or she has for being trafficked. =Societal impacts= Trafficking reduces extended family ties and the forced absence of females leads to a breakdown of families and neglect of children and the elderly members of the family. The victims of trafficking are often ignored and shunned once he or she returns to the community and then this individual gets involved with criminal activity. Children who are trafficked are seen as forever damaged and these children suffer from trauma and psychological problems. =Health impacts= Transporting individuals can result in injury and for some even death before he or she reaches their intended destination. Certain diseases can be a result because the transportation devices are overcrowded and unsanitary. Many individuals who are trafficked for the sex industry may also develop HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases; many times the victims are not given the option to use condoms. =Miscellaneous impacts= Women and children are the main vulnerable groups of exploitation. These people who are trafficked no longer have human rights; these people lose the right and opportunity to grow up in a protected environment. These people also lose the right to healthcare, education, work, and other freedoms. Many governments are unable to protect women and children who are kidnapped and many government officials are bribed by the traffickers and therefore cannot combat against the rugs human trafficking.

Prosecution Ecuador prohibits all forms of human trafficking in Article 190 of its penal code, amended in 2005; trafficking for the purpose of labor exploitation carries a punishment of six to nine years' imprisonment, and trafficking for sexual exploitation carries a penalty of eight to 12 years' imprisonment. Penalties for human trafficking may be increased, by aggravating circumstances, to a maximum of 35 years' imprisonment. Such penalties are commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Other statutes, such as Article 528.13, which prohibits the commercial sexual exploitation of children, are also used to prosecute human trafficking crimes. Despite reports of trafficking-related corruption, particularly related to civil registry officials issuing false identity documents to children, no investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of potentially complicit officials took place last year. According to Ecuadorian police, brothel owners commonly use false identity documents to exploit children in prostitution, and to avoid criminal liability for immigration and trafficking violations in the event of a police raid. Most cases of human trafficking investigated in Ecuador during 2009 involved forced prostitution, particularly of children. A growing number of investigations are related to labor exploitation of children and adults, but do not appear commensurate with the incidence of forced labor in the country, particularly the large number of children exploited for forced begging and forced domestic work. The government has provided police specializing in crimes against children with specific training on trafficking in persons. Ecuadorian authorities have formed partnerships with Colombian, Venezuelan, U.S., and Chinese officials to jointly investigate several trafficking cases. Protection The Ecuadorian government has ensured trafficking victims' access to legal, medical, psychological, and shelter services, in large part through its partnership with a network of NGOs that received funding from the government and international organizations. Women and girls are eligible for shelter services, while the government provides boys and men with victim services on an ad hoc basis, though shelters for trafficking victims remain lacking in parts of the country. Foreign victims are eligible for the same services as Ecuadorian trafficking victims. In addition to these short-term services, the government provides victims with counseling, protection, job training, and educational training, and ensures that child victims received long-term care as needed. Through its Victim and Witness Protection Program, the Ecuadorian government operates specialized police units in the cities of Guayaquil, Machala, Portoviejo, Cuenca, and Quito. These units accompany other police authorities on brothel raids to coordinate immediate protective services toward identified trafficking victims, and assistance for victim witnesses during court proceedings. The government encourages victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders. While Ecuadorian authorities have conducted raids on establishments to rescue children in prostitution, according to the U.S. government they did not demonstrate adequate efforts to identify adult trafficking victims among women exploited in brothels and other vulnerable populations. In 2009, police removed 33 children from commercial sexual exploitation and five from conditions of forced labor. Authorities did not penalize identified trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. The Ecuadorian government does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution, though foreign victims are not typically deported from the country. The government provides victim services to repatriated Ecuadorian trafficking victims. Ecuadorian authorities have developed trafficking in persons protocols for consular officers abroad and have begun training their diplomatic corps in these procedures. Prevention The Ecuadorian government has undertaken vigorous public awareness campaigns against child forced labor and prostitution. The government has forged partnerships with private telecommunications companies and a bank to combat child labor, in part through a network of schools for former child laborers. During December 2009, the government launched a national campaign against child begging and a radio soap opera series about the dangers of forced labor, which was broadcast on provincial radio stations in Spanish and Kichwa, a local language. State-owned radio stations have also donated airtime to an NGO in the highlands to broadcast messages on how to identify and avoid human trafficking situations. The Ecuadorian Ministry of Tourism has launched a nationwide campaign to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of children in the tourism industry, and the government has continued a multimedia campaign in 20 departments to encourage citizens to identify and report trafficking cases.

U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017 meaning that its government does not fully meet the minimum standards described in the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), but is making significant efforts toward meeting those standards.Trafficking in Persons Report, pp. 39, 162 (U.S. State Department, June 2016). Background Some of Egypt's estimated two hundred thousand to one million street children ‚Äì both boys and girls ‚Äì are exploited in prostitution and forced begging. Local gangs are, at times, involved in this exploitation. Egyptian children are recruited for domestic and agricultural labor; some of these children face conditions indicative of involuntary servitude, such as restrictions on movement, non- payment of wages, threats, and physical or sexual abuse. In addition, wealthy men from Persian Gulf region reportedly travel to Egypt to purchase \\"temporary\\" or \\"summer marriages\\" with Egyptian females, including girls who are under the age of 18. These arrangements are often facilitated by the females' parents and marriage brokers and are a form of commercial sexual exploitation of children. Child sex tourism occurs in Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor. Egypt is a transit country for women trafficked from Uzbekistan, Moldova, Ukraine, Russia, and other Eastern European countries to Israel for commercial sexual exploitation. Organized crime groups are involved in these movements. Men and women from South and Southeast Asia may be subjected to forced labor in Egypt. Ethiopians, Eritreans, Sudanese, Indonesians, Filipino, and possible Sri Lankan females migrate willingly to Egypt but may be subjected to forced domestic work. Some conditions they face include no time off, sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, withholding of wages, and restrictions of movement. Employers may use the domestic workers' illegal status and lack of employment contracts as a coercive tool. Some of the immigrants and refugees who engage in prostitution may have been coerced to do so. Young female Sudanese refugees, including those under 18, may be coerced into prostitution in Cairo's nightclubs by family or Sudanese gang members. NGO and media reports indicate some Egyptians are forced to work in Jordan and experience the withholding of passports, forced overtime, non-payment of wages, and restrictions of movement. In 2010, the Egyptian government approved new legislation criminalizing trafficking in persons for labor and sexual exploitation. In 2009/2010, the government made its first two convictions under the 2008 anti-trafficking amendments to the Child Law and raised awareness on \\"summer marriages\\", which are often used to facilitate commercial sexual exploitation. According to the U.S. government, the Egyptian government's lack of formal victim identification procedures and protection services allowed unidentified victims of trafficking to be punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.\\"Egypt\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). Seasonal or temporary marriage There is a phenomenon in Egypt known as 'seasonal' or 'temporary' marriages. This is when young women and girls particularly from poor families are married off to men from Arab states of the Persian Gulf to provide sexual services to non-Egyptian men. Pursuant to a survey that was conducted by the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM), 67% of 2,000 of families selected from a sample in Al Hawamdia, Al Badrashein and Abu Almonros were personally aware of child marriages. The survey also showed that the purpose of these marriages is mainly economic.Ezeilo , J. N. (2011, April 15). \\"Report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, espeically women and children\\" In some instances Egyptian girls may return to the husbands home country and work as a maid. The girls that stay in Egypt often become shunned from society and struggle to remarry the orthodox way especially in cases where the women has given birth to a child with the husband. Egypt: Law No. 103 of 1976 also known as the new tourism marriage law was enacted to deter and protect young girls from seasonal/temporary marriage. The law requires documentation of marriage contracts, requiring a foreign man to present a certificate from his country's embassy stating that there are no impediments to the effecting marriage, a deposit is also made in the girl's name, as security for her when the women is 25 years or more younger than him. The minimum age for marriage was also raised to 18. The special rapporteur Joy Ngozi Ezeilo states that in practice, this law is largely ineffective as an arbitrary number of seasonal/temporary marriages between Egyptian women and non-Egyptian men continue to take place. Institutional framework The National Coordinating Committee directs all anti-trafficking efforts at the national level. The National Coordinating Committee is directed by the Advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and is made up of relevant representatives of ministries, such as the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Manpower and Migration, the Ministry of Social Solidarity and the Ministry of Tourism. The committee drafts legislation and a plan on fighting trafficking persons in Egypt, by combatting illegal migrants groups and identifying human trafficking activities. There has also been legislation enacted to combat human trafficking and protect those illegal migrants by diminishing their suffering. The National Council of Women (NCW), was established in 2000 to monitor accomplishments and to strengthen women's role in society. In 2007 the Prime Minister launched a coordinating committee to combat trafficking in humans, namely women and children. This committee aims to review legislation and policies implemented to prevent trafficking.Arab Republic of Egypt The National Council for Women (pp. 1-69 at 7, Rep.). (n.d.). The National Council of Women NCW also Implemented the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW) This is a specialist unit which fights against trafficking and carries out follow up studies and reports on trafficking of girls and women. In April 2009, NCW issued a report on violence against women in Egypt, which recognized \\"seasonal\\" or \\"temporary\\" marriage as a possible form of human trafficking and suggested that decision makers determine whether it should be considered as human trafficking. In 2016 the Government implemented a 2016‚Äì2021 plan to fight and prevent trafficking. This was approved by the prime minister however there were little means and resources allocated towards its implementation. In 2016 the national anti trafficking committee and the national committee merged aiming to prevent illegal migration, the government also launched 90 anti-trafficking campaigns.Trafficking in persons Report (U.S State Department, 2017) In June 2016, the government ran conferences about migration, smuggling, and human trafficking issues affecting Africa and Europe. Surprise inspections were carried out by the Ministry of Manpower particularly at work sites for foreign workers, though the ministry did not report potential trafficking victims. Prosecution Egypt's parliament has passed legislation criminalizing all forms of human trafficking and prescribing penalties from three to 15 years' imprisonment ‚Äì and up to life imprisonment if aggravating circumstances are present ‚Äì with fines ranging from $9,000 to $36,000 for offenses. Amendments to the Child Law (No. 126 of 2008) include provisions prohibiting the trafficking of children for commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. These amendments prescribe sentences of at least five years' imprisonment. Protection According to the U.S. government, Egyptian officials did not employ formal procedures to identify victims of trafficking and refer them to providers of care; as a result, trafficking victims, including many street children and women arrested for prostitution, were often treated as criminals rather than victims. Some children may be sent to juvenile detention centers, which are in bad condition. Others may be subject to incarceration with adults, despite the Child Law which prohibits this practice. Border security personnel in the Sinai continued efforts to interdict undocumented imagrints, occasionally killing some of them, while showing no evidence of efforts to identify possible trafficking victims among this vulnerable population. As of 2009, the Ministry of Social Solidarity operated 19 drop-in centers for street children, women, and the disabled that may have provided care to trafficking victims. The NCCM operates a 24-hour hotline to respond to complaints of child abuse. Specialized care for adults or foreign victims was not provided as of 2009. In prisons or detention centers, law enforcement officers may have further mistreated these victims through verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Foreign victims are not offered legal alternatives to removal to countries in which they may face hardship or retribution. The government does not actively encourage victims to assist in investigations against their traffickers. Prevention The government made progress in preventing \\"summer marriages\\" in the reporting period, but did not otherwise undertake efforts to prevent human trafficking. The government was mandated by the newly passed law to create an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate anti-trafficking enforcement activities, victim protection, and programs. The government did not institute any other public campaigns to raise awareness on trafficking, including any on involuntary domestic servitude. The government made no efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or to raise awareness of sex tourism. The government has a well-developed birth registration and national identity card system. There were no reports of Egyptian government's efforts to provide anti-trafficking training for its troops before deploying them to international peacekeeping missions.

Most victims are Salvadoran women and girls from rural areas who are forced into commercial sexual exploitation in urban areas, though some adults and children are subjected to forced labor as agricultural workers and domestic workers. The majority of foreign victims are women and children from neighboring countries, such as Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic, who migrate to El Salvador in response to job offers, but are subsequently forced into prostitution or domestic servitude. Trafficking offenders use fraudulent documentation to facilitate the movement of foreign victims. Salvadorans have been subjected to forced prostitution in Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, the United States, Spain, and Italy. The Government of El Salvador does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the reporting period, the government sustained anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts and continued to provide services to children who were trafficked for sexual exploitation. It did not vigorously investigate or prosecute incidents of forced labor, and it did not take adequate measures to ensure that adult trafficking victims received access to necessary services.\\"El Salvador\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Sex trafficking Citizen and foreign women and girls have been victims of sex trafficking in El Salvador. They raped and physically and psychologically harmed in locations throughout the country. Prosecution Article 367B of the Salvadoran Penal Code prohibits all forms of human trafficking, and prescribes penalties of four to eight years‚Äô imprisonment. Sentences may be increased by one-third when the offense is accompanied by aggravated circumstances, such as when the offense is committed against a child or the defendant is a public official. Such penalties are sufficiently stringent, but are not commensurate with penalties prescribed for serious offenses such as rape, which carries a punishment of six to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment. Since passage of El Salvador‚Äôs anti-trafficking statute in 2004, some prosecutors prefer to charge trafficking-related crimes under the country‚Äôs rape statute to secure heavier mandatory sentences against offenders. In 2009, the government‚Äôs dedicated anti-trafficking police and prosecutor units investigated 70 cases of human trafficking, prosecuted seven cases, and obtained seven convictions with imposed sentences ranging from 4 to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment. While the government secured a number of convictions equal to the previous year, they prosecuted fewer cases than in 2008, when prosecutors brought charges in 15 cases of human trafficking. The majority of law enforcement efforts focused on sex trafficking. The government sustained partnerships with neighbouring foreign governments in pursuing joint anti- trafficking investigations. During the reporting period, the government investigated three public officials for trafficking-related offences, including the former anti-trafficking coordinator in the Attorney General‚Äôs Office; charges have not yet been filed. In conjunction with an NGO, government officials drafted and distributed guidelines for criminal judges and prosecutors on procedures for human trafficking cases. In 2017, authorities investigated 73 sex trafficking cases, two forced labor cases, and one domestic servitude case, in comparison to 55 sex trafficking cases in 2016. Offenders convicted in 2017 received sentences ranging from 10 to 14 years imprisonment. Protection The Salvadoran government sustained modest victim assistance last year. Immigration officials screened for possible trafficking victims in border regions, notifying the police and referring victims to care facilities; in general, however, the Salvadoran government did not proactively identify trafficking victims among other vulnerable populations, such as women in prostitution or child laborers. The government maintained a shelter dedicated to underage girls who had been victims of sex trafficking; this shelter offered victims psychological and medical care. Most government assistance and services were directed at child trafficking victims, and were not readily accessible to adult or male trafficking victims. However, the government operated a women‚Äôs shelter serving at least one victim of human trafficking and provided some adult victims with legal and medical services. Adult trafficking victims were also referred to a government-run shelter for undocumented aliens. Further services were provided by NGOs and international organizations. Authorities identified 51 victims of human trafficking in 2009; all but three of these victims were girls, and all but one victim was subjected to forced prostitution. The government trained personnel, including consular officers, in identifying Salvadoran trafficking victims abroad; consular officials identified 21 such trafficking victims during the reporting period. Domestically, Salvadoran authorities encouraged identified victims to assist with law enforcement efforts; 55 victims participated in investigations or prosecutions of their traffickers during the reporting period, though others chose not to assist law enforcement efforts due to social stigma or fear of reprisals from their traffickers. Victims generally were not charged, jailed, or penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked; however, not all government officials recognized cases of forced labor or forced prostitution as human trafficking. Law enforcement and social service officials may request residency status for a victim on a case-by-case basis, though they reported no trafficking victims requested this status over the last year. Prevention The Salvadoran government sustained anti- trafficking prevention efforts during the reporting period. The government forged or continued partnerships with NGOs, international organizations, and foreign governments on anti-trafficking initiatives. In May 2009, the government collaborated with an NGO to launch a campaign aimed specifically at increasing awareness of the commercial sexual exploitation of children; the campaign reached approximately 4,500 children and adults. The government included anti-trafficking information in the training it gives to military forces prior to their deployment for international peacekeeping missions. No specific government efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor were reported over the last year.

Children are believed to be recruited and transported from nearby countries, primarily Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, and Gabon, and forced to work in domestic servitude, market labor, ambulant vending, and other forms of forced labor, such as carrying water and washing laundry. Most victims are believed to be exploited in Malabo and Bata, where a burgeoning oil industry creates demand for labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Women may also have been recruited and transported to Equatorial Guinea from Cameroon, Benin, other neighboring countries, and from China for forced labor or forced prostitution. In October 2009, the vessel Sharon was detained in Gabon with 285 immigrants aboard, including 34 children identified as trafficking victims destined for Equatorial Guinea. Reports that women of Equatoguinean extraction were trafficked to Iceland for commercial sexual exploitation during the last reporting period have not reappeared. The Government of Equatorial Guinea does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, such as anti-trafficking training for law enforcement personnel, the government did not prosecute any trafficking offenses during the reporting period. It routinely deported trafficking victims without recognizing their victim status or referring them to assistance services. It continued to provide anti-trafficking training to law enforcement officials, and police monitoring of possible child labor exploitation in open air markets, though for another consecutive year, this training failed to lead to tangible anti-trafficking actions.\\"Equatorial Guinea\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Equatorial Guinea demonstrated minimal law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking during the reporting period; the few measures taken were incidental to efforts to tighten border security and to control more closely immigration, emigration, and the issuance of work and travel permits to foreign migrants. Equatorial Guinea prohibits all forms of trafficking through its 2004 Law on the Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Persons, which prescribes penalties of 10 to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment, punishments which are sufficiently stringent. To date, no human trafficking cases were prosecuted under the relevant portion of this law. The government demonstrated no evidence of its forging partnerships with other governments in the region to investigate and prosecute trafficking cases. There was no evidence, however, of government officials‚Äô involvement in or tolerance of trafficking. Under a government-funded contract with a foreign security training company, instructors conducted courses to improve the awareness of military and police officials on human trafficking issues. Two government officials ‚Äì one from the Ministry of Defense and a sitting Supreme Court justice ‚Äì assisted in the training. In December 2009, the government signed a new five-year contract with the foreign company that will address maritime security and include instruction on human rights and human trafficking issues. Protection The Government of Equatorial Guinea demonstrated no effective measures to protect trafficking victims during the reporting period. The government has no law to provide benefits or services to victims and witnesses; and it did not provide funding or support to any victim care facilities, though provision of such services are called for in the government‚Äôs National Plan Against Human Trafficking. Law enforcement authorities did not employ procedures to identify victims of trafficking among foreign women and children in prostitution or foreign children in exploitative labor conditions. The government also did not make efforts ‚Äì in either a systematic or ad hoc way ‚Äì to refer victims to organizations that provide short- or long-term care. The provision of care for child trafficking victims was the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Catholic Church. In practice, only Equatoguinean children were placed in a church or NGO-run orphanage for care; foreign children were usually deported summarily. The government did not provide foreign trafficking victims with access to legal, medical, or psychological services, and the government made little effort to assist them with temporary or permanent resident status, or any other relief from deportation. The government did not keep records on the total number of trafficking victims identified during this reporting period. The government continued to provide specialized training for law enforcement and immigration officials on identifying and assisting victims of trafficking during the reporting period, and these trained officials were issued wallet- sized instruction cards showing the steps to take when a trafficking situation or victim is identified. Social workers received no such training. The government deported foreign trafficking victims without care or assistance after a brief detention, and seldom notified the victims‚Äô embassies. Officials did not appear to fine victims, but frequently confiscated their possessions and money. No victims were penalized for unlawful acts committed as a directed result of being trafficked during the reporting period. The government gave little to no assistance ‚Äì such as medical aid, shelter, or financial help ‚Äì to its nationals who were repatriated as victims of trafficking. Prevention The government of Equatorial Guinea undertook limited trafficking prevention efforts during the year. In partnership with UNICEF and a foreign contractor, the government provided anti-trafficking information and educational campaigns during the reporting period ‚Äì principally nationally broadcast radio and television spots to familiarize the general population with human trafficking. The Prime Minister‚Äôs Office directed activities of the Interagency Commission for Trafficking in Persons, which is chaired by the Ministry of Justice. The Commission also includes the Attorney General, and the Ministries of Health, Interior, National Security, and Women‚Äôs Affairs. It is not clear how often the committee met during the year. The government did not undertake any discernible measures to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts during the year.

Trafficking in Persons Report > 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). In late 2013, the BBC reported the results of a study by activist Ms. Meron Estefanos and Dutch educators from Tilburg University. Among its conclusions: up to 30,000 Eritreans have been abducted since 2007--mostly refugees fleeing the country--and taken to Egypt's Sinai. At least $600m (¬£366m) in ransom payments has been extorted. Nesru Jamal of ERTA said that the report, entitled \\"The Human Trafficking Cycle: Sinai and Beyond\\" was presented to EU home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr√∂m in the European Parliament on Dec. 4, 2013. Jamal says the report accuses Eritrea's Border Surveillance Unit (commanded by General Tekle Kiflay) of being central to the trafficking. For years many abductions, blamed on Rashayida Bedouin, happened along the Sudan border. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel estimates that, between 2008 and 2012, as many as 4,000 refugees died. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 3\\" in 2017. Background The human rights record of Eritrea is considered poor.Eritrea Human Rights Overview Human Rights Watch Since Eritrea's conflict with Ethiopia in 1998‚Äì2001, Eritrea's human rights record has worsened. Several human rights violations are committed by the government or on behalf of the government. Freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association are limited. Those that practise \\"unregistered\\" religions, try to flee the nation, or escape military duty are arrested and put into prison. Domestic and international human rights organizations are not allowed to function in Eritrea. In 2009 Human Rights Watch said that the government was turning the country into a 'giant prison'. All denominations of Christianity enjoyed freedom of worship until 2002 when the government outlawed worship and assembly outside the 'registered' denominations. All groups who worship secretly in a house or any other unregistered place of assembly are arrested and imprisoned without charge or trial. Religious prisoners are often tortured in Eritrea.CSW-USA on Eritrea CSW Freedom of worship is one of the top reasons thousands of Eritreans flee the country. There are thousands of Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia and Sudan seeking asylum in Europe or another region of the West. Eritrea is a one-party state in which national legislative elections have been repeatedly postponed.Eritrea. Grassroots International Prosecution U.S. Department of State, 2010: > Article 605 of the Eritrean Transitional Criminal Code prohibits trafficking > in women and young persons for sexual exploitation, which is punishable by > up to five years' imprisonment, or from three to 10 years' imprisonment if > aggravating circumstances are present; these penalties are not commensurate > with punishments prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article > 565 prohibits enslavement and prescribes punishment of five to 20 years' > imprisonment, penalties which are sufficiently stringent. Forced labor and > slavery are prohibited, except where authorized by law under Article 16 of > the ratified, but suspended, Eritrean Constitution. Proclamation 11/199 > prohibits the recruitment of children under 18 years of age into the armed > forces. Nevertheless, the government has never used these statutes to > prosecute cases of human trafficking. Protection U.S. Department of State, 2010: > The government did not appear to provide any significant assistance to > victims of trafficking during the reporting period.

Mauritius is the main provider of foreign direct investment (FDI) to India and also the preferred jurisdiction for Indian outward investments into Africa. In fact 39.6% of FDI to India came from Mauritius between 2001 and 2011. Business organisations of Mauritius investing in India Nine of the 10 largest foreign business organizations or companies investing in India (from April 2000‚ÄìJanuary 2011) are based in Mauritius.

Financial services sector Since the inception of its financial services sector, Mauritius has taken all appropriate steps to safeguard the credibility of its jurisdiction. Mauritius has a stringent legal and regulatory framework recognized by the International Monetary Fund, Financial Stability Board and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to combat money laundering. Furthermore, Mauritius appears on the OECD White List of Jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standards. A recent peer review of Mauritius by the OECD Global Forum, further upholds that Mauritius has all the essential elements in place for an effective exchange of accounting, banking, and ownership/identity information with other countries. Mauritius is also compliant with norms prescribed by International Organization of Securities Commissions, Iowa Interstate Railroad, Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and the Basel Committee and has enacted necessary legislation. In this regard, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal and Related Matters Act and the Financial Intelligence and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2002 which provides a framework for exchange of information on money laundering with members of international financial intelligence groups are cases in point. The Asset Recovery Act was promulgated to enlarges the scope for freezing ill-gotten assets. Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) India has comprehensive Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) with 88 countries. This means that there are agreed rates of tax and jurisdiction on specified types of income arising in a country to a tax resident of another country. Under the Income Tax Act 1961 of India, there are two provisions, Section 90 and Section 91, which provide specific relief to taxpayers to save them from double taxation. Section 90 is for taxpayers who have paid the tax to a country with which India has signed DTAA, while Section 91 provides relief to tax payers who have paid tax to a country with which India has not signed a DTAA. Thus, India gives relief to both kind of taxpayers. According to the tax treaty between India and Mauritius, capital gains can only be taxed in Mauritius, the same treaty exist with 16 other countries. Thanks to its low 3% capital gains tax, quality regulatory framework, professional labor, geographical proximity, cultural affinities, and historical ties with India, Mauritius is the most attractive conduit for investments into India. The DTAC has helped Mauritius in developing its financial services industry while India has benefitted through FDI and job creation.  Indian press  =Suspicion= According to various Indian press, the DTAA are being misused by investors to avoid paying taxes by routing investments through various countries which has tax treaty with India, in particular Mauritius and Singapore, which account for 48% of FDI inflow to India.

For this purpose it is generally only used when the pH is less than 7.1 and when the underlying cause is either diarrhea, vomiting, or the kidneys. Other uses include high blood potassium, tricyclic antidepressant overdose, and cocaine toxicity as well as a number of other poisonings. It is given by injection into a vein. Side effects may include low blood potassium, high blood sodium, and swelling. It is not recommended in people with low blood calcium. Sodium bicarbonate is in the alkalinizing family of medication. It works by increasing blood bicarbonate, which buffers excess hydrogen ion and raises blood pH. Commercial production of sodium bicarbonate began between 1791 and 1823. Intravenous medical use began around the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Sodium bicarbonate is available as a generic medication. Medical uses Intravenous sodium bicarbonate is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis, such as can occur in severe kidney disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, circulatory insufficiency, extracorporeal circulation of blood, in hemolysis requiring alkalinization of the urine to avoid nephrotoxicity of blood pigments, and certain drug intoxications, such as by barbiturate overdose, salicylate poisoning, tricyclic antidepressant overdose or methanol poisoning. In addition, sodium bicarbonate is indicated in severe diarrhea, where large amounts of bicarbonate may be lost. However, overall treatment should also strive to treat the underlying cause of the acidosis, such as giving insulin in case of diabetic ketoacidosis. = Dhaka fluid = Dhaka fluid is one of the IV fluids used in intravenous rehydration therapy which has sodium bicarbonate content in it. Used as a resuscitative fluid in burn management. Contraindications Intravenous sodium bicarbonate is contraindicated in patients who are losing chloride, such as by vomiting. Because of its sodium content, intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure and severe chronic kidney disease, where low sodium intake is strongly indicated to prevent sodium retention. By similar rationale, intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be given with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids. Side effects Extravasation of intravenous sodium bicarbonate has been reported to cause chemical cellulitis because of its alkalinity, resulting in tissue necrosis, ulceration and/or sloughing at the site of infiltration. This condition is managed by prompt elevation of the part, warmth and local injection of lidocaine or hyaluronidase. Interactions Norepinephrine and dobutamine cannot be used as additives in an intravenous sodium bicarbonate solution. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate should not be mixed with calcium, as they may precipitate, except where compatibility has been previously established for the preparations at hand. Overdosing Overdose of intravenous sodium bicarbonate results in solute and/or fluid overload, potentially leading to edema, including pulmonary edema. Also, it can cause metabolic alkalosis (with signs including muscular twitchings, irritability and tetany). Hypernatremia is also possible. Repeated fractional doses and frequent monitoring by laboratory tests are recommended to minimize the possibility of overdosing. Rapid administration (equal to or exceeding 10 mL/min) of intravenous sodium bicarbonate into neonates and children under two years of age may produce hypernatremia, resulting in a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure and, possibly, intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, the rate of administration to such patients should not exceed 8 mEq/kg/day, unless a very strong indication is present. Composition It is administered as a hypertonic solution of sodium bicarbonate, most commonly in concentrations of 4.2%, 5.0%, 7.5% or 8.4%.Sodium Bicarbonate, Dosage Form: injection, solution from Drugs.com. Revised: 03/2011 by General Injectables & Vaccines, Inc. The solutions generally contain no antimicrobial agent or other added buffer. Mechanism of action After injection, intravenous sodium bicarbonate dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3‚àí) anions. Bicarbonate anions can consume hydrogen ions (H+) and thereby be converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3), which can subsequently be converted to water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) which can be excreted by the lungs. Society and culture The Italian physician Tullio Simoncini has claimed that intravenous sodium bicarbonate is an effective cancer therapy. This is rejected by mainstream medicine. Simoncini has been imprisoned twice for culpable manslaughter of people affected by cancer.

The parish has been served by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate since 1851.Holy Angels Parish, The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate in Buffalo, NY. History At the request of Bishop John Timon, who had recently organized the Diocese of Buffalo, missionaries from the Oblates of Mary Immaculate arrived in 1851 to establish a seminary and college at the site of today's St. Joseph Cathedral rectory on Franklin Street. It quickly became clear a larger facility was needed. The site of the present-day Holy Angels Church was purchased in 1852, where two abandoned buildings (formerly the county poorhouse and insane asylum) were converted into a college and chapel. In 1856, construction began on a permanent house of worship, which was dedicated by Bishop Timon in 1859, although it was incomplete. In 1874 work was started on the transept, sanctuary and choir, completing the building's modern appearance a year later. Renovations to the interior in 1898 added marble side altars, a marble mosaic floor in the sanctuary, and hand-carved Stations of the Cross. Further, two Tiffany stained glass windows were installed by the main altar. These windows were displayed at the Pan-American Exposition in 1901.Holy Angels Church, Historic Markers, Monuments and Memorials of Buffalo, New York. Between 1959 and 1962, the church enjoyed its largest membership, with over 2,400 families registered. This was followed by a decline in membership as families moved to the suburbs. In 1986, the church was extensively restored, and rededicated in 1987.

It aired on Comedy Central in the United States on August 18, 2011. A pivotal episode, it reveals Dr. Zoidberg's backstory. This episode was nominated for the 2012 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour).  Plot  Frustrated with Zoidberg's incompetence as a doctor, the Planet Express crew demand Professor Farnsworth fire him. The Professor refuses, and the crew question why Zoidberg was ever employed in the first place. A series of flashbacks reveal that Zoidberg first met and befriended Farnsworth in 2927, during a mission to kill a Tritonian yeti for Mom. During the mission, Zoidberg is attacked by a yeti, but is saved by Farnsworth, who is scratched by the yeti. Farnsworth now fears that he has contracted hyper-malaria, a painful, fatal, incurable disease which can either strike instantly or remain dormant for years. He asks Zoidberg to perform a mercy killing if he ever exhibits symptoms of the disease. Grateful for the Professor having saved his life and killing the yeti, Zoidberg agrees. As a result, Zoidberg is employed by the Professor for the purpose of carrying out the task. In the present, the Professor begins to experience what he believes are the symptoms of hyper- malaria, and informs Zoidberg that the time has come to fulfill his promise, but insists that Zoidberg must kill him by surprise because he is afraid to die. The crew, not aware of the agreement, are shocked when they walk in on Zoidberg attempting to murder the Professor, and restrain him with the Professor's lab coat and imprison him. Zoidberg notices a single white hair on the Professor's coat and deduces that he does not have hyper-malaria, but rather yetiism, which he had contracted after having been scratched by the Tritonian yeti. The disease mimics the symptoms of hyper-malaria, but instead of illness or death, its victim transforms into a yeti. Zoidberg escapes and goes to Mom (whom he knows informally as \\"Carol\\") to acquire the yeti's head so that he may use its pineal gland as an antidote. Mom, who has great respect and admiration for Zoidberg, says that he is \\"the best in the business\\" when it comes to alien anatomy and asks him why he stayed with the Professor all these years instead of opening his own research lab and becoming very wealthy. He replies that the Professor is his friend, indicating that he is poor because he values others more than money. Zoidberg is unable to pay for the yeti head, but Mom accepts payment with the only thing he has ‚Äì a coupon for a free tanning session. Meanwhile, the Professor reveals the truth to the crew about his arrangement with Zoidberg. Feeling guilty for their previous treatment of Zoidberg they agree to kill the Professor themselves, using an elaborate, Rube Goldberg style killing machine. Soon after starting the machine Zoidberg returns to announce his discovery to the crew just as the Professor begins transforming into a yeti. Zoidberg forces him to swallow the yeti gland, successfully curing him. As the crew goes to a tanning salon to celebrate, Zoidberg laments giving away his coupon. A grateful Farnsworth goes back and offers to treat Zoidberg to a free session, and they both depart as friends.

It aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 23, 2011. Plot Planet Express faces foreclosure and to raise money, Professor Farnsworth, Fry, Bender, Zoidberg, Hermes and Scruffy take advantage of a contract clause to force Leela, Amy, and LaBarbara to pose for a pin-up calendar. This plan does not work out, so the company converts into a private airline. During its maiden voyage the plane runs out of fuel and crashes on a planet made entirely of minerals with rivers of mercury. Tensions begin to arise between the males and females, and each gender forms a group. A sentient rock alien appears and is fascinated by everyone's genders, as it is unfamiliar with the concept. The alien tests the two groups on gender superiority, challenging them to reach a glacier cave before the planet reaches perihelion, boiling the mercury. Both groups realize they can create a cooler from Bender's gas compressor, and the freon coil of a refrigerator fembot named Amana. Hermes and LaBarbara each steal a part from the other group, but are caught by each other. During an argument they end up having sex, and fail to create a cooler in time. The rock alien teleports everyone to the safety of the cave, and expresses its disappointment that both groups failed to cooperate with each other. In an attempt to resolve their differences, the alien uses its powers to neuter everyone. Without the tension caused by genders, the castaways get along and work together to repair the crashed ship. However, Hermes and LaBarbara begin to miss the feeling of physical intimacy and demand the alien to restore their genders. The alien attempts to do so, but inadvertently switches their genders. Before the alien can fix its mistake, it is vaporized by Zapp Brannigan. Back at Planet Express, Leela and Amy take advantage of the contract clause to force the men- turned-women to pose for the calendar, and enough calendars are sold to save the business. Their celebrations are interrupted by the rock alien's friend, the Borax Kid, who restores everyone to their correct genders before leaving. Scruffy emerges from a bathroom, still female, having missed the Borax Kid's visit. Production In earlier drafts of the script, the episode did not feature the characters switching to their opposite genders at all, nor the character of the Borax Kid. An original ending involved Amy's parents, Leo and Inez Wong, purchasing Planet Express and saving it from foreclosure.

The station was along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway's main line and served trains such as the Super Chief and El Captain. After Amtrak took over intercity rail in the United States, it was served by trains such as the Lone Star (1971‚Äì1979) and the Southwest Chief (1971‚Äì1996). Although train service ended in 1996 and it has been demolished since, the site is still used if derailments cause trains to use the Chillicothe Subdivision instead of the Mendota Subdivision. History =Background= The first railroad to arrive in Galesburg was the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in December 1854.Wilson 1999, p. 5City of Galesburg 2007, p. 8 The railroad served passengers at a large depot at South and Seminary streets. Galesburg was also a major junction for the CB&Q;, since it was the point where many branch lines crossed the Chicago‚ÄîDenver main line.Wilson 1999, p. 7Wilson 1999, p. 49City of Galesburg 2007, p. 7 Also in Galesburg was the railroad's roundhouse and hump yard,Robison 2000, p. 66 the latter still used with BNSF. =Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe= The Santa Fe Railway was originally planned to bypass Galesburg 10 to 12 miles to the southeast.Robison 2000, p. 72 The railway was trying to build on the straightest line possible between Kansas City and Chicago‚ÄîGalesburg was not on this line.Marshall 1945, p 202 Led by Clark E. Carr, the townspeople tried to persuade the railway to build through Galesburg. A guaranty‚Äîsigned by many citizens of Galesburg‚Äîwas telegraphed to the Santa Fe's headquarters in Boston.Perry 1912, p. 613 It offered 20 acres of land for a depot, as well as the right-of-way through town.Bryant Jr. 1974, p. 136Marshall 1945, pp. 203‚Äì204 To save money, the railroad used the right of way closely following the Cedar Fork Valley.City of Galesburg 2007, p. 10 =Station houses= First built in 1888, the station was made out of red sandstone. The two-story building had a slate roof and an octagonal tower facing the tracks. A unique feature of the station was that it had two different waiting rooms, one for men and one for women. In 1964, the building was demolished and replaced in by a smaller, one-story building.Linroth 2009, p. 170 The razing and construction of the new depot received mixed reactions by the residents of the town‚Äîmany of them thought that the depot could be restored. The railway asked the city of Galesburg to remove the grade crossing with Cedar Street, directly west of the depot. In return, the Santa Fe would build the new station, and use the space where the old depot stood for parking. It was not the only Amtrak station in Galesburg ‚Äì the other station, located on South Seminary Street, served the Illinois Zephyr and the California Zephyr. =Closure= In 1995, the Santa Fe and Burlington Northern railways merged to form the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. To allow trains to switch freely between lines, a connector outside Cameron, Illinois (southwest of Galesburg) was built. This connector (known as the Cameron Connector) allows the Southwest Chief to switch to the ex-CB&Q;, ex-BN track, where other Amtrak trains already operated. This combined with the amendment of track vital getting to Chicago Union Station, causing Amtrak to move all operations in Galesburg to the present station. This move also made stations in Chillicothe and Streator, Illinois lose service. Gallery File:Old Santa Fe Galesburg1.JPGThe site of the former station.

It aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 21, 2011. The title is a reference to the Nickelodeon kids' show Yo Gabba Gabba!. The show is also parodied within the episode: Leela‚Äôs show is similar, featuring people dressed up in fanciful costumes as its main characters. Plot Leela visits the Cookieville Orphanarium for a storytelling session with the children there, but fails to make up a good story for the orphans. Hoping to come up with a better story, and seeking quiet from her disruptive crewmates, Leela takes the Planet Express ship elsewhere to write. She returns to the orphanarium with her story at the same time as Abner Doubledeal, CEO of the TV station Tickleodeon, comes to pitch new television shows to the children. The orphans are unimpressed with the new shows, but they enjoy Leela's new story, called \\"Rumbledy-Hump\\" and using colourful characters and morals, prompting Doubledeal to persuade Leela to write an educational children's television series based on her story. Rumbledy-Hump, which is filmed in the Planet Express building and performed by Leela and the crew, quickly develops into a successful franchise. After her show wins at the Young People's Choice Awards, she becomes an egomaniac and starts to look down on her coworkers. She takes the Planet Express ship to her \\"quiet place\\" to write more episodes, but Bender, having stowed away to make out with a fembot from the awards ceremony, is aghast when he sees what Leela is doing: the \\"quiet place\\" is actually an unknown planet inhabited by the Rumbledy-Hump characters ‚Äî \\"the Humplings\\" ‚Äî who are real, and Leela's scripts are revealed to be word- for-word documentations of the Humplings' daily activities. Despite agreeing to give Bender half of the show's earnings in exchange for keeping the secret, Leela becomes wracked with guilt over exploiting the Humplings for profit, especially when the Cookieville orphans visit the building during filming and one of them, Sally, draws a picture of her own characters to thank Leela for inspiring her. Leela brings the crew, Doubledeal, and the orphans to the planet to meet the Humplings and confesses her deception, disappointing the orphans and the Humplings. But despite her initial dismay, Doubledeal comes up with a solution quickly, and takes advantage of the situation by turning \\"Rumbledy-Hump\\" into a reality show for kids. On top of that he adopts the orphans to work as his film crew, additionally cutting costs drastically for the show. This proves beneficial to both the Humplings, who are paid and thus able to afford better lifestyles, and the children, who now have full-time jobs and a parent to take care of them all, even declaring that they love life on the planet Rumbledy-hump. Leela is horrified that she is able to get away with making a bad example for the children, and pleads to be punished as the Humplings and children cheer and express their gratitude for her. Reception Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club generally praised the episode, giving it a B+ rating. Handlen praised the episode's humor and writing, but said that it continued \\"a general trend this season of competence over risk.\\" References External links Futurama (season 6) episodes 2011 American television episodes ","title":"Yo Leela Leela"},{"id":"31516940","text":"Ethiopia is a source country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced labor and forced prostitution. Girls from Ethiopia's rural areas are forced into domestic servitude and, less frequently, commercial sexual exploitation, while boys are subjected to forced labor in traditional weaving, gold mining, agriculture, herding, and street vending. Small numbers of Ethiopian girls are forced into domestic servitude outside Ethiopia, primarily in Djibouti and Sudan. While Ethiopian boys are subjected to forced labor in Djibouti as shop assistants and errand boys. Women from all parts of Ethiopia are subjected to involuntary domestic servitude throughout the Middle East and in Sudan, and many transit through Djibouti, Egypt, Libya, Somalia, or Yemen as they migrate to labor destinations. Ethiopian women in the Middle East face severe abuses, including physical and sexual assault, denial of salary, sleep deprivation, confinement, incarceration, and murder. Many are driven to despair and mental illness; some commit suicide. Some women are exploited in the sex trade after arriving at their destinations, particularly in brothels and near oil fields in Sudan. Small numbers of low-skilled Ethiopian men migrate to Saudi Arabia, Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and other African nations, where they are subjected to forced labor. During the year, the Somali Regional Security and Administration Office increased recruitment for Special Police Forces and local militias. It was reported that both government-supported forces and insurgent groups in the Degeharbur and Fik zones unlawfully recruited children, though these allegations could not be conclusively verified. The Government of Ethiopia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government made progress over the past year in addressing transnational trafficking through significantly increased law enforcement efforts. Due in part to the establishment of the Human Trafficking and Narcotics Section in the Organized Crime Investigation Unit of the Federal Police, there was an increased emphasis on investigation and prosecution of international trafficking crimes, although the continued lack of investigations and prosecutions of internal trafficking crimes remained a concern. The government maintained its efforts to provide assistance to child trafficking victims identified in the capital region.\\"Ethiopia\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed Ethiopia in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution Though the Ethiopian government has increased its efforts to prosecute and punish transnational trafficking offenders, prosecution of internal trafficking cases remains nonexistent. Article 635 of Ethiopia's Criminal Code (Trafficking in Women and Minors) criminalizes sex trafficking and prescribes punishments not exceeding five years' imprisonment. Articles 596 (Enslavement) and 597 (Trafficking in Women and Children) outlaw slavery and labor trafficking, and prescribe punishments of five to 20 years' rigorous imprisonment. These articles have rarely been used to prosecute trafficking offences. Instead, Articles 598 (Unlawful Sending of Ethiopians to Work Abroad) and 571 (Endangering the Life of Another) are more often used to prosecute cases of transnational labor trafficking. The Federal High Court's 11th Criminal Bench heard all cases of transnational trafficking, as well as internal trafficking cases discovered in the Addis Ababa jurisdiction. Between March and October 2009, the bench heard fifteen cases related to transnational labor trafficking, resulting in five convictions, nine acquittals, and one withdrawal due to missing witnesses. Of the five convictions, three offenders received suspended sentences of five years' imprisonment, two co-defendants were fined, and one offender is serving a sentence of five years' imprisonment. Thirty-one cases remained pending before the High Court at the end of the reporting period, including one involving alleged internal trafficking. The court successfully concluded the other eight cases, securing eight convictions under Articles 598 and 571 and ordering punishments ranging from five to twelve years' imprisonment, with no suspended sentences. In 2009, the Supreme Court's Justice Professionals Training Center incorporated anti-trafficking training into its routine training programs. Protection Although the government lacked the resources to provide direct assistance to trafficking victims or to fund NGO's to provide victim care, police employed victim identification and referral procedures in the capital, regularly referring identified child victims to NGO's for care. During the year, Child Protection Units (CPUs) ‚Äì joint police- NGO identification and referral teams operating in each of the 10 Addis Ababa police stations ‚Äì rescued and referred children to the eleventh CPU in the central bus terminal, which is dedicated exclusively to identifying and obtaining care for trafficked children. In 2009, this unit identified 1,134 trafficked children, an increase of 235 victims over the previous year. It referred 116 trafficked children to NGO shelters for care and family tracing, and reunified 757 children with parents or relatives in Addis Ababa and outlying regions. Local police and officials in the regional administrations assisted in the return of the children to their home areas; the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation provided free long-distance telephone service and the assistance of its employees across the country to enable the CPU to make contact with local officials. The Addis Ababa City Administration's Social and Civil Affairs Department reunified 26 trafficked children with their families in the regions and placed five in foster care. While police encouraged victims‚Äô participation in investigations and prosecutions, resource constraints prevented them from covering travel costs or providing other material resources to enable such testimony. There were no reports of trafficking victims detained, jailed, or prosecuted in 2009. Limited consular services provided to Ethiopian workers abroad continued to be a weakness in the government's efforts. It did, however, increase the number of officers at some of its missions by as much as 300 percent in 2009, and its consulate in Beirut resumed limited victim services, including the operation of a small safe house, mediation with domestic workers‚Äô employers, and visitation of workers held in the detention center. In July and December 2009, the Ethiopian Consulate General secured the release and repatriation of 42 and 75 victims, respectively, who were being held in Lebanon for immigration violations. The government showed only nascent signs of engaging destination country governments in an effort to improve protections for Ethiopian workers and obtain protective services for victims. Trafficked women returning to Ethiopia relied heavily on the few NGOs working with adult victims and psychological services provided by the government's Emmanuel Mental Health Hospital. In 2009, the Addis Ababa City Administration provided land for use by 10 female victims repatriated from Djibouti as a site for a self-help project. In addition, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Women's and Children's Affairs provided assistance to 75 victims repatriated from Lebanon in 2009, and assisted 12 victims repatriated from Israel with starting a cleaning business. The January 2009 Charities and Societies Proclamation prohibits, among other things, foreign-funded NGOs from informing victims of their rights under Ethiopian law or advocating on their behalf; these restrictions had a negative impact on the ability of NGOs to adequately provide protective services. Prevention Ethiopia's efforts to prevent international trafficking increased, while measures to heighten awareness of internal trafficking remained negligible. In November 2009, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) convened the Inter-Ministerial Task Force on Trafficking for the first time in more than two years. As a result, MOLSA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted a ‚ÄúNational Conference on Human Trafficking and Illegal Migration‚Äù in March 2010, which undertook the drafting of a national action plan. The government continued to ban its citizens from traveling to Lebanon, Syria, and Qatar for labor purposes. In July 2009, the government signed a bilateral labor agreement with the Government of Kuwait, which included provisions for increased anti-trafficking law enforcement cooperation; the agreement will become binding once it is passed by the House of People's Representatives, signed by the President, and published in the Gazette. Between July and December 2009, MOLSA's two full-time counselors provided 5,355 migrating workers with three-hour pre-departure orientation sessions on the risks of labor migration and the conditions in receiving countries; data was not available for the first half of the year. MOLSA also partnered with IOM to establish a database to track employment agencies authorized to send workers abroad, as well as worker complaints. Private Employment Agency Proclamation 104/1998, which governs the work of labor recruitment agencies and protects migrant workers from fraudulent recruitment or excessive debt situations, which could contribute to forced labor, prescribes punishments of five to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment. In August 2009, the government passed an amendment to this proclamation, Employment Exchange Services Proclamation No. 632/2009, outlawing extraneous commission fees, requiring agencies or their local affiliates to maintain a shelter for abused workers in each destination country, increasing agencies‚Äô cash and bond deposits as collateral in the event the worker's contract is broken, and mandating the establishment of labor attach√© positions in diplomatic missions abroad. To date, Parliament has not appropriated funds for MOLSA to establish these positions. During the year, the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region (SNNPR) regional government provided free radio time to a local NGO to air anti- trafficking outreach programming. Ethiopia's primary school textbooks include instruction on child labor and trafficking. The government did not undertake efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor during the reporting period. Before deploying soldiers on international peacekeeping missions, the government trained them on human rights issues, including human trafficking. Ethiopia is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

The episode was written by Michael Rowe and directed by Dwayne Carey- Hill. In the episode Fry nurtures an egg purchased at a farmers' market, which later hatches into a living creature, which he names Mr. Peppy. However, upon learning of Mr. Peppy's identity and dangerous nature, Fry and the Planet Express crew decide to set him free into its home planet. They do this, only to discover that the planet's inhabitants experienced problems with Mr. Peppy's species, hunting them to extinction and intending to do the same with Mr. Peppy. The episode's title is a reference from the Beatles song I Am the Walrus. In May and June 2011, as part of its \\"Countdown to Futurama\\" event, Comedy Central Insider, Comedy Central's news outlet, released various preview materials for the episode, including storyboards, concept art and a preview video clip of the episode. \\"Fry Am the Egg Man\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot Leela forces the crew to follow a strict diet of all-organic food after growing distrustful of the quality of fast food. Upon learning that this new diet includes fertile eggs, Fry decides to nurture one of the eggs until it hatches into a small blue creature with acidic saliva who Fry names Mr. Peppy. The creature quickly grows in size until he becomes large enough to tear off Bender's arm, after which the crew decides that Mr. Peppy is too dangerous for Fry to keep as a pet. They discover that Mr. Peppy is a bone vampire, so named because of its ability to suck out the skeletons of living creatures. Because bone vampires are extinct on their home planet of Doohan 6 and are capable of asexual reproduction, the crew releases Mr. Peppy into Doohan 6's wilderness to restore the species. Shortly after releasing Mr. Peppy, the crew learns from Doohan 6's locals that the bones of their livestock had been devoured by bone vampires, which led them to hunt the species to near-extinction. The planet's former bone vampire hunter Angus McZongo goes out to hunt Mr. Peppy when he seemingly breaks his vegetarian diet learned from Fry by attacking the planet's livestock. However, Fry decides to kill Mr. Peppy himself after he apparently attacks and injures Leela. Fry finds and shoots who he believes to be Mr. Peppy, only to discover it is Angus, who had learned that Mr. Peppy was a vegetarian after all and disguised himself as a bone vampire in an attempt to regain his popularity as a hunter (which also includes attacking Leela). Immediately after, the crew finds the real Mr. Peppy killing the planet's livestock for real, though the locals decide to let Mr. Peppy live to balance out their now overpopulated livestock, as well as to conveniently debone them for consumption. Production The episode was written by Michael Rowe and directed by Dwayne Carey-Hill. From May 30 to May 31, and again on June 19, as part of its \\"Countdown to Futurama\\" event, Comedy Central Insider, Comedy Central's news outlet, released various preview materials for the episode. On May 30, concept art of Mr. Peppy was released; on May 31, storyboards of Fry and Bender ordering food at the Fishy Joe's drive-thru were released; on June 19, a preview video clip of the episode was released. Cultural references The title is similar to the lyric 'I am the egg-man\\" in the song \\"I Am the Walrus\\". The bone vampires are similar to the legendary chupacabras rumoured to inhabit parts of the Americas. Professor Farnsworth reads about the bone vampires in a \\"medieval monster manual\\" which is a reference to a rulebook in Dungeons & Dragons. Furthermore, on its cover twenty sided die is seen, which are used in the game and the title \\"Gygaxicon\\" a reference to the game's co- creator Gary Gygax. The episode's conclusion references the usual conclusions of episodes of animated television series based around the American media franchise Scooby-Doo, particularly Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, and includes Amy uttering Scooby-Doo character Velma Dinkley's trademark catchphrase, \\"Jinkies!\\". The song portrayed during Fry's roosting montage is \\"Eggman\\" by Eli Wolfe. Doohan 6 is named after James Doohan, the man who portrayed Montgomery Scott in Star Trek. Reception In its original U.S. broadcast, \\"Fry Am the Egg Man\\" scored a 0.7 share among adults 18-49 and 1.462 million viewers, up about 3,000 views from the previous week's episode \\"M√∂bius Dick\\". The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club was positive towards the episode, describing it as \\"frequently snicker-worthy, a little bit sweet, and engaging throughout\\" and singling it out as one of his favorite episodes of the show's sixth season. Regarding the plot of \\"Fry Am the Egg Man\\", Gandert drew comparisons to recurring Futurama subplots regarding Leela and her pet Nibbler, and noted that the episode contained \\"familiar elements\\"; however, he noted that the episode \\"puts them together well, staying true to its characters and still managing to deliver a surprisingly happy ending.\\" He especially praised the episode's use of the character Mr. Peppy, writing: \\"The episode could've tried to play up the contrast between Fry's perpetual, unquestioning affection for the animal by making Peppy as cold and violent as possible; instead, the bone vampire is about as lovable as bone vampires get, despite still eating bones and having acidic saliva.\\" He gave the episode an overall A- rating. Robert Canning of IGN also enjoyed the episode, praising the execution and humor of its first two acts; he too noted similarities between the plot of \\"Fry Am the Egg Man\\" and recurring Leela‚ÄîNibbler subplots, and praised the episode for using darker and different-toned jokes to make sure that \\"Fry Am the Egg Man\\" did not feel like a rethread of these subplots. However, he criticized the episode's conclusion and final act, writing: \\"I really enjoyed 'Fry Am the Egg Man,' until the last act when things just sort of petered out. The silly vignettes of the opening gave way to an interesting conflict on a distant planet, only to deliver a relatively weak ending. Does the ending ruin the entire half hour? Not by much, but instead of being the classic it could have been, Thursday night's episode was only pretty darn good.\\" Giving the episode an overall 7.5/10 rating, he concluded his review by writing: \\"'Fry Am the Egg Man' was three-fourths of a fantastic episode. And then we got Scooby-Doo'd.\\" References External links 2011 American television episodes Futurama (season 6) episodes ","title":"Fry Am the Egg Man"},{"id":"31516965","text":"Fiji is a source country for children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution within the country, as well as a destination country for women from China in forced prostitution. Family members, other Fijian citizens, foreign tourists, and sailors on foreign fishing vessels participate in the commercial sexual exploitation of Fijian children. Staff at smaller, local hotels procure underage girls and boys for commercial sexual exploitation by foreign guests, while taxi drivers, nightclub employees, and relatives frequently act as prostitution facilitators. NGO's report caring for child victims of prostitution who claim facilitators took them to private boats anchored offshore near Fiji where they were sexually abused or raped by foreign adult men. Reports indicate that some transnational traffickers are members of Chinese organized crime groups that recruit women from China and arrange for them to enter Fiji on tourist or student visas. After their arrival, brothel owners confiscate their passports and force the women to engage in prostitution. Some Fijian children whose families follow a traditional practice of sending children to live with and do light work for relatives or families living in cities or near schools become trafficking victims. These children are subjected to involuntary domestic servitude or are coerced to engage in sexual activity in exchange for food, clothing, shelter, or school fees.\\"Fiji\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The Government of Fiji does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the last year, the Fijian government enacted a comprehensive anti-trafficking law, the Crimes Decree, which defines trafficking as a crime of compelled service which does not necessarily involve crossing a border or otherwise moving a victim, and includes several innovative provisions to protect both adult and child trafficking victims. The government conducted anti-trafficking conferences and training for law enforcement personnel, where high-level officials spoke out strongly against trafficking and committed themselves to fighting this crime in Fiji. It also actively engaged with the media to raise public awareness, and is in the process of developing procedural guidelines for suspected trafficking cases. Fiji had one successful prosecution for human trafficking in November 2010. The U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Prosecution The Government of Fiji increased its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the year. The government was limited in its ability to focus on combating trafficking in persons by an ongoing political and economic crisis. While no trafficking offenders were investigated, arrested, prosecuted, or convicted during the reporting period, the government took some steps to strengthen its capacity for future law enforcement action. On February 1, 2010, the government enacted a new Crimes Decree, which repealed the archaic Penal Code. Comprehensive anti-trafficking provisions in the Crimes Decree fill anti- trafficking gaps in the Immigration Act of 2003 which prohibited transnational human trafficking, but did not differentiate between labor and sex trafficking. The prescribed penalties of up to 25 years‚Äô imprisonment and in some cases fines of over $400,000 under the new Crimes Decree are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. A new Sentencing and Penalties Decree designed to bring about more uniform judgments in the courts may ensure that minimum sentences for convicted trafficking offenders are also sufficiently stringent. The Crimes Decree also prohibits actions not previously covered by earlier laws, and prohibits using threats or fraud, or administering drugs to procure prostitution, and holds householders or landlords liable for permitting the defilement of a child under 16 on their premises. Fiji has had one successful prosecution for human trafficking under the Crimes Decree. On November 10, 2010, Kadali Murti was convicted of 1 count of trafficking in persons and 7 counts of obtaining property by deception. He was sentenced on November 17, 2010 to 6 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 4 years. Law enforcement officials began to receive training from the government on the new Crimes Decree, including the new trafficking offenses, in January 2010. A Combined Law Agencies Group (CLAG) continued to meet monthly to address law enforcement issues, including trafficking in persons. There is no evidence of government officials‚Äô complicity in trafficking. Protection The Government of Fiji began to improve its efforts to protect trafficking victims over the last year. Due to severe resource constraints, the government primarily relied on NGOs or international organizations to provide most protective services to victims. The government did not identify any trafficking victims during the year. Law enforcement, immigration, and social service agencies did not develop or use formal procedures to proactively identify victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations with which they had contact, such as women and girls in prostitution and illegal immigrants. The government did not operate any victim care facilities specifically for trafficking victims, but provided limited services to child sex trafficking victims at shelters for child victims of any crime or abuse. Courts granted custody of child victims to the Department of Social Welfare, which operates four homes, with separate facilities for boys and girls. At present, however, both child victims of sexual abuse and accused child offenders are placed in the home for boys. The government provided no shelter facilities for adult trafficking victims, and it did not refer possible adult trafficking victims to shelters and drop-in centers run by NGOs for assistance. One NGO provided assistance to seven victims of human trafficking. Authorities undertook no investigation into the circumstances of suspected victims of trafficking and deported five Chinese women arrested for engaging in prostitution in August 2009. Anti-trafficking laws include provisions to ensure that sex trafficking victims are not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. The new Crimes Decree contains significant protection provisions for children, making it an offense to buy, hire, or otherwise obtain possession of any child under the age of 18 years with the intent that the minor shall at any age be employed or used for the purpose of exploitation, and authorizing the court to divest authority from a parent or guardian over a minor under 21 years if the court believes the parent or guardian is responsible for the seduction, prostitution or unlawful detention of that minor. Prevention The Government of Fiji increased its efforts to raise awareness about trafficking during the year, although it had no national plan of action to address trafficking during the reporting period. The government acted to raise both public and official awareness of trafficking. It developed and provided internal training for police and court personnel on the new Crimes Decree‚Äôs trafficking provisions. The government worked with the media to raise awareness of trafficking. High-level officials condemned trafficking and announced their commitment to fight this crime during press conferences. Relevant ministries and agencies provided information to media outlets and encouraged them to release news stories on trafficking. The CLAG, the National Coordinating Committee on Children (NCCC), and representatives from various ministries met regularly to discuss legislative and policy issues concerning children, including child sexual abuse which may be linked to trafficking. The new Crimes Decree nullified earlier law, which allowed for sex trafficking victims to be treated as criminals. The Crimes Decree criminalizes those purchasing sex from trafficking victims, whereas the older Penal Code had criminalized only prostituted persons and pimps. In addition, Fiji‚Äôs new sexual abuse laws have extraterritorial coverage to allow the prosecution of suspected Fijian sex tourists for crimes committed abroad. Anti-trafficking laws apply to Fijians deployed abroad as part of peacekeeping missions, and the Fijian government provided anti-trafficking training for troops prior to their deployment on international peacekeeping missions. Fiji is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Such media representation is not always seen in a positive light and propagates controversial and misconstrued images of what African Americans represent. \\"Research on the portrayal of African Americans in prime-time television from 1955 to 1986 found that only 6 percent of the characters were African-Americans, while 89 percent of the TV population was white.\\" This under-representation has reversed, however, according to a 2018 report from the Department of Social Sciences at UCLA, which states that, despite making up less than 13% of the US population, \\"Blacks were overrepresented among actors in broadcast scripted shows in 2015-16, claiming 17 percent of the roles.\\" Since local news media is a primary source of information for many people, it plays a vital role in policy debates regarding civil rights, the public's general knowledge of minority communities, as well as a broader and more comprehensive worldview. The debate of ownership diversity affecting content diversity also contributes to the idea that in order for African Americans to be well represented in the media, there needs to be African-American ownership in the media. Examples of misrepresentation  Little Black Sambo is an 1899 children's book where the protagonist, a South Indian boy, encounters four hungry tigers. To avoid being eaten by the tigers, he surrenders his colorful new clothes, shoes, and umbrella. The tigers chase each other around a tree until they are reduced to a pool of melted butter. Sambo recovers his clothes, and his mother makes pancakes with the butter.\\"The Story of Little Black Sambo\\". Sterlingtimes.co.uk Sambo was depicted as a perpetual child, not capable of living as an independent adult\\". It was said that Little Black Sambo \\"demonstrates rigid, reductive stereotyping, but it was seen as harmless entertainment in 1935. This clip helps show the tremendous cultural shift that has occurred, as this kind of representation is no longer acceptable. \\"The coon caricature is one of the most insulting of all anti-Black caricatures. The name itself, an abbreviation of raccoon, is dehumanizing. As with Sambo, the coon was portrayed as a lazy, easily frightened, chronically idle, inarticulate buffoon. The coon acted childish, but he was an adult; albeit a good-for-little adult. Viewed 3 May 2011. Amos 'n' Andy was a radio-show- turned-television-show from the 1920s through the 1950s about two lower-class African-American men who moved to Chicago, hoping to start a better life. The first sustained protest against the program found its inspiration in the December 1930 issue of Abbott's Monthly, when Bishop W.J. Walls of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church wrote an article sharply denouncing Amos 'n' Andy, singling out the lower-class characterizations and the \\"crude, repetitious, and moronic\\" dialogue. The Pittsburgh Courier was the nation's second largest African-American newspaper at the time, and publisher Robert Vann expanded Walls's criticism into a full-fledged crusade during a six-month period in 1931. Al Jolson, a Lithuanian-born vaudeville comedian and blackface \\"Mammy\\" singer, lived \\"The American Dream\\". In a Caucasian comedy, Jolson played a \\"fumbling idiot\\" stereotypical African American. Although he did bring African-American culture to the spotlight, another blackface performer at the time, Bert Williams, found the performance both vulgar and repressive. Negative portrayals of black men on TV, the internet, newspaper articles, and video games can be linked, in part, to lower life expectancies. This was found in a study done in 2011 done by the Opportunity Agenda. Another study done shows just how many under representations of black men there actually are. It relates African Americans to drug related crimes which was very exaggerated. = Representation of African-American women = The representation of African-American women in media has changed throughout the years. According to Sue Jewell, an urban sociology researcher at the Ohio State University from 1982 to 2011, there are typically three main archetypes of African-American women in media ‚Äì the Mammy, the Sapphire, and the Jezebel. The Mammy archetype was created during the period of slavery to convey what was acceptable of a slave woman to do and say. This image of a slave woman translated into an asexual, maternal figure. The Mammy archetype manifested, for the most part, in literary works and films during the mid-1900s and was reimagined during the 1980s. A popular manifestation of this archetype is Aunt Jemima. The second archetype of African-American women, as described by Jewell, is the Sapphire woman. The Sapphire woman, also known as the angry Black woman, is hostile and emasculates Black men through various insults. This archetype was popular during the 1940s and 1950s, created by the Amos and Andy radio show. The Jezebel archetype, the third described by Jewell, was created in contrast to the ideals of the Mammy slave woman. The Jezebel is a slave woman that satisfied the sexual needs of their white slave masters, and was used to justify the rape of Black slave women. Women who fit this archetype were depicted as fitting European standards of beauty. Some experts maintain that these historical stereotypes have persisted throughout history and actually influenced the creation of more modern stereotypes. These new stereotypes include the welfare queen, the gold digger, and the video vixen. The first is characterized by her sexual promiscuity and schemes for getting money, the second for her exploitation of good-hearted men, and the third for her sexual promiscuity as well.  Hip-hop music  The misrepresentation of African- American women has permeated into the music industry, more specifically hip- hop/rap videos. In this form of media, Black women's bodies have been historically hyper-sexualized through images of exotic dancers dressed in a provocative way. In an attempt to oppose those who perpetuate the misrepresentation of Black women, students at Spelman College cancelled a bone-marrow drive in the spring of 2004. They did so as a form of protest against rapper Nelly's, a prominent sponsor of the event, sexist lyrics and videos. The number of Black women in the music industry has increased throughout the years, despite the industry's focusing on the works of African- American men. African-American women have used the hip-hop genre to increase their representation and reconstruct what their identity means to them, taking the power into their own hands. Famous female African-American rappers include Queen Latifah, Lauryn Hill, Salt NPeppa, Lil‚Äô Kim, Missy Eliot, Nicky Minaj, and Cardi B. Famous African-American rappers include Kanye West, Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Lil Wayne.  Beauty industry  Scholars, such as Tracy Owens Patton, have stated that the beauty industry predominantly focuses on and caters to white and European standards of beauty. African-American women have had to navigate these biased beauty standards when it comes to their hair and body image. African slave women were held to the standards of white women, often obtaining better treatment if they had lighter skin or a body type that was similar to their white counterparts. African American women have to change the appearance of their hair in order to fit European standards of beauty, from a young age. The beauty salon has become a way for African-American women to organize for empowerment and health education in their communities. = Reality television = Reality television shows such as Bad Girls Club, The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and Love & Hip Hop have received criticism and been discussed for their portrayal of Black women, many of whom are depicted as Sapphires, Mammies, and Jezebels. This has led to people, such as Donnetrice Allison, associate professor of Communication Studies and Africana Studies at Stockton University, to state that these shows serve as a new platform for these archetypes to thrive in modern day culture and society. = Representation of Black/African-American LGBT characters = The 1990s had an increased representation of LGBT characters in film and TV. Since this period of time, the visibility of LGBT characters of color have increased, however the majority of the LGBT characters are still depicted as gay white males. The LGBT media monitoring organization GLAAD publishes annual reports on representation in film and television, the \\"Studio Responsibility Index (SRI)\\" and \\"Where We Are On TV (WWAT)\\", respectively. The first SRI was published in 2013 and found that of the 101 films released by major studios in 2012, only 14 films had LGBT characters and, in those films, only 31 different characters could be identified as LBGTQ. Of these 31 characters, only four were Black/African-American (12.9%) in comparison to 26 white characters making up 83.9% of LGBT representation in films for this year. The 2016 report showed a small increase, with 23 out of 125 films containing LGBT characters. Of the 70 LGBT characters, 9 were Black/African-American (13%) in comparison to 48 white characters (69%). The 2013 WWAT report showed that there were 112 LGBT characters that were announced for broadcast and cable and of these characters, 13% were black while 71% were white. The 2017 report found that there were 329 LBGTQ characters on television. Black LGBT characters made up 12% of this representation with 40 characters compared to 65% for white characters. Outlets such as the Pacific Center for Human Growth and Color of Change have been critical of depictions of black LGBT characters, stating that media outlets often rely on one-dimensional, stereotypical images of Black characters as opposed to dynamic and complex portrayals that reflect the complexity and authenticity of Black people's lives around the country. Critics have further stated that black characters are typically incorporated within \\"hegemonic white worlds void of any hint of African American traditions, social struggle, racial conflicts, and cultural difference.\\" According to Dustin Collins, Black gay men are usually portrayed in the media as \\"swishy queens\\" or overly aggressive. The character of Keith Charles, a gay black man, in Six Feet Under has been cited as an example of this in a 2013 Sexuality and Culture article by Jay Poole. He argued that Keith is portrayed as overly masculine, aggressive, and powerful which reinforces stereotypical characteristics of African-American men. This is in comparison to his partner, David Fisher, a white gay man, who is portrayed as more feminine as he is in charge of household duties. Lafayette Reynolds of True Blood has also been seen as a black LGBT stereotype, as his character is portrayed as a flamboyant \\"swishy queen\\" with an athletic, muscular build and can be very aggressive. In contrast, Jennifer De Clue has highlighted the film Moonlight as breaking from the stereotype of the over-masculinity of black LGBT characters, as the main character, Chiron Harris, is physically abused for being gay and not fitting into the ideal definitions of masculinity. Black lesbians are typically associated with aggression, eroticism, extreme attractiveness/desirability (femme), and occasionally butch. In Set It Off, Ursula, a black lesbian character is represented by only being an erotic object. Most of her scenes are her sexual interactions with her girlfriend Cleo. Cleopatra \\"Cleo\\" Sims, also a black lesbian, is seen as being aggressive and butch. In The Wire, Shakima Greggs is portrayed as masculine and part of the Baltimore police department's \\"old boy's club\\". Felicia Pearson is seen as extremely masculine/butch to the point where her gender presentation is blurred between female and male. Transgender women are typically portrayed as passing as women making them seem artificial or fake. Transgender women of color are also disproportionately represented as victims of hate crimes. The character, Sophia Burset, from the Netflix series, Orange is the New Black is a black trans woman, who reinforces these stereotypes since she has used medical surgery and hormones to appear more as a woman. Other characters in this show constantly make comments indicating they view Sophia as not a real woman. Writer Michael Chavez also argues that Sophia plays into the stereotypical hyperfeminization of trans women in the media through her role of the hairdresser in the prison salon and knowledge of hair, fashion, and makeup. Additionally, drugs, violence and low socioeconomic status are usually part of the identity of black LGBT characters. These stereotypical representations of black LGBT characters reinforce the cultural stereotypes in the United States that all black people are poor, extremely violent, and/or drug abusers.  Television  The portrayals of African Americans in movies and television shows in America reinforce negative stereotypes. Professor Narissra M. Punyanunt-Carter, from the department of Communications Studies at Texas Tech, found many facts in her research paper, The Perceived Realism of African American Portrayals on Television, \\"After reviewing numerous television shows, Seggar and Wheeler (1973) found that African Americans on these programs were generally depicted in service or blue-collar occupations, such as a house cleaner or a postal worker\\". This is in contrast to their white counter-parts who are business executives and business owners. \\"In contrast to White characters, research indicates that that African Americans have lower socioeconomic status (SES) roles on television than Anglo Americans\\" (Segger & Wheeler, 1973) (pp243). She also found that \\"the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1977) found that African American television portrayals typically depicted the following stereotypic personality characteristics: inferior, stupid, comical, immoral, and dishonest\\"(pp243). Seeing negative images on television, and film of African Americans can be seen as a covert propaganda that transitively affects the subconscious mind, and negatively shapes the psychology of the observer. Carter also echoed this by illustrating what she found in another research study. She said, \\"Fujioka's study illustrated that when firsthand knowledge is not present, television images have a huge effect on viewers' perceptions. In addition, this study found cultural differences in responses to positive images of Blacks among Japanese and American students. American students tended to be more influenced by negative messages of Blacks than Japanese students Fujioka's research affirmed that affective assessments of television portrayals of African Americans are highly related to the development of stereotypes\\"(pp244). All the negative imagery goes back to the Antebellum Era (before the fall of slavery)1793‚Äì1861.  Sports  Sports are a piece of life that many people hold near and dear to their heart. In sports that are featured in media such as on ESPN and some other sports channels, representation of African-American men and women is important. In the past, segregation played a part in representation of the community. ‚ÄúIn baseball, there were established ‚ÄòNegro‚Äô leagues for non-white players (while these leagues were predominantly African-American, there were also several Latin-Americans playing in the leagues, as well) through the early 1950s‚Äù (Keifer, Mitchell). In her article, Andrea Eagleman talks about the history of the representation. ‚ÄúResearch shows that racial and ethnic minority athletes and international athletes have long been portrayed in stereotypical roles in the mass media since the 1880s, when Black players were stereotyped‚Ä¶‚Äù(Eagleman, Andrea). Reasons for misrepresentation =Working in the media= Historically, the participation in media production by minorities in the US has been low. Despite recent gains especially in television, significant racial disparities remain. In 1971, three years after the Federal Communications Commission adopted rules to foster more diverse programming, only nine percent of full-time employees in radio and television were visible minorities. In 1978, American Society of News Editors set a goal to have their sector mirror the diversity of the American population in general. As the years progressed, the percentage of minorities in the workplace began to grow; in 1997, visible minorities made up 20 percent of the broadcasting work force. Yet the trend towards inclusiveness, while generally growing, has been uneven. For example, a 2007 report showed that blacks, Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans made up only 13.65% of American newsrooms. The numbers dwindle still further at the upper levels of media management: during the 2013‚Äì2014 season only 5.5% of executive-level television producers were people of color. = Ownership = Ownership in the media helps control what media is being broadcast, which also helps define who and how people are being portrayed. There is a significant under representation of African Americans when it comes to the ownership of media. A report by the Free Press entitled \\"Off The Dial\\" reports of all commercial broadcast radio stations, African Americans own only 3.4%. In populations with large African-American markets, the number of black-owned stations are not correlated with the large market. Difficulty with capital access along with other barriers to entry may be the cause. African-American owners may be purchasing broadcast stations in the only place they can ‚Äì small midwestern markets, due to racism in small southern communities where the black population exists in the majority. Therefore, a valuable media perspective is lost in these communities. =Stereotypes= Communication and media research suggest that the mass media is an important source of information about African Americans and their image. This public image influences public perception, and is capable of reinforcing opinions about African Americans. Typically, these opinions are unfavorable and highlight negative stereotypes associated with African Americans. Oftentimes the portrayals' very medium, such as television, is the origin of such stereotypes. Television has been cited for broadcasting material that displays an overrepresentation of African Americans as lawbreakers. A study of TV crime newscasts indicated that newscast content displayed far more counts of African Americans' crimes than that of any other racial classification. The representation of African Americans in media has remained the same for a while, almost since the representation of African Americans in television ads exceeded in 1991. It has been shown that even positive stereotypes of African Americans in media can have an effect of prejudice on consumers. The roles of African Americans in media has evolved over time. On typical cable channels the amount of ads shown with African Americans has become neutral, but on channels such as B.E.T.BET where the viewership is mostly that of African Americans, all of the ads consist of healthy, stable, independent and enthusiastic African Americans who are goal oriented. African Americans now have bigger roles in media such as that of reporters, business owners and artists. African-American women have made an uprising in mainstream media as confident and strong individuals. Several organizations have been based on the empowerment of African-American women in media. The representation of African-American women in media has also made an increase since beauty expectations have changed. Cultural appropriationCultural appropriation has somewhat changed the beauty standards of media. Fashion styles have taken on the cultural dynamics of many countries.  Minority Ownership Task Force  The lack of representation has spawned a number of U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) initiatives to increase diversity. In 1969 the Supreme Court ruled that the implicated FCC regulations that were designed to increase viewpoint diversity were not in conflict with the First Amendment, and the people \\"as a whole\\" retain their interest in free speech and the right to have \\"diverse programming\\" via the constitution.Red Lion Broad. Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 357 (1969) In the 1960s the release of a report by the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (the Kerner Commission) reported that the \\"media\\" did not effectively communicate to the majority of their decidedly white audience the sense of \\"degradation, misery, and hopelessness of living in the ghetto.\\"Worthy, Diversity and Media Stereotyping p511 quoting Kerner Commission Report of the NAC on Civil Disorders (1968). The commission also continued to report that unless the media became more sensitive to the portrayal of African Americans specifically, the degrading stereotypical content would continue to be displayed. In response to this commission, the FCC initiated a race-neutral regulatory policy to increase the likelihood that African Americans would be employed with a broadcaster.Petition for Rule making to Require Broadcast Licensees to Show Nondiscrimination in Their Employment Practices, 13 F.CC.2d 766,774 (1968). This included changing hiring practices of broadcasters to eliminate racial discrimination from the employment process. However, despite these rules, the FCC found that levels of representation did not change significantly.Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcasting Facilities, 68 FCC2d 979 (1978) To continue its effort to provide access to the \\"minority voice\\", the FCC established the Minority Ownership Task Force (MOTF). This group would focus on researching ways to include minorities in the broadcasting industry. The FCC notes that having a sufficient representation of the minority would be serving the needs of not only the interests of the minority community, but would \\"enrich and educate\\" the majority. Metro Broadcasting v. FCC The case of Metro Broadcasting v. FCC in 1990 challenged the constitutionality of two minority preference policies of the Federal Communications Commission. Under the first policy challenged by Metro Broadcasting, Inc., minority applicants for broadcast licenses were given preference if all other relevant factors were roughly equal. The second policy, known as the \\"distress sale,\\" was challenged by Shurberg Broadcasting of Hartford, Inc. This policy allowed broadcasters in danger of losing their licenses to sell their stations to minority buyers before the FCC formally ruled on the viability of the troubled stations. The FCC's minority preference policies were constitutional because they provided appropriate remedies for discrimination victims and were aimed at the advancement of legitimate congressional objectives for program diversity. The FCC's minority preference policies were closely related to, and substantially advanced, Congress's legitimate interest in affording the public a diverse array of programming options. The availability of program diversity serves the entire viewing and listening public, not just minorities, and is therefore consistent with First Amendment values.

Finnish legislation condemns trafficking as a crime and has met the standards of the EU Protocol even before the convention came into effect. NGOs and the government cooperate in providing help for the victims of trafficking in Finland. Although the Finnish Police investigated and referred more people to care in 2013, prosecution and conviction numbers of suspected offenders remain low relative to the number of potential victims. The government is currently working on improving the anti-trafficking laws and practices to improve the situation. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Human trafficking Human trafficking is the trade of humans that can occur internationally or within a nation, often with a goal of forced marriage, sexual slavery, forced labor, commercial sexual exploitation or the removal of organs. Newest forms of human trafficking include ova and surrogacy trade. Persons that are victims of human trafficking are usually recruited or taken by the means of the threat or use of force, or by fraud, kidnapping, deception, abuse of power or a vulnerable position with the aim of exploitation. Some of the biggest reasons for human trafficking are poverty, the global level of gender inequality and the feminization of poverty as well as different kinds of conflicts, cataclysms, religious and ethnic persecutions, violence and discrimination (of especially women). Prevalence Identifying a person as a victim of trafficking is one of the most difficult tasks when measuring human trafficking. According to Eurostat's 'Trafficking in human beings': \\"In accordance with Directive 2011/36/EU, the term \\"identified victim\\" refers to persons who have been formally identified by the relevant authorities as a victim of trafficking in human beings. The term \\"presumed victim\\" on the other hand is used for trafficking victims who have met the criteria of the EU Directive but have not been formally identified by the relevant formal authorities as a trafficking victim or who have declined to be formally or legally identified as a trafficking victim.\\" A total of 30,146 identified and presumed victims were registered in the 28 EU Member States in 2010‚Äì2012, out of which over a thousand were children trafficked for sexual exploitation. 80 percent of registered victims were female, and 65 percent of registered victims were EU citizens. Of the registered victims who are confirmed as EU citizens, the top 5 countries of citizenship are Bulgaria, Romania, the Netherlands, Hungary and Poland. Over the three years, the top 5 non-EU countries of citizenship of registered victims were Nigeria, Brazil, China, Viet Nam and Russia. There has been an increase in the number of ¬®unknown¬® citizenships from 2010 to 2011. In addition, 71 percent of labor exploitation victims were male in the EU Member States during these three years. Finland is both a transit and a destination country for human trafficking, but human trafficking is less prevalent in Finland than it is in most other EU countries. To some extent Finland is also considered a source country for human trafficking. No incidents of organ trade have been detected in Finland, and trafficking tends to mostly appear in forms of prostitution and procuring (pimping), as well as labor exploitation. Labor exploitation is especially prevalent in berry picking, restaurant, cleaning, metal, transportation, construction and gardening industries as well as in personal households. According to statistics provided by Eurostat, in 2010‚Äì2012 there was a total of 231 registered victims of human trafficking in Finland. The Finnish Police estimate that about 200-250 women cross the Finnish border from the East weekly to work as prostitutes in Finland. Annually about 10,000‚Äì15,000 prostitutes spend some amount of time working in Finland. These women are mostly from Russia, Estonia and to some extent from Lithuania and Latvia. A chance of these women being forced to work as prostitutes cannot be excluded. In comparison, the corresponding number of registered victims of human trafficking in Sweden was 311, 179 in Denmark, 125 in Norway, 135 in Estonia and 4,474 in United Kingdom. Finland is also known to be a transit country for trafficking in children. The children that pass through Finland come mostly from East Asia and they are headed elsewhere in Europe. In Finland, children of immigrants still in the process of seeking asylum are considered to be at risk for being trafficked: a number of children have disappeared from the centers where immigrants stay during the asylum process, so trafficking of children with the aim of exploiting them sexually might also take place in Finland. Fewer than a hundred people seek help from the aid shelters annually in Finland. For the first half of 2019, in a six- month period from January to June Finland's Assistance System for Victims of Human Trafficking (Migri) reported 115 human trafficking cases, of which most common were forced marriage and being made to work without workers rights in agriculture or restaurants. Seven reported having been sexually harassed. The victims were mainly from Afghanistan (17), Nigeria (16), Iraq (15), Somalia (15), Cameroon (7) and Romania (5). Reporting and conviction rates The sword insignia of Finnish police A total of 8,551 prosecutions were reported by EU Member States over the years 2010-2012 for human trafficking. Of those cases, in 3,786 the prosecuted was convicted for human trafficking. More than 70 percent of suspected traffickers were male in the EU Member States. Traffickers are often adult males who operate in the country where they are from, but more women and foreigners are involved in human trafficking than in most other crimes. Although most of those prosecuted and/or convicted for trafficking in persons are men, trafficking has a quite high rate of females involved in it. Very few other crimes record a level of female participation in committing the crime such as that of human trafficking. Venla Roth, Senior Adviser in Office of the Ombudsman for Minorities and the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings, has stated that the conviction rates are so low because in many cases in which the trafficker controlled the victim, the trafficker can say they were not aware of the fact that the victim was dependent on them. Taking advantage of a person's dependence is one of the details defining trafficking in the Finnish Penal Code. Since 2006, sentences have ranged from 1.5 to 5.5 years imprisonment: there were no reports of suspended sentences. The government did not prosecute any persons for suspected child sex tourism offenses in 2009.Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). There were 23 trafficking investigations in Finland in 2012, while the number of people prosecuted for trafficking in 2012 was eight. Eight trafficking offenders were prosecuted in 2012. In 2013, there were 12 sex trafficking investigations and 15 labor trafficking investigations in Finland, and 19 persons were prosecuted for trafficking. Two labor trafficking offenders were convicted in 2013 with sentences of 30 months‚Äô imprisonment, which was a smaller number of convictions than the year before. In four additional cases, five other people were persecuted for trafficking but not found guilty. However, they were convicted on lesser charges. Additionally, the prior convictions of three human trafficking offenders were upheld by two appellate courts. No offenders were convicted for sex trafficking in 2013.\\"Finland\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). The government also encourages victims of human trafficking to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders. In 2013, 12 victims assisted law enforcement in pre-trial investigations, 10 of whom participated in the prosecutions of alleged traffickers. Illegal immigration is also criminalized in Finland. It is an offence often associated with human trafficking because the persons being trafficked are considered clients of the smugglers or traffickers. The number of persons using fake or illegal travelling documents in border controls was over 200 in the year 2000. Only a few of these cases have resulted in prosecution. Law Finland has ratified the Conventions of 1926 which deals with slavery, and the Convention of 1949 which deals with trafficking in human beings and counteracting the exploitation of other people's prostitution, with their subsequent amendments. The national legislation on human trafficking and prostitution is mostly based on these conventions and their requirements. The whole 25th chapter of Finnish Penal Code deals with crimes on freedoms of persons. However, the only part in Finnish Penal Code that directly addresses human trafficking is ¬ß 25:3 and ¬ß 25:3a (9.7.2004/650). According to these two sections, both human trafficking and aggravated human trafficking, as well as the attempt of either, are punishable crimes in Finland. The laws on human trafficking came to effect in the Penal Code 1. August 2004. Prior to this, cases of human trafficking were punishable bylaws that dealt with procuring and discrimination at work. If convicted for human trafficking, the offender is prescribed a minimum of four months and a maximum of six years in prison. The penalty scale for aggravated trafficking in human beings is 2 to 10 years in prison. Penalties commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Although the government does not have a specialized anti-trafficking law enforcement unit, it integrated formal anti-trafficking awareness into police and border guard training curricula for new recruits and in-service personnel. The government has also provided anti-trafficking training to its prosecutors for the past four years. The government also distributed leaflets to thousands of visitors at a major annual travel fair warning that child sex tourism is a crime. Finland's laws provide extraterritorial jurisdiction over child sex tourism offenses perpetrated overseas by Finnish nationals. =Definitions of human trafficking in the Penal Code= The definition of human trafficking is strict in the Penal Code. To fulfill the criteria for human trafficking it is crucial that the victim has been deceived or that the victim's dependent or insecure position has been taken advantage of when subjecting the person to work as, for example, a prostitute. Trafficking in persons is a crime against the individual. The sections below are translated from the Finnish Penal Code. Human trafficking 3 ¬ß (9.7.2004/650) A person who * takes advantage of the victim's dependent or insecure position or the victim is pressured * deceives the victim or takes advantage of the victim's deception * is paid compensation to a person who is keeping a victim under his/her control * receives a compensation for oppressing a victim, recruiting a victim or for handing over, transporting, receiving or housing a victim with the aim of sexually exploiting him/her in a way described in the first clause of 9 ¬ß in the 20th chapter of Finnish Penal Code. Alternatively, a person who aims to take sexual advantage of the victim in a way that is comparable to the first clause of 9 ¬ß in the 20th chapter of Finnish Penal Code, or if he/she receives compensation for oppressing or recruiting a victim or for handing over, transporting, receiving or housing a victim with an aim of labor exploitation, or subjecting the victim to circumstances that violate human dignity or removal of organs or tissue, should be convicted. Chapter 20, 9 ¬ß (24.7.1998/563), first clause: a person who has organized a room or another space to be used for sexual intercourse or an act comparable to that, or if the space is to be used for a sexual act or an act comparable and that clearly violates sexual modesty and is committed by a child under the age of 18 should be convicted for human trafficking and sentenced to a minimum of four months and a maximum of six years of prison time. (19.12.2014/1177) A person who oppresses a person younger than 18 years old or recruits, hands over, transports, receives or houses the underage person with an aim mentioned in the first clause should be convicted even if none of the means mentioned in the first clause were used. An attempt is also punishable. Aggravated human trafficking 3 a ¬ß (9.7.2004/650) The human trafficking is considered aggravated if * it uses violence, threatening or treachery in addition or instead of the means mentioned in 3 ¬ß * it intentionally or with gross negligence causes the victim severe bodily harm, a serious illness or another life-threatening condition or considerable suffering comparable to those * the offense is committed against a child who is under 18 years old or against a person whose ability to defend him/herself is substantially impaired, or * if the offense is committed as a part of operations by an organized criminal group as mentioned in the fourth clause of 1a¬ß in the 17th chapter of the Penal Code Chapter 17, 1 a ¬ß (21.2.2003/142), fourth clause: a person who acquires, attempts to acquire or hand over business premises or any other spaces, means of transport, or crucial equipment the organized crime group might require and if the crime is grave as a whole, the offender should be convicted for aggravated human trafficking and sentenced to 2‚Äì10 years in prison. A person who enslaves a victim, transports slaves or sells them, and if the offense if the offense is aggravated when assessed as a whole. An attempt is also punishable. Protection =Government= The Finnish government continued to provide direct shelter, trafficking-specific rehabilitative assistance, and medical care to adult and child victims in addition to its provision of funding for NGO-run shelters. Police and border guard officials used a series of written guidelines on victim referral and treatment developed by the Finnish Immigration Service to proactively identify victims of trafficking; however, one official raised concerns that the threshold for referral to services was too high. During the reporting period, officials referred 13 victims to service providers, raising concerns about the low number of potential victims identified and the effectiveness of victim identification procedures. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders. Under the Act on Compensation for Crime Damage, victims of crime could receive government compensation for personal injury, damage to property, or other financial loss caused by a crime. Finnish authorities provided identified trafficking victims with a six-month reflection period, a time for victims to receive immediate care and assistance while they consider whether to assist law enforcement. There were no indications, however, that the reflection period was used extensively. Victims of trafficking wishing to stay longer than six months were eligible to apply for an extended residence permit or asylum as an alternative to deportation. The government granted permanent residence permits to seven victims during the reporting period. The government made some effort to ensure victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. The government provided anti-trafficking awareness training for labor inspectors, diplomatic personnel, public health workers, immigration adjudication staff and Finnair flight attendants. =Pro-support Centre= The Pro-support Centre was established in 1990. It is a support service centre for prostitutes, subordinated to the private Diacone Institution in Helsinki. The main purpose of this cente is to provide health care and social services. In 2002, this centre was the only organisation in Finland that offered support services for prostitutes, whether Finnish or foreign. Most of the centre's activities were concentrated in the areas in close proximity to the capital. The centre does not collect or file systematic information about the clients who come and seek help, and its employees work under a secrecy obligation. However, the employees of the support centre have the most long-standing and thorough knowledge of the prostitution situation and its developments in the Helsinki region, and this experience is also available for outside research purposes. Pro-support Centre holds the role of the third sector in very high regard when it comes to anti-human trafficking. The centre carried out a project together with Finland's Slot Machine Association (RAY) in 2007‚Äì2009. The goal of the project was to produce new information on human trafficking and other similar phenomena in Finland, as well as to evaluate the existing support network for the victims of human trafficking and their families. Simultaneously many professionals who work closely with human trafficking and related phenomena, were trained to better recognize and support the victims of human trafficking. Prevention Many different kinds of organizations work together in efforts to prevent human trafficking in Finland. Some of these organizations are subordinated to the government and its ministries, some to the military and some are third sector organizations. The most important bodies working for anti-human trafficking in Finland include the Office of Immigration, Police, National Bureau of Investigation, The Finnish Border Guard, Ministry of Employment and the Economy along with multiple non-governmental organizations such as All Our Children Association, Amnesty International Finland Association, the Refugee Advice Centre and the Pro-support Centre. =Government= National action plan against trafficking in human beings was submitted to the Government on 24 March 2005, and the Government's response was obtained on 27 September during the same year. The plan covers multiple aspects of the phenomena, including those of providing help to the victims as well as improving the process of convicting suspected human traffickers. The plan also emphasizes raising the level of information available on trafficking as well as the awareness of human trafficking in Finland. Bettering the ability of professionals to recognize the victims of trafficking is also important. The Action Plan explicitly states that the concentrations of the plan are on human rights and on victim-centered approaches, and that the mutual cooperation of all authorities involved in human trafficking is crucial. The Ministry of Defense provided Finnish troops who were going to leave for international peacekeeping missions with intensive anti-trafficking training aimed at providing the forces with the ability to identify potential trafficking victims; there were no trafficking-related cases involving Finnish troops or government personnel deployed overseas in 2009. The government's efforts to monitor and scrutinize its anti-trafficking actions reflected a high level of political will to address human trafficking. Recently numerous Finnish political parties such as Vasemmistoliitto (Left Alliance), Vihre√§ Liitto (The Greens), Suomen Ruotsalainen Kansanpuolue and Suomen Kristillisdemokraatit (Christian Democrats) addressed the issue of human trafficking as well as gender equality in their manifestos for the parliamental election in 2015. The government cooperates with different NGOs and organizations in providing help for the victims of trafficking in Finland. In addition to domestic prevention of human trafficking, Finland does anti-human trafficking work on EU and international levels. For example, the Finnish government supported an anti-trafficking partnership with the Government of Nigeria by providing approximately $1.1 million toward Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency: Human trafficking was criminalized in Nigeria fairly recently, in 2003. A national operator NAPTIP (National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons) was then established to enforce the new anti-trafficking laws. In addition to criminal investigations, NAPTIP is also responsible for prosecution, the protection and rehabilitation of victims as well as for educating and informing the victims and the people. The government has also organized and hosted multiple seminars and conferences that addressed human trafficking and its prevention. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized a meeting concerning human trafficking in 2004 together with the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which is the principal institution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The following year Finland hosted NATO's anti-human trafficking seminar. =The National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health= The Ministry for Social Affairs and Health started a project in 1998 with goal of prevention of prostitution. This was a part of a five-year programme for \\"The prevention of violence against women and prostitution\\". The National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES) is the main organization executing the project. STAKES is subordinated to the ministry for Social Affairs and Health. The project is based on the 1997 Equality between the Genders Programme of the Finnish Government and therefore also on the action plan of the Beijing IV Women's Equality World Conference. STAKES has also done other research on prostitution, and this project is also utilized to continue that research. According to research conducted by Lehti and Aromaa, \\"The purpose of the project is to monitor prostitution at the national and international level, and to compile and produce information about the phenomena of commercial sex. Also, it provides expert support to authorities and also to other agencies, and disseminates information about prostitution and its prevention. The objective is to produce and support general research on prostitution, also to produce action proposals for the prevention of prostitution and the reduction of disadvantages and unacceptable circumstances related to this. Simultaneously, the project attempts to further co-operation between the authorities and civic organisations regarding this phenomenon.\\" See also * Human trafficking by country *Human rights in Finland * Debt bondage * Exploitation * Forced labour * Forced prostitution * List of organizations opposing human trafficking * Kidnapping * Migrant sex work * People smuggling * Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children * Serious and Organised Crime Group * Sexual exploitation * Trafficking of children * Transnational efforts to prevent human trafficking References Finland Finland Human rights abuses in Finland Crime in Finland by type Women's rights in Finland ","title":"Human trafficking in Finland"},{"id":"31516986","text":"Women, and children from Eastern Europe, West Africa, and Asia, as well as the Caribbean and Brazil, subjected to trafficking in persons, forced prostitution and forced labor. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. Women and children, many from Africa, continued to be subjected to forced domestic servitude. Often their ‚Äúemployers‚Äù are diplomats who enjoy diplomatic immunity from prosecution, including those from Saudi Arabia. Reportedly men from North Africa are subjected to forced labor in the agricultural and construction sectors in southern France. The Government of France estimates that the majority of the 18,000 women in France's commercial sex trade are likely forced into prostitution. It also estimates a significant number of children in France are victims of forced prostitution, primarily from Romania, West Africa, and North Africa. Romani and other unaccompanied minors in France continued to be vulnerable to forced begging. There were reportedly six French women subjected to forced prostitution in Luxembourg in 2009. Women and children from Brazil were subjected to forced labor and forced prostitution in the French overseas territory of French Guiana. There are also a number of young women in prostitution from Haiti, Suriname, and the Dominican Republic in French Guiana, some of whom may be vulnerable to trafficking. The French government investigated the existence of forced labor and forced prostitution occurring in gold mining sites in French Guiana in 2009, initiating 17 legal proceedings and arresting two trafficking offenders in French Guiana during the reporting period. The Government of France fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government continued to train prosecutors and judges to make better use of France's anti-trafficking law, continued to prosecute forced prostitution and forced labor offenders, and increased public-private partnerships to prevent trafficking. The government reported identifying a significant number of trafficking victims in 2009. While the government concluded that all identified victims were referred for care and assistance, it reported it did not officially collect or monitor this data in 2009.\\"France\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). Prosecution France prohibits trafficking for sexual exploitation through Article 225 of its penal code, which prescribes penalties that are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for rape. In January 2009, the government amended its anti-trafficking law to include a specific definition of forced labor. The government reported convicting 19 trafficking offenders under its anti- trafficking statute in 2008, the most recent year for which data was available, compared with 33 convicted trafficking offenders in 2007. The government did not provide an average sentence for these 19 traffickers, but reported the maximum sentence was up to seven years imprisonment. In addition, the government reported convicting an additional 26 trafficking offenders for the forced prostitution of children, with sentences up to seven years. French officials continued to rely largely on anti-pimping provisions of the country's penal code to prosecute suspected sex trafficking offenses. The government reported 523 prosecutions under its anti-pimping statute in 2008; approximately 16 percent of the original arrests were for trafficking-specific offenses. The Government of France successfully dismantled 40 trafficking rings in France in 2009 and cooperated to dismantle 14 international networks with bilateral partners through joint investigation teams aimed at investigating and prosecuting cases across borders. Protection The national government and city of Paris continued to partner with NGOs in order to provide trafficking victims with a network of services and shelters during the reporting period. The government provided some indirect funding for victims‚Äô care in 2009; however, it did not report overall funding allocations to NGOs for victims of trafficking. One NGO reported it received 20 percent of its budget from the government in 2009 but had to seek private funding in order to provide temporary housing for trafficking victims. Another NGO reported it worked with pro-bono medical and social service providers in order to assist victims of forced labor. A third NGO working with unaccompanied minors who are at risk of becoming victims of trafficking in France reported that it received 98 percent of its budget from the government in 2009. The government reported police and other authorities identified and referred 799 trafficking victims to NGOs for assistance in 2009; however, it reported that it did not officially collect or track data on the actual number or percentage of these identified victims that it referred for shelter and assistance. The NGO Committee Against Modern Slavery (CCEM) reported 216 cases of forced labor in France in 2008; 120 of these victims were reportedly placed in protective custody. The government increased its partnership with the Romanian government in order to improve the protection, return, and reintegration of Romani people unaccompanied minors. The French government provided witness protection services and issued one-year residency permits, which can be renewed every six months, to victims of trafficking who cooperated with authorities in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers; the government also provided identified victims with assistance and a 30-day reflection period to decide whether to cooperate with law enforcement. A trafficking victim may receive a permanent residency card though only if the defendant is successfully convicted by the government. The government did not report the number of victims that received residence permits or cards in 2009. One NGO continued to express frustration with the fees required for the residency permit and renewal of the permit. NGOs continued to provide monthly stipends to trafficking victims, with some of these stipends provided by the government. The government formally assists trafficking victims seeking return to their countries of origin, though fewer than five percent usually decide to do so. Although the border police reportedly used indicator cards to proactively identify victims, French border police do not have any systematic procedures in place to identify trafficking victims, according to a 2009 report by Human Rights Watch. Some local observers continued to criticize the government's lack of a proactive approach to identifying trafficking victims and reported that some women in prostitution are arrested and fined for solicitation without being screened to determine if they are trafficking victims. To address this deficiency, the government reported it continued to provide mandatory training to all law enforcement personnel to increase their identification and awareness of potential trafficking victims in 2009. A 2009 Human Rights Watch Report cited the French government for alleged abusive police treatment and the forced removal of unaccompanied minors from Roissy Charles de Gaulle Airport. The report described French authorities‚Äô policy of detaining unaccompanied minors, including potential trafficking victims, in a designated ‚Äútransit zone‚Äù at the airport. French authorities failed to screen these children for indications of trafficking, treating them as irregular migrants, which resulted in their deportation and which could make them vulnerable to re-trafficking or persecution in their home countries. The report documented two cases in which the government failed to adequately identify two children from Nigeria and Guinea as trafficking victims, in one case the victim's trafficker visited her in detention to collect money. Reportedly, the French Red Cross regularly alerts French authorities about the need to improve the response to children who appear to be trafficking victims. Prevention The Government of France sustained strong prevention efforts in 2009 and led European efforts to prevent human trafficking on the Internet. Its multi-disciplinary group met throughout 2009 to improve national coordination and ensure a victim-centered approach. The government launched a national campaign in 2010 combating violence against women in all forms; the campaign highlighted trafficking in persons as part of this broader campaign. In January 2010, the government sponsored a nationwide conference that brought together law enforcement, magistrates, and NGOs to improve partnerships in order to better protect victims and prevent trafficking. The government, in partnership with the hotel industry, provided training for managers and employees of major hotel groups on identification techniques for potential victims of trafficking and how to report potential trafficking. As a law enforcement activity that could serve to prevent human trafficking, the government reported convicting 149 offenders for ‚Äúcrimes related to modern day slavery,‚Äù including 117 convictions for ‚Äúsubjecting vulnerable individuals to indecent accommodations and working conditions‚Äù and 32 convictions for ‚Äúwithholding wages of vulnerable individuals.‚Äù In October 2009, the government announced the creation of a public-private partnership to address child sports trafficking and committed $2.74 million towards the initiative. In 2009, ECPAT France launched a progressive public awareness campaign in cooperation with Air France, over which the government exercises considerable influence, to target French child sex tourists; the campaign stressed the legal consequences of such sexual exploitation crimes committed abroad and the government's commitment to prosecute these crimes in French courts, imposing strong prison sentences for convicted offenders. The government did not conduct or fund any demand-reduction awareness campaigns aimed at raising awareness among potential clients of victims in France. The government provided all French military and law enforcement personnel with general training on trafficking during their basic training. There was also a three-week general training given to French military personnel before their deployment abroad for international peacekeeping missions. In March 2009, the government convicted two French nationals for aggravated sex tourism offenses they committed in Southeast Asia; both received the maximum sentences of seven years. In September 2009, French Police dismantled a makeshift camp for undocumented migrants near the port of Calais, known colloquially as ‚Äúthe jungle,‚Äù and rounded up almost 300 Afghans, Pakistanis, and others who had hoped to cross the English Channel into Great Britain. Although media reports indicated that French officials hailed the demolition as a prevention measure for trafficking, it is unclear as to whether the action was explicitly intended to be an anti-trafficking measure. Local observers and international experts criticized the government's response, citing it increased these migrants' vulnerability to trafficking.

Using a lower cost Ford Model T engine, rather than the more current Ford Model A engine of the time. The aircraft was redesigned for the heavier, lower power engine by reducing it to a single person aircraft. The new pilot location required a section called a \\"flop\\" to be installed, essentially a section of the wing that was hinged up to allow the pilot to stand up when getting into and out of the aircraft. The aircraft was designed to be built of spruce and plywood. The drawings were published in the 1933 Mechanix Illustrated magazine.

The Maltese original, Bonaparti f'Malta, was published in 1997. Citing contemporary documents from Malta's archives, it provides a detailed account of the six days Napoleon Bonaparte spent in Malta in 1798, as well as an analysis of the political situation under the Order of St John of Jerusalem and the political and cultural consequences of Bonaparte's conquest of Malta. In the words of fellow writer and former Prime Minister of Malta, Alfred Sant, Napoleon and his impact on Malta were \\"enduring subjects of [Sammut's] interests and research\\".Sant, Alfred (4 May 2011). \\"Frans Sammut: A Man of Courage\\", maltastar.com It is the first account in the French language of those six days.

Sammut maintained that Napoleon, despite spending such a short time in Malta, sought singlehandedly to draw the country into the modern world. He issued a series of decrees aimed at bringing about a thorough reorganization of government and society in Malta, and tirelessly sought to review the country's laws and regulations. The abolition of noble titles and privileges and the ending of slavery were the first measures he implemented. He ordered the expulsion of the Inquisitor and the release of the Order's political prisoners, including the Maltese patriot, Mikiel Anton Vassalli, who shared his Enlightenment ideals and whom he described as \\"the most intelligent prisoner (ever) locked in a cell\\".Grech, Scott (13 July 2010). \\"Napoleon Bonaparte: The first to instigate a divorce debate in Malta\\" , The Malta IndependentGrech, Scott (26 July 2010). \\"Interview with Frans Sammut\\" , The Malta Independent Voicing his surprise that fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics and astronomy were not yet being taught at the University of Malta, he also instituted a series of educational reforms. Sammut characterized Napoleon as \\"a different kind of leader... more of an intellectual strategist and philosopher\\", a quality placing him in the highest rank of commander together with Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great. Some of Sammut's research for Bonaparte √† Malte also went into his 1994 historical novel about Vassalli, Il-ƒ¶olma Maltija (The Maltese Dream), described by Alfred Sant as \\"his masterpiece\\" and by British author and poet Marjorie Boulton as \\"a colossal work\\".Maltese works in Esperanto, The Malta Independent, 2 September 2007 According to Prof. Anne-Marie M√©sa of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Frans Sammut's \\"point of view is actually original, well reasoned out, nuanced and subtle ‚Äì as one would expect from all works on history.

He also wrote a number of hymns including Our God, to Whom we turn. He would later play a major role in the No-Conscription Fellowship, an organization that united and supported conscientious objectors in Britain during World War One. Early career Grubb was born in Sudbury, Suffolk, educated at Bootham School,Oxford Dictionary of National Biography York and studied at the University of Leeds and University of London. He began his career as a teacher when he returned to Bootham School in York, England. Bootham is a boarding school for boys of the Religious Society of Friends. Grubb had attended the school himself, beginning in 1868 at the age of fourteen. He would later move on to teach at a number of other schools, including other Quaker schools. He received his B.A. in 1876 and in 1877 married Emma M. Horsnail of Bulford Mill, who he had courted for seven years. Struggles with Faith and Science While preparing for his M.A. examination in 1879, he had a crisis of faith resulting from his inability to reconcile science with the religious beliefs he had grown up with. He initially found it impossible to see how any serious intellectual could also be religious. He did not find any satisfaction in agnosticism; however, and remained open to a solution to his intellectual problems that included belief in God. In the 1880s Grubb began to develop an interest in social concerns, even cutting back on his teaching in order to devote time to the study of economics and to public work. In keeping with his desire to reconcile faith with science, Grubb was among those who vocally and successfully opposed the adoption of the Richmond Declaration by London Yearly Meeting in 1888. Soon after, as a result of his regular participation in meeting for worship, Grubb was officially recorded as a minister in the Religious Society of Friends. At the time, he still did not feel he had a firm basis for his faith, but was confident that it would come with time. Major Contributions Grubb would go on to be a major leader of British Quakerism, a prolific religious author, and a key member of a number of religious and social organizations, including the No-Conscription Fellowship. Like most pacifists of his generation, his absolute pacifist stance was born from the disillusionment with the Boer War. From 1901 to 1906 he was secretary of the Howard Association. Death and final resting place The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography records that Grubb was buried on 26 January 1939 at the Hitchin Quaker burial ground. However, the Hertford & Hitchin Monthly Meeting minutes of 4 February 1939 state quite clearly: \\"He was cremated at Golders Green 27th 1. 39., the death having been registered at Letchworth 25th 1st mo. 1939\\".

It has been attributed to the noted New York architect Richard Upjohn. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 for having local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated as a superlative example of Carpenter Gothic design from the mid-19th century. Description As originally constructed in 1871, Trinity Episcopal Church consisted of the nave and chancel, plus a transept and vestry on the north. Immediately to the east was a freestanding church hall used for the parish school. Both buildings were constructed at the same time, along with a rectory a block and a half to the west. The gap between the church and hall was later filled in, creating a single structure. The three-story bell tower and south transept are also later additions. The building's board and batten walls were a signature of Episcopal churches from the 1850s to the 1870s. On the Trinity Episcopal Church, though, the exterior walls are highly embellished with wainscoting below a horizontal band at the height of the window sills. Directly below each window is a decorative panel of crossed boards. These elements are not found on the parish hall, indicating it was not designed by the same architect. The church's lancet windows and door and side-entry bell tower are typical of Carpenter Gothic architecture. The church's original pine furnishings were replaced in the 1950s. However very similar furnishings can be seen in the contemporaneous St. Mark's Episcopal Chapel near Annandale, Minnesota. Architect Historical documents do not record who the architect was for the church building. It is believed to have been designed by prominent architect Richard Upjohn of New York City, famous for his Gothic Revival churches. Upjohn had a plausible connection to the project, given that the construction funds were largely donated by Upjohn's famous Trinity Church in Manhattan and he had designed the Brooklyn home of the family after whom Litchfield was named. The building's grace and sophistication indicate that Trinity Episcopal Church was indeed one of Upjohn's last works. Additionally, the original rectory resembles the architect's own home in Garrison, New York, though perhaps coincidentally. Current use Trinity Episcopal Church is still an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota. As of 2015 its rector is the Reverend Robert Miller. The original rectory a short distance away has since become a private residence.

Zichal is the former Deputy Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, serving in the Barack Obama administration starting in 2009. Following the early 2011 departure of Carol Browner from the administration, Zichal gained the general responsibility of coordinating the administration's energy and climate policy and was an architect of what became the administration's politically controversial Clean Power Plan. Zichal previously served as a legislative director and campaign advisor to several Democratic Party congressional members. In November 2013 she left the administration and became a private consultant and a fellow at the Atlantic Council. She has served on several company boards and councils and was The Nature Conservancy's vice president for corporate engagement from 2018-2019. Early life and education Zichal grew up in Elkader, Iowa, with parents Ken (a family physician) and Fran (CEO of Central Community Hospital) and a younger brother Ernie. She graduated from Central Elkader High School in 1994. She attended Cook College at Rutgers University, where she studied environmental policy and graduated in 1999. Legislative assistant and campaign advisor While at Rutgers she had interned at the state chapter of the Sierra Club and was part of a panel interviewing candidates for U.S. House of Representatives in New Jersey's 12th congressional district. The support of environmentalists helped Democrat Rush D. Holt, Jr. stage an upset victory over Republican incumbent Michael J. Pappas. Holt hired Zichal and she went to Washington, D.C., where she served as a legislative director for him. She held the same position for Representative Frank Pallone from 2001 to 2002. She then was a legislative assistant and later director for U.S. Senator John Kerry from 2002 to 2008. She also worked as an assistant for the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. In these positions she worked on legislation to address climate change, reduce the country's dependence on oil for energy, and to protect American natural resources. Zichal also served as a top advisor on energy and environmental issues to the 2004 Kerry presidential campaign and the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. She had first met Obama when he was lost in one of the Senate buildings and asked her for directions. Deputy Assistant in Obama administration Zichal reviewing the location of the Arctic ice field during an Arctic Domain Awareness flight in 2009 After serving on the Obama-Biden Transition Project in its Energy and Environment Policy Working Group, she was named to be Deputy Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change in December 2008, to serve as deputy to Carol Browner, who was named director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy (as such, Browner's position was also informally referred to as the \\"Climate Czar\\" or \\"Energy Czar\\"). Zichal took office in January 2009. She was part of the administration response to the 2010 BP oil spill and supervised later modifications of safety standards for offshore oil and natural gas extraction. Zichal participating in an online question-and- answer session during 2010 When Browner left the White House in March 2011, Zichal took over the general responsibilities of coordinating the administration's energy and climate policy, now operating from within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council (the \\"czar\\" position itself having been reorganized away by the White House and its funding subsequently abolished by Congress in the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown). As such she became one of the White House staff members tasked with implementation of the Presidential Climate Action Plan. Her job also involved outreach activities towards the energy industry and environmentalists as well as dealing with Congress. With Republicans having taken over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of the large-scale climate and energy legislation passing that Browner had worked towards were essentially nil. At first the administration pursued more modest goals that could attract bipartisan support, such as reducing oil imports and promoting clean or renewable energy sources. The White House subsequently gave credit to Zichal for putting into place policy changes that would lead to a doubling of wind and solar power generation. Zichal at a microphone in 2011 During the early portion of Obama's second term, Zichal was one of the public faces of the administration's approach of addressing climate change via federal regulatory action. She was the architect of a June 2013 plan to reduce greenhouse gases resulting from the nation's power plants by having the Environmental Protection Agency issue revised standards for carbon emissions from new and existing plants. They were the first ever such restrictions. (This plan eventually became known as the Clean Power Plan when issued in revised form in 2015; Zichal was still considered one of its architects. It became politically controversial during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, with opponents deriding it as the \\"War on Coal\\". Its implementation was blocked while challenges to it were made in U.S. federal courts.) Zichal speaking at a White House Leadership Summit on Women, Climate and Energy in 2013 A 2013 profile from National Journal described her as having \\"developed a reputation among players across the energy spectrum as a smart, pragmatic, and serious player.\\" A Democratic political operative and energy industry lobbyist called Zichal a \\"skilled communicator and negotiator\\" and said she was \\"dogged in her pursuit of gaining consensus with external stakeholders and delivering on a clean energy agenda for this administration.\\" However, former Vice President and ardent environmentalist Al Gore complained in mid-2013 that the administration was not giving climate change sufficient priority, and making reference to Zichal said, \\"He does not yet have a team in the White House to help him implement solutions to the climate crisis. He hasn't staffed up for it ... he's got one person who hasn't been given that much authority.\\" In October 2013, Zichal announced that she would soon be stepping down from her post. She was given the chance to accept other positions within the administration, but declined. She was one of the last of Obama's 2008 campaign advisors to still be in the administration; she had been high valued inside the administration and by one report Obama had personally urged her to stay. Her last day was November 8, 2013, and she was succeeded by Dan Utech. Consultant and board member Zichal subsequently became an independent energy consultant, working at her own firm called Zichal Inc. In January 2015 she was named a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. There she is part of the council's Global Energy Center. She served on the board of Cheniere Energy, a liquified natural gas company, from 2014 to 2018, as well as the board of Spanish multinational-owned Abengoa Bioenergy. In addition she is an operating advisor at Broadscale, an energy-focused investing firm, and a senior advisor at an enterprise called Sensity. She joined the board of non- profit The Solar Foundation as well as Naturevest, the conservation investing unit of The Nature Conservancy, and in 2018 became the Nature Conservancy's Vice President for corporate engagement. She remained active in the public debate over climate change and energy policy. During the Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016, she spoke out with evident support for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016 over the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016. In 2019, she became an advisor to the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign, helping him craft a \\"middle ground\\" climate and energy policy, in contrast to the Green New Deal that a number of Democratic candidates and other party figures were in favor of. Zichal said of those backing the Green New Deal, \\"I respect where they are coming from. What we learned from the Obama administration is unless we find middle ground on these issues, we risk not having any policies. ... [Biden will] build a new climate coalition. Unions and environmentalists are searching for common ground. We can't drive a common agenda unless we work together.\\" In reaction to those who said that Biden's plan was too cautious, she said that the former vice president would \\"enact a bold policy to tackle climate change in a meaningful and lasting way. ... Any suggestion that it wouldn't is in direct contradiction to his long record of understanding climate change as an existential threat.\\" Updated May 12, 2019.

He is best known for his rearguard defense in the Burmese-Siamese War (1759‚Äì1760) in Siam as the Burmese forces rushed back a dying Alaungpaya back home. The general, who was well respected by the troops, then rebelled against Alaungpaya's successor Naungdawgyi. He believed he would be executed by the new king with whom he had a long history of enmity. The rebel general seized Ava in June 1760, and withstood the siege for over five months. He was killed by a musket shot as he fled the city in December. A remorseful Naungdawgyi was said to have mourned at the news of the death of his adversary and his father's brother in arms. Early life The future general was born Maung Ton ( ) in a small Upper Burma village of Moksobo (present-day Shwebo). He was a childhood friend of Aung Zeya who was a son of chief of Moksobo. Military service In 1752, Ton responded to his friend and village chief Aung Zeya's call to resist the occupation armies of the southern kingdom of Hanthawaddy, which had toppled the Toungoo Dynasty at Ava (Inwa). Aung Zeya claimed himself king, and assumed the title of Alaungpaya. Ton went on to fight in all of Alaungpaya's campaigns, winning many titles for valor in the process. He led one of the Burmese armies in the 1758 Manipuri campaign that made Manipur a tributary state of Burma. =Siam= Minkhaung Nawrahta was one of the lead commanders in Alaungpaya's invasion of Siam in 1759. He led one of the three armies that converged on the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya in April 1760. The Burmese were on the brink of victory when Alaungpaya suddenly fell ill from scrofula. Alaungpaya personally selected his childhood friend to command the rearguard, which were \\"the pick of the army--500 Manipuri Horse and 6,000 foot, everyman of whom had a musket\\". Minkhaung Nawrahta spread them out and it was two days before the Siamese realized that the main Burmese army had left. The Siamese then broke out of the walls of Ayutthaya. His men watched the ring closing round them, and fearing to be cut off, begged him to let them fight further back. But he said \\"Friends, the safety of our Lord the King lies in our keeping. Let us not fight further back lest the sounds of guns break his further sleep.\\" With his leadership, the Burmese forces withdrew in good order, collecting army stragglers along the way. Rebellion Alaungpaya died on 11 May 1760, and his son Naungdawgyi succeeded him. Alaungpaya's second son Hsinbyushin had tried to take over the throne but failed. Naungdawgyi pardoned his younger brother at the queen mother's intercession. But the king was suspicious of other revolts. He sent for two of the generals he disliked. When they came unsuspectingly, he executed them without allowing them to see him. The army was furious.Harvey, p. 244 Minkhaung Nawrahta too was concerned because of the old enmity between him and Naungdawgyi. He deliberately slowed down his rearguard back to Shwebo. Naungdawgyi then ordered his arrest. Although he had not been involved in Hsinbyushin's conspiracy, Minkhaung Nawrahta felt sure that he would be stripped of his command, and probably executed on some excuse. He decided to rebel even though he had no definite plan of rebellion. It was more a gesture of defiance. He had been a simple villager in 1752, and he had fought in all the campaigns, shoulder to shoulder with Alaungpaya. He looked back on those eventful years, the victories that had come his way, and the titles and the honors that had been showered upon him by his grateful master. He said to his followers: :\\"I was a common villager when I drew my sword and said to my lord: \\"My friend, my comrade, the Mons are winning everywhere and thou must defeat them. With this sword, I shall make thee king or die in the attempt.\\" But those days are gone, and my gracious master, who alone could help me in this crisis, is no more. This is no time for regret or fear, and I must strike, come what may.\\" His army occupied Ava on 25 June 1760. His garrison repelled all attacks by the king's army but by December, the city was starving. Seeing that the surrender was inevitable, the rebel general and a band of devoted followers fled the city. More than once, the pursuers surrounded him. But he still commanded such respect among the troops that the pursuers fell back in awe when he strode through them. In the Shan hills above Kyaukse, he was brought down by a musket shot. Even then, he overpowered the assailant who grappled with him, and had to be finished with a second shot. Such was the end of Alaungpaya's brother in arms.Harvey, pp. 246-247 Minkhaung Nawrahta was respected even by his adversary, Naungdawgyi. When Minkhaung Nawrahta's dead body was brought before him, the king was remorseful, saying \\"Should ye have slain so great a man?\\" References Konbaung dynasty Burmese generals 1710s births 1760 deaths ","title":"Minkhaung Nawrahta"},{"id":"31517202","text":"Jeremiah (, Yeremia) was a 10th-century Bulgarian priest and writer usually associated with the origins of Bogomilism.Dimitri Obolensky The Bogomils: A Study in Balkan Neo-Manichaeism p271 - 2004 \\"APPENDIX II THE POP JEREMIAH The Bulgarian priest (pop) Jeremiah is frequently associated in historical sources with the pop Bogomil.

The introduction of American \\"miracle foods\\" was instrumental in pulling the Iberian population out of the famine and hunger that was common in the 16th century.Super, John C.. Food, Conquest, and Colonization in Sixteenth-Century Spanish America. University of New Mexico Press, 1994. Maize (corn), potatoes, turkey, squash, beans, and tomatoes were all incorporated into existing Spanish and Portuguese cuisine styles. Equally important was the impact of coffee and sugar cane growing in the New World (despite having already existed in the Old World). Along with the impact from food, the introduction of new goods (such as tobacco) also altered how Iberian society worked. One can categorize the impacts of these New World goods and foods based on their influence over the state, the economy, religious institutions, and the culture of the time. The power and influence of the state grew as external entities (i.e. other European nations) became dependent on Spain for these New Goods in the early 16th century. The economies of both Portugal and Spain saw an enormous increase in power as a result of trading these American goods. New World native plants. Clockwise, from top left: 1. Maize (Zea mays) 2. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) 3. Potato (Solanum tuberosum) 4. Vanilla (Vanilla) 5. Par√° rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) 6. Cacao (Theobroma cacao) 7. Tobacco (Nicotiana rustica) Luxury goods and foods Several of the goods and foods brought to the Old World appealed to the lavish tastes of the upper classes. The difficulties involved in gaining this goods led them to go for higher prices and their elite status amongst the rich. =Cocoa= \\"Trait√©s nouveaux & curieux du caf√© du th√© et du chocolate\\", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685. Chocolate was by far one of the most influential of the New World goods on Spanish, and later European, society. By the 1590s, chocolate had a significant presence in the Iberian Peninsula. The growing chocolate habit in Spain led to a cross-cultural transmission of tastes (such as vanilla, pepper, the color red, and a foamy froth similar to that found in chocolate). The taste for chocolate diffused in a bottom-up fashion as colonists and conquistadors encountered new native tastes. Spaniards in the Americas who initially encountered the chocolate liquid had mixed reactions, but a love for the new taste quickly spread into the Iberian Peninsula itself. The method in which chocolate's popularity spread changed by the time it had reached the peninsula. Cacao was necessary for chocolate, but it also served as a currency throughout Mesoamerica, which is evidence of its status as a precious good throughout the region. If a commoner were to drink it, it would be seen almost as bad as saying a bad prayer or omen. Chocolate began to form a relationship with the people it would be found at weddings or betrothals. The upper class in Spain would embrace this chocolate craving to the point where the lower classes sought to emulate them. For natives, chocolate was filled with religious meaning while it played the role of a drug for the Spanish. The distinction between how the two societies perceived the role of chocolate's use is interesting. Natives saw this liquid through the lens of religious meaning while the Spanish saw the economic and culinary benefits. By the 1620s, thousands of pounds of chocolate were imported to Spain annually. The components of European chocolate evolved over time as the Spanish sought to modify the formula to reflect available resources (such as adding sugar as a sweetener rather than honey). Chocolate started a lavish item in the diets of the Spanish nobility but eventually became an accessible commodity for all members of Spanish society. While the initial interest in chocolate for the Spanish was hampered by negative stigmas (i.e. that chocolate drinking was a form of idolatry), chocolate went on to become one of the most desired and influential goods from the New World.Norton, Marcy. \\"Tasting Empire: Chocolate and the European Internalization of Mesoamerican Aesthetics.\\" American Historical Review, 2006: 660-691. =Sugar= While initially a crop of the Indian subcontinent, the cultivation of sugar in the New World had significant effects on Spanish society. New World sugar cultivation added to the growing power of the Spanish and Portuguese economies while also increasing the popularity of slave labor (which had severe impacts on African, American, and European societies). Sugar started off as a mark of social statues amongst the upper classes but gradually trickled down towards the lower classes. This desire for sugar reflected social reasons other than simply a biologically pleasing taste for the tongue. Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu argues that subjective pleasures, such as a taste for sugar, reflect social constructs and often are determined by those in power.Bourdieu, Piere. Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste. Cambridge, 1984. Bourdeieu's argument certainly suggests that the popularity of sugar in Iberian society was a result of the perceived value placed on it by the upper classes whom held power. =Coffee= Close-up of roasted coffee beans While initially an Ethiopian product, the cultivation of coffee in the New World increased its popularity amongst the European population substantially. The cultivation and spread of coffee into Europe was started in the 15th century in the Arab world. The assimilation of chocolate into Spanish tastes paved the way for coffee as the new hot stimulant drink to gain popularity in Spain. Coffee imports even surpassed those of chocolate by the 18th century. The desire for coffee, like that of chocolate, eventually spread to include all castes in Iberia. Coffee, along with chocolate and sugar, stimulated a growing taste for New World sweet goods. =Tobacco= The earliest image of a man smoking, from Tabaco by Anthony Chute. As we know more now than ever, tobacco had very addictive qualities. The insidious addictiveness of tobacco led to an increasingly prominent demand for the good in New World trade.Crosby, Alfred. The Columbian Exchange: The Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492. Westport, 1972. The plant was initially smoked by native tribes in the Americas for ceremonial purposes. It was believed to be a gift from the gods and was used primarily by religious leaders. The Spanish changed this dynamic of the crop when they began trading tobacco as a commodity. The demand for tobacco stimulated the Spanish and Portuguese trade networks as well as increased Iberian power in world trade. The tobacco trade dominated the economies of the south-eastern US up until the peak of cotton's popularity in world trade. =Vanilla= Vanilla, a flavoring derived from the orchids of the genus Vanilla, was first brought to Spain in the 1520s by Cortez following his conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Aztecs had started cultivating the plant following their subjugation of the Totonec peoples of present-day Mexico. Vanilla quickly became popular as a sweetener in Spain and then the rest of Europe. Along with coffee and chocolate, sugar started a desire for sweet tastes from the New World. The crop eventually spread down to the rest of European society and has become and incredible common good in European society. One could even argue sugar had reached the status of a staple for Iberian and, in a broader sense, European society. Staples Several foods that came from the New World rapidly became staples in Europe. Examples of European dependence on Mesoamerican foods can be found in Ireland with the potato and in Italy with the tomato. =Maize= Variegated maize ears Columbus encountered and noted the cultivation of maize on all of his voyages.Andrews, Jean. \\"Diffusion of Mesoamerican Food Complex in Southeastern Europe.\\" Geographical Review: Apri93, Vol. 83 Issue 2, p194, 11p, 1993: 194-205. The Aztecs and Mayans of Central America had long cultivated several forms of the crop before its introduction into Europe. Traders and merchants brought corn back to Europe in the 16th century where, due to its ability to grow in diverse regions, the crop spread rapidly in popularity. Maize became a pivotal crop in the Turkish Empire and the Balkans by the mid 16th century. Maize became a necessity for the growing Ottoman armies and was noted for its productive harvests. The fact that corn had reached the Ottoman Empire by the mid-16th century certainly suggests it was a prevalent crop in both Spain and Portugal at the time. =Squash= The native populations of the Americas had long relied on squash, along with corn and beans, as prime staples for their peoples. The Spanish who brought this crop back to Europe found similar practical use in the crop and adopted it as a staple. Squash was known in the Turkish Empire by 1539. This could have possibly been the result of goods brought from expelled Spanish Jews and Muslims. If this is true, then it raises an interesting question about how the expulsion of Jews and Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula altered the rest of the Old World. Jews and Muslims leaving the peninsula would bring with them goods, customs, and traditions from Spain to their new homes. This certainly could have been the reason why squash had reached the Ottomans in the early 16th century. =Beans= While beans have long been around in Europe and Asia. Common, lima, and sieva beans are a few of the new types of beans that were introduced to Europe following Columbus's initial voyages. Natives had long recognized the protein-rich benefits of beans. The Spanish were quick to adopt the new beans into their diets. =Tomatoes= Tomatoes had long been popular in South America where the native peoples of Peru grew and traded them. Cortez's conquests in the 16th century resulted in the crops introduction into Spain and then Europe. The crop grew well in Mediterranean soils and quickly grew in popularity. The first discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692. Culinary historian Alan Davidson argues that the tomato and potato were initially treated with suspicion due to their similarity to the poisonous belladonna plant.Davidson, Alan. \\"Europeans' Wary Encounter with Potatoes, Tomatoes, and Other New World Foods.\\" In Chilies to Chocolate: Food the Americas Gave the World, by Nelson and Cordell, Linda S. Foster, 3. Tucson, 1992. This explains why Spanish society was initially slow to incorporate the tomato into their diet (relative to the initial popularity of other foods, such as chocolate and maize). =Turkey= Spaniards had encountered domesticated turkeys in Panama in 1502. These turkeys were part of a pre- existing land trade route throughout Central and South America carried out by various native peoples. The Spanish then brought the turkey back to Spain where it became a popular new type of meat eaten by the masses. =New peppers= Columbus had recorded at least two new types of peppers following his first voyage. Spain, following Columbus's initial encounter, gradually incorporate these new peppers into their diets and spread them throughout Europe. The spread of peppers in the Old World was dependent on pre-existing trade networks through Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Near East. The Portuguese and Ottomans were more influential in the diffusion of the Mesoamerican food complex across Europe than the Spanish (who introduced the crops in the first place). By 1543, the first European illustrations of peppers were published in a German herbal. Peppers from the New World began to replace the pre-existing peppers from Africa and Asia. =Potato= Russet potatoes with sprouts The tuberous crop known as the potato originated in the southern region of Peru. The potato served as the principal staple crop for the Inca Empire and was met with similar popularity in the Spanish Empire. Spanish armies and workers adopted the crop as a staple because of the relative ease associated with its production. Peasants also adopted the crop as the 16th century progressed. The potato continued to spread rapidly throughout Europe where, by the 19th century, it had replaced the turnip and rutabaga as the principal food staples.von Bremzen, p. 322 Other influential goods The influence of goods and foods from the Americas spread into other aspects of Iberian life aside from playing lavish and staple roles. =Cotton= Cotton was originally cultivated by the inhabitants of the Indus Valley. While Europe had contact with the crop before the discovery of the New World, its use and popularity increased dramatically following the incorporation of cotton plantations on newly quired American lands. Columbus encountered woven cotton fabrics in Nicaragua and Honduras during his fourth voyages. While cotton's spread into Europe was gradual, it came to revolutionize fabric production in the Old World. This crop, along with many others in the Americas, led to an increasing demand for slave labor. Cotton would reach the peak of its cultivation during the Industrial Revolution in Europe. =Rubber= Rubber was originally cultivated by the Olmec people of Mesoamerica. This was usually done by draining the sap from rubber trees. Rubber did not have an early noticeable impact on the Iberian people. The fact that the Par√° rubber tree initially only grew in the Amazon Rainforest. It would not be until the 19th century that the tree was able to be grown in a non-Brazilian area. =Flow of knowledge= While not necessarily a good, the flow of knowledge from the New World that came with the introduction of new foods had an enormous influence on Iberian and European society. The knowledge on how to cultivate new foods was essential in the early spread of Mesoamerican goods into Iberian society. It is reasonable to assume that the influx of knowledge added new professions to Iberian society while changing the way pre-existing professions operated, especially in regards to agriculture. Non-social consequences The influx of new goods and foods into 16th-century Spain and Portugal had significant effects on other aspects of Iberian history besides merely the society. =Economic impact= Spanish Currency Spain and Portugal, having been the first two European nations to begin trading New World goods, developed impressive economies as a result of their control over the trade of American goods and foods in the early 16th century. Cravings for New World stimulants such as coffee and sugar may have motivated people to work harder to obtain money to supply these new habits. Along with this, the accessory implements that were necessary for many of these new goods (such as tobaccos and coffee) led to a new professions aimed at manufacturing clay pipes, snuffboxes, porcelain chocolate pots etc. The Spanish and Portuguese capitalized upon every opportunity to extract revenue back to their empires; utilizing forced labor. When the Pope banned the use of forced labor by the natives, Spanish and Portuguese entrepreneurs turned to the African Slavery. The demand for New World goods, such as chocolate, led to an enormous growth in the transatlantic slave trade during the 16th and 17th centuries. The slave trade had devastating effects on the societies of several African nations. The Spanish crown applied the tactic of extraction to keep cost at ultimate low, which led to political corruption in their colonies and back at home. Patch summarizes it as, ‚Äúan entire commercial system based on government official came into existence.‚ÄùPatch, Robert W. \\"Imperial politics and local economy in colonial Central America 1670 1770.\\" Past & Present no. 143 (May 1994): 77. Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost (accessed March 21, 2016). Spain extractive method of its colonies would soon be problematic and outdated, as new global players would become involved in the Americas. The Spanish colonial system and economic dependency for raw materials would hinder Spain‚Äôs commercial markets. Spain would place less emphasis on their colonies in North America due to its lack of mineral wealth and would use them to as buffers to protect ports and other colonies further south. Weber highlights the flaw when stating, ‚ÄúThe economic malaise that affected Spain‚Äôs North American colonies reflected the weakness of the Spanish economy itself, built traditionally on the exportation of raw materials and the importation of manufactured goods.‚ÄùDalton, Heather. \\"Port Cities Of Atlantic Iberia, C. 1500-1900.\\" Sixteenth Century Journal 41.2 (2010): 491-492. Academic Search Premier. Web. 14 Mar. 2016. Spanish economy back at home, spiraling with inflation, would become dependent upon foreign imports and manufactured goods. The significant amount of silver brought back to Spain and Portugal created inflation in Europe. For Spain, the period is referred to as Spanish price revolution. the Spanish inflation had raised domestic manufactures and made them uncompetitive. Spain‚Äôs colonial agenda of extraction would lead to its inability to supply its colonies and subjects at home. Weber builds upon the Spanish inability to capitalize commercial markets when stating, ‚ÄúThe cost of transportation plus profits for numerous middlemen and additional internal custom duties (alcabalas) along the way drove the price of some items to many time their Verecruz or Mexico City value by the time they reached the frontier.‚ÄùWeber, David J. Spanish Frontier in North America. New Haven, CT, USA: Yale University Press, 2009. Accessed March 21, 2016. ProQuest ebrary. The crown‚Äôs inability to establish efficient trading route and placement of high tariffs would discourage merchants and traders from legitimate business practices. Spain‚Äôs colonies in the Americas would soon suffer as merchants and traders would turn to other forms of trade. Weber summarizes it when stating, ‚ÄúFor suppliers and consumers alike, such artificially high prices made smuggling so attractive that perhaps two-thirds of all commerce throughout the Spanish empire consisted of illegal trade, much of it with foreigner‚Ä¶ it increased as English and French merchants grew more numerous and proximate.‚Äù =Religious impact= The abundance of meat in Spanish America led to the use of animal fats over olive oil in cooking. Pope Pius III, in recognition of the meat basis for their diet, granted a thirty- year exemption from fasting for the colonists. This led to a further reliance on meat in the Spanish American diet and persisted to be a common occurrence in the cuisine following the thirty-year mark. Similarly, the Catholic restriction on meat on Fridays led to new innovations in cuisine using newly discovered American foodstuffs. =State impact= An anachronous map showing areas pertaining to the Spanish Empire at various times over a period exceeding 400 years. Despite the mutual trade exclusion that existed between Spain and Portugal in the early 16th century, Portuguese merchants still acquired goods from the Spanish. This led to a Portuguese dominance on the pepper trade within Europe. The Portuguese trade with the New World flourished despite the Treaty of Tordesillas due to illicit trade and Spanish permission to Portuguese merchants to bring African slaves and other trade goods into the colonies. This obvious disregard towards sanctions on trade didn't signify inherent disloyalty, but was a necessity for those whose livelihoods depended on such trade. The trade underground trade between Spain and Portugal was heightened by the African slave trade and became well established as mutually beneficial crops (such as maize, grains, squash, and beans were traded between the nations). Venice, Genoa, and Florence (among other Old World nations) depended on Iberians for New world goods in the early 16th century. If not for the incorporation of American \\"miracle foods\\", Europe may have not pulled out of its 16th-century cycles of hunger and starvation. The dependence on Spain and Portugal for New World goods perpetuated their colonization throughout the world. This, in turn, led to Spain and Portugal becoming the two leading world powers in the 16th and 17th centuries. The enormous wealth being extracted from the Americas and poured into the Spanish society would lead to corruption at home and in the colonies. Corruption and accumulation of vast resources at the top of the food chain had some ripple effects throughout the core countries. Corruption ran high from the top of the system, beginning from the crown in Spain and spread throughout the colonies. Royals, elites, government officials, and merchants grew significantly wealthy in a short period of time. Patch points out that, ‚ÄúState played a leading role in capital accumulation under colonialism. ‚ÄúCorruption‚Äù was therefore an integral and necessary part of the state system.‚Äù Government officials played a key role in the system in which they helped mobilize and invest capital, channeled the surplus away from the producers, and then split the profits with their merchant partners. Merchant status increased as corruption increased, playing a key role in spreading different commodities and ideas. One recorded instances of corruption occurred when the Crown needed revenue such as in times of war. The Sale of Magistracies began in the 1670s, when the government of the last Habsburg king, Charles II, introduced the measure in a desperate attempt to tap all possible sources of revenue. Technically not sold but a post was usually granted to worthy subject who had performed monetary service for the king. Corruption ran high as the sale of a post became more commonly sold then given away. =Cultural impact= By the late 1630s, it was increasingly common to find depictions of chocolate accouterments in still life paintings.

Biography Adolf of Schauenburg was born on January 19, 1511 and baptized on 3 February. He was the son of Jobst I, Count of Holstein- Schauenburg and his wife Maria of Nassau-Dillenburg. As a younger son, Adolf was groomed for a life in the church from a young age. From 1522 he studied at Leuven. He became a canon of Li√®ge Cathedral on September 2, 1528, and then provost of the cathedral on May 30, 1533. In 1529, he also became a canon of Mainz Cathedral and, on December 23, 1529, of Cologne Cathedral. He became dean of St. Gereon's Basilica, and then its provost in 1533. With his father's death in 1531, Adolf returned to Schaumburg to act as his younger brothers' guardian. He played a role in the governance of Schaumburg until 1544. In the early 1530s, the Archbishop of Cologne, Hermann of Wied, grew increasingly sympathetic to the Protestant Reformation. To try to curb the archbishop's influence, on December 17, 1533, the cathedral chapter of Cologne Cathedral elected Adolf to be the coadjutor bishop of Cologne. He was to be a conservative counterweight to Hermann's attempted reforms. On June 3, 1543, Pope Paul III wrote to Adolf encouraging him to be vigilant in his efforts against the archbishop. The pope excommunicated Hermann on July 3, 1546, naming Adolf the administrator of the archdiocese in his stead. The cathedral chapter elected Adolf as Archbishop of Cologne on January 24, 1547. He was ordained as a priest by Bishop Johann Nopel on May 3, 1547. Adolf's first task was to roll back the reforms initiated by his predecessor. Hermann had installed Martin Bucer, but Adolf now banned Protestant preaching throughout the archdiocese. Accompanied by Eberhard Billick, provincial superior of the Carmelites, Adolf attended the Diet of Augsburg in 1547‚Äì48. He was ordained a bishop on April 8, 1548, in the presence of Pope Paul III and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. He attended the 1551 session of the Council of Trent, accompanied by Billick and Johann Gropper. Adolf died in Br√ºhl on September 20, 1556. Cornelis Floris de Vriendt created matching tombs for Adolf and his younger brother Anton of Schauenburg (d. 1558) in Cologne Cathedral. Originally located in the choir, they were relocated to the radiating chapels in 1863.

The programme was well received by critics. It was also presented as a part to the World Autism Awareness Day at the United Nations. Plot Ayellet (Alma Zack) makes good money as the village tailor, and when her father, Meir (Yehuda Barkan), turns to agricultural politics, her husband, Yaniv, turns the family farm into a profitable business exporting yellow peppers. Both men help her raise Natty, her teenage daughter from a former marriage, and Omri, her toddler son from her present one. The few indications she has of Omri's developmental problem do not bother her because the village physician says everything is okay. When Ayellet's brother, Avshy, returns to the village, it seems like a new opportunity: Avshy will replace Yaniv in the greenhouses, and Yaniv will build their new biker restaurant. However, Avshy's wife, Yaely, a physician, wants to give her marriage a second chance and comes with her husband to live on the farm. Yaely is concerned about Omri's symptoms. Meir drives the child to the closest town, where he is diagnosed as autistic. Ayellet removes Omri from kindergarten, and the family organizes an intensive therapeutic homeschooling plan. Ayellet stops spending time with her daughter and stops working. No money is left for completing the restaurant. Ayellet fires her brother from managing the greenhouses, and he becomes depressed and leaves his wife. Yaniv stops participating the homeschooling. Yaniv wants Ayellet to get pregnant again, but she refuses. Yaniv fights with Ayellet about taking Omri to community events. Yaniv wants to take him to a party at the preschool, but Omri disappears. Yaniv forces Ayellet to tell the police and the village, who are searching for Omri, that he is autistic. The family explains to everyone that calling Omri by his name will not make him answer. When night falls, Omri is found in the preschool.  British version  A British version, The A Word, began screening on the BBC in March/April 2016. As of 2020, there have been three series.

The destruction could have also been a combination of both events. Tiberias in the sixteenth century As the Ottoman Empire expanded along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan Selim I, the Catholic Monarchs began establishing Inquisition commissions. Many Conversos, (Marranos and Moriscos) and Sephardi Jews fled to the Ottoman provinces, settling at first in Constantinople, Salonika, Sarajevo, Sofia and Anatolia.

Together with its nearby military fortress, Presidio La Bah√≠a, the mission upheld Spanish territorial claims in the New World against encroachment from France. The third and final location near Goliad, Texas is maintained now as part of Goliad State Park and Historic Site. Establishment Established on 1722 on Matagorda Bay near La Salle's Fort Saint Louis on Garcitas Creek, as the mission and complementing presidio the fort was intended to secure the Texas coastline from the French and to gather the local Cocos, Copanes, and Cujanes. Being unable to attract the Indians to stay at the mission and due to violence with the Spanish soldiers, the mission was relocated only four years later, to a more favorable location on the Guadalupe River. Artifacts from this settlement are currently on display at the Museum of the Coastal Bend in Victoria.Craig H. Roell, \\"LA BAHIA,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed April 16, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Moved in 1726 near Victoria, the mission was established among the Tamique and Aranama Indians in Mission Valley. Dams and stone acequias were built to carry water from the river to the mission. A ranching outpost was also built of mortar and stone at Tonkawa Bank, on the river about 12 miles below. The presidio also followed and was built at what was later to become Fernando de Le√≥n's Ranch. The establishment prospered for 26 years, producing enough grain and hay to trade with other Spanish settlements. It was at this time that the foundation for cattle and horse ranching started. Although prosperous, Spanish officials recommended moving the mission to secure the area between B√©xar and East Texas from the encroachment of the French and English. Relocation to Goliad Mission La Bah√≠a moved in 1749 to what is now Goliad, Texas on the San Antonio River. Temporary \\"jacales\\" housing was built from log and clay (waddle and daub), with construction of stone and mortar outer defensive walls and interior buildings initiated‚Äîbut not reaching completion until 1758. The mission facilities inside the surrounding stone walls included rooms to house the priests and the Indian families, a granary, workrooms, and a separately located forge. Just across the river the complementing fortress Presidio La Bah√≠a was built. The mission found success educating and serving the tribes Aranama, Piguique, Manos de Perro, Tamique, Tawakoni, and Tonkawa in the area, but by the early 1830s was facing opposition from raiding Apaches and Comanches.Craig H. Roell and Robert S. Weddle, \\"NUESTRA SENORA DE LORETO DE LA BAHIA PRESIDIO,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed April 07, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association The mission became the first large cattle ranch in Texas, with near 40,000 free-roaming cattle at the height of production in about 1778. The large herds of Texas longhorns and mustangs were cared for by the vaquero Indians from the mission. The mission inhabitants also grew large crops of grain, fruit, and vegetables to support themselves and for trade with others. Cattle and livestock were also driven to and traded with the other missions in east Texas and western Louisiana. Closing and restoration The mission was to be secularized in 1794, but La Bah√≠a remained in service until Mexican Independence in 1821. However, two Franciscans refused to leave and remained as parish priests. In 1830 the mission was finally secularized. With most Indians having already left, the premium lands of the mission were acquired by the local Mexican and American colonists. The mission itself devolved to the City of Goliad. The old mission's stones were also allowed to be removed and used for local construction.Craig H. Roell, \\"NUESTRA SENORA DEL ESPIRITU SANTO DE ZUNIGA MISSION,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed April 16, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. The city leased the site between 1848‚Äì1856, first for a Baptist school and then a Presbyterian school, but the building gradually fell into ruin. The mission ruins became part of the newly created Goliad State Park in 1931. In 1933, the Civil Works Administration began reconstruction of the stone chapel and granary following drawings from the National Park Service and San Antonio architect Atlee Ayres. Civilian Conservation Corps Company 3822(V), with funds provided by the Works Progress Administration, finished restoring the mission between 1935 and 1941. Additional construction in the 1960s and 1980s brought the mission back its 1749 appearance. The mission was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 22, 1977. The park is currently operated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

His elder brother Adolf III of Schauenburg was his predecessor as Archbishop of Cologne (1547-1556). On 26 October 1557 the cathedral chapter of Cologne Cathedral elected Anton to be the new Archbishop of Cologne. This election was confirmed by Pope Paul IV on October 1557. Anton was never ordained as a priest or as a bishop, and had only achieved the clerical rank of subdeacon at the time of his death. He spent the bulk of his time as Archbishop attempting to improve the disastrous financial situation of the archbishopric. Anton died in June 1558. Cornelis Floris de Vriendt created matching tombs for Anton and his brother Adolf in Cologne Cathedral. Originally located in the choir, they were relocated to the apse chapels in 1863.

It was incorporated in 1846 as a branch off the Old Colony Railroad main line from Boston to Plymouth. The 3.3 mile road was completed on December 1, 1847, from Neponset Village in Dorchester, Massachusetts, through the town of Milton to the village of Mattapan. The line was leased to the Old Colony Railroad from January 1, 1848 to January 1, 1856, and operated under contract by the Old Colony from 1856 to 1863, when it was merged into the Old Colony and Fall River Railroad Company.Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners, Feb 15, 1911, p. 410 In 1893, it became part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad as part of the lease of the entire Old Colony Railroad network. From 1848 to 1872, commuter rail service to Ashmont operated over the whole line (as the Milton Branch). When the Shawmut Branch Railroad opened in 1872, Mattapan commuter service was diverted over the new line, and the Milton Branch east of Shawmut Junction saw little passenger traffic. After the Shawmut Branch was closed on September 6, 1926 for construction of the Dorchester Extension, all Mattapan passenger and freight service was rerouted via Neponset over the Milton Branch. Local residents lobbied for the restoration of a flag stop at the Granite Avenue (Granite Bridge) station to serve the Cedar Grove and Ashmont neighborhoods, a request granted in October 1926. Milton Branch freight tracks pass under the high-speed trolley line at Shawmut Junction in 1930. The first section of the Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan High-Speed Line opened from Ashmont to Milton on August 26, 1929. The high-speed trolley line entered the center of the Milton Branch right of way on a flyover, and ran to Milton flanked by the Milton Branch tracks. Commuter rail service ended when the trolley line reached Milton, over the protests of Milton residents who wanted limited service kept while the trolley line was extended to Mattapan. After four more months of construction, the full trolley line was opened to Mattapan on December 21, 1929. Freight service was retained on the line as far as Milton until the 1980s. The Neponset Trail, a multi-use rail trail, was later built on the right-of-way from Neponset Avenue to Central Avenue. From Shawmut Junction to Central Avenue, it shares the corridor with the MBTA trolley line, and occupies only the former northern freight track. An extension of the trail to Mattapan, largely parallel to the line rather than adjacent to it, opened in 2017.

Glover's Reef is a partially submerged atoll located off the southern coast of Belize, approximately 45 kilometres from the mainland. It forms part of the outermost boundary of the Belize Barrier Reef, and is one of its three atolls, besides Turneffe Atoll and Lighthouse Reef. Topography Remote view of Northeast Cay The oval-shaped atoll is long and wide. The interior lagoon is dotted with around 850 reef patches and pinnacles rising to the surface. Major cays include Amounme Point Cay, Northeast Cay, Long Cay, Middle Cay and Southwest Cay. Ecology Glover's harbours one of the greatest diversity of reef types in the western Caribbean. A large spawning site for the endangered Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) is located at the northeastern end of the atoll. It has been identified as one of only two viable sites remaining for the species, of nine originally known locations. In 2002, it was declared a special marine reserve, permanently closed to fishing. Conservation The Glover's Reef Marine Reserve was established as a national protected area in 1993 under the Fisheries Act,Government of Belize, Fisheries Act, Ch. 210 and 210s. and is managed under the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The reserve encompasses the marine area of the atoll, totaling approximately . According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), it is considered one of the highest priority areas in the Mesoamerican reef system, providing nursery and feeding areas and a unique habitat for lobster, conch and finfish. In 1996, it was designated by UNESCO as one of seven protected areas that together form the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System (a World Heritage-listed site). The marine reserve is currently divided into four different management zones, with each zone having strict regulations defining activities that are permitted and prohibited. *General Use Zone - , 74.6%; *Conservation Zone - , 20.2%; *Wilderness Zone - , 0.8%, closed to visitors; *Seasonal Closure Zone - , 4.4%, closed to all fishing from start December to end February. Where this zone overlaps with the grouper spawning aggregation site (below), it is closed to fishing all year round. A fifth zone has recently been created to offer greater protection to the northeast spawning aggregation site. It largely overlaps with the Seasonal Closure Zone. It is permanently closed to all fishing. The protected area is considered to be within IUCN's category IV: a Habitat/Species Management Area, with active management targeted at conservation through management intervention. The Wildlife Conservation Society operates the Glover's Reef Research Station on Middle Cay. It was opened in 1997 for the purpose of promoting and facilitating long-term conservation and management of the wider Belize Barrier Reef complex. Since its opening, the station has hosted more than 200 scientific and research expeditions.

E. B. Du Bois and educator Booker T. Washington that describes the social history of African-American people in the southern United States. It is a compilation of the William Levi Bull Lectures on Christian Sociology from that year. Washington and Du Bois had recently co-contributed to the Washington-edited 1903 collection The Negro Problem.Black American Writers: Bibliographical Essays, Volume 1: The Beginnings Through the Harlem Renaissance and Langston Hughes. Palgrave Macmillan UK. 1978. p. 77. .  Synopsis  The four chapters in The Negro in the South are split evenly between Du Bois and Washington, with Washington authoring the first two lectures and Du Bois authoring the latter two. = \\"The Economic Development of the Negro Race in Slavery\\" = Washington opens his first lecture discussing the institution of slavery, briefly touching upon his personal experience. He questions the difference in experiences between Native Americans and Black Americans, saying it came down to Native Americans \\"refus[ing] to submit\\" to the demands of white people. Through this comparison, he sets up his main point about the economic value of slave labor to the South's economy, where slaves worked as both skilled and common laborers, saying they could use those skills to their advantage. Washington also adds a bit to the end of his lecture regarding the relationship that Black Americans have with Christianity and how that helped them when creating a life after slavery. = \\"The Economic Development of the Negro Race Since its Emancipation\\" = Continuing where he left off on \\"the Economic Development of the Negro Race in Slavery,\\" Washington states that he wishes to talk about the things that were to Black Americans' disadvantage when creating a life post-slavery. He analyzes the educational disparity between white and Black American children, bringing up his personal experiences at the Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) and the Tuskegee Institute. Specifically, he focuses on the motivations in what Black American parents wanted out of their children's education, saying there was a transition between valuing skills like farming or household work to more traditional education, which he refers to as \\"the book.\\" This lecture contains far more anecdotes than his previous one. Washington also briefly mentions the economic costs of teaching, using Gloucester County, Virginia, as an example for this part of the lecture. = \\"The Economic Revolution in the South\\" = In Du Bois' first lecture, he touches upon similar ideas to Washington's \\"The Economic Development of the Negro Race in Slavery\\" and \\"The Economic Development of the Negro Race Since its Emancipation,\\" where Du Bois focuses on slavery as an economic driver of the South. He looks at the changes in the South after Reconstruction, where after dismantling the institution of slavery Southerners tried to keep the serfdom-like treatment of Black Americans even if slavery was no longer legal. He outlines four points regarding economy (house servant effort, effort in industry, economic elevation through landowning, and Group Economy) that have created the titular economic revolution. Finally, he talks about the migration of Black Americans to other areas. = \\"Religion in the South\\" = Du Bois discusses the ethics of slavery, looking at it through the context of Christianity. He states: > If, then, we are to study the history of religion in the South, we must > first divest ourselves of prejudice, pro and con; we must try to put > ourselves in the place of those who are seeking to read the riddle of life > and grant to them about the same general charity and same general desire to > do right that we find in the average human being. On the other hand, we must > not, in striving to be charitable, be false to truth and right. Slavery in > the United States was an economic mistake and a moral crime. This we cannot > forget. Once again, Du Bois brings up the concept of serfdom, this time going into detail about the parallels between serfdom and slavery in the South. He mentions that religion in the South originally reinforced slavery, where there was a recognized hierarchy in religious practices that were then paralleled in the practice of slavery. This notion was challenged, he says, as abolition sentiments grew stronger and the democratic Methodist and Baptist churches spread. Du Bois brings up various anecdotes shared to him by reverends and other Black Americans. He discusses the co-optation of religion by Black Americans, where Northern and Southern Black Americans worshipped in their own way.  Topics  While the four essays all deal with slavery's impact on the South since its introduction, each focuses on a specific aspect, as evidenced in their titles. Both topics, economy and religion, are topics that the two men constantly spoke about during their time as activists. = Economy = A prominent part of Washington's ideology was that in order for Black people's situation to improve, they needed a good economic foundation where they needed to work diligently and gain property. His belief was that in focusing on improving their economic situation, or valuing the importance of what he called \\"green power,\\" they would gain the rights many were fighting a losing battle for. In 1940, Du Bois was writing about his early relationship with Washington, and when discussing Washington's economic beliefs said the following: > Mr. Washington, on the other hand, believed that the Negro as an efficient > worker could gain wealth and that eventually through his ownership of > capital he would be able to achieve a recognized place in American culture > and then educate his children as he might wish and develop his > possibilities. For this reason he proposed to put the emphasis at present > upon training in the skilled trades and encouragement in industry and common > labor. Du Bois' beliefs regarding the intersection of race and economics have roots in Marxist ideology, where Du Bois over the course of his lifetime put Marx's concept of \\"economic determinism\\" into his beliefs. Marx's influence on Du Bois' interpretation of racism is further detailed in Du Bois' 1940 autobiography Dusk of Dawn, where he details his admiration for Marx and says that economy is a factor in determining \\"the basic pattern of culture.\\" In \\"The Economic Revolution in the South,\\" Du Bois touches upon aspects of Antebellum Southern culture that reinforced the institution of slavery like paternalism through his discussion of serfdom paralleling the experiences of Black people. In his use of 'serfdom' to express his points, he wants to underline that Antebellum America, especially the South, profited off the labor of slaves, and that even after the Civil War and Reconstruction there will still be attempts to continue this system in the name of profit. This concept is succinctly stated as follows: \\"racism was deeply entrenched in a long surviving economic system in which blacks were portrayed as inferior with the functional motive of facilitating economic gain.\\" = Religion = Seven years before \\"Religion in the South,\\" Du Bois wrote the brief essay \\"The Religion of the American Negro,\\" where he discussed the church's function as a haven in midst of oppression and segregation for Black people. He also used his idea of equating slavery to serfdom in other statements beyond \\"Religion in the South,\\" saying Black people had been \\"'robbed'\\" of their labor during slavery and that post-Reconstruction they had been \\"'set adrift penniless,'\\" possibly in reference to institutions to help dismantle slavery after the Civil War, like the Reconstruction Amendments and the Freedman's Bureau were not well protected by state and federal governments. He may have also been referring to the rise of sharecropping after the Civil War, which also made it difficult for former slaves to find independence of their former masters. In Du Bois' personal life, he \\"retained a deep spiritual identification with the radical, messianic tradition of black faith,\\" and was a lifelong critic of Western Christianity.

Organized in 1887 and in operation from 1887 until 1909, it served the counties of Mason and Oceana in the northwestern quarter of Michigan's Lower Peninsula in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. History =Inception= The Mason and Oceana was originally built by the Butters family, at a cost of $178,000, to help exploit the old-growth timber resources of this part of Michigan. The M&O;'s service area, in southeastern Mason County and northern Oceana County, lacked the rivers used in other parts of Michigan to transport heavy logs to sawmills. Instead of water transport, the M&O; allowed local loggers to have logs transported to the Butters & Peters Salt and Lumber Company sawmill at Buttersville, across the Pere Marquette Lake from Ludington. The settlement around the sawmill was founded by the company, hence the name The railroad was chartered as a common carrier in 1887, which meant that it operated a public passenger service.Poor's Manual of Railroads 1899 p. 383 The first section of 21 miles (34 km) opened in the same year, southeast to near Crystal Valley. In the following year, the tap line was completed to a location named Stetson, 27 miles (43.5 km) from Buttersfield.Poor's Manual of Railroads 1899 p. 383Rand McNally's Indexed Atlas of the World, 1888, Michigan map This terminus was to rename itself Walkerville in 1898. =Expansion= The Mason and Oceana initiated expansion plans to extend its common carrier line to Hesperia in 1901, but the extension was never completed.Rand McNally's Enlarged Business Atlas and Shippers Guide, 1905, Michigan map In stages, it reached Goodrich at 32 miles (51.5 km) (not to be confused with the Goodrich, Michigan located in Genesee County). and Maple at 35 miles (61 km) where it arrived in 1903. This place was also called Maple Range.Garasha, R: The Mason and Oceana Railroad, Mason County Museum Ludington, 1953 The common carrier service got no further.Ellis, D: Michigan Postal History: 1805-1986 1993 p. 433 =Contraction= After the first-growth timber resources of the Mason and Oceana service area had been exhausted, there was no longer any reason for the tiny railroad to continue in operation for its entire length. The line from Walkerville to Maple Range was abandoned in 1906,Garasha, R: The Mason and Oceana Railroad, Mason County Museum Ludington, 1953 and the rest was due to be closed down in 1908. =Grand Rapids and Northwestern Railroad= However, that was not the end of the story. The Grand Rapids and Northwestern Railroad company had been incorporated in that year, 1908, to build a trunk line from Grand Rapids to a new car ferry port to compete with the well-established one run by the Pere Marquette Railway at Ludington. Car ferries would have sailed directly to Milwaukee, and the new road would have connected with the New York Central Railroad system at Grand Rapids.The Grand Rapids Spectator Vols 1-3 1912 p. 16 The new company bought out the entire stock of the Mason and Oceana (under common carrier law, the railroad company had to be legally separate from the Butters & Peters lumber company) for $300 000 in February 1908, and immediately abandoned the line from Wiley to Walkerville.Rand McNally's Library Atlas of the World 1912, Michigan map It began converting and grading the route from Wiley, and 8 miles had been completed to Crystal Valley by the following year.Moody's Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities 1909 p. 408 In August 1909, a fire destroyed the lumber company sawmill and that was the end of any log-hauling operations on the truncated line. Unfortunately, the GR&N; scheme then failed and the remaining rails were scavenged for scrap in 1912.Connelly, E: Railroad Operations Vol.3 privately published 2002 p. 84 Route The railroad operated on a 32-mile-long main line that ran southeastward from its sawmill hub, which was located at a point on the other side of the river estuary from Ludington. This meant that the Mason & Oceana was an isolated line with no connection between it and the wider railroad network of Michigan. From Buttersville, the route ran southeast with passenger stops at Riverton, Wiley, Fern, Peachville, Crystal Valley (the station was to the east of the settlement), Lake, Walkerville, Goodrich and the railhead at Maple (also known as Maple Range, and called Beaver in 1909)Moody's Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities 1909 p. 408.

End of war  Following the English victory in the Battle of Kinsale, the leaders fighting in Cork returned to protect their homelands. The Lord Deputy of Ireland, Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, had succeeded where his predecessor, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, had failed. However, Mountjoy knew that as long as Hugh O'Neill was still in hiding, O'Neill was still a threat. Although most of the lesser chiefs allied with him had been compelled to submit, Rory O'Donnell, Brian Oge O'Rourke, Cuchonnacht Maguire (brother of Hugh Maguire), and Donal Cam O'Sullivan Beare remained loyal to The Great Earl.Sullivan, A.M., \\"Story of Ireland\\", Chapter LI. During the spring of 1603, Lord Mountjoy concentrated his campaign in the northern counties and the province of Leinster. He ordered all land be scorched. Harvests and stock were destroyed and famine soon prevailed. Mountjoy and the English Privy Council had long urged Queen Elizabeth I of England to make peace. The war was costing three quarters of the Exchequer's annual revenue, and the aged Queen had been obliged to maintain an army of 20,000 men for several years past. Thomas D'Arcy McGee, \\"A popular history of Ireland: from the earliest period to the Emancipation of the Catholics\\", Volume 1, CHAPTER XI , p.68, GLASGOW CAMERON AND FERGUSO , 1869. By contrast, the English army assisting the Dutch during the Eighty Years' War was never more than 12,000 strong Falls, Elizabeth's Irish Wars, pg 49 Horrified by the cost of the war, Elizabeth now dropped her insistence on unconditional surrender and authorised Mountjoy to treat with The O'Neill upon honourable terms. Negotiations The agents employed by the Lord Deputy in the negotiations were Sir William Godolphin and Sir Garrett Moore, an ancestor of the Marquesses of Drogheda. Moore, a personal friend of O Neill, found him in early March at his retreat near Lough Neagh and persuaded him that he should negotiate peace terms, and would travel under a safe conduct. Negotiations were conducted at Mellifont, near Ballymascanlan in County Louth. This was Sir Garret's seat, which had been sold to his family following the dissolution of the Cistercian abbey. On 27 March, Mountjoy received news that the Queen had died in London on 24 March, but he kept that information from the other parties until 5 April. Delaying the news had no legal effect, because of the principle of the demise of the Crown and the lack of an interregnum, but it might have caused a further delay if the new King James had wanted to appoint different negotiators. Terms On 30 March, Tyrone submitted to the Crown.James O'Neill, The Nine Years War, 1593-1603: O'Neill, Mountjoy and the Military Revolution, p. 192 The pardon and the terms were considered to be very generous at the time:Sullivan AM (1900)Colm Lennon, Sixteenth Century Ireland, the Incomplete Conquest, p301-302Lyons, Prof. Marian, The historiography of the Treaty of Mellifont (Seanchas Ard Mhacha / Historical Society, Armagh, 2003) * In return for renouncing the Gaelic title, U√≠ N√©ill (in English: The O'Neill), the attainder that had stripped him of the title of Earl of Tyrone was reversed, allowing him a seat in the Irish House of Lords. * He retained his traditional core territory, apart from any Church lands, which was held in freehold title under English property law. * The Earl of Tyrone swore to be loyal to the Crown and not to seek further assistance from foreign power. In return, he received a pardon. * Brehon law was to be replaced in his lands with English law. * The earls were no longer permitted to support the Gaelic bards. * English would be the official language. * Catholic colleges could not be built on his property. The terms were similar in policy to many previous \\"surrender and regrant\\" agreements conducted after 1537 between the Crown and many autonomous Irish chieftains, but unusually, the earl was not obliged to convert to the Church of Ireland.  Aftermath  By the terms of the Treaty of London, the kings of England and Spain committed each side to the cessation of \\"all hostility and enmity\\" from April 24, 1603, forward. The terms further provided that neither side would furnish \\"soldiers, provision, money [sic], arms ammunition or any other kind of assistance to forment [sic] war with the enemies and rebels of the other party\\". By that, the Irish rebels understood that no more aid could be expected from Spain. On 2 June 1603 Mountjoy left Ireland in company with Hugh O'Neill and the new lord of T√≠r Conaill, Rory O'Donnell, to see King James in London. In 1604, an Act of Oblivion declared that all \\"offences against the Crown\\" committed before the King's accession were to be \\"pardoned, remitted, and utterly extinguished\\". O'Neill returned to Ulster and appeared to have become a model subject of the Crown. Mountjoy, now a Privy Counsellor remained a champion of the terms of the Treaty and it seems he had become quite taken with his former adversary. The elderly Sir George Carey, who took over as Lord Deputy, made no attempt to clip Tyrone's wings. That state of affairs was reversed when Sir Arthur Chichester was sworn in as Lord Deputy in February 1605. Lord Deputy Chichester saw Irish Catholicism as a major threat to the crown after the Gunpowder Plot was revealed in October 1605. Though no Irish were involved in the plot, he oversaw a widespread persecution of Catholics, and he ordered the execution of two bishops. He led the campaign by royal officials, acting on the complaints of the \\"servitors\\" (tenants) to undermine the authority of Tyrone and Tyrconnell and to erode their economic base. When Hugh O'Neill and other rebel chieftains left Ireland in the Flight of the Earls (1607) to seek Spanish help for a new rebellion, Chichester became entitled to seize their lands under the law of forfeiture. The Plantation of Ulster followed within a decade.O'Neill and his party were obliged to obtain permission to leave the kingdom, and since they had not done so, their lands and titles became forfeit. Some of the loyal Gaelic lords were unhappy with the restoration of lands to the rebel leaders, and that was one factor that drove one of them, Sir Cahir O'Doherty, to launch O'Doherty's Rebellion, which he began with the Burning of Derry in 1608.

It was incorporated in 1870 to provide a rail connection between the growing railroad hub of Framingham and the important mill city of Lowell, passing through the towns of Sudbury, Concord, Acton, Carlisle, Westford and Chelmsford. The 26.1 mile line opened on October 1, 1871. On April 1, 1872 the line was leased to the Boston, Clinton and Fitchburg Railroad for twenty years. On June 1, 1876, the Boston, Clinton and Fitchburg Railroad merged with the New Bedford Railroad, forming the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad and subsequently extending the lease of the Framingham and Lowell Railroad to 998 years from October 1, 1879. On September 10, 1881, the Framingham and Lowell Railroad was deeded on execution sale to the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad, and one month later, on October 5, 1881, it was renamed as the Lowell and Framingham Railroad Company. On February 27, 1886, the line was consolidated with the Old Colony Railroad, who had previously acquired the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad in 1883.Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners, Feb 15, 1911, page 427 In 1893, the Old Colony Railroad was leased to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. From 1871, passenger service regularly consisted of three round trips a day over the entire route, one morning, one midday and one evening. In 1917 the midday round trip was dropped for additional wartime freight needs; it was never restored. In 1932 service was cut in half, leaving a southbound trip and a northbound trip between Framingham and Lowell. All regular passenger service ended in 1933, although the New Haven Railroad ran northbound ski trains along it through the 1950s. By the 1960s, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, like many railroads, was struggling to stay solvent in the face of increased competition from alternate modes of transportation, and so in 1961 it petitioned to be included in the newly formed Penn Central Transportation Company. On December 31, 1968 all of its properties were purchased by Penn Central.Drury, George H. (1994). The Historical Guide to North American Railroads: Histories, Figures, and Features of more than 160 Railroads Abandoned or Merged since 1930. Waukesha, Wisconsin: Kalmbach Publishing. pp. 222‚Äì229, 248. Penn Central, however, soon went bankrupt, and on April 1, 1976 it was taken over by Conrail. However, ownership of the former Framingham and Lowell Railroad line was not passed to Conrail, save for a small portion from South Sudbury to Framingham Center, which was named the South Sudbury Industrial Track in 1982; ownership of the line from South Sudbury to Lowell passed to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who contracted with Conrail to provide service. During the 1980s the tracks stretching from South Sudbury to Concord Junction were abandoned, and service was contracted to the Bay Colony Railroad to supply the North Acton-based lumber yards from West Concord. The present owner, CSX Transportation, took over part of the Conrail system in 1999, including one of the only remaining active portions of the Framingham and Lowell Railroad which was the South Sudbury Industrial Track (South Sudbury to Framingham Center, a 4.8 mile segment of the Lowell Secondary between the Central Mass right of way in Sudbury and the active Fitchburg Secondary in Framingham. 1.4 miles of the South Sudbury Industrial Track are in the town of Sudbury and 3.4 miles are in the town of Framingham). Service on the line ended on April 13, 2000 when the last CSX train on the South Sudbury Industrial Track derailed off a West spur which led to a lumber yard in Sudbury, this spur is located immediately South of the junction with the East West Central Mass Rail Line right of way (the Boston & Maine Railroad abandoned the Central Mass Branch Rail Line in 1980). In June 2001, CSX applied to the federal Surface Transportation Board (STB) for approval to abandon the line. In October 2001 the STB approved the abandonment, although the town of Sudbury filed notice with the STB to request that abandonment be postponed in order to allow negotiations with CSX for acquisition of the line as a rail trail. On August 2004, CSX had removed the rails and ties, leaving bridges in place in the event a path were built. By late 2005, all of the grade crossings had been removed by the Massachusetts Highway Department.

Development The railway acted as a barrier to traffic, prevented the easy commercial development of the land. The land was also a designated flood-zone, it often floods in the spring. The river (Rivi√®re des Prairies) water was badly polluted in the past so this discouraged development. The city of Montreal has given Cheval Blanc the designation of RDP 180 and tests the water quality during the summer(RSMA Le R√©seau de suivi du milieu aquatique).Service de l'environnement R√©seau de suivi du milieu aquatique Localisation des stations d'√©chantillonnage de l'eau en rive Land developers are currently trying to make money building on the \\"new\\" riverfront property.Projet Montr√©al accuse le maire Tremblay d'avoir fait perdre 4 M$ √† la Ville, Avril 28 2011 Radio-Canada In the past, landfill was added to the land to raise the lands height relative to the river height, so buildings could be built . Residents and environment groups have asked for preservation of the land. Condominium development is planned for a section of land on the far eastern part of Rapides du Cheval Blanc woods, across from Roxboro island. The traffic from the Condo's is to be connected to 5th Avenue North street. The land developers received permission from the Quebec Environment Department for a derogation that de-zoned the Pierrefonds land as unbuildable flood plain. The streets \\"Rue du Sureau\\", \\"Rue du Celtis\\", \\"Rue de L Achillee\\", and \\"Rue de L Armoise\\" were constructed in 2009 for the new buildings just west of the street Rue Riviera.

Early life McDonagh was born in Birmingham, England, and raised in Enfield, County Meath, Ireland. He moved to the United States with his dad as a teenager and took up residence in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. He joined the 18th Avenue Boxing Club where he met boxing trainers Neil Ferrara, Joe and Nick (The Thin Man) Baffi who along with his dad, Jim McDonagh trained him for the 1983 Golden Gloves. Career McDonagh fought at light-heavyweight and lost a split decision in the quarter-finals to David Harris, the eventual winner. In the 1984 Golden Gloves he fought out the Times Square Boxing Gym again lost a split decision in the heavyweight division to Ira Turner, the eventual champion. On a trip to the Catskills, Seamus visited legendary trainer Cus D'Amato and was offered the opportunity to live and train under Cus' tutelage, along with another then unknown teenager named Mike Tyson. Seamus declined, returned to Brooklyn and in 1985 won the New York State Golden Gloves heavyweight division scoring KO's in all four of his victories. Later that year he turned professional and used the money he obtained from the signing bonus to pay for his second semester at Saint John's University. It was during this time that Seamus became familiar with novelist Norman Mailer. They corresponded for many years. Seamus took most of his classes at the Staten Island campus and became a member of the fraternity Sigma Chi Upsilon (EXY).

Washington, set forth his ideas regarding the history of enslaved and freed African-American people and their need for education to advance themselves. It was re-published as a second edition in 1900 and was made available in electronic form in 2008 via Project Gutenberg.The Future of the American Negro at Project Gutenberg.  Background  In the beginning of the book, the author mentions the term \\"industrial education\\". Washington describes this term as meaning, learning the necessities to become a valuable member of society as well and being able to apply this knowledge to industrial business. He believes that even though slavery is illegal, the freed African- Americans are still enslaved to the white people. Those who are freed cannot be members of society because they are not given the same opportunities. As the book continues, Booker T. Washington writes that in order to understand the stress he applies to industrial education, the reader must \\"review the condition of affairs at the present time in the Southern States.\\" He provides the information that the North and South are linked even though they were once at war. If the North cannot provide education then the South will not provide it. Washington also states that the African-Americans are not superior, but that they are definitely not inferior to the white people. Slaves have had a hard time throughout their life in the United States. Their strength, knowledge, and perseverance has been tested by the white people that have run their lives for the longest time. Booker T. Washington asks, why should African-Americans have to prove themselves over and over when they have been proving themselves since they entered the country? The author also reminds them that, \\"An individual cannot succeed unless that individual has a great amount of faith himself.\\" African-Americans can have all the faith they want, but Washington argues that knowledge is needed to become useful members of society. Blacks have worked hard but will have to understand what they are working for. Throughout the book, Washington refers to Tuskegee, a university founded by himself and others. It was a historically black university in Tuskegee, Alabama. In The Future of an American Negro, Booker writes that the university is, \\"placing men and women of intelligence, religion, modesty, conscience, and skill in every community in the South.\\" Washington believes that Tuskegee University is providing the South with valuable members of society. In \\"Chapter V\\", there is a reference to a study showing that some 3,000 graduates or students are doing \\"commendable\\" work in the Southern community. Near the end of the book, Washington describes the difference for freed slaves in the North and South. He reminds the reader that North has fewer employment option for black people which perpetuates the stress on the morals of an African-American. The South, however, having more opportunities for work and less stress on trying to do the right thing. He goes on to end the book with five principles that will aid African-Americans in their fight to have truly equal rights and opportunities. He states that these principle will be essential by saying, \\"So long as the Negro is permitted to get education, acquire property, and secure employment, and is treated with respect in the business or commercials world, ‚Ä¶ I shall have the greatest faith in his working out his own destiny in the Southern States.\\" Notes See also * List of books written by Booker T.

A steep hill descending into a switchback road, it is a popular training route for competitive bicyclists and runners. Although the name is usually omitted from maps today, McGowan's Pass was clearly marked on charts of the region from the Revolutionary War until the early 20th century. It acquired its name from the McGowan or McGown family who kept a tavern near there from 1756 through the Revolutionary period, and owned the surrounding property until the 1840s. The area was incorporated into Central Park after 1860, when the park's boundaries were extended north from the line of 106th Street to 110th Street, and the Harlem Meer was built in the park's northeast corner.

In Dutch Colonial days, this area of north Manhattan was part of the \\"commons,\\" land administered by the community of Nieuw Haarlem as a whole. During the late 17th century, as Manhattan passed back and forth between the Dutch and English, the colony of New Harlem lost its autonomy. Common Lands were sold off in 1712. Much of this property in upper Manhattan passed to members of the extensive Benson and Dyckman families, who would continue to own much of northern Manhattan well into the 19th century.James Riker, Revised History of Harlem, 1906. In the 1740s, Jacob Dyckman, Jr. purchased the lands along the Pass from his Uncle George. He planted orchards and built a house and outbuildings, including a public house, \\"At the Sign of the Black Horse.\\" During a yellow fever epidemic in 1752, the Colonial Assembly decamped from downtown New York and met in the Black Horse tavern, while boarding a half-mile east at the farm of Dyckman's cousin, Benjamin Benson. In 1756, Dyckman decided to move back north near his family in Spuyten Duyvil, and build a new tavern by the Harlem River. He advertised his Harlem property for saleNew York Mercury, March 8, 1756. The advertisement is quoted in I. N.

Revolutionary War to Civil War From 1776 until 1783, during the British occupation of New York, McGowan's Pass was a key high-ground position on the route between New York City to the south and Fort Knyphausen (Fort Washington) to the north. For most of this period, the area around the Pass was the site of a Hessian encampment.The Journal of Lieutenant von Krafft, 1776-1784, p. 15 gives detailed descriptions of deployment and logistics of the time. After the Treaty of Paris, British and Hessians marched through the Pass when evacuating north Manhattan; and George Washington likewise came through the Pass when he reentered New York on Evacuation Day, November 25, 1783. After the war, John Leggett and his family moved into the Black Horse Edward T. Williams, Niagara County, New York: A Concise Record of Her Progress and People, 1921.

Looking southwest in 1816. Pass gatehouse with fortifications on either side.

Also built nearby were Fort Clinton, Fort Fish, and Nutter's Battery along the north side of the Pass, remnants of which can still be seen.Central Park website. There was also a gatehouse straddling the road just east of present-day Lasker Rink, near the grid coordinates of 107th Street and Lenox Avenue (formerly Sixth Avenue), where present-day East Drive makes its first downhill switchback. This 1860s route of East Drive was partially constructed over the old earthwork fortifications. The chapel of Mount St. Vincent's Academy, a convent school built around the old McGown house, was built in 1847. It became the U.S. General Hospital or St. Joseph's Military Hospital, during the American Civil War from 1862 to 1865, after the Mount St. Vincent Academy moved north to its present campus in Riverdale. From 1859 to 1863, Frederick Law Olmsted and his family lived in the Mount St. Vincent's buildings, while Olmsted directed the landscaping of Central Park.Melvin Kalfus, Frederick Law Olmsted: The Passion of a Public Artist. 1991.

From the 1860s to the 1880s, the Park Commission leased out the old school grounds as a sculpture museum and tavern, while the hill continued to be known as Mount St. Vincent's. When Central Park was being built, a lake called Harlem Meer was constructed from a natural waterway north of McGowan's Pass. A new section of East Drive was made to veer sharply to the west and south and again to the north, bypassing the Meer.Clarence Cook, A Description of the Central Park in New York. 1869. = Tavern = A refreshment house, known as Mount St. Vincent's Hotel, opened at McGowan's Pass in 1883‚Äì1884. Its proprietor until 1890 was Patrick H. McCann, brother- in-law to local Tammany Hall leader Richard Croker and sometime friend of Hugh Grant, Mayor of New York. During the Fassett Investigation in 1890, McCann testified that he lost his lease to the tavern because he refused to provide Croker, Grant and their political associates with free entertainment; in retaliation for which Croker and Grant began to bad-mouth the restaurant as a disreputable house patronized by lowlifes.New York Times, April 26, 1890. \\"Result of a Family Row.\\" After McCann the tavern was leased by Gabriel Case, and finally by John Scherz. The name of the tavern caused confusion for visiting parents who told their cab driver to take them to Mount St. Vincent's and found themselves at a large, convivial saloon in Central Park, instead of a sedate convent school. Accordingly the Park Commission officially designated the region \\"McGown's Pass\\" on maps and signage, and renamed the \\"Mount St. Vincent's Hotel\\" roadhouse as \\"McGown's Pass Tavern.\\"Edward Hagaman Hall, McGown's Pass and Vicinity (NY: 1905), 26, accessed May 8, 2011 The tavern's new name hearkened back to a local watering-hole of a century before, the Black Horse Tavern, popularly known as McGowan's. In 1906 a plaque commemorating the \\"McGown\\" family and the Pass was installed nearby at the Fort Clinton memorial. In 1915 the tavern was closed down and its furnishings auctioned off. The New York Times reported that its equipment, furniture, sporting prints, and \\"Old Gabe,\\" the tavern's yellow parrot, brought in barely $1,500.New York Times, March 10, 1915. \\"McGown's Pass Has Its Tavern No More.\\" The old tavern's driveways and foundations remain in use by the Central Park Conservancy, which uses it as a composting area and has reverted to calling it \\"The Mount.\\"Central Park Conservancy site ; confuses the various taverns in the region.

Biblical Narrative  In the Gospel of John, the prediction is preceded by the assertion in 13:17-18 that Jesus knew that Judas Iscariot would betray him: \\"If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled: He who eats my bread lifted up his heel against me.\\"Craig A. Evans 2005 The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: John's Gospel, Hebrews-Revelation page 122 The blessing in John 13:17 is thus not directed at the Iscariot. In Matthew 26:23-25, Jesus confirms the identity of the traitor: > \\"The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man > through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if > he had not been born.\\" Judas, who betrayed him, answered: \\"It isn't me, is > it, Rabbi?\\" He said to him: \\"You said it.\\" The attribution of the title Rabbi to Jesus by the Iscariot in this episode is unique to him, for one after another the other Apostles say \\"Surely it is not I, Lord\\", using the Lord (Kyrios) title.Anthony Cane 2005 The Place of Judas Iscariot in Christology page 35 The Iscariot again calls Jesus Rabbi in Matthew 26:49 when he betrays him to the Sanhedrin in the Kiss of Judas episode.

Biography Friedrich IV of Wied was born in 1518, the son of Graf Johann II of Wied and his wife Elisabeth of Nassau-Dillenburg. Friedrich's parents groomed him for a life in the church from a young age. He became dean of the Stift of St Cassius at Bonn Minster in 1534. On 31 August 1537 he became a canon of Cologne Cathedral. He later held a number of offices in the Cologne cathedral chapter, including provost (1546); Chorbischof (elected 12 December 1548); Thesaurar (elected 3 July 1549); assistant dean (elected 23 August 1558); and dean (elected 23 November 1558). On 19 November 1562, the cathedral chapter elected Friedrich as the new Archbishop of Cologne. Friedrich, however, refused to take the oath approving the Council of Trent (the so-called Professio fidei Tridentina), not on religious grounds, but because he saw it as an affront to a reigning sovereign. Pope Pius IV therefore refused to confirm Friedrich's election as Archbishop. Although he was frequently denounced as a secret Protestant in the circles around the pope (one of his predecessors, his uncle Hermann of Wied, had in fact converted to Protestantism), Friedrich rebuffed efforts by Protestant princes to have him introduce Protestantism in the Electorate of Cologne. Pope Pius V continued Pius IV's policy of refusing to confirm Friedrich as Archbishop of Cologne if Friedrich would not swear the Professio fidei Tridentina and threatened to withdraw the cathedral chapter's right to select the Archbishop of Cologne. He ordered Friedrich to resign on 7 August 567. Friedrich traveled to the papal court in Rome to seek confirmation of his election, and was granted an extension of time until 25 November 1567. After great pressure was applied by the representative of Emperor Maximilian II, Friedrich finally resigned on 24 October 1567. Friedrich spent his last years as a recluse in Cologne. He died on 23 December 1568.

To Fairer Votes was a political campaign in the United Kingdom whose purpose was to persuade the public to vote in favour of the Alternative Vote (AV) in the referendum on Thursday, 5 May 2011. YES! To Fairer Votes was unsuccessful in changing the voting system, with 32.1% of votes cast in favour. It was opposed by the anti-reform campaign No to AV. Structure YES! To Fairer Votes was a non-profit making organisation established as a company limited by guarantee called Yes In May 2011 Ltd. Its board was chaired by Katie Ghose (Chief Executive of the Electoral Reform Society). Other members were Pam Giddy (of Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust), Neal Lawson (of Compass), Vicky Seddon (of Unlock Democracy) and John Sharkey (of the Liberal Democrats). Campaign funding The Guardian's analysis also showed that the YES! To Fairer Votes campaign had outspent the anti-AV campaign by ¬£3.4m to ¬£2.6m, with most of the funding coming from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust and the Electoral Reform Society (ERS). George Osborne the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer accused the ERS of having a vested interest in a yes vote, as their commercial subsidiary Electoral Reform Services Ltd (ERSL) was printing the postal ballots for the referendum. The Press Complaints Commission later ruled against this. The Sun and Mail subsequently had to print retractions. Campaign criticism A number of post mortems of the campaign were written, all highly critical of the way the campaign was run and of its major backers failure to deal with these issues. The Electoral Reform Society's formal post mortem on the campaign led by Professor John Curtice of the University of Strathclyde identified that \\"The criticisms of AV put forward by the ‚ÄòNo‚Äô campaign were far more popular and proved more effective in shaping how people eventually voted on 5 May. The ‚ÄòYes‚Äô campaign‚Äôs key arguments were either lost or did not resonate with people in terms of why they should vote ‚Äòyes‚Äô.\\" Andy May, a key member of the Yes Campaign, drew attention to a number of strategic blunders in the campaign and criticised the campaign director and senior staff. His view was corroborated by another insider account by former staff member James Graham. Anthony Barnett criticised one of the major funders, the Joseph Rowntree Reform trust for lack of oversight and scrutiny of its huge donation. Criticism of the Electoral Reform Society's role was also widespread and resulted in major changes to the organisation. In the council elections in 2011 there were 52 candidates for the 15 places available. Only four of the previous council were re-elected with eight of the new members having stood explicitly on a joint platform of reforming the society.  Political parties supporting YES!

In 1964 he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for aggravated robbery. In April 2011, after a legal battle lasting nearly fifty years, Hinse was awarded $13.1 million compensation, payable by the Quebec and Canadian Federal governments, the largest wrongful conviction award in Canadian history. Hinse spent three years on remand and served another five years after sentence. He campaigned to establish his innocence based on the fact that he had been in Montreal, over two hundred kilometres away, at the time the crime was committed. In 1989 the Quebec Police Commission concluded that Hinse was the victim of \\"a botched investigation\\". Although his conviction was quashed by the Quebec Court of Appeal in 1994, partly because of new evidence, and a stay of proceedings was ordered, Hinse continued to argue his innocence. In 1997 he was acquitted by the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that evidence presented at his trial was insufficient to convict him of aggravated robbery.\\"50 years after arrest, Quebecer awarded $13.1 million for wrongful conviction\\" by Anne Sutherland, Montreal Gazette April 14, 2011, accessed 16 April 2011 Despite Hinse's acquittal by the Supreme Court of Canada, the Quebec and federal governments refused to acknowledge his innocence.

As part of the legislative enactment for the name change, the proposal was to extend the line north from Sandwich and connect with the Old Colony and Newport Railway terminus at Plymouth.

It is named for Habib Bourguiba, the first President of Tunisia and the national leader of the Tunisian independence movement. Today, the broad Avenue aligned in an east- west direction, lined with trees and facades of shops, and fronted with street cafes on both sides, and which is compared to the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, and its extension, the Avenue de France, Place de l'Ind√©pendance marking the central roundabout with Lake of Tunis at the eastern end. Many of the important monuments are located along this avenue, including Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul, French Embassy in Tunisia and Th√©√¢tre municipal de Tunis. Most cities in Tunisia also have an Avenue Habib Bourguiba. History Avenue de la Marine in 1885 The road was originally known as the \\"Promenade de la Marine\\", a poor quality road which grew muddy in winter and dusty in summer.Sebag, p. 338 Within thirty years after the introduction of the French protectorate of Tunisia, the town grew up to the east of the Medina. The Consulate of France, became the seat of the French residence and built in 1890‚Äì1892.Sebag, p. 347 The avenue became the entertainment centre of the city too, and the playground for the city's elite. In 1920 the Municipal Theatre was built.Sebag, p. 348 In addition, the Cath√©drale Saint-Vincent-de-Paul de Tunis was completed in 1897.Sebag, p. 349 On the eve of the First World War, the new major street in the centre was renamed Avenue Jules-Ferry after Jules Ferry. During the protests of 2011, many demonstrations calling for the downfall of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and that of the national unity government were held on the avenue. Layout Sixty meters wide, it has two unpaved roads on both sides of a median strip planted with, until 2001, a quadruple range of ficus trees (reduced to two rows in a major 2000‚Äì2001 renovation).Sebag, pp. 346‚Äì347 Important private buildings such as The Coliseum (galleries, cafes and movie theatres) in 1931 and the Hotel Claridge in 1932 came to be built.Sebag, p. 441 At the advent of independence in 1956, the statue was toppled and the avenue was renamed after the new president Habib Bourguiba.Sebag, p. 626 New private buildings emerged from extensive investments, such as international hotels. The Bab Bhar (Porte de France), now a free-standing arch, is located at the termination of the Avenue de France, which in itself is an extension of the Ave Habib Bourgiba; beyond this old portal is the medina. At the eastern end of the Avenue Bourguiba, there is a causeway crossing Lake Tunis that carries the road and metro rail traffic and connects the city center with the La Goulette (Halq al Wadi), an elegant old port; the posh suburbs of Carthage, Sidi Bou Said and La Marsa. To the west of the Bab Bhar is the Rue de La Kasbah that terminates at the Government offices on the other side of the port; the Rue Jema Mosque (Grand Mosque) is at the heart of the port. Avenue Jules-Ferry (1954) Unrest in 2011 Place de l'Ind√©pendance Statue of Ibn Khaldoun at the Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul To the west, the artery ends on the Place de l'Ind√©pendance (Independence Square). The space is framed by the French Embassy and Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul. At its centre stands a statue of the Tunisian philosopher and historian Ibn Khaldoun, looking towards the Avenue Habib Bourguiba and lake beyond. It had originally been intended for the statue to be erected on June 1, 1978, on the anniversary of Habib Bourguiba's return to Tunis after the French colonialism, but it did not take place until July 3. =French Embassy= Place de l'Ind√©pendance The French Embassy in Tunisia, opening on the south side of the square, is located in buildings constructed in December 1861. Twenty years later they became the general residence of the French in Tunis. =Cath√©drale Saint-Vincent-de-Paul= The Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul, originally the seat of the Archdiocese of Carthage, sits opposite the French Embassy. Built in a Romanesque-Byzantine style at the end the nineteenth century, it opens on the north side of the square. =Municipal Theatre= Art nouveau facade of the theatre The Municipal Theatre, which opened November 20, 1902, is one of the few theatres in Art Nouveau style in the world. Partially demolished in 1909, it was converted and enlarged to be opened again on January 4, 1911. A total renovation of the theatre was completed in 2001 for its centenary.

It belongs to the civil parish of Benenden and the Tunbridge Wells Borough District of Kent, in the South East of England. In Old English 'Iden' refers to a 'pasture by the yew trees' (from ig 'yew' + denn 'pasture'). Hence the village's name means 'a pasture of green by the yew trees'. The village of Iden Green should not be confused with the nearby hamlet named Iden Green between Goudhurst and Cranbrook.  History  The discovery of various fragments of Iron Age pottery, struck flint flakes and iron slag, indicate that some areas of the parish were settled during the Iron Age, perhaps as early as 1500 BC. Iden Green's main street, Mill Street, was a Roman Road that connected Hastings to Maidstone, so the village began its main growth along a 'Roman thoroughfare' centred around the existing farmsteads of Eaglesden, Iden Green Farm and Yew Tree Farm; which had organically nestled themselves into the Wealden landscape with their far reaching views of the rolling valleys. However, the village expanded to its greatest extent during the 16th century, as part of Cranbrook's thriving Wealden cloth industry, as is clearly evidenced by the numerous workmen's cottages that sprung up in the village during that time, many of which still exist today. The manor of Benenden, which included Iden Green, was given by William the Conqueror to his brother Odo the Bishop of Baieux in 1067 and the manor is one of the few parish's in the Weald included in the Doomsday Book of 1086, by name. A paved ford built in Roman times still exists in Iden Green, having been discovered during excavations in 1935. It was common around AD43 for the Romans to pave fords in Britain to allow easy access by pedestrians, horses and carts. The Paved Ford in Iden Green is protected by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 as being of national and historic importance. The first Ordnance Survey map of the area, surveyed 1870‚Äì1871 and published in 1887, details that the village centred around four main farms; the largest being Eaglesden manor, its oast, workers cottages and its farm, in the south of the village, in addition to Iden Green Farm to the east (along Weavers Lane), Yew Tree Farm which occupied the centre of the current village and Framefarm in the northern area. Other houses mentioned in this first Ordnance Survey of the area include Thorne Charity House (near the site of the current tennis club), Smithey (near the site of the monument on the corner of Standen Street) and Albion Cottage (opposite Mr Noah's Nursery). Hemsted Park was granted to the Guldefords in 1388 and the family became a large part of the history of the parish for over 300 years. Richard Guldeford's official title was 'Richard Guildford of Hemsted in Benenden and Halden in Rolvenden' and he fought alongside Henry VII when he gained the Crown at Bosworth Field in 1485. Hemsted became a great house with a hunting park and was visited by Queen Elizabeth I, hosting her for over 3 nights in 1573. In 1702, Hemsted was sold to the Admiral of the Fleet, Sir John (Foulweather Jack) Norris. The house itself was modernised during and after Sir John‚Äôs ownership. His grandson, John Norris, came to live there with his wife, Kitty Fisher. She is famed in a nursery rhyme as the one who found Lucy Locket‚Äôs pocket (she lived at Babb‚Äôs Farm) and was 'buried in her best ball-gown' in Benenden churchyard. Commemorative wells were built in the parish to celebrate Queen Victoria‚Äôs Golden Jubilee in 1887 in Benenden, and the Diamond Jubilee in 1897 in Iden Green. Lord Rothermere bought Hemsted in 1912 and during 1923-24 the estate was dispersed. Benenden School bought Hemsted House and park and the farms were sold at auction in Maidstone. Symbolic of the end of an era was the felling of the great Hemsted Oak in New Pond Road, 'probably the finest specimen of an oak in the South of England'. The trunk, weighing eight tons, went to the Wembley Exhibition of 1924. Lord Rothermere became a great benefactor to the parish of Benenden and Iden Green, giving to Benenden, the St George‚Äôs Club, War Memorial, and recreation ground (where the village hall now stands) and giving to Iden Green, two allotment fields and the Iden Green recreation ground and Pavilion. In addition, he set up a trust fund for their maintenance which still exists today, almost 100 years later. The current Lord Rothermere, Jonathan Harmsworth - the 4th Viscount Rothermere, is the owner of Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, Mail On Sunday and Metro. On 6 March 2016, HRH Princess Anne The Princess Royal, an ex-pupil of Benenden School for Girls, visited Iden Green to open six new homes on Standen Street as part of Kent's affordable housing scheme. This was in addition to the six houses built in 1994. The land had been gifted to the Tunbridge Wells Borough Council by Viscount Rothermere.  Governance  The village is part of the Borough of Tunbridge Wells and is represented in Parliament by Helen Grant, MP for Maidstone and The Weald.  Geography  The village is located amongst low-lying hills known as The Weald, which is situated between the North and South Downs and resting within the north eastern sector of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Iden Green is situated between four small towns; Staplehurst to the north, Tenterden to the east, Hawkhurst to the south and the nearest town of Cranbrook to the west. The geology of the High Weald consists largely of a series of hard standstone strata, underlain by heavy clays, giving rise to a combination which occurs across the Weald of sandstone ridges and clay vales. Combined with faulting and watercourses cutting into the rock sequences, this has led to the smooth rolling uplands, plateaus and ridgelines, strongly incised by deep stream valleys (ghylls).  Demography  The 1986 Census of the United Kingdom detailed that Iden Green had a population of 380, with it being largely a village of young families. There were 132 children under 18, 160 adults and 88 elderly residents.  Economy  The Woodcock Inn is the only pub in Iden Green itself and is a 17th-century traditional public house with an enclosed beer garden, located off Standen Street.  Culture and community  The Iden Green recreational park contains a young children's playground and is used for village activities, such as fetes with live music and games of rounders.  Landmarks  The Iden Green Pavilion has a capacity of 70 and today serves as a village hall for the local village community. Between 1945 and 1954 the Pavilion served as the village church following the doodlebug bomb damage to the village's chapel on Chapel Street (behind the tennis club). The building of the new Congregational Church on New Pond Road in 1954 returned use of the Pavilion to a village hall.  Transport  The nearest railway stations are Staplehurst to the north, and Etchingham to the southwest. The A229 road lies 5 km to the west and runs north‚Äìsouth between Maidstone and Hurst Green. Further west (approximately 10 km), the A21 runs north‚Äìsouth and stretches between London and Hastings.  Education  Mr Noah's is a nursery school in Iden Green that focuses on foundation stage children. Originally set up in 1995, the nursery is linked to Iden Green Congregational Church. The nearest primary schools are in Benenden and Sandhurst.  Religious sites  Iden Green Congregational Church is an evangelical church. The current brick building was completed in 1954, with extensions built in 1999 and 2013. This new building on New Pond Road replaced the World War II bomb-damaged chapel on Chapel Lane (to the rear of the tennis club) which was of a simple weatherboarded construction (originally constructed in 1837 by Mr Thomas Avery).  Sport  To the rear of the village green is the Iden Green Tennis Club, which contains two outdoor courts and a clubhouse.

Life and cricket career Greenway was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 29 October 1864. He was educated at Cheltenham College where he played for the school's cricket team, appearing against Clifton College and Marlborough College in each of 1881 and 1882. An opening batsman, he enjoyed some success in 1881, scoring a half-century, and narrowly missing out on another. He was captain of the school eleven in 1882. Later in 1882 he played a solitary first-class match for Somerset County Cricket Club, batting as part of the top order against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He was one of only three players to reach double-figures for Somerset in the first innings, scoring 18, but only scored one run in the second innings of the match. He travelled as part of George Vernon's team to tour Ceylon and India in the English winter of 1889‚Äì90, playing as an opening batsman and wicket-keeper. The highlight of his tour was the unbeaten 130 that he scored against the Calcutta Club in the first match of the tour. Later, he played a number of matches against second-class counties for the MCC. One MCC match in 1895, against Essex, was his second and final first-class game: he scored 8 and 4 in a low-scoring match that was over inside two days. Later he appeared in the Minor Counties Championship for Northumberland from 1900 to 1902. In late 1913, aged 48, Greenway captained the Incogniti team on a tour of North America.

Jacob expelled all Jews from the Archbishopric of Mainz in 1507 (they had already been expelled from the city of Mainz in 1470). Jacob died on 15 September 1508 and is buried in Mainz Cathedral. His funerary monument was designed by Hans Backoffen.

Its of collections and exhibit space were first opened to the public on October 16, 2010; since then it has received over 35,000 visitors per year. Its collections include over two million specimens collected between the 1910s and the present, comprising the Cowan Tetrapod Collection, the Marine Invertebrate Collection, the Fossil Collection, the Herbarium, the Spencer Entomological Collection, and the Fish Collection. The collections focus in particular on the species of British Columbia, Yukon, and the Pacific Coast. The museum's most prominent display is a skeleton of a female blue whale buried in Tignish, Prince Edward Island, which is suspended over the ramp leading to the main collections. Location and access The Beaty Biodiversity Museum and the Biodiversity Research Centre are located in the Beaty Biodiversity Centre at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The complex's address is 2212 Main Mall, Point Grey, Vancouver, British Columbia. Directly adjacent to the museum is the UBC Fisheries Centre which features an atrium display of skeletons of a minke whale, a killer whale, two Steller sea lions, and three Pacific white-sided dolphins. =Facility= The centre is housed in a , four-storey building. The building was designed by Patkau Architects in 2009 and built by Scott Construction. It formed the final side of a landscaped quadrangle created by the 2006 construction of the Aquatic Ecosystems Research Laboratory. The Beaty Biodiversity Museum features several laboratories The museum includes a theatre and of collections and exhibit space. It is entered through the Mowafaghian Atrium, a glass-walled gallery two storeys tall which, in addition to the museum's gift shop and the Niche Cafe, houses the museum's signature piece: Canada's largest blue whale skeleton. The display is a \\"see-through box\\" whose fa√ßade windows have \\"steel mesh brises-soleils\\". The museum lies parallel to one of the main walking routes of the university campus, was described in Exploring Vancouver: the architectural guide as \\"a perfect commission for architects known for creative restraint\\". The whale is suspended over a descending ramp by which the collections are accessed. The space also includes a \\"family zone\\" with juvenile reading materials and a teaching collection in a Discovery Lab.Beaty Biodiversity Museum (pamphlet) Most of the collections are displayed in cabinet windows and shadow boxes, although a few are shown through alternative displays like in-ground \\"excavations\\" that under glass that visitors can walk on. The $50-million building was designed in the interests of sustainability. It has a green roof and a reed water garden to reduce pollutants and improve drainage of storm water from the building. The centre does not have air conditioning, except in some of its laboratories; instead, the temperature level is mediated by natural ventilation through the facility's concrete walls and by the use of sunshades on the outside of the building. Natural lighting is also optimized to reduce the building's use of electricity, which also assists in the preservation of some light-sensitive collections. Finally, the centre includes several \\"recycling hubs\\" and has facilities for the composting of organic waste material. Museum history The individual collections housed in the Beaty Biodiversity Museum predate the museum's construction, with some collections dating back to the early 20th century. However, all of these collections were kept separately at various locations across campus. The idea for a single museum to house all of these collections was first put forward in 2001 by university faculty in the Departments of Zoology and Botany, who suggested \\"a building that would facilitate interdisciplinary work on biodiversity, house UBC's biodiversity researchers and collections, and contain a public natural history museum\\". What would become the dynamic working and learning environment of the Beaty Biodiversity Museum benefited from the inspired architectural design and work of Patkau Architects. The museum is named after Ross and Trisha Beaty, UBC alumni who donated C$8 million in funding to support its creation. The Biodiversity Centre also received $16.5 million from each of the BC Knowledge Development Fund and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, $3 million from the Djavad Mowafaghian Foundation, and $6 million from the university. The founding Director was Dr. Wayne Maddison and the current Director is Dr. Quentin Cronk of the Department of Botany. Collection The museum houses a collection of more than two million specimens, some dating back to as early as the 1910s. These specimens are divided into six main subcollections - the Cowan Tetrapod Collection, the Marine Invertebrate Collection, the Herbarium, the Spencer Entomological Collection, the Fish Collection, and the Fossil Collection - and over 500 permanent exhibits. Most items are accompanied by a description card briefly outlining details like the species and provenance information. =Blue Whale Exhibit= A skeleton of a female blue whale at the Mowafaghian Atrium The museum's signature piece is its 25-metre skeleton of a female blue whale. The skeleton, housed in the museum's glass atrium, is Canada's largest blue whale skeleton, the \\"largest skeleton exhibit in the world suspended without external framework for support\\", and one of only 21 blue whale skeletons on public display worldwide. The Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa began exhibiting its juvenile blue whale skeleton at around the same time. The process of recovering, transporting and displaying the whale was featured in a Discovery Channel documentary called Raising Big Blue, first aired in Canada on June 5, 2011. This documentary is frequently screened at the museum's theatre. =Cowan Tetrapod Collection= Examples of items in the Cowan Tetrapod collection The Cowan Tetrapod Collection was founded in 1951. The collection is named after its first curator, Dr. Ian McTaggart-Cowan, and was originally named the \\"Cowan Vertebrate Museum\\". It combined several pre- existing collections, including the K. Racey birds and mammals collection, the WS Maguire and J. Wynne zoology materials, and the HR Macmillan birds collection. The collection contains over 40,000 items representing over 2,000 species of vertebrates - 18,000 mammals from 540 species, 17,500 birds and 7,000 bird eggs, and 1,600 reptiles and amphibians - making it the second largest collection of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians in British Columbia. The museum holds extensive, representative samples of nearly all species - and most subspecies - of British Columbia's terrestrial vertebrates and marine mammals. The collection includes older specimens dating back to 1849, as well as rare specimens such as the red panda, the endangered Vancouver Island marmot, and even extinct species such as the passenger pigeon. Over 39,000 items from the Cowan Tetrapod Collection have been indexed in Vertnet, a \\"collaborative project funded by the National Science Foundation that aims to make biodiversity data free and openly accessible on the web from publishers worldwide\\". =Marine Invertebrate Collection= Shells in the Marine Invertebrate Collection The Marine Invertebrate Collection was started in the 1930s with alcohol-preserved specimens collected by Dr. C. McLean Fraser and Dr. Ian McTaggart Cowan. The collection was primarily used for teaching purposes and eventually grew to several thousand specimens encompassing the major lineages of invertebrate animals. The collection was expanded in 2006, due to the donation of thousands of shells and corals by Kelly Norton. The collection was further expanded the following year with a large donation from Evelyn Hebb Killiam. Items in the collection represent the \\"major lineages of animals\\" and include cnidarians, molluscs, annelids, echinoderms, crustaceans, and sponges. The collection has not yet been fully catalogued. =Herbarium= Examples from the Seed Collection The Herbarium is among the oldest collections at UBC. It was established in 1912 by John Davidson, who was at that time the BC provincial botanist. His collection of mostly vascular plants was housed in downtown Vancouver at the Botanical Offices on West Pender Street. In 1925, it was relocated to the university campus. A seed collection arose independently via donations of large collections, particularly those of A.J. Hill, Eli Wilson, W. Taylor and A.E. Baggs. An algal collection also appeared prior to 1952, based on a donation by Mirian Armstead; although it was initially quite small, under the curatorship of Robert Scagel it expanded rapidly to a 67,000-item scope. The Bryological Collection was begun by V.J. Krajina in 1949; in 1960, Dr. W.B. Schofield became the \\"first bryologist to be hired by a Canadian university\\", and he curated and expanded the collection over several years. All of these disparate collections were consolidated into the Herbarium, then hosted by the university's biology department, in 1973, and the entire collection was ported into the Beaty Biodiversity Museum upon its completion. The Herbarium contains more than 650,000 specimens, and it is the largest herbarium in Canada west of Ottawa. The specimens in the herbarium are used to help researchers identify the plants, describe new species, and track changes in diversity over time. The herbarium collection includes the land plants‚Äîconifers, ferns, mosses, flowering plants, and their relatives as well as algae, lichens and fungi. The collection comprises 223,000 vascular plants, 85,000 algae, 242,000 bryophytes, 16,000 fungi, and 40,000 lichens. Important strengths of the collection include the plants of British Columbia generally, \\"Pacific algae, fungi, Hawaiian plants, tropical prayer plants, and cyanolichens\\". Its algal collection is \\"the most comprehensive of any Herbarium\\", particularly in its coverage of the northeast Pacific Ocean species. Its bryophyte collection is the largest in Canada, while the fungi collection includes the \\"largest research collection of macrofungi of British Columbia\\" and the lichen collection is among the largest in western North America. The vascular plants collection is two-thirds Canadian (45% from British Columbia and 22% from other provinces and territories), 16% American (9% from Hawaii and the Pacific coast and 7% from the other states), and 17% from other countries. Among the Herbarium's holdings are 498 type specimens. =Spencer Entomological Collection= Insect specimen from 1910 The Spencer Entomological Collection was begun by Dr. George Spencer in the 1920s and includes specimens from as early as the 1830s. At the time of its creation it was not a university- recognized collection, but by the time of Spencer's retirement it comprised over 300,000 items. It was officially founded as a university collection in 1953 \\"as a retirement gift from his students and the Department of Zoology.\\" Dr. G.G.E. Scudder assumed the curatorship of the collection in 1958, doubling the size of the collection in his 40 years in that role. Now comprising over 600,000 items - over 500,000 pinned insects, 25,000 on slides, and 75,000 in alcohol - the Spencer Entomological Collection is the second-largest in Canada and focuses on the insects of British Columbia and Yukon. The collection has \\"particularly strong holdings of Hemiptera (true bugs), Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), Siphonaptera (fleas) and Anoplura and Mallophaga (lice).\\" In addition to specimens, the collection also includes 350 books and other printed materials relevant to the study of entomology. A number of items in the collection have not yet been indexed. =Fish Collection= Dr. C. MacLean Fraser, the first head of UBC's Department of Zoology, donated her collections to the university in the 1940s. They were displayed in a UBC Fish Museum, which was first catalogued in 1945. The UBC Institute of Fisheries was founded in 1952, beginning a period of rapid collections expansion under the curatorship of M.A. Newman. In addition to amending the storage, preservation and recording of specimens, he also oversaw the addition of materials from \\"three expeditions to the eastern tropical Pacific at the invitation of H.R. MacMillan, the addition of extensive local freshwater material by members of the B.C. Game Commission, and several exchanges with institutions in other parts of the world\\". The collection was transferred to the biology department in 1960 and moved to the Beaty Biodiversity Museum along with the Herbarium. Part of the Fish Collection The Fish Collection holds over 850,000 specimens, including whole fish stored in alcohol, skeletons, cleared and stained fish, and fish X-rays. It also has over 50,000 DNA and tissue samples. It is the third largest fish collection in Canada, with particular strengths in freshwater and nearshore marine species. Locations covered include Canada, the Aleutians, the Malay Archipelago, Mexico, the Galapagos Islands, Panama, and the Amazon River Basin. The collection has been used in conservation efforts, environmental assessments, and numerous research projects, particularly by the Native Fishes Research Group. It has also served as an educational resource in training some of Canada's leading fish biologists. Over 2,300 species from the Fish Collection are included in FishBase, a global fish relational database supported by a research consortium that includes the UBC Fisheries Centre. The museum's collection was the first to be indexed by FishBase. =Fossil Collection= Clam fossils Dr. Merton Yarwood Williams, co-founder of the UBC Geology Department, began the Fossil Collection in 1924 with an initial acquisition from mining engineer William John Sutton The collection was exhibited in the Geological Sciences Centre beginning in 1971 and was curated by Joe Nagel. However, due to financial constraints the exhibit was closed in 1995. The collection became part of the holdings of the Pacific Museum of the Earth in 2003, but is being housed in the Beaty Biodiversity Museum during its recataloguing process. The Fossil Collection comprises over 20,000 items. Highlights of the collection include its stromatolites (rock formations consisting of blue-green algae dating back 500 million years - some of the oldest extant fossils) and examples of the Burgess Shale. In 2018, the museum added 3 casts of dinosaur trackways from Peace Region area of British Columbia to its permanent exhibitions. Reception The museum's blue whale exhibit was included in Scout Magazines list of \\"1,000 Cool Things about Vancouver\\". The Globe and Mail called the whale \\"an inescapable presence\\" for museum visitors. The museum was selected by Georgia Straight as among the \\"Best of Vancouver\\" for 2013; it was listed as \\"Best Collection of Weird Things in Drawers\\". The newspaper had previously featured the museum's blue whale exhibit.

President Herbert Hoover appointed her to the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection in 1929. During World War II, she organized the Red Cross' first black women's chapter of \\"Gray Ladies.\\" When Congress merged the NCCPT with the National PTA in 1970, Butler was posthumously recognized as one of the organization's founders. Today, Butler is considered a co-founder of the National Parent-Teacher Association. Early life Selena Sloan Butler, from an 1899 publication. Butler was born in Thomasville, Georgia to William Sloan and Winnie Williams on January 4, around 1872, just seven years after slavery was abolished. Her father was white, and her mother was of mixed descent, half Indian and half African-American. She started life with her mother and sister but without her father's presence, although she did receive his monetary support. She attended a missionary-operated elementary school in Thomas County and studied at Spelman Seminary (later Spelman College). At the age of sixteen Butler graduated from Spelman in 1888 (with a high school diploma) and began her teaching career in Atlanta. She later became a member of the Eta Sigma chapter of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority. She married Henry Rutherford Butler, a prominent African American doctor in Atlanta who had studied medicine at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The couple had one son, Henry Jr. As their son, Henry, Jr., approached school age, Selena looked for a preschool. Finding none in her neighborhood or in any black neighborhood in the city, she decided to start a kindergarten in her home. Career When Henry entered the Yonge Street Elementary School, Selena began seeking ways to help parents get involved in their children‚Äôs education. Enlisting support from other parents, in 1911, Butler founded the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers Association (NCCPT) at Yonge Street Elementary School; the first parent-teacher association for African Americans in the United States. In 1919, she formed a statewide parent-teacher association in Georgia. What began as a local venture grew into a nationally recognized organization. Butler's dedication to children and families stirred her to reach out to parents on a national level. She wrote several letters encouraging parents and teachers of color to form a union with the primary purpose of uniting home and school into a planned program for child welfare. Her letters stimulated interest in the parent-teacher movement and her own state Georgia became the first to organize. By 1926, Mrs. Butler aroused sufficient interest and issued the first call for a national convention. To this call, four states responded and sent delegates. During that same year, the once statewide parent-teacher association became the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers Association. The NCCPT was modeled closely after its white only counterpart, the National Congress of Parents and Teachers (today, the National Parent-Teacher Association). Butler dedicated her life to forming an organization which would have the same objectives as the National Congress of Parents and Teachers. The NCCPT and the Congress of Mothers worked closely with each other to improve the conditions in schools for all children, regardless of race, as well as for teachers. Presidential appointment Her efforts inspired President Herbert Hoover to appoint her to serve on his 1929 White House Conference on Child Health and Protection representing the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers and working on the Committee on The Infant and Pre-School Child, whose work contributed to the writing of the Children's Chapter. Between 1929 and 1930, she served on the president's Committee (presently, the White House Conference on Children and Youth) and would go on to lead the NCCPT for more than thirty years. Butler was active in her community not only as an educator but also as an organizer. She co-founded the Spelman College Alumnae Association, organized the Phyllis Wheatley Branch of the Atlanta YWCA, and was the first president of the Georgia Federation of Colored Women's Club. Burler's entire life was dedicated to service. She was also a delegate to the founding convention of the National Association of Colored Women; a member of the Georgia Commission on Interracial Cooperation; a member of the Chatauqua Circle of Atlanta; a member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, Gamma chapter, and the Order of the Eastern Star. =Later years= Following the death of her husband in 1931, Butler relocated to England where she worked in the Nursery School Association. Thereafter, she returned to the United States to live with her son and his wife in Arizona where she organized the first black women‚Äôs chapter of the Gray Ladies Corps. At the age of 92, Butler died of congestive heart failure on October 7, 1964, and was buried beside her husband in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta. A portrait of Butler is displayed in the Georgia State Capitol building. In 1966, the City of Atlanta dedicated the Selena Sloan Butler Park in her honor. In 1970, Butler was named a founder of the National Parent-Teacher Association. In 1995, Butler was posthumously inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement Hall of Honorees.

Siracusano, 563 U.S. 27 (2011), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding whether a plaintiff can state a claim for securities fraud under ¬ß10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß78j(b), and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR ¬ß240.10b-5 (2010), based on a pharmaceutical company's failure to disclose reports of adverse events associated with a product if the reports do not find statistically significant evidence that the adverse effects may be caused by the use of the product. In a 9‚Äì0 opinion delivered by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Court affirmed the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's ruling that the respondents, plaintiffs in a securities fraud class action against Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., and three Matrixx executives, had stated a claim under ¬ß10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  Parties  * Petitioners: Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., Carl Johnson, William Hemelt, and Timothy Clarot (collectively \\"Matrixx\\") * Respondents: James Siracusano and NECA-IBEW Pension Fund, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated who purchased Matrixx securities between October 22, 2003, and February 6, 2004  Background  Petitioner Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., is a pharmaceutical company that sells cold remedy products through its wholly owned subsidiary Zicam, LLC. One of Zicam's main products is Zicam Cold Remedy (Zicam), which is produced in the form of a nasal spray or gel containing the active ingredient zinc gluconate. On April 27, 2004, respondents brought a class action suit against petitioners, alleging that petitioners violated ¬ß10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 by failing to disclose reports that Zicam could cause anosmia, or loss of the sense of smell. Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss respondents' complaint for failure to state a claim. The District Court for the District of Arizona granted the motion without prejudice, reasoning that the allegation of user complaints were neither material nor statistically significant, and that respondents failed to allege scienter. Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which issued a decision on October 28, 2009, to reverse and remand the judgement of the District Court. On March 23, 2010, petitioners filed their petition for a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit with the United States Supreme Court.On Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (2010-03-23).

Erik Olson, a partner at the Morrison & Foerster law firm in San Francisco which filed an amicus brief on behalf of BayBio, said that the court's ruling risks leaving companies without a clear guideline for deciding when they need to disclose adverse events.

Sebastian of Heusenstamm () (16 March 1508 ‚Äì 18 March 1555) was the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz from 1545 to 1555. Biography Sebastian of Heusenstamm was born in Frankfurt on March 16, 1508. He was ordained as a priest in Mainz on October 6, 1531. Following the death of Albert of Mainz, the cathedral chapter of Mainz Cathedral elected Sebastian to be the new Archbishop of Mainz on October 20, 1545. Pope Paul III confirmed his appointment on January 27, 1546, and he was consecrated as a bishop by Melchior Zobel von Giebelstadt, Bishop of W√ºrzburg, on May 2, 1546. The practice of canonical visitation had been re-established by the Council of Trent, so Sebastian conducted a visitation of the Archbishopric of Mainz, aimed at rooting out Protestant tendencies in the archbishopric. This visitation was largely carried out by Sebastian's auxiliary bishop, Michael Helding (later Bishop of Merseburg). Sebastian held a provincial synod on November 19, 1548 to launch the Counter-Reformation in Mainz. In 1551, along with John of Isenburg-Grenzau, Archbishop of Trier, he attended the Council of Trent, but the archbishops rushed home with the outbreak of the Second Margrave War in 1552. During the Second Margrave War, troops of Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach attacked Mainz in 1552, devastating the city. This convinced Sebastian that Charles V, Holy Roman Empire was unable to protect the ecclesiastical territories from the secular states surrounding them. He thus became a supporter of the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, although he died before the Peace of Augsburg was signed. Sebastian died in Eltville on March 18, 1555. He is buried in Mainz Cathedral.

Amnesty International considered her a prisoner of conscience. 8888 uprising and subsequent arrests Nilar Thein is from Yangon, Burma. She and her future husband, Kyaw Min Yu (better known as \\"Ko Jimmy\\"), participated in 1988's pro- democracy 8888 Uprising, opposing the continued rule of the military dictatorship State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). In 1990, she was imprisoned for two months for her participation in protests. In December 1996, she was arrested for organizing protests and sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which she served at Thayawaddy prison. She reported being abused and sexually harassed by prison staff during this sentence, stating that \\"under the prison chief, U Win Myint, prisoners sentenced for rape were kept next to the women‚Äôs building... Prison staff and these prisoners would come and peep at us while we took our baths.\\" She was released in 2003. In 2005, she married Kyaw Min Yu. At around the same time, she joined the newly formed 88 Generation Students Group. Role in 2007 protests In August 2007, anti- government protests (popularly known as the \\"Saffron Revolution\\" for the prominent involvement of Buddhist monks) broke out in Yangon in response to increasing fuel and commodity prices. As a part of the protests, Nilar Thein organized a march of roughly 500 people to protest government policies. When police began seeking the organizers of the protest, Nilar Thein went into hiding. Her husband had already been arrested on the night of 21 August and sent to Insein Prison. In May, Nilar Thein had given birth to a baby girl, Phyu Nay Kyi Min Yu, and when hiding with the infant became too difficult, she left the child with in-laws. She then evaded capture for a little more than a year, changing locations and cell phone numbers frequently to avoid detection; she told a reporter that at one point in this period she escaped arrest in a rickshaw taxi. In March 2008, People in Need awarded Nilar Thein, along with political prisoners Su Su Nway and Phyu Phyu Thin, the Homo Homini Award. On 19 June 2008, Nilar Thein published an editorial in the English-language Thai newspaper The Nation, protesting the Burmese government's treatment of women and children. In it, she asks, \\"When the government itself is the abuser of human rights and the perpetrator of rape and other forms of gender-based violence, who will protect the victims? Who will end their tragedy? Who will secure the joyful reunion of mothers with their children?\\" Arrest, trial, and imprisonment On 10 September 2008, Nilar Thein was arrested on her way to visit the mother of another political prisoner, Ant Bwe Kyaw, in Yangon. On 11 November, she and her husband were convicted along with fellow 88 Generation Students Group members Htay Kywe, Mie Mie, and ten other activists on four counts of \\"illegally using electronic media\\" and one count of \\"forming an illegal organization\\". At that time, all fourteen were serving 65-year sentences at Thayet prison. In January 2009, her family heard secondhand information that she had developed a peptic ulcer and were concerned that her health might be deteriorating. In December 2010, Nilar Thein's family reported that prison officials had barred them from seeing her, even to bring Nilar Thein's child for a visit. Nilar Thein responded with a hunger strike. Release Nilar Thein and Ko Jimmy were released on 13 January 2012 in a mass presidential pardon of political prisoners. Speaking from outside the prison on the day of her release, she told The Irrawaddy that \\"I‚Äôm happy, and I will be very happy to see my family. We will get involved in democratic reform with Auntie [Aung San Suu Kyi].\\" Rohingya genocide In September, 2017 -- at the height of the Rohingya genocide (the violent persecution of Myanmar's chiefly-Muslim minority, the Rohingya) -- Nilar Thein had reportedly been photographed escorted by, and assisting, a group of apparent Tatmadaw soldiers, while touring the conflict region, Myanmar's Rakhine state. She was subsequently among a group of 88 Generation Peace and Open Society activists appearing at a press conference, September 13, 2017, at which they issued a written statement that denied the version of events depicted in prominent international media, and in which one of the group's principal figures issued a statement essentially siding with Myanmar's civilian government in its harsh treatment of the Rohingya community.\\"Activists championed by rights groups have history of anti-Rohingya messaging,\\" May 24, 2020, Frontier Myanmar, retrieved June 1, 2020\\"88 Generation Peace and Open Society Stand by Govt on Rakhine,\\" September 13, 2017, The Irrawaddy, retrieved June 1, 2020 References External links * Profile at Assistance Association for Political Prisoners 1972 births Living people People from Yangon Burmese Theravada Buddhists Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Myanmar Burmese democracy activists Burmese prisoners and detainees ","title":"Nilar Thein"},{"id":"31518674","text":"St John the Evangelist Church is one of four parish churches in the town of Newbury in the English county of Berkshire.

Early life Irene Schroeder (n√©e Crawford) was born in 1909 in Benwood, West Virginia. At the age of 15, she married Homer Shrader, and they had a son, Donnie, a year later. She soon left Homer and became a waitress in Wheeling, West Virginia. There, she met Walter Glenn Dague, who became her lover. Shootout in Butler, Pennsylvania On December 27. 1929, she and Dague as well as her older brother, Tom Crawford, were involved in a grocery store robbery in Butler, Pennsylvania. While escaping the scene of the crime, they were stopped by two police officers, Brady Paul and Ernest Moore. A shootout ensued. Paul was fatally shot, and Moore was wounded. Shrader, Crawford, and Dague all escaped and went into hiding, leaving Irene's four-year-old son, who had been in the car at the time, with a family member.

Design Developed during the Crimean War as an enlarged version of W. H. Walker's Albacore class, the Algerines were an acknowledgement that gunboats designed for coastal operations would inevitably be called upon to act in a cruising role, both in shallow and in deeper water. Their increased size gave them much improved accommodation, and in general they were effective vessels. =Armament= As built, they were armed with one 68-pounder (87cwt) muzzle- loading smoothbore gun and two 24-pounder howitzers. =Propulsion= Jaseur was fitted with a 2-cylinder horizontal direct-acting single-expansion steam engine manufactured by Maudslay, Sons & Field. This engine drove a single screw, which for the first time in a gunboat was provided with a hoisting mechanism; this ensured a better performance under sail than previous classes.Preston (2007) p.155 Her engine developed 80 nominal horsepower (a designed indicated horsepower of ). The design speed under steam was . =Rig= Fitted at first with a simple schooner rig (often known as a \\"gunboat rig\\" in the Royal Navy), the use of these vessels as cruisers encouraged commanding officers on far-flung stations to augment their sail area by fitting topmasts and yards, making them barquentines. Construction Ordered on 22 September 1856, she was laid down at the Blackwall Yard premises of R & H Green. She was launched on 7 March 1857, and her first (and only) commanding officer, Lieutenant John Binney Scott joined on 28 July 1857. She commissioned on 5 September 1857 for the North America and West Indies station. Operational service Service on the North America and West Indies station in the late 1850s involved deterring the slave trade on the western side of the Atlantic. Although there was considerable activity in chasing and examining potential slavers, it was rare to find a vessel engaged in the slave trade which could be legally detained. Jaseur had already boarded 3 vessels during March 1858 when the Commodore at Jamaica directed that his ships (Styx, Basilisk, Jaseur, Jasper, Skipjack and Forward) were to \\"be kept actively employed in cruizing round Cuba for the suppression of the slave trade\\". She arrived in Havana in July 1858 for coal, departing the same day for Tampico. In October 1858, Jaseur and Kite assisted in the search for the American barque Parthian, which was reported to be in distress off Bermuda.

Taking place in a world of anthropomorphic coffee beans, the film tells the story of a bean assassin named Jack \\"Killer\\" Bean, who is sent to hunt down a crime boss, while he himself is hunted by mercenaries and the police. The film was preceded by two web shorts: \\"Killer Bean: The Interrogation\\" in 1996, and \\"Killer Bean 2.1: The Party\\" in 2000. In 2020, an animated series that continues the story of the film was announced and premiered on September 6, 2020. The movie has obtained a cult following online since 2019. Plot One night, at 2:43 AM, bean assassin Jack \\"Killer\\" Bean is having problems sleeping due to several gangsters holding a loud party in a nearby warehouse. He calls the gangsters' leader to turn down the music, but he refuses, so Killer Bean resumes to killing all the gangsters; their leader is later revealed to be the nephew of crime boss and drug lord Cappuccino. Shortly after, a police investigation led by Detective Cromwell occurs at the warehouse, which is known to be owned by Cappuccino. Vagan, a lieutenant who runs guns for Cappuccino, arrives at the warehouse, discovering the massacre, and leaves after being briefly questioned by Cromwell. That morning, Killer Bean is stopped from assassinating Cromwell (having seen him on the news) by a call from his boss, who warns him the warehouse shooting was reckless, and that only the \\"target\\" should be killed. Killer Bean assures him that the mission will succeed. In a Chinese restaurant, an assassin named Jet Bean receives a call from his boss sending him on a mission. The restaurant owner then forces him to pay the bill, but he refuses and leaves after beating the chef, who was told by the owner that Jet Bean insulted his food. At the drug headquarters, Cappuccino holds a meeting with his lieutenants, knocking two of them out the window when they annoy him, before Vagan appears and informs him of the warehouse shooting and his nephew's death, so Cappuccino sends Vagan to deal with Killer Bean. Meanwhile, Detective Cromwell analyzes the evidence at the warehouse and finds Killer Bean's name on the bullets, before locating another one of Cappuccino's warehouse, just as Killer Bean arrives there and encounters Vagan. After their fight ends in a draw, Vagan flees, while Killer Bean finds a note saying \\"Shadow Bean, you are too late.\\" Shortly after, Killer Bean is found in a bar across the street by Cromwell, who suggests working together to bring Cappuccino down, but Killer Bean refuses. Cromwell then finds the note referencing the \\"Shadow Beans\\" and calls his friend Harry, a police intelligence officer, who reveals the Shadow Beans were special assassins working for the Shadow Agency, a private organization that carried out secret government operations, but presumably disbanded years ago. That night, Killer Bean arrives at a third warehouse owned by Cappuccino, and kills both the gangsters he finds there, and several mercenaries hired by Vagan to kill him, but is ultimately knocked out by an explosion. He awakens tied up to a chair, being interrogated by Cappuccino as to why he is trying to kill him. After breaking free, Killer Bean reveals that he is not after Cappuccino, but rather after Vagan, prompting Cappucino to fire him, only to get shot in retaliation. Vagan is revealed to be a former Shadow Bean code-named \\"Dark Bean\\" who betrayed the Shadow Agency and stole their database. In response to Killer Bean's accusations, Vagan reveals the Agency had degenerated into simply guns for hire, and that he chose to work for Cappuccino instead, so that he could use his knowledge on the gun trade to continue fighting crime, independent from the corrupt Agency. Killer Bean can't bring himself to believe Vagan, and ultimately kills him, not before he warns him that the Agency will now come after him as well. Detective Cromwell, who witnessed the entire ordeal from afar, arrives with police reinforcements, and Killer Bean allows himself to be arrested, believing that only the police can protect him from the Agency. Shortly after, Jet Bean, sent by the Agency to kill Killer Bean, arrives at the warehouse and learns from a police officer that he was arrested. Jet Bean then allows himself to be arrested by beating an officer who mocked his Asian accent, and proceeds to kill everyone at the police station standing in his way to Killer Bean (save for Cromwell, who left earlier). After a final fight, Killer Bean prevails over Jet Bean, mortally shooting him. As he leaves, Killer Bean is called by his boss to come and \\"talk things over\\". He replies that will come, but not for talk, and drives off with a police van full of weapons. Voice cast * Vegas J. Jenkins as Jack \\"Killer\\" Bean. He is an anthropomorphic coffee bean and veteran assassin working for the Shadow Agency as a Shadow Bean, until learning of their true nature.

Production The concept for Killer Bean came in a short produced by Jeff Lew in the late 1990s entitled \\"Killer Bean: The Interrogation\\", which was later called \\"Killer Bean 1\\". Jeff Lew intended this short only to teach himself animation, and it only received about 3000 hits. After practicing animation for about 2 years, Lew started work on \\"Killer Bean 2.1: The Party\\", a 7-minute short. \\"Killer Bean 2\\" took about 3 years to create, and was released on iFilm in 2000. In about 6 months, it received about a million views, which was significant before YouTube. A later edit, \\"Killer Bean 2.1\\", was uploaded to YouTube in 2009. Killer Bean 2.1 has since gained more than 4 million views on YouTube since its initial upload in 2009. After receiving various calls from movie producers that never developed, Lew decided to make a full feature film himself. The first rough draft of the screen play took about 5 months. Previsualization took about one and a half years. One mistake Lew regretted was not making the concept art before previz, which meant that many of the previz shots could not be reused for final animation. Lew then posted an ad on Craigslist for voices, and auditioned about 20 people and cast four. The concept artist for the characters was Von Caberte. By July 2005, all preproduction was completed. The film took about five years to create, with approximately one and half years in pre-production and three years in animation. Killer Bean Forever had approximately 1000 animated shots. Generally, animators are given 1‚Äì4 weeks to complete one shot, and thus to create 1000 shots would have taken 20 years. Lew used an inexpensive 2D motion capture system to speed up animation, primarily with lip-sync. During this time, Lew also worked as an animator on major Hollywood productions including The Matrix Reloaded. Release In 2008, the worldwide rights to Killer Bean Forever were acquired by Cinema Management Group. That same year, the film was screened for buyers at the Toronto Film Festival. The film was released on DVD in the United States on July 14, 2009, and was released on Blu-ray in Germany in September 2010. In May 2018, the film was officially uploaded to YouTube in its entirety in 4K resolution, gaining over 19 million views as of 2020. Reception Scott McDanel of RMU Sentry Media called the film \\"an absolute dumpster fire,\\" but wrote that he would \\"still highly recommend it as a 'it's-so-bad-it's-good' flick.\\" The movie was officially uploaded to YouTube by Jeff Lew in May 2018, where it has since garnered 19 million views. This significantly contributed to the movie's cult following, causing moments and references of the film to become a meme. Earlier shorts: The Killer Bean 1 & 2 The first short, \\"The Killer Bean: The Interrogation\\", was released in 1996. The short features Killer Bean captured by mercenaries who interrogate him. The second short, \\"The Killer Bean 2: The Party\\", was released in August 8, 2000. The short is about Killer Bean being annoyed by the loud music at a nearby party held by some gangsters. When they refuse to turn it down, Killer Bean arrives to do it himself, but the gangsters won't go down without a fight. A third short, \\"The Killer Bean 3: Forever\\", was originally intended to release in 2002, but was scrapped in favor of the movie Killer Bean Forever. The trailer featured Killer Bean on a roof, breathing in, and breathing out. 2020 web series In January 2020, The Killer Bean Channel posted a picture on YouTube community revealing Killer Bean's return and will have a 10+ episode series, although it has been delayed since late February. The Twitter account of Killer Bean claimed that YouTubers and fans will voice act the characters in the mini- series. On May 10, the first teaser of the miniseries was released to the Killer Bean Channel. On May 10, 2020, The Return of Killer Bean, a teaser for what could come in the new series, was released onto YouTube. \\"The Return of Killer Bean\\" was released as a teaser for the upcoming 2020 series in 4K. The short features Killer Bean (Jeff Lew) attacking a group of mercenaries, but when the last surviving bean (Christopher Giersz) threatens to shoot a hole through his car door, just like he did with his mother's, Killer Bean attempts to reason with him. Claiming that the mercenary has some personal problems, Killer Bean lets him take his car and throws him the keys. The last bean tries to find the keys in some trash bags, when he finds them, the keys are actually an explosive device. The explosion throws the mercenary into a garbage can, though he survives, before Killer Bean leaves in his car. On September 6, 2020, the first episode was released,https://www.youtube.com/watch/BltgkVqmQS8 featuring Twitch streamer and popular Youtuber Cr1TiKaL, aka penguinz0, as Kessler. Mobile game In 2012, a mobile game, Killer Bean: Unleashed, was released for Android and iOS. The game was about Killer Bean who is on the run from mercenaries while hunting the Shadow Agency's top shadow bean.

(April 20, 1945 ‚Äì May 12, 2015) was an American singer-songwriter who was briefly promoted as a major star in the early 1960s and later attracted a cult following with his 1965 album Songs of Protest and Anti-Protest, issued under the name Chris Lucey. The album's dark lyrics and sophisticated arrangements led its advocates to note similarities with Love's 1967 album Forever Changes. For decades, little was known about Jameson or his origins, and he was more famous for engaging in public disturbances and suicide attempts than his music. Starting his career in 1963, Jameson was hyped as the next major pop event in an elaborate promotional campaign that ran in the magazines Billboard and Cashbox. For the next five years, he released 11 singles across eight different American and British record labels. At one point, he was the opening live act for the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, and Chubby Checker, and also declined an offer to join the Monkees. From the mid 1960s to early 1970s, Jameson was active in Los Angeles underground music circles, working with musicians such as Frank Zappa and members of Crazy Horse. During this period, he participated in the Sunset Strip riots, appeared as a subject in the 1967 documentary Mondo Hollywood, and garnered a reputation as someone who had ruined his chances at success. After Songs of Protest and Anti-Protest, he released only two more albums: Color Him In (1967), a collaboration with Curt Boettcher, and Working (1969), an album of cover songs. Jameson's life was affected by personal misfortune, followed by alcoholism and criminal activity. He grew increasingly frustrated and disillusioned with the music industry, alleging that his managers and employers failed to ensure him financial compensation and royalties, and that some companies had illegally claimed the intellectual property rights to his songs. For much of the 1970s he was institutionalized or homeless, but eventually achieved sobriety. After 1985, he left the music business completely, and was rumored to be dead for many years. In 2002, Songs of Protest and Anti-Protest was reissued without Jameson's knowledge, and in response, he resurfaced in 2007 with a series of autobiographical blog posts and YouTube videos, which he maintained until his death in 2015. Childhood Bobby Jameson was born in Geneva, Illinois, but by the age of 10 was living with his mother, stepfather and brother in Tucson, Arizona. He and his brother began to learn guitar and entered talent contests, before his parents divorced. The brothers and their mother then lived in various small towns in Arizona, before moving to Glendale, California in 1962. Music career =Early singles and promotion= Credited as Bobby James,Label shot of \\"Let's Surf\\". Accessed 17 April 2011 he made his first record, \\"Let's Surf\\", with Elliot Ingber on guitar, on the Jolum label in 1963. In 1964, while sharing a house in Hollywood with Danny Whitten, Billy Talbot, and Ralph Molina (later of Crazy Horse), Jameson met Tony Alamo, who became his manager and promised to make him a star. Alamo mounted a major promotional campaign in the music press, describing the 19-year-old Jameson as \\"The Star Of The Century\\" and \\"The World's Next Phenomenon\\". Jameson later wrote: > For some reason, that is still a mystery to me to this day, Tony just > started promoting me in Billboard and Cashbox magazine without ever telling > me he was going to do it. He just showed up one day in a coffee shop in > Hollywood with a copy of both publications and I was in them. We had no > contract, no agreement of any kind and no record.

The record became a regional hit in the Midwest and Canada, and as a result he opened shows for The Beach Boys and Chubby Checker, and appeared on American Bandstand. However, the follow-up, \\"Okey Fanokey Baby\\", was less successful, and Jameson wanted to get away from Alamo's increasingly manipulative behavior. As a friend of P.J. Proby, who had already achieved success in Britain, Jameson traveled to London, where Andrew Loog Oldham had expressed an interest in recording him. There, he recorded \\"All I Want Is My Baby\\", co-written by Oldham and Keith Richards and probably featuring session guitarist Jimmy Page, with a Jagger/Richards B-side, \\"Each and Every Day of the Year\\". After appearing on the TV show Ready Steady Go!, featuring his gimmick of wearing a glove on only one hand, he stayed in London and in 1965 recorded \\"Rum Pum\\" / \\"I Wanna Know\\", produced by Harry Robinson, for the Brit Records label set up by Chris Peers and Chris Blackwell. Again, however, it was unsuccessful and Jameson returned to Los Angeles. =Songs of Protest and Anti-Protest= After his return to California, Jameson was approached by Mira Records, a company established by Randy Wood, previously of Vee-Jay Records. They had recorded an album, Songs of Protest and Anti- Protest, with another singer-songwriter, Chris Ducey, for release on their mid-price subsidiary Surrey label. The album sleeves had already been printed, with Ducey's name and the track titles, but with a photo showing Brian Jones. However, in the meantime Ducey had entered into another contract with a different company, which meant that Mira were unable to release Ducey's record. The label asked Jameson -- who at the time was \\"broke, homeless, and sleeping on people's couches\\" -- to write and record new songs to match Ducey's song titles, and arranged to have the record sleeves overprinted so that the name \\"Ducey\\" would appear as \\"Lucey\\". Within two weeks, Jameson wrote the songs, and recorded them with producer Marshall Leib (previously a member of The Teddy Bears with his friend Phil Spector). The record was released without fanfare, with Jameson credited as songwriter, but without any agreement over his legal rights to the recordings. It was later issued on the Joy label in the UK under Jameson's own name, and the title Too Many Mornings. Although Songs of Protest and Anti-Protest was not promoted commercially, and was ignored when first released in late 1965, over the years it acquired a strong reputation. According to Dean McFarlane at Allmusic: > This sought after psychedelic pop gem... [is] often compared to Love's > Forever Changes, in that it is an intricate exploration of sophisticated > arrangements and bleak and twisted lyricism... [It] may have been a little > too courageous for its time, tackling blues, exotic - almost lounge > arrangements and pure pop psychedelia.

Richie Unterberger wrote: > There aren't many albums of the time that bear an unmistakable Love > similarity, but Songs of Protest and Anti-Protest is one of them. Both the > vocals and songwriting bear strong recollections of early Arthur Lee, with > the melodic but wistful folk-rock chord changes, occasional Latin jazz > tempos, occasional gruff folk-blues downbeat atmosphere, probing yet vague > lyrics, and oddball production. Part of its appeal to record collectors was its obscurity and that little was known about its creator. Jameson himself commented: \\"[The album] was a throw away album when it was created. Like it or not, that is a fact. It has, in recent years, taken on a life of its own and for that I am grateful, but it needs to be viewed in real context, to see how it has risen on its own merit to a position it never held when it was created.\\" =\\"Vietnam\\" and Mondo Hollywood= Early in 1966, Jameson recorded (under his own name) a single for the Mira label, \\"Vietnam\\" / \\"Metropolitan Man\\", on which he was backed by members of The Leaves, who had recorded Jameson's song \\"Girl from the East\\" on their own album, Hey Joe. In 2010, writer Jon Savage described \\"Vietnam\\" as \\"an all-time garage-punk classic ‚Äì a vehement statement against a war that, by early 1966, was already spiralling out of control.\\" However, at the time the record was barely promoted and did not receive airplay because, according to Jameson, its sentiments were seen as too contentious, and Jameson himself had a reputation as someone who had blown his chances of success. In addition to The Leaves, and playing drums on the recording session for \\"Vietnam\\" was the elusive musician Don Conka from the group Love.AllMusic - Don Conka, Artist Biography by Eugene ChadbourneNight Flight, May 20, 2015 - Remembering ‚ÄúMondo Hollywood‚Äù‚Äòs Bobby Jameson By Bryan Thomas Jameson was featured, along with many others, in the experimental 1967 documentary movie Mondo Hollywood, directed by Robert Carl Cohen, in which he talked about his beliefs and career, and was filmed with his then-girlfriend Gail Sloatman (later the wife of Frank Zappa) and recording \\"Metropolitan Man\\". He also made a brief uncredited cameo in the 1967 CBS documentary Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution. =Zappa, Color Him In, and Working!= Verve Records signed Jameson for an album based on his connections with Frank Zappa (pictured in 1973). Later in 1966, Jameson recorded two singles for the Penthouse label, another subsidiary of Mira. Both the singles, \\"Reconsider Baby\\" and \\"Gotta Find My Roogalator\\", were arranged and produced by an uncredited Frank Zappa, who also played guitar, with other musicians including Carol Kaye and Larry Knechtel. Jameson also recorded a single, \\"All Alone\\", for Current Records. However, none of the records were commercially successful. At about the same time, he was considered for one of the roles in The Monkees, but decided not to pursue the opportunity, and for a time became actively involved in anti-Vietnam War protests in Los Angeles. One report at the time stated that \\"his outspokenness and active participation in the recent Sunset Strip riots has acquired him the honorary title 'Mayor of the Sunset Strip'\\". He began working with arranger and producer Curt Boettcher on an album, Color Him In. The album, credited simply to Jameson, was released in early 1967 by Verve Records as a result of Jameson's connections with Zappa. Two singles on the Verve label, \\"New Age\\" and \\"Right By My Side\\", followed that year. However, Verve were unwilling to release Jameson's later recordings, and he left the label in 1968. By this time, Jameson was making increasing use of LSD, other drugs and alcohol, and was arrested 27 times, being charged at one point with assaulting a police officer. In 1968, he recorded his last album, Working!, for the small GRT label, with musicians including James Burton, Jerry Scheff and Red Rhodes. =Personal struggles= Increasingly, Jameson became frustrated and disillusioned with the fact that he had never received any financial rewards from his music. He was hospitalized several times after drug overdoses and other suicide attempts, detailed in his later blog, and was pronounced dead on two occasions. He also intermittently made unreleased recordings, with Jesse Ed Davis, Ben Benay and others, and in 1972 featured in an article about his life and personal troubles in Rolling Stone magazine. For much of the 1970s he was either institutionalized, or living on or close to the streets, and making several attempts to give up alcohol and drugs. He recorded several tracks for RCA in the late 1970s, but they were unreleased, aside from one single issued as Robert Parker Jameson. In 1985, he left the music business completely. Final years and death For the next twenty years, he lived quietly with his mother in San Luis Obispo County, California, overcoming his alcoholism. In 2003, he discovered that Songs of Protest and Anti-Protest had been released on CD without his knowledge. Before then, he was rumored to be dead by many who knew him. He was brought back to the public eye by music historian Steve Stanley, who conducted a private investigation into Jameson's whereabouts. In 2007, Jameson started a blog, detailing his life and his continuing attempts to seek some financial recompense for his earlier recordings.
