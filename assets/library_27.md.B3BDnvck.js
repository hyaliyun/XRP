After the birth of her two sons, she began her clinical training between 1993 and 2002 at Victoria General Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia. At Berkeley, she focused on neural control of behavioral rhythms in animal models and was known during the 1980s for her work on male golden hamsters, attempting to explain their neural control of rhythms of daily sexual behavior. As well, she examined their circadian rhythms.  Interests  One of Gail‚Äôs current projects is to understand how the brain works after a stroke. She studied how a stroke can affect fatigue levels and language abilities. Other areas of research include short-term memory, cognitive rehabilitation, and the role of the frontal lobes in different tasks. She employed techniques such as behavioral testing and functional imaging.  Awards  Gail received the Clinical Research Scholar Award from the Faculty of Medicine.

Geography Broadmoor was defined in 1901 as a plain in Colorado Springs. The neighborhood extends beyond the plain along the northern spur of the Cheyenne Mountain massif and into the valley of Cheyenne Creek, which has its source at the adjacent North Cheyenne Ca√±on Park's confluence of South Cheyenne Creek and North Cheyenne Creek. Adjacent neighborhoods are Upper and Lower Skyway (north), Ivywild (northeast), Stratton Meadows (east), and Neal Ranch (south). History Broadmoor Casino, 1891 In the 1880s, Willie Wilcox and James Pourtales purchased the Broodmoor Dairy. Wilcox was a wealthy man who came to Colorado for his health and Pourtales was a Prussian Count. They dammed part of Cheyenne Creek that ran through the dairy's property to create a man-made lake to make a more enticing environment for a hotel and casino that they were building. The city of Colorado Springs, in an effort to supplement the water needed to be supplied for the town, \\"continued to steal water\\". In a legal suit, Wilcox and Pourtales were deemed the water rights holder. Their company went bankrupt and was reorganized as the Broadmoor Land and Investment Company. The London and New York Investment Company bought their organization in 1893 and in 1897 completed the construction of the lake and casino, which was formally landscaped, had grounds for polo and golf games, pigeon shooting, and gambling. The resort and casino were fashioned for wealthy guests and the buildings had European architecture. The Broadmoor Dairy was owned by Dr. Robert M. Smith in 1898. In 1898, Broadmoor was southwest of the city limit and was about long. Piedmont was south of the east end of Broadmoor. The Broadmoor Casino and the Cheyenne Mountain Country Club were on the Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway Cheyenne Canon street car line in 1898. In 1916, Broadmoor was described as fashionable suburb with many beautiful mansions on Cheyenne Road between Lake and Circle. Colorado Springs Gun Club had several locations, one of which was in Broadmoor at 7th and Vine. The Myron Stratton Home was in Broadmoor in 1916. The Broadmoor resort had an electric light plant and greenhouse on Lake Circle. The Broadmoor, including its Broadmoor Golf Club, opened in 1918. In 1919, aircraft flights began to and from the hotel's neighboring fields. Broadmoor was one of five Colorado Springs suburbs annexed into Colorado Springs in 1980. The others were Ivywild, Skyway, Cheyenne Canon, and Stratton Meadows. The annexation added and 20,000 people to the city's total area and population. The Colorado Supreme Court upheld the annexation in 1982.

He was the first translator of the Bible from Latin into Italian. Life Nicol√≤ (Nicholas) Malermi (Malerba, Manerba) was born in Venice about 1422. He entered the Camaldolese Order in about 1470, quite late in his life, when he was 48 years old, and translated the Bible the next year, in the hermitage of San Matteo, on a little island near Murano in the Venetian lagoon. In 1477 he was appointed abbot of S. Michele di Lemo (San Michele above Lim), in Istria, which was then under Venetian rule. (This is the Istria just south of Trieste, which is now part of Croatia.) This monastery was between Parenzo and Rovigno, near Klostar, above the Canale di Leme and had been placed under the primacy of S. Michele di Murano in 1394. In 1480, Malermi was living in the Camaldolese monastery in Classe, near Ravenna, which was also under Venetian rule. The following year, the year of his death, he returned to Venice and became the superior of San Michele in Murano (San Michele in Isola). \\"Accademia patavina di scienze, lettere ed arti, Atti e memorie, Volume 21, 1905, pp. 240-41\\" The greatest accomplishment of Malermi was in 1471, his translation of the Bible, the so-called Malermi Bible, including the OT deuterocanonical books. It was the first printed translation of the Bible in Italian, based on the Latin text. The author (and his collaborators, Lorenzo da Venezia and Girolamo Squarciafico) completed the translation in eight months, in some cases using and adapting some previous fourteenth-century translations, even if at the expense of literary quality.Treccani.it Malermi also wrote a history (now lost) of the Murano monastery and translated into Italian The Lives of All Saints (some composed by Malermi, some in collaboration with Girolamo Squarciafico; Venice, 1475). Malermi died in 1481 in Venice. An 18th-century portrait of Malermi is at the Biblioteca Classense in Ravenna. There is digital version of his Bible, from the 1490 edition of Venice preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, England (Douce 244): Malermi Bible 1490 Venice.

He was eventually killed by Li Keyong for speaking ill of the already deceased Li Cunxiao, with whom he did not get along. Biography Kang Junli was from a powerful family in Yuzhou (ËîöÂ∑û; in modern Yu County, Hebei) near Tang Dynasty's northern border. Some time in the 870s, he was serving as an assistant captain () under Duan Wenchu (), the Yunzhou (Èõ≤Â∑û; modern Datong, Shanxi) defense commissioner (). At that time the Tang Dynasty was overran by bandits, and Duan did not treat his soldiers well, even reducing their salaries. In 878, Kang, as well as Xue Zhiqin (), Cheng Huaixin (), Wang Xingshen () and Li Cunzhang plotted with Li Jinzhong (), Yunzhou's Shatuo armed commander (), to join Li Keyong. Kang was sent to Yuzhou to persuade Li Keyong to mutiny. When Li Keyong expressed he needed to report this to his father Li Guochang in Zhenwu Circuit (ÊåØÊ≠¶, headquartered in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), Kang uttered: \\"Now that the secret is out, delays may bring trouble. How could (we) afford the time to report this to (someone) thousands of li away?\\" Li Keyong then agreed to act, resulting in the overthrow and execution of Duan. In 888, Kang was named the \\"southern bandit suppression commissioner\\" () and given 20,000 soldiers to assist Li Keyong's ally Li Hanzhi recover his former territory Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ; headquartered in modern Luoyang, Henan). Li Cunxiao, Xue Atan (), Shi Yan (), An Quanjun () and An Xiuxiu () were under his command. They were defeated by Zhu Quanzhong's forces and withdrew after An Xiuxiu fled. In 890, the imperial court declared war on Li Keyong. Li Keyong's brother Li Kegong () was killed by a subordinate in Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), who then surrendered to Zhu. Li Keyong then sent Kang and Li Cunxiao to surround the Zhaoyi capital of Luzhou (). Kang was on good terms with Li Cunxin, whose relationship with adoptive brother Li Cunxiao was sour at best. After the defeat of the imperial court and the recapture of Luzhou, Kang was named the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit, but Li Cunxiao believed he deserved the post more and went into a jealous rage. In 893, Li Cunxiao rebelled in Xingzhou (ÈÇ¢Â∑û; in modern Xingtai, Hebei), prompting Li Keyong to send Kang in a counterattack. Kang performed well in the campaign and was promoted to inspecting grand-guardian (). In spring 894, Li Cunxiao was captured and begged for mercy, claiming that he rebelled only because of Li Cunxin's false accusations. Li Keyong valued Li Cunxiao and wanted to spare his life. Even as he sentenced Li Cunxiao to death, he believed that other generals would beg on Li Cunxiao's behalf, but nobody did. After Li Cunxiao's death, Li Keyong became very depressed. Later that year, during a banquet in Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ; modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Li Keyong happened to mention Li Cunxiao during a conversation and cried uncontrollably. Kang responded by insulting Li Cunxiao's character. Furious, Li Keyong drew his sword and seriously injured Kang, also ordering his imprisonment. Kang was already dead when Li Keyong decided to release him. In fiction In the Yuan Dynasty play \\"A Grieving Lady Deng Painfully Laments Cunxiao\\" () by Guan Hanqing, which was translated as \\"Death of the Winged-Tiger General\\" by Yang Hsien-yi and Gladys Yang in 1958, Kang Junli was along with Li Cunxin one of the antagonists who were blamed for Li Cunxiao's unjustified death. (Lady Deng was the name of Li Cunxiao's wife in the play.) In this fictional play, Kang and Li Cunxin had Li Cunxiao cruelly executed behind Li Keyong's back out of jealousy.

Ngawen (known locally as Candi Ngawen) is an 8th-century Buddhist temple compound in Magelang Regency, Central Java, Indonesia. Located in Ngawen village, Muntilan sub-district, to the east of Mendut temple or to the south of Muntilan town center. Ngawen temple compound consists of five temples, however today only one is successfully reconstructed. Ngawen is thought to be connected with the other three Buddhist temples nearby ‚Äî Mendut, Pawon and Borobudur ‚Äî all of which were built during the Sailendra dynasty (8th-9th centuries). According to the satellite map observation, the four temples; Borobudur, Pawon, Mendut and Ngawen are actually forming a straight line spanning west to east slightly tilted northeast with eastern end pointing to the peak of Mount Merapi. From the detail and style of its carving, this temple is estimated to be slightly older than Borobudur. The temple is notable for its exquisite statues of rampant lions on each corners of the temples. Since its discovery in 1874, the temple has suffered looting and artifact theft.  Architecture  The temple was made from andesite stone and built in typical Central Javanese candi temple architecture. The temple complex was built on site measures 3,556 square meter, sandwiched between a village and rice paddies. The temple complex consists of five temples creating a row of temples spanning north to south; two main temples and three perwara (ancillary) temples in between the main temples in alternating order. The temples are numbered according to their order from north to south; so temples no. 2 and 4 are larger main temples, while temples no. 1, 3 and 5 are ancillary smaller temples. Today, only northern main temple or temple number 2, was successfully reconstructed, the other four temples are still in ruins. The temples faces east and stands on a square base. The northern main temple measures 13 meters by 12 meters base and is 7 metres in height. On each corner of the main temples, stands some exquisite statues of lions in rampant position. These lions of Ngawen temple are quite a unique feature among candis of Central Java. While the walls of the base display kinnaras. The stairs are on the east side. On each side of the stairs and the top of the gates are adorned with carved Kala-Makara, commonly found in classic Javanese temples. On the top of inner portal there is a carving of deities in svargaloka beneath a Kala's head. The outer walls of Ngawen main temple is carved with niches adorned with kala's head and the heavenly scene. The niches are now empty, it probably once contains the statues of Bodhisattvas or taras. There is a headless stone statue of meditating Dhyani Buddha Ratnasambhava performing Varamudra stance inside the main square chamber. The roof section of is crowned with small ratnas pinnacles, however the upper parts of the roof is still missing, creating a gaping hole on top of the main chamber. The peculiar thing is the roof section was adorned with ratna and not a stupa. There are both Hindu and Buddhist symbolism founds in this temple. Ratna pinnacles are most commonly found in Hindu temples in Java. This led to suggestions that the temple was initially built as a Hindu temple, but later converted to a Buddhist temple during its expansion and renovation. Experts suggested that the five temples are dedicated to Five Dhyani Buddhas, the Buddhist guardian of directions. They are Amitabha the ruler of the West, Ratnasambhawa for the South, Akshobhya for the East, Vairocana for the Zenith and Amoghasiddhi for the North. However the last three statues have been lost from the Ngawen temples. History Candi Ngawen in 1929. Examination of the style of Ngawen architecture, symbolism and carving, suggests that the temple was built around late 8th-century, slightly older than Borobudur. The original name of this Buddhist shrine is uncertain. \\"Ngawen\\" literally derived from Old Javanese word awi which means \\"bamboo\\". The Karangtengah inscription, dated 824 CE mentioned that King Indra of Sailendra has built a sacred building named Venuvana which means \\"bamboo forest\\". Dutch archaeologist JG de Casparis has connected the temple mentioned in Karangtengah inscription with Mendut temple. However, another suggestion presented by Soekmono argued that the Karangtengah inscription was probably refer to the Ngawen temple instead, based upon the etymological link between the name Ngawen village and Venuvana, for both words contains reference to \\"bamboo\\". The temple's actual base was buried two metres beneath the current ground level, suggest that the temple was probably covered by Mount Merapi volcanic ejecta for over a thousand years. The local Javanese villagers has been aware of the temple's ruin presence since 19th-century. The first official observations were conducted by Dutch archeologist Holpermand in 1874. In 1911, Van Erp mentioned Ngawen temple in his commentary, that the temples were destroyed by a Mount Merapi eruption. PJ Perquin, another Dutch archeologist, studied Ngawen in 1925 and successfully restored one of the five temples; the northern main temple (temple No.2). The temple suffered looting in the 1970s when two statue heads were stolen. Other looting incidents were reported in 1999.

The tomb's marble was plundered during the Sikh era in 18th century for use at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The red sandstone mausoleum, along with the nearby tomb of Jahangir, tomb of Asif Khan, and Akbari Sarai, forms part of an ensemble of Mughal monuments in Lahore's Shahdara Bagh. Location The mausoleum is located in Shahdara Bagh, across the River Ravi from Lahore. The tomb is part of an ensemble of nearby monuments, including the Tomb of Jahangir, Akbari Sarai, as well as the tomb of Asif Khan. Nur Jahan's tomb was separated from the other monuments by open fields, which were later interrupted by construction of the Lahore- Peshawar Railway Line during the British era.  Background  Koranic verses inlaid in marble on the cenotaph Mehr-un-Nissa, bestowed with the title Nur Jahan, meaning \\"Light of the World,\\" was the fourth child of Asmat Begum and her husband Mirza Ghiyas Beg, who had both immigrated from Persia. She was first married at the age of 17 to a Persian adventurer named Sher Afghan Ali Quli Khan Istajlu, who was renowned for his brilliant military career, and from whom she bore a daughter, Ladli Begum before he died in 1607. Her father served the Mughal emperor Akbar, who bestowed him with the title of Itmat-ud- daulah (\\"Pillar of the State\\"), while her brother Asif Khan served her next husband, the Emperor Jahangir. Nur Jahan was the most powerful Mughal Empress. During her reign between 1611 and 1627, she effectively shaped the expanding Mughal Empire, and contributed towards religious causes and helped foster overseas trade. History Having survived Jahangir by 18 years, she died at the age of 68 years and much of the mausoleum was most probably constructed during her lifetime. The tomb took four years to complete at the cost of Rupees three lakhs. Following the ascent of Shah Jahan to the Mughal throne, she was provided a yearly allowance of 200,000 rupees. Given the poor state of relations between her and Shah Jahan, it is likely that she funded the construction of her tomb from her annual allowance. As with the Tomb of Asif Khan, Nur Jahan's tomb was stripped of its ornamental stones and marble during the occupation of Lahore by the army of Ranjit Singh. Much of the materials were used to decorated the Golden Temple in Amritsar, and it has been said that half the Golden Temple's splendour derives from marble plundered from Nur Jahan's shrine. The Shahdara ensemble of monuments, including the Nur Jahan tomb, suffered under British rule when a railway line was built between the tombs of Asif Khan and Nur Jahan. The tomb underwent minor repairs but is slated for major restoration.  Architecture  The tomb was built on a podium, in the takhtgah style in which the podium serves as the takht, or \\"throne.\\" With a platform measuring 158 square feet, the tomb is in the shape of a square and measures 124 feet on each side, and is 19.6 feet high. Minarets may previously have risen from the corners of the mausoleum, similar to the nearby Tomb of Jahangir. Exterior Unlike her father's tomb (tomb of I'timƒÅd-ud-Daulah), which was constructed in white marble, Nur Jahan's mausoleum is primarily clad in red sandstone, with a flat roofline similar to that of her husband's tomb. The exterior features 7 vaulted arches, which were covered with marble and wrought with flower mosaics in semi-precious stones. The central arch on each side protrudes out from the 3 flanking vaulted arches. Minute paneling was executed in intricate patterns and cornices are honeycomb shaped in several rooms. The inner floor is covered with marble and the outer platform with sandstone. The exterior, encased in red sandstone, was inlaid with floral motifs in addition to white, black and yellow marble. Turtle Interior Marble cenotaphs of Nur Jahan and her daughter Ladli Begum The central vaulted chamber of the tomb contains a marble platform with two cenotaphs, one that commemorates Nur Jahan and the other to commemorate her daughter, Ladli Begum. Built by Hakim Ajmal, Khan of Delhi in 1912, the original marble sarcophagus bears ornate workmanship and the name of Allah, in the same style and size as seen in the tombs of Jahangir and Asif Khan. On her tomb is inscribed an epitaph: \\"On the grave of this poor stranger, let there be neither lamp nor rose. Let neither butterfly‚Äôs wing burn nor nightingale sing\\". Gardens The tomb stands in the centre of a Persian-style Charbagh. The original garden no longer survives, but once included tulips, roses, and jasmine.

History Halperin graduated with a Ph.D in clinical psychology from University of New York in 1979. In 1980, Halperin completed a postdoctoral fellowship in psychopharmacology at the Schering- Plough pharmaceutical corporation. Following graduation he worked as a research associate at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. In 1984, he pursued a job at the department of psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. There he served as director of child psychology from 1984-1989. Halperin maintains a part-time affiliation at Mount Sinai School of Medicine as the director of disruptive behavioral disorders research team, while currently working full-time as a psychology professor at Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center. Halperin furthermore serves as the director of the development neuropsychology laboratory at Queens College. Halperin is a member of the Child Psychopathology and Developmental Disabilities Study Section of the National Institutes of Health and serves as a frequent referee for academic and funding agencies around the world. Research activity For the past three decades Halperin has been conducting neuroscientific research, focusing on neuropsychiatric disorders that emerge during childhood but persist throughout life. His approach to research includes integration of clinical, neuropsychological and neurobiological psychology. Halperin specifically focuses on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Currently, he focuses on non-medical interventions for children that are at risk for developing ADHD. As of 2013, he has developed a project out of Queens College called TEAMS (Training Executive Attention and Motor Skills). This specific approach suggests that old fashion childhood games and playing with family can improve executive functioning, working memory, and self-control in children with ADHD. Part of his research includes applying neuroimaging procedures to observe brain functioning in children with maladaptive behaviors who do and do not persist into adulthood.

Holders of A2 PLIDA certificate could be exempted from the test held by the Prefectures. With the certificate (B2 or C1 level, depending on university and subject), students can be enrolled into universities or schools without taking the mandatory Italian language examinations. Eligibility PLIDA tests can be taken only by those who are not native speakers of Italian. All candidates can take the test at the level they prefer, and it is not a pre-requisite that they have passed the tests at lower levels. Test The Dante Alighieri Society is the organiser of PLIDA tests, with the academic approval from the Sapienza University of Rome. The Certification test is designed on the principles of the communicative approach, based on real-life tasks so as to test the ability in four areas: listening, reading, writing and speaking. The examination lasts for a minimum of 100 minutes to a maximum of 190 minutes, depending on the level. There are tests of six levels, A1 to C2, set according to the levels in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. * A1: the ability to use familiar everyday expressions aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type and to ask and answer questions about personal details. At this level of competence, interaction with Italian speakers can take place provided the other person is prepared to help. * A2: the ability to communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on areas of most immediate relevance, such as personal and family description, shopping, local geography and employment. * B1: the ability to understand written and spoken texts on familiar matters. At this level, one is able to engage effectively in a conversation as a tourist, to express opinions and to give simple explanations. * B2: the competence in the language which is necessary in a traditional scholastic context (to register with school or universities), to pursue post-graduate learning (such as professional and training courses), as well as to prepare for work activities that involve interaction with the public. At this level, one can interact with Italian speakers fluently and spontaneously and use the language for work related activities in one‚Äôs own field. * C1: a strong confidence with the Italian language and culture, such that it can be used in all working environments (professional, commercial, industrial and administrative). One can understand and produce a wide range of demanding, longer texts and recognise implicit meanings in complex writings such as literary works. * C2: a high linguistic competence comparable to that possessed by an Italian cultured speaker and applicable in any and all professional settings. It is the level required to teach Italian as a foreign language and to qualify for professional assignments of a high degree. Results Tests are marked in terms of a maximum of thirty points. To pass the examination, the candidate has to obtain a minimum of 18/30 in every tested areas, namely, listening, reading, writing and speaking. A candidate who passes at least three of the four areas obtains a credit in the areas passed, and these three credits may be used in the next attempt in the failed area.

(1771). The principles of physiology. (4th ed., pp. I-467). London: C. and J. Adlard Printers. Johann August Unzer __TOC__ Life Johann August Unzer was born on April 27, 1727, in Halle an der Saale, to a family of medical practitioners. His brother Johann Christoph Unzer was a physician of royalty, and his father was also a notable physician.:de:Johann August Unzer At age twelve, he started to pursue his medical degree at the University of Halle,A History of Psychology Ideas and Context his hometown university. In his years at the university, he started exploring ideas such as emotion,http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830904418.html and also ideas regarding the central nervous system. There, Unzer worked under a professor named Georg Ernst Stahl. While still attending university, he defended Stahl's views on animism by publishing one of his first works called \\"Thoughts on the Influence of the Soul on its Body\\". In 1748 at the age of twenty one, he received his MD. In 1749, he went on to complete his dissertation entitled \\"De Nexu Metaphysices cum Medicina generatim\\" and continued to work into the next year. After he graduated and completed his dissertational work, he went on to practice medicine in Hamburg, Germany while still developing his theories. Around this time, he started to publish on neuro-metaphysical matters in the Hamburg Magazine. He continued to do this until 1759, when he published his own medical journal called \\"The Physician\\". In the following years, he published several books and articles ranging from zoology, \\"The Principles of Physiology\\", and afferent and efferent reflexes. He died on April 2, 1799 in Altona, Germany where he was living at the time. Work Zoology As time passed, he started to turn from a Stahlian animism perspective to a physiological perspective on animal and human life. He conducted research in the area of zoology, a field that focused on all aspects of the animal kingdom. Unzer published a book called Erste Gr√ºnde (\\"first reasons\\"), which was later renamed The Principles of Physiology of the Proper Animal Nature of the Animal Organism. He focused on comparing nerves and their relationship with motions in animals. From there, he classified three types of motions: those motions that are conscious and voluntary, those that are conscious but not voluntary, and those that are unconscious and involuntary. After decapitating several animals, he compared higher animals to lower ones, and suggested that lower creatures that had no brain react to neural stimulus rather than brain activity\\". Unzer concluded that animals are like living machines, and through these decapitation observational studies, made the case that the brain contained the soul: \\"He proceeded from the notion of the animal as a machine to state that some animals (beseelte Tiere) have a soul that (unbeseelte Tiere) have neither soul nor brain, and are instead moved by animal \\"forces\\"\\". His ideas later came to be known as physiological metaphysics. After some time, he went on to conduct research on reflexes. Reflexes One of Unzer‚Äôs main contributions to science was the introduction of afferent and efferent reflexes. At its most basic level, afferent reflexes are those that move inward from something external, making its way to the central nervous system. Efferent then is the opposite, where the central nervous system triggers a reflex in the muscles. Unzer himself explains afferent reflexes: \\"To the end that an impression is felt‚Ä¶the external impression will have no other reflex action in the animal machines than that which is capable in virtue of its purely animal force, which it reflects upon the motor nerves‚Ä¶\\". He also goes on to explain efferent reflexes: \\"If, on the other hand, the external impression be also felt, then the mind, according to its psychological laws, connects volitionally with it many other conceptions, the internal impressions of which can produce through the motor nerves such sentient actions as the unfelt external impression could not have developed at all, or, at least, not in combination with the will of the animal. An example of the afferent reflex would be the traditional Patellar Reflex, which is also called the knee jerk reflex. An example of the efferent reflex may be the sucking reflex babies have at birth. He used reflexes to validate the point that animals without developed brains lack strong motor skills: \\"...we find animals without brain and without any traces of the mind, to be capable of very few kinds of movements\\". Guillotine and Consciousness Another major contribution that Unzer made was his study of consciousness. There was the question of whether or not consciousness was a product of all neural activity, or just higher functioning. After the first person was beheaded by Joseph Ignace Guillotin‚Äôs contraption named after him, there was a curiosity about whether there was any form of consciousness after the head was severed from the body, and whether or not it was painless. People wondered if beheading actually did kill the person entirely, because the body of a criminal would sometimes convulse for some time after the person was \\"killed\\". Unzer was one of the first to confront this problem. Using what he had observed from animals and their reactions to beheading, he concluded that the same phenomena could be applied to human beings as well. He said that if a signal had nowhere to go (i.e. once it reached the place where the head was severed), it may travel back through an efferent pathway, causing the motion that the person would have performed if he or she were whole. However, he argued such actions are still reflexes, and do not require conscious activity, because the brain is needed for conscious activity to occur. Therefore, he concluded that if there was no conscious experience due to the neural impulse never reaching a brain, there was no pain as well.

While seemingly identical to normal fully perforated issues (which were printed on flat plate presses), coil waste stamps are distinguishable by their size: their designs are slightly wider or longer than normal because rotary press printing slightly stretches an image. The stamps removed from coil production in the late teens and early twenties were \\"discarded as unfit,\\" according to a report from a director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing \\"on account of narrow margins, too close perforations, and other reasons.\\" , a: p. 118; b: pp. 179-180 A notable example is a 1919 1¬¢ Washington stamp (Scott Catalogue #538). This, according to Max Johl, had \\"received the regulation one way [vertical] coil perforation while forming part of the long rolls of stamps printed on the rotary press. The coil perforating machines‚Ä¶fitted for perforating rolls of stamps could not be used to perforate sheets, so these [stamps] had to be perforated the other way (horizontally) on the regulation eleven gauge flat plate perforating machines.\\" The rarest coil waste issue from the Washington-Franklin series is another 1¬¢ Washington stamp produced in 1921 (Scott #544). Other Washington-Franklin examples include Scott #539-541. Stamps in a 'coil' configuration In 1923, during the production of the U. S. Fourth Bureau definitive series, four coil waste issues were made from short ends left over after the long printed rotary rolls had been cut into proper coil lengths (such as 500 or 1000 stamps). The excess production occurred in the coil versions of the 1¬¢ Franklin and 2¬¢ Washington stamps (Scott #597 and 599). One batch of each issue had been perforated 10 vertically, and those stamps were then perforated 11 horizontally to produce Scott #578 and 579; the remaining, smaller group of short ends had not been perforated, and these were finished with gauge 11 perforations on all sides (Scott #594 and 595). The rarest of the four is #594: a 1¬¢ Franklin stamp. Several extremely rare stamps from this period sometimes misidentified as coil waste was produced from the waste printing of sheet stamps. These include another 1¬¢ Franklin issue (Scott #596) and the perforated 11 rotary press Harding Memorial stamp (Scott #613).

Plot  At the Sunshine Cab Company's fleet garage in Manhattan, the cab drivers discover that the plate on the payphone is broken, allowing people to make free calls. Everyone, except Alex Rieger (Judd Hirsch), gets in line to make a call. Elaine Nardo (Marilu Henner) arrives and talks to Louie De Palma (Danny DeVito), the dispatcher. De Palma mistakes her for a customer and is extremely polite. However, when she tells him that she is a newly hired cab driver, Louie reverts to his usual abusive self. Elaine sits by longtime driver Alex and explains she is only working there part-time. Alex points out all of the other drivers who are also working there temporarily and observes that he is the only cab driver in the place. The other drivers then suggest that Alex make a call, even though he has stated there is nobody he wants to talk to. Eventually, he admits that he was considering calling his daughter Cathy. Everyone is surprised, as nobody knew he had a daughter. Alex reveals that he has not seen Cathy in 15 years, not since she was a baby. His ex-wife Phyllis remarried and moved to South America, telling Alex that if he really loved his daughter, he would not contact her, as that would create confusion. Alex admits that he now realizes that to be a mistake and decides to call after all. When Alex talks to Phyllis, he learns that Cathy is on her way to college in Portugal. As her plane will make a stopover in Miami, Alex decides to meet her there. Alex asks to borrow a cab for the weekend, but Louie refuses to give him one. Alex, fellow drivers Bobby Wheeler (Jeff Conaway) and Tony Banta (Tony Danza), Sunshine mechanic Latka Gravas (Andy Kaufman) and bystander John Burns (Randall Carver) take one anyway and drive non-stop to Miami. When Alex finds his daughter at Miami International Airport, he learns that Cathy has been told that he is living on a ranch in Montana and is considering running for the United States Senate. Alex then reveals his true situation. Cathy is curious about Alex, but is upset by his constantly referring to himself as her father, as she views her father to be the person who has raised her. When Alex reveals his memories of her first two years, however, she is touched. Just as she is about to board her plane, Cathy turns around and hugs Alex, and the two kiss briefly before she leaves. Some time later, the telephone's plate is repaired, ending the free phone calls. John arrives and announces that he has gotten his hack license and is now a Sunshine cab driver.

As a two- year-old he showed promise by winning one of his three races and finishing second in the Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year he won the Craven Stakes, but was well-beaten in the 2000 Guineas, Dante Stakes and Epsom Derby, before recording a 25/1 upset victory the Irish Derby at the Curragh Racecourse. He was retired to stud at the end of the year and had limited success as a sire of winners. Background Tyrnavos was a \\"very impressive looking\\" dark- coated bay horse with no white markings, bred in England by his owner George Cambanis. His dam Stilvi was bought by Cambanis as a yearling and became a top-class racehorse, winning the King George Stakes and Duke of York Stakes and an outstanding broodmare. Before Tyranvos, she had produced Tachypous (Middle Park Stakes) and Tromos (Dewhurst Stakes) and she went on to produce the Coronation Stakes winner Tolmi. He was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Blakeney the winner of the 1969 Epsom Derby, who stood as a breeding stallion at the National Stud. Cambanis named his colt after a town in Thessaly and sent him into training with Bruce Hobbs at the Palace House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 1979: two-year-old season Tyrnavos made his racecourse debut in the Ribero Stakes over six furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse in September. According to Timeform he appeared to have \\"little idea of what was required\\" but showed promise in finishing a close third behind Thousandfold and Dalsaan. Later in the month, the colt was moved up in distance for the Roverre Trophy Stakes over seven furlongs at Ascot. He won by a length from Eyelight but was not particularly impressive. In October, Tyrnavos was moved up in class to contest the Group One Dewhurst Stakes, the most important race for two-year-olds run in the United Kingdom, in which he faced a strong field including Monteverdi, Henbit, Romeo Romani (Norfolk Stakes), Marathon Gold (Lanson Champagne Stakes) and Final Straw (Champagne Stakes). He disputed the early lead with Henbit and after looking to be struggling three furlongs from the finish he stayed on strongly to take second place, two lengths behind Monteverdi. 1980: three- year-old season Tyrnavos began his second season in April at Newmarket where he contested the Craven Stakes, a trial race for the 2000 Guineas. Ridden by Eddie Hide, he started at odds of 5/1 and won by a neck from Star Way with World Leader in third place. In the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance on 3 May he raced prominently for most of the race but was unable to quicken in the last quarter mile and finished seventh, eight lengths behind the subsequently disqualified Nureyev. At York Racecourse later that month, Tyrnavos was moved up in distance to ten and a half furlongs for the Dante Stakes, a trial for The Derby. He finished strongly, but was beaten into fourth place behind Hello Gorgeous, Master Willie and Water Mill. On 4 June, Tyrnavos was one of twenty-four colts to contest the 201st running of the Derby over one and a half miles on firm ground at Epsom Downs Racecourse. He was well-fancied for the race despite some concerns that, as the son of a sprinter (Stilvi), he might struggle to stay the distance. The early stages were very rough and Tyrnavos was blocked and bumped several times before being forced to the wide outside on the final turn. He made little progress in the straight and eventually finished twelfth behind Henbit. On 28 June, Tyrnavos, racing on soft ground for the first time, started a 25/1 outsider for the Irish Derby at the Curragh. The field included Master Willie, Rankin, Pelerin and Garrido who had finished second, third, fourth and fifth in the Epsom Derby as well as Nikoli, the beaten favourite. Ridden by Tony Murray Tyrnavos took the lead shortly after the start and set a steady pace. Apparently relishing the ground conditions, he was never headed, staying on strongly in the straight to win by one and a half lengths from the Dick Hern-trained Prince Bee, with Ramian two and a half length away in third. His win gave Bruce Hobbs the first and only classic winner of his training career. The winning time was an unusually slow 2:43.8. The ground was firmer when Tyrnavos contested Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot a month later. Ridden by Hide he led until the approach to the final turn, when he was overtaken by Ela-Mana-Mou. He appeared to be still in contention for second place when he was bumped by More Light and dropped away quickly to finish eighth of the ten runners. Shortly after his run at Ascot, Tyrnavos was syndicated at ¬£20,000 a share, giving him a theoretical value of ¬£800,000. Assessment In 1979, Timeform gave Tyrnavos a rating of 124, five pounds below their top-rated juvenile Monteverdi. In the official International Classification he was again rated five pounds below Monteverdi, who shared top-rating with the French colt Dragon. In the following year he was rated 129, by Timeform, eight pounds below their best horse of the year Moorestyle. In the International Classification he was rated the tenth-best three-year-old colt in Europe. Stud record Tyrnavos was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Gazeley Stud in Newmarket and was later exported to Japan. The best of his offspring was Dihistan, who won the Hardwicke Stakes and the September Stakes in 1986. He died on 30 August 2003 in Japan. Pedigree *Tyrnavos was inbred 4 x 4 to Djebel, meaning that this stallion appear twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

This was to protect perishable items, with specific mention of live animals, from loss in the mails. It was considered a separate service from special delivery. The United States Post Office Department introduced this service in 1925, and provided a deep green 25¬¢ Special Handling postage stamp for it. As rates changed, three additional U. S. Special Handling stamps (10¬¢, 15¬¢ and 20¬¢) appeared 1928. Except for the given value, the basic colors and designs of all the Special Handling stamps were identical. The three latter denominations, as well as a second issue of the 25¬¢ stamp printed earlier in 1928, appear more yellow-green in tone than the original 1925 issue. In addition, various minor plate variations exist through the series, and the 1940 printings of the three lower values (the 25¬¢ stamp had been withdrawn late in 1928) are somewhat greener in appearance. However, catalogs normally list only the two 25¬¢ stamps as having noticeable color varieties. Stamps for Chicks...and Baby Alligators Finally, the three lower denominations were reissued in dry printings in 1955. This led to slight differences in the stamps' gum, paper and design sizes, and specialized catalogs may show them as sub-varieties. While the stamps were withdrawn in 1959, today (2015) the USPS provides this expedited delivery of packages by other means: through first class parcel service and priority mail. Special handling still exists, but is now more restrictively defined: it \\"provides preferential handling, but not preferential delivery, to the extent practicable in dispatch and transportation.\\" This service is primarily recommended for the delivery of live poultry, bees and similar cargo versus the delivery of non-living goods. Postal employees will take care to ensure that the special handling package is not crushed or handled roughly during delivery.

He was the lead singer on that band's 1966 Billboard hit, \\"Dirty Water\\", which includes the refrain \\"...Boston, you're my home\\". Early life Dodd was a native of Hermosa Beach, California, and joined the cast of The Mickey Mouse Club at the age of nine in 1955, its first season. (He was no relation to series star Jimmie Dodd.) He was a member of the cast for one of the three seasons, and during that time, paid Annette Funicello $20 for a snare drum, which the father of one of his co-stars (Cubby O'Brien) taught him to play. He was later a member of two surf rock bands, The Bel-Airs and Eddie & the Showmen, which he formed with Eddie Bertrand. He appeared as a dancer in the 1963 film musical Bye Bye Birdie, and had television guest roles in the 1960s. The Standells Dodd was a drummer and vocalist for the Standells starting in 1964. The group's biggest hit, \\"Dirty Water\\", recorded in 1965, became an anthem for sports fans in Boston with its refrain of \\"Boston, you're my home,\\" despite the group having no direct connection with the city. (The song was written by Ed Cobb, who was from New England and was working closely with the Standells in this time period). Dodd sang lead vocals on the recording; it was said of him: \\"When he opened his mouth, there was that voice: snotty and authoritative, an American Mick Jagger sort of voice....the sound that captures a particular era in '60s garage music.\\" Although the Standells were widely regarded as \\"one hit wonders\\", they had several lesser chart hits, and continued to record and tour. Dodd left the group in 1968. The Standells: biography by Richie Unterberger at Allmusic.com Later life Dodd continued to perform occasionally, including as Dick Dodd and the Dodd Squad, and the Dodd Squad and in some reunions of the Standells from the 1980s onwards, making his last performance with them in 2012. In 1968 he released a solo album titled The First Evolution of Dick Dodd.http://www.dickdodd.com/timeline.html He also sometimes worked in Buena Park as a limousine driver. Dodd became a fan of the Boston Red Sox later in life, and learned that the team played the song \\"Dirty Water\\" at Fenway Park after that. The song had been chosen as a theme song for the team in 1997. He performed the song with The Standells at the World Series in 2004, and at the team's home opener in 2005. In 2013 he announced that he was suffering from cancer, and died on November 29, 2013.

He was born at St Pancras, London. Educated at Sedbergh School, Watson later studied at the University of Oxford. Watson made his first-class debut in unusual circumstances during a match between Oxford University and a combined Minor counties team in 1939. Having bowled nine overs in Oxford University's first-innings, the Minor Counties Francis Wilkinson was injured and took no further part in the match. The spectating Watson was allowed by the agreement of Oxford University to take to the field for the Minor Counties as a substitute player. Batting in the Minor Counties first-innings, Watson scored 33 runs before he was dismissed by Michael Farebrother, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by the same bowler for 35 runs. Following this match he made a second first-class appearance, this time for Oxford University against Leicestershire. In a match which ended as a draw he was dismissed for 7 runs in the university's first- innings by Vic Jackson, while in their second-innings he remained unbeaten with 8 runs. Military career and death Watson served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, reaching the rank of sub-lieutenant by 1943. Serving as part of the Fleet Air Arm stationed at HMS Saker in the United States, Watson was undertaking a training flight on 3 October 1943 with a F4U Corsair when his plane was involved in a mid-air collision with fellow Fleet Air Arm pilot and fighter ace Alfred Jack Sewell close to the Maine town of New Gloucester, killing both pilots.

Over 1000 Class 40s were constructed by Electroputere (EP) under ASEA license in EPs Craiova Works from 1967 to 1991. Entering service in 1965, the Class 40 also operated on private railroads after the repeal of CFRs monopoly on rail transport. The vast majority of all the engines are still in service, as of 2020, having become an icon for the Romanian Railways. History CFR Class 41-0587-0 reversing in Gara de Nord, with the new livery Following the plans of Communist Party, the Romanian railway network was to reduce its operating steam engines to under 25% of the total number of engines. Since the start of dieselisation in Romania and the electrification of the first railway sector between Bucharest and Bra»ôov, communist ambitions were to improve local industrial capacities, remove dependency on outside sources and reduce conventional fuel consumption.Ceau»ôescu »ôi istoria locomotivelor realizate la \\"Electroputere\\" Since Romania did not develop an electrical locomotive to suit these ambitions, foreign partnerships were searched to design and home build a working horse for the Romanian Railways. Even if Romania has previously signed partnerships with Sulzer for the development of its diesel-electric locomotives, for the electric locomotive a partnership was signed with Sweden's Allm√§nna Svenska Elektriska (ASEA). Before signing the contract with ASEA, trials were made on the Predeal-Brasov mainline between 1963 and 1965. The locomotives used were: * 2 locomotives of SNCF class BB 12000, made by Alstom * a locomotive made by LEW Hennigsdorf, the predecessor of the DR Class E 251 * 2 locomotives made by ≈†koda Works Plzen, type 41E (this loco became the backbone of the Bulgarian Railways in 1963) * 2 locomotives made by ASEA type Rb (these would also go to Yugoslavia in 1967 to be the basis of JZ class 441) Builders CFR Class 45 =Allm√§nna Svenska Elektriska AB= 10 locomotives were made by ASEA after an agreement was reached in 1965. The locomotives were numbered from 060-EA-001 to 060-EA-009, and another unit, 060-EB-001 fitted with experimental electrical equipment (regenerative braking and thyristors) was delivered, though it was proven to be faulty and expensive to maintain and rarely used until 1991, when it was rebuilt into a regular 40 class unit. The 10 units were basically a SJ Rb but with heavy modifications (longer wheelbase, 6 axles), that were made until 1966. Out of all the 10 units that were delivered, only a few survive up to this day, 060-EA-001 being destroyed in an accident at Apa»õa in 1990, whilst a number of them have been renumbered/refurbished.Ceau»ôescu and Electroputere (in Romanian) At the time of their introduction, they were the second strongest class of electric locomotives in Europe, only being overtaken at this performance by the DB Class 103 in West Germany. Train Hungary Class 400 =Electroputere Craiova= All the engines that were built after 1966 were built by the Electroputere Craiova factory and have been identified by the EA designation. These are all 6 axle, 5100 kW engines, produced in a number of over 1000 units between 1967 and 1991. Electroputere (EP) manufactured both the mechanics and electronics of the engines, after mechanics for the engines stopped to be manufactured in Re»ôi»õa, EP took care of the entire manufacturing for these engines and had a yearly output of 150 engines per year. The differences between EA class and EA1 class (classes 40 respectively 41 under the new classification) is that class EA is designed for regular passenger trains and freight trains, being limited to 120 km/h whilst the class EA1 is designed for higher speed fast trains with a maximum speed of 160 km/h. The only Class 42 ever built at Gara de Nord. It holds the speed record in Romania (227 km/h in 1997, on Flore»ôti Prahova - Buda line). Until soon it was capable of speeds up to 200 km/H, but because one of the bearings is worn out, it can only achieve speeds of ~160 km/h In 1974, 060-EA1-122 (later 41-0122-6) was built using experimental 200 km/h axles and gear ratios and used as a test locomotive under the classification of EA2 (thus becoming 060-EA2-122, nicknamed \\"The General\\" due to this high ranking status). After the experiments proved successful, the axles and gear ratios were transferred to 060-EA2-302 (later 42-0302-2, now 420 302 under the UIC classification) in 1977 and 122 was soon converted into an EA1 machine using 160 km/h axles and gear ratios. 302 soon became the new \\"general\\", breaking the speed records for Romanian Railways twice, once in 1997 during testing of the Eurofima-based passenger cars on the Flore»ôti Prahova-Buda stretch of the Ploie»ôti-Bra»ôov mainline, and the second time in 2007 on the FƒÉurei ring during testing for Astra Arad passenger cars. In recent years it has been neglected and due to this, one of the bearings is damaged, resulting into the limitation of the speed to 160 km/h. The design proved to be very successful, and after an agreement in 1970, Yugoslav Railways decided to buy a number of locomotives that became the J≈Ω Series 461 from Electroputere, after CFR also agreed to buy Rade Koncar made locomotives. They were first delivered between 1971 and 1973, and they became so successful, that J≈Ω brought a second batch between 1978 and 1980. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, they were passed onto ≈ΩS, ≈ΩCG and M≈Ω. A number have been modernised, having been turned into 461.2 series (Serbia) and 462 series (North Macedonia). Further exports were achieved in 1986 and 1987 when the Bulgarian State Railways brought another number of units, that were also modernized, becoming the 46.2 series (the original series number being 40). Modernization of these locomotives is done by Rade Konƒçar Zagreb, REMARUL 16 Februarie Cluj and RELOC Craiova. Modernisations for the Romanian Railways' locomotives have been done by different companies, and the first of such concepts appeared in the late 1990s when Siemens (along with a few subcontractors) modernised a few units to CFR Class 45. The modernisations were a success and the locomotives were hailed as \\"Romania's first modern electric locomotives\\", produced between 1998 and 2002. Production was stopped though, and only a small number were made, all locomotives numbers beginning with 3xx. They were later rebuilt by Softronic Craiova, and up to this date only 1 unrefurbished locomotive (45-0318-1) runs in regular service, seen mostly on Bucharest-Constan»õa mainline. Starting with 2006 and 2007, a number of locomotives were rebuilt by Softronic and PROMAT as CFR Class 47, being a more successful modernisation. Refurbishments are done by SCRL Bra»ôov, RELOC, INDA and Softronic Craiova, REMAR Pa»ôcani and Cluj and PROMAT. From 2020 onwards, RELOC Craiova will begin to modernize more members of the classes, after SOFTRONIC quit modernizing locomotives into Class 47s in 2016. Aside from the exported models to ≈ΩS and BD≈Ω, these locomotives operate in Hungary and Slovakia. A number of examples are operated by Magyar Mag√°nvas√∫t Zrt., Train Hungary, Prv√° Slovensk√° ≈æelezniƒçn√°, Foxrail and Floyd Zrt., and are used in regular service in those countries. In 1998, OSE (Greek Railways) hired locomotive 060-EA-056 (manufactured 1968) to operate during the opening of the first electrified Greek railway line from Thessaloniki to Idomeni/Gevgelija, and was temporarily used until it was returned to CFR. Technical details The locomotive is known for its simplicity in operating - in the cab, original versions have a dashboard with a panel for gauges and switches, a throttle/dynamic brake wheel and brake levers, alongside with a knob for the horn, which has low/high and soft/hard tones and Hasler Bern speedometers (mostly replaced by Softronic IVMS speedometers). Subsequently upgraded versions changed that, with the ICOL cabs featuring a throttle/dynamic brake lever, the dashboard is higher and features an on-board computer, and 2 buttons that remove the horn's ability to use the soft/hard tonnes. Certain modernizations (such as by PROMAT but in lower numbers) maintain the \\"wheel\\" but have a renovated dashboard, somewhat similar to the CFR Class 46. Inside the machines' hall, electric current enters into the oil-cooled transformer, where it is converted from 25 kV AC to 1.5 kV, passing through silicon diode rectifiers where it is converted into DC current for the ASEA LJE 108 traction motors. There are also 3 ventilation groups that activate after 5 seconds each; the locomotive can start without the ventilators turned on, but only for shunting. Not using the ventilation on higher traction currents will lead to damage to the traction motors. The traction motors weigh 3,7 tonnes, and with all of them running properly, produce up to 5400kW of hourly power, and 5100kW continuous power. Electric current is obtained with the help of 2 pantographs and the main switch, type IAC-25. Early models until the mid-1970s had ASEA LLXJN 135 (with one skid plate for 120 km/h of maximum speed and with two skid plates for 160 km/h of maximum speed), but beginning with 1975, locomotives began to be delivered with Faiveley EP1 pantographs, which became a standard factory option from the late 1970s onwards. From the 1990s onwards, Faiveley EP2 and EP3 pantographs became more common, while certain modernized examples (and for a brief period of time in the late 1990s for EA2 302) use Schunk WBLs, with some examples using Stemmann Technik DSA150s and Schunk WBL-Z (single arm) pantographs. EA1 292 was fitted with experimental Faiveley AX pantographs (typically fitted on SNCF Astride locomotives) between 1997 and 1998, in order to test them for the upcoming Class 45 modernization program. The throttle and dynamic brake controller operates in a similar way to the BR Class 86 tap charger mechanism, with 40 throttle steps (including the 3 initial shunting positions), plus 3 weakfield positions, all displayed on a gauge. Dynamic braking is controlled in the same way as the throttle is, being activated by moving the wheel rightwards (as opposed to leftwards for throttle), with a limit of ~960A for its operation. All locomotives are fitted with standard dynamic braking, but between 1966 and 1991, one unit was fitted experimentally with regenerative braking, however it was very ineconomical to operate, not to mention dangerous for the locomotive and the catenary. The unit, EB 001, was rebuilt and renumbered into EA 931. The air brakes fitted on these locomotives are Knorr KD2 (train) and Oerlikon FD1 (locomotive). For Yugoslavia, the train brake was also manufactured by Oerlikon, not to mention the fact that the cab is placed on the left instead of the right side, as at the time the Yugoslavian Railways ordered its electric locomotives with the driving position on the right. Notable units During the 1980s and 1990s, multiple locomotives became easily recognizeable due to their liveries, which was in part, due to the drivers of these locomotives customizing them within the cab and outside. As such, it was common to see locomotives using window curtains, tricolor-painted stripes and various shades of the colors used by CFR at the time. Eventually this \\"tradition\\" died out when multiple locomotives were refurbished or scrapped, but some train drivers continued it in the 2000s and 2010s, including on modernized Class 47s. Certain locomotives also gained various nicknames, instead of a common nickname for the whole class. *EA 079 was made by Electroputere in 1979, and in the late 1990s it was refurbished by the same company in order to operate at 15 kV AC, for German railway operator Karsdorfer Eisenbahngesellschaft (this same operator purchased second-hand locomotives from Romania and the former East Germany). With its bankruptcy, it was stored for years in Germany, until ABB refurbished the locomotive in the mid 2010s in Sweden, looking for potential customers. It eventually entered ownership of VTR(Vest Trans Rail) after a year, being converted back to 25 kV AC operation. *EA1 122 was made by Electroputere in 1974, and painted in a livery that featured a orange stripe instead of the standard red/blue stripe, and it also featured tricolor curtains in the cab. After modernization, the dashboard paneling was painted green, but the locomotive's livery became the standard white with red front ends. *EA 127 was made by Electroputere in 1976, and in the 1990s it was painted in a blue and grey livery, similar to the ones fitted on DA diesel locomotives when they arrived from Switzerland in 1959. It was scrapped in 2002 at Ciceu. *EA 236 was made by Electroputere in 1975, and is one of the few locomotives to still retain its original livery and pantographs, having been refurbished in April 2018 by SCRL Bra»ôov to its almost/original condition. *EA1 242 was operated by the Bra»ôov train depot, and in the 2000s and early 2010s it was well taken care of by its driver. *EA 247 was one of the last \\"classical\\" locomotives with a tricolor stripe and original Hasler speedometer, in 2013 it was modernized into a Class 47. *EA 721 was made by Electroputere in 1984, and is one of the only 3 locomotives that was built with corrugated side walls (somewhat resembling the DR Class 243), and the only one still operating as of today. *EA 801 was nicknamed \\"Dolly\\" by the drivers where it was stabled at, and in 1996 it spotted a livery similar to the DA diesels that operated at the time, but with a \\"reversed\\" stripe (painted in white) and had a white dashboard as well.

It celebrated its 1,000th anniversary in 2003. History The convent was founded between 1002 and 1008 by the Countess Wichburg, the wife of Count Ottwin von Sonnenburg of Pustertal. Wichbirg was the sister of the Archbishop Hartwig. The founder's daughter Hildpurg, a nun in the Nonnberg Benedictine abbey in Salzburg, was ordained as the first abbess, and brought the first nuns with her. Count Ottwin and Countess Wichburg were entombed in the crypt of the convent. In the 12th century the convent was reformed. It was placed under the direction of the abbot Wolford of Admont Abbey in 1122. From the 1170s the convent returned to the suzerainty of Salzburg. There is a record of Ulrich II, Duke of Carinthia making a donation to the monastery on 31 March 1199. The convent suffered economic difficulties, and had difficulty paying taxes to support the Turkish wars. At one point during the Protestant Reformation the community was reduced to the abbess Dorothea Rumpf and two other nuns. They later received support from the G√∂ss Abbey, including the Abbess Afra von Staudach (1562), which helped renew the community. By 1683 the convent had 31 nuns and 16 lay sisters. It had an apothecary, and cared for as many as 500 invalids each year. The convent also ran a school. 1783 the monastery was dissolved by Emperor Joseph II. In 1788 it was put up for auction. Maximilian Thadd√§us von Egger bought it for 163,100 gulden and made the monastery complex the new seat of the Count of Egger. The castle was opened to tourists around the end of the 18th century. In 1934 it was sold to the Missionary Order of Mariannhill. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) it served for a while as the seminary of Gurk, then was converted into a military hospital in 1943. The Marianhiller's took the building back in 1948. In 1959 it was purchased by the Diocese of Gurk for use as an Episcopal educational establishment. Today the former Benedictine convent includes a church where services are still held, an educational establishment run by the diocese, a hotel and seminar facilities. Building The convent and the church, with its crypt, are built on stone foundations that date back to Roman times. The north-west wing of the present complex was built in 1546 In the years 1654 to 1658 the monastery was remodeled in the baroque style by the architect Pietro Francesco Carlone. The impressive high altar was probably built in the late 17th century. Parts of the original buildings and the Renaissance arcades in the northern courtyard have been preserved.

Swartwout served as a Brigadier General in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War under General George Washington. He was a close ally of many key Founding Fathers of the United States, and a delegate to New York State's convention for ratification of the US Constitution. Family and early life General Swartwout homestead near Fishkill Jacobus Swartwout was born in Wiccopee, New York on November 5, 1734, the son of Captain Jacobus Swartwout (1692‚Äì1749) and Gieletjen Nieuwkerk (1691‚Äì1749). He was baptized at the Fishkill Dutch Reformed Church. He was the grandson of Thomas Samuel Swartwout, the great grandson of Roeloff Swartwout and the great great grandson of Tomys Swartwout. His father married Gieletjen \\"Jannetie\\" Nieuwkerk of Kingston, Ulster County, New York on October 5, 1714 in Old Dutch Church in Kingston. In 1721, his father purchased 306 acres of land from Catheryna Brett. The farm was situated south of the Fishkill Creek, about nine miles from the Hudson River, in an area known as Wiccopee. Major Swartwout homestead near Port Jervis His father's cousin, Major Jacobus Swartwout (1696‚Äì1756), was the son of Antoni Swartwout (1664‚Äì1700) and the grandson of Roeloff Swartwout. He owned land at Maghaghkemeck (now Port Jervis, Orange County), and was a Major in the light foot militia of Orange County under Col. Vincent Matthews from the 1730s to 1760. Military career General George Washington to Colonel Swartwout from West Point, October 1779 French and Indian War Swartwout continued the tradition of family military service when, 21 days after his wedding to Aeltje in 1759, he was appointed captain of a company of Dutchess County volunteers. He began his military training under Lord Jeffrey Amherst at Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point. First American Intelligence Service The first organization under the Articles of Confederation created for counterintelligence purposes was the Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies, later the Commission. It was made up of a board established in New York between June 1776 and January 1778 to collect intelligence, apprehend British spies and couriers, and examine suspected British sympathizers. In effect, it was created as \\"secret service\\" which had the power to arrest, to convict, to grant bail or parole, and to imprison or to deport. A company of militia was placed under its command, of which Jacobous Swartwout was in command. The Committee heard over 500 cases involving disloyalty and subversion. The Committee changed to a Commission by Continental Congress in February 1777 and moved to Kingston, The Board consisted of Egbert Benson, Melancton Smith and Jacobus Swartwout with John Jay remaining as Chairman. American Revolution In September 1774, colonial representatives in Philadelphia called for the establishment of a Committee of Observation in each county. Swartwout was named the Deputy Chairman of the Fishkill local Committee. On July 8, 1775 Captain Swartwout was appointed Muster-master of four companies to be raised. Twenty-nine members of the Swartwout family served in the war of American independence, two having the rank of brigadier-general, three that of captain, three of lieutenant, and four of ensign. He was made Colonel 1st Regiment Dutchess County New York Militia 1776 as well as Colonel of Charlotte County New York Militia June 25, 1778, as part of Governor George Clinton's Brigade. He was later promoted to Brigadier-General Dutchess County New York Militia, March 3, 1780. The Dutchess County militia or \\"Swartwout Regiment\\" was part of Governor Clinton's Brigade and William Heath's Division during the Battle of Long Island. In the writings of General George Washington's manuscripts, Swartwout's regiment left Kings Bridge 18 October 1776, to fight in the Battle of White Plains. The regiment was about 364 men strong and were in service at Fort Washington, Fort Independence, the Battle of Long Island, Kings Bridge, the Battle of White Plains, the defense of New York levies as well as other engagements through the end of the war on the Northern front. Swartwout resigned on Oct 3, 1794 and promoted Abraham Brinkerhoff to the post for Dutchess County.Lesser,C.H., The Sinews of Independence, Monthly Strength Reports of the Continental Army, Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press, 1976 Swartwoutville, and the American Revolution General George Washington to Colonel Swartwout, Library of Congress In 1760, Swartwout purchased 3,000 acres of land from Madam Brett and built his first home after his wedding to Aaltje Brinkerhoff, of Brinkerhoff, New York. The Swartwoutville Hamlet is located in the south east corner of the town of Wappinger, New York. General George Washington was staying in Fishkill in October 1778. The headquarters of the commander-in-chief was then in the home of Captain John Brinkerhoff father-in-law to Jacobus Swartwout, in a low stone home about midway on the highway between the settlement of Brinkerhoff and Swartwoutville. During this period Prussian-American General, Baron Frederick William Augustus de Steuben, had his headquarters at the neighboring homestead of Colonel Jacobus Swartwout, standing immediately south of his later residence at Swartwoutville. Others who visited and quartered at Jacobus Swartwout's homestead along with General Washington and Baron Von Stueben were, Marquis de Lafayette and, Israel Putnam. Political career Swartwout was one of the original New York state legislators, elected in 1777 to the 1st New York state legislature. He served for eighteen years, six as a New York State Assemblyman and eleven years as a New York State Senator from 1784-1795. He also served on the Council of Appointment from 1784.7th New York State Legislature#Members1st New York State Legislature#Assemblymen Ratification of the US Constitution and support for the Bill of Rights 159x159px Swartwout was a delegate to the US Constitutional Convention on June 17, 1788, to decide whether New York State would approve the new Federal US Constitution. On the first vote for ratification, Swartwout voted in favor of ratification, with the Federalists, including Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and Robert R. Livingston. He later changed his vote on the last round to support the amendment of the Bill of Rights to the Constitution prior to ratification. Eventually, the Convention also recommended amendments to the Constitution, and it unanimously approved a \\"Circular Letter\\" to the states urging the call of a second general convention to consider these amendments and those proposed by other states.Mr. Duane's motion that the Convention be opened every day by Prayer, Convention of the State of New York on the adoption of the Federal Constitution, Minutes - Image Gallery ...

Built in 1938, it anticipated the post-war, two seat Dittmar Condor IV and held the Italian national distance record for many years. Design and development Construzioni Aeronautiche Taliedo (CAT) built two German glider designs under licence, the second of them the single seat Dittmar Condor II. This was designated CAT 28 and flew in 1936. At Adriano Mantelli's suggestion, Etteore Cattaneo designed a two-seat version, the CAT 28BP, with a second seat in tandem under the wing and an increase in span and wing area to cope with the greater weight. It was intended for record breaking, aerobatics and as a training aircraft. At the time there was no German two seat Condor, though the Condor IV was produced post-war. Though greater in span, the two seater's wing was very similar to that of the CAT 28. It was built around a single spar; plywood covering ahead of the spar around the leading edge formed a torsion resisting D-box, with fabric covering behind the spar. It had a rectangular plan inner section with dihedral and tapered outer panels without dihedral, producing a gull wing ending in elliptical tips. The taper on the trailing edge began at greater span than the change of dihedral but the ailerons filling it were hinged parallel to the tapered region. Spoilers just aft of the spar and beyond the inner section of the wing extended above and below it. The fuselage was also a ply skinned, wooden structure which supported the wing centrally on what was, on the CAT 28, a pedestal, developed into a second, rear cockpit with side windows and accessed from above via a forward hinged trap door in the wing. Single faired lift struts on each side from the lower fuselage braced the wing at the edge of the inner gull section. The insertion of the second seat left the overall length and the fuselage otherwise unchanged; the front cockpit was ahead of the wing leading edge with a rear hinged canopy that could be opened in flight for pilots who preferred open cockpits. Dual control was fitted. Aft of the trailing edge the fuselage became slender. The CAT 28BP had a high aspect ratio, strongly tapered all moving tailplane with a small cut-out for rudder movement. Its fin was short and small but mounted a large, curved and rounded balanced rudder which extended down to the keel, protected by a small tail bumper. The main undercarriage was a skid running aft from the nose to behind the rear cockpit. The CAT 28BP first flew in 1938, piloted by Mantelli, and performed well in testing. For many years it held the Italian national distance record. It also competed with success in national competitions.

An ·ªçp·ªçÃÅn If√° is a divination tray used in traditional African and Afro-American religions, notably in the system known as If√° and in Yoruba tradition more broadly. The etymology of opon, literally meaning \\"to flatter\\", explains the artistic and embellished nature of the trays, as they are meant to praise and acknowledge the noble work of the babalowo (diviners). The etymology of the term If√°, however, has been a subject of debate. If√° may be considered an orisha, or a Yoruba god -- specifically, the god of divination. Conversely, some scholars have referred to If√° merely as the \\"great consulting oracle\\" as opposed to a god or a deity, without any divine connotations. Opon If√° are typically made by wood carvers who specialize in the trays, and are made with designs per request of the patron babalowo or by the carver's own accord. The emphasis on the tray's design is not only due to their \\"flattering\\" nature, but also because of their functionality during consultation. Different carvers employ various aesthetic styles within West Africa and in the African diaspora, but most carvers are able to trace their influence back to Oyo, in present-day Nigeria. During divination consultations, the opon If√° is used by a babalowo to communicate with If√°, who is able to identify the causes and solutions to personal and collective problems, and to restore harmony with the spirits. An intermediary orisha, Esu, serves as the messenger between the babalowo and If√°, as the two spirits are close companions to each other. In conjunction with other divine instruments such as an iroke If√° (diviner's tapper), ikin If√° (sacred palm or kola nuts) or opele If√° (divination chain), and iyerosun (divining powder), the opon If√° is used to determine the odu, or verses, associated with a patron's particular predicament. Once an odu is revealed by If√°, the babalowo then elucidates a solution that is embedded in the archetypal story described in the specific odu.  Structure  Opon If√° are wooden, generally between 15 and 46 centimeters (6 and 18 inches) in diameter, and are flat and usually circular; however, rectangular, semi-circular, and approximately square specimens have also been observed. The trays exhibit a raised outer perimeter - often embellished with carved figures, objects, and abstract geometric designs. The artistic intricacy of the peripheral carvings are a status marker among babalowos, and suggest their importance to clients. The top of the tray is called the \\"head\\" or the oju opon, and the bottom is conversely called the \\"feet\\" or the ese opon. Typically, the head is adorned with a carved depiction of Esu, the messenger of If√°. Certain trays may have additional representations of Esu, and trays with two, four, eight, and even sixteen faces have been studied. In such cases, the \\"head\\" of the tray may be designated by cowries. The cowries are also used to spread the sacred divining powder, iyerosun. The peripheral markings of the opon If√° are functional as well as ornamental. They serve to divide the perimeter into nine different sections that contribute symbolic significance during consultations. Each section is named after one of nine ancient and influential diviners. In a divination reading, the babalowo sits facing east with the opon If√° in front of them, such that the \\"feet\\" of the tray is closest to them. In this orientation, the oju opon (\\"face of the tray\\"), ese opon (\\"feet of the tray\\"), ona kanran (\\"straight path\\"), and the ona murun (\\"direct path\\") are respectively situated on the east, west, south and north sides of the tray's perimeter. On the diagonals from these cardinal directions are four additional sections or diviners: alaselosi (\\"the one who implements with the left\\") to the northeast, alabolotun (\\"the one who proposes with the right\\") to the southeast, afurukeresayo (\\"the one who has a diviner's fly-whisk and is happy\\") to the northwest, and ajiletepowo (\\"an early riser who sits down and prospers\\") to the southwest. The final section is the space in the center of the tray, the erilade opon (\\"the meeting place that crowns all\\"), for a total of nine sections. These sections come into play during consultations when the babalowo individually evokes the presence of If√° and the nine ancient diviners before beginning the reading of the tray. The circumference of opon If√° may also be carved with animals that are significant in Yoruba mythology. Such markings are believed by practitioners to allow the babalowo to harness the powers of the depicted animal, enhancing the general efficacy of the tray, or heightening the effectiveness of certain odu. The abilities of the animals can sometimes be inferred by examining their roles in any of the 256 archetypal stories associated with the odu. For instance, Opon If√° may display carvings of bush rats, or okete, which in Yoruba mythology can take on human form to conduct nighttime mischief. Birds are also depicted, which symbolize witchcraft. Finally, according to diviners from Oyo, Nigeria, snakes may symbolize the efficacy of If√° divination as a whole, as it is believed that snakes obtained their venomous capacity from If√° ‚Äì as outlined in the odu okaran asa. Furthermore, snakes may symbolize If√° himself, perhaps responsible for their prevalence in opon If√° and in other Yoruba art. When abstract or crisscross markings are incorporated with zoomorphic imagery, they may offer a kinetic and sentient quality to the depicted animals, further enhancing the tray's divine potency.  Yoruba carvers  Historically, Yoruba carvers played an important role in their communities ‚Äì many were specialists, creating an array of objects from the banal (e.g. stools, walking sticks, etc.) to the divine (e.g. shrine sculptures, headdresses, etc.). Most of the carvers specialized in opon If√° traced their roots to Are Lagbayi, a master palace wood carver of old Oyo, in present-day Nigeria. His legacy is continued by the opon If√° carvers who are frequented by babalowo, and create trays with designs of their own discretion or by request of their patron diviners. Some sources of aesthetic inspiration are the fables of storied diviners, the spirits and archetypal everyday experiences described by the odu, and instruments used during If√° consultations ‚Äì such as the iroke If√°.  Variations  alt=A tray with elaborately carved borders, placing a circle within a rectangle. There are variations in the structure of opon If√°, particularly in regard to the number and location of depicted Esu faces and the geometric shape of the board. Even within a town there will be different forms of the tray. For example, one tray may depict Esu with his chin protruding into the center of the tray (the erilade opon), while another depicts two Esu faces on opposite sides of the tray. Although the If√° system of divination finds its roots among the Yoruba, its practise has spread amongst the African diaspora and is known by different names, with subtle to profound alterations. Beyond the foundational features of the opon If√° outlined above, the functional nature of the structural enhancements cannot be generalized and are typically left to the artist's discretion. A particularly notable specimen is one from the 17th century Kingdom of Dahomey, in present- day Benin, which was used for F√° divination. This board displays a standard circular opon If√° in the center of the tray, but is encompassed by a larger, rectangular tray. In Cuban Santer√≠a, heavily influenced by If√°, opon If√° may also be employed; this will often display a broad color gamut, and may lack a depiction of Esu.  Yoruba beliefs  The face of Esu, the intermediary orisha between If√° and the babalawo, is generally carved into the opon If√°'s perimeter to acknowledge his critical role during divine consultations and to allow the babalowo to directly confront him. The relationship between the two deities is outlined in the Yoruba canon - specifically from among the 256 odu, or verses, that the babalawo interprets from the opon If√° - and provides an account for how Esu came to occupy his role. The following is an account of the myth by an If√° chief from Oyo, Nigeria: If√° and Esu are two of the four- hundred orisha sent to Earth by Olodumare, the supreme being in Yoruba religion. Each of the four-hundred divinities has unique supernatural abilities; If√° knows the predestined fate of all human beings, and Esu is the keeper of the ase (divine power or authority). Esu, confident in his status as the wisest among all of Olodumare's spirits, administered a test to 398 of the other deities, all of whom failed. Only then did Esu test If√°. Esu requested that If√° supervise his monkey for one week while he undertook a journey. If√° agreed, but first he asked Esu to tie the monkey to the tree in front of his house. After Esu had embarked on his journey, If√° consulted an oracle to see what Esu's intentions were for his journey. The oracle prescribed to If√° a sacrificial offering of bananas that must be performed deep in a thick forest. If√° obliged and performed the sacrifice, only to find Esu's monkey missing once he returned to the tree in front of his home. Esu, having suddenly decided to not pursue his trip, returned to If√°'s home to see that If√° had broken his commitment. Grief-stricken, Esu began to weep. He informed If√° that if he did not find the monkey within the seven days that it takes for his tears to fall to the ground, If√° would be cursed without peace for the rest of his life. Seeking a solution, If√° once again consulted the oracle, who told him to return to the exact spot in the forest where the sacrifice of bananas had been performed. There, he would find the monkey. If√° accepted the oracle's guidance and found Esu's monkey in the forest. Having returned the monkey to Esu before his tears hit the earth, If√° completed the test and sealed his partnership with Esu. To express his gratitude, Esu swore to be a companion and accomplice to If√° in all his endeavors. Thus, Esu acts as the mouthpiece through which If√° imparts his clairvoyant knowledge.  In divination consultations  alt= During a divination session, the babalawo first properly orients the tray with the \\"feet\\" of the opon If√° facing towards him. He sits facing east, the direction from which If√° is thought to have come from the spiritual plane, and allows light to illuminate the tray, being careful to prevent shadows from landing on the wood. Once properly oriented, an iroke If√°, or a diviner's tapper, is used by the babalowo to evoke the presence of If√° via the rhythmic drumming of the tapper on the surface of the opon If√°. The nine diviners symbolically depicted in the tray's perimeter are also summoned. Then, sixteen palm or kola nuts, the ikin If√°, are thrown onto the opon If√°'s wooden surface and the babalowo proceeds to interpret which of the 256 possible sets of odu (verses) are displayed by the nuts. An odu is essentially a word or sign of eight marks that is drawn in the iyerosun powder scattered over the tray. Each of the signs have corresponding verses which must be chanted and chosen according to the client's particular situation. Each of the odu is constructed by individually determining each \\"letter\\" of the odu in a step-wise manner, starting from the bottom-right division of the border, then the bottom-left. Working up from bottom to top, this process is repeated six more times until the complete odu is constructed and written on the board. If sacred palm nuts are used, sixteen nuts are held in one hand by the babalawo. With the other hand, he snatches as many as he can out of his palm. If there is one remaining, he draws two vertical lines into the iyerosun powder on the board. If there are two nuts remaining, he draws only one line. The process continues until two figures of four segments each are formed. Another way to use the opon If√° incorporates a divination chain known as opele If√°, reserving the palm or kola nuts for more serious questions. The opele consists of a chain of eight half-kola nuts strung together, each associated with one of the eight letters of an odu and a site along the tray's border. After evoking the spirits with the iroke If√°, the babalowo then throws the opele; each of the eight half-nuts will land concave up or concave down, heads or tails. A single line represents \\"heads\\" while two vertical lines symbolize \\"tails\\" ‚Äì this process is recorded in the iyerosun powder, as it is done with the palm nuts. Thus, this binary system of one and two vertical lines gives rise to 256 different odu, each associated with a spirit and certain archetypal situation. Some odu are affirmative, and others are negative. Furthermore, the odu determines what offerings the babalowo prescribes to the client in order for them to achieve their desired ends.

Their disappearance was widely reported by the national news media. On November 7, 2014, police announced they had arrested Charles \\"Chase\\" Merritt, Joseph McStay's business partner, and intended to charge him with the murders. The trial began on January 7, 2019, in San Bernardino. On June 10, 2019, a jury found Merritt guilty of murdering the McStay family. He was sentenced to death on January 21, 2020.  Background  In 2010, Joseph McStay (age 40) and his wife Summer (age 43) lived in Fallbrook, California, with their sons Gianni (age 4) and Joseph Jr. (age 3). Joseph owned and operated Earth Inspired Products, a company that built decorative fountains, and Summer was a licensed real estate agent. Summer was born Virginia Lisa Aranda, and had also been known as Summer Martelli.  Disappearance  On February 4, 2010, at 7:47 pm, a neighbor's surveillance system captured the bottom eighteen inches of a vehicle, thought at the time to be the McStay family's 1996 Isuzu Trooper. In the surveillance recording, the vehicle's occupants could not be seen. At 8:28 pm, a call was placed from Joseph's cell phone to his business associate, Charles \\"Chase\\" Merritt, which went to voicemail. Merritt later told police that he ignored the voicemail because he was watching a movie. Joseph's cellphone pinged a tower in Fallbrook. Over the next several days, relatives of the McStays unsuccessfully tried to contact the family. On February 13, Joseph's brother Michael traveled to the McStay residence and, upon finding an open window in back, climbed in and gained entry to the home. Michael did not find any of the family at home, and their two dogs were in the backyard. On February 15, Michael phoned the San Diego County Sheriff's Department (SDSD) and reported that his brother and his family was missing. Officers arrived at the home and requested a search warrant, executed on February 19, 2010. Although a search of the house found no evidence of struggle or foul play, there were indications of a hasty departure: a carton of eggs had been left on the counter and two child-size bowls of popcorn sat on a sofa. During their investigation, the police learned that around 11:00 pm on February 8, the family's Trooper had been towed from a strip mall parking lot in San Ysidro, San Diego, near the Mexican border. It was believed to have been parked there between 5:30 and 7:00 that evening. The car's location from February 4 to February 8 remains unknown.  Discovery of remains  On November 11, 2013, a motorcyclist found four sets of human remains buried in two shallow graves in the desert near Victorville, California. Patrick McStay, Joseph's father, was informed of the discovery and phoned missing person advocate Jerrie Dean to tell her what he knew. Dean stated in her blog she had just finished producing a radio show for San Diego station KNSJ when she received the call, and that she asked whether she could tell her followers what he had told her. Two days later, two sets of remains were officially identified as those of Joseph and Summer McStay. The deaths were ruled a homicide and San Bernardino County authorities said they believed the family died of blunt force trauma inside their home, but declined to discuss specifics of the deaths or a motive. Reaction and investigation The circumstances surrounding the family's disappearance and the lack of clues about their whereabouts triggered speculation by amateur sleuths. Radio host Rick Baker published a book, No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family. Baker began following the case in 2013 after interviewing Michael McStay on his program. He conducted dozens of interviews on the case (traveling to Mexico, Belize, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic), followed leads, and reported sightings of the family. In the book, he speculated that Summer might have committed the murders. When the bodies were found, he offered a refund to those who purchased his book before November 2013. After their disappearance it was speculated that the McStays left voluntarily, since investigators found searches on the family's computers for, \\"What documents do children need for traveling to Mexico?\\" and Spanish language lessons. Because their car was found so close to the Mexican border, police reviewed surveillance footage of the pedestrian gate into Mexico. Video recorded the evening of February 8, released on March 5, showed a family of four resembling the McStays crossing the border. On February 19, California police notified Interpol to be on the lookout for the family. In April 2013, the San Diego Sheriff's Department announced that they believed that the McStays traveled to Mexico voluntarily. Unconfirmed sightings of the family were reported in Mexico and elsewhere, perpetuating hopes that they were safe and had left voluntarily. Relatives of the McStays doubted that they would travel to Mexico, saying that Joseph and Summer avoided the country because of the safety threat posed by recent drug wars. Other critics of the theory noted that the McStays had more than $100,000 in bank accounts, with no withdrawal of funds in preparation for a trip, and their accounts were untouched after their disappearance. Summer's sister stated that her passport was expired. Although it is possible for a U.S. citizen to enter Mexico without a passport, one is required to reenter the United States. Investigators and the public also focused on Merritt, who was the last known person to have had contact with Joseph, and the first to notice his disappearance. According to state records, Merritt had felony convictions for burglary and receiving stolen property. His most recent felony conviction, in 2001, was for the theft of $32,000 worth of welding and drilling equipment from San Gabriel Valley Ornamental Iron Works in Monrovia, California. An acquaintance of Merritt's told a San Diego reporter, \\"I think police should look at him and anyone associated with him.\\" In 2013, Merritt acknowledged he had spent more than an hour with Joseph the day the McStay family went missing. Merritt, who reportedly was the last person Joseph called from his cell phone, also said that he had passed a polygraph test and did not know anything that could help solve the mystery of the family's disappearance. When asked if he thought Merritt was a suspect, Joseph's father Patrick said, \\"I have to have faith in Chase because I have to have faith in my son. I believe that [Joseph] trusted Chase and believed in Chase. Do I think Chase is involved? I don't think so, and I truly hope not.\\" In January 2014, Merritt said that he might write a book about the family, alleging that Summer had anger issues and that Joseph had been ill for some time with a mysterious ailment. Joseph's family confirmed that he had an unexplained illness and that Summer was possessive of her husband, but they called Merritt's suggestion that she was responsible for his illness unfounded. Patrick said, \\"I truly believe she loved my son.\\"  Arrest and trial On November 5, 2014, detectives from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department arrested Merritt in connection with the deaths of the McStay family after discovering that his DNA had been recovered from their car. His arrest was announced on November 7, 2014. Merritt was charged with four counts of murder, and the district attorney sought the death penalty. In July 2015, Merritt's defense attorney filed a request to have the case dismissed because of the wording used by the prosecution when the charges were filed. According to arrest warrant affidavits filed in the case, autopsies concluded that all four victims had been beaten to death with a blunt object, and investigators believed the murder weapon was a 3-pound sledgehammer which was found in the grave containing the remains of Summer and her son. Investigators testified they believed the victims were tortured before they were killed. Prosecutors allege that Merritt had a gambling problem, and killed the McStay family for financial gain. They said that he wrote checks totaling more than $21,000 on Joseph's business account in the days after the family was killed, and then went on a gambling spree at nearby casinos, where he lost thousands of dollars. Merritt's trial was delayed as he had repeatedly fired his attorneys or attempted to represent himself. , he had gone through five attorneys. In January 2018, a trial-setting conference was scheduled for February 23. Merritt's attorney filed a motion in San Bernardino Superior Court on April 7, 2018, arguing that Joseph's business and accounting records were hearsay evidence and therefore inadmissible. On May 4, the case was scheduled to go to trial in July 2018. The trial finally began on January 7, 2019, in a San Bernardino court, with both sides making opening statements. On June 10, 2019, a San Bernardino County jury found Merritt guilty of murdering the McStay family.Charles Merritt Found Guilty Of Slaying McStay Family CBS Los Angeles, June 10, 2019 On June 24, the jury recommended that Merritt be sentenced to death. The court upheld the jury's recommendation, and Merritt was sentenced to death on January 21, 2020.

William Gwavas, 19th-century portrait Life The eldest son of William Gwavas, by Eliza, daughter of Sir Thomas Arundell of Tolverne, near Truro, he was born at Huntingfield Hall, Suffolk, 6 December 1676, and baptised in Huntingfield Church on 1 January following. He was articled to James Holt, an attorney in Lyon's Inn, and then entered the Middle Temple, where he purchased a ground chamber, No. 4 Brick Court. Gwavas moved back to Cornwall, living in a house in Chapel Street, Penzance. His father had left his Cornish property with debts, but he paid off the incumbrances, and redeemed the mortgage on the rectory of Paul. With this rectory he had inherited a chancery suit, begun on 14 June 1680, as to the right of the rector to take tithe of fish landed at Newlyn and Mousehole. The case came before the House of Lords on 26 February 1730, and went against the fishermen. Nevertheless, at the entrance to Newlyn there was for many years a notice affixed to a house which said \\"One and All, No tithe of fish\\". Gwavas was buried on 9 January 1741 in Paul Church, where a marble monument was erected to his memory. Works About 1710 Edward Lhuyd visited Cornwall, and conferred with Gwavas, Thomas Tonkin, and John Keigwin as to the formation of a \\"Cornu-British vocabulary\\". At this period they were the main authorities in the county on the old Cornish language, collectors of mottoes, proverbs, and idioms. In the dedication to Tonkin's Parochial History of Cornwall,' 1733, the only part of the work that was printed, the author said Gwavas had helped him with Cornish vocabulary and texts. Gwavas's Cornish writings in manuscript went to the British Museum (Addit. MS. 28554). His commonplace book, dated 1710, was in the sale of W. C. Borlase's library on 22 February 1887, and was purchased by Bernard Quaritch. Family On 29 April 1717 Gwavas married Elizabeth, daughter of Christopher Harris of St. Ives, Cornwall, with whom he received a portion of ¬£1,500. He left two daughters: Anne, who married the Rev. Thomas Carlyon, and died in 1797, and Elizabeth, who married William Veale, and died in 1791.

The older west wing was originally a tavern, built sometime before 1756 by Cornelius Bogert, when it also served as the town's meeting hall. It was bought in 1801 by John Frelinghuysen and then came to be known as the Frelinghuysen Homestead. It is an excellent example of early 19th century Federal architecture in New Jersey. In 1975, it was donated by Peter Frelinghuysen, Jr. to the borough and now serves as the Raritan Public Library. History The house has two historic sections: the main two-story brick house, built sometime after 1801, and an older frame wing on the west, built sometime before 1756. 1937 photo of older frame wing, on left Derrick Middagh bought the property on May 1, 1709 from Peter Van Nest. Cornelius Middagh then inherited it from his father, Derrick. Cornelius Bogert built a house here, which was used as a tavern, and served as the town's meeting hall from 1756 to 1769. The house was later sold to John Arrison and then to Henry Traphagen, before being bought by John Frelinghuysen. This forms the older west wing of the current building. John Frelinghuysen purchased the house from Traphagen in 1801, but , at the death of his father, Frederick, went to the Millstone family estate to manage the property there and take care of his brothers, Theodore and Frederick. He returned to this property in 1810. At some time he built the brick section of the building, using imported Dutch brick. He served in the War of 1812 and was promoted to brigadier general. see Gen. Frederick's eldest son, John section Thus the full name of the property is the General John Frelinghuysen House. The family sold the property in 1924 to the Glazier family. The house was renovated in the early 1970s by architect John M. Dickey. Architecture In 1936, the house was described as \\"a veritable mansion compared to the majority of Dutch houses.\\" It had an early 19th-century doorway and a neo-classic portico. The interior rooms had very high ceilings. Raritan Public Library The Raritan Public Library, founded June, 1961, was initially located in the Relief Home Company No. 2 Engine House.

It was organized on September 4, 1862, at Camp Butler near Springfield, Illinois, and was composed of men from DeWitt, Piatt, and Williamson Counties in central and southern Illinois. History The 107th Illinois left Camp Butler on September 30, 1862 and arrived at Jeffersonville, Indiana, where the officers were admonished that the men were a poorly-trained lot. This resulted in the regiment being held back in camp until October 12 while it was rigidly trained and prepared to head to the front. Crossing the Ohio River at Louisville, Kentucky, the regiment joined the Army of the Ohio commanded by General Don Carlos Buell. The army had just fought a tactically indecisive but strategically important action at the Battle of Perryville a week before. On October 18 the regiment was ordered to Elizabethtown, Kentucky (near the birthplace of President Abraham Lincoln) to repel a raid by Confederate cavalry under John Hunt Morgan. Here the Illinoisans received their baptism of fire, resulting in no reported casualties and the capture of several Rebels. The 107th spent the winter of 1862‚Äì1863 around Munfordville, Kentucky. In June 1863, the 107th was attached to XXIII Corps under command of Major General Ambrose Burnside. The regiment spent much of the summer of 1863 trying to chase down John Hunt Morgan and his band of Confederate raiders and participated in the capture of approximately 700 Rebels at Buffington Island, Ohio. Then they were sent to eastern Tennessee where they patrolled the area and confronted enemy troops under James Longstreet at Loudon, Tennessee, in early November. Longstreet's troops pushed northward and directly threatened the city of Knoxville until the Federals were reinforced by troops under William T. Sherman. The 107th participated in skirmishes at Campbell's Station on November 16 and Dandridge on December 21. On April 30, 1864, the 107th and the rest of the Army of the Ohio was attached to Sherman's command as it was beginning to push toward Atlanta. On May 14 and 15 they participated in the Battle of Resaca, suffering only minor casualties. Throughout the month of June the men participated in the fighting around Marietta, Georgia, including the bloody assaults on Kennesaw Mountain. They served in the trenches during the Battle of Atlanta in July and August and took part in the occupation of Decatur, Georgia in September. In late September John Bell Hood led his Army of Tennessee northward, hoping to draw Sherman out of Georgia by launching an offensive into Union-occupied Tennessee. The 107th and the rest of the Army of the Ohio under General John M. Schofield started north in pursuit. They passed over their old battlefields of Kennesaw Mountain and Resaca before being carried by rail to Nashville, Tennessee, in early November 1864. On November 18 their division, commanded by Brigadier General Thomas Ruger advanced to Columbia, Tennessee, to meet Hood's army. The regiment participated in skirmishing with Hood's army along the Duck River until November 28 when the army was ordered to retreat to Franklin, Tennessee. During the retreat, they participated in skirmishing along the Columbia Pike during the night of November 29 at the Battle of Spring Hill. The following day the army was in a defensive position surrounding Franklin, with Schofield hoping to delay Hood long enough for Union strength to be concentrated at Nashville. During the Battle of Franklin the regiment was near the apex of the Confederate assault and suffered heavy casualties, including the mortal wounding of their commander, Colonel Francis H. Lowrey. The 107th captured two stands of enemy colors and briefly suffered the loss of their own regimental colors, but they were recovered. During the night after the battle, Schofield's army retreated to Nashville and the regiment took a position near Fort Negley outside of Nashville. They performed skirmish and picket during the first two weeks of December and took part in the massive Federal assault on December 15 that resulted in the destruction of Hood's army. Remaining around Columbia, Tennessee, until late January, the regiment was then ordered to Washington, D.C. and then to Fort Fisher, North Carolina. They moved against Fort Anderson (North Carolina) and in a sharp skirmish captured the fort's colors. During March 1865 they served on guard duty in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, and rejoined Sherman's army near Goldsboro in April. After the surrender of Johnston's Confederate forces on April 26, the regiment remained on occupation duty in Salisbury, North Carolina, until June 21, 1865, when they were mustered-out. On July 2 the men arrived at Camp Butler, where they received their final pay and were discharged.

It is applied in asymmetric synthesis. Asymmetric synthesis has become a much explored field due to the challenge of creating a compound with a single 3D structure.El, G. M. T.; Williams, J. M. J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999, 3, 11‚Äì15. Even more challenging is the ability to take a racemic mixture and have only one chiral product left after a reaction. One method that has become an exceedingly useful tool is dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR).Pellissier, H. Tetrahedron 2008, 64, 1563‚Äì1601.Coldham, I.; Dufour, S.; Haxell, T. F. N.; Patel, J. J.; Sanchez-Jimenez, G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 10943‚Äì10951. DKR utilizes a center of a particular molecule that can be easily epimerized so that the (R) and (S) enantiomers can interconvert throughout the reaction process. At this point the catalyst can selectively lower the transition state energy of a single enantiomer, leading to almost 100% yield of one reaction pathway over the other. The figure below is an example of an energy diagram for a compound with an (R) and (S) isomer.Hanefeld, U.; Veum, L. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 2004, 15, 3707‚Äì3709. Energy diagram of an (R) and (S) isomer. With addition of a catalyst, one transition state (TS) is lower and thus becomes the kinetically favored pathway. If a catalyst is able to increase ŒîŒîG‚â† to a sufficient degree, then one pathway will dominate over the other, leading to a single chiral product. Manipulating kinetics therefore becomes a powerful way to achieve asymmetric products from racemic starting materials. There have been numerous uses of DKR in the literature that have provided new methods in pharmaceuticalsBlacker, J.; Headley, C. E. In Green Chemistry in the Pharmaceutical Industry; 2010; pp. 269‚Äì288. as well as routes to natural products.Goodyear, M. D.; Hill, M. L.; West, J. P.; Whitehead, A. J. Tetrahedron Lett. 2005, 46, 8535‚Äì8538. Applications Noyori's asymmetric hydrogenation One of the more classic applications of DKR is Noyori's asymmetric hydrogenation.Noyori, R.; Tokunaga, M.; Kitamura, M.; Ohkuma, T. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 1990, 1, 1‚Äì4. The presence of an acidic center between two carbonyl groups allows for easy epimerization at the chiral center under basic conditions. To select for one of the four possible stereoisomers, a BINAP-Ru catalyst is used to control the outcome of the reaction through the steric bulk of the phosphorus ligand. Some of the early transformations are shown below. Asymmetric hydrogenation of dicarbonyl systems using an (R)-BINAP-Ru catalyst. Epimerization is obtained through 2 equiv. of LDA. To further understand the stereochemical outcome, one must look at the transition state geometry. Transition states of dicarbonyl systems. (P-P= (R)-BINAP, X= Cl, H, H2, or solvent) The steric bulk of the BINAP ligand coupled with the coordination of ruthenium to the carbonyl oxygen atoms results in high selectivity for hydrogen insertion on one face. This resulting stereochemistry of (R,S) and (R,R) is obtained in 94.5% yield while the other three stereoisomers range from 0.5-3% yield. Noyori's accomplishments of 1990 paved the way for even more useful applications of DKR. Asymmetric conjugate reduction About a decade later, Jurkauskas and Buchwald also utilized dynamic kinetic resolution towards the hydrogenation of conjugated systems.Jurkauskas, V.; Buchwald, S. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 2892‚Äì2893. 1,4 addition to cyclic enones is quite common in many reaction schemes, however asymmetric reductions in the presence of an easily epimerizable center adds to the complexity when trying to modify only one center. Through the use of a copper catalyzed reaction however, Buchwald was able to obtain 1,4 reduction in great enantiomeric excess (ee). In order to achieve a high rate of epimerization, a strong bulky base like sodium t-butoxide was used to ensure rapid equilibrium. Dynamic kinetic resolution of 1,4 conjugate reduction. The rate-limiting step is the copper complex interaction with the double bond and the transfer of hydrogen. 1,4 conjugate reduction to cyclic enones. Copper proved to be an excellent metal in this reaction due to its ability to complex with the oxygen when the hydrogen was added. Being a soft metal, copper greatly prefers 1,4 addition over 1,2 addition, with the alkene being a softer more polarizable electrophile. Again, BINAP became the ligand of choice due to its steric selectivity, lowering the transition state energy of starting material in the left column. In addition, PMHS was used as a relatively less reactive silane. This prevented loss of ee before deprotection with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF). Asymmetric aldol reaction In addition to hydrogenation reactions, other bonds have been formed using DKR and are highly successful.Hayakawa, Y.; Hyodo, M.; Kimura, K.; Kataoka, M. Chem. Commun. 2003, 1704‚Äì1705.Hoffmann, S.; Nicoletti, M.; List, B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128,13074‚Äì13075.Makino, K.; Iwasaki, M.; Hamada, Y. Org. Lett. 2006, 8, 4573‚Äì4576. The aldol reaction has been extensively researched primarily because of the inherent challenge of forming a carbon-carbon bond.P√†mies, O.; B√§ckvall, J.-E. J. Org. Chem. 2002, 67, 9006‚Äì9010.P√§ivi√∂, M.; Mavrynsky, D.; Leino, R.; Kanerva, L. T. European J. Org. Chem. 2011, 2011, 1452‚Äì1457. Ward and colleagues have been able to use the proline-catalyzed aldol reaction in tandem with dynamic kinetic resolution to obtain a high enantioselective reaction.Ward, D. E.; Jheengut, V.; Akinnusi, O. T. Org. Lett. 2005, 7, 1181‚Äì1184. Stereoselective proline- catalyzed aldol reaction. In this reaction proline catalyzes the reaction through creation of an enamine intermediate that is highly nucleophilic. The acid group on the catalyst helps facilitate the carbon-carbon bond formation by coordinating with the aldehyde oxygen. This greatly improves stereoselectivity and yield. Ward and his associates also found that by adding trace amounts of water to the DMSO solvent, it greatly increase the yield of the reaction, most likely by aiding proton transfer from proline to the newly forming alcohol. Felkin Model of the transition state. The stereochemistry is determined by the directing hydrogen bond and increased distance between the bulky sulfur rings. The selectivity for this product can best be explained by the Felkin model. The cyclic (E)-enamine is able to undergo a favorable transition state where the aldehyde adopts an anti relationship relative to the incoming nucleophile, as well as a 1,2 syn relationship between the aldehyde and its adjacent ring system. The transition state is shown above. Enzyme-metal reactions More recently many research groups have tried to employ enzymes into DKR synthetic routes.Kim, M. J.; Ahn, Y.; Park, J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002, 13, 578‚Äì587.Huerta, F.; Minidis, A. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2001, 30, 321‚Äì331. Due to the generally high specificity for substrates, enzymes prove to be vital catalysts for binding to only one stereoisomer in the racemic mixture. In 2007 B√§ckvall discovered an enzyme-metal coupled reaction that converts allylic acetates to allylic alcohols with excellent stereospecificity.Mart√≠n-Matute, B.; B√§ckvall, J.-E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007, 11, 226‚Äì232. Enzyme-metal coupled hydrolysis of acetates in stereoselective fashion. Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) is the catalytic enzyme used to select for the (R) acetate. In this reaction, a Pd(0) complex is used to interconvert the chirality of the acetate center at a rate fast enough to ensure complete racemization. When this is achieved the CALB enzyme selectively hydrolyzes the (R) substrate because of the low binding affinity for the (S) substrate. This gives almost exclusively the (R) allylic alcohol in 98% ee. To expand on this chemistry, B√§ckvall designed a one-pot, two- reaction system that utilizes the stereochemical outcome of a DKR reaction to undergo a second energetically favorable reaction with high enantioselectivity. Tandem DKR-intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction. The ruthenium dimer facilitates racemization at the allylic position much like the Pd(0) catalyst. This time a ruthenium complex is used to racemize the allylic alcohol in much the same way as the previous example. The addition of CALB catalyzes the reaction between the (R) isomer and the ester reagent to form a product with a diene and a dienophile. This intermediate can then undergo a tandem Diels-Alder reaction to achieve a decent yield with 97% ee. Natural product synthesis Dynamic kinetic resolution has also been applied to the total synthesis of a variety of natural products. After B√§ckvall's discoveries in 2007, he employed another enzyme-metal coupled reaction to synthesize the natural product (R)-Bufuralol.Johnston, E. V; Bog√°r, K.; B√§ckvall, J.-E. J. Org. Chem. 2010, 75, 4596‚Äì4599. Condensed reaction scheme for (R)-Bufuralol showing the key DKR step in the synthetic pathway. The key step that the literature points out utilizes DKR to convert the chlorohydrin into the (S)-acetate by means of a lipase and a ruthenium catalyst. Acetylation reaction using a Ru catalyst to racemize the alcohol, followed by selective binding of the (S) isomer to the lipase PS-C ‚ÄúAmano‚Äù II. The lipase PS-C ‚ÄúAmano‚Äù II has been reported in the literature to be particularly enantioselective for the 1-phenyl-2-chloroethanol motif. The enzyme, along with the ruthenium catalyst, allows for rapid racemization of the chlorohydrin with a selective binding to the (S) isomer for the acetylation reaction. Here isopropenyl acetate is used as the acyl donor. The product is achieved in excellent yield (96%) and near-perfect enantiomeric excess (>99%). Conclusion With the number of asymmetric synthetic challenges increasing as new targets for pharmaceuticals and materials grow, methods development becomes critical.Han, J.; Kang, S.; Lee, H. K. Chem. Commun. 2011, 47, 4004‚Äì4006. Dynamic kinetic resolution is one solution to this ever growing demand, as one can take inexpensive racemic starting materials and come out with products in high yield and stereoselectivity.Ito, T.; Overman, L. E.; Wang, J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 3272‚Äì3273. As the scope and application of this powerful concept increases, its utilization in the industrial and academic settings is likely to expand in the years to come.

Dating from 1637, the sarai was originally built for travelers, as well as for caretakers of the Tomb of Jahangir. The sarai is most notable for being the best-preserved example in Pakistan, as well as for its large gateway that is richly embellished with pietra dura that serves as a portal to the tomb of Jahangir. Etymology The name can be translated as \\"Palace of Akbar\\". Abdul Hamid Lahori, court historian to the Emperor Shah Jahan, mentioned the building by the name Jilu Khana-e-Rauza, which means \\"attached court of the tomb\\", in his book the Padshahnama. Location The sarai quadrangle is situated in the middle of the Jahangir, to the east, and the east of Asif Khan which lies to the west of the sarai.  History  Despite the name of the structure, Akbari Sarai was begun during the reign of Islam Shah Suri in the mid 1550s, and not during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. The mosque at the sarai dates from the Suri period, though the cells which line the complex, and its gateways, date from the Shah Jahan period in the mid 1600s. The sarai served as both a station for wayfarers, and also a mail station known as a dƒÅk chowkƒ´. The sarai was administered by an official known as a ShƒÅhnƒÅ with several assistant caretakers. Fodder for animals, hot and cold water, and bed steads were provided free of charge. The sarai also had a physician, as well as a resident baker, and a water well located outside of the walls of the sarai. As with many sarais, a small bazaar may have run between each gate. Maharajah Ranjit Singh converted the complex into a cantonment of one of his foreign generals, Musa Farangi, who used to live here with his platoon. The site was severely damaged during the British era, when it was used as a rail depot following the construction of the nearby rail line.  Architecture  The building's red sandstone is richly decorated with pietra dura. The main portal features muqarna decoration. The sarai is in the form of an oblong quadrangle, which covers a total area of 12 acres. The sarai measures 797 feet by 610 feet. The courtyard of the sarai complex is flanked on all sides by a raised terrace where rows of 180 cells known as khanaha are located with a veranda and a common open passage. The corners of the sarai are flanked by towers. Tower chambers are the most elaborate of all the sarai's cells, and feature and elliptical hall in front with a veranda, with an octagonal room in the back. The palace has two large gateways in the Mughal style, located to the north and to the south that were built to be visible from a distance. The gateway is two stories, and housed the shƒÅhnƒÅ. The main arch serving as a portal to the tomb of Jahangir features a large double storied iwan, flanked by 4 other smaller arched niches featuring ghalib kari, or a network of ribs in stucco and plaster applied to curved surfaces in each archway. The central iwan is decorated with muqarnas. while the fa√ßade of the gateway is richly decorated with pietra dura. The decorative elements, the style of the structure, and the size of the bricks indicate that the palace and the gateways to the tomb could have been constructed at the same time. To the west of the palace in the middle of the cell rows is a mosque with three domes. It is clad in red sandstone with decorations. The interior of the mosque was probably once embellished with frescoes and ghalib kari as well. Conservation The Akbari Sarai, along with the Tombs of Jahangir and Asif Khan, were inscribed on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1993.

They were chiseled out of a calcareous sandstone outcropping during the regime of the Western Satraps. The caves are influenced by Buddhist and Jain cultures. The Buddhist cave include figures of Bodhisattva and the Jain cave includes figures of Adinath, Shantinath and PƒÅr≈õva. These are considered to be the earliest Jain sculptures in Kathiawad. Details of Jain Carvings This caves were carved in the 7th century A.D. and have a plain style of carving. This is one of the earliest rock cut cave of Gujarat. This place is also known as Dhankgiri and about 48 km of Junagadh in north west direction. on western side of the hill there are three niches. One niche is facing the door and another two are situated on either side of it. The door facing niche contains some Jain Images in kayotsarga and meditation posture. Most of Savior sculpture do not contain a clear cognizance or symbol of Tirthankara but according to H. D. Sanklia this image represents Rishabhnatha. On either side of Jina two whisk bearers are depicted and Jina is sitting on a lion throne or Simhasan. There are two another mediation posture images of Tirthankara saviors containing two whisk bearers on either side with serenity and tranquility on face. Triple canopies were depicted over the head of Jina. One of these image is depicted with Deer cognizance attributed to 16th Lord Shantinatha. One well preserved image of 23rd TIrthankara Parshvanatha is depicted in kayotsarga posture with long limbs parallel to body and cobra hood canopied. An image of Jaina yakshi ambika is also carved here who contains an infant in her arm and another with mango bud. from the ongoing discussion it is clearly evident that Dhank caves are attributed to Jainism and dwellers of these caves were Jain. Burgess did not say anything about the date of the Dhank caves but according to scholar H.D. Sanklia these caves could be hailed from 3rd Century AD after examining the Jaina sculpture's Style and Iconography. This cave is attributed to Digamabar Jain.

The Shana Dungar Buddhist Caves or simply called as Sana Buddhist Caves are located in Shana Vankiya in Una Taluka, Gir Somnath district of Gujarat, (which was recently carved out of Junagadh district), bordering with Rajula Taluka of Amreli district. Vankiya is located which is located 28 km far, north-easterly to Una town, about 38km south-easterly to Tulsishyam and 35km west of Rajula. There is another set of Sana Buddhist Caves in Veraval - Somnath region, which is also located in the newly former Gir Somnath district. These caves are simply called as ancient Buddhist caves of Prabhas Patan, and not so much as Sana caves. Nonetheless, information about these caves has gotten mixed up in the media. Sana Caves of Prabhas Patan are located about 7 km south-east of Vearval and 2km north-east of Somnath Mahadev mandir. Do not confuse the caves in Prabhas Patan with the majestic Shana Dungar Buddhist Caves at Vankiya, which are located about 105 km far, easterly from this place. Architecture of Shana Dungar Buddhist Caves, Una Taluk The rock cut carving includes 62 caves spread over the hill consisting stupas, chaityas, pillows and benches. The halls of few caves are dome-shaped and pillared. According to historians, the construction of caves had started by the 2nd century BC in Western India. Other historians have claimed that the architecture was constructed around the 1st century CE. A few historians have claimed that it is hard to trace the date of the caves' architecture. Sana Caves of Junagadh is a group of about 62 rock shelters which were carved out of soft rock. These caves were created in the period ranging between 1st century BC and 1st century AD and provided shelter to monks looking for refuge during the monsoons. Sana Caves are undoubtedly the oldest Buddhist caves in western India and boasts of rock cut pillars, stupas, benches, chaityas, viharas, a pillared hall and various domes. The shelters have been carved at various levels on and around a hillock. Some of the best archaeological symbols representing the preaching Buddhism can be seen at Sana Caves. The largest cave, Cave 2, is named Bhima-ni-Cori and is considered to be similar to Ebhala- Mandapa, which is located at Talaja. This cave is approximately 21 meters in depth and has a width of 18.3 meters. The ceiling is 5.3 meters high and provides ample space to tourists wishing to walk through them. It also has six pillars which are located between the pilasters in front. One of the pillars depicts unique features of a concave neck between the drum and the dome. Cave 26 and Cave 13 are different from the others. They have long verandahs with simple pillars resting on raised basements. These function as a support system for the beams above. The monasteries are also exquisitely designed with pillared verandahs which usually contain up to 4 cells at the back. The presence of benches around the hall is also an important feature of these caves. The layout of Cave 48 is very different from the rest. It contains two halls of different dimensions. These halls contain benches around their perimeter. Most of the caves were carved at different heights and levels in the spur and could be approached by simple stairs cut into the rock. The presence of multiple tanks in this group of caves bears evidence to the importance given to water harvesting. With rock cut walls present on three sides and an oblong mouth on the other, these tanks were perfect for retaining water during the bleaker seasons. This architectural design has also been noticed in the Kanheri caves near Mumbai in Maharashtra. These caves are distinctive in nature and are marked by their austere and simplistic designs. Most tourists notice a complete absence of engravings and ornate carvings‚Äîwhich are present in most of the other Buddhist caves in Gujarat. The caves also contain three chaitya grihas, which possess apsidal walls and flat ceilings. These caves are oft visited by tourists looking for deeper insights into the art forms and architectural designs of the Buddhist period. The caves are a focal point of interest for scholars, researchers and students too. A walk through Sana Caves takes you to exciting viharas, which refers to pillared verandahs containing one or two cells. These cells have rock cut benches inside them that were probably used for resting, sitting or taking shelter during the rains. Sana Caves is also known for its scenic beauty and provides a retreat to tourists wishing to enjoy the beauty and charm of the topographical landscapes beyond. History Footprints of Buddhism in Gujarat can be traced back to 270 BC. This was the period when Ashoka the Great ruled Saurashtra and was striving to spread the teachings and philosophy of Gautam Buddha across his empire. The ideology of Buddhism started gaining roots in various places in Gujarat, including Junagadh, Somnath, Velavar and the mouth of the River Indus‚Äîalong with a host of other far flung areas in the state. The accounts written by Chinese scholars and travelers of the likes of Hiuen Tsiang and I-Tsing bear testimony to the spread of Buddhism in these parts of the world. Buddhism started spreading across the nation and Gujarat in particular between the periods 27 B.C. to 470 A.D. Various archaeological remains and historical facts point to the development of embellishments and shelters in and around the areas of Somnath and Vadnagar. Sana Caves was the most prominent amongst them. These caves were located in the precincts of the Sana Hill, which is located 25 km north-east of Una and witnessed the rise and fall of a once flourishing monastery. With several water tanks and shelters to their credit, Sana Caves were constructed on the three slopes of an elevated plateau sloping down to the waters of River Rupen on the western face of the elevation. Architecture of Shana Buddhist caves of Prabhas Patan Buddhist caves of Prabhas Patan are simple in design and only two in number. These two caves are believed to a part of Buddhist vihara from the 3rd and 4th century AD. Each is about 8.7 m x 9.45 m, and 2.5 m high with four square pillars. An opening connects them at the rear. The eastern cave has an antechamber. Except for a row of niches on the outside there is no ornamentation. Buddhism, under Kshatrapa patronage was prevalent in the region during the early centuries of the Christian era.

The caves are situated at the foot of small hillocks on the banks of a spring. They are carved out of limestone rocks. There are three caves, the central one contains the stupa which is known as chaitya cave. There are two sculptures of Bodhisattva on the either sides of the gate of the chaitya cave.

In November 2016, GiveWell recommended that Good Ventures donate $4.5 million to the organization, out of Good Ventures' $50 million budget for GiveWell's top charities. In September 2015, GiveWell published a report based on field investigations carried out by Jacob Kushner and Anthony Langat of the National School-Based Deworming Program conducted by the government of Kenya with technical assistance from Deworm the World Initiative. The investigations were funded by GiveWell. They cited three concerns with the program: parents' and children's concerns about side effects of the deworming medication, religious concerns, and the fact that the program did not reach students not enrolled in school. Responding to the report, GiveWell said that it did not raise any red flags for its recommendation of Deworm the World Initiative.

A station for Yeadon was first proposed in 1881 when the North Eastern Railway were approached to build a line between Horsforth and Guiseley via Yeadon. The North Eastern declined to be involved so the promoters of the railway sought assistance from the Midland Railway instead. With some support from the Midland Railway, a company, the Guiseley, Yeadon & Rawdon, was formed and obtained, in 1885, an act of parliament to build a branch line from Rawdon Junction to Yeadon - a distance of just over one mile. In 1891 the company obtained parliamentary approval for an extension of the line to Headingley. At the same time the company changed its name to the Guiseley, Yeadon & Headingley Railway Company. Despite the additional powers the company was unable to raise the necessary capital to even build the line as far as Yeadon. Instead the Midland Railway took over the powers authorised by the earlier act and built the line from Rawdon to Yeadon. Yeadon station opened to goods traffic on 26 February 1894 and despite being equipped with all the necessary facilities for passengers, the Midland Railway did not introduce a regular passenger service on the line. Post-grouping the station came under the control of the London, Midland and Scottish railway who continued the practice of no regular passenger traffic although it was used for excursion trains until the 1950s. During the Second World War there was an increase in freight traffic due to an Avro aircraft factory being established at nearby Leeds-Bradford airport but in spite of this demand the line was closed as a wartime economy measure in 1944. After the war the line reopened but the amount of traffic was never great and a decision was made to close both the station and the branch line. The last train ran on 7 August 1964.

This plant disease commonly affects the leaves of olive trees worldwide. The disease affects trees throughout the growing season and can cause significant losses in yield. The disease causes blemishes on the fruit, delays ripening, and reduces the yield of oil. Defoliation and in severe cases, twig death, can occur, and the disease can have long-term health effects on the trees. Hosts Olive plants are the only known host of the pathogen, which is able to infect all olive cultivars, although different cultivars vary in their susceptibility. Young leaves are more likely to develop greater symptoms than intermediate or old leaves.\\"Disease Control.\\" The Olive Oil Source. N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Oct. 2013. Symptoms In late spring, dark spots appear on the upper surface of leaf cuticles in the low canopy.Vossen, Paul. Peacock Spot and Cerospora Foliar Diseases on Olive. California: UC Cooperative Extension, n.d. PDF. These spots are lesions produced by the infecting fungus, and later are the site of sporulation. Symptoms may also appear on the stem and fruit, but are most common on the leaf surface.Ferguson, et al. \\"How to Manage Pests.\\" UC IPM: UC Management Guidelines for Peacock Spot on Olive. N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Oct. 2013. As the season progresses, the dark spots grow to a size of between in diameter, with the emergence of a yellow halo around each spot. Plants may experience defoliation and in severe cases twig death. Blooms may also fail, resulting in significant reductions to crop production. Cerocospora leaf spot may appear in tandem with the development of peacock spot, as grey or ashy fungus signs, due to conidia on the bottom of leaves.\\"Pests and diseases\\". McevoyRanch.com. Disease cycle Spilocaea oleagina is a Deuteromycete because it has no known sexual stage. If the sexual stage exists and is discovered, it will belong to the genus Venturia. The mycelium typically develops on the leaf tissue. Lesions can be seen on the upper surface of leaves. The reproductive spores of Olive Peacock Spot that are known to exist are conidia. The disease is spread in several ways. The conidia can be spread by insects and the wind, and locally through rain water. The insect suspected of spreading Olive Peacock Spot is Ectopsocus briggsi, which is in the same order as lice. Olive trees keep their leaves year round. The primary infection occurs in the fall. The mycelia in leaf lesions infect the surrounding tissue and produce conidia for the primary infection. Sporulation from the leaf lesions spreads the conidia to healthy plant tissue. Young leaves are more susceptible to infection than older leaves. Sporulation continues during the winter and into the spring. The pathogen goes dormant during the hot, dry summer and survives as mycelium. The mycelia go dormant inside lesions on living leaves. Leaves that have dropped to the ground have also been known to produce infection from lesions, but this is not usually a significant source of infection. Environment Olive peacock spot disease is a worldwide agricultural problem and it thrives in similar conditions wherever it occurs. It depends on mild to low temperatures and free moisture to germinate and so it usually infects in the fall, winter, and spring. Hot and dry conditions in the summer cause the fungus to become inactivated and the leaf spots to turn white and crusted. During the summer, the diseased leaves fall leaving only the healthy ones on the partially defoliated trees. This provides a natural control for the disease. The disease also mainly infects young leaves in the spring. The presence of free moisture on the leaves is crucial for the conidia to germinate. This can occur in as little as 9 hours in the optimum temperature range, and usually in no more than 24 hours. Without free moisture, the conidia will not germinate. The preferred temperature range is , however it can persist between . Landscape can also affect the spread of olive peacock spot disease. It thrives in low-lying areas or in environments that receive little sunlight or have a closed tree canopy. Fog, dew, and high humidity are important factors. Under these conditions, this disease can spread even in summer. Nutrient deficiencies or imbalances in the soil have been linked to increased susceptibility. An excess of nitrogen and a calcium deficiency may weaken an olive tree's defenses. However, attempts to fix this with foliar nutrients and compost tea have not proven effective. Management Current practices in managing olive peacock spot disease aim for consistent suppression by keeping the levels of inoculum low through preventative measures. That is because there is no way to treat the disease once it appears in the spring or while the trees have fruit. The most common management approach is to spray the foliage with a copper compound after the fruit has been harvested in the fall, and again in the late winter if the environment is extremely wet. A power sprayer with high pressure is the most effective because it helps coat the entire surface of each leaf, even in the interior of the tree. If copper is sprayed on the fruit it is nearly impossible to wash away, so late harvests are often lost to infection. The spray comes in various forms of copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride, tribasic copper sulfate, and copper oxide. A few of those have been legally classified as organic. There are other commercially-available fungicides that don't contain copper, such as \\"Spotless\\", which is applied monthly as a foliar spray between harvesting and flowering. No olive varieties are completely resistant to the fungus, but susceptibility varies among cultivars. Partially-resistant varieties have been found to have genetic markers that can be used to select for resistant progeny.Mekuria, Genet., Et. Al. \\"Identification of Genetic Markers in Olive Linked to Olive Leaf Spot Resistance and Susceptibility\\". J. Amer. Soc. Horticultural Science 126.3 (2001):305-308. Information is usually listed in descriptions of varieties provided by the growers. Importance Losses of 10 to 20 percent of fruiting wood have been observed in plants highly infected with olive peacock spot. While the disease is not highly detrimental, it can cause chronic problems and severe economic losses in some olive orchards. These losses are significant in an industry that occupies 8.5 million hectares.\\"FAO, 2004\\". Apps3.fao.org. Retrieved 2009-05-18. References * Agosteo G.E., Schena L., 2011. Olive leaf spot.

According to G.J. Demko of Dartmouth College, \\"The fundamental premise of all [crime fiction] is a society that is ordered and real but becomes disordered as a result of a crime imposed on that society. In the normal case, a hero arrives - an officer of the law, a private detective or an amateur sleuth - and via logical deduction, hard work or luck, solves the crime, identifies the perpetrator, and order is restored.\\" However, Kenyan crime fiction differs slightly from Demko's definition because of the following reasons: crime is often so pervasive in societies portrayed in Kenyan crime novels that it becomes almost a part of the order (i.e., police bribes, corrupt government, etc.), and many times crimes are not conclusively solved by the end of the stories, mimicking the real-life cyclical nature of crime.  Popular Works  *Son of Women by Charles Mangua *Kill Me Quick by Meja Mwangi *Petals of Blood by Ngugi wa Thiong‚Äôo *Black Star Nairobi by Mukoma wa Ngugi *My Life in Crime, My Life with a Criminal, and My Life in Prison by John Kiriamiti *Links of a Chain by Monica Genya *The Mystery Smugglers by Mwangi Ruheni *Shortcut to Hell by Paul Kitololo  Context   Sociopolitical background of Kenyan crime fiction  Understanding the legacy of Kenya's colonial and postcolonial history is necessary in examining the historical, social and economic elements of Kenyan crime fiction. In 1895 Great Britain took up Kenya as a colony and named it the East Africa Protectorate. In 1963, Kenya gained its independence from the British Crown and effectively became a republic the following year. The country's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, a Kikuyu, took over property that belonged to wealthy white settlers and redistributed it amongst Kenyans, favoring the Kikuyu in particular. Although he claimed that the country had achieved ‚Äúpolitical stability‚Äù by strengthening its economy through tourism and other reforms, underlying social tensions between the Kikuyu and other minority groups (which counted altogether comprised a 70% majority) remained. Also, Kenya's rapid population growth, combined with the migration of people from rural areas to the cities, contributed to high rates of unemployment and law and disorder in urban areas. In 1978, after Kenyatta died, Daniel arap Moi began his infamous 24-year siege of power. Over the subsequent decades, economic growth declined and dropped under 4%, a dramatic drop from the growth rate of 6% during the early years of Kenyatta's presidency. According to Robert Shaw, a Nairobi economist quoted by the BBC, \\"From the 1990s, economic growth and the standard of living have declined or stagnated‚Ä¶. Moi's government promised many things but did very little - especially in the department of good governance.\\" As a result, many families fell below the poverty line, and the economic stagnation contributed to an already growing dissatisfaction aggravated by government inefficiency, corruption and ethnic tensions.  Themes  Common themes of postcolonial Kenyan crime fiction include:  Corruption  Corruption in Kenya spans from Kenyatta to Moi to Mwai Kibaki, and is a very prominent theme found in many Kenyan crime fiction novels. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, Kenya ranks 139th out of 179 nations. Often corruption manifests as bribes or informal payments to \\"get things done.\\" However, larger forms of corruption are also present, which are portrayed in crime fiction novels such as Ngugi wa Thiong‚Äôo's Petals of Blood. In Petals of Blood, Ngugi examines the failure of the postcolonial regime to uphold the principles that drove Kenyan independence: honor, populism and helping the poor. The Member of Parliament in the novel blatantly ignores the requests of the people of Ilmorog, and the businessman Kimeria takes advantage of Wanja and rapes her, symbolizing the African elite's rape of the continent. Mukoma wa Ngugi's novel Black Star Nairobi also highlights how the Kenyan presidential candidates urged young men of different ethnic groups to riot, loot and kill after the 2007 presidential election in the country. In the novel, such rhetoric prompts someone to bomb the Norfolk Hotel.  Portrayal of women  Kenyan crime fiction generally portrays women as secondary characters, usually as people to be dominated or as sexual objects. In Meja Mwangi's ‚ÄúKill Me Quick,‚Äù we are presented with two female characters, both only appear once, and both are only mentioned for their relationship to the main characters. Sarah, Razor's girlfriend, is there for Razor to have sex with in front of everyone, and Delilah, Mania's girlfriend, mentions her job is a barmaid, which we learn is another term for prostitute. Nici Nelson comments that ‚ÄúAll the female characters in Mwangi‚Äôs ‚ÄúKill Me Quick‚Äù are no more than ‚Äòscrews‚Äô of the main characters. In Charles Mangua's Son of Women, we learn that Dodge's mother and the woman who raised him were both prostitutes, as is the women he falls in love with. These three women are the only ones mentioned in the story for any length. The opening lines of the novel contain the lines, ‚ÄúI like to bite women-- beautiful women. Women with tits that bounce. If you do not like the idea you are the type I am least interested in.\\" From the beginning, Dodge is telling the reader that ‚Äúwomen with tits that bounce‚Äù are the only important kind of women, and if you don't fit that description, you aren‚Äôt beautiful and you don't matter. This theme continues throughout the novel.  Socioeconomic status conflicts  Prevalent in postcolonial Kenyan crime fiction are conflicts that arise as a result of socioeconomic status differences. This theme is rooted in the real- life disparity between the rich and poor in postcolonial Kenya, and the interactions between the two social strata. Socioeconomic standing in postcolonial Kenya tended to correlate with racial differences, with non- Kenyans largely being the richest and Kenyans accounting for a majority of the poor. Socioeconomic status conflicts are addressed in postcolonial Kenyan author John Kiriamiti's popular novel My Life in Crime. When describing a heist in which he is involved, narrator Jack Zollo remarks, \\"A little distance away, the Whiteman stopped and put his head through the window as if he was suspicious. Then he seemed to think G.G. was harmless and at a slow speed he approached the trap . . . The windscreen of the 404 broke into pieces. The Whiteman's hands were in the air, his eyes wide open. He asked us not to shoot him but to take the whole cash.\\" In addition to capitalizing \\"Whiteman\\" in order to situate the robbed as a racial \\"other,\\" the narrator also relays that the \\"Whiteman\\" is of a higher social class by mentioning his Peugeot 404 and \\"whole cash.\\" Wealth and race are clearly inflated and serve as a motivation for less fortunate Kenyans like Zollo to rob those in better socioeconomic standing, who tend to be of a different race.  Writing style  Some writing stylistic differences are present in Kenyan novels. Often, writers use exposition, summarization, and description, rather than the principle show, don't tell of fiction writing. For example, Monica Genya's Links of a Chain is written in third person omniscient, and Genya's writing focuses on telling the audience about detailed actions and elaborate backstories. Reviewer for World Literature Today James Gibbs writes on the novel's perception of reality: ‚ÄúThe author is more interested in action than character or community. As in other examples of the convention, there is, for example, little attempt to show the repercussions of violence on the wider community, and agents undertake casually dangerous assignments with inadequate backup. There is almost no attempt to explore the impact of brutal killings and scenes of carnage on the perpetrators and witnesses.

Service The regiment was formed of men from Union County, Illinois, Alexander County, Illinois, Jackson County, Illinois, Johnson County, Illinois, and Pulaski County, Illinois. The men were organized at Camp Anna near Anna, Illinois and were mustered into service on September 11, 1862. From the beginning the regiment suffered from low morale, which was exacerbated by being issued \\"inferior\\" weapons. The regiment remained in Anna until October 20, when it was ordered to Cairo, Illinois and then to Columbus, Kentucky. It joined the Army of the Tennessee commanded by Major General Ulysses S. Grant and spent most of the fall guarding railroads and supplies around in west Tennessee. Due to poor organization and the dismal state of their weapons they were deemed unfit for combat and spent most of the rest of the winter at Holly Springs, Mississippi and Memphis, Tennessee. Traveling with the rest of the Army of the Tennessee down the Mississippi River in preparation for the assault on Vicksburg. Morale continued to plunge while the 109th was at Lake Providence, Louisiana and the number of deserters climbed to 237. High command decided that the regiment would be better if it was disbanded and broken up. Most of the officers were sent home or to other commands, and the remaining men were transferred to the 11th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Casualties During the short-term of service for the 109th Illinois, they never saw combat and lost 2 officers and 92 men died by disease. These losses were augmented by the desertion of at least 237 men.

The ship was launched in November 2013 and commissioned in May 2014. She is named after Irish playwright and author Samuel Beckett. Like other OPVs in the Irish Naval Service, the ship's primary mission is fisheries protection, search and rescue, and maritime protection operations, including vessel boardings. Development Design In October 2010, the Irish Naval Service ordered a number of new offshore patrol vessels from Babcock Marine, a UK-based shipbuilder operating out of Appledore, North Devon. The first two vessels were named Samuel Beckett and respectively, and planned to replace (decommissioned September 2013; sold October 2013) and (decommissioned January 2015; commissioned in the Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta June 2015). Like the R√≥is√≠n-class OPV, Samuel Beckett was designed by Vard Marine to a VARD 7 series design. Although similar to the R√≥is√≠n-class OPV, Samuel Beckett is over longer, intended to increase its capabilities in the rough waters of the North Atlantic. The ship is designed to carry a crew of 44 and have space for up to 10 trainees. Additionally, Samuel Beckett is designed to carry remotely operated submersibles and a decompression chamber for divers. The expanded deck area would allow the ship to deploy unmanned surveillance planes. Construction and naming Although the ship was built using modern modular construction techniques, the keel was deemed to have been \\"laid down\\" during a keel-laying ceremony held at the Appledore Shipbuilding Yard on 19 May 2012 after the first two major components were connected together. In July 2013, while still under construction, the name of the vessel, Samuel Beckett was announced by the Minister for Defence Alan Shatter in D√°il √âireann. Propulsion The ship is powered by a pair of 16-cylinder W16V26F W√§rtsil√§ diesel motors driving twin shafts that propel a top speed of . The ship is also equipped with dynamic positioning systems and a power take-in (PTI) drive, to enable fuel savings as the main engines can be shut down and switched to alternative power sources such as stored battery power or a smaller more economical engine. Operational history The ship was completed and floated out of the shipyard in November 2013, delivered in April 2014 and commissioned for service in May 2014. The vessel was \\"twinned\\" with Cork city in a ceremony held on 7 June 2014. In late 2015 Samuel Beckett was deployed to the Mediterranean as part of Ireland's contribution to the humanitarian response to the European migrant crisis. During the ship's cruise, more than 1,000 migrants were rescued. In one event, 111 people were rescued in a United Nations operation off the coast of Libya. The vessel was redeployed to the area in 2016, and on 17 November 2016 rescued 50 migrants who were on a rubber boat 25 Nautical Miles North-west of Tripoli. This brought the number of migrants rescued by the Samuel Beckett to 2310. In March 2020 the Naval Service provided the vessel to the HSE as a testing centre to be docked at Sir John Rogerson's Quay as part of Irish response to the coronavirus panademic.

The library, which is located at the foot of the McKinley National Memorial, is owned and operated by the Stark County Historical Society, and located in Canton, Ohio, where McKinley built his career as lawyer, prosecuting attorney, congressman, governor and president. The museum contains the largest collection of McKinley artifacts in the world and chronicles the life and career of the 25th President, from his birth to his death at the hands of an assassin. Another exhibit also explores the construction of the Memorial and the unfortunate fate of the McKinley‚Äôs Canton home, destroyed by fire in 1937. As for the Museum itself it boasts a science center with some wildlife and fossils. The museum has a temporary exhibit space called the Keller gallery. The museum also has an planetarium show. Because of the science center, the museum has a membership plan that lets the member access other museums meeting the same criteria throughout the United States. The museum also houses other artifacts on the surrounding city. The museum largely relies on volunteer staff for its operations. The current curator is Kimberly Kenney.  Hoover-Price Planetarium  The Hoover-Price Planetarium was built during 1962, opened in July 1963, and stands adjacent to the McKinley National Memorial in Canton, Ohio. The Planetarium is housed within the McKinley Presidential Library & Museum. The primary influence in the design and development of the planetarium was Richard Emmons (1919-2005), senior engineer in the Astronautics Department at Goodyear Aircraft Corporation, and past program director and lecturer at Morehead Planetarium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Asteroid 5391 Emmons (1985 RE2) was named in Emmons honor. The central opto-mechanical star projector, a Spitz Model A-3-P, was enhanced by Emmons to show an additional 1,500 stars. Except for the dome and the sound system, all of the original equipment was purchased from Spitz Laboratories. The dome was made and installed by Astro-Dome, Inc., of Canton. It measures 7.2 meters in diameter and is made of aluminum structural beams covered by a perforated aluminum screen. The planetarium has 60 auxiliary projectors, including solar and lunar eclipses, meteors, life cycle of stars, double stars, Aurora Borealis, rainbows, the Milky Way galaxy, views of the moon and sunrise and sunset. The construction of the planetarium was and remains privately funded. It is named after the two families whose donations made the project possible, the Hoover family and company and Mr. and Mrs. Harley C. Price. The planetarium has undergone few changes since 1964, except for the addition of two DLP projectors and a computer to generate images. Richard Emmons' son, Thomas Emmons, Emeritus Professor at Kent State‚Äôs Physics Department, continues to maintain the planetarium. The current director is David L. Richards, with a part-time staff of four program lecturers. All programming is accomplished in-house.

It takes its name from the biblical family of the same name. The band is known for putting Psalms to music. The lyrics for their songs are taken almost verbatim from the book of Psalms. As of 2014, the band has interpreted over 50 of the 150 Psalms into songs. Speaking of the band's focus on the Psalms, founder Matthew Jacoby said \\"...the psalms are important today because we tend to romanticise spirituality a lot and these songs present biblical spirituality in its original form, very real and yet present in such stunning poetic form. It is a perfect blend of spiritual realism with aesthetic and artistic integrity.\\"  History  Sons of Korah formed in 1994 while founding members Matthew Jacoby, Jason Coghill and Rod Gear attended the Reformed Theological College in Geelong. In 1996 the band recorded their first album Hand to the Plough. After this release, Coghill officially left the band, however he returned briefly to help record their first widely distributed album Light of Life in 1998. Light of Life was recorded live in the studio on analogue reel-to-reel. As a solo artist, Coghill has continued to record music based on the Psalms. Redemption Songs was released in November 2000. It is often cited as the band's most popular album. 2001 saw the release of a box set of their recorded albums. The box set included a re-recorded EP version of their first album Hand to the Plough. In 2002 Marcus Hayden left the band to pursue a solo career. Jayden Lee joined in 2004 and helped write many of the songs for their next album Resurrection. Gear did not participate in the recording of this album or its subsequent tour while he worked on a solo album. Lee left the band in 2008 and moved to the United States. Mike McCarthy then joined as the group's lead guitarist. Gear also returned to the band after recording a solo album Barak. After appearing on a number of albums as a backing vocalist, Ann-Maree Keefe joined Sons of Korah on tour and often opens their concerts as a solo artist. Rain was released in 2008. A reviewer commented on the \\"amount of light and shade\\" in the album, with another calling it \\"An enthralling musical journey through some of the Bible‚Äôs most enduring psalms\\".

The glen is a deep gorge cut through the sandstone of the south flank of the Baraboo Hills. It was the first State Natural Area to be designated in Wisconsin. The valley was named for Robert Parfrey.  Location and access  Parfrey's Glen is located approximately 5 miles north of Merrimac, Wisconsin. Though within the boundaries of Devil's Lake State Park, it cannot be accessed by vehicle from the rest of the park. A trail (1.6 mi roundtrip) leads north into the natural area ending at a small waterfall. The Ice Age Trail also passes through the site. However, heavy rainstorms in 2008 and 2010 destroyed the boardwalk that made up the last part of the trail in the gorge. The boardwalk was not replaced and the trail is now along the streambed for the portion of the hike in the gorge.  Description  The exposed sandstone walls of Parfrey's glen contain pebbles and boulders of embedded quartzite. The walls were covered with moss and remained moist from seepage before the 2008 floods, which washed away nearly all vegetation in the glen. The mosses and ferns have yet to grow back as of September 2016. The glen has a cool and shaded climate. This results in a flora more typical of northern Wisconsin with yellow birch, mountain maple, and red elder and several rare plant species, including the federally threatened northern monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense) and state- threatened round stemmed false foxglove (Agalinus gattingeri). Additional rare species found here include cliff goldenrod (Solidago sciaphila), and two state-threatened birds, the cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea) and Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens). The fast and cold hardwater stream, Parfrey's Glen Creek, flows through the gorge and harbors a rare species of diving beetle (Agabus confusus) and a rare caddisfly (Limnephilus rossi).

Early life Cecilia Makiwane was born in 1880 at the MacFarlane Mission in Victoria East, a district about 10km away from Alice in what was the Cape Colony.Steensma, DP, Shampo, MA and Kyle, RA. 2005. Cecilia Makiwane‚ÄîPioneer African Nurse. Volume 80, Issue 4. pp 449. Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Her father was Reverend Elijah Makiwane, a pioneering clergyman and the second Black minister ordained in the Presbyterian Church who was trained in South Africa. Her mother Maggie Majiza was an assistant teacher at a girls‚Äô school in Alice. Maggie died in 1883 when Cecilia was two years old. Her parents had three children, Daisy (1878), Cecilia (1880) and Ashton (1882). Cecilia attended the Lovedale Girls' School where she obtained a teacher's certificate. Her niece Noni Jabavu became a well-known novelist. Education The Victoria Hospital, the first mission hospital in South Africa, opened in 1898 and closed during the Boer War. The hospital reopened in 1903 and launched a three-year nurse training programme in the same year. In 1907, Mina Colani and Makiwane both enrolled and received a Hospital Proficiency Certificate after three years. Makiwane enrolled for a further year of trainingFalola, T and Niyi A, eds. 2007.

She became the first Black woman to be a licensed by the state as a professional nurse in Africa in January 1908. When she received her license, the only other women of colour who were trained as nurses were Maori women in New Zealand.Estherhuizen, JM. 2012. The Professional Development of Black South African Nurses 1908‚Äì1994: A Historical Perspective. University of South Africa. Nursing in South Africa Bantu nursing was introduced with the growing need for Xhosa people in King William‚Äôs Town to have nurses who shared their cultural background. This led to Makiwane qualifying as a professional nurse in 1908.Harrison, PH. 1979. Curationis: Vol 2, No 2. Salute to some nursing pioneers. University of Cape Town. Accessed 13 August 2017. At the time, only 6% of Black women in the country could read and write. Only those with nine to 10 years of schooling could register. Makiwane had nine years of schooling before she started the training course. The lack of adequate schooling for Black people hindered many from entering the field which required to pass a written examination in English or Afrikaans. In 1910, the government started training more Black women. Under colonial rule, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State commenced nurse training for Black women in the 1930s and 1950s, respectively. Other mission hospitals also trained more Black women in order to provide healthcare in rural areas. The field was only gradually opened to Black women with 255 Black nurses training nationwide in 1937. By the 1940s, there were only about 800 registered Black nurses in the country. By 1990, of the approximately 15 000 nurses who were registered with the South African Nursing Council, about two-thirds were people of colour. Activism In 1912, Makiwane took part in what was probably the first women's anti-pass campaign. In this campaign, a petition was signed by some 5000 African and mixed-ancestry women in the Free State (province). It was sent to Louis Botha demanding for the pass laws to be repealed. Retirement She resumed work with the Lovedale Hospital and served the hospital until she was granted long leave due to ill health. Death and legacy After leaving Lovedale she joined her sister, Majombozi in Thaba ‚ÄòNchu where she eventually died in 1919 at the age of 39. A statue of Cecilia Makiwane was erected by the nurses of South Africa at the Lovedale Hospital in 1977. A postage stamp was issued in 1982 to honour local heroine Cecilia Makiwane by the short-lived republic \\"Ciskei\\", now known as the Eastern Cape. The Cecilia Makiwane Nurse's Recognition Award for health care professionals, was introduced by the South African government in 2002 in her honour. Cecilia Makiwane Hospital in Mdantsane township in the Eastern Cape has been named after her.

It was designed by New York City-based architect Donald G. Anderson, with Louis A. Simon as the supervising architect. The building differed from most New Deal era federal buildings in its use of an outside architect. It is also significant due to a mural located inside, completed by the artist Winfield R. Walkley, titled \\"Cotton and Peach Growing\\". It is one of 13 mural that had been commissioned by the US Department of Treasury's Section of Fine Arts between 1938 and 1941 for South Carolina federal buildings and post offices. The building operated as a post office until 1964, when a new one was built. It was sold to the city of Greer, who renovated the building to serve as the Greer City Hall.

Winscott House was built or re-built in 1865 and was demolished after 1931. Winscott was a seat of the Stevens family also of Velstone, in the parish of Buckland Brewer and Cross, in the parish of Little Torrington, the latter existing today as a large Georgian mansion about 2 miles south of Great Torrington. House There must have been a house at Winscott for several centuries ‚Äì it was the home of the Stevens family, long prominent in Torrington. The family also owned Cross, a large house on the outskirts of that town. The old Winscott property had vanished by October 1865 when plans for a large Victorian mansion for Mr J. C. Moore-Stevens were published in The Builder. The new house was built of local yellow brick from the Marland clay works nearby. Said to have cost over ¬£7,000, the building incorporated a central hall almost 30 feet square. Left empty in 1920, it was finally demolished and all that remains today is a flat area in the middle of a field.

It played for a 7-month sold-out run, and was seen by more than 40,000 people,http://punchdrunk.com/#past-shows/article/the-masque-of-the-red-death involving a cast of around 35 and utilising almost all of the space within the Battersea Arts Centre building. The narrative was based on the short stories of Edgar Allan Poe, including but not limited to \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" (1842). The production fell within several genres of theatre, including site- specific theatre, promenade theatre, interactive theatre and immersive theatre. The audience members, who were free to roam around the sets at will, wore white masks to distinguish themselves from the cast who were maskless and the stewards/staff who wore discreet black masks. The narrative was communicated through a series of overlapping scenes blending the mediums of interpretive dance, contemporary dance and traditional acting. Following the show on Friday and Saturday nights throughout the run were \\"Red Death Lates\\", an open after-party for show attendees and others, involving members of the cast together with changing external entertainment. The move from the main theatre show through to the afterparty was handled seamlessly by virtue of the fact that the final scene in The Masque Of The Red Death involved a party in the main hall in celebration of the passing of the eponymous plague. Although the main elements of the show were a collaboration between Punchdrunk and the Battersea Arts Centre, the production also commissioned other artists and groups to create hidden set pieces within the performance in response to themes of the main show, including Kneehigh, Blind Summit, Julian Fox, Kazuko Hohki, Hannah Ringham and BAC's Young People's Theatre.  Narrative  Despite the title, the show was actually based on eight Edgar Allan Poe tales, including \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\", \\"The Black Cat\\", \\"William Wilson\\", \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\", \\"Berenice\\", \\"Ligeia\\", \\"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\", \\"The Telltale Heart\\" and \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\". The show did not utilise a central narrative beyond the loose themes of The Masque Of The Red Death, but rather encouraged the audience to experience short sections of acting and dance described in the Financial Times as \\"an impressionistic collage of several of Edgar Allan Poe‚Äôs stories rather than anything resembling a linear drama\\". The audience were encouraged to explore the space in their own way by roaming individually, making active choices about their experience and exploring the work of the artists on their own terms. Beyond the individual performances and setpieces themselves, audience members could enrich their understanding of the narrative by interacting with the hundreds of detailed props, such as notes, messages, diaries and labels.  Venue  The venue for the show was the Old Town Hall (built 1893), Lavender Hill, Wandsworth, London, home to the Battersea Arts Centre since 1965 The show utilised almost all of the building, relying in particular on areas that were not usually used for performance or even accessible by the public, such as corridors and offices - \\"Punchdrunk enabled us to look at the Old Town Hall Building with fresh eyes, seeing the potential in every room, corridor, stairwell and cupboard, opening up areas that had been shut away for years\\" (Battersea Arts Centre Website). Locations within the venue included an opium den, a 19th-century French-inspired music hall (\\"The Palais Royale\\"), a library, perfumery, morgue, banqueting hall, bedrooms and a crypt.  The Gold-Bug Hunt  The Gold-Bug Hunt was a game by interactive theatre-makers Coney that took place online, in the \\"real world\\", and within The Masque of the Red Death. It ran for six months, extending past the end date of the show itself. Participants initially discovered the game by interacting with a mysterious masked and hooded figure within the Palais Royale bar area of the show. Coney transposed a mystery based on another Edgar Allan Poe short story, \\"The Gold-Bug\\", onto the narrative and locations used in the Masque of the Red Death, and took advantage of the fact that the Old Town Hall building dated back to 1893, 50 years after the publication of the story (treated as a factual account within the narrative), to weave fiction together with reality. Like the story upon which it is based, the Gold-Bug hunt relied on the decryption of ciphers and puzzles to lead the participants to the \\"treasure\\", which was finally discovered by a group of participants buried in a garden within the confines of the Battersea Arts Centre, and upon which the Old Town Hall had been built. However, in order to reach this point, it was necessary for the participants to work together and interact with the sets, props, and at times the actors themselves, within the Masque of the Red Death show, as well as by solving puzzles online.

The state library was selected as the home of the new organization.The Virginia Library Association: A Retrospective http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/VALib/v51_n3/altshuler.html Membership VLA membership is open to any person, organization, or library. Honorary Life Memberships may be bestowed upon nominated individuals selected by the Awards and Recognition Committee, approved by the Executive Committee, and affirmed by VLA members on the annual ballot. Organizational structure The Council of the Virginia Library Association is the governing body of the organization. A quorum consists of one half of the voting members of the Council plus one. The elected officers of the VLA comprise the Executive Committee. Those positions include: President, Vice President/President-elect, Second Vice President, Immediate Past President, Secretary, and Treasurer. The Executive Committee designates an Executive Director. Advocacy The VLA has been a strong advocate in support of adequate funding for libraries, convincing the Virginia General Assembly to appropriate $50,000 for public libraries in the first such law to establish state aid in 1942. In the 1950s and 60s, the VLA took a stand to combat censorship and support intellectual freedom. In the 1970s, the VLA encouraged its members to become involved in letter writing campaigns to legislators and began participating in the annual Library Legislative Day, when members travel to Washington, D.C. to advocate concerns to congressmen and senators. Major publications Virginia Libraries was launched in April 1928 and initially served as the unofficial vehicle of the Virginia Library Association.

Despite the prairie's relatively small size, 130 native prairie plant species have been documented on the site. Many of these species are quite showy, including wood lily, shooting star, fringed puccoon, pasque flower, butterfly weed, and compass plant. Several rare species are also found on the site, including pomme-de-prairie, white camas, striped hairstreak, and the state- threatened species rough-stemmed false foxglove (Agalinis gattingeri) and regal fritillary. The original land-surveyor records for the area indicate presettlement vegetation was treeless prairie. Following settlement in the area, the prairie escaped plowing, although some grazing undoubtedly occurred, and old tractor furrows can still be seen along the top of the ridge. The most recent private owners preserved the prairie for over 40 years. The gradual decline of the prairie over this time, as well as the owners' desire to preserve it, led to the Nature Conservancy's purchase of the prairie in 1986, below market value. Restoration of the prairie soon commenced, and in 2003, management was taken over by the Prairie Enthusiasts, an organization dedicated to preserving and restoring native prairie remnants.

Sir John Perceval, 1st Baronet (7 September 1629 ‚Äì 1 November 1665) was a substantial land owner in Ireland. He was knighted by Henry Cromwell for his services to the Commonwealth government of Ireland during the Interregnum. Shortly before the Restoration he held the offices of Chief Prothonotary of the Common Pleas and Clerk of the Crown. After the Restoration he was granted a baronetcy and given a full pardon for his activities during the Interregnum. He was appointed Privy Councillor to King Charles II, a Knight of the Shire for County Cork, and was a member of the Council of Trade. Early life John Perceval was born on 7 September 1629 in Dublin. He was the eldest son and heir of Sir Philip Perceval (1605‚Äì1647) (the son of Richard Perceval) and of Catherine, the daughter of Arthur Usher of Dublin, and grandson to George Perceval. He was tutored in the home counties of England alongside Lord Inchequin's eldest son who had been placed under the guardianship of Sir Philip Perceval while his father was engaged in the Civil War in Ireland. John Perceval went to Cambridge University in February 1646 when he was sixteen. While at Cambridge he met and befriended Henry Cromwell. His father died the following year, and John Perceval decided that, with wars raging in both England and Ireland, he would remain at university and so remain out of public life to avoid choosing sides in the wars. In 1649, after the execution of Charles I, the rebellion in Ireland was crushed by the New Model Army under the command of Oliver Cromwell. Given Perceval's large holdings in Ireland, he thought it politic to return to protect his interests. This was difficult because his father had opposed the English Independents who were now in the ascendancy. As well as protecting his lands, Perceval proposed to marry the daughter of the Speaker of the Rump Parliament William Lenthall who would then protect his estates for the benefit of his daughter. However, with the diminution of Lenthall's influence within the Commonwealth, the marriage fell through. Perceval's father Sir Philip Perceval, was in the Irish government and originally supported Cromwell. However he later opposed the New Model Army. On his death, Cromwell calculated that his son could be of use and he protected John Perceval's interests in the short term, hoping to use him as an ally in the longer term. The first example of this support occurred in England in 1650 when the Somerset sequestration committee proposed that Perceval's holdings in Somerset should be sequestrated. The matter was taken up in London and, through Cromwell's intervention, settled in favour of Perceval. In Ireland, the Commonwealth sequestered all of Perceval's estates. Perceval prevented absolute confiscation and as his interests improved, this severity relaxed. However he was obliged to pay large sums to the Commonwealth. For example, in the year 1 May 1650, to 1 May 1651 for his Munster estate, he contributed ¬£1,965 and, in the following year, his contribution amounted to ¬£200 more than the estate produced. First Commonwealth Once Sir John Perceval was of age, he laid claim to all of his father's estates in Ireland, amounting to seventy-eight and a half Knight's Fees, containing 101,000 acres, of some of the best land in Ireland. There were holdings in the counties of: Cork, Tipperary, Catherlough, Waterford, Kerry, Mayo, Kildare, and Dublin. There were some other estates over which he had control, some were already in his possession, some belonged to his mother, and he was also paid a small amount of rent from housing in Dublin City. Oliver Cromwell, who was in Ireland finishing his campaign against the Irish confederates and Royalists, supported Perceval in his claim. When Cromwell left Ireland in the middle of May 1650 to take the war to Scotland, (and on to the Commonwealth's ultimate victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651), Henry Ireton, his son-in-law, remained in Ireland as Lord Deputy in Cromwell's place. Militarily he met little further resistance and was left with a mopping up operation. After his death, his successor, Edmund Ludlow, was faced with even less effective military opposition, and after Charles Fleetwood arrived in Ireland with supreme command, the English establishment was confident enough of their hold on Ireland that the English Parliament declared the rebellion totally subdued on 26 September 1651. The next issue facing the English Parliament was what sort of settlement to impose on Ireland. This included a High Commission to try those who had been in arms against the Commonwealth, many of whom were transported and their lands sequestrated, and the banishing of known Roman Catholics to Connaught and the confiscation of their lands. Oliver Cromwell sent Sir John Perceval to assist General Charles Fleetwood with this task. Fleetwood was impressed with Perceval's service, and wrote to England saying as much. In recognition of this service, Perceval was granted the office of King's Bench, which had been sequestrated with his estate from the time of his father's death. On 6 July 1653 the office of Commissioners of Revenue was told to allow him to receive the entire income from his estates. To provide a suitable living for himself, to pay off some of his father's debts, and to form a dowry for his sister, he sold 15,000 acres of his best land in a depressed market. Protectorate In December 1653 the Council of Officers introduced a written constitution into the Commonwealth called the Instrument of Government and under its provisions declared Oliver Cromwell Lord Protector. Perceval travelled to London in May 1654 and while there renewed his friendship with Henry Cromwell and had an audience with Oliver. He was invited to sit in the First Protectorate Parliament but declined because he thought that his public and private commitments in Ireland should take priority. When he saw what a debacle the First Protectorate Parliament had become, Perceval decided to distance himself from the regime concluding that it could not last. He had been working with Roger, Lord Broghill and one of his tenants, Vincent Gookin, in the interests of the Commonwealth but, on his return from England in July 1655, he retired to his castle at Lifcarrol and tried to keep out of public affairs as much as possible. It was during this sojourn that he married and started a family (see below). He worked to improve his estates by inviting Protestant farmers to take up tenancies while retaining Roman Catholic tenants who had proved loyal to his family during the rebellion. When his friend Henry Cromwell arrived in Ireland as the New Deputy Governor, Perceval had no choice but to take a more active role in government as to do otherwise would have aroused suspicion. In November 1656 Oliver Cromwell appointed him one of the \\"commissioners of the Security of his own Person and Continuation of the Nation in Peace and Safety\\". This meant that Royalist supporters saw Perceval as one of the stalwarts of the Protectorate. Cromwell invited Perceval to sit in Cromwell's Other House but he declined. Despite this he was knighted by Henry Cromwell on 22 July 1658 for his services to the Commonwealth. Second Commonwealth It was largely due to the counsel of Perceval, that Henry Cromwell stayed out of the anarchy that engulfed England after the death of his father; in particular his passive behaviour over his elder brother Richard's removal from the office of Lord Protector. This political move by Perceval stood him in good stead during the brief return of the Long Parliament and the Convention Parliament. In turn, he was appointed one of the four councillors to the President of Munster, and appointed by those commissioned by the President to manage the government of Ireland, Clerk of the Crown, Prothonotary of the Common-Pleas, and Keeper of the Public Accounts on 7 May 1660 preceding the return of the King on the 29th of the same month. Restoration Soon after the restoration of the monarchy he was sworn in as a member of the Privy-Council, and on 9 September 1661 created Baronet Perceval of Kanturk. To secure his position, and so that his political enemies could not in the future use his conduct under the Commonwealth to attack him, Perceval obtained a Patent of Special Pardon for all treasons, rebellions, etc. and for all engagements, of which he might have been guilty, either under the Parliament of the Commonwealth, or the Protectorate, from the beginning of his life, to 29 December 1660. The Patent was dated Westminster, 22 April 1662 and was passed under the Great Seals of England and Ireland. In 1661 Perceval was appointed Knight of the Shire for County Cork, and served in the Irish Parliament. In 1662 the parliament concluded the Act of Settlement in Ireland, which initiated the settling of outstanding constitutional issues for the next century or more. In 1662 Perceval failed to prevent the passing of The Tenures Abolition Act which abolished feudalism in Ireland and the Court of Wards. This resulted in a loss to the Perceval family of ¬£3,400 per annum. He received ¬£5,000 as compensation. In 1663 a plot by Colonel Jepson and some other former republican officers was discovered. Perceval was appointed foreman of the jury at their trial. Council of Trade Catherine (1 September 1637 ‚Äì 17 August 1679) the only daughter of Sir Robert Southwell of Kinsale, wife of Sir John Perceval, 1st Baronet. Engraved by I Faber Fecit (1743). In 1664 Perceval was appointed to a Council of Trade to explore how trade between Ireland, Scotland and England could be enlarged as the Irish economy was in recession at that time. Since he held considerable properties in England as well as Ireland, he was an energetic committee member, and was considered to be less partisan than most. Death While in England following up trade issues in 1664, he fell ill and returned to Ireland to see his wife who was also very ill. He lived long enough to see her but died soon afterwards, aged 36, on 1 November 1665 in Dublin and was buried in St. Audoen's Church, within the burial vault of his great-grandfather Sir William Usher. Perceval had intended to build a church at Burton, County Cork, and a magnificent monument had been designed to be erected there so it was thought sufficient at that time to place a simple memorial stone over his grave. In 1680 his son Sir Philip Perceval had been planning to erect a monument to his father within St. Audoen's Church, shortly before his own death. Family He married Catherine the only daughter of Robert Southwell of Kinsale, and of Helena Gore on 14 February 1655. They had six children: # Sir Philip, born 12 January 1656 in Kinsale. Eldest son and heir. 2nd Baronet. Died 11 September 1680 in Burton. # Robert, born 8 February 1657 in Kinsale. Murdered 5 June 1677 by an unknown assailant on The Strand, London. # Sir John, born 22 August 1660 near Burton. 3rd Baronet. Died 23 April 1686 in Burton. # Charles, born 4 November 1661 in London. Died July 1662 in Kinsale. # Catherine, born 19 March 1662 in Dublin. Married (1) Sir William Moore, (2) Major John Montgomery, (3) Brig.-Gen. George Freak. # Helena, born 17 February 1665 in Kinsale after her father's death. Married Colonel Daniel Dering.

Between 1886 and 1888, three well-tank condensing locomotives with a wheel arrangement were placed in service by the Cape Copper Mining Company on its two-foot six inch gauge Namaqualand Railway between Port Nolloth and O'okiep in the Cape of Good Hope. They were the first condensing steam locomotives to enter service in South Africa. Namaqualand Railway The Namaqualand Railway was constructed between 1869 and 1876 by the Cape Copper Mining Company, restructured as the Cape Copper Company in 1888. The railway from Port Nolloth on the West Coast to the copper mines around O'okiep was initially exclusively mule-powered, but in 1871 two 0-6-0T locomotives named John King and Miner were acquired by the mining company on an experimental basis. Their use appears to have been restricted mainly to the coastal section of the railway. By July 1887 both of them were permanently out of service.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 9. The Kitson condensers Between 1886 and 1888, three well-tank condensing locomotives were acquired from Kitson and Company. They were named John Taylor, Juanita and Jackal respectively and, like the earlier locomotives, they were operated with tenders due to the scarcity of water along the line. The tenders for the first two locomotives seem to have been acquired separately. The condensing equipment was mounted overhead in a roof-like frame and consisted of copper coils which formed an atmospheric radiator. Condensed steam was fed back for re-use into the large water tank underneath the locomotive's copper boiler. To protect the motion and bearings as well as working parts of the valve gear above the running boards from wind- blown sand, the locomotive was equipped with sheet-metal casing above and below the running boards, with the centre part of the bottom encasement hinged to allow access to the motion. The builder's picture of the locomotive shows it without a cab and with only a spectacle plate for crew protection, but in photographs of the locomotives in service, they have cab roofs installed underneath the overhead condensing coils. The engine John Taylor The first condensing locomotive, no. 1, named John Taylor after a director of the Cape Copper Mining Company, was built in 1886 with Kitson works number T198. It was delivered in mid-1886 and commenced trial runs in July 1886 before entering service on the section from Port Nolloth to Abbevlaack in August 1886. The engine Juanita Engine no. 2, named Juanita, was also built in 1886 with Kitson works number T220, and was delivered in March 1887. When it entered service, the working range of the two condensing locomotives was extended to Anenous, a distance of from Port Nolloth, and possibly all the way to Steinkopf at . Gross train weights, excluding tenders, for the section to Anenous were 67 tons up and 155 tons down, with 34 trucks in a train. The engine Jackal Engine no. 3, named Jackal, built in 1888 with Kitson works number T234, was delivered in December of that year and entered service in January 1889. Unlike the other two, it was delivered with a tender. In May 1894, the engine Jackal took the record for the fastest run between O'okiep and Port Nolloth, hauling a one-coach special in just under four hours at an average speed of about . Service After the arrival of their successor tender locomotives beginning in 1890, it was possible to introduce a through steam-hauled service from the coast to O'okiep from 15 May 1893. The condensing locomotives were then relegated to lesser duties, mainly ballast, sand clearing and other work trains. They also served as standby power to cover breakdowns and overhauls of the new mainline locomotives. From December 1896, one of them was allocated to O'okiep for shunting and local work, including service as construction locomotive while the Nababeep branchline was being built, and then as branchline power after the line was opened in late 1898 or early 1899. The locomotives were rotated occasionally and all three had service spells as the O'okiep engine. By 1910 they were no longer used on the Nababeep line since the trains had become too heavy. As a result of the poor quality of water in the region and tough working conditions, the three locomotives suffered major problems with their fireboxes and tubes and replacements were required fairly frequently. As an example, the engine Juanita required a new boiler and firebox in 1895, just eight years after entering service. The condensing system was also never successful due to the high ambient temperatures in the region. They remained in service on lower section traffic on the mainline until at least 1899. At some stage between then and late 1906, after they had been replaced on mainline service, their condensing equipment was removed, they lost their tenders and they were equipped with more substantial cabs and extended coal bunkers. According to the Cape Copper Company annual report on the year ending 30 April 1916, all three locomotives were still in service at that time.

Her father was Jos√© L. Acevedo Quiroz, a writer and poet from Quito. Her mother was Obdulia Vega Andrade, from Cuenca. Carmen Acevedo Vega was born in Guayaquil on July 16, 1913. Her father, Jos√© L. Acevedo Quiroz, was a writer and poet from Quito. Her mother, Obdulia Vega Andrade, was born in Cuenca. She lived her first years in a farm owned by his father in Naranjal. Years later, her family moved to Guayaquil, where she completed her elementary studies at the Colegio la Inmaculada in Guayaquil. She later had to drop from high school due to social prejudices of the time. When she was six years old, Carmen Acevedo Vega was taken to \\"San Vicente\\" farmland, which belonged to her father. At that moment, nature had an impact on her and she got introduced to the peasant life. During this time, she acquired a peculiar habit: she would never cry. She developed this habit because her parents would tell her older siblings that men must not cry, if they do so, they would look like women. This comment made her wonder why only women had the right to cry. Therefore, she resolved to not cry over anything. She first approached literature, as well as recitation and singing, because of a teacher of hers from Guayaquil. She was considered a quiet, anxious, shy girl at school and home. She focused most of her attention and time to her studies. She was the best of her class in gymnastics and olympics and got the highest grades. The theater world highly drew her attention; she was amused by theatrical performances, longing to be chosen for literary evenings. At home, she and her brother would imitate performers of the Comedian Children's Company that would showcase themselves at the Teatro Col√≥n. After she finished elementary school, she completed only two years of high school. Her father did not allow her to go to Vicente Rocafuerte School. Carmen had to stay at home, where she spent most of her time reading books. She then developed an interest in biographies, novels and classic literature. Her father helped motivate her to write her first poems, which would often talk about death and disappointment. She was also inspired by her father's friends, writers and musicians who would frequently visit their house. In 1929, she published a few poems in the Guayaquil magazines \\"Ideal‚Äù and \\"Per√∫\\". When Telmo Vaca del Pozo heard of her writings, he went to Carmen and advised her that being a poet would be very hard, especially because she was a woman, she would face strong criticism. After listening to this, she decided to not publish any more of her poems, and instead dedicated herself to singing. Her father supported her and encouraged her to study music. Carlos Alberto Gonz√°lez and Francisco Paredes Herrera became her private teachers. Her father also wanted Carmen to become an actress, but her mother strongly opposed the thought. Carmen would only sing at family evenings; and it was around this time that she learned to sew and embroider. She entered the Music Conservatory under the order of Maestro Pedro Pablo Traversari, and managed to study up to a second year of piano, reciting, and singing. In 1935 she became part of a writing team for the newspaper ‚ÄúEl Universo‚Äù. She resigned in 1938 in order to move to Cuenca where she worked for the newspaper ‚ÄúEl Mercurio‚Äù instead. A year later she returned to Guayaquil, while continuing her work for the local newspaper in Cuenca. In 1945, she married Vicente Idrovo Valdivieso, whom she divorced in 1953. They had a son named Luis Galo Idrovo Acevedo. The experiences she had in her youth are evoked in her verses . She is known for composing works on social themes and protest, through sensitive, rhythmic and lyrical verses. She died in Guayaquil on April 28, 2006. Memberships Carmen Acevedo Vega was a member of many Ecuadorian institutions, including: * Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana: Autonomous institution of cultural management in the Republic of Ecuador. It works since 1944 and has its main headquarters in the city of Quito. * Association of Journalists of Guayas * Association of Journalists of Guayaquil * National Confederation of Journalists of Ecuador: created in September 1975, is an entity of private law, with legal status, and its headquarters is rotating.

Developed in response to the longest and deepest economic recession post World War II, the primary objective of the stimulus package was to provide the economy with a boost. The bill‚Äôs rationale was based on Keynesian Economic Theory, providing tax reductions and increasing jobs to boost private spending, preventing the economy from any further slowdown. The approximate cost of the bill was estimated to be $20.1 billion spread across 1977 and 1978 , where the Act helped to create 9.3 million jobs, the largest increase in job creation for any presidency. The Act was a contributing factor to Stagflation, which was apparent when Carter took over the office but worsened towards the end of his term. The politics around the stimulus made the Act highly controversial. The Republicans felt that the Act was overcompensating, while on the left, many Democrats felt that the was not doing enough and was not big enough. Economist Milton Friedman argued that the tax cut would have little effect on consumption and GDP.  Initial Bill  President Carter announced that unemployment would be his primary concerns when he entered office on 20 January 1977. The Economic Stimulus Appropriation Act was initially introduced as a $31.1 billion fiscal stimulus package. The package was drafted by Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal; Charles L. Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and Budget Director Bert Lance. The bill was immediately met with mixed responses, with many suggesting that it was a ‚ÄúMinimax solution.‚Äù The initial bill had two components; the first part included a tax cut for both households and businesses, accompanied by a simple tax rebate of $50 which would be given to all citizens. The goal of this component would be to provide a boost for the slowing economy. The second part was an extensive job program, that would help with job creation to tackle the growing unemployment.  Legislative History  A week after President Carter took office, aides of Carter began to appear in front of committees of Congress, explaining the contents of the stimulus package. The components of the Act were developed during the transitional period before Carter was inaugurated.  House of Representative Assembly  The House version of the bill was introduced on 10 March 1977. It was sponsored by Democrat George H. Mahon, the chairman of the United States House Committee on Appropriations. On 4 May 1977, the House passed the bill by a 281 - 126 vote.  Senate  The Senate version of the bill was introduced on 17 March 1977; this version of the bill was heavily criticized as it saw the removal of the $50 tax rebate and the tax cut for businesses. Charles L. Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, justified the removal claiming that the economy appeared to be more stimulated than anticipated and the provisions were redundant. Although both parties were unhappy with the original provisions, Carter faced further criticism after announcing that the $50 tax rebate and business tax credits would be removed from the bill. This time the criticism came from both the Democrats and Republicans from the Senate Budget Committee. The Democratic Sen, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Edmund S. Muski and Republic Sen. Henry S. Bellmon condemned the sudden removal. Sen. Bellmon said by withdrawing the cornerstone of his stimulus package; the President has left the budget process ‚Äúwith egg on its face.‚Äù In response to these statements, Michael Blumenthal defended the removal by stating that there was a growing belief within the team that leaving the rebate it would be misguided. The initial bill also included a $50 per person tax rebate, which Carter proposed during his campaign, claiming that it would better help stimulate the economy. A temporary business tax cut was also included, providing small businesses with an opportunity to reduce their payroll. These provisions were introduced to help improve demand and boost the economy. However, they were faced with heavy criticism when introduced to the House committee, arguing the impact of the rebate and considerations for more favourable alternatives such as a permanent tax cut. The provision's removal was faced with heavy criticism from both sides of the party, as Congress had to amend its 1977 budget process in order to integrate the bill. The withdrawal was deemed by many as ‚Äúa body blow to the Congressional budget process‚Äù. Despite the discontent, Senate voted, 63 - 15 to end the debate on the bill and advanced it on 2 May 1977.  Conference Report  The congressional negotiators reported that the Conference Report was completed on 3 May 1977. The House Majority Leader Robert Byrd scheduled a vote on the bill the next day. On 4 May, the House agreed to the Conference Report, 326 - 87. The reported was passed by the majority except for 17 Democrats voted for the bill, and 70 Republicans voted against it (19 congress members did not vote). The Senate passed the Conference Report on 5 May 1977.  Presidential Signing  Jimmy Carter signing the Economic Appropriations Act. On 13 May 1977, President Carter hosted 25 mayors from the country‚Äôs most financially struggling cities to watch him sign the $20.1 billion bill into law. The signing ceremony was held at the White House Rose Garden.  Provisions of the Act  The following are the main features of the bill:  Public Service Employment  * $7.9 billion: Public Service Jobs would be expanded from 310,000 to 725,000 jobs. * Youth Employment Programs to create over 200,000 jobs for young people.  Tax Reduction  * $5 billion: Increase in the standard deduction, primarily targeted at moderate and low- income workers.  Public Works Projects  * $4 billion  Regular Revenue-sharing program  * $4.99 billion  Job Creation Program  330x330pxUnder the stimulus package, it provided further support and funding for the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), which was aimed to provide training for workers and jobs in the public sector. The added funds helped to expand the role and capacity of the Job Corps, a program operated by the Depart of Labor that provided education and vocational training to youths between the age of 16 to 24. The bill assisted the program to open new residential centres and increased its capacity from 22,000 to 30,000. Additionally, there was also an increase in funding for the program, providing it with $274 million. Additional funding was also given to programs to help train unskilled workers such as the Skill Training Improvement Program (STIP), a program that provides training to low-income and unskilled workers, especially to those located in rural regions and Native Americans. A few programs were created as part of the stimulus to help boost the employment rate. The Veterans HIRE (Help through Industry Retraining and Employment) program was formed to train and hire veterans. Focusing on decrease the unemployment rate among veterans, with the program prioritizing those that are disabled or were involved in the Vietnam War. Under Carter‚Äôs administration, the government formed the largest public service job program, adding a total of 9.8 million jobs during his presidency. A 10.9% increase in employment during his four-year tenure.  Recommendations by Economists  Initially, when the bill was first introduced, Arthur F. Burns, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, was critical of President Carter‚Äôs economic program. Burns targeted the $50 tax rebate, stating that the reserve does not have enough money and would not be the most effective method in stimulating the economy. In turn, he suggested that the government reduce levies in corporate tax, and public employment should only be established as a last resort. The New York Times commented on President Carter for attempting to please all sides. In a news analysis piece, they wrote, ‚ÄúHe was in truth the very model of an agreeable man.‚Äù This statement was to criticize Carter of only surrounding himself with people who agreed with him and at the same time, agreed with all the advice that he received from others. Professor Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago favoured permanent income tax cuts as compared to job creation through federal spending. He suggested a permanent tax cut followed by a maximum tax of 25 percent off an individual‚Äôs income and elimination of double taxation of corporate profits. Friedman claimed that it would help to eliminate the ‚Äúreal tax burden‚Äù or government expenditures that the stimulus package would have inflationary effects on the economy and will fail to improve employment.  Congressional Budget Office Reports  Congressional Budget Office's economic projection with the rebate removed. For the first draft of the bill, the CBO estimated that the impact of President Carter‚Äôs economic stimulus would contribute an additional $14 billion to the gross national product (GNP) in the first year. In the second year, it would contribute another $18 billion to the country‚Äôs GNP. When comparing the economy without stimulus in place, the bill would help to add an estimated 1 percent to GNP in its 1977 and 1.3 percent by 1978. The CBO also projected a decrease in unemployment by a decrease in 0.5 percent in 1977 and 0.7 percent in 1978. When the CBO did a revised forecast to account for the removal of the rebate, the CBO estimated an increase of unemployment rate of 0.2 percent. The increase in unemployment would result in a loss of 280,000 jobs in 1977, while the forecast for unemployment for 1978 remains unchanged. The CBO also forecasted that the government would see a $15.8 billion reduction in tax revenue, with $7.8 billion extending from temporary laws and an additional $7.9 billion that would arise from the stimulus package. Overall, with the added stimulus measures, the Carter administration would see a fiscal budget deficit of $61.8 billion. The actual budget deficit was less than the projected budget of $53 that was announced in 1978.  Developments under the Act and estimates of the Act's effects  New York Stock Exchange Carter‚Äôs advisors initially felt that a two-year economic stimulus program would better help to restore the economy. The original Act was priced between $25 billion to $32 billion, claiming that a more comprehensive stimulus plan spread over two years would be more suitable for the economic situation at the time. However, as Carter‚Äôs aides further examined the situation, a conclusion was made that a one-year program would be more palatable, both economically and in Congress. Schultze presented in front of a congress committee, stating that with the stimulus in place, the country‚Äôs real GNP would be from 5% to 6% between the fourth quarter of 1976 to 1977. However, without the stimulus, the growth rate would be at a lower 4.5% to 4.75%. He also alluded to the potential of an additional stimulus if growth was not up to projection. At the State of the Union address in 1981, President Carter announced that the bill had generated 425,000 public service jobs, and the youth employment initiative has helped fund over 200,000 jobs. Additionally, the slots at Job Corps were increased to 44,000 by a total of 100%, and a million summer youth jobs were approved. However, an analysis done by survey firms in 1978 stated that the impact of jobs credits was limited, with many firms were unaware of the existence of such programs. While more than 2.0 million people participated in CETA programs which helped to reduce the unemployment rate, disparities were still present across genders, races and locations. A study revealed that while the unemployment rates among whites declined from 7.8 to 6.4 percent, unemployment among African Americans failed to show any reduction. A further study done by senior Carter Administration Treasury Official Emil Sunley and economist Ned Gramlich stated that the bill had little effect. The bill resulted in heavy inflation that led to the eventual recession in 1980. The period was later known as the time of Stagflation, where both inflation and recession occurred at the same time. The administration‚Äôs focus on full employment led to the country‚Äôs eventual problem of inflation. Carter‚Äôs aides were aware of the inflation problem when they entered office in 1977, but they thought they were able to control it. Carter‚Äôs aggressive fiscal and monetary policies called for an increase of money supply by the Federal Reserve. This led to a spike in inflation, climbing to 13.3 percent in two years. Even though there was a rise in inflation, unemployment failed to decrease, resulting in a period of high prices and unemployment. It took Paul Volcker, the 12th Federal Reserve Chairman, to bring inflation back down with the ‚ÄúVolcker Shock‚Äù. The strategy implemented, led to the raised interest rates and limiting the country‚Äôs liquidity to bring down inflation.

Bontecou served as an attorney and investigator for both the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. War Department. She also worked as a professor at two universities. During her career, Bontecou achieved national fame for her work in the civil liberties and women's rights movements. Early life and education Bontecou was born in Short Hills, New Jersey, a community in Millburn Township, New Jersey. She graduated from the Beard School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Orange, New Jersey. Bontecou then completed her bachelor's degree at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 1913. During her time at Bryn Mawr, she earned the Brooke Hall Memorial Scholarship and the Bryn Mawr European Scholarship. After Bonctecou earned her law degree from New York University in 1917, she continued to study law under Felix Frankfurter at Harvard University. Civil rights and war crimes investigations In 1943, Bontecou joined the Civil Rights Section in the Criminal Division at the U.S. Department of Justice. She served as one of the first seven attorneys at the agency, the precursor to the Civil Rights Division. Bontecou conducted a comprehensive study of how the U.S. and its allies treated conscientious objectors during World War I. She would later put forward recommendations for better treatment of conscientious objectors in World War II. In 1946, Bontecou transferred to the War Department (now the Department of Defense). She assisted preparation for the prosecution of major war criminals from the Pacific Theatre of World War II. During 1947, Bontecou visited Nuremberg to investigate and report on war crimes in Germany. During her retirement, she helped victims of unfounded accusations made during the McCarthy era. Advocacy to end poll taxes Bontecou gave legal advice to the Southern Conference for Human Welfare to assist its campaign to end poll taxes for black American voters. She also collaborated with political scientist Ralph Bunche on a survey of southern suffrage for the New School for Social Research (now the New School) and the Carnegie Foundation. The study found an association between low wages paid to black Americans and their difficulty paying poll taxes. This hardship factored into decreased participation in voting. In 1941, Bontecou testified before a Congressional hearing on poll taxes held by a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. She described the long-term study on the effect of poll taxes on voting participation. Career in academia In 1922, Bontecou returned to Bryn Mawr as its Acting Dean. She received her Ph.D. from the Brookings Graduate School of Economics and Government (now the Brookings Institution) in 1928. Bonctecou then briefly worked as a professor in the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago until contracting encephalitis lethargica. The long-term illness led her to spend most of the 1930s bedridden. Although Bonctecou eventually attained better health, she experienced lingering lifelong effects, including a tremor in her hands and hampered balance.Virginia Women in History 2011 Honors and legacy A law professorship at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey carries Bontecou's name. In 2011, the Library of Virginia honored her as one of its Virginia Women in History. The Harry S. Truman Library and Museum houses Bontecou's papers.

He discovered gold in Charters Towers. He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. Early life Mosman was born on 11 February 1843 in Mosman, New South Wales. Merchant Archibald Mosman (1799‚Äì1863) was his father, and his mother was Harriet n√©e Farquharson Hugh received his education at The King's School in North Parramatta, New South Wales. Mosman initially aspired to be a pastoralist, but failed to establish a successful career and was left broke., He visited Queensland in 1860, hoping to acquire properties there; this was also unsuccessful. Mosman decided then to try his hand at prospecting. He spent the next ten years mining, and in 1870 he revisited Queensland, choosing to work in Ravenswood. Gold On 24 December 1871, Mosman was travelling with miners George Clark, James Fraser, and his servant, Jupiter Mosman, attempting to locate missing horses., After he found them, Jupiter located some shining gold nestled in a creek. Mosman named the place where the gold had been located Charters Towers (Charters Tors) after the gold mining warden W. S. E. M. Charters. After Jupiter's discovery was reported in January 1872, Ravenswood's population blossomed to around 30,000 people. The discovery prompted a gold rush in north of Queensland. Mosman's life was largely simple from that point forward. In 1882, Mosman's left forearm was blown off by dynamite, which had exploded earlier than it was supposed to. Mosman remained generally reclusive up until June 1891, when he became a member of the Queensland Legislative Council. He did not give many speeches, and they were noted as being \\"conservative and unremarkable\\". He resigned in January 1905. Later life In retirement, Mosman pursued his interest in horse racing, owning a number of horses. His horse Balfour won the Queensland Turf Club Derby in 1902. In the final months of his life, he was not in good health. However, on Saturday 13 November 1909, Mosman went to Eagle Farm Racecourse for the Derby race, but was forced to return home after the first race feeling ill. On the following Monday 15 November, he was at his residence Easton Gray, Soudan Street, Toowong, Brisbane, when he drank a glass of milk and died. He was buried in Toowong Cemetery on 16 November 1909. He never married but was well-connected through his sisters Harriette (second wife of Queensland Premier Thomas McIlwraith) and Cecilia (wife of Queensland Premier Arthur Hunter Palmer). He and left over ¬£70,000 to his relatives, much of it to his nephew Cecil Palmer. Legacy A street in Charters Towers was named after him. The Mossman River was named by the explorer George Dalrymple on 6 December 1873. Dalrymple wrote \\"I named this river the Mossman River, after Mossman, an explorer and mining man, member of a very prominent mining family\\". The town of Mossman takes its name from the river. The house Easton Gray (home of the Palmer family) and its 18 acres of land was sold in 1944 to construct Toowong High School, now Queensland Academy for Science, Mathematics and Technology.

It was built for the Mughal statesman Mirza Abul Hassan Jah, who was titled Asif Khan. Asif Khan was brother of Nur Jahan, and brother-in-law to the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. Asif Khan's tomb is located adjacent to the Tomb of Jahangir, and near the Tomb of Nur Jahan. Asif Khan's tomb was built in a Central Asian architectural style, and stands in the centre of a Persian-style Charbagh garden.  Background  Historical photograph of the tomb, taken in 1880 Asif Khan was the brother of Empress Nur Jahan, and father of Arjumand Bano Begum, who became the consort of Shah Jahan under the name Mumtaz Mahal. In 1636, he was elevated as Khan-e-Khana and commander-in-chief and a year later became the governor of Lahore. Asif Khan died on 12 June 1641 in a battle against the forces of rebel Raja Jagat Singh. His tomb was commissioned to be built in the Shahdara Bagh tomb complex in Lahore by Shah Jahan. History Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the shrine following Khan's death in 1641. According to Abdul Hamid Lahori, author of the Padshahnama, the shrine was under construction for 4 years until 1645 at a cost of 300,000 rupees. The tomb was built directly west of the Tomb of Jahangir, and forms an axis with Jahangir's tomb that is interrupted by the Akbari Sarai. The tomb was heavily damaged during the rule of the Sikh Empire. Lahore's first Sikh rules, Gujjar Singh, Lahna Singh, and Subha Singh, are noted to have damaged the tomb, and planted large pipal trees next to the shrine that obstructed views of it. The trees were removed only in the British era. The tomb was also plundered by the Sikhs in the 19th century for its marble and sandstone. Ranjit Singh was noted by British explorer William Moorcroft to have removed marble from the tomb's interior, exterior, as well as the various stones that were used to decorate the tomb. The plundered materials were then used to decorate the Golden Temple in Amritsar, as well as for use to build the Hazuri Bagh Baradari near the Lahore Fort. The marble cenotaph of Asif Khan Some of the elaborate surviving tile work Layout The tomb is built entirely of brick in an octagonal plan, and sits in the centre of a large quadrangle measure 300 yards on each side. The tomb is set upon a chabutra, or podium, that elevates the structe 3 feet 9 inches relative to the garden. Each side of the octagon measures 38 feet 8 inches, Large gates exist in both northern and southern walls, though the tomb's main gate is the southern one. A small mosque is found in the eastern wall that was converted into a residence during the British period, while the western wall offers access to the Tomb of Jahangir via the Akbari Sarai. Octagonal tombs were never used for emperors, but were commonly employed for burial of high-ranking noblemen such as Asif Khan. The floor of the platform on which the tomb stands was built with Sang-e Abri, or red limestone, while the outer walls were covered with red sandstone.  Architecture  Exterior Some of the shrine's tile work still survives At the time of its construction, the tomb was noted to feature some of the finest examples of building arts and crafts. The exterior originally was adorned with marble stone inlay work and veneered with stucco tracery, and blue kashi tiles typical of Lahore. The floors were decorated with marble, inlaid with precious stones. Each side of the tomb has a deeply recessed iwan, or alcove, with a door and arched window looking into the tomb. Interior Some plasterwork still survives on the dome's underside The tomb's interior features 8 portals that offer access to the interior from the outside. The interior was renowned for its lavish use of white marble and precious stone inlay, which has since disappeared. The inner dome ceiling is decorated in a high plaster relief of interlacing patterns, some of which still survives. The floor was once paved with red sandstone, though this was removed during the Sikh period. The tomb contains a cenotaph made of pure marble, carved with inscriptions from the Qur'an, similar to that in Emperor Jahangir's adjacent tomb. Dome A large central double-layered brick bulbous dome rests atop the octagonal base. The bulbous dome that crowns the tomb was once covered in a marble veneer, and is of a shape that is unique among all Mughal structures. Such bulbous domes were an innovation of Shah Jahan's era, and were used to great effect at other sites such as the Taj Mahal in Agra. Garden The tomb features a long pool in each of the 4 cardinal directions. The tomb once had a water reservoir, which fed into fountains and pathways. The tomb is surrounded by a Persian-style Charbagh garden, with four long pools, or hauz, lined with walkways in each of the 4 cardinal directions. Southern gate The southern gate serves as the primary entrance in the tomb's garden complex. It is a double storied building built of brick that is roughly square in shape. The southern fa√ßade of the gateway was covered with red sandstone and white marble, while the other three sides featured decorated plasterwork. The gate's interior features four small chambers, two of which are accessible by staircases. The central portion of the gateway features a two story tall iwan portal that was finished with stucco work, with four smaller iwans flanking the central portal, divided into two levels. The flooring of the gateway features brickwork laid in a geometric design. Jawab gate The jawab gate is embellished with tile-work The northern edge of the complex's boundary walls features another large gateway. The gate is named the jawab, or \\"response\\", gate as a reference to the southern gate. It is also a two storied structure, with a central arched iwan portal flanked by four smaller portals. The fa√ßade of the gate was covered in intricate tile work, known as kashi kari, some of which still survives. Conservation The tomb did not attract much attention from British colonial authorities, although a staircase in the shrine that had been destroyed by the Sikhs was rebuilt in 1905, while the floor's brick work and the ceiling's plasterwork were repaired. The shrine was protected by law for the first time in 1912 by British authorities. The gardens and its causeways were repaired by the British in 1920‚Äì21. The garden was further restored in 1924‚Äì25 and 1930‚Äì34. Following independence, the tomb came under the management of Pakistan's Department of Archaeology. The southern walls at the tomb were swept away by flooding of the River Ravi in 1955, while further flood damage occurred in 1973. The tomb's southern walls were repaired in 1986‚Äì87. Today the tomb and the walls as well as the main gate are dilapidated. Though Pakistani law forbids construction of new buildings within 150 feet of heritage sites, the tomb's boundary walls are separated from private homes by a narrow street on its western and northern sides. Immediately north of the tomb is the shrine of Nim Pir, dating from the Mughal era. Conservation work at the tomb resumed in 2005 with assistance from the Global Heritage Fund. The tomb, along with the adjacent Akbari Sarai and the Tomb of Jahangir, is on the tentative list as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

After Albert's death in 1928, his nephew Albert L. Alford returned to Lewiston from Washington and Lee University in Virginia to assume the position as a managing editor, then became the publisher and editor after his father's death in 1946. Known to his friends as \\"Bud\\" Alford, he continued to work for the Tribune for 43 years. Following his death in 1968, son Albert Larson \\"Butch\\" Alford, became the third publisher of the Tribune. Following 89 years of local ownership, two-thirds of the stock was sold in 1981 to TCI Newspapers of Denver. Butch Alford repurchased the Tribune from TCI in late 1997.  Community participation and recognition  The Lewiston Morning Tribute partners with Inland 360 to publish articles about local businesses and events that are voted as the best by members in the community. The Lewiston Morning Tribune also has a recognition article that allows people in the valley to vote once a week on a local athlete to become their \\"prep athlete of the week\\". The athlete who wins receives an article recognizing them in the sports section of the paper.

The CID broadly represents scholars in the discipline of Communication, but has a specific mandate to directly serve those who are members of any member associations of CCA. Since 2016, these have included: * American Journalism Historians Association * Association for Business Communication * Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication * Association of Schools of Journalism and Mass Communication * Black College Communication Association * Broadcast Education Association * International Communication Association * National Association for Media Literacy Education When CID was founded in 2010, one other association was a member: * National Communication Association  History  The CID was created as a direct result of the National Communication Association's Summer Conference on Intercultural Dialogue, held in Istanbul, Turkey, July 22‚Äì26, 2009. Wendy Leeds-Hurwitz, in her role as Chair of the International and Intercultural Communication Division of NCA, served as conference organizer, and Nazan Haydari, based at Maltepe University in Istanbul, served as local arrangements coordinator. Other members of the organizing committee were Donal Carbaugh (US), Tamar Katriel (Israel), Kristine Fitch Mu√±oz (US), Yves Winkin (France), and Saskia Witteborn (Hong Kong). Support for the conference was provided by both NCA and Maltepe University. Patrice Buzzanell (2011) describes one of the plenary presentations in some detail, and Leeds-Hurwitz (2015) provides a detailed description of the unusual conference designLeeds-Hurwitz, W. (2015). Facilitating intercultural dialogue through innovative conference design. In N. Haydari & P. Holmes (Eds.), Case studies in intercultural dialogue (pp. 3-22). Dubuque, IA: Kendall-Hunt. The Summer Conference resulted in a preconference at the International Communication Association convention in Singapore in 2010, organized by Evelyn Ho. The first publication resulting from the presentations appeared in 2011, in a special issue of the Journal of International and Intercultural Communication, edited by Prue Holmes and Shiv Ganesh. An edited collection resulting from the Istanbul conference appeared in 2015, edited by Haydari and Holmes.Haydari, N., & Holmes, P. (Eds.). (2015). Case studies in intercultural dialogue. Dubuque, IA: Kendall-Hunt. Broome & Collier (2012) praise the increased attention paid by intercultural scholars to intercultural dialogue as a specific focus, using the CID as evidence for this attention. Participants at the Summer Conference wanted a way to encourage further international connections for intercultural research, and so a proposal was brought before the Council of Communication Associations' Board of Directors at their March 2010 meeting to create the Center for Intercultural Dialogue, which was approved. Wendy Leeds-Hurwitz was appointed Director of CID at that same meeting. The first Advisory Board was approved at the September 2010 meeting, and included: Donal Carbaugh, William Evans, Nazan Haydari, Barbara Hines, Janice Hume, Leena Louhiala-Salminen, Charles Self, Michael Slater, Katerina St√©nou and Valerie White. New members of the Board were appointed in 2014, and again in 2017. Together Board members represent all of the CCA member associations (through overlapping memberships), as well as the applied context of international non-profits. The CID website now serves as a clearinghouse for information on intercultural dialogue topics, and facilitates connections between international scholars by sharing information on publication opportunities, international conferences and positions, graduate school programs, and researcher profiles.Leeds- Hurwitz, W.

Several other organizations have either the same or a similar name. The CID described in this entry is the only one designed to serve the Communication discipline specifically, and to facilitate the study of intercultural dialogue as a research topic by creating an international network of scholars. It is for this reason that the CID's slogan is \\"Bridging Cultures Through Research.\\" Publications CID began publishing Key Concepts in Intercultural Dialogue, a set of one page descriptions of technical vocabulary related to intercultural dialogue in various ways, in February 2014.https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/publications/key-concepts-in- intercultural-dialogue-by-concept/ The first few terms were: intercultural dialogue, cosmopolitanism, intercultural competence, coordinated management of meaning, intercultural communication, intercultural capital, and intergroup relations dialogue, with 94 published by the end of 2019. As of November 2014, terms in languages other than English were added, including yuan (Chinese), conscientiza√ß√£o (Portuguese), uchi-soto (Japanese), testimonio (Spanish), and interkulturelle Philosophie (German), among others.

The novel was published by Melville House International in 2013; it is a sequel to Mukoma‚Äôs first novel, Nairobi Heat. Black Star Nairobi focuses on two detectives who investigate a hotel bombing and a murder that are linked. The novel‚Äôs backdrop is the 2007 presidential elections in Kenya, which ended in violence. Synopsis Ishmael, an African American detective originally from Madison, Wisconsin, relocates to Kenya and starts a detective agency called the Black Star Agency with his associate, O (short for Odhiambo). Ishmael and O‚Äôs initial investigations involve odd cases, such as recovering ‚Äústolen‚Äù male gonads and cases of witchcraft; the only reason that the detectives are willing to take on these cases is that they are desperate for cash. They suddenly jump at the opportunity to investigate a new case involving a man who has been murdered and discarded in the Ngong Forest. They eventually realize that the man‚Äôs murder might be linked to a later bombing of the Norfolk Hotel in downtown Nairobi, which leaves ten Americans dead. Over the course of the novel, Ishmael and O‚Äôs case becomes more complicated when the results of the presidential election prompt tribal violence. Forces working against the two detectives try to keep them from investigating the case. The constant tug-of- war leads the detectives around the world, from Nairobi to Oakland, California to Mexico and back to Nairobi again. Themes in the novel Violence The novel takes place in 2007, when Kenya‚Äôs troubled presidential election resulted in ethnic violence between Kikuyus and Luos. Although the bombing of the hotel in the novel is fictitious, it is based on real acts of violence committed by ethnic gangs, such as the slaughtering of large groups of people with machetes and the burnings of Christian churches. On the post-election violence, Mukoma responded, \\"In this novel I'm driven by the question of violence. In the post-electoral violence of 2007 it was a sort of intimate violence where it was neighbor-against-neighbor ‚Äî people who knew each other. And there are a lot of questions that arose ... questions of class, the question of the whole democratic process. So I wanted to have characters, you know, who are running around trying to do their case, you know, but all the while being drawn back, you know, by the power, by the powerful nature of the violence that broke out.\\" Invisibility Another prominent theme in the novel is that of invisibility. Worlds that Ishmael never knew existed are revealed in the novel, such as the Tavern where police officers, professional criminals and prostitutes form working relationships and provide each other tips on how to solve crimes. Ishmael also deals extensively with his feelings of invisibility‚Äîin the United States, he is seen as merely a black man, but in Kenya, his invisibility is replaced with high (and awkward) visibility. His visibility as an American also proves to be dangerous for him, as he keeps guarded against criminals who try to commit crimes against foreigners.

She discovered her talent in Canada, where she had moved in 1970. Over the span of four short years before her death at the age of 46, she managed to write and illustrate eight picture books, three of them published posthumously. Biography Born Marcia Schonfeld in Queens, New York, young Dayal Kaur spent her days with her Grandma Shapiro while both her parents worked. Her childhood with her grandmother formed the basis of her works, especially Tales of a Gambling Grandma. Grandma Shapiro's death in 1951 when Dayal Kaur was nine was devastating to her. Dayal Kaur graduated from the City College of New York in 1963 and attended The Arts Students League from 1964 to 1965. Though she still lived at home, Dayal Kaur had a loft space in Lower Manhattan and associated with mutually influential avant-garde artists, teachers and students, including Roy Lichtenstein and his friends. In 1966, her mother became ill with breast cancer. She died the following year leaving Dayal Kaur with an apprehension of the agony she might experience if she were to become ill. Around the time of her mother's illness, Dayal Kaur Khalsa was active in the civil rights movement in New York and in the American South. Afterwards, she toured Mexico with her father, brother and his wife, then stayed in San Miguel Allende for a time with fellow artist Brian Grison. In 1970, Dayal Kaur moved to Canada with Grison and stayed on when their relationship ended, supporting herself in desultory work that included cleaning other people's houses. In 1974, she moved to a farm near Millbrook, Ontario with her artist friend, Yvonne Lammerich. That farm provided the setting for her book Julian. In 1975, Dayal Kaur left the farm and joined a women's health collective in Toronto. When all the other members of the collective moved into the 3HO Kundalini Yoga Ashram, she moved along with them. In time, she adopted the Sikh lifestyle and asked for and received her new name from Yogi Bhajan, meaning \\"princess of kindness and purity.\\" While living in the Ashram, Dayal Kaur became responsible for designing the 3HO's various promotional materials. This led to her business involvement in the late 1970s with the graphic design studio \\"Intermedia Associates\\" and other small business ventures with local artist/entrepreneur Brian Irving. It was during this period Dayal received a series of parcels from New York City containing items from her former life as, \\"Marcia\\". In an abandoned art portfolio Brian discovered several vibrant drawings and story ideas (which Dayal later incorporated into her books). Despite his enthusiasm for these echos of her former life as an artist and writer, it was Dayal's belief that these former personal interests might be at odds with her commitment to a spartan spiritual lifestyle at the Ashram. In the early 1980s, she moved to the 3HO live-in yoga centre in Montreal. Although she published a short story in the Carolina Quarterly[Carolina Quarterly https://web.archive.org/web/20111019064040/http://cqonline.web.unc.edu/about- us/] in 1972 (as Marcia Schonfeld), her first entry into the publishing world as Dayal Kaur Khalsa took place when she was introduced to May Cutler, publisher and president of Tundra Books. In Cutler's word's: \\"I met her in 1982 when she brought illustrations to show us. They did not impress for idea, content, or technical proficiency, but they had one quality that is less common than you would think: strong colour sense. She could mix garish colours together - rather like the Berber women of Morocco -- and come up with a vibrant and united whole.\\" Dayal Kaur's first project with Tundra was twelve object recognition board books for infants done in her typically vibrant colours. Her first book for older children, Tales of a Gambling Grandma, was a runaway success, winning her a lucrative American contract and a number of awards. But before the accolades began to pour in, Dayal Kaur was beset by her father's suicide and her own diagnosis of breast cancer. She toiled tirelessly and seven more books followed in close succession. Her Canadian publisher remarked: \\"She was extremely generous with her art. Her books have as many as twenty-five paintings ‚Äì in contrast to half that many in many children's books ‚Äì plus endleaves that are as caringly crafted as the interiors. I asked her once where she got the energy and time to develop the stories and do fifty or sixty illustrations a year. (That was between operations, hospital visits, chemotherapy, and all the accompanying discomfort.) She grinned: \\"It's easy, May. I've got a deadline.\\" Works *In the Eyes of the Women, a short story she published as Marcia Schonfeld (Carolina Quarterly, Winter 1972, pp. 15-22) *The Baabee Books, Series I and II (Tundra, 1983) *The Baabee Books, Series III (Tundra, 1984) *Tales of a Gambling Grandma (Clarkson N.

According to The New York Times, Fonzi was recruited as an investigator for the HSCA \\"mainly on the strength of scathing magazine critiques he had written about the Warren Commission and its conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone in killing the president in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\\" Gerald Posner wrote: \\"Fonzi seems an unusual choice for an inquiry that claimed to be impartial, as he was a committed believer in a conspiracy, having written his first article critical of the Warren Commission in 1966.\\" At the HSCA he focused on the role of Cuban exile groups and the links of these groups with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Mafia. Fonzi obtained testimony from Antonio Veciana that Veciana had once seen his CIA contact, who Fonzi established was David Atlee Phillips, conferring with Lee Harvey Oswald. In the course of these investigations Fonzi attempted to contact Oswald's friend George de Mohrenschildt on March 31, 1977; hours later, de Mohrenschildt was dead, an apparent suicide.AP, Aiken Standard, March 31, 1977, Man Who Knew Oswald Apparently Takes Own Life Fonzi published a 1980 The Washingtonian article on the subject which aroused enough interest from the CIA for it to investigate whether Fonzi had breached his 1978 non-disclosure agreement with the CIA, which he had signed in order to gain access to classified files (it concluded that Fonzi had not).CIA, \\"Memorandum for: Article by Gaeton Fonzi: 'Who Killed JFK'? in the November 1980 Issue of The Washingtonian\\", undated, NARA Record Number: 104-10404-10063 The article later formed the basis for his 1993 book, The Last Investigation.

His multi-faceted ≈ìuvre can be seen as an extension of a constructivist language ‚Äì which remained central throughout his career ‚Äì to a wide range of media from video, performance, and installation to painting, sculpture, and graphics, as well as various thematic focuses from the deconstruction of mass media to institutional critique.  Biography   Early life  Hal√°sz, one of two children of a town official and a housewife, was born in Paks on 28 January 1946. Between 1961 and 1965, he was a student in the department of decorative painting at the P√©cs Arts Grammar School. He became familiar with and influenced by the international neo-avant-garde tendencies ‚Äì especially Op and Pop Art ‚Äì by attending the lectures of G√©za Perneczky, one of the most influential Hungarian art historians of the time.Perneczky, G√©za: \\"Introducing the World of K√°roly Hal√°sz.\\" In Pinczehelyi, S√°ndor (ed.): Hopp-Hal√°sz K√°roly. P√©cs: P√©csi Gal√©ria √©s Vizu√°lis M≈±v√©szeti M≈±hely, 2011, p. 28. After graduation, Hal√°sz started to work at the Bauxite Mine of P√©cs as a decorative artist, an experience that was influential in the formation of his own style and served as a common denominator among a group of young artists, gathered around artist and teacher Ferenc Lantos (1929 ‚Äì 2014).Csatl√≥s, Judit: \\"In the Sad Tropics. The Photo- and Video-Based Works of K√°roly Hal√°sz.\\" In Pinczehelyi, S√°ndor (ed.): Hopp- Hal√°sz K√°roly. P√©cs: P√©csi Gal√©ria √©s Vizu√°lis M≈±v√©szeti M≈±hely, 2011, p. 82.  Early Works and the foundation of the P√©cs Workshop (1968‚Äì1972)  The Studio of Applied Arts of P√©cs was formed by Lantos and a circle of committed former students of the P√©cs Arts Grammar School as a platform for collaborative experimentation and (self-)education. The neo-avant-garde artist group P√©cs Workshop (P√©csi M≈±hely) grew out from this studio, co-founded by Hal√°sz, K√°roly Kism√°nyoky (1943 ‚Äì 2018), S√°ndor Pinczehelyi (1946) Ferenc Ficzek (1947 ‚Äì 1987) and K√°lm√°n Szij√°rt√≥ (1946) in 1968 (formally in 1970).Doboviczki, T. Attila (ed.): Parallel Avant-garde: P√©cs Workshop 1968‚Äì1980. Budapest, Ludwig Museum, 2017. . In the early period of the group, neo-constructivist tendencies were dominant, inspired by summer workshops in the enamel factory of Bonyh√°d between 1969 and 1971, where they created geometric compositions with industrial enamel in collaboration with the factory workers.Perneczky, \\"Introducing the World of K√°roly Hal√°sz.\\", 29. Hal√°sz, under the influence of Bauhaus and Op art, also created numerous geometric paintings (e.g. Color Series, 1970) and enamel works (e.g. Radial Enamel (Red-Blue), 1969, Structures with Pipes, 1970) as well as sculptures (e.g. Cubes, 1972). In 1971, he found the motive of high stand, for him a sort of geometric equivalent of D√ºrer's magic square in Melencolia I, which led to the High Stand series, his largest geometric-conceptual body of work, that embodied in numerous montages, paintings, and sculptures (e.g. Sculpture I-III, 1978).For a selection of the series, see Pinczehelyi, S√°ndor (ed.): Hopp-Hal√°sz K√°roly.

Conceptual Works and Performances (1972‚Äì1982)  From 1971, the focus of the P√©cs Workshop, including Hal√°sz, shifted towards Conceptual, Pop and Land Art. Hal√°sz started a formative Europian tour in 1972, during which he attended the Documenta 5 at Kassel, a 100-day series of performances and events, directed by Harald Szeeman.Csatl√≥s, Judit: \\"In the Sad Tropics.

These works can be associated with the institutional critique of the documenta's section \\"artist's museums\\", with works by Marcel Broothaers, Herbert Dristel, Ben Vautier, and Marcel Duchamp, while they also mirrored the conditions of exhibiting progressive art in a socialist country, where modern and neo-avant-garde tendencies were officially rejected and therefore not represented by art institutions.Feh√©r, D√°vid: \\"Cry from a dark room. Remarks upon the Conceptual Works and Actions of K√°roly Hal√°sz.\\" In Pinczehelyi, S√°ndor (ed.) (2011). Hopp-Hal√°sz K√°roly. P√©cs: P√©csi Gal√©ria √©s Vizu√°lis M≈±v√©szeti M≈±hely. p. 65 Whatnot Museum (1972) consists of a shelving unit with jam jars, resembling a pantry, with reproductions from Kazimir Malevich's Black Square to Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty and Hal√°sz's own works. In the artist's words: \\"they are thoughts, far-off works, and one's own works out away for use in the future\\".Gyetvai, √Ågnes: Interj√∫ K√°roly Hal√°sz fest≈ëm≈±v√©sszel a Soros Arch√≠vum sz√°m√°ra (Interview with painter K√°roly Hal√°sz for the Soros Archive), 4 January 1989, ms, M≈±csarnok Library and Archive (B 85 06/a). This future usage of artworks is envisioned in The Museum of the Future (1977), a set of injection ampoules, with which, instead of visiting and contemplating, one can simply injects the experience of artworks from Lynda Benglis, Mario Merz, Marcel Broodthaers, Wolf Vostell, Lucas Samaras and others. This tongue-in-cheek vision resembles the words of the art historian √âva K√∂rner on Hungarian Conceptual art that \\"the impact of Western art came here as a serum, and everybody used it to satisfy their own burning needs.\\"Aknai, Katalin: \\"K√°roly Hal√°sz ‚Äì Photoworks 1971-79.\\" In Private Transmission. Photoworks 1971-79. Budapest, Vintage Gallery, 2010, 7. = Works with Television (Modulated Television, Private transmission, Pseudo- video) = Inspired by the writings and the works of L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, he started to experiment with photography and lightboxes, which led to the idea of TV object, a geometrical composition of two intersecting cuboids from steel, fixed on a television screen. This served as an arranging filter for television programs like the West Germany-Brazil soccer match in 1973, creating a hyperconstructed/deconstructed experience and chance-compositions, cached by the camera (e.g. Modulated Television II [1972], Modulated Television III [1973]). In Private Transmission (1974) he himself became the program, as he lived and slept in the empty shell of a TV for a day, while he created \\"Pseudo-videos\\" (1975) by replacing the TV screen with mirrors set at right angles to each other, which led to geometric self-portraits. Combining and extending Pseudo video and Private Transmission, Hal√°sz made a complex half-an-hour video action An Indian in Holland (1978) in Amsterdam Videoheads.Feh√©r, Ibid, 68. According to the documentation of LIMA, \\"'Indian‚Äô refers to \\"someone who lives far away from Western society, has no knowledge of technological and electronic developments, and therefore uses the medium more freely\\"K√°roly Hal√°sz: An Indian in Holland, 1978, LIMA collection: https://www.li-ma.nl/lima/catalogue/art/kroly-halsz/an-indian-in- holland/1200#. Accordingly, Hal√°sz experimented with unusual ways of using television, from painting over his face on the monitor with the help of a closed-circuit set-up to sitting cross-legged inside the empty TV cabinet.Ibid.  Later Life and Career  He moved back to his hometown Paks in 1979, and as a public educator, he founded the Paks Visual Experimental Retreat, an annually organized summer camp for artists, in the spirit of the Studio of Applied Arts of P√©cs. In 1991, Hal√°sz also co-founded and was appointed as the first director of the Paks Pallery, based on his neo-avant- garde collection. He received the Mih√°ly Munk√°csy Prize, the highest Hungarian state award for outstanding ≈ìuvres in fine arts, in 2006. After a long-term illness, he passed away in Paks on 27 November 2016.Perneczky, Ibid, 30-31. From the second half of the eighties, he returned to painting and joined the neo geo movement (Monolith Structures [1987‚Äì1988], Neo-Geo-pictures [1989];, Picture Plans [1991‚Äì2004]http://www.halaszkaroly.hu/gallery.php?p=04&lng;=en). In his Open Geometry series, from 1987, he juxtaposed elements of neo geo stripes and dots with his photographs, mainly depicting body parts of people from ethnic minorities.Cf Kovalovszky, Ibid, 48‚Äì49. , while some pieces from the Monolith Structures were combined with monochrome columns and mundane objects, such as chairs and baskets.See, Pinczehelyi, Ibid, 348‚Äì351.

One of the UAV currently under developed revealed at these exhibition is one with canards. This UAV takes a rather unusual layout in that at first glance, it appears to be in a slightly altered conventional layout with a small T-tail and tricycle landing gear, but there are a pair of canards mounted on the fuselage near the nose cone. This UAV also adopts a swept wing design, a rear occasion among Chinese UAVs. In addition, there are also winglets on the swept wing, but the winglets are not located at the wing tips as in most aircraft, but instead, near the wing tips. Very little information is further released since it is still under development. UAV with delta wing Another UAV currently being developed by Xinying and revealed together with the one with canards is more of traditional design, and this UAV has delta wings with twin tails and tricycle landing gear, but without tailplanes. There is not any propeller shown on the model shown at the exhibition, indicating that this UAV might be jet-powered, but none of models shown has any inlets. The staff of the developer at these exhibitions has claimed that the UAV can be powered by various power plants, including both propeller and jet, so if it is propeller-driven, it is likely to be in pusher configuration. Quadrotor The third UAV currently under development by Xinying is an experimental UAV and it is a quadcopter. What is unusual about this UAV is that it does not follow the traditional quadcopter design of four arms extending from the center and each with a rotor at the end of arm furthest from the center. Instead, the quadcopter has a fuselage attached with four ducted fans, with two on each side of the fuselage. Each ducted fan houses a two-blade rotor. The fuselage does not have any wings attach to it, but is does have a vertical rudder attached to the empennage.

The oceanic general circulation is defined as the horizontal space scale and time scale larger than mesoscale (of order 100 km and 6 months). They depict oceans using a three-dimensional grid that include active thermodynamics and hence are most directly applicable to climate studies. They are the most advanced tools currently available for simulating the response of the global ocean system to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. A hierarchy of OGCMs have been developed that include varying degrees of spatial coverage, resolution, geographical realism, process detail, etc. History The first generation of OGCMs assumed ‚Äúrigid lid‚Äù to eliminate high-speed external gravity waves. According to CFL criteria without those fast waves, we can use a bigger time step, which is not so computationally expensive. But it also filtered those ocean tides and other waves having the speed of tsunamis. Within this assumption, Bryan and co-worker Cox developed a 2D model, a 3D box model, and then a model of full circulation in GFDL, with variable density as well, for the world ocean with its complex coastline and bottom topography.K. Bryan, J. Comput. Phys. 4, 347 (1969) The first application with specified global geometry was done in the early 1970s.M. D. Cox, in Numerical Models of Ocean Circulation (National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC, 1975), pp. 107 120 Cox designed a 2¬∞ latitude-longitude grid with up to 12 vertical levels at each point. With more and more research on ocean model, mesoscale phenomenon, e.g. most ocean currents have cross-stream dimensions equal to Rossby radius of deformation, started to get more awareness. However, in order to analyze those eddies and currents in numerical models, we need grid spacing to be approximately 20 km in middle latitudes. Thanks to those faster computers and further filtering the equations in advance to remove internal gravity waves, those major currents and low-frequency eddies then can be resolved, one example is the three-layer quasi-geostrophic models designed by Holland.W. R. Holland, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 8, 363 (1978) Meanwhile, there are some model retaining internal gravity wave, for example one adiabatic layered model by O'Brien and his students, which did retain internal gravity waves so that equatorial and coastal problems involving these waves could be treated, led to an initial understanding of El Ni√±o in terms of those waves.A. J. Busalacchi and J. J. O'Brien, ibid. 10, 1929 (1980) In the late 1980s, simulations could finally be undertaken using the GFDL formulation with eddies marginally resolved over extensive domains and with observed winds and some atmospheric influence on density.Albert J. Semtner Furthermore these simulations with high enough resolution such as the Southern Ocean south of latitude 25¬∞,The FRAM Group, Eos 72, 169 (1991) the North Atlantic,F. O. Bryan, C. W. B√∂ning, W. R. Holland, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 25, 289 (1995) and the World Ocean without the Arctic A. J. Semtner and R. M Chervin, J. Geophys. Res. 97, 5493 (1992) provided first side-by-side comparison with data. Early in the 1990s, for those large-scale and eddies resolvable models, the computer requirement for the 2D ancillary problem associated with the rigid lid approximation was becoming excessive. Furthermore, in order to predict tidal effects or compare height data from satellites, methods were developed to predict the height and pressure of the ocean surface directly. For example, one method is to treat the free surface and the vertically averaged velocity using many small steps in time for each single step of the full 3D model.P. D. Killworth, D. Stainforth, D. J. Webb, S. M. Paterson, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 21, 1333 (1991) Another method developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory solves the same 2D equations using an implicit method for the free surface.J. K. Dukowicz and R. D. Smith, J. Geophys. Res. 99, 7991 (1994) Both methods are quite efficient. Importance OGCMs have many important applications: dynamical coupling with the atmosphere, sea ice, and land run-off that in reality jointly determine the oceanic boundary fluxes; transpire of biogeochemical materials; interpretation of the paleoclimate record;climate prediction for both natural variability and anthropogenic chafes; data assimilation and fisheries and other biospheric management.Chassignet, Eric P., and Jacques Verron, eds. Ocean modeling and parameterization. No. 516. Springer, 1998. OGCMs play a critical role in Earth system model. They maintain the thermal balance as they transport energy from tropical to the polar latitudes. To analyze the feedback between ocean and atmosphere we need ocean model, which can initiate and amplify climate change on many different time scales, for instance, the interannual variability of El Ni√±o S. G. Philander, El Ni√±o, La Nina, and the Southern Oscillation (Academic Press, San Diego, 1990) and the potential modification of the major patterns for oceanic heat transport as a result of increasing greenhouse gases.S. Manabe and R. J. Stouffer, Nature 364, 215 (1993) Oceans are a kind of undersampled nature fluid system, so by using OGCMs we can fill in those data blank and improve understanding of basic processes and their interconnectedness, as well as to help interpret sparse observations. Even though, simpler models can be used to estimate climate response, only OGCM can be used conjunction with atmospheric general circulation model to estimate global climate change.Showstack, Randy. \\"IPCC Report Calls Climate Changes Unprecedented.\\" Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union 94.41 (2013): 363‚Äì363 Subgridscale parameterization ocean parameterization scheme family tree Molecular friction rarely upsets the dominant balances (geostrophic and hydrostatic) in the ocean. With kinematic viscosities of v=10‚àí6m 2 s‚àí1 the Ekman number is several orders of magnitude smaller than unity; therefore, molecular frictional forces are certainly negligible for large-scale oceanic motions. A similar argument holds for the tracer equations, where the molecular thermodiffusivity and salt diffusivity lead to Reynolds number of negligible magnitude, which means the molecular diffusive time scales are much longer than advective time scale. So we can thus safely conclude that the direct effects of molecular processes are insignificant for large-scale. Yet the molecular friction is essential somewhere. The point is that large-scale motions in the ocean interacted with other scales by the nonlinearities in primitive equation. We can show that by Reynolds approach, which will leads to the closure problem. That means new variables arise at each level in the Reynolds averaging procedure. This leads to the need of parameterization scheme to account for those sub grid scale effects. Here is a schematic ‚Äúfamily tree‚Äù of subgridscale (SGS) mixing schemes. Although there is a considerable degree of overlap and interrelatedness among the huge variety of schemes in use today, several branch points maybe defined. Most importantly, the approaches for lateral and vertical subgridscale closure vary considerably. Filters and higher-order operators are used to remove small-scale noise that is numerically necessary. Those special dynamical parameterizations (topographic stress, eddy thickness diffusion and convection) are becoming available for certain processes. In the vertical, the surface mixed layer (sml) has historically received special attention because of its important role in air-sea exchange. Now there are so many schemes can be chose from: Price-Weller-Pinkel, Pacanowksi and Philander, bulk, Mellor-Yamada and KPP (k-profile parameterization) schemes. Adaptive (non-constant) mixing length schemes are widely used for parameterization of both lateral and vertical mixing. In the horizontal, parameterizations dependent on the rates of stress and strain (Smagroinsky), grid spacing and Reynolds number (Re) have been advocated. In the vertical, vertical mixing as a function stability frequency (N^2) and/or Richardson number are historically prevalent. The rotated mixing tensors scheme is the one considering the angle of the principle direction of mixing, as for in the main thermocline, mixing along isopycnals dominates diapycnal mixing. Therefore the principle direction of mixing is neither strictly vertical nor purely horizontal, but a spatially variable mixture of the two. Comparison with Atmospheric General Circulation Model OGCMs and AGCMs have much in common, such as, the equations of motion and the numerical techniques. However, OGCMs have some unique features. For example, the atmosphere is forced thermally throughout its volume, the ocean is forced both thermally and mechanically primarily at its surface, in addition, the geometry of ocean basins is very complex. The boundary conditions are totally different. For ocean models, we need to consider those narrow but important boundary layers on nearly all bounding surfaces as well as within the oceanic interior. These boundary conditions on ocean flows are difficult to define and to parameterize, which results in a high computationally demand. Ocean modeling is also strongly constrained by the existence in much of the world's oceans of mesoscale eddies with time and space scales, respectively, of weeks to months and tens to hundreds of kilometers. Dynamically, these nearly geostrophic turbulent eddies are the oceanographic counterparts of the atmospheric synoptic scale. Nevertheless, there are important differences. First, ocean eddies are not perturbations on an energetic mean flow. They may play an important role in the poleward transport of heat. Second, they are relatively small in horizontal extent so that ocean climate models, which must have the same overall exterior dimensions as AGCMs, may require as much as 20 times the resolution as AGCM if the eddies are to be explicitly resolved. Most of the difference between OGCMs and AGCMs is that the data are sparser for OGCMs. Also, the data are not only sparse but also nonuniform and indirect. Classification We can classify ocean models according to different standards. For example, according to vertical ordinates we have geo-potential, isopycnal and topography-following models. According to horizontal discretizations we have unstaggered or staggered grids. According to methods of approximation we have finite difference and finite element models. There are three basic types of OGCMs: # Idealized geometry models: Models with idealized basin geometry have been used extensively in ocean modeling and have played a major role in the development of new modeling methodologies. They use a simplified geometry, offering a basin itself, while the distribution of winds and buoyancy force are generally chosen as simple functions of latitude. # Basin-scale models: To compare OGCM results with observations we need realistic basin information instead of idealized data. However, if we only pay attention to local observation data, we don't need to run whole global simulation, and by doing that we can save a lot of computational resources. # Global models: This kind of model is the most computationally costly one. More experiments are needed as a preliminary step in constructing coupled Earth system models.

It is one of Cheshire's oldest cemeteries, and is located near the site of the first Baptist meetinghouse in the town. History Cheshire, Massachusetts was settled as \\"New Providence\\" in the 1760s by a group of Baptists from Rhode Island. The main settlement was on what is now called Stafford Hill, in honor of Joab Stafford, one of the settlement's leaders. In 1786 a deed transferring the cemetery plot to Joab Stafford was recorded, \\"for a burying place\\" for the local Baptist church. This deed may have been a formalization of a situation existing since at least 1779. Although ownership of the land seems to have remained with the church, it was constructively abandoned by the mid-20th century, and acquired by the town in 2006. The property was the original site of the first Baptist meetinghouse in the area. That building was moved c. 1820 to a lot on Stafford Hill Road, and was repurposed as a house; it has been much altered since. The cemetery is the burial site of many of Cheshire's earliest settlers, although it was not where Joab Stafford was buried. The names of 21 families are recorded on its gravestones, and three first settlers of the town are known to be interred there. Most of the early gravestones are plain marble, without any significant decoration. The iconography of the willow and urn came into fashion during the early 19th century, and appears on stones that date to that time. A small number of stones show Greek Revival features. Unlike later cemeteries of the rural cemetery movement, this cemetery was never formally organized, with lanes and formalized rows of graves.

Adams was sued by a former counter-intelligence official on the grounds the novel's main character bore too close a resemblance to his own life. Former Minister of National Defence Paul Hellyer wrote that information in the novel seemed sufficiently credible to alter the mandate of a high-profile inquiry into wrongdoing by the RCMP Security Service. Synopsis In the novel S is employed as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's official in charge of countering attempts by the Soviet Union to spy on Canada. In the novel S is a triple agent‚Äîa Soviet mole who has been recruited by the United States's Central Intelligence Agency. S has a long run, decades, as a successful spy. When his run does come to an end, he manages to evade Canadian authorities, and leave Canada. Peter Worthington and James Leslie Bennett Shortly after the novel was written Peter Worthington, a founding editor of the Toronto Sun, wrote to Leslie James Bennett, that he thought Bennett should consider suing Adams, as the novel too closely paralleled his own life. Worthington told Bennett that the character of the publisher of a tabloid newspaper had enough parallels that he could sue Adams. He told Bennett his lawyer, Julian Porter, thought Bennett had grounds to sue. Bennett did sue Adams. According to the Windsor Star Bennett was surprised to learn that it was a column by Worthington himself which first suggested the character of S was based on Bennett. Paul Hellyer's review In a 1977 review Paul Hellyer, a former Minister of National Defence, suggested other characters were strongly based on John Starnes, Bennett's boss, Solicitor General Jean-Pierre Goyer, Karl Kristian Ring, who he identifies as an arms dealer. Hellyer suggested he may have been the model for another character, Hellyer suggested the information in the novel was so explosive that the mandate of the MacDonald Commission that was then investigating wrongdoing on the part of the RCMP Security Service should be expanded to confirm or refute whether clandestine wrongdoing described in the novel actually took place. Play and film Rick Salutin would later write an essay on the trial, which was published together with the novel in a second edition. In 1984 Adams and Salutin collaborated on a play based on the novel. A script for the a feature film based on the book is in development.

The band was formed by a collaboration among Melissa (past member, bass), Stefano (guitar) and Becky (Celtic harp) in 2007. The band was formed upon the idea of playing new school Italian folk metal. They have released one demo album and three full-length album so far. Pagan was later added for vocals and Marco played the drums. Furor Gallico have songs in both English and in Italian, the band members take alternating roles in who writes the lyrics and composes the music in either language. The song Curmisagios was even written in dialetto brianzolo, a lombard dialect spoken in the area of Brianza, in western Lombardy. They make use of different types of vocals (growl, scream and clean vocals) combined with folk instruments such as Celtic harp, whistles, violin and bouzouki. Etymology Furor Gallico is the description that the ancient Romans had given to the state of blood lust that the Celtic Warriors, who were ready to attack in battle to defend their people and their land, had possessed. They claim that they are the bards who live to pass on the legends of the now lost Celtic Worlds. History The band formed in 2007 by Melissa (past member bass), Stefano (guitar) and Becky (Celtic harp). Pagan was added for vocals and Marco for the drums. The Celtic band did not feel complete and ready to make music until they invited Laura to play the violin and Oldhan to play as a second electric guitarist. The band started to play many live performances right off the bat, and later on they had met the multi-instrumentalist Merogaisus who added whistles, bouzouki and occasionally the bagpipes. In 2008, their first demo 390 b.c. - The Glorious Dawn had been recorded. Shortly after this release, Melissa had decided to leave the band for her own personal projects. This is when Mac had taken her position as bassist. The band started to grow to a very professional level. In 2009, Marco was forced to leave due to commitments to his university which led Simone to take control of the band. The band had then started to record their first full-length album by the name of Furor Gallico, identical to the band's name. The album was self-produced and distributed but had amazing success despite that. Furor Gallico is a really brutal Celtic/folk metal album, where growls, and power guitars are alternated with melodics harps, violin and whistles. In 2009/2010, they had composed music for the opera \\"Hamlet\\" on multiple stages in Northern Italy, including at the Teatro Coccia di Novara. In 2015 the band released their second album, Songs From The Earth, for Scarlet Records. Sword Chant, upon hearing their CD, reviewed them as the so- called Revelation of the Year.

High school He started for the varsity football team at Whitefish Bay High School at punter, placekicker and tight end as a junior and senior. He was an All-American selection by Sporting News, PrepStar and SuperPrep and played in the U.S. Army All-American Game. Hagerup committed to Michigan on September 27, 2009. Once he committed, he was projected to be the most likely Wolverine to be a true freshman starter, because starting punter Zoltan Mesko was graduating. He signed his National Letter of Intent with Michigan on February 3, 2010. He attended Michigan's spring football practice on March 23. Upon graduating, he was considered to be the third best placekicker in the national high school class of 2010 by ESPN and Rivals.com and the fourth best punter by Scout.com. However, he was more highly decorated as a punter: he received first team All-state recognition as a punter. College When Hagerup kicked a 72-yard punt for the 2010 Michigan team that stopped on the 3-yard-line against Purdue on November 13, 2010, it was the longest punt by a Wolverine since Monte Robbins' 82-yard punt on December 6, 1987 against .

Hagerup did not attend the 2013 Outback Bowl due to a violation of team rules. Hagerup's 45.03 yards per punt average surpassed Mesko's school single-season record of 44.46 yards per punt. On May 7, 2013, his suspension from the team was lifted although he was designated to sit out the 2013 season. He was a 2014 All-Big Ten honorable mention selection by the coaches.

Also, the upper story of a home or castle, often with a pitched roof. More broadly, the term is used by historians to discuss the elite social practice of female seclusion that reached its height in seventeenth-century Muscovy. Royal or noble women were not only confined to separate quarters, but were also prevented from socialization with men outside their immediate family, and were shielded from the public eye in closed carriages or heavily concealing clothing. The word is not to be confused with the Terem Palace in Moscow, an extended part of the Grand Kremlin Palace, which was not occupied exclusively by women.  Etymology  Although the origins of the terem as a Muscovite practice are still a matter of debate among historians, scholars generally agree that the word itself is derived from the Byzantine Greek word teremnon (Greek:œÑŒ≠œÅŒµŒºŒΩŒøŒΩ), meaning chamber or abode. Its usage in a Russian context has been dated to Kievan times. The word terem is in no way linguistically related to the Arabic word harem, as was mistakenly assumed by foreign travelers to Russia during the Muscovite period, as well as nineteenth-century Russian historians who thought it to be directly derived from the Islamic practice of enclosing the female members of a household. Parallels have been drawn between the terem and the South Asian practice of female physical seclusion, purdah, but this is also problematic due to a lack of evidence suggesting that the Muscovite terem was derived from foreign cultural practices (see Origins and Historiography). Original Muscovite sources often use the word ‚Äúpokoi,‚Äù but nineteenth-century historians popularized the word ‚Äúterem,‚Äù which became synonymous with the general practice of elite female seclusion.  Practice   As Women‚Äôs Quarters  Terem of tsarevnas (1878) by Michail Petrovitj Clodt Between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the seclusion of aristocratic women to separate quarters became a common practice among royal and boyar families. The terem was often a cloistered apartment within a home or castle, usually on an upper story or in a separate wing, from which all contact with unrelated males was forbidden. As a separate building, the women‚Äôs quarters might only be connected to the men‚Äôs by an outdoor passageway. The women‚Äôs quarters of the tsar‚Äôs palace were particularly elaborate and were equipped with a separate courtyard, dining room, and children‚Äôs apartments, as well as a whole envoy of maidservants, wet nurses, nannies, and ladies in waiting. Even in the late seventeenth century, when different rooms began to be distinguished for specific purposes, separate quarters for men and women were maintained in noble households. Daughters were often born and brought up solely within the confines of the terem, where they were isolated in accordance with Orthodox teachings regarding premarital virginity. They were taught by their mothers and other female relatives to become wives, spending most of their days in prayer or needlework. Indeed, except for short excursions, women did not leave their quarters until marriage, though they were permitted to receive visitors and leave their rooms to manage household affairs. Male children, on the other hand, were typically taken from their mother‚Äôs care around the age of seven to receive formal instruction at the hands of private tutors or their male family members.  As a Political and Social Institution  The practice of the terem strictly segregated aristocratic Muscovite women both from members of the opposite sex, as well as the public eye in general. Under the institution of the terem, aristocratic men and women were assigned to wholly separate spheres.Pushkareva, page83 Elite women were completely subordinate to their husbands and could not hold public office or power. Even tsaritsas were not crowned alongside their husbands, the first female co-ruler being Catherine I in 1724. However, in some ways, Muscovite women did have an advantage over their European counterparts in that they could hold property and manage their own dowries. Most importantly, though, mothers were given great authority in arranging marriages, which often had invaluable political and economic implications. Traditionally, they held immense influence over marriage selections for their children, both male and female, and even interviewed prospective candidates. For example, the Romanovs' ascension to power in 1613 was dependent on a marriage alliance formed between Anastasia Romanovna and Ivan IV in 1547, an alliance overseen by the mothers of both parties. Most of the petitions received by the tsaritsa were, in fact, requests for permission to marry. In this way, women were able to express some degree of political sway, a fact that has led some recent historians such as Isolde Thyret to question the degree to which women were politically repressed by the institution of the terem. These issues aside, the fact that the institution placed extreme restrictions on female mobility remains unquestionable. The primary function of the terem was political, as it was intended to protect a woman‚Äôs value in the marriage market. As in Islamic and Near Eastern societies, the veiling and seclusion of women allowed for greater control over a woman‚Äôs marriage choices, which often had immense political and economic implications. The seclusion of women and the practice of arranged marriage were fairly common in medieval and early modern European history, though Muscovite women were restricted to a greater degree. Though Orthodox belief emphasized the importance of virginity, to a greater degree was virginity valued as a measure of a woman‚Äôs worth when establishing political and economic alliances through marriage. Mothers had a traditional role in negotiating these arranged marriages, one of the few ways in which female political power could be manifested under the institution of the terem. Orthodox beliefs regarding menstruation may have also been used to justify the seclusion of women. Ecclesiastical regulations forbade menstruating women from entering in church buildings and participating in other activities, further justifying the segregation of women who were ‚Äúritually unclean.‚Äù The extent to which female mobility was restricted by the terem as an institution governing female behavior is evident in several different sources. In the sixteenth- century travel writings of the German diplomat, Sigismund von Herberstein, which provides the first record of female seclusion in Muscovy, it is noted that: :‚ÄúNo woman who walks in the street is deemed chaste or respectable. Thus wealthy or important people keep their women so shut up that no one can see or speak to them; they entrust them with nothing beyond sewing and spinning. The women conduct their domestic affairs by themselves with male servants‚Ä¶The women are rarely allowed to go to church, and much less often to visit friends, unless they have grown so old as to be beyond attention and suspicion.‚Äù A century later, German scholar Adam Olearius also observed the extent to which female movement was regulated: :‚ÄúAfter the wedding, the women are secluded in their chambers and rarely appear in company. They are more often visited by their friends than permitted to visit them...because they are mistrusted, they are rarely allowed out of the house, even to go to church.‚Äù This extended to seclusion from social and political affairs within the royal court. As noted by historian Brenda Meehan-Waters, ‚Äúpropriety demanded that ‚Äòif a Russian gives an Entertainment to Persons not related to him, the Mistress of the House does not appear at all or only just before Dinner, to make the Guests welcome with a Kiss and a Cup of Brandy, after which she makes her Poclan or Courtesy, and gets out of the Way again.‚Äô‚Äù The institution of the terem was even reflected in diplomatic practice, particularly in forging marriage alliances. Strict separation was maintained even between the betrothed. For example, during the marriage of Ivan III‚Äôs daughter Helena Ivanovna to Alexander, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, it was insisted upon that Helena use her own carriage and even stand on a separate carpet when meeting with her future husband. The terem as a social ideal was also exhibited in women‚Äôs dress of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Women traditionally wore heavily concealing clothing with high necks and long sleeves. They were often multi-layered and loose-fitting. Married women of all statuses were expected to cover their heads with a headdress like a kokoshnik, and shrouding or veiling was common. The terem also held a certain amount of social value. Seclusion was considered a mark of honor among aristocratic women, and a privilege out of the reach of the lower classes. Inside the terem walls, women were safe from attack and insult, as well as contact with people who might ‚Äúbesmirch their character.‚Äù It is important to note that this was a socially narrow practice, meaning that strict segregation of women was only practiced on the daughters and wives of wealthy boyars and the royal family. Women from the provincial gentry, merchant, and peasant classes did not have the ‚Äúeconomic means, nor the political incentive‚Äù to practice female seclusion, and often had to bear the same economic responsibilities as men. In this respect, peasant and town women were afforded greater freedom of movement. As Adam Olearius observed, speaking of the strict segregation of aristocratic women, ‚ÄúThese customs, however, are not strictly observed among the common people. At home the women go poorly attired except when they appear, at the order of their husbands, to render honor to a strange guest by sipping a cup of vodka to him, or when they go through the streets, to church, for example; then they are supposed to be dressed gorgeously, with their faces and throats heavily made up.‚Äù However, as seclusion was perceived as a mark of honor, all women ‚Äúmimicked the goals of seclusion by modest dress and public behavior, and by supporting a highly articulated system of honor‚Äù deeply influenced by Orthodox teaching.  In Folklore  The motif of the terem was frequently alluded to in folklore. One story immortalizes the lonely daughter of the tsar who ‚Äúsits behind three-times-nine locks; she sits behind three-times-nine keys; where the wind never blew, the sun never shone, and young heroes never saw her.‚Äù In popular songs, too, many allusions are made to the mysterious and symbolic seclusion of women. One wedding song references the symbolic emergence of the virtuous maiden from the seclusion of the terem, emphasizing the untouchable nature of the female sphere: ‚ÄúSo from the terem, the terem, From the fair, the lofty terem, The fair, the lofty, the bright, From under her mother‚Äôs care, Has come forth the fair maiden, Has come forth, has hastened out, The sweet fair maiden, Avdotyushka.‚Äù  Origins and Historiography  The origins of the terem are still a matter of historical debate among scholars. Unfortunately, due to a paucity of sources from the early Muscovite period, it is particularly difficult for historians to either determine the cultural origins of the practice of segregating elite women, or when it became a part of the social mainstream.  Chronological Origins  Historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries theorized that the terem was adopted from misogynistic practices of the Mongol Empire during the occupation of the Golden Horde, in the thirteenth century. The earliest source which references the terem does not appear until the sixteenth century, but it is uncertain how long it had been in practice prior to the writing of Sigismund von Herberstein‚Äôs 1557 account of Russia (see above, Practice). With Herberstein‚Äôs account, historians ‚Äúpostulate a radical change in women‚Äôs status during the time of Ivan III,‚Äù though it is unlikely that such a dramatic social change was undertaken so suddenly. This evidence has led several modern historians, including Nancy S. Kollman, to point to the end of the fifteenth century for the origins of female seclusion in Muscovy. This is further corroborated by the fact that the grand princesses of the fifteenth century, Sofiia Vitovtovna and Sofiia Palaiologina both received foreign envoys in 1476 and 1490, respectively. An elite society governed by strict segregation of the sexes, like that of the later period in Muscovy, would not have permitted women such participation in political affairs. According to Natalia Pushkareva, women in the pre-Muscovite era ‚Äúhad actively involved themselves in governmental affairs, had received ambassadors, led diplomatic missions, disseminated learning, and worked as physicians.‚Äù Indeed, royal women in the following century clearly lacked the level of political participation enjoyed by their fifteenth-century counterparts. As Kollmann points out, women are discussed in much the same way throughout the period from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries, suggesting that the terem was a gradual adoption over time, but that the position of elite women was limited throughout the Muscovite period. Other modern historians favor the view that the terem was a relatively recent innovation, some even going so far as to call it ‚Äúshort-lived‚Äù and hardly predating the Time of Troubles.  Cultural Origins  The other historiographic issue which dominates discussion on the terem is whether the practice itself was adopted externally from another culture or was a unique to Muscovite society. Historians previously thought that the terem was a practice of female seclusion borrowed from Mongol occupiers around the thirteenth century. However, this view is now outdated and generally discredited for assuming ‚ÄúOrientalizing‚Äù stereotypes of Russian culture common in popular literature of the time. Russian historian Vissarion Belinskii, writing on the reforms of Peter the Great, associated the terem and other ‚Äúbackward‚Äù institutions like ‚Äúburying money in the ground and of wearing rags for fear of revealing one‚Äôs wealth‚Äù as being the fault of Tatar influence. This tendency to associate repressive cultural practices with Mongol influence, claims Charles J. Halperin, constitutes an attempt to explain away ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs failings‚Äù by placing the blame on Mongol occupiers. Other claims that linked the terem to the Islamic harem or the South Asian purdah are faulty, if not completely unsubstantiated. The suggestion that the Muscovites borrowed female seclusion from the Mongols is impossible, as pointed out by Halperin, because the Mongols never practiced female seclusion, a view upheld by Kollmann and Ostrowski as well. In fact, women of the Chingisid dynasty and the wives and widows of the khan enjoyed relatively higher political power and social freedom. An alternative theory proposes that the practice was taken from the Byzantine Empire. Though Byzantine women were not secluded after the eleventh century, it remained a highly praised ideal that could have easily been adopted by visiting Muscovite churchmen, already deeply influenced by Orthodox teachings on gender and female roles. Although the exact origins of the practice remain a mystery, most historians now concede that the terem was actually an indigenous innovation, most likely developed in response to political changes that occurred during the sixteenth century.  Problems with Foreign Sources  Because many of the sources that describe the terem were written by foreign travelers, many scholars are skeptical of their validity and the degree to which they merely perpetuated European stereotypes of Russian ‚Äúbackwardness.‚Äù For example, historian Nada Boskovska argues that the Russian, Grigoii Kotoshikhin, who wrote a seventeenth-century account of Russia during the reign of Aleksei Mikhailovich for the king of Sweden, may have been merely fulfilling European stereotypes of Russian ‚Äúorientalism‚Äù when he described women as being secluded to ‚Äúsecret chambers‚Äù (tainye pokoi). Similar charges have been levied against the sixteenth-century travel accounts of Olearius and Von Herberstein. However, as most of the only surviving sources that describe the practice of the terem were written by foreign travelers, it is difficult to completely dismiss the evidence which they present.  History and Evolution   The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries  The first accounts by foreign travelers like Adam Olearius and Sigismund von Herberstein that described the institution of the terem first appeared in the sixteenth century. Though a lack of source evidence makes comparison with previous centuries difficult, historians generally agree that the practice of terem reached its height during the seventeenth century, during the Early Romanov dynasty. During this time, the political importance of upper-class women, even those who were members of the tsar‚Äôs family, clearly began to decline, as power became increasingly centralized in the person of the autocrat. Multiple accounts by foreign travelers described women as being in nearly constant seclusion and women and children in procession were observed as shrouded. Muscovite government also became more formalized and bureaucratic. As a result, traditional offices typically afforded to women of the imperial family, such as the reading of petitions by the tsaritsa, were transferred to officials of the court instead. At least for the family of the tsar, however, the terem was relatively short- lived and restrictions imposed on female members of the royal family were relaxed towards the end of the century. Strict rules governing female appearance in public were somewhat relaxed after the marriage of Tsar Aleksei to Natalia Naryshkina in 1671. Natalia, his second wife, was quick to abandon the practice of riding in a closed carriage, sparking public scandal. When Aleksei died, he left six daughters by his first marriage, most of whom began to appear in public and dress in a more European fashion. The regent Sophia (1682-1689), although greatly limited in her power, was also able to participate in activities of state and received foreign ambassadors. However, she too spent much of her time in her quarters and later, banishment in a convent. Still, by the end of the 1670s and 1680s, women began to appear unveiled in public and women began to play a greater role in the social functions of state.  Reign of Peter the Great and Abolition of the Terem  In 1718, Peter the Great (1682-1725) officially outlawed the seclusion of aristocratic women in the terem and ordered that they participate in the social functioning of the new, Western-style court at St. Petersburg. During this period, Peter sought to transform the nobility from a hereditary class to one whose status was dependent on service to the state. Thus, targeting familial norms was only one part of his ongoing agenda to destroy the ‚Äúclan politics‚Äù of the Muscovite period and to ‚Äúcreate a service nobility modeled on that of the West.‚Äù However, the forced introduction of women into the social organism of the court was met with resistance on certain fronts. Certainly, not all women were happy to attend the assemblies of court organized by Peter and adopt new clothing styles radically different from traditionally concealing garments. Traditionally, women were draped in heavily concealing clothing and were often veiled, but at the behest of Peter, royal women began to adopt clothing that closely mimicked revealing, Western-style gowns and corsets. Evidence also suggests that for many years the presence of noblewomen at court functions was only practiced in St. Petersburg. The practice was slow to die in many parts because, in the eyes of the conservative, the honor and reputation of wives and daughters were at stake. As late as 1713, foreign travelers observed that aristocratic Russian women were still kept ‚Äúextremely retired.‚Äù On the whole, however, the abolition of the terem greatly improved the legal and social status of noblewomen in Russia. The decision followed on the heels of Peter‚Äôs 1714 decree which abolished the distinction between military land grants and hereditary estates, giving women the ability to inherit all her husband‚Äôs lands. Socialization and new forms of leisure and luxury obliterated the terem and female seclusion as an institution. Women, by law, were now allowed to have a say in the choice of their marriage partners and the education of elite women was made a priority, later carried out by Catherine the Great.

She was the second wife of Country Music Hall of Fame member Red Foley and is the grandmother of Christian country music singer Debby Boone. Early life Overstake was born in Decatur, Illinois, the third of six children of Herschel Jewel Overstake (1894-1936) and Helen Elizabeth Nalefski (1897-1988). When Eva was 12 years old her father arranged for her and her two older sisters, Evelyn and Lucille to sing three-part harmonies for The Salvation Army on street corners in Decatur. Before long the Overstake sisters were performing on local radio stations WJBL, WDZ and WTAX. Professional career In the fall of 1931 Herschel Overstake took his three daughters to Chicago to audition for radio station WLS. The program director was so impressed with their performance in the audition he immediately scheduled them for a guest appearance the following Saturday on the WLS National Barn Dance. The girls were an immediate hit with the WLS listeners and they were hired for regular Saturday night appearances on the show to begin in January 1932. The Three Little Maids WLS station management renamed them the Three Little Maids and they were on their way to fame and fortune. By the time of the audition, the oldest sister, Evelyn, then 17, was married and had a child. Lucille was one year younger and Eva was just 14. Herschel Overstake moved his wife and children to Chicago and became their manager. The girls continued to perform and record their music and became acquainted with other regular WLS performers such as Gene Autry, George Gobel, The Hoosier Hot Shots, Red Foley, and others. Foley took an interest in young Eva. In 1933, six months after his first wife Pauline died in childbirth, he married Eva Overstake. The \\"Three Little Maids\\" continued to perform and record as a trio and by 1933 had their own daily radio show on WLS in addition to regular performances on the National Barn Dance. On October 13, 1933 they drew an audience of 10,000 at the Chicago World's Fair. By the end of 1933, with two of the \\"Three Little Maids\\" married, differing personal and professional goals caused the Overstate sisters to dissolve their act. At the end of 1933 Eva was expecting her first child and needed to diminish her musical performances. Evelyn continued to perform as a solo act at WLS. Lucille continued to perform and write songs and eventually became very successful under the name of Jenny Lou Carson. For a brief period Eva Foley formed a duo named the Play Party Girls with Jean Harris, wife of Karl Davis (one half of the Karl & Harty duo). She also sang occasionally with her sister Lucille at farm meetings throughout the Midwest and with her husband Red Foley. In March 1940 Eva and Red returned to WLS after a 31-month absence. Eva remained a regular on the WLS National Barn Dance until 1947. Personal life Eva Overstake, only 16 years old, married Red Foley, seven years her senior, on August 9, 1933. They kept the marriage secret for a brief period of time. On April 24, 1934, she gave birth to a daughter; Shirley Lee Foley. Their second child, Julie Ann, was born on April 18, 1938. On May 30, 1940, their third daughter, Jenny Lou, was born. Shirley wed actor-singer Pat Boone in 1953. Their daughters are Cheryl Lynn, Linda Lee, Laura Gene and country and Christian music singer Debby Boone. Death On Saturday, November 17, 1951, Eva Foley age 34, died at her Nashville, Tennessee home from an overdose of sleeping pills.

It is a metabolite of cholesterol that is produced by the enzyme CYP27A1. A link between high cholesterol and breast cancer has been identified, and it has been proposed that this is due to 27-HC production by CYP27A1. Because of its estrogenic action, 27-HC stimulates the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells, and has been implicated in limiting the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer. As such, identified CYP27A1 inhibitors, including the marketed drugs anastrozole, fadrozole, bicalutamide, dexmedetomidine, ravuconazole, and posaconazole, have been proposed as potential adjuvant therapies in ER-positive breast cancer.

Political life Bajoie received a bachelor's degree in political science from historically black Southern University in Baton Rouge. At the age of twenty-seven, she was initially elected in 1975 to the Louisiana House of Representatives from District 91 in her native New Orleans. At the time, the state instituted its unique nonpartisan blanket primary. In her first term, she was the only woman among the 105 House members. Early in 1991, she left the House after becoming the first black female ever elected to the Louisiana State Senate. This was twenty-five years after Barbara Jordan achieved the same distinction in neighboring Texas. Bajoie's Senate service began in District 5 in February 1991, when she won a special election to succeed African-American state Senator-turned-U.S. Representative William J. Jefferson. Bajoie polled 53 percent of the vote over four opponents from both parties in a low-turnout contest. She held the Senate seat until 2008, when she was term-limited by Louisiana law. As a legislator, Bajoie was an advocate for school-based health clinics. She worked to establish the Minority Health Care Commission and sought to expand health care coverage for citizens with mental disorders. She worked to establish the Louisiana State Museum on Civil Rights as well as the expansion and renaming of the New Orleans Convention Center to honor Ernest Morial, who was elected in 1978 as the first black mayor of New Orleans.

But unbeknownst to them, a plan is secretly being put into place by a well-hidden Peter Pan (Robbie Kay) that will shake up the very lives of the townspeople. Meanwhile, in the Fairytale Land that was, Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming‚Äôs (Josh Dallas) honeymoon turns out to be anything but romantic when they go in search of a mythical being that could stop Regina (Lana Parrilla) cold in her tracks.

Upon airing, the episode also saw a slight increase in ratings, with 6.94 million viewers and an 18-49 rating of 2.1. Plot Opening Sequence Medusa appears in the forest. In the Characters' Past At the Kingdom castle, Snow White and Prince Charming prepare for their wedding day. But just moments after they are married, Regina's threatening the whole kingdom, which will lead up to events of the curse. This threat causes Snow White to postpone her honeymoon, but relents to Charming and says they'll go to the Summer Palace instead. After Charming carries Snow over the threshold, and after he leaves the room, Snow, who actually had other plans to defeat her stepmother, puts on her archer's outfit and jumps out the window, unaware that Charming was waiting for her, as he predicted that she was planning something behind his back. Snow tells her husband that her plan was to travel to the Gorgon Cave, where she hopes to find the Greek mythical individual known as Medusa by cutting off her head and sending it to Regina so she will turn to stone. Believing this is too risky for Snow, Charming insists on coming along anyway. As the couple arrive inside the Gorgon Cave, Snow and Charming seek out Medusa by playing cat and mouse. Unfortunately, Snow's sword disintegrates upon making contact with Medusa's neck and worse yet, Charming looks up at the wrong moment after he sees Medusa, and he turns to stone. Regina then contacts Snow through her rippled shield and taunts her stepdaughter for destroying her own happiness ‚Äì she never lifted a finger to get Snow in mortal danger, she did it all by herself. This leads Snow to realize she can get Medusa to destroy herself by looking at Medusa's face in the shield, which is as shiny as a mirror. The ploy works and Medusa turns herself into stone, resulting in Charming returning to human form. The two decide to give up their plans to destroy Regina and they return to the Summer Palace, where Snow later admits to Charming that she was obsessed with defeating Regina because she wants to have a baby. But now that she realizes whether or not the Evil Queen's threat will happen, they have to move forward. In Storybrooke As the individuals return from Neverland in their triumphant rescue of Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), we also discover that Ariel has reunited with Prince Eric, working as a fisherman, and hugs her. The Jolly Roger flies in for a landing and Wendy reunites with her brothers, and the entire town breaks out a joyous reunion of hugs and congratulations. Amidst the celebration, Henry (whose body is occupied by Peter Pan) wants to \\"punish\\" Felix, who is in on the secret, as Pan is ready to set his plan in motion. All parties tell \\"Henry\\" that as long as \\"Peter Pan\\" (whose body is occupied by Henry) is inside Pandora's Box, he will never escape and only Gold can release it. Meanwhile, over at Granny's, Hook tells Neal he is planning to back off of going after Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), thinking that Emma is going to reject Neal, who then talks to Emma about a lunch date to break the ice after 11 years. Around the same time, and despite support from Regina, Mother Superior won't give Tinker Bell back her wings because Tinker Bell doesn't believe in herself enough to keep the pixie dust alive. After Henry (Pan) tells Emma that he wants to stay with Regina, she begins to suspect that Henry is exhibiting strange behavior. As Regina returns to her home, Pan then stalks around Henry's \\"old room,\\" then as Regina comes in he asks her about Regina's magic vault, pretending he wants it to protect himself from Pan. Regina tells him the vault is sealed because it's dangerous, and after she puts the book down, which Pan has been studying, she tucks him in. As soon as she leaves the room, Pan opens the window, and summons the Shadow, who breaks free from the Jolly Roger sails and starts flying. At Granny's the next day, Gold gives David the antidote to the dreamshade poison. Gold however asked David that there will be no price for this cure but will ask for a future favor. After David drinks the potion, he kisses Mary Margaret and tells her he's ready to restart a family, even though Mary Margaret tells David \\"Well, not right now!\\" Mary Margaret also explains to David that she's sad because she sees Neal eating alone, so Emma didn't take her advice. Emma is outside and is concerned about what has happened to Henry, but David gives his daughter a pep talk that good things are happening too. As he leads her back to the caf√©, Emma wonders if he isn't really just trying to keep her away from Hook. While Emma and David share their father/daughter moment, Hook is flirting with Tinker Bell in the hallway of the rooms in Granny's Inn when they hear a scream and go running out. The two, along with Emma and David discover that the Shadow is chasing down the Mother Superior, and kills her. Hook knows the Shadow only takes orders from one person, and that person is now in Storybrooke: Peter Pan. It turns out that Pan (as Henry) needs Regina to protect him due to the protection spell. When Emma tells Regina something's off with Henry, Regina replies that Emma forgets that Regina had 10 years of soothing him. Regina then takes \\"Henry\\" to the Vault, where he sees a sleeping potion and uses it on her. Emma suspects Pan is using the Shadow from inside the box, so she convinces Gold to release the box by taking it outside the line of Storybrooke, in a world with no magic. As Emma crosses the line, as she is the only one not affected by the curse, Gold opens the box and Peter Pan (who is actually Henry) suddenly appears and looks confused, calling Emma \\"mom\\". As Mary Margaret, David and Belle witness this, Emma holds him off with a gun but Gold insists she shoot him, until Emma asks \\"Pan\\" to tell her something only Henry would know, then convinces everyone when he tells her that they first connected in \\"his castle,\\" and Emma believes him. As everyone hugs the \\"Real Henry,\\" Gold apologizes for doubting him. The individuals then join Hook, Neal and Tinker Bell at the Vault, where after Gold pries open the door, they find Regina on the floor and Gold revives her. As Regina embraces the \\"Real Henry\\" after they hugged, Gold discovers that Pan has stolen the scroll that contained the Curse that brought everyone to Storybrooke, except this time there's nothing that even Regina and Emma can do. And as \\"Henry\\" and Felix look over the entire town, Pan reveals that once they enact the Curse, the residents will once again lose their memories and that Pan will turn Storybrooke into \\"the new Neverland.\\" Reception Ratings After two weeks of declining numbers from the previous outings, this installment posted an increase this time around, scoring a 2.1/5 among 18-49s with 6.94 million viewers tuning in.

We > know Henry (well, Pan in Henry's body) is going to put some nefarious plan > into action, and everyone will fall for it because their defenses are down, > and the pieces will be put in place for a bang-up midseason finale next > week. Still, there are a few surprises, like the appearance of a really > cheesy-looking Medusa. The scope of the show is getting a little broad, in > that Greek mythology (Pandora's box and Medusa), Arthurian legend and Mary > Shelley's favorite monster all fall under the fairytale banner. But I guess > as long as we don't see ewoks, hobbits or the cast of \\"Glee\\" in any future > episodes, I guess it's all fine. Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly criticized the episode's (and show's) excessive use of the flashback, saying \\"Perhaps instead, the show could simply try cutting way back on glimpses into the pasts of Snow White, Prince Charming, Regina, and Rumpelstiltskin -- unless those glimpses convey crucial new information that's actually relevant to the show's main narrative arc. (Lil' Rumpel's trip to Never Land with his dad would count; Regina's brief encounter with Tinker Bell wouldn't.)\\" Kylie Peters of Den of Geek gave Jared Gilmore's portrayal of the body-switched Henry a positive review, saying \\"Most of the episode revolves around Pan‚Äôs machinations for Storybrooke domination in Henry‚Äôs body. Jared Gilmore does a good job as body-switched-Pan, which I take as proof of my theory that Gilmore is not a bad actor, Henry is just a poorly-written character. Robbie Kay, playing body-switched-Henry, is significantly less convincing this week. I rest my case;\\" she was, however, more critical of the episode's cliffhanger, saying \\"Apparently, amnesiacs accept teenage dictators as entirely legitimate. I thought we were done with the curse plotline? Does that really need to be resurrected?\\" Lily Sparks of TV.com gave the episode a negative review, noting the show's returning to old themes, saying \\"there was definitely a sense of \\"This again?\\" in \\"The New Neverland.\\" Maybe it was just Ginnifer Goodwin's wig that was giving me deja vu.\\"http://www.tv.com/shows/once-upon-a-time-2011/community/post/once-upon-a- time-the-new-neverland-review-138637050755/ References External links 2013 American television episodes Once Upon a Time (season 3) episodes Cultural depictions of Medusa ","title":"The New Neverland"},{"id":"41245041","text":"The Voluntary Euthanasia Party is a minor political party in Australia, founded in early 2013 by Corey McCann to advocate for legislative change to allow voluntary euthanasia in Australia. The party's inception was strongly supported by Dr Philip Nitschke, director of Exit International and Richard Mills, then President of Dying with Dignity NSW. The VEP was registered as a political party in June 2013.Application for registration approved ‚Äì Voluntary Euthanasia Party, Australian Electoral Commission, 1 June 2013.  History  The party was founded in 2013 to bring attention to the need for voluntary assisted dying law reform and to bring together advocates from the Dying with Dignity and Exit International movements. The immediate goal of the VEP was to make voluntary euthanasia a central issue at the September 2013 Federal election. In December 2019, the VEP's NSW branch voted overwhelmingly to become the NSW branch of the Reason Party, on the grounds that being a single issue political party was a liability, and the Reason party were established supporters of voluntary euthanasia. Reason party leader Fiona Patten also stated the merger made sense for Reason as they did not have a branch in NSW, where VEP was well established. However, the non-NSW states and the federal VEP remain active.  Executive committee  Professor Ranjan Ray, former President of the Western Australia Voluntary Euthanasia Society, was the first convenor of the Party, and was succeeded by Kerry Bromson in October 2014. Philip Nitschke, the founder of Exit International, was the Deputy Convenor until October 2016, followed by Kym Buckley (2016‚Äì2017), and Shayne Higson (2017‚Äì2019). The Party Secretaries have been Corey McCann (2013‚Äì2015), Sandi Steep (2015‚Äì2016), David Mahoney (2016‚Äì2017), Sue Inglis (2018) and Julie Hanley (2018‚Äì2019). The Party Treasurers have been Jane Stabb (2013‚Äì2015), Justin Templer (2015‚Äì2016) and Sandi Steep (2016‚Äì2019).  Definitions  There is no universally agreed definition of \\"voluntary euthanasia\\". Terms like dying with dignity, physician-assisted dying, physician-assisted suicide and voluntary assisted dying are also used. The VEP regards voluntary euthanasia as involving a request by a terminally or incurably ill person for medical assistance to end his or her life painlessly and peacefully. A doctor may administer the medication or prescribe medication that the patient self- administers.  Election campaigns  The VEP participated in six Australian elections. They did not won any seats, though increased their percentage of votes at each re-contested election.  Federal The VEP nominated seven candidates at the 2013 Australian federal election: six candidates for the Senate (two each in New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory); and a candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Solomon in the Northern Territory. Three of the candidates were terminally ill. The VEP received 21,854 first preference votes in the Senate (0.16% of votes), while the sole House of Representatives candidate received 597 votes. The VEP nominated seven candidates at the 2016 Australian federal election: six candidates for the Senate (two each in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria); and a candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Menzies in Victoria. The VEP received 23,252 first preference votes in the Senate (0.17% of votes), while the sole House of Representatives candidate received 973 votes. The VEP did not run any candidates in the 2019 Australian federal election, rather they focused on canvasing the views of major candidates in key electorates. Victorian state elections The VEP fielded ten candidates in five Victorian Legislative Council regions at the 2014 Victorian state election on 29 November 2014. The lead candidate was Dr Fiona Stewart, public health sociologist and co-author of four books about end of life issues including The Peaceful Pill Handbook. The VEP received 16,772 first preference votes (0.49% of votes). The VEP fielded sixteen candidates in eight Victorian Legislative Council regions at the 2018 Victorian state election on 24 November 2018. The VEP received 42,611 first preference votes (1.19% of votes). New South Wales state elections The VEP stood sixteen candidates for the New South Wales Legislative Council in the 2015 New South Wales state election on 28 March 2015. The lead candidate was Shayne Higson. Higson began advocating for voluntary assisted dying legislation after her mother died from a brain tumour in 2012. The VEP received 40,710 votes (0.94% of votes). The VEP stood sixteen candidates for the New South Wales Legislative Council in the 2019 New South Wales state election on 23 March 2019. Shayne Higson resumed her role as lead candidate. The VEP received 46,971 votes (1.06% of votes). Higson finished in 26th place out of 364 candidates; seats were awarded to those who finished in the top 21 places.

He was the younger brother of the naturalist Leonard Dupont and many references in old French works merely mention Monsieur Dupont which has led to confusion between the two although in some works Leonard is referred to as the senior Dupont senior (a√Æn√©) and Henry as the younger (jeune). For the larger part Henry was into beetles and entomology while Leonard was more associated with birds. Many species of beetle were named by Henry Dupont and some are named after him by others. Henry or Henri was born at Bayeux on 1 November 1798 (Leonard in 10 January 1796) to wig-maker Jean- Antoine Puech dit Dupont and his wife Marie-Francoise Badin. They were baptized with the surname Puech dit Dupont but in later life they were known only as Dupont. Both the boys (a third died young) were interested in natural history and their mother was a conchologist of some repute. The malacologist L.C. Kiener named Conus dupontii from a specimen in her collections as did Leon de Joannis in Cyrenoida dupontia. She is also mentioned in Boitard and Canivet's manual Manuel du naturaliste preparateur (1828) where she is credited for a method of compact arrangement of butterfly specimens for transport. Henry studied at Paris and worked at the Jardin des Plantes before becoming a dealer in specimens of natural history for nearly thirty years. He ran his enterprise from Quai Saint-Michel and sold insect specimens as well as wax-models of species for entomogists. He bought from other collectors and supplied them to others including Dejean who named several species after Dupont including Cicindela duponti (Dejean, 1826) although some specimens such as from Tripoli were obtained from older brother Leonard who travelled briefly in Africa. Cicindela duponti Henry became a prolific collector with nearly 10000 specimens in 1828 with an additional 15000 specimens from Madagascar from Jules Goudot. He became a member of the Societe Entomologique de France in 1832 and wrote many papers on new specimens. Around 1846 he retired from the business and began to dispose his collections with 23000 going to a Polish Count Jerzy Wandalin Mniszech (1822‚Äì1881) and another sent to Odessa with the help of writer Honore de Balzac. In 1849 he resigned from the entomological society of France. With the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, he fled his home in Bellevue and moved to central Paris and was only rarely seen at the Museum National d‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle. After the war he returned to his much damaged home and died there about two years later on 2 July 1873. He was married to Rose Marguerite Julie Baudry from 1823 and had at least two children who survived him. The son Francois Henri transferred about 350 bird sternums to the natural history museum in Paris and some of his specimens came back to the museum through the collections of Oberthur.

Kindler. Consolation, consolement, and solace are terms referring to psychological comfort given to someone who has suffered severe, upsetting loss, such as the death of a loved one. It is typically provided by expressing shared regret for that loss and highlighting the hope for positive events in the future. Consolation is an important topic arising in history, the arts, philosophy, and psychology. In the field of medicine, consolation has been broadly described as follows: In some contexts, particularly in religious terminology, consolation is described as the opposite or counterpart to the experience of \\"desolation\\", or complete loss.David A. Leeming, Kathryn Madden, Stanton Marlan, Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion (2010), p. 240.  History  The desire to console others is an expression of empathy, and appears to be instinctual in primates. Dutch primatologist Frans de Waal has observed acts of consolation occurring among non-human primates such as chimpanzees.Frans de Waal, The Age of Empathy: Nature's Lessons for a Kinder Society (2009), p. 194. The formal concept of consolation as a social practice has existed since ancient times. For example, as an examination of letters from ancient Rome indicates of that culture: Although \\"[t]he most frequent occasion for consolation was death\\", ancient consolation literature addressed other causes for consolation, including \\"exile, poverty, political failure, illness, shipwreck, and old age\\".Michael Gagarin, The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Volume 1 (2010), p. 281. Papyrus letters from that era \\"often employ standard consolations, such as 'death is common to all' and frequently mention the dispatch of food stuffs\\". It is noted that food may have been offered as a further consolation to the bereaved, or may have had a religious purpose. It is reported that in the Fifth Century BCE, the Sophist, Antiphon, set up a booth in a public agora where he offered consolation to the bereaved. Furthermore, \\"[v]isits of consolation in antiquity extended to popular levels as well\\", including visits by philosophers intended to hearten villages that were facing invasion.Abraham Smith, Comfort One Another: Reconstructing the Rhetoric and Audience of 1 Thessalonians (1995), p. 48. In both ancient Greece and Rome, the Consolatio or consolatory oration was a type of ceremonial oration, typically used rhetorically to comfort mourners at funerals. It became one of the most popular classical rhetoric topics.Ernst Robert Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, trans. W.R. Trask (Princeton: 1953) section 5.1 Topics of Consolatory Oratory pp.80-2Petrie, Graham (1970) \\"A Rhetorical Topic in 'Tristram Shandy' \\", Modern Language Review, Vol. 65, No. 2, April 1970, p. 262 The Platonist philosopher Crantor of Soli (c. 325‚Äìc. 275 BC), a member of Plato's Academy, pioneered the writing of essays in this distinct tradition. Although only fragments of his essays have survived, his influence is noted in the works of later writers, particularly Cicero's Tusculan Disputations and Plutarch's Consolation to Apollonius.Baltussen, Han. \\"Personal grief and public mourning in Plutarch's consolation to his wife\\", American Journal of Philology 130 (2009): 67-67. July-Aug. 2009. :\\" Introduction: Beginnings of consolation.\\" Seneca the Younger (4 BC‚Äì65 AD) produced the most recognizable examples of Consolatio in his three Consolations, Ad Marciam, Ad Polybium, and Ad Helviam Matrem. The most recognizable example of Consolatio in verse form was written by the pseudo-Ovidian, Consolatio ad Liviam.Scourfield, J. H. D. Consoling Heliodorus: a commentary on Jerome, Letter 60. N.p.:Oxford UP, 1993. Google Books. Web. 19 July 2009. pp. 15‚Äì22 Plutarch's works include three works constructed in the Consolatio tradition: De exilio, Consolatio ad uxorem, Consolatio ad Apollonium. Historically and philosophically, consolation plays an important symbolic role in the sixth century work, Consolation of Philosophy. The author, Boethius, describes himself as being consoled by \\"Lady Philosophy\\" (a personification of philosophy) after having been sentenced to death for alleged crimes against the state.John Marenbon, The Cambridge Companion to Boethius (2009), p. 308. Taken literally, Boethius consoles himself for the anguish of knowing that his death has been decreed by philosophizing. Religious figures are often depicted as offering consolation to their followers during times of grief. For example, in the Mahabharata, the Hindu avatar Krishna consoles his brother Balarama and the princess Sathya Bama after they have been humiliated for their prideful ways.M. Padmanabhan, Meera Ravi Shankar, Tales of Krishna from Mahabharatha (2004), p. 46. More famously, in the Bhagavad Gita, when Arjuna learned that Krishna was dying of an injury, Krishna consoled him with touching philosophy.Hullasa Behera, 50 Flowers From Bhagavad Gita (1998), p. 17. In Christianity, one of the iconic Stations of the Cross is sometimes titled, \\"Jesus consoles the daughters of Jerusalem\\".J√°n Majern√≠k, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt, The Synoptics: On the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke (2005), p. 188. A substantial body of Christian literature exists exhorting followers to take consolation in their faith for the various ills that befall them in life. One branch of Christianity, Catharism, practiced a sacrament called consolamentum, which required consolation for the inevitable regret of living in order to move nearer to God or to approach heaven.  In the arts  Consolation is also a classical theme in the arts.Karen E. Smythe, Figuring Grief: Gallant, Munro, and the Poetics of Elegy (1992). The poetic form of elegy, for example, has been described as \\"a verbal presentation or staging of emotion, wherein the detached speaker engages the audience with the intent of achieving some form of cathartic consolation\\". Examples of literary devices which may be used to provide consolation include prosopopoeia, wherein an author or speaker may provide a representation of the ongoing thoughts or opinions of a deceased person.  In competition  In some kinds of competitions, losing competitors receive some form of award or recognition as a consolation for their loss. This may come in the form of a consolation prize given to a runner-up, or a consolation match in a sports tournament, wherein the top two teams compete for first and second place, while the next two teams compete for the prize of the third-place finish. An example of this occurs in the Iliad, where Homer writes of an incident where Achilles is judging sporting contests being held among the Greeks during the funeral of Patroclus. During a chariot race, Eumelus, who is known to be a great chariot driver, has a crash that causes him to come in last. Achilles expresses a desire to give Eumeles the second- place prize, a consolation prize in recognition of the losing participant's merit as a charioteer. This effort to award a consolation prize is thwarted by the actual second-place participant, Antilochus who successfully objects that the prize should go to the competitor whose performance met the requirements of winning the prize.David Potter, The Victor's Crown: A History of Ancient Sport from Homer to Byzantium (2011), p. 28-29.

If levels of NADH are low, the enzyme catalyses the reverse reaction, from cortisol to cortisone, using NAD+ as a co-factor. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid that plays a variety of roles in many different biochemical pathways, including, but not limited to: gluconeogenesis, suppressing immune system responses and carbohydrate metabolism. One of the symptoms of cortisone reductase deficiency is hyperandrogenism, resulting from activation of the Hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis. The deficiency has been known to exhibit symptoms of other disorders such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in women. Cortisone Reductase Deficiency alone has been reported in fewer than ten cases in total, all but one case were women. Elevated activity of 11Œ≤-HSD1 can lead to obesity or Type II Diabetes, because of the role of cortisol in carbohydrate metabolism and gluconeogenesis.  Signs and symptoms  Cortisol inhibition, and as a result, excess androgen release can lead to a variety of symptoms. Other symptoms come about as a result of increased levels of circulating androgen. Androgen is a steroid hormone, generally associated with development of male sex organs and secondary male sex characteristics The symptoms associated with Cortisone Reductase Deficiency are often linked with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in females. The symptoms of PCOS include excessive hair growth, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, and infertility. In men, cortisone reductase deficiency results in premature pseudopuberty, or sexual development before the age of nine.  Genetics  Inactivating mutations in the H6PD gene lead to a lowered supply of NADH, causing cortisone reductase to catalyze the reaction from cortisol to cortisone. This is the most common manifestation of CRD. It has been shown that CRD can be caused by mutations in the HSD11B1 gene as well, specifically mutations caused by K187N and R137C, affecting active site residue and disruption of salt bridges at the subunit interface of the dimer, respectively. In the K187N mutant, activity is abolished, and in the R137C mutant activity is greatly reduced, but not completely abolished.  Pathophysiology  An overview of how cortisone reductase is driven by NADH production by hexose-6-phosphate and how it affects the HPA Axis in a healthy body. Cortisone Reductase Deficiency effects on HPA and body in presence of deficient H6PD In a healthy body, blood cortisone and cortisol levels are roughly equimolar. Cortisone reductase deficiency leads to an elevated level of inert cortisone to active cortisol in adipose tissue. Cortisone reductase deficiency is caused by dysregulation of the 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 enzyme, otherwise known as cortisone reductase. The 11Œ≤-HSD1 enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the interconversion of circulating cortisone to cortisol, using NADH as a co-factor. The oxidative or reductive capacity of the enzyme is regulated by NADH produced by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD). H6PD is distinct from its isozyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in that G6PDH is a cytolytic enzyme and draws from a separate pool of NAD+. H6PD is also capable of catalyzing the oxidation of several phosphorylated hexoses, while G6PDH shows affinity for glucose, specifically. The enzyme cortisone reductase exists in a tightly controlled reaction space, facing the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum of cells in the liver and lungs. NADH produced by hexose-6-phosphate is delivered directly to the catalytic site of cortisone reductase. If NADH production is limited, then cortisone reductase is also capable of catalysing the reverse reaction taking circulating cortisol and reducing it to cortisone. Dysregulation of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase occurs as a result of gene mutation. Cortisol is important in signalling inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone release from the pituitary. Reduced cortisol in circulation activates the H-P-A Axis to produce and release more cortisol, and therefore androgen.  Effect on HPA Axis  The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis relies on blood levels of cortisol to act as negative feedback. Low levels of blood cortisol leads to release of Corticotrope Releasing Hormone (CRH) activating the anterior pituitary and signalling the release of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH), stimulating the adrenal gland to make more cortisol. In addition to cortisol, the adrenal gland also releases androgen, leading to hyperandrogenism, which gives rise to the symptoms commonly associated with Cortisone Reductase Deficiency.  Diagnosis Diagnosis of cortisone reductase deficiency is done through analysis of cortisol to cortisone metabolite levels in blood samples. Treatment There is no treatment for cortisone reductase deficiency. Shots of cortisol are quickly metabolised into cortisone by the dysregulated 11Œ≤-HSD1 enzyme; however, symptoms can be treated. Treatment of hyperandroginism can be done through prescription of antiandrogens. They do so by inhibiting the release of gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone, both hormones in the pituitary, responsible for the production of testosterone.

He is currently the op-ed editor of the New York Post, a contributing editor of The Catholic Herald, and a columnist for First Things. Previously, he served as a columnist and editor with The Wall Street Journal opinion pages in New York and London, and as a senior writer at Commentary. Ahmari is the author of The New Philistines (2016), a polemic on how identity politics are corrupting the arts, and From Fire, by Water (2019), a spiritual memoir about his conversion to Roman Catholicism. Early life and education Ahmari was born in Tehran, Iran. In his 2012 book, Arab Spring Dreams, he writes that he was interrogated by security officials about his parents and faced disciplinary action as a child for accidentally bringing a videocassette of Star Wars into school at a time when Western films were officially banned in the country. In 1998, at the age of 13, Ahmari moved with his family to the United States. Ahmari earned a J.D. degree from Northeastern University School of Law in Boston. Between college and law school, Ahmari had completed a two-year commitment to Teach for America in the Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas. While in law school, inspired in part by the protests following the disputed June 2009 Iranian presidential election, he began working as a freelance journalist, contributing pieces to publications such as The Boston Globe, The Wall Street Journal, The New Republic, The Chronicle of Higher Education, and Commentary among others. Career After serving as a Robert L. Bartley fellow at The Wall Street Journal in 2012, Ahmari joined the publication as assistant books editor. He then served as an editorial page writer based in London, where he wrote editorials and commissions and edited op-eds for the Journal's European edition. In these positions, Ahmari wrote book reviews, op-eds, and conducted interviews with prominent politicians, activists, and intellectuals for The Journal's \\"Weekend Interview\\" feature. Dispute with David French A high- profile dispute between Ahmari and National Review writer David French broke out over the summer of 2019 as a result of the publication of Ahmari's polemic \\"Against David French-ism\\", sparking numerous essays and commentaries in politically conservative publications like the National Review and The American Conservative, as well as in several politically liberal outlets like The New York Times, The New Yorker, and The Atlantic. The dispute first began on May 26, 2019, when Sohrab Ahmari expressed on Twitter his frustration with a Facebook advertisement for a children‚Äôs drag queen reading hour at a library in Sacramento, California, which he described as \\"transvestic fetishism\\", and argued that there is no \\"polite, David French-ian third way around the cultural civil war\\". This prompted a response from French in a May 28 essay published in the National Review entitled \\"Decency Is No Barrier to Justice or the Common Good\\". The dispute escalated significantly after Ahmari published the essay \\"Against David French-ism\\" in the conservative religious journal First Things on May 29, 2019. The direct targeting of French and the impromptu creation of the \\"David French-ism\\" political philosophy led the essay to gain a significant profile, prompting a response from French and the publication of numerous commentaries. On September 5, 2019, French and Ahmari engaged in an in-person political debate moderated by New York Times columnist Ross Douthat at the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C., again prompting a flurry of commentaries. The dispute centered around their differing opinions on how conservatives should approach cultural and political debate, with Ahmari deriding what he calls \\"David French-ism\\", a political persuasion he defines as believing \\"that the institutions of a technocratic market society are neutral zones that should, in theory, accommodate both traditional Christianity and the libertine ways and paganized ideology of the other side\\". He argues that this belief leads to an ineffective conservative movement, and contends that the best way for culturally conservative values to prevail in society is a strategy of \\"discrediting...opponents and weakening or destroying their institutions\\", which he maintains is a tactic already utilized by progressives, leaving conservatives who adhere to the David French-style of politics impotent in what he views as a waging culture war in the United States. He argues that the political realm should be viewed as one of \\"war and enmity\\", and that the power of the government should be directly utilized to impose culturally conservative values on society. French, by contrast, advocates a conservative libertarian approach in which decency, civility, and respect for individual rights are emphasized, and argues that Ahmari's beliefs \\"forsake\\" the philosophy of classical liberalism that the Founding Fathers of the United States espoused. He placed particular criticism on Ahmari's desire for direct government intervention in the lives of individuals, which he argues is not only antithetical to liberty but is a politically ruinous tactic for conservatives, who would end up on the receiving end of progressive policies if the government were given greater license to interfere in the private lives of individuals. Books While in law school, Ahmari co-edited with Nasser Weddady the 2012 book Arab Spring Dreams: The Next Generation Speaks Out for Freedom and Justice from North Africa to Iran, an anthology of the top essays submitted by young Middle Eastern dissidents to the Dream Deferred Essay Contest. The Times Literary Supplement writes that Weddady and Ahmari \\"perceptively edited this collection of winning entries\\" from the Dream Deferred contest, and that \\"some of these young writers [featured in the anthology] possess more clarity than all the pundits combined.\\" The book received endorsements from Polish Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and feminist icon Gloria Steinem, who wrote the anthology's foreword. Ahmari's book, The New Philistines, a polemic on how identity politics are corrupting the arts, was released on October 20, 2016 from Biteback Publishing. In January 2019, Ignatius Press published his spiritual memoir, From Fire, by Water, about his conversion to Roman Catholicism. Personal life Ahmari converted to Roman Catholicism from atheism in 2016. In late September 2016, he wrote a three-page article about his conversion in The Catholic Herald, which was the cover story of the September 30, 2016 issue.

He is credited with being the first person to circumnavigate the world on a motorcycle. Life Clancy was born in New Hampshire in 1890, the son of Alice Clancy from Massachusetts, and William Clancy, a 55-year-old Irishman. He became an advertising copy writer. In early October 1912, along with his biking partner, Walter Rendell Storey, he sailed from New York to Dublin, via Liverpool. His bike was a 934 cc 1912 Henderson Four motorcycle. The editor of The Irish Cyclist, Richard J. Mecredy (the inventor of bicycle polo) gave them road maps and helped them plot their route in Ireland. After covering the northern part of the country, they both got the ferry to Glasgow. Storey returned home from Paris, while Clancy continued his circumnavigation of the globe until August 1913. During the trip he rode 18,000 miles in Europe, Africa, Asia and North America. Clancy helped finance his trip by submitting details of his epic journey to Bicycling World and Motorcycle Review, a New York-based weekly magazine. Clancy produced or directed a number of Will Rogers movies starting with The Headless Horseman in 1922. In his later life, he moved to Virginia and made documentaries for the United States Forest Service. Centenary commemorative circumnavigation After reading the 2010 book MOTORCYCLE ADVENTURER by Dr. Gregory W. Frazier, two serious Irish adventurers decided to organize a global re-enactment of the Clancy record setting ride around the world. Feargal O‚ÄôNeill and his colleague Joe Walsh, in conjunction with the motorcycle traveller's website Horizons Unlimited, in 2011 announced the Clancy Centenary Ride for 2012‚Äì2013. According to O‚ÄôNeill, \\"I feel that there is a duty on us modern-day motorcyclists to do our bit to honour the memory of this great pioneer of our sport.\\" In 2013, Geoff Hill and Gary Walker recreated Clancy's ride, joined by Gregory W. Frazier and Richard Livermore for the North American transcontinental portion. Their travels were serialized by Hill in The Irish Times, and blogged on an Australian sponsor's website, and the American portion by Frazier in Motorcycle USA. Hill's travelogue In Clancy's Boots was published in 2013. Bibliography * Further reading Frazier, Dr. Gregory W.

Biography He was born on May 19, 1920 in West Orange, New Jersey as one of eight children of John Pasquale Renna Sr., a baker. He worked full-time as a bookkeeper and attended Rutgers University at night, earning a degree in accounting. In 1962, Renna sought a seat on the West Orange, New Jersey Township Council, but was unsuccessful. From 1970-1974, during the administration of Governor William Cahill, Renna served as Executive Director of the New Jersey Housing Finance Agency (HFA). The agency was accused of corruption during the period Renna was at its head, but Renna was never subpoenaed and maintained his innocence of any impropriety.Kean Names Aid Cited in Probe, The Courier-News (Bridgewater, New Jersey) 16 Jan 1982, page 14, accessed December 30, 2017 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16116442/kean_names_aid_cited_in_probe_the/ He also served as Essex County Purchasing Agent and was the longtime West Orange Republican Chairman. In 1977, Renna backed Raymond Bateman, a State Senator from Somerset County, for the Republican nomination for Governor. In that race, there were two Essex County candidates: former Assembly Speaker Thomas Kean and former State Senator C. Robert Sarcone. Although Kean carried Essex County, Bateman won the nomination. Renna immediately became a candidate for Essex County Republican Chairman (the incumbent, Frederic Remington, had won a GOP primary for Kean's State Assembly seat ). With the support of Bateman, who was leading in the polls, Renna defeated Assemblyman Carl Orechio of Nutley. Renna endorsed Kean for the gubernatorial nomination in 1981. Kean was one of five Essex County candidates seeking the GOP nomination, along with State Senator James Wallwork, Assemblyman Anthony Imperiale, former Superior Court Judge Richard McGlynn, and millionaire businessman Bo Sullivan. Kean won the nomination and the general election, and named Renna to his cabinet as Commissioner of Community Affairs. In that role, he also sat on the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, which controlled development in a large area in the state. Renna considered his greatest achievements in that role the enforcement of the boarding home regulations and a new fire safety code.Renna Will Leave State Post. Daily Record (Morristown, New Jersey) 10, Nov 1985, page 3, accessed December 30, 2017 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16120086/renna_will_leave_state_post_daily/ In 1985, Renna left the cabinet, and he became president of Great American Recreation, Inc. which operated the Vernon Valley-Great Gorge ski resort and the Action Park amusement park in Sussex County. In 1986, he was again elected Essex County Republican Chairman.Dillon, Mark, Ex-Kean Aides Doing Quite Well. Asbury Park Press (Asbury, New Jersey) 27 Jul 1986, page 15, accessed December 30, 2017 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16120203/ Renna had a few wins by watching the Democratic primary from the sidelines and then figuring out his ticket over the summer. That's what happened in 1986, when Essex County Executive Peter Shapiro's popularity plummeted‚Äîespecially among Democrats. Sensing an opportunity, Renna pulled his candidate, Carl Orechio, off the ticket and replaced him with Nicholas Amato, who had won three terms as Essex County Surrogate as a Democrat before Shapiro dumped him from the party line a few months earlier. For Surrogate, Renna ran another party switcher: Earl Harris, the Newark City Council President. The result was a GOP landslide. In 1988 he convinced Joe Louis Clark, the principal of Eastside High School in Paterson, New Jersey, and the subject of a semi-biographical film, Lean on Me, to run for Essex County Freeholder as a Republican. In a heavily Democratic district based in East Orange, Clark lost to LeRoy Jones. In 1994, Renna helped another Republican, James Treffinger, win election as Essex County Executive. But after Trefinger took office, he feuded with Renna and in 1996 engineered a coup to oust him. Renna died on August 21, 1998, four months after his wife, Grace Baldanza Renna.  John P.

It was filled with men from Marion County, Illinois, Washington County, Illinois, Clay County, Illinois, Wayne County, Illinois, and Clinton County, Illinois. They were organized at Salem, Illinois, and mustered into service on 18 September 1862, at Camp Marshall with 930 officers and men. They remained there for training until 31 October, then transported to Cairo, Illinois, on the Illinois Central Railroad, and thence to Columbus, Kentucky. Being attached to the Army of the Tennessee commanded by Major General Ulysses S. Grant. In December 1862 the 111th was attached to the XVI Corps under command of Major General Stephen A. Hurlbut. Their first assignment was guard duty at Columbus, Kentucky, to help ensure that new regiments and thousands of tons of supplies were safe from Confederate raiders. In March 1863, the regiment was ordered to Fort Heiman, Kentucky, across the Tennessee River from Fort Henry, which had been captured by Grant's troops thirteen months previous. At the end of May they were transferred to Paducah, Kentucky, again guarding supplies. They remained there until the end of October when the regiment was finally ordered into active campaigning. In November they participated in the occupation of Decatur, Alabama. As General William T. Sherman was preparing for his advance on Atlanta, Georgia, the 111th was attached to the XV Corps under General John A. Logan. In early May they advanced into northern Georgia with the rest of Sherman's army and saw fighting at the Battle of Resaca on 14 May. Seeing Rebels advancing obliquely in their front, the regiment charged and turned back the enemy advance. This was the first major battle the 111th took part in after a year and a half in the army, and although they were rookies to combat they stood and performed like the veterans that they were, suffering seven men killed and twenty-eight wounded. General Logan personally complimented the regiment for their quick action. They took part in the Battle of Dallas during the last several days of May losing five men killed and fifteen wounded. Advancing further southward, they were lightly engaged in the Battle of New Hope Church and then took a position in front of Kennesaw Mountain in mid-June. On 27 June the advanced and participated in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. Their attack, like most of the other Union attacks, was bloodily repulsed by Confederates who were in heavily fortified earthworks. The continued to skirmish around Kennesaw Mountain and Marietta, Georgia, for nearly a month before advancing on Atlanta. On 22 July it seemed as though the Confederates had abandoned their trenches in front of the city, so the 111th was part of the force sent out to determine the enemy's location. After advancing near the enemy works they threw up breastworks and hoped to be the first regiment to advance into Atlanta. At about noon musketry was heard to their left and soon a division of Confederates came crashing down on the 111th. The regiment tried to hold back the enemy, but their vastly superior numbers soon forced the men to retreat. Being nearly surrounded they had to cut their way back to the rear. Their entire division had been crushed and those who were not killed or captured sped to the rear. General Logan personally rallied the men and organized a counter-attack to take back the trenches that had been lost. By nightfall, the 111th had reoccupied their entrenchments and the Union army had succeeded in turning back Hood's assault. During the Battle of Atlanta the regiment lost twenty killed, forty-five wounded, and eighty missing/captured. It was the bloodiest day in the regiment's service. Continuing to serve in the trenches around Atlanta and fought at the Battle of Jonesborough. After the city fell into Union hands on 2 September, the regiment served as part of the occupation force. From November to December they participated in the March to the Sea and besieged Savannah, Georgia. Then they embarked on the Carolinas Campaign at the end of January 1865 and participated in the capture of Columbia, South Carolina, on 17 February. As the army advanced into South Carolina they met with no serious resistance but continually skirmished with militia and scattered Confederate forces. In North Carolina they were lightly engaged in the Battle of Bentonville on 10 March and were present at Durham Station, North Carolina, when Joseph E. Johnston surrendered the troops under his command. With the rest of Sherman's army, they marched northward through the former Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, and encamped outside Washington, D.C. on 19 May. Five days later the 111th participated in the Grand Review of the Armies. The 111th Illinois remained in Washington City until 7 June when they were mustered out of Federal service. On 10 June they traveled by rail to Springfield, Illinois, and were at Camp Butler until they received final pay and discharge on 27 June 1865.

Lawrence moved from New Jersey to Palmyra, New York, with sister Fanny and her husband Abner Cole. Lawrence and Smith reportedly engaged in \\"money-digging\\" (or treasure hunting). Later Lawrence moved to Oswego, New York, where he died. Early life Lawrence was born in New Jersey to Sylvanus and Jemima Lawrence. He had an older brother, Daniel, and an adopted sister, Frances \\"Fanny\\" Wickham Darling, a biological first cousin who was adopted into the family and took the last name Lawrence. By 1811, Lawrence and Rachel Bryant (born 1793) were married, and the two had at least one daughter, Frances Maria. In Palmyra Around 1820, Lawrence and his family moved to Palmyra. Samuel's sister Fanny and her husband Abner Cole had resided in Palmyra since 1812. In Palmyra, Lawrence developed a reputation as a seer and a treasure-hunter. Lawrence was part of a company of \\"money- diggers\\" that included Joseph Smith, Sr., Joseph Smith, Jr., Hyrum Smith, George Proper, Josiah Stowell, and Alva Beaman. Martin Harris, a witness to the Book of Mormon's golden plates, later recalled a tale of an encounter between the money-diggers and a \\"treasure guardian\\": :\\"Samuel Lawrence told me that while they were digging, a large man who appeared to be eight or nine feet high, came and sat on the ridge of the barn, and motioned to them that they must leave. They motioned back that they would not; but that they afterwards became frightened and did leave.\\" Another resident, Joseph Capron, recalled when the company \\"discovered\\" a chest of gold watches, but they were \\"in the possession of the evil spirit\\". Lawrence, reportedly \\"with a drawn sword in his hand, marched around to guard any assault which his Satanic majesty might be disposed to make.\\" The dig ended without success. According to one account, Lawrence traveled with Smith to Harmony, Pennsylvania, to search for a silver mine, during which Lawrence recommended Smith to Emma Hale, Smith's future wife. Lawrence and the golden plates Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, claimed the Book of Mormon was a translation of golden plates which Smith had been guided to by an angel. Lawrence figures in some of the discovery narratives of the golden plates. Willard Chase recalled in 1833 that Smith had been told by a spirit \\"to come again, in just one year, and bring a man with him\\". According to Chase, Smith at one point \\"believed that one Samuel T. Lawrence was the man alluded to by the spirit\\" and reportedly took Lawrence \\"to a singular looking hill, in Manchester, and showed him where the treasure was.\\" According to the account, Smith later changed his mind and decided Lawrence was not the \\"right man\\". Joseph Knight, Sr. recalled that \\"Joseph was some afraid of Samuel Lawrence that he might be a trouble to him.\\" Therefore, prior to retrieving the golden plates on September 22, 1827, Smith sent his father to Lawrence's residence \\"to see if there was any signs of his going away that night.\\" In her 1853 book, Lucy Mack Smith recalled her husband's visit to the Lawrence house, writing that \\"he could overhear their conversation\\" and they were \\"devising many plans and schemes to find 'Joe Smith's gold bible'.\\" Reportedly, Lawrence's wife warned her husband \\"'Sam, Sam,' said she. 'You are cutting your own throat.' At this, the conjuror bawled out at the top of his voice, 'I am not afraid of anybody. We will have the plates in spite of Joe Smith or all the devils in hell.'\\" Later life In May 1830, Lawrence was operating the Palmyra Bathing House, and served as a subscription collector for his brother-in-law's paper the Liberal Advocate. On April 17, 1833, Lawrence was indicted for \\"fraudulently secreting property\\". Lawrence and his brother Daniel moved with their families to Oswego, New York by the autumn of 1833.

He was of old Bavarian stock, a member of the Aribonid and Sighardinger kin groups, whose members had at times held the bishopric of Freising in the past. Pilgrim was already a clergyman when in 889 King Arnulf of Germany granted him a large forest, the Zillertal, which remained under the lordship of the rulers of Salzburg until 1810. Pilgrim maintained good relations with the Carolingian ruling house. When Theotmar, archbishop of Salzburg, died during the battle of Pressburg in July 907, Pilgrim was appointed to succeed him on 7 September. He was consecrated by 22 October. He probably owed his appointment during such a crisis to his closeness to the royal court. The Hungarian victory at Pressburg, however, meant the loss for Salzburg of its primary mission field. For this, Pilgrim obtained compensation in the form of royal grants. In 908, Pilgrim received from King Louis IV the royal curtis of Salzburghofen with all its appurtenances, which included the dominant position in the old saltworks at Reichenhall. The nuns of the convent at Altm√ºnster, who probably been forced to abandon the place by the incoming Hungarians, likewise came under the joint protection of Pilgrim, Margrave Aribo of Austria and King Louis. In 911, the newly-elected Conrad I, the first non-Carolingian German king, appointed Pilgrim the archchaplain and archchancellor of his court. In September 916, Pilgrim attended the synod of the entire kingdom at Hohenaltheim. There it was decided by the bishops to support the king and condemn the rebellions of Duke Arnulf of Bavaria and Duke Erchanger of Swabia. It was also decided to bring the German church close to the Papacy. Consequently, Arnulf went into exile in Hungary and Pilgrim took charge of Bavaria in his absence. Arnulf returned following Conrad's death in 918 and the Bavarian nobility apparently elected him king in opposition to Conrad's successor, Henry I. In 921 Henry and Arnulf came to an agreement, whereby the former recognised the latter's autonomy within Bavaria in return for his recognition as king. Henry admitted Arnulf's right to appoint bishops, which greatly reduced Pilgrim's status. He was no longer royal archchaplain whose political influence was kingdom-wide and was reduced to the metropolitan of a distinctly Bavarian church.

Biography Saltzman was born on October 1, 1916, in Brooklyn, New York, to a Russian immigrant father, Isidore, and his wife Dora. It was a Jewish family and he had two sisters. He attended Samuel J. Tilden High School. He graduated from Columbia University in 1936, at the age of 19 or 20, majoring in economics and government. While there he earned a top-level award for his performance on the Debate Council. He married his wife, the former Joan Roth, in a Jewish ceremony on November 21, 1942. They raised three children, born between 1945 and 1951. They went on to live in Sands Point, New York. His first job was taken in 1936 with the Premiere Knitting Company, the family sweater business. He then entered government service, working for the Roosevelt administration as a member of the National Industrial Mobilization Committee. He was in charge of the Military Price Control Section of the Office of Price Administration, with $8 billion of defense and Lend-Lease spending under his purview. He was on the Procurement Policy Board, which had representatives from each large government agency. By 1944 he was an ensign in the United States Coast Guard. During the Korean War, he served in the Office of Price Stabilization. Saltzman returned to business, becoming vice president and then president of Premiere Knitting. He became vice president and a director of Botany Industries (an outgrowth of Botany Mills) from 1959 to 1962. Saltzman was president of the Seagrave Corporation starting in 1961. He took a company that mostly made fire-fighting equipment and diversified it via acquisition and other changes into one that did leather processing, made paint and industrial finishes, constructed low-cost houses, and sold mortgages. He remained president of Seagrave into the 1970s. A lifelong Democrat, Saltzman served five U.S. presidents as envoys on diplomatic missions. He was a trouble-shooter for the U.S. Department of State during the Kennedy administration and Johnson administration years. He helped negotiate the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the mid-late 1960s. He was a hopeful for the Democratic nomination in the United States Senate election in New York, 1974. But he had little support in the New York State Democratic Committee, and instead he was chosen as an unsalaried advisor to New York State's Congressional delegation as it tried to heal internal divisions. In 1976, he served as chair of the federal Advisory Committee on National Growth Policy Processes; it published a report entitled Forging America's Future: Strategies for National Growth and Development. He was co- author of the 1990 book Bending with the Winds: Kurt Waldheim and the United Nations. In its review, Foreign Affairs magazine said that the book's examination of Kurt Waldheim's career was \\"meticulously undertaken\\" and that its recommendations for how the Secretary-General of the United Nations could better be chosen \\"[make] the book important today\\". Still in business, Saltzman headed Vista Resources (which Seagrave had become), a diversified public company, until selling majority interest in it in 1989. He became chair of the Windsor Production Corporation, a privately held oil, real estate, and investment firm. In 1992, he was named by Kyrgyzstan, newly independent of the Soviet Union, as its representative in negotiations for natural-resource arrangements with American companies. In 1993, Saltzman pleaded guilty in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to charges of insurance fraud related to a $610,000 claim before Chubb Insurance on behalf of a leather products company. By 2001, there had still been no sentencing hearing in his case, a delay that legal experts said was extraordinary. In 2002, having previously made financial restitution, Saltzman attempted to withdraw that felony plea, have it expunged, and substitute a misdemeanor plea instead, but a federal judge denied the request. In 2003, Columbia University's Institute of War and Peace Studies was renamed the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies. Two endowed chairs under the Saltzman name were also added at that time. Saltzman later said, \\"Anything that can fight war and promote peace I'm for!\\" As a benefactor, Saltzman and his wife played a part in the creation of the Joan and Arnold Saltzman Community Services Center at Hofstra University, where he was a trustee emeritus. The center provides health services both to Hofstra and the local community and additionally provides educational and practitioner experience for Hofstra students. He was founding president of the Nassau County Museum of Art and the couple are reflected in the name of the Arnold and Joan Saltzman Fine Arts Building there, where he became chairman emeritus. It was given this name following a large-scale renovation of the central building on the museum. In 2012, Saltzman was the originating force behind bringing a world-class Marc Chagall exhibit to the museum. Saltzman also served as a trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art and was involved with acquisitions for the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 2012, the library in Port Washington, New York, named its reading room after the couple following a large gift from the Saltzman Foundation. Saltzman died on January 2, 2014, at his home in Sands Point, New York. Also see Awards and honors Saltzman was given honorary degrees by Adelphi University in 1985 and Hofstra University in 1986. In 2002, Saltzman was presented with the Order of Honor from the Republic of Georgia, \\"in recognition of his notable personal contribution to the implementation of international aid programs [and] his active support of Georgia's interest and generous charity work\\".

He took an early retirement and moved to Australia. Bennett was born in Wales, served with the British signals intelligence organization GCHQ during World War II. According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations, Bennett met Kim Philby during World War II, when they were both stationed in Turkey. While living in Australia in 1950 Bennett married an Australian woman. Later that year he and his wife moved to Canada when he began his 22-year employment as a civilian employee of the RCMP According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations in 1962 the Central Intelligence Agency's chief of counter- intelligence James Jesus Angleton trusted Bennett to interview a key Soviet defector Anatol Golitsyn. However, Angleton, who was known for being highly suspicious, began to suspect that Bennett might himself be a mole. Angleton opened a dossier on Bennett in 1967. By 1970 Angleton's suspicions grew to the point the RCMP had to conduct an investigation into Bennett. They put him under surveillance, tapped his phone, and bugged his house‚Äîincluding his bedroom. This operation, codenamed \\"Operation Gridiron\\" culminated in taking Bennett to a safehouse for a humiliating five-day interrogation. During his interrogation his interrogators asked Bennett embarrassing personal questions about his sex life based on comments captured from the bug in his bedroom. The investigation did not find any evidence that Bennett was a double agent, but his clearance to have access to top secret information was withdrawn, to satisfy American concerns. According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations, when Angleton was removed in 1974, it turned out he never had any real evidence Bennett had ever been disloyal. After he left the RCMP his wife left him, and returned to Australia with their two daughters. The Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations asserted that he was only able to get menial work. In 1977 Ian Adams published a short novel entitled S: Portrait of a Spy, about a senior RCMP security official who was a mole. Other commentators would assert that many of the novel's character seemed to be thinly veiled descriptions of real individuals‚Äîstarting with \\"S\\", the titular character, who Paul Hellyer and Peter Worthington would identify as Bennett. Worthington contacted Bennett, strongly encouraging him to sue Adams. During the civil suit the judge required Adams to name his sources, but allowed Bennett to refuse to testify on the grounds that doing so might reveal secrets that would put national security at risk. Adams and Bennett reached an out of court settlement. Bennett was paid $30,000‚Äîreported to be barely enough to pay his legal expenses. In 1982 John Sawatsky published For Services Rendered: Leslie James Bennett and the RCMP Security Service, which he presented as a more thorough, professional examination of Bennett's career. In 1985 another Soviet defector, Vitali Sergeyevich Yurchenko confirmed there was a Soviet mole in the RCMP, but identified him as another official. According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations the actual mole was Sergeant Gilles G. Brunet. In 1993 The Fifth Estate, an investigative journalism television program from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, profiled Bennett, and interviewed a former KGB director of foreign counter- intelligence, General Oleg Kalugin, who also confirmed another RCMP official was the mole, and that he had never heard of Bennett. The Fifth Estate also identified the mole as Gilles G. Brunet. According to Dan Mulvenna, a colleague of Bennett, in 1993, after The Fifth Estate profiled Bennett, the then Solicitor General \\"exonerated\\" Bennett, and he was given a $100,000 payment. Bennett had been a civilian employee of the RCMP, he was not officially a Mountie, but, according to Mulvenna, due to his long service and the respect felt for him, the organization of retired Mounties made him an honorary member.

The Monk of Salzburg lived there for a time, if indeed they are not one and the same person. A scion of the Austrian noble Lords of Puchheim, Pilgrim first appears as a canon of Salzburg Cathedral in 1353. He was ordained in Venice in 1354 before moving to Avignon, where he received his education. In 1363 he was appointed to a papal chaplaincy, the papacy being at the time seated at Avignon. He was appointed archbishop of Salzburg in 1365, backed by the Habsburg dukes of Austria against strong Bavarian resistance. Pilgrim nevertheless was able to free himself from ties and dependencies; he was so powerful that by 1393 he had endowed his cathedral more than one hundred times. In 1381 he obtained the privilegium de non evocando, confirming his status as a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. The Monk of Salzburg claims in two of his songs that he wrote them at Pilgrim's command. In another piece, the lines form an acrostic that reads \\"Pylgreim Erczpischof Legat\\". In a secular song of 1387 Pilgrim's visit to the court of King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia is mentioned, and his travels are also recounted in a secular song from 1392.

Looking from the distance, those color compositions, abstractly displayed with randomness in flow, deliver a vivid image of objects depicted by the artist. Jin plays humorously with space and time to trigger a new way to see oil painting. Noted that, his works, Color Movement Series, conveys strongly a sense of surrealism and romanticism; melody from the heart is sung by the artist's interpretation of impermanence in nature and in life, and resemble in some way works by Nicolas de Sta√´l, a painter known for his use of a thick impasto and his highly abstract landscape painting; Jing's formation of structure may be associated with Serge Poliakoff.

Operations were expected to begin in select cities starting late 2019; however, as of July 2020, the service has yet to materialize.Look, up in the sky! It's my package. Amazon to start drone delivery 'within months' The service uses delivery drones to autonomously fly individual packages to customers within 30 minutes of ordering. To qualify for 30-minute delivery, the order must be less than 5 pounds (2.25 kg), must be small enough to fit in the cargo box that the craft will carry, and must have a delivery location within a 10-mile (16 km) radius of a participating Amazon order fulfillment center. History Concept In 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos revealed plans for Amazon Prime Air in an interview on 60 Minutes. The Amazon Prime Air team worked with NASA and Single European Sky ATM on trials using the Amazon air traffic management system. For additional safety, drones will fly at low altitudes (below 400 feet). There are no roads or fixed routes so there are many more options to get from point A to point B, that is why navigating a drone through the air is very different than a car driving on a road. Amazon claims their traffic management system is easy to use for various operators in the same airspace because it will connect via the internet.  United States regulations and testing under waiver program In the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Congress issued the Federal Aviation Administration a deadline of September 30, 2015 to accomplish a \\"safe integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system.\\" In August 2016 commercial use of UAV technology was legalized by the United States Congress. In March 2015, the FAA granted Amazon permission to begin U.S. testing of a prototype under a waiver to the then regulations. Amazon reported that the vehicle cleared for use was obsolete. In April 2015, the FAA allowed Amazon to begin testing current models. In the interim, Amazon had begun testing at a Canadian site close to the United States border. Current U.S. regulations required drones fly no higher than 400 ft (122 m), no faster than 100 mph (161 km/h), and remain within the pilot's line of sight.Zwickle, Adam, Hillary B. Farber, and Joseph A. Hamm. 2018. \\"Comparing Public Concern and Support for Drone Regulation to the Current Legal Framework.\\" Behavioral Sciences & the Law37(1):109‚Äì24. Retrieved March 18, 2019 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bsl.2357). Amazon has stated it intends to move towards operating above 200 ft (61 m) and beneath 500 ft (152 m). Amazon has stated it plans to fly drones weighing up to 55 lb (25 kg) within a 10 mi (16 km) radius of its warehouses, at speeds of up to 50 mph (80.5 km/h) with packages weighing up to 5 lb (2.26 kg) in tow.  Delivery deployment development  Amazon has patented a beehive-like structure to house delivery drones in cities, allowing Amazon to move from large single- story warehouses that temporarily store packages before they are shipped. Fulfillment centres designed to accommodate drone deliveries and operations within a certain radius are currently required. This was announced in a video released by Amazon. On December 15, 2016, Amazon began its first publicly available trial of Amazon Prime Air to those within several miles of Amazon's depot in Cambridge, England. First deliveries On December 7, 2016, Amazon successfully delivered a Prime Air parcel to Cambridge, England. Amazon had built a Prime Air fulfillment center in the Cambridge area. Amazon posted a video of the delivery on their official YouTube channel, on December 14, 2016.  Internet connection and information storage  Amazon Prime Air drones will be connected to the internet for flight control management, and communication between drones. It has been reported by Brookings that Amazon's data collection usage from drones has not been disclosed. The Pittsburgh Journal of Technology Law and Policy, have reported proposed data collection from Amazon Prime Air drones as including; automated object detection, GPS surveillance, gigapixel cameras, and enhanced image resolution.  Self- driving cars  Autonomous vehicles also fall under the Prime Air division's responsibility. While the last mile of a delivery is the most expensive and human drivers are the primary cost there is limited news about autonomous road vehicle deliveries. Amazon was granted a patent for reversible lanes in 2017.

Typical crew is a helmsman and two deck hands in trapezes. The boat is predominately used for racing.  History  B&R; 23 was designed by Lars Bergstr√∂m, Sven-Olov Ridder and Torkel Stillefors. The idea came from Stillefors, who had been involved in the sail racing circles of New Zealand while living there in the early 1980s. During his time in New Zealand, Stillefors was inspired by the high performance extreme dinghies and ultra light displacement sport boats there. In addition, the 18ft skiffs in Sydney Harbour were a source of inspiration, and soon Stillefors started contemplate building something similar that could offer similar performance and thrills. Back in Sweden Stillefors got in contact with Lars Bergstr√∂m and Sven-Olof Ridder, at the time a famous Swedish inventor/design duo, who became interested in Stillefors‚Äô ideas for a new high performance sportsboat. This led them to taking part in the design of a new boat, the B&R; 23\\\\. Bergstr√∂m designed the hull and sail plan at his design office in Sarasota Florida, resulting in a computer printed line drawing, a design technique that was not common practice in those early days of computer- aided design. Ridder focused on the design of the hydrodynamic detail. Ridder, working as Professor at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, had previously built scaled models, very similar to the B&R; 23, and performed dynamic tank testing on them to verify the hydrodynamic characteristics of the design. At his residence in Stockholm he designed the 32-degree swept back retractable keel and the rudder. Stillefors took charge of the superstructure, deck layout and equipment design. In 1993 the first B&R; 23 was built at Bergsviksvarvet in Stockholm by Stillefors, and soon the sailors on Lake M√§laren saw a futuristic fast boat with two deck hands on wire swishing past them with water spraying around the bow.  Design philosophy  The B&R; 23 is designed with a single guiding principle: it should be very fast. No considerations were given to any performance limiting handicap or yardstick rules, or other secondary parameters, such as comfort or ease-of-handling. Thus, the philosophy behind B&R; 23‚Äôs design can be said having been ‚Äúno- holds-barred‚Äù, that is, a ruthless focus on raw performance. This resulted in an extremely light (420 kg/926 lbs), minimum resistance, high performance apparent wind boat with a huge sail plane, particularly for downwind, where the total sail area is close to 100 m2 (1,000 sqft). The boat is capable of planing in modest winds downwind, and even on upwind the boat performs very well, in parity with much bigger 38‚Äì40 foot yachts. For the hull, Bergstr√∂m was strongly influenced by Hunter‚Äôs Child, an Open 60 ultra light weight design, which was built in the early 1990s and raced in the 1994-1995 BOC Challenge. The B&R; 23 is equipped with the patented B&R; rig. The main characteristics of the rig include: * two rigid struts supporting the lower section of the mast * no backstays * 30 degree swept spreaders * double diamond shrouding Benefits of the B&R; rig are: * decreased load of mast foot - load spread over three points, allows for smaller mast section, decreasing weight * increased strength of rig * the loading of the mast, shrouds and mast foot is decreased * allows for a large leach in mainsail The B&R; 23 sports a 5 ft rotating bowsprit which allows the Asymmetrical spinnaker being rotated laterally 30 degrees to windward, to avoid blanketing behind the jib when sailing deeper angles. It also features a system with two trapezes to maximize the righting moment that the crew can assert on the boat to keep it level. The retractable keel is operated with a tackle attached to the mast. The most recently built boat is equipped with a deeper and heavier keel (for even better upwind performance) and a carbon fiber mast (to lower center of gravity). The first generation of boats can be retrofitted with these improvements.  Characteristics  The boat has almost no form stability: walking on the gunwale, the boat immediately heels over. There is not much weight stability either, the 90 kg‚Äôs of the ‚Äòkeel‚Äô does not provide enough momentum to keep the boat upright, even without any wind pressure in the sail plane. In this respect the boat is much more of a dinghy than a keel boat. On water under sail, the boat must be kept upright by active crew work, balancing, hiking, steering and constant adjustment of the power of the sails. The B&R; 23 is very agile, reacting immediately to the tiniest changes in conditions, demanding a high level of alertness and very proactive sailing by the crew, who must be fully synchronised in all their actions on board. Upwind, the boat is able to plane under ideal conditions, however, the best point of sail for a B&R; 23 is downwind. Being an apparent wind boat, it will rarely if ever be sailed directly downwind, instead, optimum downwind performance is achieved by gybing downwind while reaching somewhere around 150 degrees TWA, which typically results in AWA‚Äôs forward of beam. In most conditions, boat speed will easily exceed wind speed, and in favorable conditions, getting close to factor 2. As soon as the wind exceeds light breeze, the boat must be steered for balance by agile crew work and tiller work by the helmsman. It is not possible to ‚Äòforce‚Äô the boat doing anything it doesn‚Äôt want to. In a moderate breeze, under downwind, there must always be room to bear off - should a gust suddenly hit, the only option to keep the boat from capsizing is to bear off. This makes overtaking close to windward of another boat interesting. The very large sail area demands constant control of the power generated by the sails. As soon as the breeze increases, wind must be spilled to maintain balance. The B&R; 23 is kept upright and steered not only by rudder, but by the combination of TWA, balancing, sail trim as well as rudder. The performance of the boat is exceptional as attested by the Life on the Layline Action Index.Action Index, lifeonthelayline.com The B&R; 23 scores very high, close to the most extreme multihulls.

The area is semi-rural and there are no schools; most children attend schools in nearby Lower Hutt, and Primary School zoning is for Korokoro. The only feature other than houses and farms is Horokiwi Quarry. Access and roads The only access to Horokiwi is via Horokiwi Road, a road that climbs up a hill and branches off the Petone- Wellington motorway. There are only five streets/roads; Horokiwi Road, Hillcroft Road, Lincolnshire Road, Woollaston Way and Van Der Velden Way. The former runs for approximately 6.5km, and the final kilometer eventually reaches Belmont Regional Park and becomes much more narrow. It also provides scenic views of Lower Hutt, Wellington Harbour, and other northern suburbs of Wellington such as Tawa and Grenada North. Since 2010 the only access to Horokiwi is from the northbound lane of the State Highway (SH1), causing around 8km detours for residents traveling from North. The Caribbean Avenue Reserve can be accessed from Horokiwi Road. Earliest history of Horokiwi The Horokiwi/Korokoro area has historically been used for travel between the Hutt Valley and Porirua. European settlers in the district in the early part of the 19th century travelled for the most part on well-used old Maori tracks. In the 1880s, prominent Wellington settler James Coutts Crawford wrote about his journey from the Kapiti Coast to Port Nicholson following his arrival in New Zealand in late 1839: \\"Passing Titahi Bay, and the pretty shores of Porirua, we entered the main bush, and travelled up the stream, in a line with whose course the present road stretches. We crossed and recrossed the stream about seventy times, until at length the path ascended and led us over the summit of the range overlooking Korokoro. The whole distance traversed, with the exception of some few patches of cultivation at Porirua, was through dense and uncleared forest. The Hutt Valley presented a dense forest of gigantic trees, and a large pa was visible at Pitone. As we descended the hill, our advance was hindered by a mass of newly-felled forest, which was cleared and ready for burning off. Our escort now commenced firing guns to attract the attention of the fishermen; and as we descended the hill the canoes approached the shore, so that when we reached it, they were there to meet us\\" (Coutts 1880: pp 27-28). Elsdon Best also reports that many of the first journeys by Europeans through the district were made using 'old Maori trails', the main one running over the hills from the Korokoro Stream to Tawa Flat and on to Porirua. Best describes the Korokoro track as beginning on the south side of the Korokoro Stream, close to the mouth. It then ascended through bush up a steep hill and followed the ridge line to the Takapu Valley to the Kenepuru Stream and on to Porirua. After the Petone settlement was removed and relocated to its current site of Wellington City, the track from Kaiwharawhara across Paerau hill was used more. This track joined with the Korokoro track at Takapu and then carried on to Porirua.

The game featured the No. 1-ranked and two-time defending national champion Alabama Crimson Tide (11‚Äì0, 7‚Äì0 in the SEC) as a 10-point favorite over the No. 4-ranked Auburn Tigers (10‚Äì1, 6‚Äì1 in the SEC). The Iron Bowl was fiercely contested in 2013 with both teams ranked in the top 5 and a berth in the 2013 SEC Championship Game and, potentially, the national championship game at stake. However, this game was particularly notable for its ending. After falling behind in the 2nd quarter and then again in the 4th, Auburn rallied late to tie the game at 28‚Äì28 with 32 seconds remaining. After the ensuing kickoff, Alabama quickly moved to the Auburn 38 yard line, at which point the clock ran out, seemingly sending the game to overtime. Alabama coach Nick Saban challenged the timekeeping call, and after a video review, one second was put back on the clock, and the Crimson Tide lined up for a potential game winning 57-yard field goal. The kick was short, and Auburn's Chris Davis, who had been positioned near the goal line, caught the ball just in front of the goal posts. Davis ran across the entire field through players from both teams to the opposite end zone, improbably scoring the winning touchdown for Auburn on the last play of the game. Though the runback was technically about 109 yards, it is officially considered a 100-yard return according to NCAA rules, and it tied LSU's Odell Beckham Jr.'s record-setting 100 yard return that same season. The game, which was televised by CBS, posted an 11.8 television rating during the final half-hour, which was the highest rating ever achieved during a college football broadcast at that time. Some sportswriters have argued that Davis' return is the single greatest moment in college football history.  Background  Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium, where the 78th Iron Bowl was played The two teams came into the game after very different 2012 seasons. Despite an upset at the hands of Texas A&M;, the Crimson Tide ultimately finished as SEC Champions after a close game against the Georgia Bulldogs and went on to soundly defeat Notre Dame 42‚Äì14 for their second consecutive national title, their third in four years. Meanwhile, two years after their own National Championship, the Auburn Tigers suffered through their worst season in 60 years, finishing 3‚Äì9 with an abysmal 0‚Äì8 SEC record, capped by a 49‚Äì0 loss to Alabama in the 2012 Iron Bowl‚Äìtheir second consecutive blowout loss on the Iron Bowl. Head coach Gene Chizik was fired in favor of Arkansas State coach and former Auburn offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn. Alabama entered the season ranked #1 and remained at the top of the polls for the entire season, rolling through their schedule with relative ease; they won all but one of their games by more than 10 points. Auburn, on the other hand, entered the season unranked and did not enter the AP Poll until the midpoint of the season. Auburn's season was defined by a series of come-from-behind wins and miraculous plays. Auburn defeated Mississippi State in September on a late touchdown pass. The following month, No. 24 Auburn came from behind to beat No. 7 Texas A&M; and Johnny Manziel. With that win, Auburn surged all the way to No. 11 in both major polls. Two weeks before the Iron Bowl, No. 7 Auburn defeated rival Georgia with a miraculous tipped Hail Mary pass known as the \\"Prayer at Jordan‚ÄìHare\\", setting the stage for a highly ranked Iron Bowl matchup. Alabama was predicted by analysts to conclude the 2013‚Äì14 season with a BCS record third straight national title, their fourth in five years. The winner of the previous four Iron Bowls (2009‚Äì2012) went on to win the national championship: Alabama in 2009, 2011, and 2012; and Auburn in 2010. Entering the 2013 Iron Bowl, with Alabama and Auburn ranked No. 1 and No. 4 respectively in the BCS standings, this was only the second matchup in the rivalry to feature two Top 5 teams, and the highest-ranked Iron Bowl ever. On November 27, 1971, No. 3 Alabama faced No. 5 Auburn at Legion Field in Birmingham, both teams undefeated. Alabama was also undefeated in the last three years and 24 days in games played outside of their home field in Tuscaloosa, their last loss prior to those 18 consecutive road victories coming on November 6, 2010 at LSU. With Alabama favored by 10 points, Auburn was a decided underdog in the eyes of most analysts. Marq Burnett of The Anniston Star went as far as to list seven reasons why Auburn could not beat Alabama including Alabama's tough run defense and unstoppable offense, even the superior coaching skills of Nick Saban over Gus Malzahn. Joel Erickson of The Birmingham News was one of the few writers to pick Auburn, predicting a score of 31‚Äì28. Similar predictions were shared during ESPN's College GameDay, which was broadcast live from outside Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium prior to the game. The program's panel of Kirk Herbstreit, David Pollack, and Lee Corso, as well as Paul Finebaum, unanimously picked Alabama to win the game. Auburn alumnus and NBA on TNT personality Charles Barkley, who appeared as a special guest, went against the panel and chose Auburn to win the game.

Auburn's opening drive netted 20 yards and no points. Alabama was then held to seven yards, going three-and-out. Auburn then capped off a seven-play, 66-yard drive with a 45-yard touchdown run by Nick Marshall. It was the Tigers' first offensive touchdown against Alabama since 2010. The quarter ended with Auburn leading 7‚Äì0. Second quarter Alabama scored touchdowns on their first three possessions of the second quarter, with the first two on scoring passes by AJ McCarron; the first was a 67-yard drive, the second was 36 yards, and the third drive covered 56 yards. Alabama had scored 21 unanswered points. But Auburn scored late in the second quarter on a Tre Mason run, and the Crimson Tide led, 21‚Äì14, at the half. Third quarter Under Saban, Alabama had a record of 73‚Äì3 when leading at halftime. Auburn received the kickoff in the second half and drove 69 yards to tie the game, 21‚Äì21. Later in the quarter Alabama drove 88 yards to Auburn's 11 before the 3rd quarter came to a close. Fourth quarter Alabama's drive came to a halt following two incomplete passes, and a false start penalty that moved the offense back five yards, nullifying the first successful field goal attempt of the game. The Crimson Tide then missed their second field goal of the game. Later in the quarter an Auburn punt was downed at the Alabama 1-yard line. McCarron then threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper, giving Alabama a 28‚Äì21 lead with 10:28 remaining in the game. It was the longest pass play in Crimson Tide football history. With 2:41 left in the game, and trailing 28‚Äì21, Auburn drove to the Alabama 39 in six plays. =Final 32 seconds= With 32 seconds remaining, the Tigers scored on a 39-yard touchdown pass from Marshall to Sammie Coates. On the ensuing possession, with seven seconds left in the game, Alabama ran to Auburn's 38-yard line as T. J. Yeldon was knocked out of bounds by Chris Davis while the game clock expired. But Saban argued that Yeldon had stepped out of bounds with one second left in regulation. Saban's argument was validated by the instant replay officials, who put one second back on the clock. Rather than take a knee and go to overtime, Alabama attempted to win the game with a 57-yard field goal and Auburn took a timeout. Auburn's defensive coordinator, Ellis Johnson, doubted Alabama would make the long field goal and suggested that a defensive back stand in the end zone with the potential to return a missed field goal. Malzahn then put Davis, who doubled as Auburn's punt returner, in the end zone for the return in the event of a miss. As the field goal attempt fell short, Davis fielded the ball nine yards deep in the end zone and ran down the sideline. With Alabama's field goal unit being made up mostly of offensive linemen, Davis ran all the way to the end zone to win the game 34‚Äì28. It was unofficially the longest missed field goal return in NCAA history, tying a 109-yard return earlier in the 2013 season by Odell Beckham of LSU. However, he was only credited with 100 yards; unlike the NFL, the NCAA does not count yardage inside the end zone for kick returns. The crowd reaction registered on seismographs across the state of Alabama, in a manner similar to activity registered during the 1988 Auburn‚ÄìLSU \\"Earthquake Game\\".Iron Bowl Earthquake?

In the postseason, Alabama lost to the Oklahoma Sooners, 45‚Äì31, in the 2014 Sugar Bowl. Pat Forde, then a columnist for Yahoo Sports, stated: > It was, quite simply, the most astounding ending ever to a college football > game. I was at the Boise State‚ÄìOklahoma Fiesta Bowl in 2007; this tops it. > More at stake, and even more shock value on the final play (minus the player > proposing to his girlfriend on the field). An article in USA Today described the back-to-back victories with the analogy that lightning struck twice, the Georgia game being \\"one of the greatest finishes to a college football game\\" and the Alabama upset \\"perhaps the greatest play in college football history\\". The Birmingham News called the Auburn victory their \\"latest miracle finish ... even more stunning than the first.\\" The News & Record called the 2013 Iron Bowl possibly \\"the greatest college football game ever played.\\" The website \\"Sports on Earth\\" ranked the Kick Six game third in their list of the best college football games of all time. While the walk-off touchdown return was the game's most enduring image, SB Nation writer Ian Boyd argued in a 2014 story that its most significant play was not the return, but rather Marshall's touchdown pass to Coates with 32 seconds left, calling it a play that \\"brought football's future to the biggest stage.\\" Boyd's story quoted longtime college defensive coach Manny Diaz as calling this play \\"the most significant thing to happen to college football.\\" The play started out as a zone-read run play, but gave Marshall an additional option to pass; upon seeing the cornerback and free safety come up to stop the run, leaving Coates with no defender within 10 yards, Marshall pulled up just before reaching the line of scrimmage to throw to Coates. Naming the game After the game, the press identified Alabama's Achilles' heel: the kicking game. In reference to their four unsuccessful field goal attempts, writers called the game \\"Kick Bama Kick,\\" in reference to the 1972 Iron Bowl, nicknamed \\"Punt Bama Punt\\". At 6:43 p.m., just 18 minutes after of the conclusion of the game, Jon Solomon of The Birmingham News posted an article titled \\"Kick Bama Kick\\", but included an online poll allowing readers to select their favorite moniker. Among seven proposed titles, \\"Kick Bama Kick\\" won by a landslide. Ryan Black of the Ledger‚ÄìEnquirer in Columbus, Georgia titled an article \\"Kick, Bama, kick\\" within hours of the game's completion. Frank Cooney of Yahoo! Sports, who noted that the game will be \\"forever secured\\" in the discussion for the most dramatic college football game in history, also titled his piece \\"Kick Bama Kick\\" that evening. One year after the game, Sports Illustrated, CBS Sports and Fox Sports referred to it as the \\"Kick Six\\".The other side of a miracle: Looking back at historic Iron Bowl a year later, Sports IllustratedRemembering \\"Kick Six,\\" CBS SportsNo. 1 Alabama avenges 'Kick Six,' beats No. 15 Auburn in Iron Bowl, Fox Sports The term \\"Kick Six\\" is also used, in general, to refer to other instances of blocked or missed field goals being returned for a touchdown, such as one occurring in an NFL game on November 30, 2015, as performed by the Baltimore Ravens against the Cleveland Browns. The term is a play on the term \\"pick six\\", which refers to an interception being returned for a touchdown. Nominations and awards At the 2014 ESPY Awards, recognizing the greatest achievements in 2013, the 2013 Iron Bowl won the award for \\"Best Game\\". The other two nominees were Game Five of the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals and the Indianapolis Colts first round playoff victory. The game-winning touchdown return was named \\"Best Play\\" at the 2014 ESPYs. The play beat three other nominees including the play near the end of Auburn's game against Georgia.

It is a four-lane divided highway its entire length, and it is known as Keith Street. US 11 Byp. begins at an intersection with US 11/US 64 (SR 2, South Lee Highway) in Cleveland near Bradley Central High School. SR 2 turns north onto US 11 Byp., and runs as a hidden route. US 11/US 64 turns northeast into downtown as 3rd Street. At its terminus, it begins following immediately along South Mouse Creek.

At this intersection the Cleveland/Bradley County Greenway also begins, following alongside Mouse Creek. The route continues north through a historic residential district. Further along, US 11 Byp. comes to an intersection with SR 60 (25th Street). The route then enters a primarily commercial district, passing the corporate headquarters of the Life Care Centers of America, and turns northeast, crossing Mouse Creek and the Greenway. The route crosses Mouse Creek ridge, passing through commercial area, coming to an intersection with Woodcrest Avenue/Ocoee Crossing, a connector to US 11 (Ocoee Street). About later the bypass comes to an end at an intersection with US 11 (Ocoee Street). ;History Built as a bypass to relieve downtown Cleveland from industrial and commercial traffic, Keith Street was the first bypass and four lane highway in Bradley County. The project began in 1956, with construction near downtown Cleveland. The section between 17th Street was constructed between late 1959 and late 1960. Initially known as the Cleveland Bypass, Keith Street was named in honor of prominent local resident Keith Hines. Originally, the route's state designation was the State Route 2 Bypass, and SR 2 remained on the bypassed portion of US 11. In 1982, when TDOT modified their highway numbering system, SR 2 was rerouted onto Keith Street. The section of US 11 between the southern terminus of Keith Street and the intersection with US 64 became part of SR 40 (which continues on US 64 into North Carolina, and the section between US 64 and Keith Street's northern terminus became part of SR 74. ;Major intersections Athens business loop Business U.S. Highway 11 (Bus.

The route began at an intersection with US 11 (Market Street) and the eastern terminus of PA 641 (32nd Street) in Camp Hill, heading north on multilane 32nd Street. The road curved east and became Cumberland Boulevard, heading into Wormleysburg. Here, US 11 Byp. became Walnut Street and headed northeast, crossing a Pennsylvania Railroad line and coming to its terminus at an intersection with US 11/US 15 (Front Street) on the west bank of the Susquehanna River. US 11 Byp. was first designated in the 1930s. At this time, the route began at US 11/PA 641 in Camp Hill and headed north and east to Wormleysburg, where it intersected PA 14 at Front Street and headed southeast concurrent with that route on Front Street to end at US 11/US 15 at the west end of the Walnut Street Bridge over the Susquehanna River to Harrisburg. In 1941, the eastern terminus of the bypass route was cut back to Wormleysburg after US 11/US 15 were realigned to replace PA 14 on Front Street. In the 1940s, US 11 Byp. was replaced with mainline US 11, with the former alignment of US 11 between Camp Hill and Wormleysburg designated as US 11 Alt. Lemoyne alternate route U.S. Route 11 Alternate (US 11 Alt.) was an alternate route of US 11 between Camp Hill and Wormleysburg in Pennsylvania, passing through Lemoyne. US 11 Alt. began at US 11/US 15 at the intersection of 32nd and Market Streets in Camp Hill, heading east along Market Street. The route continued into Lemoyne and curved to the northeast, intersecting US 111 at 3rd Street. At this point, US 11 Alt. became concurrent with US 111 and the two routes continued northeast along Market Street, crossing a Pennsylvania Railroad line as the road curved northwest to follow the west bank of the Susquehanna River. US 11 Alt./US 111 became Front Street and passed the western ends of the Market Street Bridge and the Walnut Street Bridge, which both cross the river to Harrisburg. The alternate route continued along the west bank of the Susquehanna River into Wormleysburg, where it and US 111 both ended at an intersection with US 11/US 15 at Walnut Street, where Front Street continued north as US 11/US 15. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, Market Street through Camp Hill and Lemoyne was designated as part of US 11/PA 13, which crossed the Susquehanna River into Harrisburg on the Market Street Bridge. US 15 ran concurrent with US 11 on Market Street in Lemoyne east of State Street while US 111/PA 4 was concurrent east of 3rd Street in Lemoyne. In 1928, PA 5 was designated onto Front Street in Lemoyne and Wormleysburg while the PA 13 and PA 4 designations were decommissioned along Market Street. In the 1930s, PA 14 replaced the PA 5 designation along Front Street. US 11/US 15 were realigned to run along Front Street in 1941, replacing PA 14. In the 1940s, US 11 was shifted to bypass Lemoyne to the northwest, replacing US 11 Byp., while US 11 Alt. was designated onto the former alignment of US 11 between Camp Hill and Wormleysburg, running concurrent with US 15 between State Street in Lemoyne and Wormleysburg. US 15 was realigned to the west in the 1950s, following US 11 along the bypass, with US 111 extended north along US 11 Alt. to end at US 11/US 15 in Wormleysburg.

Migration is a dangerous part of a bird's life cycle, with many trade-offs; birds receive benefits from wintering and breeding in better quality habitats, at the price of higher predation risks and greater energy expenditure. Hazards during migration include storms, hunting, collisions with manmade objects such as wind turbines, and starvation. The risk of starvation is increased when stopover sites are lost through climate change or loss of habitat to development or agriculture. Mortality on both breeding and wintering grounds may be increased for similar reasons. Context Migrants tend to travel away from polar and temperate zones in the winter because of low temperatures and shortage of food in their breeding areas.Newton, I. (2007). Weather related mass-mortality events in migrants. British Ornithologists Union, 149, 453-467.Buskirk, J. V., Mulvihill, R. S., & Leberman, R. C. (2012). Phenotypic plasticity alone cannot explain climate-induced change in avian migration timing. Ecology and Evolution, 2(10), 2430-2437. During spring migration, birds return to their breeding sites to exploit the temporary superabundance of food, allowing them to raise more young.Newton, I. (2006). Can conditions experienced during migration limit the population levels of birds?. Journal of Ornithology, 147(2), 146-166. Many populations of migratory birds are in serious decline. Anthropogenic reasons for this include deforestation and habitat loss, hunting, pesticide uses, urbanization and climate change.Hutto, R. L. (1988). Is tropical deforestation responsible for the reported declines in neotropical migrant populations . American Birds, 42, 375-379. Identifying and understanding the processes and perils can allow us to implement effective management and conservation strategies for these species.Faaborg, J., Levey, D. J., Johnson, D. H., Holmes, R. T., Anders, A. D., Bildstein, K. L., et al. (2010). Conserving Migratory Land Birds In The New World: Do We Know Enough?. Ecological Applications, 20(2), 398-418. Immediate perils Bad weather In-flight mortality: poor weather conditions can significantly decrease bird populations, especially during migration. Most of weather- related in-flight mortalities are due to heavy storms, mist or rain. Passerines and other small sized birds are particularly affected by adverse in-flight weather conditions, but larger birds such as eagles and swans could also be killed. Mortality on breeding grounds: small, insect eating birds contribute to the majority of post-arrival deaths, but many other birds including waders and waterfowls are also distressed by weather changes on breeding grounds. Since young birds are inexperienced, they are more vulnerable than adults to extreme weather conditions. Mortality on wintering grounds: Unreasonably cold temperatures on the wintering grounds kills thousands of birds, resulting in 30-90% population declines of migratory birds. For example, between 27000 and 62000 ducks, mostly tufted duck and common pochard, starved to death during a very cold winter in March 1986. Hunting Migration routes of birds in Europe and Africa. Countries with most illegal hunting are coloured red and brown. The passing of Migratory Bird Treaty (US, 1916) and Migratory Birds Convention Act (Canada, 1917) made it illegal to kill or capture migratory birds. Even though migratory bird acts were passed at the beginning of the 19th century, many countries still have no laws or programs to protect migratory birds. International bird trade is a multibillion-dollar industry and hundreds of exotic birds are captured and then sold all over the world. Malta, an archipelago of small islands along the Mediterranean, is a very important migration flyway for birds.Falzon, M. A. (2008). Flight of passion hunting: Ecology and politics in Malta and the Mediterranean. Anthropology Today, 24(1), 15-20. Throughout the years, hunters killed hundreds of millions of birds each year as they migrate over the island of Malta. To protect resident and migratory birds, BirdLife international had been organizing special raptors camps since the late 1990s. Even though hunting is a part of Maltese people's culture, the interference from birdwatchers all over the world has led to decreased killings of birds. Bycatch from commercial fishing Black-browed Albatross caught on a long- line While hunting kills millions of terrestrial birds, the bycatch from commercial fisheries is responsible for the majority of human caused mortality of migratory birds. Scientists have estimated that between 2679 and 45586 birds are killed each year as fisheries by-catch. Dredging, gillnetting bottom otter trawling and longline's are some of the main methods fisheries use to catch fish. Gillnets are responsible for the majority of seabird bycatch, followed by longline and bottom trawling. To catch tuna and other fish, long- line fishing boats drag many kilometers of hooked lines behind them. Seabirds try to catch the fish and accidentally get trapped in hooks.Ellis, J. I., WIlhelm, S. I., Hedd, A., Fraser, G. S., Robertson, G. F., Rail, J. F., et al. (2013). \\"Mortality of Migratory Birds from Marine Commercial Fisheries and Offshore Oil and Gas Production in Canada\\". Avian Conservation and Ecology, 8(2), 4-10. Major foraging areas for vulnerable seabirds (albatrosses and shearwaters) tend to overlap with world's richest fishing grounds, thus increasing the proportions of accidental bycatch of birds. Fisheries could also indirectly affect the trophic structure and foraging methods of seabirds. Since most sea birds are long-lived and have low reproduction rates, even a small increase in bird mortality could cause significant population declines. Stopover habitat loss Birds use stopover sites to feed, rest and refuel during their migration period.Catry, P., EncarnacaÀúo, V., Arau jo, A., Fearon, P., Fearon, A., Armelin, M. and Delaloye, P. 2004. Are long-distance migrant passerines faithful to their stopover sites? Journal of Avian Biol. 35, 170-/181. Many of the current stopover sites are threatened due increased urbanization, agriculture, gas exploitation, fisheries, tourism and many others anthropogenic activities. In one study the researchers found that birds with high phenotypic plasticity can adapt their behavior and skip low-quality stopover sites. Migratory birds such as swans, geese and waders show high site fidelity (they are loyal to their stopover and cannot change them), while long distance passerines have much lower site fidelity. Passerines have low site fidelity because they can be flexible in their habitat selection. Since they do not migrate in flocks, migratory passerines do not have a fixed migration route or stop-over site sequence and they can change their stopover sites based on wind selectivity or habitat quality. Even though many birds can change their stopover sites, birds such as swans and waders depend on wetland stopover sites to 'refuel' on migration. The destruction of these sites could therefore be detrimental to bird populations. Increased predation at stopover sites could lead to drastic declines in migratory bird populations.Lank, D. B., & Ydenberg, R. C. (2003). Death and danger at migratory stopovers: problems with ‚Äúpredation risk‚Äù. Journal of Avian Biology, 34(3), 225-228. The study done by Lank and Ydenberg (2003) examined the effects of predators on migratory birds at stopover sites. The researchers found that predation risk is higher for heavier birds (due to decreased take-off ability) and leaner birds (increased exposure due to higher feeding needs). Many birds also developed anti-predator behaviors to lower the probability of mortality. Since anti-predator behaviors are energetically costly, the migrants with lower energy reserves allocated less time to anti-predator behaviors. Collisions and confusion at oil platforms Over 40 million seabirds are negatively affected by oil platforms.Weise, F. K., Montevecchi, W. A., Davoren, G. K., Huettmann, F., Diamond, A. W., & Linke, J. (2001). \\"Seabirds at risk around offshore oil platforms in the North-west Atlantic\\". Marine Pollution Bulletin, 42(12), 1285-1290. Seabirds tend to aggregate around oil rigs, attracted by artificial lighting, flares, food and other visual cues. Seabirds often collide directly with oil platforms or circle around oil rigs and flares for days, eventually dying of starvation. Birds such as storm petrels, dovekies and shearwaters migrate across the Grand Banks and hydrocarbon development near the oil platforms significantly decreases the populations of these birds. Poisoning by pesticides Since there are very little regulations regarding pesticide use in the tropics, the farmers in South America use high quantities of highly toxic pesticides to protect their crops. For example, DDT is currently banned in North America because it killed millions of birds in the 1960s, but it is still heavily used in the tropics. Pesticides can kill birds both directly and indirectly. In the case of DDT, it can kill birds directly by poisoning their nervous system and indirectly by making the eggshells thinner and thus reducing reproductive success of birds. In their study on Dickcissels and crop damage in Venezuela, Basili and Temple (1999), found that the population of Dickcissels declined by 40% between the years of 1960 and 1980. The declines were primarily due to direct killings by humans. Dickcissels migrate to Venezuela in winter and they tend to gather in large colonies (millions of birds) to feed and sleep. Farmers in Venezuela thought that Dickcissels were pests that fed on rice and cereal crops, so they aerially sprayed the region with pesticides to kill of the birds. The dickcissels consumed only 0.37-0.745% of the grains produced. If the farmers had been better informed of how small of an impact Dickcissels had on their crops, the population declines of these birds could have been prevented. Navigation disrupted by light pollution Image of the Earth at night. Only a portion of Earth's surface remains dark at night. Night skies are obscured by artificial lights in many cities around the world.Longcore, T., & Rich, C. (2004). Ecological light pollution. The Ecological Society Of America, 2(4), 191-198. These lights are illuminated from buildings, roads and other human structures. When flying across the city, migratory birds could become attracted to artificial lights in the sky. These birds tend to follow light beams and fly continuously in circles, dying from exhaustion or predators as the result. Increased illumination due to artificial lighting could also disrupt foraging behavior of diurnal birds, making these species forage at night, instead of the day. The negative effects from artificial lights are particularly evident in bad weather and when stars are covered by clouds, because birds that migrate at night use light beams for navigation. To decrease the impact of artificial lighting, many cities had implemented lights out program, in which people turn off or dim the lights in tall buildings during migration season. Collisions with buildings Bird killed by striking a high-speed train Artificial light sources can attract millions of birds to lighthouses, broadcast towers and other buildings, resulting in direct mortality of birds at night. There are less artificial lights during the day, but millions of birds still die due to direct collisions with various human made structures.Klem, D. (1990). Collisions between Birds and Windows: Mortality and Prevention . Journal of Field Ornithology, 61(1), 120-128. Birds often fatally strike the glass because they cannot differentiate between real sky and reflection of a sky in a window. Any object that increases bird density near windows can potentially lead to higher death rates. Reflective windows are particularly dangerous as birds are often attracted to them. Placing bird attractants such as bird houses, water and nutritious vegetation near windows also increases the number of birds killed. In his study on window collisions and bird mortality, Klem banded an indigo bunting that survived window collision, only for it to be killed striking the same window the following year. He estimated that the annual mortality of birds due to window collisions in United States was between 95-975 million birds per year. To reduce bird strikes, it is suggested to remove all bird attractants near the windows or to partially cover the windows. For new buildings, scientists have recommended installing windows in a way that panes reflect the ground instead of the sky. Collisions and disruption from wind farms Wind turbines kill thousands of birds through collisions, disruption of migratory routes and destruction of habitat. Birds such as raptors (eagles, vultures), waterbirds and passerines are particularly affected. The reasons these birds are affected is because many of them have blind spots and they often cannot see objects (wind farms) directly in front of them. In Altamont Pass Wind Farm, 4000 wind turbines kill 75 golden eagles and over 1, 200 other predatory birds each year. These predatory birds are rare and long lived; they also have low reproductive rates and if their populations decline substantially, they may never recover. However, if wind turbines are constructed in regions that do not overlap with migratory pathways of birds, the bird casualties could be significantly reduced.Drewitt, A. l., & Lagston, R. H. (2006). Assessing the impacts of wind farms on birds. British Ornithologists Union, 148, 29-42. Contributory factors Deforestation Forest burned for agriculture in Mexico Forest fragmentation is one of the greatest perils to migratory birds.Wells, J. S., Lefkowith, S. C., Chavarria, G., & Dyer, S. (2008). Impact on Birds of Tar Sands Oil Development in Canada‚Äôs Boreal Forest. Natural Resources Defense Council, 1, 1-39.Rappole, J. H., Ramoa, M. A., & Winker, K. (1989). Wintering wood thrush movements and mortality in Southern Veracruz. Nature, 106, 402-410. Fragmented areas tend to have more parasites, increased nest predation and lower habitat heterogeneity. Habitat loss also means that the region has lower carrying capacity and this leads to increased intraspecific competition between territorial species. In 1989, John Rappole made early use of radio-tags to monitor the location of Wood Thrushes in Veracruz Mexico. Since the 1960s this region had lost over 50% of its forest cover. Rappole noticed that primary rainforests were occupied almost exclusively by older wood thrush. First year birds are smaller and inexperienced, thus they cannot compete with older birds and are forced to live along the forest edge. Younger birds often become wanderers and they are more likely to be eaten by hawks and other predators. These negative conditions in wintering grounds experienced by young and late arriving birds could potentially carry over to breeding habitats, altering population dynamics and lowering the fitness levels of effected bird species.Norris, D. R., & Taylor, C. M. (2006). Predicting the consequences of carry-over effects for migratory populations. Biol. Lett., 2, 148-151. Deforestation leads to fragmented forest habitats and nest predators tend to be more abundant in these fragmented landscapes.Wilcove, D, S. \\"Nest predation in forest tracts and the decline of migratory songbirds\\". Ecology 66.4 (1985): 1211-1214. If the fragmented area is long and narrow, it will have greater predation rates because it can easily be reached by nest predators from other areas. Compared to rural woodlots, nest predation rates were higher in suburban areas due higher densities of nest predators such as Blue Jay, Common Grackle, raccoons, dogs, cats and rats. Deforestation thus affects population cycles of birds by changing predator-prey relationships and making the birds more susceptible to predators. Oil developments at the tar sands is one of the main causes of deforestation in Canada. Less than 14% of Alberta's boreal forest remains intact. Loss of Canadian boreal forest is a threat to migratory birds. Climate change pied flycatchers no longer arrive at breeding grounds at the optimal time to nest. Migratory birds are seriously affected by climate change because they cannot assess changes in spring weather from their wintering grounds.Both, C., & Viesser, M. E. (2001). Adjustment to climate change is constrained by arrival date in a long-distance migrant bird. Nature, 411, 296-298. Higher spring temperatures can lead to earlier increases in insect abundance, but many bird species were not able to advance their arrival dates. For example, pied flycatchers timed their egg hatch cycles with subsequent increases in food to raise as many young as possible. Spring migration based on day length had allowed flycatchers to arrive on time, and their egg laying times correlated with insect abundances. However, due to climate change, the flycatchers are now forced to lay eggs earlier, which leaves these birds not enough time to prepare their nests properly. Climate change poses a serious threat to long distance migrant birds because they arrive at inappropriate time to exploit environmental opportunities, and face higher competition with resident species. Birds such as the pied flycatcher can start nesting earlier, but their arrival time at the breeding grounds does not change because birds cannot remotely sense temperature changes on breeding grounds from their wintering grounds. The birds cannot depart their wintering grounds unless they have enough energy and fat reserves to support their migration journey, and since early arriving birds usually get the best resources, most species face intense competition for early arrival and early departure. For example, in American redstart, individuals with better phenotypic qualities arrive and mate first.Kokko, H. (1999). Competition for early arrival in migratory birds. Journal of Animal Ecology, 68, 940-950.

Dyckman served as president of the Consumers League of NJ (CLNJ) from 1944 to 1956 and chaired their Child Labor Committee.Manuscripts: Dyckman, Mary L. Papers, 1903-1982 (bulk 1940-1972) CLNJ later named their distinguished service award the Mary L. Dyckman Award in recognition of her achievements. Early life and education Dyckman was born to Louise (Heroy) Dyckmam and Francis Henry Dyckman, a banker and miller, in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota on August 19, 1886. She was a sister of Heroy Dyckman, Francis Dyckman, and business executive Richard P. Dyckman. Richard Dyckman served as the mayor of Plainfield, New Jersey and as a vice president of L.A. Dreyfus Company, now a subsidiary of the Wrigley Company. Dyckman was also a descent of Dutch farmer William Dyckman, the namesake of Dyckman Street in Manhattan; William Dyckman built the Dyckman House (now the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum), the oldest farmhouse in Manhattan. At the age of four, Dyckman moved with her family to Orange, New Jersey.; her father, Francis, grew up in Orange as the son of William Henry Dyckman and Eliza Mackenzie Dyckman. He founded the State Bank in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota after moving out West. He also founded the Dyckman Free Library. In 1905, Dyckman graduated from the Beard School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Orange after taking classes in the Latin-Scientific course of study. (Classmates and friends spelled her name Marie rather than Mary.) Astronomy was her favorite subject at school. Dyckman's father, Francis, wanted her to have diverse, enriching experiences as a child. He brought her to see the conditions of factory workers; this influenced her later interest in occupational health and safety. During high school, Dyckman and her family took a trip to Europe. During their visit to Italy, she began developing an interest in challenges faced by foreign workers. After high school, Dyckman trained as a visiting caseworker with Boston Associated Charities in Boston, Massachusetts from 1909 to 1911. She then trained as a social worker at the New York School of Social Work (now Columbia University's School of Social Work) in Manhattan. During her studies, Dyckman worked as a visiting caseworker in Orange, New Jersey and the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Social work activities Dyckman served as district secretary for the Bureau of Associated Charities in Newark, New Jersey and then as executive secretary of the League for Friendly Service of Bloomfield and Glen Ridge, New Jersey. During her time at the later, she assisted the activities of the committees to address tuberculosis and manage general finances. Dyckman later served as assistant financial secretary for the New York Charity Organization Society, and she chaired the casework committee of the Family Welfare Association of America. In 1930, she helped organize the advocacy activities of a group that sought to sell the municipal light plant in Orange, New Jersey. The group's work led to the passage of a citizen's referendum that sold the plant. Six years later, Dyckman retired from her professional activities as a social worker, and she moved on to volunteer causes. After receiving election to CLNJ's executive board in 1938, Dyckman chaired an inter-organizational committee to examine concerns with existing child labor laws. The work of this committee led to the passage of New Jersey's Child Labor Act of 1940. This law raised the minimum working age for children to 12 and reduced the number of hours that age-eligible children could work. Additionally, the law prohibited children under age 16 from working during school hours. Dyckman's later recommendations to Governor Walter Edge on protections for migrant workers directly led to the passage of New Jersey's Migrant Law of 1945. This law was the first of its kind in the U.S. In 1941, Dyckman testified before a Congressional hearing held by the Select Committee Investigating National Defense Migration in the U.S. House of Representatives. The hearing investigated the consequences of inter-state migration caused by the National Defense program. Legacy The Special Collections and University Archives at Rutgers University's libraries in New Brunswick, New Jersey houses Dyckman's papers and other works from 1903-1982. It includes correspondence from Joseph Califano (from his time as special assistant to President Lyndon Johnson) and Alice Hamilton, president of the National Consumers League. The Newark Public Library in Newark, New Jersey also contains a collection of her works from 1925-1984.

Political career Student Movement During the turbulent sixties, when the hatred and terror against the Communists reigned supreme, Field Marshal K. M. Cariappa was launching an anti-Communist propaganda in a speech at the Jadavpur University campus, where he was intent to prove the Communists as seditious. Then Field Marshal K. M. Cariappa had asked \\"Is there a Communist in this room?\\" The student who could stand up bravely and proudly \\"Yes sir. Here is one. I am Sankar Gupta, I am a Communist\\" - a statement which later became legendary among the leftist student leaders in the years to follow. One of the prime organisers of the Bengal Provincial Committee of the All India Students Federation, which split later in 1964 following ideological battle against revisionism, he along with the major fraction of the Bengal Provincial Committee took a leftist stand and the fraction came to be known as the BPSF (Left) or SF(Left). He married fellow SF(Left) leader Shyamali, who later became a member of CPI(M) Central Committee, and the All-India President of the All India Democratic Women's Association. As BPSF leaders, they took active role in organizing protest rallies against the Vietnam War in the sixties, and expressed solidarity with the Vietnamese people's struggle for liberty and socialism.http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-cpi-m-leader- shyamali-gupta-passes-away-1924778 Education Movement As his comrades Shyamal Chakraborty, Biman Bose, Subhas Chakraborty became wholetimers of the CPI(M), Sankar could not turn out to be one as he had to look after his family being the eldest son. He took a job in the Burul High School (near Nodakhali in South 24 Parganas district). He continued to instill fervour in the Students' Movement. In March 1967, he took a job as an assistant professor in the University of North Bengal. In the same year, he married Shyamali as she was released from prison. Even during the times of Naxal terror, he remained in Siliguri and continued to inspire the students, and organized the university teachers' movement. He was also a member of the West Bengal State Committee of the Democratic Youth Federation (which later merged into the Democratic Youth Federation of India). Wholetime Political Worker As Shyamali Gupta got a job in the Bankura College, he instantaneously decided to leave his job to be a full-time CPI(M) worker in the early seventies. In 1977, when Jyoti Basu became the Chief Minister of the 1st Left Front Government, Sankar Gupta was asked to be his Political Secretary. In 1982 assembly elections, Sankar Gupta contested and won from Jadavpur. He was made the Minister of Power in the 2nd Left Front Government. In 1983, he became the member of the CPI(M) West Bengal State Committee. He along with Shyamal Chakraborty met with a severe accident as they were heading towards Santaldih from Durgapur to stop the closure of the Santaldih Thermal Power Station. Even with ailing health as he hopped between hospitals for treatment, he continued his work to increase power generation. Death He died untimely at the age of 43, just one year into his tenure as a minister and as an MLA.

It was formed on 1 April 2012 as a replacement for the London Development Agency (LDA) as an arms length corporate body to take on the assets of the LDA and other agencies, under the direction of the Mayor of London. It is one of the largest public sector landowners in London and its primary aims are to create jobs and housing. GLAP is headquartered in Windsor House, Westminster in the offices used by Transport for London. Formation The Localism Act 2011 required that the assets and liabilities of the LDA should be transferred to the Greater London Authority, and that all commercial activities relating to land and property should be undertaken by a subsidiary company. According to the 2012/2013 report and accounts, the principal activities of GLAP are \\"the purchase, sale and development of land or property, and the holding of land or property for capital growth or rental\\". Its primary aims are creating jobs and housing in London. Land holdings 635 hectares of land in Greater London are held by the company, transferred from the London Development Agency, London Thames Gateway Development Corporation (not including Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park) and the London part of the Homes and Communities Agency. The most significant single asset of GLAP is the Greenwich Peninsula and a high proportion of the land is in East London. In addition to the land owned by GLAP, the Greater London Authority owns the considerable property portfolios of the London Fire Brigade, Metropolitan Police Service and Transport for London. The following land holdings are over 10 hectares: *Greenwich Peninsula *Former Cane Hill Hospital site *Excel Centre *Beam Park *Beam Reach *Silvertown Quays *Crystal Palace National Sports Centre *London Sustainable Industries Park *Royals Business Park *Britannia Village *Land on the south side of King George V Dock *Former Parcelforce site, West Ham *University of East London Governance GLAP is held by a holding company called Greater London Authority Holdings Limited, created at the same time. Greater London Authority Holdings Limited does not trade and has no other subsidiaries. GLAP is not permitted to borrow directly from the Public Works Loan Board, but the Greater London Authority can borrow on its behalf. This was needed because GLAP inherited a borrowing requirement of approximately ¬£300m from the LDA. The liabilities transferred from the LDA include the costs of the compulsory purchase of land for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. It is anticipated this will be repaid from the sale of other assets.

Clark was born in London and entered the Baptist College at Nottingham as a student for the ministry. After filling several charges in London and the provinces, he accepted the pastorate of the Baptist Church in Albert Park, Melbourne, Victoria (Australia) where he arrived in April 1869. Having been very successful as an amateur lecturer on secular subjects, Clark resigned his pastoral charge in 1874, and lectured professionally throughout the Australian colonies with extraordinary success. > Mr. Clark was gifted with a wonderfully retentive memory, great dramatic > force, a powerful and melodious voice, and, above all, a fine quality of > delicate sympathy and largeheartedness which brought him into direct touch > with the public, and instinctively prompted him to select for his themes > subjects which appealed to the emotions and loftier sensibilities of all > classes of the community. Acting on the maxim 'The highest study of mankind > is man,' Mr. Clark committed to memory the choicest selections from the > writings of Charles Dickens, and recited them with such remarkable displays > of feeling as to move his hearers either to laughter or to tears; He was > just the kind of man to enter into the spirit of Dickens's works, and to > represent him fairly; for, like that immortal author, he had wide sympathies > for all that is human, a keen eye for the grotesque, and a profound contempt > for all hypocrisies, and make-believes. But his repertoire covered an > extensive and interesting field, and his chief aim was to convey instruction > on the history and poetry of the British nation. A lecture on 'Christmas in > Old England' was repeated hundreds of times, and another on the 'Tower of > London' was immensely .successful. After a tour in America in 1876, where he attracted large audiences, he returned to Australia, but shortly afterwards left for England, where he remained till 1889, when he revisited Australia, and achieved a considerable measure of his former success. He again toured Australia in 1896, which was also a success. Clark died on 29 March 1903 in Bristol, England.

At the time, the other Melbourne stations usually began their broadcasting day in the afternoon, and as such In Melbourne Today was an early experiment in morning programming, pre-dating Sydney station ATN-7's October 1958 experiment.

Regulars in this version included host Geoff Corke, along with the Tune Twisters, newsreader Eric Pearce, Eric Welch (sports), Shirley Radford, Arlene Forrest, and Bill McCormack.

Radboud Castle is one of a number of castles in North Holland. The building was commissioned by Floris V, Count of Holland. When exactly it was built is unknown, but the castle was completed before the St. Lucia's Flood of 13 December 1287. On 24 June 1517 the castle saved some of the Medemblik townsfolk from the raids of Grutte Pier and his Arumer Zwarte Hoop (a band of marauding pirates). On 12 August 1588 the castle surrendered to Diederik Sonoy and the Geuzen. The defensive function of the castle was reduced with the building of walls around the city of Medemblik in 1572 and due to both dismantling and lack of maintenance there was attrition of the castle buildings. Restoration In 1889 the control of the property was returned to the state. Restorations were done by the State architect J. van Lokhorst with advice from R.J.H. Cuypers and the castle was used for the district court of justice until 1934. In 1931 a cannery near the castle burnt down exposing the foundations of a tower on the north west of the site and during 1936 the castle-moat was restored. From 1964 to 1965 further restorations were done with a more historical and architectural correctness and some of the previous renovations were removed. Recent history On 4 September 1939 The Night Watch by Rembrandt was stored here temporarily before being moved in May 1940 to a bunker in the dunes near Castricum.

The debt itself can refer to the amount spent in the lead up to travelling, during the trip and any unexpected costs which come about from that trip, such as cross currency conversion fees and foreign ATM access charges. The condition of debt-lag may last months or even years after a person's trip is complete, as long as the debt accrued within the travel period is still outstanding. It is recommended that sufferers of debt-lag seek treatment as soon as possible to avoid paying exorbitant fees in interest charges. The term debt-lag is similar to jet lag in that both have to do with travel, however travellers can be affected by debt-lag without leaving their time zone. Jet lag refers to the condition sustained by the body after rapid long-distance travel which requires days of adjustment upon return. Debt-lag works in much the same way as it refers to a traveller's need to adjust upon return as well, except it is more directly related to the traveller's financial situation than their biological one. Causes Debt-lag is primarily attributed to spending on credit cards while abroad, including paying for items before travel such as transportation costs and accommodation. It is estimated that roughly 85% of travellers use their credit card while on holiday, presumably because of the ease of use, wide acceptance, ability to earn rewards points and security features of credit cards. Independent's 'Credit cards vs debit cards' - July 2012 Debt-lag is not strictly tied to the distance or duration of a trip, but longer trips will typically cost more and thus cause more severe cases of debt-lag. It is a financial problem more commonly found in men than in women, with over two in five men suffering credit card shock upon return compared to less than one in three women. Credit Card Finder The speed at which a person recovers from debt-lag is largely dependent on the individual's financial situation and any extenuating circumstances met with while travelling. Lack of travel insurance in cases of emergency and/or disruption to travel can exacerbate debt-lag, especially with one in four travelling without cover. ABTA press release: 'Numbers travelling abroad uninsured on the rise' - January 2013 One of the most common unexpected costs incurred while travelling overseas is last-minute transport or accommodation changes, The Daily Telegraph's 'Always pack a travel policy' - December 2013 which could be covered by a comprehensive travel insurance policy. A common cause of debt-lag is tied to fees and charges by financial institutions to access their services while overseas. In fact, these hidden charges, such as currency conversion fees and foreign ATM access charges, are cited as the top \\"travel rip-offs\\" experienced by travellers. The Herald Sun's 'One in three travellers return from holiday owing more than $2000 on credit cards' - December 2013 There is no maximum to debt-lag attributed debt, although it is largely limited by an individual's credit limit and ability to accrue debt. Inversely, there is no limit to the amount of time it takes to resolve debt-lag as repayment habits, compound interest charges and the ability to continually accrue debt even after the trip is complete can make the debt rollover perpetually. Over a third of people would holiday again before paying down their debt-lag induced debt,The Sunday Age's 'Holiday Spending's Big Hurt' on 1 December 2013 lengthening the duration of this condition. Management Budgeting and proper care of one's finances is the strongest stimulus for ridding oneself of debt-lag. This includes preparation, research and budgeting around optimal financial products for travel, both before and after travel. Before travelling Many banks and financial institutions will have specific travel products on offer such as prepaid travel money cards or credit cards with little or no currency conversion fees and complimentary travel insurance. These kinds of financial products will often be far better suited to travel than typical banking products and will minimise the amount spent on fees and charges associated with travel. Another alternative option for travellers to take their money with them is traveller's checks. These are a very secure method of taking money abroad but aren‚Äôt widely accepted. Independent Traveler's tips on the best way to carry money overseas During Travel There are a few product features that will affect how you should use your financial products overseas. These include: *credit card purchase credit card purchase rate and cash advance rates *prepaid travel card reload fees *foreign ATM usage fees *currency conversion fees Knowing these fees and the circumstance in which they are charged can help travellers avoid them Rick Steve's tips to avoid overseas fees and thus lowers the chances of severe debt-lag upon return. After Travelling The period directly after travel is crucial to minimising the long-term effects of debt-lag. If the debt is paid off in a timely manner, the traveller can avoid paying interest, especially if they incorporated interest free days Credit Card Finder - 'What are Interest Free Days?' into their budget before travelling. While the majority of travellers believe they can pay back their debt within just a few months, those who fail to do so can find themselves paying thousands in interest on top of having to pay back their initial debt amount. A balance transfer of the debt to a low rate or zero percent credit card can help alleviate the stress of long-term debt-lag.

A prominent member of the League of Left-Wing Writers, he was one of the Five Martyrs of the Left League executed in February 1931 by the Kuomintang government. Hu was the first husband of the celebrated writer Ding Ling, who was also a member of the Left League, and a close friend of the writer Shen Congwen. Life and career Hu Yepin and Ding Ling in 1926 He was born Hu Peiji () on 4 May 1903 in Fuzhou, Fujian province. He had four younger brothers and a younger sister. At age 15 he began working as an apprentice of a goldsmith. In 1920 Hu moved to Shanghai, where he attended Pudong High School, and changed his name to Hu Chongxuan (). A year later he went to Tianjin to study at the Dagukou navy academy. However, the navy academy was shut down soon afterwards, and he drifted to nearby Beijing. He changed his name again to Hu Yepin. In the summer of 1924, Hu met Ding Ling, who had recently arrived in Beijing from Shanghai. They fell in love and became unofficially married in 1925. At the end of 1928, Hu, Ding, and their close friend, writer Shen Congwen, left Beijing for Shanghai. The trio founded the Red and Black Publishing House and its journal Red and Black. The venture was unsuccessful, and closed soon afterwards. To repay his debts, Hu accepted a teaching job at the provincial high school in Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, in 1929. According to linguist Ji Xianlin, who was a student at the high school, the arrival of Hu Yepin and his fashionable wife Ding Ling from Shanghai caused a sensation at the school. In May 1930, the Kuomintang government ordered the arrest of Hu for his pro-Communist teaching. Hu and Ding were forced to leave Jinan and returned to Shanghai, where they joined the League of Left-Wing Writers, which had just been established two months before. Hu served as an executive committee member of the league. In November 1930, Hu joined the Communist Party of China. In the same month, Ding Ling gave birth to a boy named Hu Xiaopin (), who was later renamed Jiang Zulin () after Hu Yepin's death, using Ding Ling's real surname Jiang. Arrest and execution In September 1930, the Kuomintang leader Chen Lifu formally banned the Left League. Orders were also issued to arrest its members. The League was driven underground. On 17 January 1931, while attending a secret Communist Party meeting at the Oriental Hotel in the British concession of Shanghai, Hu was arrested along with other attendees by the British police. When Hu failed to return home, Ding Ling and Shen Congwen searched frantically for him. A day later, Shen received confirmation that Hu had been arrested by the British police and extradited to the Kuomintang, and was imprisoned in Longhua, suburban Shanghai, where many Communists were held. Shen and Ding sought help from prominent intellectuals including Hu Shih, Xu Zhimo, Cai Yuanpei, and Shao Lizi, who lobbied Chen Lifu and the Shanghai mayor Zhang Qun for Hu's release, all to no avail. On 7 February 1931, the Kuomintang executed 23 Communists in Longhua, including three women, one pregnant. Hu Yepin was one of the five members of the Left League executed on that day, along with Rou Shi, Li Weisen, Yin Fu, and Feng Keng. Together they are remembered as the Five Martyrs of the League of Left-Wing Writers by the Communist Party of China. The circumstances of Hu's arrest along with other communists had been controversial. However, most publications in China and Taiwan now agree that they were betrayed by members of a rival Communist faction, possibly Wang Ming and his close associates, Gu Shunzhang and Tang Yu. Works Hu Yepin's early writings, such as Where to Go (), were semi-autobiographical, reflecting his sense of despair over the widespread poverty and hopelessness that were prevalent in China during the 1920s. A Pearl in the Brain () was one of his most highly regarded works. Hu was one of the few among the May Fourth writers who wrote in the then-new vernacular Chinese language with ease. In all of Hu's novels, the poor always lose. His reaction against social injustice made him susceptible to the influence of the Communist ideology. In 1930, the year he joined the Communist Party, and shortly before his execution, he published the novella To Moscow () and the novel A Bright Future ().

It contains all of Alice's AIML files, with many additions from user generated conversations, and is always a work in progress. Worswick claims she has been worked on since 2005. Her intelligence includes the ability to reason with specific objects. For example, if someone asks \\"Can you eat a house?\\", Mitsuku looks up the properties for \\"house\\". Finds the value of \\"made_from\\" is set to \\"brick\\" and replies \\"no\\", as a house is not edible. She can play games and do magic tricks at the user's request. In 2015 she conversed, on average, in excess of a quarter of a million times daily. In a Wall Street Journal article titled ‚ÄúAdvertising‚Äôs New Frontier: Talk to the Bot,‚Äù technology reporter Christopher Mims made the case for ‚Äúchatvertising‚Äù in a piece about Mitsuku and Kik Messenger: > If it seems improbable that so many teens‚Äî80% of Kik's users are under > 22‚Äîwould want to talk to a robot, consider what the creator of an award- > winning, Web-accessible chat bot named Mitsuku told an interviewer in 2013. > \\"What keeps me going is when I get emails or comments in the chat-logs from > people telling me how Mitsuku has helped them with a situation whether it > was dating advice, being bullied at school, coping with illness or even > advice about job interviews.

Mitsuku has been featured in a number of other news outlets. Fast Company described Mitsuku as ‚Äúquite impressive‚Äù and declared her the victor over Siri in a chatbot smackdown. A blog post for the Guardian on loneliness explored the role chatbots like Mitsuku and Microsoft‚Äôs XiaoIce play as companions, rather than mere assistants, in peoples' emotional lives. Some of Mitsuku‚Äôs AIML is available for free online at mitsuku.com, and Pandorabots makes a version of the Mitsuku chatbot available as a service via its API in the form of a module.

Part of the Beaverton School District (BSD), the school offered grades 6 through 12. Opened in 2007, the school was housed in the Capital Center at 185th Avenue and Walker Road in Hillsboro. Since the beginning of 2016, the school has been directly adjacent to another BSD option school, the School of Science & Technology, with the relocation of that school to the Capital Center at the end of 2015. The school hosts a HOSA- Future Health Professionals chapter. For the 2020-2021 school year and onward, this school and the neighboring school, the School of Science and Technology have merged to become the Beaverton Academy of Science and Engineering. History The school district started the school in September 2007 with 120 students in ninth grade as an option program, intending to add students each year until it included grades six through twelve. In January 2008, the district purchased the Capital Center from Portland Community College and the Oregon University System for $15 million to serve as the home for the Health & Science School. Plans called for an additional $6 million to be spent remodeling the center for use by the school. The Capital Center was previously a campus of Tektronix that was sold in 1995 to a consortium of local public education entities with plans that included using part of it for a regional high school. In 2008, the school was one of six district schools that failed to provide enough class time to meet a state mandate. Three students were arrested on accusations of arson for a fire in a bathroom at the school in April 2011. Also in 2011, the school was rated as needing improvement by the state after it failed to hold some state mandated tests. The school was identified as one of several schools that would take students with the closure of Terra Nova High School in 2012. Female students participated in the Hermanas Conference sponsored by Intel Corporation in February 2013. Unfortunately, class 2019-2020 will be the last class for this school. Health and Science will be merging with Science and Technology to form BASE. An acronym for Beaverton Academy for Science and Technology. These new changes will be affective for class 2020-2021 and on. Academics Health & Science School is an option school; students opt out of their neighborhood school and are entered into a lottery for one of the limited spots at the school. As of 2013 it had an achievement index rating from the state of 56 and a rating of below average. Enrollment for the 2012 to 2013 school year was 687 students. The high school adheres to a rigorous dual credit program that is incorporated into the Expeditionary Learning curriculum. Students have the opportunity to earn college credit in math, biomedical science, engineering, foreign language and science courses through OIT (Oregon Institute of Technology), PCC (Portland Community College) and PSU (Portland State University).

Knight, a native of Tasmania, began playing basketball in his hometown of Burnie as a youth. After a year at the Australian Institute of Sport in 2003, Knight ventured to the United States where he played four years of college basketball for Loyola Marymount University (LMU). After graduating from LMU, Knight joined the NBL ranks and had a two-year stint with the West Sydney Razorbacks / Sydney Spirit between 2007 and 2009. With the demise of the Spirit following the 2008‚Äì09 season, Knight moved to Europe and played one season in Hungary for Soproni KC. Knight returned to the NBL in 2010 and joined the Perth Wildcats. He made a home for himself in Perth and quickly earned a reputation as one of the best big men in the league. With the Wildcats, Knight became a four-time All-NBL Team member and a three-time NBL champion (2014, 2016 and 2017). Knight endured a long list of injuries during his tenure with the Wildcats, having struggled with calf, shoulder, ankle and toe complaints, as well as suffering a number of concussion-related incidents. Three head knocks early on in the 2017‚Äì18 season led to Knight announcing his retirement from the NBL on 6 November 2017. Early life Born in Burnie, Tasmania, Knight played both basketball and Australian rules football as a junior. He was a talented footballer growing up, following in the steps of his father, Scott, who played five games for Collingwood in the VFL in 1984 before carving out an accomplished career in Tasmania. Knight went to watch his father play every Saturday, and during the week, he'd go with him to training. He played football right up until the end of secondary school. At that stage, he had to make a decision, and he'd heard there was more opportunity to go overseas with basketball, so he chose to commit to basketball. He also wanted to get away from the shadow of his father. Knight attended Smithton High School in 1997 and 1998 before linking up with the Tasmanian Institute of Sport (TIS) and joining the TIS Basketball Elite Development Squad. In 2002, Knight played in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) for the NW Tasmania Brewers and earned SEABL South Australian Youth Player of the Year honours. He subsequently earned a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and moved to Canberra in 2003. That year, he played for the AIS men's basketball team in the SEABL, and was a member of the Australian junior national team that won the gold medal at the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Thessaloniki, Greece. He played alongside future NBA player Andrew Bogut, and was coached by his future NBL mentor Rob Beveridge. During his junior basketball career, Knight played for the Tasmania under-16 team in 1999 and 2000, the under-18 team in 2001 and 2002, and the under-20 team in 2003. He was also a member of the All-Australian Junior Camp in 2002 and 2003, and played for Australia at the Oceania Qualification Series in 2002. College career Freshman year On 10 June 2003, Knight and future Perth Wildcats teammate Damian Martin signed National Letters of Intent to join the Loyola Marymount University men's basketball program. Knight was slowed by ankle surgery following the 2003 FIBA World Championship and subsequently missed the first six games of the 2003‚Äì04 season. He played 18 games for the Lions as a freshman, with his 3.5-rebounds-per-game average ranking 11th all-time among freshmen at LMU. He also averaged 4.9 points per game. Sophomore year As a sophomore in 2004‚Äì05, Knight proved to be the go-to-guy for the Lions all season, and for his efforts, he earned All-West Coast Conference honorable mention honours. He finished the regular season averaging a team-best 15.4 points and 5.9 rebounds per game while starting all 28 games. He led the team in minutes played (28.9 per game), and led the team in scoring in 18 contests. His 10.5-point turn around on the season was the best in the WCC as he scored in double figures in all but four games. He ranked sixth in the league in shooting percentage (51.2) and was second in the league in offensive rebounds (2.82). On 18 December 2004, Knight exploded for the Lions in win over San Diego State to become the first Lion to score 30 points in a regular season game since January 1998. Knight finished with 30 points on 13-of-21 shooting, going 4-of-4 from the free throw line while adding a then career-high nine rebounds. Junior year As a junior in 2005‚Äì06, Knight was a Player of the Year candidate in the West Coast Conference and earned first-team All-WCC honours. He ranked seventh in the WCC at 16.2 points per game and led the WCC in rebounds at 10.0 per game. During the season, he became just the 11th player in LMU history to record 1,000 career points and 500 career rebounds. He scored in double figures in every WCC game and had a career-best 32 points and 18 rebounds against Long Beach State on 30 November 2006. Senior year Prior to the 2006‚Äì07 season, the Lions were picked by many to challenge for the WCC title, but their season was filled with near misses (losing to Long Beach State on a half court shot at the buzzer and three other WCC games on shots at the buzzer), critical injuries (Brandon Worthy out with ACL), uphill battles (starting 1‚Äì6 in the WCC) and bad luck (drawing host team in first round) that proved too much for the sixth-seeded Lions as they finish 13‚Äì18 on the year. Their season ended with a loss to the University of Portland at the Chiles Center in the first round of the West Coast Conference Championships. In his final game for LMU, Knight recorded 15 points and seven rebounds. He finished his career with 1,466 points and 743 rebounds, ranking 10th and sixth, respectively. He became the fifth player in LMU history to rank in the top-10 in career points and rebounds. Over 28 games as a senior in 2006‚Äì07, Knight averaged 16.5 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.1 steals per game. He subsequently earned first-team All-WCC honours for the second straight year. Knight's four-year career at LMU was defined by the double-double. He earned his 25th double- double with 20 points and 10 rebounds against Santa Clara on 27 January 2007. Overall, he had two as a sophomore in 2004‚Äì05, broke out for 17 in 2005‚Äì06, and then six as a senior for 25 total, replacing Ime Oduok for fifth all-time in LMU history. His 17 as a junior was the most since Hank Gathers had 26 in the 1988‚Äì89 season and ranked him seventh all-time for single season double- doubles. Professional career West Sydney Razorbacks / Sydney Spirit (2007‚Äì2009) In May and June 2007, Knight had his sights set on entering the NBA and even had a work-out with the Los Angeles Clippers. However, he went undrafted in the 2007 NBA draft and subsequently switched his attention to Australia's National Basketball League (NBL). Knight and his long-time teammate and friend, Damian Martin, both joined Rob Beveridge at the West Sydney Razorbacks for the 2007‚Äì08 NBL season. In his rookie season, Knight appeared in 25 of the team's 30 games and averaged 12.0 points, 8.6 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game. He also recorded six double-doubles. The Razorbacks finished the regular season in 10th spot on the ladder, missing the playoffs with a 10‚Äì20 win/loss record. For the 2008‚Äì09 season, the Razorbacks were renamed the Sydney Spirit in a bid to broaden their supporter base after the collapse of the Sydney Kings. Knight, Martin and Beveridge continued on with the Spirit, but financial difficulties soon besieged the club mid-season. After team owner Greg Evans was served a default notice, all players were asked to take a 50 per cent pay cut. This led to the league having to step in and provide assistance in order for the club to play out the season. With the subsequent departure of Julian Khazzouh and import Derrick Low, the Spirit stumbled through the season and finished with an 11‚Äì19 record, missing the playoffs with an eighth-place finish. Despite the struggles of the Spirit both on and off the court, Knight managed to have a very productive season, averaging 16.6 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game, as he played and started in every game throughout the season. For his efforts, he earned NBL Most Improved Player honours and was named in the All-NBL third team. He also finished second in MVP voting. Hungary (2009‚Äì2010) Following the conclusion of the 2008‚Äì09 NBL season, Knight joined Hungarian club Kecskem√©ti KSE. In six games for the club between March 14 and April 18, Knight averaged 16.2 points, 7.0 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.7 steals per game. In August 2009, Knight signed a one-year deal with Soproni KC, returning to Hungary for a second stint. In March 2010, he was named an International All-Star and played in the league's all-star game against the national team of Hungary. He went on to lead Soproni to a playoff berth, but they were knocked out in the first round by K√∂rmend, losing the series 3‚Äì0. In 27 games (24 regular season, three playoff) for the club in 2009‚Äì10, Knight averaged 15.9 points, 7.9 rebounds and 1.7 steals per game. Perth Wildcats (2010‚Äì2017) On 7 April 2010, Knight signed a three-year deal with the Perth Wildcats, returning to the NBL after one season in Hungary. He was lured to the club by his Sydney Spirit comrades, Damian Martin and Rob Beveridge, with the pair coming off an NBL championship with the Wildcats in 2009‚Äì10. Upon moving to Perth, Knight joined the Rockingham Flames of the State Basketball League (SBL) and had a three-game stint with the club in mid-July. =2010‚Äì11 season= Knight's debut season for the Wildcats began positively before a left calf injury suffered on 12 December 2010 against the Melbourne Tigers ruled him out for two months. Further injuries to Jesse Wagstaff and Shawn Redhage threw the Wildcats' season into disarray as they stumbled through the regular season with inadequate injury replacements. Knight returned to action on 11 February 2011 and helped the team reach the playoffs with a fourth-place finish and a 16‚Äì12 record. In their semi-final series against the first-seeded New Zealand Breakers, the Wildcats took Game 1 in Auckland, but then lost Games 2 and 3 to bow out of the playoffs with a 2‚Äì1 defeat. In 18 games for the Wildcats in 2010‚Äì11, Knight averaged 12.4 points, 6.7 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game. Following the 2010‚Äì11 NBL season, Knight returned to the SBL and joined the Willetton Tigers. He was a dominant force for the Tigers over his first seven games, but in his eighth appearance for the club on 17 June, he suffered a slight calf strain to the same calf he tore on 12 December 2010. The strain ruled him out for a month of action, as he returned to the line-up on 16 July for a four-minute stint. In nine games for the Tigers in 2011, Knight averaged 18.9 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.1 steals per game. =2011‚Äì12 season= Knight was relatively injury free in 2011‚Äì12 and was able to lead the Wildcats to a second-place finish with a 19‚Äì9 win/loss record. After defeating the Gold Coast Blaze 2‚Äì1 in the semi-finals, the Wildcats moved on to the Grand Final series where they faced the New Zealand Breakers. They lost Game 1 in Auckland but were able to tie the series at 1‚Äì1 with a Game 2 victory in Perth, leaving the series to a Game 3 decider in Auckland. In a tightly fought game, the Wildcats went down to the Breakers 79‚Äì73, finishing runners-up with a 2‚Äì1 defeat. In 29 games for the Wildcats in 2011‚Äì12, Knight averaged 10.8 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game. =2012‚Äì13 season: All-NBL First Team= After undergoing off-season shoulder surgery, Knight entered the 2012‚Äì13 season with the mindset of wanting to be the dominant big guy in the NBL. During pre-season, Rob Beveridge made it clear that Knight was going to be the team's go-to guy in the paint in 2012‚Äì13. Knight embraced the responsibility that came with being the team's primary focus under the basket, and excelled in the Wildcats' season-opening win over the New Zealand Breakers, earning the NBL's Player of the Week award for a 20-point, nine-rebound effort. He went on to lead the Wildcats to a 22‚Äì6 win/loss record, good for second behind their arch rivals the Breakers, who amassed just three losses on the season. After sweeping the Wollongong Hawks in the semi-finals, the Wildcats returned to the Grand Final series where they again faced the Breakers ‚Äì their third time facing the Breakers in a playoff series in as many years. However, with the team missing Damian Martin through injury, the Wildcats stumbled to a 2‚Äì0 defeat, as the Breakers claimed their third championship in a row, winning Game 2 in Perth at Perth Arena. Despite another disappointing end to a good overall season, Knight picked up numerous accolades for the 2012‚Äì13 season, including finishing runner-up for the Wildcats MVP, being named in the All-NBL first team and voted as the starting centre in the All-Star game, reaffirming his status as the league's premier big man. In 27 games for the Wildcats in 2012‚Äì13, he averaged 13.7 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. =2013‚Äì14 season: First Championship= On 5 May 2013, Knight re-signed with the Wildcats on a three-year deal. The Wildcats went through many changes during the 2013 off-season with the departure of Rob Beveridge, Kevin Lisch and Cameron Tovey, and the additions of Trevor Gleeson as head coach, and two new imports in Jermaine Beal and James Ennis. This trio brought a new look to the Wildcats, as Beal and Ennis added speed and athleticism to a formidable line-up that still included Martin, Redhage and Wagstaff. Injuries to Knight, however, tarnished his season as he was unable to compete early on (the Wildcats began the season 8‚Äì0) and forced the club to sign Jarrad Prue and Jeremiah Trueman as short-term injury replacements in October and January, respectively. Knight's prolonged absence did not slow down the Wildcats, as the team was able to finish on top of the ladder with a 21‚Äì7 record, booking themselves a spot in the post-season for a 28th straight season. After sweeping the Wollongong Hawks in the semi-finals for the second straight season, the Wildcats returned to the Grand Final for the third year in a row. This time, however, they faced the Adelaide 36ers. After two tightly fought contests in Games 1 and 2, the series was tied a 1‚Äì1. In Game 3 in Perth, the Wildcats thrashed the 36ers with a 93‚Äì59 victory that saw the Wildcats claim their sixth NBL championship, as Knight claimed his first title. In 18 games for the Wildcats in 2013‚Äì14, he averaged 10.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game. =2014‚Äì15 season= On 16 November 2014, Knight played his 100th game for the Wildcats in an 85‚Äì66 win over the Sydney Kings. In 30 minutes of action, he recorded 16 points and eight rebounds. On 9 January 2015, he was ruled out for six weeks with a toe injury. After missing six games, he returned to action earlier than expected, suiting up on 1 February against Sydney. The 2014‚Äì15 season turned out to be a near carbon copy of the 2010‚Äì11 season for the Wildcats as they finished fourth on the ladder with a 16‚Äì12 record and were knocked out in the semi-finals by the Cairns Taipans, failing to defend their 2013‚Äì14 title in a season that was plagued with injuries. In 24 games for the Wildcats in 2014‚Äì15, Knight averaged 10.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game. He subsequently earned All-NBL second team honours. =2015‚Äì16 season: Second Championship= For the first time in his Wildcats career, Knight had an injury-free season in 2015‚Äì16. With the team's acquisition of Nathan Jawai, Knight was able to move to his natural position of power forward. Knight, Jawai and Tom Jervis proved to be a formidable front court, as the Wildcats battled with Melbourne United for top spot on the ladder all season. The Wildcats finished the regular season in second spot with an 18‚Äì10 record, and in the semi-finals, they faced the Rob Beveridge-led Illawarra Hawks. After defeating the Hawks 2‚Äì1, the Wildcats once again faced the New Zealand Breakers in the Grand Final, however, this time with home court advantage. Home court proved to be vital as the Wildcats won Game 1 in Perth, lost Game 2 in Auckland, and then came out victorious with a 75‚Äì52 thrashing of the Breakers in Game 3 to claim their seventh NBL championship and second in three years, defeating the Breakers for the first time in the playoffs. Knight appeared in 33 of the team's 34 games in 2015‚Äì16, averaging 11.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game. At the conclusion of the regular season, Knight was named in the All-NBL second team for the second straight year. =2016‚Äì17 season: Third Championship= Knight (right) signing autographs alongside Matthew Nielsen at the 2017 Perth Wildcats championship ceremony On 19 April 2016, Knight re-signed with the Wildcats on a two-year deal, a month after undergoing shoulder stabilisation surgery on his left arm. Unfortunately, injury struck down Knight again during the 2016 off-season. On 12 September 2016, he was ruled out for two months after suffering a subluxation of his right shoulder during training a week earlier. However, the joint responded well to rehab and after a week of full training with the team, Wildcats medical staff gave him the all-clear on 20 October 2016. He made his season debut the following day, recording 12 points and eight rebounds in an 80‚Äì73 win over the Illawarra Hawks. On 13 November, he had a season-best game with 24 points and 13 rebounds in an 87‚Äì86 overtime loss to the New Zealand Breakers. After averaging 13 points per game over his first eight games, Knight's form began to decline in December as he scored in double figures just three times over the next 14 games. He also had only one double-digit rebounding game during that stretch. In the Wildcats' regular season finale on 12 February 2017, Knight had his best game since late November with a double- double of 15 points and 10 rebounds to help lead the Wildcats to a 96‚Äì94 win over Melbourne United in Melbourne. The win propelled the Wildcats into their 31st consecutive NBL Finals appearance, as they finished the regular season in third place with a 15‚Äì13 record. Knight helped the Wildcats win through to another NBL Grand Final after sweeping the second-seeded Cairns Taipans in the semi-finals. In Game 1 of the best-of-five grand final series, Knight scored 18 points to help lift the Wildcats to an 89‚Äì77 win over the Illawarra Hawks. In Game 2 of the series, Knight had to be helped off the court after seemingly innocuous contact from teammate Casey Prather early in the third quarter. He was subsequently ruled out of Game 3. Despite being without Knight, the Wildcats successfully defended their title with a 3‚Äì0 series sweep. It marked the Wildcats' eighth championship and Knight's third. Knight appeared in 27 of the team's 33 games, averaging 9.4 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game. Knight sustained two head knocks over the last month of the 2016‚Äì17 NBL season, both of which resulted in him being unable to complete the game and missing a subsequent contest. Wildcats managing director Nick Marvin acknowledged that the club would consult with Knight during the 2017 off- season, with six concussion-related incidents in six years raising concerns over his long-term health. =2017‚Äì18 season: Retirement brought forward= On 1 July 2017, Knight revealed that the 2017‚Äì18 NBL season would be his last. After battling shoulder problems and concussion in 2016‚Äì17, Knight had hoped to avoid more injuries in his final season. However, on 13 September 2017, he was ruled out for the remainder of the club's pre-season games with a thumb injury. The injury occurred in the Wildcats' opening game of the NBL Blitz. Scans revealed a small fracture and ligament damage in his right thumb, with Wildcats medical staff opting to take a non-surgical approach to repairing the injury. The injury-prone Knight suffered head knocks against Brisbane and Cairns early in the season, but concerns for his future were only fully taken into account following another head knock that came accidentally at training on 30 October. As a result, Knight brought forward his retirement plans, calling time on his 236-game NBL career on 6 November 2017. He finished his career with 2,800 points and 1,646 rebounds. Personal On 2 December 2013, Knight and his partner Sherelle had their first child, a daughter named Mia Rose. He later married Sherelle in September 2014. In 2013, Knight considered a switch to Australian Rules football in order to follow in his father's footsteps after attracting interest from WAFL club West Perth.

OX1001 is a nitrate ester analog of the approved HIV protease inhibitor, saquinavir. This modification increases the anti-cancer property while decreasing toxicity of the drug. OX1001 shows broad activity against cancer cells but is particularly effective against hematological, prostate, and melanoma cancers as seen in in vitro and in vivo studies.  Mechanism of action  OX1001 is an analog of the already approved HIV protease inhibitor, saquinavir. HIV protease inhibitor drugs not only work against HIV, but they also have proved function in anti-cancer therapy. However, these drugs tend to have many toxic effects. Adding a nitrate ester functional group to HIV protease inhibitors has been found to curb these negative effects as well as increase the anti-tumor properties of the drug. Because OX1001 is still in pre-clinical testing, its mechanism of action is unclear. However, it can be said that as opposed to saquinavir, OX1001 likely works by slowing the growth rate of tumor cells rather than by causing apoptosis, or cell death. Studies suggest that this stoppage of cell proliferation is permanent. Though the difference between OX1001 and saquinavir lies in the presence of a nitrate ester, it is not clear how exactly this modification directly affects the function of the drug. It can be hypothesized that the presence of the nitrate ester plays a role in inhibiting the activity of cytochrome P450, which is an enzyme that normally deactivates saquinavir. Aside from having superior anti- tumor properties, OX1001 also has a much lower toxicity profile than saquinavir. In one experiment, it was determined that at a dose where Saquinavir produced 100% toxicity, OX1001 showed no signs of inducing any toxicity. This might be due to the drug‚Äôs ability to produce a powerful, yet short-lived stimulus to normal cells‚Äô Akt signaling pathways which protects them.

After The Little Review published the \\"Nausicaa\\" episode of Ulysses in the April 1920 issue of the magazine, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice instigated obscenity charges against Little Review editors Margaret Caroline Anderson and Jane Heap. The editors were found guilty under laws associated with the Comstock Act of 1873, which made it illegal to circulate materials deemed obscene in the U.S. mail. Anderson and Heap incurred a $100 fine, and were forced to cease publishing Ulysses in The Little Review.  Precedents in obscenity law The legal concepts of obscenity underpinning Anderson and Heap's trial go back to a standard first established in the 1868 English case of Regina v. Hicklin.Pagnattaro 218 In this case, Lord Chief Justice Cockburn defined the \\"test of obscenity\\" as \\"whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.\\"qtd. in Pagnattaro 218 This standard, known as the Hicklin test, went on to influence American jurisprudence, first in United States v. Bennett (1879), upholding a court charge based upon the Hicklin obscenity test and allowing the test to be applied to passages of a text and not necessarily a text in its entirety.Pagnattaro 219 Following this, the Hicklin test was endorsed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Rosen v. United States (1896) and was adhered to by American courts well into the twentieth century.de Grazia 12 In 1873, after the lobbying attempts of Anthony Comstock, head of New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, the U.S. Congress amended a pre-existing law and enacted the Comstock Act, which made it a crime to knowingly mail obscene materials or advertisements and information about obscene materials, abortion, or contraception.de Grazia 4 This act adopted the Hicklin test for deeming which materials would be considered obscene.  Background  Margaret Anderson, one of the defendants (1953 photo) John Sumner, instigator of, and witness for, the prosecution (1915 photo) The U.S. Post Office confiscated the October 1917 issue of The Little Review due to the publication of Wyndham Lewis' story \\"Cantleman's Springmate\\", which focuses on a young, disillusioned soldier who, while awaiting deployment to the front lines of World War I, seduces a young girl and afterwards ignores her letters informing him of her pregnancy.Baggett, 176 The story was seized due to its perceived sexual lewdness and anti-war sentiments which were thought to violate the Comstock laws prohibiting \\"obscene, lewd, or lascivious\\" material from being mailed.Baggett 176 John Quinn, a successful lawyer and patron of the arts who was benefactor to both The Little Review and Ezra Pound,de Grazia 8 the magazine's foreign editor at the time, believed the magazine to have been suppressed due to editors Anderson and Heap's support of anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman and anti-war statements they published in New York newspapers.Baggett 177 Their support of radical political figures had already led to their eviction from their New York studio office. Following this suppression, it was difficult for Anderson and Heap to find a New York printer willing to print episodes of Ulysses. When they found a printer, The Little Review began its serialization of Ulysses, publishing the first episode from the work in March, 1918. Following this first publication of Ulysses, three issues of The Little Review were seized and burnt by the U.S. Post Office on the grounds that its prose was deemed 'obscene'. The January 1919 issue which contained the \\"Lestrygonians\\" episode of Ulysses was the first that was seized; the May 1919, which contained \\"Scylla and Charybdis,\\" was second; and the January 1920 issue, which contained the \\"Cyclops\\" episode, was third.de Grazia 14 In 1920, a New York attorney whose daughter had received an unsolicited copy of The Little Review issue brought it to the attention of John S. Sumner, secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice.Marek 87Ellman (1982), pp. 502‚Äì04 Sumner lodged a complaint that September, and on October 4 Anderson and Heap were arrested and charged with obscenity for publishing \\"Nausicaa\\" in the April 1920 issue of The Little Review.\\"Ulysses, Episode XIII\\", The Little Review Vol. VI, No. 11, p. 42. April 1920. This episode was an account of protagonist Leopold Bloom fantasizing about a young girl named Gerty MacDowell who leans back to expose herself to Bloom. The scene culminates in Bloom's orgasm, which legal historian Edward de Grazia, in Girls Lean Back Everywhere, argues would have likely escaped the average reader's notice due to Joyce's metaphorical language.de Grazia 9-10  Trial  The trial was held in February 1921 before three judges in a court of special sessions. It solely considered the \\"Nausicaa\\" episode of Ulysses, with particular attention on Bloom's orgasm and Gerty's role as co-actor.Baggett 182 The prosecutor was Joseph Forrester, Assistant District Attorney, and his only witness was John Sumner.Birmingham, pp. 188, 192 John Quinn represented Anderson and Heap, though both disagreed with him over which approach would make the most appropriate defence. Quinn maintained that Anderson and Heap should remain quiet and not testify, so as to present themselves as modest, inconspicuous and conservative women.Anderson 219 Though not required by law, Quinn decided to produce three literary experts to attest to the literary merits of Ulysses, as well as The Little Reviews broader reputation.de Grazia 10 The first expert witness was Philip Moeller, of the Theatre Guild, who interpreted Ulysses using the Freudian method of unveiling the subconscious mind, which prompted one of the judges to ask him to \\"speak in a language that the court could understand\\".Anderson 220 The next witness was Scofield Thayer, editor of The Dial, another literary magazine of the time, who \\"was forced to admit that if he had had the desire to publish Ulysses he would have consulted a lawyer first‚Äîand not published it\\". The final witness was English novelist, lecturer, and critic John Cowper Powys, who declared that Ulysses was a \\"beautiful piece of work in no way capable of corrupting the minds of young girls\\". During the trial, the assistant district attorney announced that he would read the offending passage aloud to the court, a proposition to which one judge objected. The judge believed such indecent material \\"should not be read in the presence of a young woman such as Anderson\\".Baggett 185 In her autobiography, My Thirty Years' War, Anderson writes: \\"regarding me with protective paternity, [the judge] refused to allow the obscenity to be read in my hearing\\".Anderson 221 When it was pointed out to the judge that Anderson was the publisher, he declared that he was sure \\"she didn't know the significance of what she was publishing\\". Following this, the offending passage of Ulysses was read aloud, and the court recessed for one week so that judges could read the entire \\"Nausicaa\\" episode. Quinn's argument against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed to be acquainted with the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce's poor eyesight. At one point in the trial Quinn confessed that \\"I myself do not understand Ulysses‚ÄîI think Joyce has carried his method too far,\\" whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, \\"Yes, it sounds to me like the ravings of a disordered mind‚ÄîI can't see why anyone would want to publish it\\".\\"Ulysses in Court\\" 22 In accordance with obscenity precedents set by United States v. Bennett, the panel of three judges decided that the passages from the \\"Nausicaa\\" episode did indeed constitute obscenity and thereby violated the Comstock laws.Pagnattaro 223 Anderson and Heap were found guilty of the charge of obscenity and were forced to discontinue publishing any further episodes from Ulysses, have their fingerprints taken, and pay a fine of one hundred dollars.Baggett 183  Aftermath and responses  The Little Review ceased its serialization of Ulysses, with \\"Nausicaa\\" being the last episode of the novel to be featured in the magazine. Anderson and Heap were required to restrict the magazine's content to less inflammatory material, eventually removing their motto \\"Making No Compromise with the Public Taste\\" from the magazine's cover page in 1921. Disheartened by the trial, the lack of support from the intellectual community, and the future outlook for art in America, Anderson considered ceasing to publish The Little Review, and eventually ceded control of the magazine to Heap.Lappin 8 The Little Review went on to be published until 1929. In her article \\"Art and the Law,\\" written after being served with obscenity allegations but before the ensuing trial, Heap pointed out the irony of being prosecuted for printing the thoughts of the character Gerty MacDowell, \\"an innocent, simple, childish girl,\\" in attempts to protect the minds of young women.Heap 6 Heap first asks \\"If the young girl corrupts, can she also be corrupted?\\" and goes on to quip, \\"If there is anything I really fear it is the mind of the young girl\\". She also argued that: > Mr. Joyce was not teaching early Egyptian perversions nor inventing new > ones. Girls lean back everywhere, showing lace and silk stockings; wear low- > cut sleeveless blouses, breathless bathing suits; men think thoughts and > have emotions about these things everywhere‚Äîseldom as delicately and > imaginatively as Mr. Bloom‚Äîand no one is corrupted. Can merely reading about > the thoughts he thinks corrupt a man when his thoughts do not? Although the trial was ostensibly concerned with the \\"Nausicaa\\" episode, a number of scholars, such as Holly Baggett, Jane Marek and Adam Parkes, argue that it was motivated against the iconoclastic character of the magazine and its \\"politically radical lesbian\\" editors.Baggett 169Marek 90Parkes 284 Though Quinn defended Anderson and Heap in the trial, in his letters to Ezra Pound, Quinn expressed distaste for his defendants. In a letter from October 16, 1920 Quinn wrote, \\"I have no interest at all in defending people who are stupidly and brazenly and Sapphoistically and pederastically and urinally, and menstrually violat[ing] the law, and think they are courageous\\".qtd. in Baggett 180 Anderson and Heap faced not only a hostile prosecution and judges indifferent to the literary merits of Ulysses, but also a defence attorney who, in some ways, sided with the prosecution.Baggett 181 In Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity: A Cultural Biography, Irene Gammel argues that the trial was ultimately a battle over women's issues and the paternalist functions of obscenity laws at the time .Gammel 253 Gammel asserts that Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, a prolific contributor of poetry to The Little Review, became the magazine's figurehead in a fight for authority in determining the subject matter women should be able to write about and read. Gammel writes, \\"If Heap was the field marshall for The Little Review's vanguard battle against puritan conventions and traditional sexual aesthetics, then the Baroness was to become its fighting machine\\".Gammel 240 Though effectively banned in the United States, Ulysses was published by Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922, one year after the trial. Not until the 1933 case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses could the novel be published in the United States without fear of prosecution.Pagnattaro 232  Notes   References  *Anderson, Margaret C. \\"'Ulysses' in Court.\\" The Little Review Jan-Mar. 1921: 22-25.

The shrine is considered to be the earliest example of Tughluq architecture, and is one of the most impressive shrines in the Indian subcontinent. The shrine attracts over 100,000 pilgrims to the annual urs festival that commemorates his death. Location The tomb is located in the ancient city of Multan, in central Pakistan. The tomb is situated at the northwestern edge of the Multan Fort.  History  The tomb was built between 1320 and 1324 CE by Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq in the pre-Mughal architectural style. The tomb is considered the earliest example of Tughluq architecture, and pre-dates Tughluq monuments in Delhi. The tomb was built when Ghiyath al-Din served as governor of Dipalpur, and likely was intended to serve as a tomb for himself, before he became Emperor of the Delhi Sultanate. Rukn-e-Alam had initially been buried in the Shrine of Bahauddin Zakariya, however, the present tomb was gifted by Muhammad bin Tughluq to the descendants of Rukn-e-Alam, who had his remains interred in the shrine in 1330. Layout The shrine's layout is typical of Suhrawadi tombs, with three entrances, a western-facing mihrab, and an original main entrance on the southern axis that featured a small vestibule. The main entrance has since been shifted to the east, in an attempt to align the shrine's axises with Mecca, in accordance with orthodox interpretations of Islam.  Architecture  The mausoleum features buttresses in each of its 8 corners, and incorporates elements of Tughluq military architecture. The masuoleum decorative elements. Multan had strong links to Persia and Afghanistan - links which are reflected in the heavy influence of Central Asian and Persian architectural styles found at the tomb, such as the use of brick, glazed tiles, and wooden roofs. The shrine represents the culmination of Multani funerary architecture that began with the Shrine of Khalid Walid near Kabirwala.  Mausoleum  The mausoleum is a three-tiered structure. Though the second octagonal tier is typical of Multan, the first tier in the shape of an octagon differs from the nearby Shrine of Bahauddin Zakariya and other earlier shrines which rests upon a square shaped base. The first tier is 15 metres in diameter, and features walls 4 feet thick. The first tier features bands of timber that create a visual break in the exterior brickwork. The octagonal first tier is buttressed by small minaret-shaped towers in each of its 8 corners that provide support to the structure, and narrow as they rise and surpass the height of the first tier. A second octagon rests upon the first tier that features small domes in each of the eight corners of the building. A third tier rests above the second, and is formed by a dome of 15 metres in diameter. The entire structure is 35 metres tall, with sloping walls. The dome is capped by a structure similar to an amalaka found on Hindu temples. Decorative elements The mausoleum is built entirely of red brick, bounded with beams of shisham wood, which have turned black over the centuries. The exterior is elaborately ornamented with carved wooden panels, carved brick, string-courses and battlements. Buttresses, turrets, and crenellations at the top of the shrine reflect the influence of Tughluq military architecture on even non-military buildings. The exterior is further embellished with regional-style tile-work in floral, arabesque, and geometric motifs with dark blue, azure, and white tiles - all of which contrast the deep red finely polished bricks. The white dome is decorated with blue tile-work along its lower perimeter. Interior Shah Rukn-e-Alam's grave is surrounded by 72 graves of his descendants and devotees. The shrine's vast interior features no internal buttresses, nor any interior structural elements to support the interior space, which results in a vast interior space. The interior was initially decorated with elaborate tile work, which was subsequently covered in plaster, though vast interior of the mausoleum is now largely bare. Niches at the ground level serve to enlarge the interior space further. The carved wooden mihrab is considered to be one of the earliest examples of its genre. The sarcophagus of Rukn-e-Alam is slightly off-centre, and is surrounded by the graves of 72 of his relatives, which allude to the 72 martyred companions of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson, Imam Hussein, at the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE. Conservation In the 1970s, the mausoleum was thoroughly repaired and renovated by the Auqaf Department. The entire glittering glazed interior is the result of new tiles and brickwork done by the Kashigars, or tile makers, of Multan.http://www.heritage.gov.pk/html_Pages/historic_multan.htm Historic Multan The tomb is on the tentative list as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1884/ Sunlight kissing the front of the Tomb Gallery File:Close up detail of the facade of the tomb of shah rukn e alam.jpgDetail of the shrine's carved brickwork File:Shah Rukn-e- Alam Tomb.jpgThe shrine is illuminated at night Image:Rukn-e-Alam Tomb Multan 1865.jpgThe tomb in 1865 File:Shah_Rukn-e-Alam_inside.jpgUnderside of the shrine's dome File:Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam Inside View.JPGDevotees inside the shrine File:Shah_Rukn-e-Alam2.jpgExternal view of the shrine File:Tomb_of_Shah_Rukn-e-Alam_3.jpgThe shrine's exterior is embellished with a variety of decorative elements File:Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam, Multan 2013 8.jpgA view of the shrine from its courtyard  References   External links  * Buildings and structures in Multan Tourist attractions in Multan Sufi shrines in Pakistan Ziyarat People from Multan Punjabi Sufis ","title":"Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam"},{"id":"41246804","text":"Oxyyttropyrochlore-(Y) (obruchevite) Oxyyttropyrochlore-(Y),Mindat also referred to as \\"obruchevite\\" or \\"yttropyrochlore-(Y)\\", is a potential (not yet accepted) zero-valent-dominant mineral of the pyrochlore group.

She made nearly 70 films between 1912 and her early death in 1917. Early life and career Batley was born in December 1876 in Wigan, northwest England, the second daughter of an iron merchant. In the late 1890s, she travelled to London to work as a theatre actress, performing under the name Ethyle Gordon Murray. While working with a touring theatre company, Murray met Ernest Batley, an actor from East London. They were married on 22 June 1901 at a registry office ceremony in Wandsworth, and began their married life living in Battersea. In 1902, Ernest and Ethyle had their first child, actress Dorothy Audrey Batley, who was born on 18 January. Film career Ethyle's first directing credit was in October 1912, with the film Peggy Gets Rid of the Baby, which starred Dorothy in the lead role. During the First World War, Batley was one of the most active directors of patriotic films. Legacy Batley's contribution to the early history of cinema in Britain has often been overlooked or understated. In 2009, film historian Gerry Turvey described her as a \\"unique figure\\" who \\"merits fuller recognition than she has so far received\\".

After the war ended in 1918, he became interested in aviation, and in 1922 he qualified as a pilot. He transferred to the Regia Aeronautica (Italy's Royal Air Force) when it was created in 1923 and earned a reputation as a skilled navigator.Sircana, Giuseppe (1990). Del Prete, Carlo\\".

Del Prete helped Pinedo prepare for a six-month Rome-Australia-Tokyo- Rome flight Pinedo made with mechanic Ernesto Campanelli in 1925.  Record flights   1927 \\"Four Continents\\" flight  In 1927, Del Prete joined Pinedo and mechanic Vitale Zacchetti in flying the Savoia-Marchetti S.55 flying boat Santa Maria under Pinedo's command on the \\"Four Continents\\" flight, intended to take them from Italy to Africa and across the Atlantic Ocean to Brazil, followed by several stops in South America and the Caribbean, a tour of the United States and Canada, and a transatlantic flight back to Europe ultimately ending in Rome. Leaving Cagliari, Sardinia, on 13 February 1927, they stopped at Villa Cisneros in Spanish Sahara and Bolama in Portuguese Guinea before attempting to take off from Bolama on 16 February to cross the Atlantic Ocean to Brazil. Sweltering conditions prevented their plane from becoming airborne until they dumped a large quantity of gasoline, forcing them to fly to the Cape Verde Islands instead, where cooler conditions prevailed. On 23 February, they finally made their Atlantic crossing, braving a storm and landing on the ocean near Fernando de Noronha, where the Brazilian Navy protected cruiser met them and towed them into port. The next day, after repairs necessitated by a collision with Almirante Barroso, they flew to Natal, Brazil, to begin the South American phase of the flight.Anonymous, \\"Pinedo's Big Flight,\\" Flight, February 27, 1927, p. 87. After stops at various cities in South America including Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Montevideo, Uruguay, and Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, the three Italians began a long leg over the dense jungle of Brazil's Mato Grosso region on 16 March 1927. At one point, a Brazilian river boat had to tow the Santa Maria for 200 miles (322 kilometers) along the Paraguay River in search of a suitable takeoff area after a refueling stop, but on 20 March they completed their crossing of the Mato Grosso and landed at Mana√≥s, Brazil. It was history's first flight over the Mato Grosso. After a stop at Georgetown, British Guiana, and a crossing of the Caribbean with stops at Pointe-√†-Pitre in Guadeloupe, Port-au-Prince in Haiti, and Havana in Cuba, Pinedo, Del Prete, and Zacchetti crossed the Gulf of Mexico and arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 29 March 1927, the first time in history that a foreign airplane had flown into the United States. They then flew through Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, intending to reach San Diego, California, but during a refueling stop on Theodore Roosevelt Lake in Arizona an accidental fire broke out and destroyed their plane; its engines sank 60 feet (18 meters) to the bottom of the lake and were not recovered until 19 April. The three Italians then flew to San Diego as passengers on a United States Navy plane and traveled by train to New York City, where they arrived on 26 April 1927 to meet a new S.55 shipped there by the Italian Fascist government so that they could continue their flight. The new plane ‚Äì identical to the Santa Maria ‚Äì arrived in New York by ship on 1 May 1927, and, after reassembly, was christened Santa Maria II on 8 May. Following a revised schedule that eliminated all stops west of the Mississippi River, Pinedo, Del Prete, and Zacchetti visited Boston, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Charleston, South Carolina; Pensacola, Florida; and New Orleans before setting out on 14 March 1927 northward up the Mississippi River into the Midwestern United States. They stopped at Memphis, Tennessee, flew over St. Louis, Missouri, and stopped at Chicago, Illinois. They then flew into Canada, stopping at Montreal on 17 March 1927 after an 11-hour flight from Chicago. Pinedo, Del Prete, and Zacchetti flew on to the Dominion of Newfoundland. On 22 May, they departed Trepassey Bay, planning to cross the Atlantic to the Azores, refuel, and then fly on to Portugal, retracing the transatlantic route of the United States Navy Curtiss NC-4 flying boat in 1919, but they ran low on fuel due to unfavorable weather. Pinedo was forced to land the Santa Maria II on the ocean and be taken under tow by a Portuguese fishing boat and an Italian steamer for the final 200 miles (322 km) to the Azores, where the plane arrived at Horta on May 30.Anonymous, \\"Pinedo's Progress,\\" Flight, June 2, 1927, p. 360. After a week of repairs, the three Italian aviators were airborne again, flying back to the point in the Atlantic where they had been taken under tow, and then finishing their transatlantic flight from there. After stops in Portugal and Spain, Pinedo, Del Prete, and Zacchetti completed the \\"Four Continents\\" flight on 16 June 1927, landing Santa Maria II in Ostia's harbor outside Rome.

Crossing the Brazilian coast near Natal, they continued south, hoping to reach Rio de Janeiro. However, poor weather forced the aviators to turn back towards Natal. Now running low on fuel and with the weather still against them, they were forced to abandon landing there as well, since the aerodrome lay behind a row of hills. Instead, they continued north for another 160 km (100 mi) and made a forced landing on a beach at Touros.Ferrante 2004, p.113 During the flight from Italy, the S.64 had covered 8,100 km (5,030 mi) in 48 hours, 14 minutes.

A Brazilian mail plane conveyed Ferrarin and Del Prete first to Natal and then to Rio de Janeiro, where in both cities they were given a heroes' welcome. The S.64 suffered structural damage during its landing on the sand, and was brought to Rio de Janeiro by ship. When it arrived in the city, it was donated to Brazil. Death The festivities in Rio de Janeiro continued for weeks, but came to an end when Ferrarin and Del Prete crashed during a demonstration flight in a Savoia-Marchetti SM.62 on 11 August 1928.

Existing Monroeville business loop U.S. Route 22 Business is a 5-mile loop through the eastern Pittsburgh suburbs of Churchill, Wilkins Township, and Monroeville, Pennsylvania, on William Penn Highway. The route's western terminus is at a freeway junction with Interstate 376, which features a concurrency by the business loop's parent route. The route was the former pathway of U.S. Route 22 itself before the construction that extended Interstate 376 from this point eastward to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, in the early 1960s. The first two miles of the road are contained in a valley, surrounded by a variety of side roads leading to suburban, mostly residential development. The remaining three miles feature dense commercial development, including several office high rises and the Monroeville Mall. The highway ends at a complicated junction that features the northern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 48, the southern end of Haymaker Road, and Interstate 376, which features its last two exits (before the Pennsylvania Turnpike) with the above streets. Business US 22 then travels for its final eighth of a mile on a viaduct that allows for connections with the Pennsylvania Turnpike and a smooth transition on to US 22 east (continuing William Penn Highway) toward suburban Murrysville. Major intersections Lewistown business loop U.S. Route 22 Business is a 5-mile loop through Lewistown, Pennsylvania. It serves as the major through street, taking on the former designation of its parent, which has become a freeway bypass. The first two miles of the route travel through rural Granville Township. The middle two mile segment is lined with small development and features several stop lights and a segment that contains a center turning lane. The last two miles wind along the Juniata River toward the eastern freeway juncture. Major intersections Former Green Tree‚ÄìPittsburgh temporary route Pittsburgh truck route Harrisburg bypass route U.S. Route 22 Bypass was a bypass of the routing of US 22 through downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania from the 1930s to 1978. The bypass began at US 22/US 322 (Front Street/2nd Street) along the Susquehanna River and headed east on Maclay Street. Upon intersecting PA 230 (Cameron Street), US 22 Byp. ran southeast on Arsenal Boulevard and east on Herr Street before it reached its eastern terminus at US 22 (Walnut Street) near Penbrook. US 22 Byp. was first designated by 1940 between US 22 and US 230 at the intersection of Cameron and Maclay streets in Harrisburg and US 22 near Penbrook, following Arsenal Boulevard and Herr Street. In the 1940s, US 22 Byp. was extended west along Maclay Street to end at US 22/US 322/PA 14 (Front Street), running concurrent with US 230. In the 1950s, the route east of US 230 became concurrent with US 230 Byp. The US 230 and US 230 Byp. concurrencies were removed during the 1960s. On June 29, 1978, the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials approved the removal of the US 22 Byp. designation; the route was replaced by US 22 along Arsenal Boulevard and Herr Street. ;Major intersections Bethlehem‚ÄìEaston alternate route U.S. Route 22 Alternate was an alternate route of US 22 that ran between the cities of Bethlehem and Easton in Pennsylvania between the 1930s and 1950s. The alternate route began at US 22 and PA 12 at the intersection of Main and Union streets in downtown Bethlehem, heading east on Union Street. The route briefly turned north along Linden Street before it headed east on Goepp Street, which became Pembroke Road as it left Bethlehem. US 22 Alt. became Freemansburg Avenue and passed through Freemansburg. The route continued east to Wilson, where it came to its eastern terminus at US 22 (Butler Street). US 22 Alt. was first designated in the 1930s, beginning at US 22 and PA 12 at the intersection of Main and Goepp streets in Bethlehem and following Goepp Street, Pembroke Road, and Freemansburg Avenue to US 22 at Butler Street in Wilson. In the 1940s, US 22 Alt. was shifted to use Union Street to intersect US 22 and PA 12 in Bethlehem. The US 22 Alt. designation was decommissioned during the 1950s. ;Major intersections Phillipsburg alternate route U.S. Route 22 Alternate was an alternate route of US 22 located in Phillipsburg, New Jersey. The route began at the Northampton Street Bridge over the Delaware River to Easton, Pennsylvania. From here, the alternate route followed South Main Street through Phillipsburg. US 22 Alt. headed into Pohatcong Township and became New Brunswick Avenue. Here, the route formed a short concurrency with CR 519 and continued east to its eastern terminus at US 22. US 22 Alt. was first designated in the 1940s to run along the former alignment of US 22 through Easton and Phillipsburg that was bypassed. The alternate route began at US 22 at the intersection of 7th and Northampton streets in Easton and ran east along Northampton Street to the Northampton Street Bridge into New Jersey. At this point, US 22 Alt. became concurrent with Route 28 and ran through Phillipsburg on South Main Street and Pohatcong Township on New Brunswick Avenue before ending at US 22. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the concurrent Route 28 designation in New Jersey was removed. During the 1950s, the western terminus of US 22 Alt. was moved to the Northampton Street Bridge, with PA 45 replacing the route along Northampton Street in Easton.

Definition and purpose { class=wikitable align=right + Volkswagen logo evolution 64px 64px 64px } Flat design is a style of interface design emphasizing minimalist use of simple elements, typography and flat colors. Designers may prefer flat design because it allows interface designs to be more streamlined and efficient. It is easier to quickly convey information while still looking visually appealing and approachable. Additionally, it makes it easier to design an interface that is responsive to changes in browser size across different devices. With minimal design elements, websites are able to load faster and resize easily, and still look sharp on high-definition screens. As a design approach, it is often contrasted to skeuomorphism and rich design, although flat design can use skeuomorphs just as much as a realistically designed UI. History Flat design is primarily influenced by the International Typographic Style (also known as Swiss Style), Text User Interface, Modernism, and the styles emerging from Bauhaus. The International Typographic style is often considered the most substantial influence on flat design, and its emergence and popularization during the 1950s and 1960s is regarded as the starting point of flat design, although it would not make an appearance in the digital world for some time thereafter. In 2002, Microsoft released Windows Media Center, and in 2006, the Zune MP3 player, both of which contained elements of flat design. The design of the Zune was clean and simple, with a focus on large lowercase typography, silhouette-style logos, and monochromatic font colors. Microsoft continued this style of design with the 2010 release of Windows Phone 7, which built on the flat design elements introduced with the Zune, formalized as the \\"Metro design language\\". The design was dominated by large and bright shapes accompanied by sans-serif typography from the Segoe font family, flat images, and a menu with a grid-like pattern. Metro was subsequently adopted by all Microsoft software lines, including the Windows 8 PC operating system. GUI widgets designed in Google's Material Design style Android began to adopt flat design trends with 4.0 \\"Ice Cream Sandwich\\" in 2011; Matias Duarte, Google's vice president of design, felt that Apple's iOS was too skeuomorphic, Windows Phone looked like \\"airport lavatory signage\\", and that both interfaces were too rigidly standardized with limited flexibility for designers. The platform's new \\"Holo\\" interface was designed to appear more simplistic than past Android versions, with neon-blue accents, hard edges, and drop shadows for depth. In 2013, Apple unveiled iOS 7, which shifted to a flat UI design with use of brighter colors, typography, as well as blurred, translucent overlays. The following year, Mac OS X Yosemite introduced the iOS 7-styled user interface to Apple's Mac OS X operating system. Google began to introduce its own flat design language known as \\"Material Design\\" for Android (beginning on Android Lollipop) and its other platforms, which is based on index card- like sheets and the use of shadows to promote depth and hierarchy, as well as smooth animations and transitions. In 2017, Microsoft unveiled the Fluent Design System, a new flat user interface. This new interface departs from its predecessor, Metro, through the use of depth, interface feedback, and a new translucency effect dubbed \\"Acrylic\\".  Criticism  Flat design has been criticized for making user interfaces unintuitive and less usable. By making all design elements (menus, buttons, links, etc.) flat, distinguishing what function an element serves may become more difficult, for example, determining whether an element is a button or an indicator. Research has shown that flat design is more popular with young adults than older adults. Research also showed that, while young people seem faster at navigating flat designs, they also have trouble with understanding the user interface. In 2013 Jakob Nielsen, an expert in user interface design and usability, dubbed flat design as a \\"threat to tablet usability\\". Nielsen also proposed an alternative, namely a middle-ground between skeuomorphism and flat design.

Plot The entire film happens in a very desolate region of China, in the northwestern deserts. A poacher (Huang Bo) is being arrested by a police officer after capturing a rare falcon, worth 1 million RMB on the black market. A second poacher (Tobgye) kills the police officer with his jeep and tells the first poacher to flee, while he stays behind himself to take responsibility. He hires one of the best lawyers (Xu Zheng) in China for his defense, forcing the lawyer to travel a long distance to get to the town. At the trial, the lawyer gets the poacher acquitted by arguing that the crash happened because the police officer was drunk. The lawyer takes the poacher's car as collateral and begins a long drive back to China's eastern region. While driving, the lawyer is harassed by two people (Wang Shuangbao and Ba Duo) in a truck carrying hay. He throws his lighter at the hay in retaliation, igniting it, and drives ahead. The second poacher was mad at his car being pawned. He arranges for the first poacher to murder the lawyer on the highway. However, by standing in the middle of the road, pretending that he has car problems in an attempt to trick the lawyer into stopping, the first poacher gets crashed into instead. The lawyer puts him in the backseat, along with his bag, and tries to take him to the nearest rest stop, which is a shanty town, to call for help. He does not realize that that man is the first poacher. When he gets to the shantytown, the first poacher looks like he has died. The lawyer gets scared and decides not to call for help. Instead, he buys gasoline and another lighter. He intends to cover up the crash by cremating the poacher's dead body. But it turns out, the first poacher isn't dead, and upon regaining consciousness he holds the lawyer at gunpoint. A girl from the shanty town (Yu Nan) had stowed away in the trunk, trying to start a new life, and also gets threatened. The two truck drivers from earlier come upon them, and the poacher kills one and wounds the other, and proceeds to shoot the lawyer non-fatally. He forces the girl to take the car and drive him to a ghost town further on. The falcon, all along, was being held in his bag, and he has scheduled to sell it there to black marketers. The girl crashes the car by accident. She gets rescued by her abusive father and brother, who kill the first poacher. The father tries to take the falcon to the ghost town and sell it for himself, leaving the girl and her brother. The second poacher, having lost contact with the first, comes upon the lawyer and lets him ride his pickup truck, pretending he will help. He comes upon the girl and her brother and decides to kill the brother, and tries, but fails, to murder the lawyer through carbon monoxide poisoning. He seizes the girl and heads for the ghost town. The lawyer wakes up and is arrested by a single police officer, but he causes the police car to crash and races to save the girl. The second poacher and the two black marketers murder the girl's father at the ghost town, complete their transaction, and try to kill the girl. They are stopped by the lawyer, who approaches and tricks the black marketers into thinking that the second poacher is working with the police. The second poacher is forced to kill both black marketers. He is about to kill the lawyer and the girl, but the surviving truck driver from earlier saves them before getting killed himself. At this point, the lawyer is finally defenseless. He gets dragged by the second poacher into a truck which is holding some barrels, and is forced to watch as he attempts to run over the girl. The second poacher taunts the lawyer, saying that his heroism was in vain. The lawyer chooses at that moment to throw his lighter a second time, igniting the barrels and killing them both. In the last scene, the girl is in a dance studio for elementary aged children, and she is telling the instructor (Tao Hong) about the whole sequence of events and how she has been changed. As children come in and the lesson begins, the instructor decides to grant the girl's request to work as her assistant, in spite of her not being qualified.

Filming for The Bastard Child was supposed to take place in Bengal, but the film was forced to relocate after only 8 days of shooting due to problems with the Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India, as there were issues with the amount of local hands hired to work on the movie. Filming also took place around Delhi and Haryana, and overall filming for The Bastard Child occurred mostly at night. In 2013 Farooq Sheikh was confirmed to be performing in the film, only for rumors to surface that he be replacing Sabyasachi Chakraborty in the movie. Devvrat addressed these rumors in June 2013, stating that Chakraborty was still part of the movie but that his original role had been split into two different characters due to the director wanting to avoid further potential issues with the Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India. The production for The Bastard Child experienced further issues with the film's release, as the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association did not approve of the movie's title, which included the word \\"bastard\\". Devvrat responded to the criticism over the title, stating that he did not intend for the word to be seen as offensive. Of her role in the film, Raima Sen felt that it was \\"one of the toughest roles she has portrayed on screen in the recent past.\\" Reception & awards Critical reception so far has been positive.

It is the sequel to 2012's The Four. Plot Cold Blood chances upon the scent of blood while Department Six and the Divine Constabulary are setting up camp in a foggy forest. Running ahead of the others, Cold Blood, Life Snatcher, Iron Hands and Ji Yaohua arrive in front of a locked and seemingly abandoned house. In attempt to break the lock, Cold Blood is attacked by a cannon and barely escapes. He notices the person behind the cannon - Zhuge Zhengwo. Keeping the information to himself, the rest of Department Six and the Divine Constabulary rush into the house to discover the bloodshed of many and there is only one survivor, a man Zhuge Zhengwo identifies as Ouyang Da, someone whose face had disappeared off the pugilist world twelve years ago. Every one else have died of similar wounds, all caused by the same weapon that Cold Blood was attacked with. Zhuge Zhengwo shows keen interest in the incident and promptly asks Sheriff King to turn over the case to the Divine Constabulary. Sheriff King agrees, and Ji Yaohua along with the others in Department Six protest; there have been similar cases of massacres that they have been investigating, each with a death of a man that was supposed to have died twelve years ago. The deaths are all tied to Zhuge Zhengwo, as these men were part of the Gang of Twelve supposedly executed by him when they massacred Sheng Yayu's, now Emotionless, family. Department Six strongly believe it is likely that Zhuge Zhengwo had lied about executing the Gang of Twelve and rose to fame, only to silence those that were supposed to have been dead for twelve years now so that his secret would not be found out. Sheriff King believes in his friend but instructs Department Six to continue investigate quietly. Meanwhile, An Shigeng has not died from causing himself explode into flames. His father, Lord An, has him being restored to life with the use of a certain tree-like organism and is planning to usurp the throne at all costs. An Shigeng questions his father's actions and Lord An only replies that everything he does is for the good of his son. Ji Yaohua has nightmares about being attacked in her sleep. Restless and convinced someone is out to get her, she is finally kidnapped by Lady Fog, her senior who is working for Lord An, one night. Lady Fog brings her to An Shigeng and Ji Yaohua is shocked to find him alive. However, she begins to work for Lord An after she's given a poisonous pill. In order for her to remain alive she'll need a monthly antidote that only Lord An possesses. Her loyalties are divided and she asks Cold Blood to meet her at a teahouse. The purpose of the rendezvous is to reveal all of the investigations done by Department Six. Cold Blood has Emotionless accompany him to the meeting. Emotionless is unable to cope with the fact that Zhuge Zhengwo is the prime suspect in the murders. In addition, she intimates that Zhuge Zhengwo may have been lying to her about executing the Gang of Twelve. She hurriedly leaves. Cold Blood quickly follows her. Ji Yaohua is disappointed over the fact that this liaison was not one between herself and Cold Blood. Back at the Divine Constabulary, Cold Blood questions Zhuge Zhengwo and reveals he saw him behind the cannon that day he tried to break the lock of the abandoned house. Zhuge Zhengwo admits that he recognised the weapon used, for it was the very same weapon he was gifted by the Emperor when he served as the chief bodyguard, but he had turned them in to the imperial archives long ago as he did not want to use such weapons of great destruction. He is perplexed by Cold Blood's incessant questions about being the assailant that day at the abandoned house as well as refused answer anything regarding Emotionless's family massacre. He asks Cold Blood to give him two days to solve the mystery and Cold Blood agrees. However, before the two days are up, Sheriff King is found dead and all evidence seemingly point to Zhuge Zhengwo as the murderer. Cold Blood's animalistic side gets the better of him and he attacks Zhuge Zhengwo, blaming his acquiesce to the two- day request as the reason behind the death of the man who brought him up. Meanwhile, another member of the Gang of Twelve claims to be meeting up with Zhuge Zhengwo at the very place Sheriff King was found dead, but before any questions can be asked, Emotionless kills him to exact her revenge. She is furious that she had been deceived for more than a decade but before she can get any answers from Zhuge Zhengwo, they are promptly arrested by Ji Yaohua who has taken over Department Six; one for the murder of Sheriff King and one for the murder of a key witness. With their chief in command and a quarter of their team locked up for murder, Cold Blood, Iron Hands and Life Snatcher are at a loss, leaving the Divine Constabulary hanging by a thin thread.

Biography Annie Dookhan was born Annie Sadiyya Khan into an Indo- Trinidadian family in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago in 1977. She moved to the United States when she was a child and eventually became a citizen. In 2003, she was hired as a chemist at the Hinton State Laboratory Institute in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.Timeline of case from WBUR in Boston She married Surrendranath Dookhan in 2004. Evidence falsification In June 2011, an evidence officer at the lab discovered that Dookhan had tested 95 samples without properly signing them out. Further investigation revealed that she had forged the initials of an evidence officer in her log book, and she was suspended from lab duties. However, she was still allowed to continue testifying in court until February 2012, when district attorneys throughout the Boston area were notified of the breach in protocol and Dookhan was placed on administrative leave. She resigned in March 2012. During Dookhan's time at the Hinton lab, it had been run by the Massachusetts Department of Health's Office of Human Services. However, in a cost-cutting move, the Massachusetts General Court transferred control of the lab to the Massachusetts State Police forensics unit in 2011. The state police mounted a probe into the Dookhan case. The probe revealed that Dookhan's superiors had ignored red flags surrounding her before 2011. For instance, she reportedly tested over 500 samples per month‚Äîfive times the normal average‚Äîeven though her supervisors and colleagues claimed to have never seen her in front of a microscope, and that she frequently misidentified samples. Additionally, Dookhan's productivity remained steady after the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts that chemists who perform drug tests in criminal cases can be subpoenaed to testify in person. According to an independent data analysis by NPR member WBUR in Boston, Dookhan's turnaround time for tests actually dropped from 2009 to 2011. The problem was severe enough that Governor Deval Patrick ordered the lab shut down. In August, police interviewed Dookhan at her home in Franklin, where she admitted to altering and faking test results in order to cover up her frequent \\"dry labbing\\", or visually identifying samples without actually testing them. She even went as far as to add cocaine to samples in which no cocaine was present. She said she had been dry-labbing for as long as three years. At one point, she broke down, saying, \\"I messed up, I messed up bad. I don't want the lab to get in trouble.\\" Charges On September 28, 2012, Dookhan was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice and falsification of academic records. The latter charge came because she had claimed both on her resume and in sworn testimony to have had a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts Boston. However, school officials revealed that Dookhan had no such degree, and had never taken master's level classes there. On December 17, Dookhan was formally arraigned on 27 charges‚Äî17 counts of obstruction of justice, eight counts of tampering with evidence and one count each of perjury and falsification of records. Prosecutors alleged that whenever a second test failed to confirm the initial results, Dookhan would tamper with the vials to make them consistent with the inaccurate results obtained by her dry labbing. She was also charged with falsely certifying results that she knew to be compromised; these certifications were admitted as evidence in court. Imprisonment On November 22, 2013, Dookhan was sentenced to three to five years' imprisonment and two years' probation by Judge Carol S. Ball in Suffolk Superior Court, after pleading guilty to crimes relating to falsifying drug tests. This was greater than the one-year sentence her defense requested but less than the five to seven-year sentence requested by the prosecution. However, Ball said that upward departure was merited due to the ramifications of Dookhan's misconduct. Ball wrote, \\"Innocent persons were incarcerated, guilty persons have been released to further endanger the public, millions and millions of public dollars are being expended to deal with the chaos Ms. Dookhan created, and the integrity of the criminal justice system has been shaken to the core.\\" Dookhan, Massachusetts Department of Correction inmate F81328, served her sentence at Massachusetts Correctional Institution ‚Äì Framingham. By April 2016, she had been granted parole and was subsequently released from prison.Annie Dookhan, key figure in state lab scandal, released from prison, Boston Globe, April 12, 2016 Impact  In January 2015, Benjamin Keehn, a prominent defense attorney with the Committee for Public Counsel Services, said that as many as 40,000 people could have been falsely convicted as a result of Dookhan's actions.ACLU argues for drug-crime defendants in Annie Dookhan saga, Boston Globe, January 9, 2015 In May 2015, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that defendants whose convictions on drug charges were based on evidence potentially tainted by Dookhan can pursue retrials without having to face more charges or tougher sentences. However they would need a retrial to be released. On April 18, 2017, Massachusetts dropped more than 21,000 low-level drug criminal charges involving Dookhan. Out of the 15,570 cases in which she was involved, only 117 will be pursued, according to Daniel Conley, the district attorney in Suffolk County, which includes Boston. However the state kept people in jail they already had prosecuted with the false evidence and covered it up for years. So most of the people affected served their full sentence.Drug Lab Scandal Results in More Than 20,000 Convictions Dropped, NBC News, April 18, 2017 Dookhan's story was the subject of a Netflix series, \\"How to Fix a Drug Scandal\\" created by Erin Lee Carr that was released April 1, 2020. The 4-part documentary focuses on Dookhan and an independent case of fraud in the drug lab by Sonja Farak. How to Fix a Drug Scandal depicts the role of former Attorney General of Massachusetts Martha Coakley, who was accused of political cover up.

This is also the episode where Ted's future children's names are finally revealed; the daughter's name is Penny and the son is Luke. Plot In 2017, Ted's wife goes into labor during their stay at the Farhampton Inn, where they were enjoying their last weekend away before their new baby comes. Ted tells his wife that he hopes the baby arrives soon due to his mother's rule that \\"Nothing good happens after 2am\\". However, his wife says she does not believe the rule and they prepare to leave for the hospital. Four years earlier at exactly 2:01am, 16 hours before the wedding, the gang has a last round of drinks before heading to bed. Marshall keeps ordering drinks to stall his inevitable confrontation with Lily over his new job and the plan to go to Italy. He also uses the opportunity to irritate Ted with the childhood items he got from Mrs. Mosby (one of which being a stuffed turtle toy with a voice recording), but Lily insists they leave. When Marshall learns Lily wants to have the argument after they have sex, he attempts to prolong their lovemaking as much as possible. Just as Ted, Robin, and Barney are ready to call it a night, Barney reveals embarrassing information about himself. Previously, the gang had thought that Barney maxed out at \\"Jabba drunk\\", where he talked like Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars. However, Ted and Robin realize the drinks have brought Barney into a drunken state where he will truthfully answer any question, giving them the opportunity to ask anything they've always wanted to know about him. As Ted and Robin ask Barney questions, Barney makes a number of admissions such as: kissing Mrs. Mosby (but never got further), spending a \\"crapload\\" each year on suits, and Robin's family is incredibly wealthy, which only angers Ted because he paid for everything during their relationship and she never did, while Robin defends herself by saying it only belongs to her family and not her. Robin tries several times to find out why he keeps saying 'ring bear' instead of 'ring bearer' and if there is actually going to be a bear at the wedding. After a few failed attempts, Barney tells Robin that there will be a ring- bearer, whose name is Trevor Hudson, and Barney worked with his mother. Unknown to Robin, an animal keeper is later seen walking with an unseen Trevor Hudson on a chain, making it unclear whether Trevor is indeed a bear or an aggressive man. Ted has one special question of his own: about Barney's real job, given that he has always scoffed the gang by saying \\"please\\" when asked what he does for a living. When Barney still answers the same, Ted guesses that 'please' could actually be referring to the job and asks for more information. Barney reminds them of how he transformed from a hippie to his present state after a yuppie named Greg took his girlfriend, Shannon, from him back in 1998, and needed help transitioning fully into the corporate world. After tracking down Greg, who failed to recognize him, Barney accepted a lucrative job offer from Greg where he is simply responsible for signing any legally questionable documents put in front of him. The \\"Please\\" remark is explained as \\"Provide Legal Exculpation And Sign Everything.\\" Ted and Robin are horrified, pointing out that Barney could be set up like another employee who was arrested the day he applied. Barney tells them the job was part of his master plan: he is actually working with the Justice Department to take down Greg for his company's crimes (and finally score his revenge for what Greg did to him years ago). Future Ted says that a few months after the wedding, Barney revealed his true identity to Greg as FBI agents arrest him on the spot. Satisfied with the questioning, Robin says goodbye to Barney for the last time before the ceremony. When Ted asks how Barney truly feels about finally getting married, Barney confirms he is nervous, but knows Robin is part of what makes him awesome and reaffirms his love for her. Meanwhile, Lily goes to sleep exhausted from the lovemaking but wakes up after Marshall steps on Ted's turtle toy and unpauses their argument. During their fight, Lily insists her art career was her dream and expresses her resentment at Marshall not even consulting her about taking the judgeship. Marshall downplays her art career as a hobby and states being a judge is a great opportunity. When Lily accuses him of being more selfish to her than she ever was to him, Marshall angrily reminds her of the time she left him months before their first wedding to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco. He asks if he, Marvin, and their future children are just consolation prizes to her. Upset by the suggestion, Lily leaves and calls up an unknown person to pick her up from the inn. In another flash-forward to 2017, the Mosby family is leaving for hospital so the mother can give birth to the second child. Ted tells his wife that he and Penny (their infant daughter) are proud of her, revealing his daughter's name to the audience for the first time. As the Mosbys depart, Future Ted remarks: \\"Two AM. It's a good rule. But every rule has an exception, and for us that exception was you, Luke,\\" referring to his son. Critical reception Bill Kuchman of Popculturology praised the episode for having three strong storylines, saying that \\"'Unpause' may have contained one of the series' most devastating moments,\\" referring to the fight between Marshall and Lily. Kuchman also noted that Penny, the name of Ted's daughter, possibly came from the Season 2 episode Lucky Penny, noting that Ted missed a flight to a job interview thanks to a series of events caused by a penny he found in the street. \\"Had Ted moved away all those years ago, he would have never met The Mother. Thanks to that lucky penny, Ted was in the right place at the right time\\". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B+. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode 8.5/10, saying it brought the goods, including answers to two big mysteries.

Early life  Noda was born in 1892 at the Ewa plantation to Esaki and Suma Noda, immigrants from Kumamoto, Japan. In 1905, six years after Takie Okumura started the first Japanese baseball team in Hawaii in 1899, Noda founded the Asahi Nisei Baseball Team. The team would later grow to become the Americans of Japanese Ancestry (AJA) baseball league. At 13 years old, he was the first baseman, captain, and general manager for the team. He graduated from Mid-Pacific Institute and Hawaii High School (a Japanese language school) in 1911. He married Alice Sae Teshima in 1912. He served in the Hawaii National Guard from 1916 to 1917. Career In 1912 Noda started working for the IRS, making him the first nisei to work in Hawaii's federal government. He later became the first nisei to work in Hawaii's judicial system when he obtained a position as a clerk for the Honolulu District Court in 1916. In 1924 he was licensed as an attorney. During his time as an attorney Noda also worked as a sports promoter for amateur and professional athletes from the mainland United States, Japan, and the Philippines. Noda served as member of Territorial House of Representatives from 1948 to 1958 and was a delegate to the 1950 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention. His time in the House of Representatives ended when he entered the Hawaii State Senate in 1959. During his time in office he focused on helping the working class, and helped to end the 1949 dock strike. Throughout his life Noda did community service for the Boy Scouts and the Honolulu Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and started the Honolulu chapter of the JACL. Noda died on March 19, 1986. Honors In 1967 Noda received the La Croix De Chevalier Avec Ruban from the International Amateur Wrestling Foundation.

This is the only episode of the series in which the episode title was used instead of the usual opening that featured the cast and series's title. The plot is mainly focused on Cristin Milioti's role as the Mother, and how some of her life events coincide with those of Ted's and the rest of the gang. The episode has been very well received by viewers and critics, becoming the highest-rated episode of the series according to the online review aggregator IMDb. Plot At MacLaren's Pub in September 2005, a woman passes by Barney and Ted as they get ready for another round of \\"Have you met Ted?\\" It turns out that the woman, Kelly, went to the wrong MacLaren's Pub and takes a cab to another MacLaren's on the East Side to join the Mother (her roommate) on her 21st birthday. She awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death. After the funeral service, she returns to the apartment to open Max's last gift to her‚Äîa ukulele. At St Patrick's Day three years later, Kelly encourages the Mother to go out and date again, bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating. The two women run into Mitch, her old orchestra instructor who was then a music teacher at a Bronx public school. Inspired by his work, the Mother offers Mitch her cello and they head back to her apartment to get it. However, the Mother prepares the cello only to see Mitch pull off The Naked Man. She is disgusted at his move, but momentarily forgets he is naked while he shares some valuable wisdom with her. \\"What is it you want to do with your life.\\" \\"I want to end poverty,\\" she replies. \\"Then every decision you make from here on out should be in the service of that.\\" He leaves and she remembers her yellow umbrella at the bar and goes out to get it, leaving behind Kelly (who earlier rebuffed Barney at the bar) to have sex with Mitch. She learns that a \\"super inconsiderate person\\" (Ted) took the umbrella. The Mother acts on the wisdom from the naked orchestra teacher revealing her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college. In the fall of 2009, the Mother sits her first session in Econ 305 and meets Cindy, whom she offers to move in with as her roommate. They see Ted enter the room (after which The Mother laughs at his \\"shellfish\\" joke), but the Mother thinks she's in the wrong room when he announces the subject and runs off. She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom. A few months later, she gets her umbrella back. Cindy tells her that she broke up with the \\"architecture professor\\" because the man picked out the Mother's items and saw that they were more compatible; in the ensuing conversation, Cindy spontaneously kisses The Mother, which makes her realise her homosexuality. In turn, The Mother decides to start dating again, having not been kissed in a long time. Some time later, a man named Darren approaches the Mother and is welcomed into her band‚Äîhowever, Darren gradually takes it over and makes the Mother carry band equipment. In April 2012, The Mother meets Louis and he helps her with the equipment, but later at MacLaren's Pub (which Louis thought was named \\"Puzzles\\"), she tells him she's not yet ready to date because of her loss. Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and she leaves just before Ted appears to Lily and Barney in a green dress. They begin dating not long after, but they are not really a perfect match (for example, Louis is not amused when The Mother has her English muffin sing show tunes). The Mother's band is eventually booked for Barney and Robin's wedding; she stays at Louis's summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn. In a flash-forward to the eve of the wedding, the Mother discovers Darren's ad for a replacement bass player and heads down to the Inn to confront him, eventually picking up Marshall and Marvin along the way. After seeing Darren get his comeuppance, she returns to Louis's house, where he proposes to her, but she goes outside to think about it. She begins talking to Max and asks his permission to move on with her life. Interpreting a gust of wind as Max's answer, the Mother bids him one last goodbye and declines Louis's proposal, later checking in at Farhampton Inn. On her room's balcony, she plays the ukulele and sings \\"La Vie en Rose\\". Ted hears her next door (with Future Ted saying that it was the first and most favorite time he heard his future wife sing this song) and gets back inside to tell Barney about it, only to find out he has disappeared. Production In interviews before it aired, Carter Bays stated that the episode is \\"a fun little Disneyland tour through the series from the perspective of someone outside the group\\". He also added that they used some \\"fun trickery\\" to incorporate scenes from the pilot and other past episodes. Unlike the 100th episode, which Bays said was more of a celebration of the cast, he stated that the 200th episode was \\"a different kind of story ... but it felt like the right one to do in terms of the greater story of the show.\\" There were a few mistakes in the episode; for instance, the St. Patrick's Day scene was said to take place in April. Carter Bays stated that these will be fixed for future airings of the episode. Critical reception Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A‚àí, saying it felt like \\"the fastest episode this season\\". Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode 8.5/10, saying the Mother's story was \\"both entertaining and heartwarming\\" and opining that while the episode was \\"jam-packed with amusing callbacks\\", the \\"sheer number of similarities between Ted and the Mother\\" was \\"kind of irritating\\". Alan Sepinwall from HitFix has praised the episode, saying, \\"As an episode, \\"How Your Mother Met Me\\" was pretty terrific. I can quibble with a couple of things here and there‚Äîthey were stuck with Darren, for instance, even though I'd have been fine never seeing him again‚Äîbut overall it did about as good a job as possible as a single episode could at both telling a story of the Mother's last seven years, while weaving her into the larger continuity of the series.\\" Kaitlin Thomas from TV.com has also given the episode a positive review, saying, \\"'How Your Mother Met Me' was a great 200th episode for How I Met Your Mother. It was something different, but it was also a long time coming. It fleshed out a character we've been hearing about for nearly nine years but still didn't really know, and it was one of those patented emotional episodes the series does so well that sometimes I wonder why it even bothers with pure comedy. How I Met Your Mother could easily be a successful 30-minute dramedy if it wanted to be, and I maintain that it's at its best when it's doing these kinds of emotional stories. I didn't expect the Mother to have loved and lost at such a young age, but it worked for the show and for her character, and it added a nice bit of depth to the woman Ted will soon love, and that we already do.\\" Kevin Fitzpatrick from ScreenCrush complimented the writers for producing a Mother-centric plot, saying \\"A 200th installment offers the most visible payout yet of that ninth season gamble, allowing us to get to know the titular lady with an all-too- brief installment that revisits a number of moments from the series past.\\" Jessica Goodman from HuffPost said the episode was \\"pure delight for \\"HIMYM\\" fans with encyclopedic knowledge of the gang's universe\\", complimenting its many Easter eggs. Goodman also described the storyline as \\"heartbreaking\\" and summarised that the episode was \\"one of the strongest, most beautiful episodes ... in years\\". Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly summarised the episode as \\"unraveling a person\\". Gonzalez said it changed her perception of what the Mother was like, replacing a mental image of \\"this Dream Girl put on this Earth solely to be the opposite end of Ted Mosby's two-piece puzzle life\\" with \\"a real woman\\" going through heartbreak.

It is the only species in the genus Hypocephalus. Both the genus and species were first described by Anselme Ga√´tan Desmarest in 1832. It is found in Brazil and is popular in museums and collections for its curiosity value and adaptations to digging in soil that make them appear outwardly similar to the mole crickets. Description 279x279px Hypocephalus armatus can reach a body length of about . This rare species has an evident sexual dimorphism, as the very strong legs of the males are more developed than in females. It is similar in appearance to a mole cricket through convergent evolution. In both sexes the flight wings are absent, the prothorax is ovoid and shiny black, the dark brown elytra are welded together and the hind legs are much heavier than the others and adapted for digging. Adult males can be found from November to March, usually after the rains, when they dig into the soil. The exceptional adaptations and taxonomic features have puzzled taxonomists since its description in 1832. It has been placed in the past in a family of its own, Hypocephalidae, followed by placement within the Cerambycidae. It is now placed within the family Vesperidae although molecular studies have not confirmed its placement. Distribution This species is found in Brazil, in the north of Minas Gerais and southern Bahia. It has a fossorial habit and lives in underground galleries.

Plot In the future, Ted and The Mother are in the back of a limo on their way to a New Year's Eve party. Ted pops open some champagne to toast to a great year with his wife, who has just released a new book. The Mother warns Ted to go easy on the champagne, but he tells her he will be fine as he made a vow in the past. Future Ted then recounts the story behind the vow to his children. At 8 a.m. on Sunday, ten hours before the wedding, Ted and Robin finally find Barney passed out in front of his room and are unable to wake him. With the wedding pictures set to begin in two hours, the gang decides they must do whatever they can to revive him. Marshall, disgusted at Barney's drunkenness, makes a vow to never get that drunk again. Future Ted reveals that he would break that vow when he was running for the New York Supreme Court in 2020 and thought he was about to lose to his old friend Brad (also a judge), only to make a comeback victory. Ted reminds the others of Barney's hangover cure, \\"Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir\\", and they remember that it has cured all of their own worst hangovers. The only problem is that the drink has a secret ingredient that only Barney knows. Ted and Marshall decide to recover all the known ingredients, while Robin and Lily attempt to revive Barney long enough to learn the secret ingredient. Robin and Lily first try to take him outside for fresh air, but this results in accidentally throwing him down the stairs. After several other methods prove unsuccessful, Lily joins in Marshall's vow. Future Ted says that she would also break it on Marvin's first day of college, when she and Marshall drink to celebrate Marvin leaving home, only to see Marvin later walk into the same bar. Marshall and Ted, having gathered most of the ingredients, attempt to gather the last one: grease. The chef at the inn states they have no grease, only for Ted to point out that bacon produces grease. The chef says they throw the grease out and will only make more bacon if it all gets eaten before breakfast is over. Ted tries to get Marshall to eat it all, but Marshall refuses and tells Ted to do it. Ted, having never eaten bacon due to his mother's lie that he's allergic, is reluctant to try. After his first bite, however, he begins to hungrily devour it and even wards off Marshall's attempts to eat any. They get the grease from the next batch, which Ted also attempts to eat. Future Ted states that this was the first and last time he ate bacon. Meanwhile, the girls are still unable to revive Barney and Lily suggests making out with Robin, more out of personal interest than a desire to wake Barney. Robin also joins in Marshall's vow, revealed to be broken a few years later while she and Barney are on vacation in Buenos Aires and they wake up in the wrong hotel room with someone else's baby. Their kiss is successful and Barney awakens long enough to tell the gang that the secret ingredient is actually a lie that he made up to make his friends feel better after the worst episodes of their lives. Barney says that he lied to his friends because he loves them and so the gang, realizing that he made a genuine and heartfelt effort to be there for them during some of their weakest moments, decides to lie to him, telling him that they used his 'Weekend at Barney's' play to get through the wedding pictures and Robin's father was impressed with Barney's quieter side and requested a high-five. In reality, Robin canceled the photos and her father kicked Barney in the crotch. Finally, Ted joins in on the vow and it is revealed that he didn't break it. Instead, on New Year's Day 2022, Ted gives the elixir to The Mother after she got too drunk the night before. She drinks it and greets her children as they run in the room. The episode ends with Robin talking about how she and Lily actually made out and suggesting that they do it again in front of Ted and Marshall, even though it's clear she wants to do it again for her own pleasure. Lily, however, says she felt it was weird and has no desire to do it again. Critical reception Bill Kuchman of Popculturology praised the episode for continuing Barney's evolution, saying, \\"It's amazing how much effort HIMYM has put into that transition over the past few seasons, but they've really succeeded in transforming a one-dimensional (yet very funny) womanizer into a fleshed-out person.\\" Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode 7.5/10, saying it did little to move the story forward, but it did include a few telling flash-forward sequences.

Later that month, he signed a two-year deal with the Perth Wildcats. In his rookie season with the Wildcats, Wagstaff was a serviceable role player as he averaged 9.0 points and 3.6 rebounds in 33 games, backing up Shawn Redhage in what was a championship- winning season for the Wildcats. He was subsequently named the recipient of the 2009‚Äì10 NBL Rookie of the Year Award. Following his first hit out in the NBL, Wagstaff joined the Perth Redbacks for the 2010 SBL season. In 26 games for the Redbacks, he averaged 21.1 points and 9.7 rebounds per game. =2010‚Äì11 season: Injury-riddled season= Wagstaff's second season in the NBL was interrupted by an ankle injury suffered in December 2010. The injury forced him out for seven weeks, as he returned to action on 11 February 2011 and played out the season. The Wildcats failed to defend their title in 2010‚Äì11 as season-ending injuries to Redhage and Matthew Knight caused disruption to the team's chemistry, while the team's injury replacements failed to fill the void left by Redhage and Knight. The Wildcats finished fourth on the ladder and were knocked out in the semi-finals by the New Zealand Breakers. In 22 games on the season, Wagstaff averaged 8.4 points and 4.3 rebounds per game. =2011‚Äì12 season: Best Sixth Man= In May 2011, Wagstaff re-signed with the Wildcats on a three-year deal. The following month, he re-joined the Perth Redbacks for the rest of the 2011 SBL season, going on to average 22.4 points and 10.8 rebounds in eight games. Wagstaff's ability to battle the big men down low, display strong post moves, defend well inside and also have a good game on the perimeter offensively and defensively made him an important asset for the Wildcats in 2011‚Äì12. His 38.7% three-point shooting was key in his career-high 11.4 points per game, a solid bench production that helped lead the Wildcats back to the Grand Final series, where they again met their match with the New Zealand Breakers, losing the series 2‚Äì1. Wagstaff was subsequently named the 2011‚Äì12 Best Sixth Man. =2012‚Äì13 season= Wagstaff continued to be a solid back-up power forward for the Wildcats in 2012‚Äì13, rotating with Shawn Redhage while also playing center on numerous occasions. The Wildcats made it back to the Grand Final in 2013, but were again outclassed by the New Zealand Breakers, losing the series 2‚Äì0. In 31 games on the season, Wagstaff averaged 10.3 points and 3.7 rebounds per game. =2013‚Äì14 season: Second Championship= In 2013‚Äì14, the Wildcats were the team to beat as they dominated the competition with imports Jermaine Beal and James Ennis. They made it back to the Grand Final for a third year in a row, this time defeating the Adelaide 36ers 2‚Äì1 to reclaim the NBL championship, marking a league-best sixth championship, while Wagstaff picked up his second championship with the Wildcats. In 33 games on the season, he averaged 10.5 points and 3.7 rebounds per game, while shooting a career-best 42.7% from three-point range. =2014‚Äì15 season= On 8 May 2014, Wagstaff re-signed with the Wildcats on a two-year deal (with the option of a third). On 24 October 2014, Wagstaff was involved in an ugly on-court incident with Sydney Kings forward Josh Childress. With the Wildcats holding a hefty lead late in the third term of their 84‚Äì63 win, Childress hit the floor after running into an off-ball screen from Wagstaff under the Wildcats basket. After getting to his feet, Childress responded by running into Wagstaff with a raised forearm just as Wagstaff got off a shot. The vision of the incident was seen around the world, as Childress was handed a one-game suspension and a fine for unduly rough play and bringing the game into disrepute. The 2014‚Äì15 season turned out to be a near carbon copy of the 2010‚Äì11 season for the Wildcats as they finished fourth on the ladder and were knocked out in the semi-finals, failing to defend their 2013‚Äì14 title in a season that was plagued with injuries. Wagstaff's points production dropped to a near career- low in 2014‚Äì15 as he averaged just 8.5 per game; he still managed to average a career-high 4.0 rebounds per game. =2015‚Äì16 season: Third Championship= On 13 December 2015, Wagstaff played his 200th game for the Wildcats, becoming just the sixth player to play his first 200 NBL games with the Wildcats. After averaging a serviceable 8.3 points per game off the bench for the Wildcats over the team's first 16 games of the season, Wagstaff caught fire in his 200th game in Sydney against the Kings, hitting all six of his three-pointers in the final quarter to finish with a career-high 26 points and leading the Wildcats to an impressive 87‚Äì69 win. His next best performance came in the third last game of the season on 5 February 2016, also against the Sydney Kings, this time at home. In 27 minutes off the bench, he recorded 23 points, a season-high tying 9 rebounds, and 4 assists in a 95‚Äì81 win, helping the Wildcats book themselves a place in the playoffs for a 30th straight season. The Wildcats finished the regular season in second place with an 18‚Äì10 win/loss record, and played the third-seeded Illawarra Hawks in the semi- finals. Wagstaff was a key figure off the bench during the series, a series the Wildcats won 2‚Äì1, moving them on to the Grand Final where they faced the New Zealand Breakers. With home court advantage in the series, the Wildcats defeated the Breakers 2‚Äì1 to claim their seventh NBL championship. He appeared in all 34 games for the Wildcats in 2015‚Äì16, averaging 9.3 points, 4.0 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game. =2016‚Äì17 season: Fourth Championship= On 19 April 2016, Wagstaff signed a two-year contract extension with the Wildcats, keeping him at the club until at least the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. He started the 2016‚Äì17 season in a career-worst shooting funk, going 2-of-17 from the three-point line over the Wildcats' first two games. He stepped up his play in the third game of the season on 14 October, going 6-of-10 from the field for 16 points in a 75‚Äì73 win over the New Zealand Breakers. Wagstaff continued to struggle with his shot as the season progressed but did manage double-digit scoring efforts in five of the first 11 games. The Wildcats started the season 4‚Äì1, but soon dropped to last place on the ladder with a 7‚Äì9 record‚Äîin five December games leading up to Christmas, the Wildcats collected just one win. In that five-game span, Wagstaff failed to reach double-digits while averaging just 5.6 points per game. On 31 December, in the team's first game since Christmas, Wagstaff led the Wildcats with a season-high 20 points in 21 minutes off the bench in a 95‚Äì87 win over the Illawarra Hawks (who were second on the ladder with a 10‚Äì8 record). He shot 5-of-10 from the field and went 9-of-11 from the free throw line. The Wildcats finished the regular season in third place with a 15‚Äì13 win/loss record, and played the second-seeded Cairns Taipans in the semi-finals. After taking Game 1 in Cairns, Wagstaff came up huge for the Wildcats in Game 2 in Perth with an equal season-high 20 points including 5-of-11 from three-point range. The series sweep advanced the Wildcats into the NBL Grand Final for the sixth time in eight years. He went on to help lead the Wildcats to a 3‚Äì0 grand final series sweep of the Illawarra Hawks, as he claimed his fourth NBL championship. The Wildcats not only collected their eight NBL title but went back-to-back for the first time since 1990/1991. In the 95‚Äì86 title-clinching Game 3 win, Wagstaff came off the bench in his 250th game and scored 10 points. Wagstaff became the eighth Wildcat to play 250 games for the club, and the sixth to play his first 250 games for Perth. In addition, he and long-time teammate Shawn Redhage both played their 17th Grand Final game in Game 3, surpassing Ricky Grace's club record of 16. He appeared in all 33 games for the Wildcats in 2016‚Äì17, averaging 9.0 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game. =2017‚Äì18 season= The Wildcats entered Round 8 of the 2017‚Äì18 season with a 7‚Äì3 record. They faced the ladder-leading New Zealand Breakers in Auckland on 1 December and attempted to win in New Zealand for the first time since 2013, while going for their first win over the Breakers following two defeats against them in November. Wagstaff's exceptional final-term shooting display helped the Wildcats end the hoodoo with an 89‚Äì73 victory. He hit four three-pointers in a purple patch midway through the fourth period to finish with 19 points in 23 minutes off the bench. The Wildcats improved to 10‚Äì3 before dropping to 13‚Äì9 by mid-January. On 2 February, Wagstaff scored an equal game-high 25 points on 9-of-13 shooting and 3-of-6 from 3-point range in a 111‚Äì90 win over the Adelaide 36ers, moving the Wildcats to 15‚Äì9. In the Wildcats' regular-season finale on 18 February, Wagstaff scored 16 points in an 89‚Äì61 win over the Cairns Taipans. The Wildcats finished the regular season in third place with a 16‚Äì12 record before losing in straight sets to the 36ers in the semi-finals. In 29 games, he averaged 9.2 points, 3.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game. =2018‚Äì19 season: Fifth Championship= Wagstaff helped the Wildcats start the season with a 10‚Äì1 record, before losing seven of their next nine games. In January 2019, he played his 300th game for the Wildcats. The Wildcats finished the regular season as minor premiers with an 18‚Äì10 record. In March 2019, he won his fifth NBL championship after the Wildcats defeated Melbourne United 3‚Äì1 in the NBL Grand Final series. In 34 games, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.2 rebounds per game. =2019‚Äì20 season= On 5 April 2019, Wagstaff re-signed with the Wildcats on a two-year deal. In February 2020, he passed Mike Ellis (370) for fourth place on the Wildcats' all-time 3-pointers list.

He was first called up to the national side in June 2010 to replace the injured Aron Baynes for the Boomers' three-game series with Argentina at Challenge Stadium. The following year, he played for the Boomers during the two-match YouYi Games international basketball series against China. In 2013, Wagstaff played for the Boomers during the Sino-Australia Challenge against China.

Plot Future Ted tells a story about how he watched his balloon \\"friend\\" fly away, stating the event caused him to believe that if you let go of the things you love, you will lose them forever. In the present, on Sunday at 5 AM, 13 hours before the wedding, Ted and Robin are walking along the beach, reminiscing about Ted's top five exes: 5. Stella, 4. Zoey, 3. Slutty Pumpkin, 2. Marshall from the time he and Ted pretended to be a couple to try to sell Barney's apartment, 1. Victoria; and his five worst exes: 5. Blah Blah (Carol), 4. \\"Boats, Boats, Boats\\" (Becky), 3. Karen, 2. Zoey (who made both lists), and 1. Jeanette. Meanwhile, a drunk Barney walks out of the hotel to find two men on the street and takes them to a strip club saying he will teach them how to live. The two men are dismissive of Barney's claims that the way they dress will be key to picking up women when Barney takes them to Tim Gunn to be fitted for suits, but change their minds when they go to a party where Barney plays the \\"Have you met-\\" game, setting the boys up with two women. At sunrise, Barney tells the boys what he kept telling Ted earlier in the series, that every moment will be legendary if it's shared with friends. Barney hands the two men a stack of napkins; the top napkin says \\"The Playbook\\". Barney leaves after passing on everything he knew about the bachelor life to them without revealing his name. At the hotel, Marshall imagines a ghost Lily in the hotel room with him. After he brings up San Francisco, the ghost Lily says he should have this argument with 2006 Lily. When he tells the 2006 Lily that her leaving him was the saddest he's ever felt, she reminds him of his father's death, which brings a shade of his father into the room. Marshall argues with his ghosts until the present imaginary Lily tells him that as long as he thinks of their arguments in terms of winning and losing, he is gradually going to lose her. When the real Lily returns, she and Marshall reconcile after she tells him that they should stay in New York. When Robin asks if Ted has kept in touch with his ex- girlfriends, he says that he has not, though Future Ted reveals that he had lied. In truth, Ted had contacted Stella, Victoria, and Jeanette to locate Robin's missing locket. After calling Stella and failing to find the locket in Los Angeles, he learned that Victoria had taken the locket with her to Germany. Victoria agreed to send the locket to Ted, but the package had been intercepted by Jeanette. In the present, Ted confesses to Robin that he and Victoria broke up because he was unwilling to end his friendship with Robin. A stunned Robin tells him that she would have been unhappy, but understanding and that she demands to know why Ted would give up Victoria for their friendship; he admits it is because, for him, there is no top 5 ‚Äì only a top 1, which is Robin. It is revealed that Ted's attempt to recover Robin's locket had concluded when Jeanette dropped the locket into the river after, ironically, pointing out how irrational he is for being unwilling to let go of Robin. Ted and Robin end their evening watching the sunrise together and Ted finally lets go of Robin, who is shown flying away in his mind, but is still disappointed to learn that Robin thought he should have kissed her at the end of their first date. Critical reception Bill Kuchman of Popculturology gave the episode high marks, noting that it didn't just rehash previous episodes focusing on Ted and Robin's relationship. \\"There was never a 'will they or won‚Äôt they?' moment in this episode, a change from past Ted/Robin episodes like in last season's Something Old,\\" Kuchman said. Jessica Goodman from the HuffPost gave a positive review, although she criticized a few scenes from the episode: \\"This week, \\"Sunrise\\" catapulted us back to present day in Season 9, the morning of Robin and Barney's wedding. The shenanigans we've come to expect from the final season were back ‚Äì some in an \\"ugh\\" kind of way (ahem ghosts) ‚Äì but Ted's confession left me in a sweet spot.\\" Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode 7.0/10, saying it was definitely engaging, and sometimes even funny, but it also ended on an irritating note.

This distinguishes them from General Baptists who instead hold to an Arminian theology. History United Kingdom Grace Baptist churches in the UK have mainly derived from the Strict Baptists or Strict and Particular Baptists. The Strict Baptist Assembly, established in 1964, held to beliefs outlined in the Baptist Affirmation of Faith 1966. The Assembly of Baptist Churches was established in 1976 and held to the Calvinistic doctrine of Sovereign Grace. Through discussions between the Strict Baptist Assembly and the Assembly of Baptist Churches came a conviction and desire to establish a single Assembly which in 1980 this gave rise to the joint Grace Baptist Assembly. Alongside the establishment of the Assemblies was the establishment of Associations of Strict Baptist Churches of which there were three. These continue today under the updated titles of Associations of Grace Baptist Churches, listed below.

Brunet was a career officer in Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In 1972 American suspicions had triggered one of Brunet's colleagues, Leslie James Bennett, to lose his security clearance, leading to his dismissal. A year after Brunet's death, a Soviet defector named Vitaly Sergeyevich Yurchenko would clear Bennett, and assert that Brunet was the mole. Brunet was the son of Josaphat Brunet, the first director of the RCMP Security Service. According to The Fifth Estate, Gilles Brunet lived beyond his means, and made frequent trips to Mexico. His father would rise to the rank of Deputy Commissioner. Brunet joined the RCMP Security Service in the early 1960s, and at first, seemed to show promise that would merit holding greater positions of trust. He was offered Russian Language training, and did well. He played a significant role in the conviction of Bower Featherstone, and won a promotion in 1966. But Brunet was drinking too much, and his marriage was in trouble because his wife, correctly, believed he was sexually unfaithful to her. According to Secret Service: Political Policing in Canada -- from the Fenians to Fortress America, Brunet enlisted as a Soviet informant in January 1968. Later in 1968, his wife, looking for traces of his infidelities, found a $2,000 payment from the Soviets in his car. She reported the suspicious funds to the RCMP, and her report was dismissed because Brunet had warned colleagues that his jealous wife would say anything to bring him down. Brunet betrayed Nikolai Artamonov, a Soviet who had found political asylum in the USA. After making his way to the USA, and seeking asylum, Artamonov started working with the Defense Intelligence Agency. Soviet agent Igor Kochnov approached Artamonov, and invited him to return home. While Artamonov pretended to agree, and to meet someone to handle his extraction, in Montreal, he informed his FBI handler. Because the meet was in Canada, the RCMP Security Service became involved, and Brunet told his handlers that Artamonov's negotiations to return home were a trap. No one was captured in Montreal, but the Soviets caught up with Artamonov two years later in Vienna, where he died of a drug overdose when they tried to abduct, drug and repatriate him. Brunet was still receiving glowing performance reviews as late as 1972. In 1973, however, he and colleague Donald McCreery were fired, because it was believed they had ties to organized crime figures in Montreal. After they were fired, Brunet and McCreery founded a private security firm. In 1977 Brunet and McCreery were key witnesses before the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP. According to Crimes by the Capitalist State, the pair testified about \\"barn burning, the theft of documents, and 'participation and assistance to the CIA in offensive activities in Canada.'\\" According to the Historical Dictionary of Air Intelligence, Brunet still had knowledge of the handling of Soviet defectors in 1978. The book asserts Brunet told his handlers that Vladimir Vetrov had not been emphatic in rejecting recruitment efforts by the RCMP, which triggered an investigation into Vetrov's loyalty to the Soviet Union, that, in turn, triggered hard feelings that led him to leak secrets about how the Soviets covertly copied western military and technology projects to French agents. According to Moles, Defectors, and Deceptions: James Angleton and CIA Counterintelligence, Brunet died of a heart attack shortly before the RCMP was going to interview him about whether he was a mole. In Enqu√™tes sur les services secrets, Normand Lester writes that he died on April 9, 1984 while he was manager of the Centennial Memorial Gardens cemetery (now Rideau Memorial Gardens) in Dollars-des-Ormeaux, a Montreal suburb. Nigel West, in a book profiling the directors of Britain's MI6, asserted that the RCMP didn't begin investigating Brunet until their suspicions were confirmed by MI6.

The High Street area constitutes the sixth most important retail centre in London, and is home to many restaurants and major retail names. It is pedestrianised for most of its length, and a conservation area runs down a three hundred yard section. There are three examples of public art in the street, and parks at either end of it. In 2017 the High Street gained Heritage Action Zone status, the first in London to do so. History Painting of The Cock Inn by Thomas Rowlandson in 1789. Milestone on Sutton High Street. This shows that Sutton is 11 miles by road from the administrative quarter of London (Whitehall) and 12 miles from the financial quarter (Royal Exchange) Pearson, the oldest cycle shop in the world The Barclays Bank building The section of road that is now Sutton High Street dates from the Middle Ages, and developed into part of the main road from London to Brighton. By the 18th century Brighton's popularity as a coastal resort was growing, and the route was well used, but not yet regularly maintained. This was put right in 1755 when the enacting of turnpike legislation provided a means for the road's better maintenance. This, combined with its intersection with the east-west Carshalton/Cheam Road, led to the development of a small settlement around the tollhouse in what is now the centre of the town. By the beginning of the 19th century Sutton had become a fully-fledged village, and the road was dotted with a number of houses, pubs and shops from Sutton Green southwards up to the Cock crossroads. The road was used frequently by the Prince Regent to access Sutton Lodge on Brighton Road, and, being the main route to Epsom Downs, it was also heavily used by visitors to The Derby. In 1801 the population of the town stood at 579, at that point lower than the other settlements in the borough. However, by 1861 it had risen enough to make Sutton the largest settlement in the borough.Sutton Council documentSutton Council Local Plan Evidence Base Sutton Town Centre high street crossroads conservation area Their position on the London to Brighton turnpike provided the village's two large coaching inns, the Cock and the Greyhound, with trade serving coaches travelling through the village. The Cock Hotel's sign straddled the Brighton road, and its proprietor was the champion pugilist, \\"Gentleman\\" Jackson. The building was demolished in 1898, shortly after a new Cock Hotel had been constructed on a directly adjacent site to the north. Twenty horse and carts passed up and down this stretch in a day. Regular contact beyond the town brought both expansion and sophistication. Small businesses opened up, at first directly related to travellers on the turnpike ‚Äì bakers and brewers to feed visitors, seamstresses to provide running repairs, leather workers to make or mend harnesses ‚Äì and then to provide trade goods for neighbouring communities. When the railway arrived, Sutton's people had become travellers themselves. The population of Sutton grew and the village turned into a town. The High Street near the top was known as Cock Hill until the 1880s ‚Äì the shops on the east side were built in 1880, ten years later than those on the west side. A notatable building to appear around this time was the grand and decorative 1894 London and Provincial Bank building (now home to Barclays Bank), which stands over the historic crossroads. It is four storeys tall and forms a prominent landmark when arriving in the town centre from a westerly direction. There is a series of arches at ground level, and the main entrance is on the corner where the two roads meet, rounded in shape and surrounded by an ornate architrave and segmental pediment. By 1900 the High Street had become heavily built up. By the late 1930s the shops had altered, but the buildings above remained much the same. One new building at this time was Ernest Shinner's new department store, which replaced a Baptist church that had been built in 1886. This later became Allders. The oldest retail business currently operating in Sutton dates back to the 1860s ‚Äì Pearson Cycles was originally a blacksmith shop, but in the 1890s changed to bicycle making and repair. The Pearsons have run the cycle business from the same High Street location ever since. It has been recognised by Guinness World Records as the oldest bicycle shop in the world.http://www.pearsoncycles.co.uk/about-us/ Conservation Area and Heritage Action Zone Pub sign overlooking Sutton High Street at the historic crossroads The high street includes a conservation area, the Sutton Town Centre High Street Crossroads Conservation Area, which was designated on 9 May 2011, following a review of the town centre, which highlighted the historic importance of the highway network at the crossroads of Cheam Road/Carshalton Road and the High Street, as well as the associated buildings and spaces. The conservation area focuses on the area around the historic crossroads, and stretches from the Station down to Trinity Square. The local authority noted that the buildings, especially their upper storeys, were worthy of preservation and enhancement. Its report concluded that Conservation status was warranted on the basis of the historic importance of the area together with its architectural and aesthetic merit. The designation would enable the provision of guidance to landowners and developers on maintaining and improving the historic aspects of the area.

It was also at the Winning Post that, on 23 January 1963, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman became permanent members of the band. In 2011, the Winning Post was added to a list of buildings and structures of local significance. Booksellers The Sutton armillary There are a number of book retailers in the town centre including Waterstones. Its site once was an independent department store when it was built and opened by Ernest Shinner in 1935, and was taken over by Allders in 1979. Allders moved to the then new St Nicholas Centre in 1992. This branch of Waterstones was the first to have a cafe installed. Public Art The Sutton Heritage Mosaic Sutton town centre features six major examples of public art, three of them in the High Street. The \\"Millennium Dial Armillary\\" was dedicated to the town in the year 2000 by the Rotary Club. The Millennium Dial Armillary is a popular feature of the town and continues to provide an iconic focus for the town centre. It was originally installed in the centre of a small \\"Millennium Garden\\", but was slightly re-positioned in 2011, since when it has stood on the edge of the new central square, directly in front of the Waterstones bookshop. The other examples of public art in the High Street are building- height murals. One consists of a set of seven individual murals on a side wall depicting Sutton's European twin towns. The murals were designed and painted (on to plywood) by professional artists Gary Drostle and Rob Turner and were unveiled in 1993 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Sutton's twinning with Wilmersdorf. There is also the Heritage Mosaic measuring high and wide, and covering the whole of another three storey wall in the town square near the Waterstone's bookshop. Commissioned to celebrate Sutton's heritage, the Drostle and Turner mosaic was made from small tiles made of glass and clay, and put in place in 1994. It was designed by Rob Turner, and shows several aspects of Sutton's heritage and local history. The centre-piece is the depiction of Henry VIII's palace at Nonsuch.

President and founder of Banco Esp√≠rito Santo, he was, until July 2014, the banker active for the longest time in Portugal. Salgado was detained on the 24 July 2014 in an investigation into suspected tax evasion and money laundering. He was later released on bail of ‚Ç¨3m after being questioned by a magistrate at Lisbon's central court of criminal investigation.http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fa67e776-133c-11e4-925a00144feabdc0.html#axzz38UbbaMzU  Education  Ricardo Salgado was born in Cascais. The great-grandson of Jos√© Maria do Esp√≠rito Santo Silva and maternal grandson of Ricardo Esp√≠rito Santo Silva Ribeiro, Salgado spent the first years of his life in Lisbon. He lived in Lapa, where he studied at a public elementary school and later at Liceu Pedro Nunes. He has a degree in Economics from the Higher Institute of Economic and Financial Sciences of the Universidade T√©cnica de Lisboa (1969), and did his Military Service in the Portuguese Navy, on the Officer Training Course of the Naval Reserve.  Career  Horasis Global China Business Meeting 2009 Ricardo Salgado joined the Banco Esp√≠rito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa where, in 1972, he headed up the Economic Studies Bureau and subsequently the Credit Board, where he remained until 1975, when the bank was nationalised. From abroad he participated in reconstructing the Esp√≠rito Santo Group, first from Brazil (1976-1982) and later from Switzerland (1982-1991). In 1991, after the reprivatisation, he became Executive Chairman of the Banco Esp√≠rito Santo (BES) and started on a journey that, among many other aspects, led to an increase in market share from 8% to 20% and to its internationalization (BES is present in 23 countries, on 4 continents). In 2002, he was appointed to the Supervisory Board of the Euronext NV (Amsterdam) and in 2006 he took part in the merger of Euronext with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), as a non-executive member of the Board until 2011. He was non-executive Director of Banco Bradesco (Brazil) from 2003 to 2012. He is currently a Member of the Senior Board of the Esp√≠rito Santo Group, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors and Executive Chairman of the Banco Esp√≠rito Santo, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Esp√≠rito Santo Financial Group, SA ‚Äì Luxembourg, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Banco Esp√≠rito Santo de Investimento, Member of the Board of Directors of Banque Priv√©e Esp√≠rito Santo SA ‚Äì Lausanne and Member of the Board of Directors of Banque Esp√≠rito Santo et de la V√©n√©tie ‚Äì Paris. Ricardo Salgado was the mentor of BES internationalization, focusing on the strategic triangle Africa, Brazil and Spain. Today, BES international area weighs half of the bank's profits. In 2012 the bank led by Ricardo Salgado was the only one of the three largest private Portuguese banks to raise capital using only the shareholders and stock market, without recourse to taxpayers' money. In January 2013 BES was the only Portuguese bank to manage the operation that marks the return of Portugal to the markets, since the country has been subject to the European troika's intervention. In May 2014, the Bank of Portugal issued a scathing audit which questioned the financial stability and transparency of BES. In the wake of this report, and subsequent downgrades of the bank's credit, Ricardo Salgado announced his resignation from the post of CEO.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/business/daily-stock-market- activity.html?ref=business Ricardo Salgado was detained on 24 July 2014 in an investigation into suspected tax evasion and money laundering in which Salgado, was later released on bail of ‚Ç¨3m after being questioned by an investigating magistrate at Lisbon's central court of criminal investigation.http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fa67e776-133c-11e4-925a00144feabdc0.html#axzz38UbbaMzU The Prosecutor stated to the media that, ‚Äúafter the court hearing the accused was subject to coercive measures to deposit the amount of ‚Ç¨3 million, is not allowed to leave the national territory and is prohibited from contacting certain people.

He was honored in the category Lifetime achievement in Financial Markets in Investor Relations and Governance Awards in 2012, an initiative of the consultant Deloitte that distinguishes best practices in the business sector. In July 2013, Ricardo Esp√≠rito Santo Silva Salgado was awarded a doctorate honoris causa by the Universidade T√©cnica de Lisboa for his services to the economy, culture, science and to the university.  Money-laundering charges  Financial Times, 25 July 2014:http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2150eb92-13f3-11e4-b46f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz398j9tVDA \\"For the first time in its history, Banco Esp√≠rito Santo, one of Portugal‚Äôs largest banks, has been placed under independent management with no connection to the banking dynasty that gives the lender its name. The family business empire is in turmoil after its three main companies filed for court protection from creditors. Salgado, who was detained and questioned on Thursday, has been made a formal suspect in a money-laundering investigation. The epitome of Portuguese banking‚Äôs fondness for sober suits and wood-panelled boardrooms, Salgado has maintained his traditional gravitas through months of intense crisis for the family group. His serious image matches the power and influence that many believe Portugal‚Äôs best-known banker has wielded for 15 years or more. The media has dubbed him ‚ÄúDDT‚Äù, the initials for ‚ÄúDono Disto Tudo‚Äù, or ‚ÄúOwner of All This‚Äù, a nickname said to have originated in the Esp√≠rito Santo family itself. Salgado was born in 1944 into what was already a wealthy banking dynasty, one of a handful of powerful families that Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, the rightwing dictator, allowed to dominate the Portuguese economy. The Esp√≠rito Santos mingled with the Rockefellers and befriended the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. But the family's social origins were more humble, some suggesting that their name ‚Äì which translates as Holy Ghost ‚Äì originates from a surname traditionally given to babies left at churches by destitute mothers. As a 30-year-old junior director, Salgado escaped being imprisoned with several senior family members, who were held for months after the 1974 coup that overthrew the dictatorship. In 1975, the banking sector was nationalised and the Esp√≠rito Santos dispersed abroad, Salgado living in Brazil and Switzerland. By 1991, he had established himself as the head of the family, leading its return to Portugal and the reacquisition of its bank through a reprivatisation programme. Although wealthy, Salgado is not known for an ostentatious lifestyle, telling a Portuguese newspaper in May that ‚Äúmy life begins at 8.30am in the bank and ends at 10pm in the bank‚Äù. He has made a number of high-profile business enemies during his 22 years at the helm of BES, particularly through feuding between the five strands of the Esp√≠rito Santo family over leadership successions. But the financial and legal woes now engulfing the group have generated bitter rifts that continue to surface. Salgado's influence is rapidly waning. According to annual rankings drawn up by the Jornal de Neg√≥cios newspaper, Salgado was the third most powerful person in the Portuguese economy last year; this year he is in 48th position.

The house is located at 22 Parkside, Wimbledon, south-west London, and overlooks Wimbledon Common. Since 22 February 2013, it has been a Grade II* listed building. In 2015 the building was renovated and donated to the Harvard Graduate School of Design, after Richard Rogers failed to sell the building.  Introduction  22 Parkside on the A219 is a single-storey house designed in 1967 for Rogers' parents (Dr. William Nino and Dada Rogers) by Rogers and his then wife, Su. Set in a narrow plot of woodland just opposite Wimbledon Common, the house was built in 1968‚Äì70. It is a notable early example of Rogers' work. The house was adapted and extended by Rogers' son Ab, who moved into the house with his family in 1998. In 2015 Richard Rogers donated the house to the Harvard Graduate School of Design. It was renovated by architect Philip Gumuchdjian, who restored it to its original design. Harvard Graduate School of Design use the building as part of a residency programme that host students.  Design  The single- storey modernist house is made from bright yellow-painted steel ribs with full-height glazing at each end, and is separated into two parts. The first part is a flat and pottery studio for Rogers' mother, with the main house set in trees behind. Day space includes a large open-plan kitchen, living room and dining room. There are a master bedroom, two small bedrooms, a bathroom and utility room. Two opposite sides of the house, north-east and south-west, have ceiling-to-wall glass with views onto the grounds, which consist of a courtyard and landscaped gardens. The roof is flat and covered in felt. Rogers himself believes this to be among the best example of his early work. Rogers said that the approach he used to design this early work, such as the use of prefabricated steel and glass modules, served as an inspiration for much of his future work, which includes the Centre Georges Pompidou, co-designed with Renzo Piano, and the Grade I listed Lloyd's building. In listing it, English Heritage gave four reasons: its architectural and structural interest, historic interest, experimental use of materials and techniques and its intactness. Architecturally, they called it \\"an early, executed example of a High-Tech, steel-framed house in Britain\\" commenting on the significance of \\"prefabricated components\\" and \\"neoprene gaskets\\". Historically, they described it as \\"an important early work by a very significant architectural practice\\", and \\"a highly significant, surviving early British High-Tech building\\". With regard to material and techniques, English Heritage cited the use of \\"factory-finished components and dry construction\\", the \\"lightness and precision of steel\\", allowing \\"clear spans required for open-plan living and flexibility\\". As for intactness, it was noted that \\"the intention, structure and main built-in fittings are clearly legible, alongside later modifications, an endorsement of its versatility.\\" Ownership The house has been owned entirely by the Rogers' family since it was built. Since 1988 the house has been occupied by Rogers' son Ab and his family and the property was extended before being put up for sale in 2013 for ¬£3.2 million. The property was never sold and the house was taken off the market. Rogers' charity, the Richard Rogers Charitable Settlement, donated it to the Harvard Graduate School of Design, providing a resource for students studying architecture. Rogers said \\"The house will be a gift to Harvard for training of doctorates in the field of architecture ‚Äì my charity is giving it to them.\\" Sources Citations References * Grade II* listed buildings in the London Borough of Merton Grade II* listed houses in London High-tech architecture Houses completed in 1970 Houses in the London Borough of Merton Richard Rogers buildings Modernist architecture in London Wimbledon, London ","title":"22 Parkside"},{"id":"41248077","text":"Veronica Chater is an American author who wrote a memoir of her childhood, \\"Waiting for the Apocalypse: A Memoir of Faith and Family\\" (W.W.

It was hosted by Canadian sportscasters Jay Onrait and Dan O'Toole, who had been well-known locally for their late-night editions of TSN's SportsCentre. The program was initially formatted as the channel's sportscast of record, in a similar manner to ESPN's SportsCenter, featuring highlights and analysis of the day's major sporting events and previews of upcoming events, as well as panel discussions, and other, sometimes-comedic segments. In February 2016, after low viewership and realignments to FS1's editorial operations, the program was retooled as Fox Sports Live with Jay and Dan. The show adopted a late-night talk show-styled format, with a larger focus on comedy segments and interviews than straight sports news. Fox Sports Live was cancelled on February 23, 2017, with Jay and Dan subsequently returning to TSN to host a revival of their previous show. Overview and format The first editions of Fox Sports Live aired most evenings starting at either 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. ‚Äì depending on when a scheduled sporting event on FS1 concludes ‚Äì and running until 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time. On some nights, the program would begin at 9:30 p.m. Eastern or earlier (such as on February 14, 2015, the Saturday before the 2015 Daytona 500, when a special daytime edition of FSL titled \\"Drive to the 500\\" aired at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time). From the program's inception until July 2015, Fox Sports 1 aired short 90-second capsules known as the Fox Sports Live Update at various times in-between commercial breaks; these update segments were alternately branded as America's Pregame Update (titled after the sports preview show America's Pregame, which itself was cancelled by the network in September 2015) ‚Äì providing updates of certain stories or reports on headlines that broke since the previous night's initial Fox Sports Live broadcast ‚Äì during updates aired on weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Eastern. Until the end of the first run after Super Bowl 50, the program was primarily anchored by Jay Onrait and Dan O'Toole on Tuesday through Saturday evenings, and by Ryan Field on Sundays and Mondays. The program also featured a panel of rotating talent with Charissa Thompson serving as moderator and segment host, helming a standalone show at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time, Fox Sports Live: Countdown, on nights when FS1 is not airing a major sports event (during the college football season, the Friday edition of Countdown was known as Fox Sports Live: Countdown to Kickoff). The program often leads each broadcast with different, and sometimes more expansive, event coverage than SportsCenter ‚Äì in particular, during the 2014 postseason, the program maintained a larger focus on Major League Baseball coverage, roughly double the amount covered by SportsCenter. Fox Sports executive vice president Scott Ackerson noted that the program bases what it leads each edition with on \\"the biggest, most important story there is\\" on that day, with editions leading out of an event tending to skew coverage toward the sport that was broadcast beforehand. During broadcasts anchored by Onrait and O'Toole, FSL aired short segments under the Fox Sports 1 Sneak Peek title, which feature either behind-the- scenes featurettes or comedic spots such as the \\"FSL Thrill Cam\\" (with the two stating that the pieces were crafted as an homage to the comedy skits featured on Late Night with David Letterman). The channel provided a more detailed news ticker during Fox Sports Live broadcasts, incorporating a panel on the right side of the screen that displayed additional statistics pertaining to the teams discussed in the highlight or topical discussion segment being shown and a sidebar which resembled that seen on SportsCenter (with the cosmetic difference being that FSLs sidebar was placed on the right side of the screen, whereas SportsCenters sidebar is placed at the left). Off-the-collar segments were also featured on nights in which Onrait and O'Toole anchor, such as \\"Are They Related?\\" (comparing the resemblance of an athlete with another celebrity or fictional character) and \\"Check the Tweeter\\" (featuring Twitter posts from sports luminaries). Most of the lighter moments during the program occurred during the segments \\"Get Me that Stat!\\" (featuring player and team statistics) and \\"The 1\\" (which focuses on the top play of the day). History Development On March 5, 2013, as part of Fox Sports Media Group's announcement of Fox Sports 1's launch (replacing the motorsports-focused Speed), the division announced that it would launch Fox Sports Live as a daily sports news and analysis program that would compete directly opposite with ESPN's longer-established sports news program, SportsCenter (which maintains a more straightforward news, analysis and features format). Fox Sports executives later stated that the program would be treated in the form of multiple shows incorporated within a single three-hour block. Initial plans for the program called for Fox Sports Live to expand to include a morning edition (with New York City being considered to serve as the production base for the proposed broadcast) in January 2014, which ultimately did not launch at that time. Fox Sports previously had attempted national sports news programs (which focused more on highlights than analysis) on its Fox Sports Net slate of regional networks, beginning with the 1996 premiere of Fox Sports News, which in 2000, evolved into the National Sports Report; six years after the cancellation of that program, FSN Final Score premiered on the regional networks in 2006, lasting for three years. On May 6, 2013, Fox Sports named Jay Onrait and Dan O'Toole as the program's main anchors; the two came to FS1 from Canada's main English-language specialty sports channel, The Sports Network (TSN), where the pair gained popularity for their irreverent presentation of sports news while serving as anchors of the late-night editions of that network's sports highlight and analysis program SportsCentre. O'Toole stated in an interview with the sports website The Big Lead that the two gave a directive to Fox Sports Lives writing staff to avoid giving away the highlight within the program's headline segments, in order to use game highlight to help expand upon the story, saying \\"It's not just highlights, we want to make it into an actual show and try to develop that 'show within a show world.'\\" In turn, Fox Sports executives gave Onrait and O'Toole free rein to maintain the humorous, lighthearted approach that made them well known in their home country during their SportsCentre tenure. Two weeks later on May 23, former tennis player Andy Roddick was announced to become a contributor for Fox Sports Live, joining host Charissa Thompson (who rejoined Fox Sports, where she previously served as an NFL sideline reporter and co-host of Fox Sports Net's The Best Damn Sports Show Period, after a four-year run as host of ESPN2's SportsNation) as part of a panel feature discussing the day's sports headlines that would also incorporate interview segments. Then on July 25, Fox Sports announced that former NBA player Gary Payton and former NFL players Donovan McNabb and Ephraim Salaam would be added as contributors; Don Bell and Ryan Field were named anchors of the Sunday and Monday editions as well as breaking news anchors for the daytime Fox Sports Live Updates, while Molly McGrath and Julie Stewart-Binks were also named as contributors to the program. Launch The program premiered on August 17, 2013, the date of FS1's launch, following the conclusion of its first UFC Fight Night telecast (featuring a main event card between Maur√≠cio Rua and Chael Sonnen). The extended 67-minute premiere telecast averaged 476,000 viewers and registered an overnight rating of 0.3 (only three-tenths of a point below the 0.6 earned by that night's 11:00 p.m. edition of SportsCenter). Reviews for the program were mixed (many comments of which in print reviews and on social media complimented Onrait and O'Toole's presentation); Awful Announcing's Joe DeLessio and USA Todays Chris Chase noted similarities to SportsCenters format, with DeLessio adding that Fox Sports Live \\"[added] a layer to [the sports news format] by having the same panel on the show every night and throwing to it regularly\\", while Time columnist Sean Gregory stated the production quality had \\"the Fox Sports feel.\\" Others noted issues with the chemistry of the contributors to the \\"Fox Sports Panel\\" segment. Boston Globe columnist Saul Austerlitz stated that although he felt the program was \\"often amusing\\", it felt \\"strained because of its efforts to differentiate itself from [...] SportsCenter\\". Within a few months of its debut, the format of Fox Sports Live shifted more toward a focus on game highlights and less on panel discussions. Since its premiere, viewership for the 11:00 p.m. broadcast has fluctuated wildly on most nights when the program did not have the help of a strong event lead-in. With declines experienced during its first week (including a 0.0 overnight rating it registered for the August 19 edition), the August 20 edition registered the program's lowest audience up to that point with 61,000 viewers (along with an additional 6,000 viewers on average with simulcasts on many of the Fox Sports regional networks factored in); overall during the period from August 19 to 26, Fox Sports Live averaged 61,451 viewers (compared to the 1,002,588 that SportsCenter averaged during that week). The program saw its highest ratings (to date as of January 2014) on November 10, 2013, when the program averaged 161,000 viewers after FS1's telecast of the Camping World Truck Series Lucas Oil 150 race. Its morning rebroadcast also registered the network's highest ratings in the Sunday 10:00 a.m. Eastern timeslot, with 132,000 viewers on average during the fourth quarter of 2013. Fox Sports Lives highest ratings to date occurred in October 2014, on nights when it had college football and National League Championship Series games as lead-ins, with an average of 353,000 viewers. On October 16, the program earned a single-day ratings high of 2.3 million viewers, following Game 5 of the NLCS, beating the previous high of 2.2 million following a February 2014 NASCAR race telecast (the October 20 edition, without a strong lead-in, comparatively was viewed by only 23,000, a 99% decline); overall during that month, Fox Sports Live averaged 1.3 million viewers leading out of postseason baseball coverage, and just 75,000 viewers without any live event lead-ins, with very limited increases on nights when Fox aired coverage of the World Series (despite heavy promotion during the games). In February 2014, Fox Sports started scaling back its rebroadcasts of Fox Sports Live; as a result, the 3:00 to 6:00 a.m. Eastern repeat block of the program was moved to sister network Fox Sports 2, while FSL repeats on Fox Sports 1 from 5:00 to 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. On June 26, 2015, Fox Sports announced that it would eliminate the Fox Sports Live Update segments as part of a cost-cutting effort done to restructure Fox Sports 1's news operations and streamline the division's television and digital operations, resulting in the layoffs of some of FS1's news and production personnel. The segments were replaced by video content from Fox Sports Digital's @The Buzzer website. In addition, Fox Sports 1 would scale back on live reports for events to which the network does not hold broadcast rights to air. 2016 relaunch and rebrand On February 22, 2016, Fox Sports Live was re-launched with a revamped format as Fox Sports Live with Jay and Dan; the new format placed a larger focus on comedy bits, sketches, and interviews, more in line with a late-night talk show rather than serving as a conventional sports news program. The new format opened with a monologue-like segment, \\"Here's What Happened Today\\", which comedically presented the day's headlines in sports, as well as \\"Jay and Dan's Selected Summation of Today's Athletic Achievements in Sports\\" (JADSSOTAIS). Other segments may be included in the opening. On some nights, Jay and Dan present \\"The Producer Tim\\", the worst play of the day. This leads into a guest for the night (The show also shows the main guest plus two guests that never actually appear on the show, but are provided as comedic relief.). The show ends with \\"Video you've Already Seen On Your Phone\\", a series of viral videos, most comedic, before Jay and Dan unveil \\"The Greg\\" (referring to former anchor Greg Wolf), the best play of the day. The one holdover segment that remained was Ya Blew It, during which Jay and Dan correct their mistakes. Cancellation Fox Sports 1 announced the cancellation of Fox Sports Live on February 23, 2017, with the program's final edition airing the previous night. The duo subsequently returned to TSN in September 2017, hosting a new show called SC with Jay and Dan on that network. On-air staff This section lists the program's main hosts and principal panelists (or \\"opinionists\\", as termed by Scott Ackerman, executive vice president of Fox Sports), some of whom also served as substitute presenters. In addition, Fox Sports Live also periodically used reporters and commentators from the various Fox Sports regional networks. ;Anchors * Don Bell ‚Äì Sunday and Monday anchor; also substitute anchor (2013‚Äì2015); left in 2015 to become sports director at KYW- TV * Jay Onrait ‚Äì Anchor (2013‚Äì2017) * Dan O'Toole ‚Äì Anchor (2013‚Äì2017) * Charissa Thompson ‚Äì Monday-Friday host/moderator of Fox Sports Live: Countdown (2013‚Äì2015) * Ryan Field ‚Äì Saturday and Sunday; also substitute anchor (2013‚Äì2016) * Jenny Taft ‚Äì Sunday and Monday segment host/moderator; also substitute anchor (2013‚Äì2016) * Greg Wolf ‚Äì Saturday and Sunday; also substitute anchor (2013‚Äì2016) * Mike Hill ‚Äì Saturday and Sunday; also substitute anchor (2013‚Äì2016) ;Opinionists :All were mainly seen Monday through Fridays during the old run.

It launched in March 2013 and was one of the lesser known sites to gain popularity with the well publicized closure of the Silk Road marketplace later that year. It ceased operation in December 2013, when it announced it was shutting down after a vendor stole $6 million worth of users' bitcoins. Bitcoin theft incident In December 2013 Sheep Marketplace announced that one of the site's vendors exploited a vulnerability to steal 5400 bitcoins, valued at about $6 million at the time. According to Forbes and The Guardian, several users reported the site had started to block withdrawals of bitcoins more than a week prior to the theft. Users furthermore suggested the site's administrators held far more than 5400 bitcoins, pointing to records of a coincidental transfer of almost 40,000.Block chain record As users in the site's forums began to complain and discuss the possibility of connivance, administrators took the forum offline. Victims of the theft have attempted to identify the thief by sending \\"tagged\\" bitcoins to his accounts, using the public nature of bitcoin transactions to follow these moneys through the \\"blockchain\\" record of transfers. Within a couple days of the theft, a large amount of bitcoins were noticed being processed by Bitcoin Fog, a \\"tumbler\\" used to launder bitcoins by shuffling them between many accounts for a small fee. The size of the transaction, 96,000 bitcoins, caused Bitcoin Fog to fail, leaving the money traceable. Not long thereafter, the last known wallet of the user who had been presumed to be the thief was found to be a wallet owned by BTC-e, a large bitcoin currency exchange. This has led to speculation that the thief sent their money to the exchange in the hope of trading the coins for alternate crypto-currencies or moving to new wallets to further obfuscate their path. In March 2015 Czech police arrested a man suspected to be the Sheep Marketplace thief when he paid for an expensive house entirely in bitcoins. A nine-month investigation showed estimated that he had made $800,000 of sudden purchases. In October 2017 Tom√°≈° Ji≈ô√≠kovsk√Ω, the creator of the Sheep Marketplace, was sentenced to serve nine years in prison for stealing bitcoins from the market's users. In May 2016 two men from Florida were arrested after tracing Bitcoin transactions via Coinbase, however the amount withdrawn was small compared to the total Sheep Marketplace theft.

Early life and education Man-kam Lo was born into a prominent Eurasian family in July 1893. His father was Lo Cheung-shiu, a compradore of Jardine, Matheson & Co.. At the age of 13, he left Hong Kong to study law in England in 1906. He graduated with First Class Honours in the Law Society Examinations in London and returned to Hong Kong in 1915. He began practicing law and later became the senior partner of the law firm Lo & Lo. In 1918, he married Victoria Hotung, the eldest daughter of Robert Ho Tung, a prominent Hong Kong businessman and close friend of his father's. Family Man-kam Lo was the eldest child of Lo Cheung-shiu and Shi Sheung Hing. He had three brothers (Man-wai, Man-ho and Man-hin) and five sisters. Man-wai Lo also became a lawyer and partner in Lo and Lo, and served on the Legislative and Executive Councils. Man-kam Lo and Victoria had six children: Gwendolyn, Wilbur, Phoebe, Vera, Rita and Lo Tak-shing. Lo Tak Sing followed in his father's footsteps, becoming a lawyer and member of the Executive and Legislative Councils. He ran as a candidate in the first elections for Chief Executive of Hong Kong following the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China in 1997. Public life When the first large-scale labour strike broke out in Hong Kong in 1920, Man-kam Lo acted as a legal adviser to the strike organiser, the Chinese Mechanics Institute, and negotiated an agreement between the workers and employers. He was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1921. Lo was ambivalent on the mui-tsai system, a form of child slavery then prevalent in colonial Hong Kong. Initially an ardent defender like Sir Robert Hotung, his father-in-law, he later supported its abolition. From 1929 to 1930, he was the chairman of the Tung Wah Hospital and the honorary legal adviser for the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals. In 1931, he served as honorary legal adviser for the Po Leung Kuk society and the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange. He became the vice-chairman of the Rotary Club in 1932 and the chairman the following year. In January 1934, he was named chairman of the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children. In May 1929, he was elected member of the Sanitary Board. He was also a member of the University Council of the University of Hong Kong from 1932 to 1956, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Football Association in 1933 and first President of the Asian Football Confederation in 1954. Man-kam Lo succeeded his mother-in-law Clara Cheung Lin-kok as director of the Tung Lin Kok Yuen in Happy Valley after her death. Po Kok School was founded and expanded by the Tung Lin Kok Yuen under Man-kam Lo. He received the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in 1935 and the King George VI Coronation Medal in 1937. In 1941, he was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Legislative Council Unofficial member In 1935, Lo-man Kam succeeded Robert Kotewall as one of the three Chinese representatives in the Legislative Council. During his tenure, he was an outspoken advocate for the Chinese community. Lo supported the government's policy on hiring more local civil servants after a report on government salaries led to a public uproar. Governor Andrew Caldecott adopted the policy in 1935 to consider local candidates before vacancies were advertised in Britain. Amidst the threat of a Japanese invasion, Lo was appointed to the Taxation Committee in December 1938, which intended to introduce new taxes to raise extra revenue in preparation for war. The Taxation Committee was replaced by the War Revenue Committee in 1940 and Lo was reappointed to the committee. Due to pressure from the business sector, the Committee rejected the government's proposed Income Tax Bill, recommending instead a partial income tax. Man-kam Lo was an outspoken opponent of the colonial government's policy of racial segregation, which remained in place until 1946. Together with Jos√© Pedro Braga, who later became the first Portuguese appointed to the Legislative Council, he founded the League of Fellowship in 1921, aimed at eliminating \\"racial disabilities\\" and \\"promoting good fellowship within the Colony, irrespective of race, class and creed.\\" On 26 July 1946, following a second reading of a bill in the Legislative Council aimed at repealing the Peak District Reservation Ordinance, a controversial law that prohibited Chinese from living in The Peak district, Lo argued that \\"the Chinese had no particular desire to live on the Peak. Their opposition was based solely on grounds of racial discrimination.\\" In 1940, on the eve of the Pacific War, Man-kam Lo and Leo d'Almada e Castro, the Portuguese representative in the Legislative Council, criticized authorities after a government ship evacuating British nationals to Australia, a majority of whom were of pure European descent, forced a number of Eurasians to disembark in Manila, the Philippines, on the grounds that Eurasians would feel more at ease among brown or yellow- skinned people. At a Financial Committee meeting, Lo raised the issue of racial discrimination, stating that \\"the tax-payers of this colony are being made to pay for the evacuation of a very small and selected section of the community and, whenever necessary, for their maintenance and support during an indefinite period, leaving some 99.9 percent of the population uncared for and unprotected when an emergency does come.\\" Japanese occupation During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, many local Chinese leaders including Man-kam Lo were pressured by the Japanese authorities to serve on various representative committees. After the petition of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce on the difficulties of the disruption of public utilities and of supplies, the currency problem, and prostitution, the Japanese authorities formed the Rehabilitation Advisory Committee. Robert Kotewall and Sir Shouson Chow were appointed chairman and vice-chairman respectively and Man-kam Lo was appointed member of the committee. The committee held 59 meetings and was later replaced by the Chinese Representative Council and Chinese Cooperative Council, in which he was a member of the latter. Lo was able to escape the opprobrium of outright collaboration with the occupying troops due to a series of possibly \\"diplomatic\\" illnesses. In contrast to his years on the Legislative Council before the war, Lo generally remained silent on the wartime councils. One of the only times he spoke was when the Japanese authorities asked how they might improve relations between the Chinese and Japanese. He replied that Japanese troops could take the initiative by not urinating in public. After the British returned in 1945, many local leaders who had collaborated with the Japanese were denied appointments to public positions. Robert Kotewall was asked to withdraw from public life and had to resign from the Executive Council. Sir Shouson Chow never completely returned and Li Tse-fong was not reappointed to the Legislative Council. However, Man- kam Lo was able to return to public life because the British believed he had worked with the Japanese only with great reluctance. Post-war career In 1946, Man-kam Lo was appointed to the Executive Council and re-appointed to the Legislative Council, where he played an important role during his tenure. He was subsequently knighted in 1948 for his efforts in helping to rebuild Hong Kong. After the Second World War, the UK's Labour Government decided to give people in the colonies a greater say over their affairs. On his return to Hong Kong in 1946, Governor Sir Mark Young announced a constitutional reform plan of \\"giving to the inhabitants of the Colony a fuller and more responsible share in the management of their own affairs.\\" The Young Plan proposed an increase in the number of seats for unofficial members on the Legislative Council and the creation of a municipal council elected by the people of Hong Kong. It also proposed the imposition of direct taxes to fund more social services, an idea Man-kam Lo supported. Young's successor Sir Alexander Grantham, however, did not share the same view as Young. With the Chinese Communists gaining in power during the civil war, Grantham advised Downing Street against implementing the reforms, believing that it would provide a potential opening for a Communist backlash. At a meeting of the Legislative Council on 22 June 1949, Man-kam Lo suggested that the Young Plan was no longer the best option for giving Hong Kong residents a greater voice in the government. He tabled a revised proposal, supported by all unofficial members, which called for a smaller Legislative Council with an unofficial majority and the scrapping of the municipal council. Fearing a negative reaction from the Communists, the British Cabinet rejected both Young's reforms and Lo's proposals, deciding instead to allow for the creation of two elected seats in the Urban Council. Man-kam Lo was a supporter of educational reform in Hong Kong. He helped Li Luk-wah establish a school for the deaf and supported Bishop Hall in his efforts to organize schools for the children of workers. In 1950, he sought to have children who were unable to attend primary school registered and recommended to the Legislative Council that the government open an inquiry into government spending on education, arguing that the Grant Code that enabled secondary schools to receive grants was overly generous. Subsequently, the government invited N.G. Fisher, the Chief Education Officer of Manchester, to conduct an inquiry; the resulting report became a significant blueprint for education reform in Hong Kong. In 1950, the government appointed Man-kam Lo to the Committee on Chinese Laws and Customs in Hong Kong, whose aim was to recommend changes to local Chinese customs. In the committee's report, Lo recommended that the custom of Chinese men taking concubines be left untouched on the grounds that the old law \\"if it is not so acted upon...will gradually die out.\\" In March 1951, Man-kam Lo received an honorary degree from the University of Hong Kong. Death Late in his life, Lo suffered from heart disease. On 7 March 1959, he died suddenly of a heart attack at 7:45 pm at his Robinson Road residence. He was 67. Lo had been planning to attend a banquet at Government House on the occasion of a visit by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. On the day of his funeral, hundreds of prominent local residents, including Governor Sir Robert Black and Commander of the British Forces Bastyan. paid their respects at Lo's residence and at Wing Pit Ting, the \\"farewell pavilion\\" in Pokfulam, with the Hong Kong Police band leading the cortege. Wreaths were sent from Governor Black, Secretary of State for the Colonies Alan Lennox-Boyd and former Hong Kong governor Sir Alexander Grantham. Lo was highly regarded by Sir Alexander Grantham in his autobiography Via Ports. Grantham said Lo was outstanding as an Executive Council member and had \\"a first class brain, great moral courage and a capacity for digging down into details without becoming lost in them.\\" References 1893 births 1959 deaths Solicitors of Hong Kong Hong Kong collaborators with Imperial Japan Hong Kong politicians Hong Kong philanthropists Members of the Executive Council of Hong Kong Members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong Members of the Sanitary Board of Hong Kong Presidents of the Asian Football Confederation Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Knights Bachelor Ho family ","title":"Lo Man-kam"},{"id":"41248183","title":"D.
