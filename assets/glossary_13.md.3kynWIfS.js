It is progressive in the sense that could be falsified. It is a rationalist system of beliefs laden to empiricism, built, at least in first term, on certainties (reality is the one that once we stop to believe in it, doesn't disappear) not in mere beliefs. Progressive rationalists see corruption and faith as the two barriers to improved conditions. Politically it is opposed not only to right-wing systems of authoritarian or theocratic rule, but also to moral relativism exhibited by the left. It is distinct from both of its two stand-alone constituents by stating that both progressivism and rationalism are indispensable enablers for a flourishing society. Progressive rationalists generally see democratic governance as the best available political system and many additionally subscribe to libertarian paternalism. They are secularist universally as a result of their rationalism. And their preoccupation with global well-being makes most of them advocates of human and civil rights, environmental conservation and therefore animal welfare. These and other values all derive from their foundational humanistic belief in reason-based change to improve well-being. Notable individuals who have inspired progressive rationalism are Sam Harris for advocating reason, Julian Assange for exposing corruption, and George Carlin for his social criticism. The countries in which the ideals of progressive rationalism have been realized to the greatest extent are the Scandinavian states of Norway and Sweden with their high rates of political trust, secularism, and quality of life.

Delete  O(log M) amortized average } In computer science, an x-fast trie is a data structure for storing integers from a bounded domain. It supports exact and predecessor or successor queries in time O(log log M), using O(n log M) space, where n is the number of stored values and M is the maximum value in the domain. The structure was proposed by Dan Willard in 1982, along with the more complicated y-fast trie, as a way to improve the space usage of van Emde Boas trees, while retaining the O(log log M) query time. Structure An x-fast trie containing the integers 1 (0012), 4 (1002) and 5 (1012). Blue edges indicate descendant pointers. An x-fast trie is a bitwise trie: a binary tree where each subtree stores values whose binary representations start with a common prefix. Each internal node is labeled with the common prefix of the values in its subtree and typically, the left child adds a 0 to the end of the prefix, while the right child adds a 1. The binary representation of an integer between 0 and M − 1 uses ⌈log2 M⌉ bits, so the height of the trie is O(log M). All values in the x-fast trie are stored at the leaves. Internal nodes are stored only if they have leaves in their subtree. If an internal node would have no left child, it stores a pointer to the smallest leaf in its right subtree instead, called a descendant pointer. Likewise, if it would have no right child, it stores a pointer to the largest leaf in its left subtree. Each leaf stores a pointer to its predecessor and successor, thereby forming a doubly linked list. Finally, there is a hash table for each level that contains all the nodes on that level. Together, these hash tables form the level-search structure (LSS). To guarantee the worst-case query times, these hash tables should use dynamic perfect hashing or cuckoo hashing. The total space usage is O(n log M), since each element has a root-to-leaf path of length O(log M). Operations Like van Emde Boas trees, x-fast tries support the operations of an ordered associative array. This includes the usual associative array operations, along with two more order operations, Successor and Predecessor: *Find(k): find the value associated with the given key *Successor(k): find the key/value pair with the smallest key larger than or equal to the given key *Predecessor(k): find the key/value pair with the largest key less than or equal to the given key *Insert(k, v): insert the given key/value pair *Delete(k): remove the key/value pair with the given key =Find= Finding the value associated with a key k that is in the data structure can be done in constant time by looking up k in LSS[0], which is a hash table on all the leaves. =Successor and Predecessor= To find the successor or predecessor of a key k, we first find Ak, the lowest ancestor of k. This is the node in the trie that has the longest common prefix with k. To find Ak, we perform a binary search on the levels. We start at level h/2, where h is the height of the trie. On each level, we query the corresponding hash table in the level- search structure with the prefix of k of the right length. If a node with that prefix does not exist, we know that Ak must be at a higher level and we restrict our search to those. If a node with that prefix does exist, Ak can not be at a higher level, so we restrict our search to the current and lower levels. Once we find the lowest ancestor of k, we know that it has leaves in one of its subtrees (otherwise it wouldn't be in the trie) and k should be in the other subtree. Therefore the descendant pointer points to the successor or the predecessor of k. Depending on which one we are looking for, we might have to take one step in the linked list to the next or previous leaf. Since the trie has height O(log M), the binary search for the lowest ancestor takes O(log log M) time. After that, the successor or predecessor can be found in constant time, so the total query time is O(log log M). =Insert= To insert a key-value pair (k, v), we first find the predecessor and successor of k. Then we create a new leaf for k, insert it in the linked list of leaves between the successor and predecessor, and give it a pointer to v. Next, we walk from the root to the new leaf, creating the necessary nodes on the way down, inserting them into the respective hash tables and updating descendant pointers where necessary. Since we have to walk down the entire height of the trie, this process takes O(log M) time. =Delete= To delete a key k, we find its leaf using the hash table on the leaves. We remove it from the linked list, but remember which were the successor and predecessor. Then we walk from the leaf to the root of the trie, removing all nodes whose subtree only contained k and updating the descendant pointers where necessary. Descendant pointers that used to point to k will now point to either the successor or predecessor of k, depending on which subtree is missing. Like insertion, this takes O(log M) time, as we have to walk through every level of the trie. Discussion Willard introduced x-fast tries largely as an introduction to y-fast tries, which provide the same query time, while using only O(n) space and allowing insertions and deletions in O(log log M) time. A compression technique similar to patricia tries can be used to significantly reduce the space usage of x-fast tries in practice. By using an exponential search before the binary search over the levels and by querying not only the current prefix x, but also its successor x + 1, x-fast tries can answer predecessor and successor queries in time O(log log Δ), where Δ is the difference between the query value and its predecessor or successor.

Some opponents of net neutrality believe such internet regulation would inhibit innovation by preventing providers from capitalizing on their broadband investments and reinvesting that money into higher quality services for consumers. Supporters of net neutrality argue that the presence of content restrictions by network providers represents a threat to individual expression and the rights of the First Amendment. Open Internet strikes a balance between these two camps by creating a compromised set of regulations that treats all internet traffic in \\"roughly the same way\\". In Verizon v. FCC, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated portions of the order that the court determined could only be applied to common carriers. Background The United States Federal Communications Commission established four principles of \\"open internet\\" in 2005: * Consumers deserve access to the lawful Internet content of their choice. * Consumers should be allowed to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement. * Consumers should be able to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network. * Consumers deserve to choose their network providers, application and service providers, and content providers of choice. These tenets of open internet essentially encapsulate the ideas of net neutrality. From 2005 until the establishment of Open Internet in December 2010, these standards existed in name only. In 2009, FCC Commissioner Julius Genachowski revamped these principles by adding the idea that internet service providers may not discriminate against content in any way. After an extensive debate about the viability of net neutrality, the FCC approved Open Internet on December 21, 2010. Details The Open Internet Order \\"creates two classes of internet access, one for fixed-line providers and the other for the wireless Net.\\" These regulations adopt an aggressive net neutrality stance towards fixed line broadband providers but a more lenient approach towards wireless providers. They follow three specific rules: * Transparency. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network management practices, performance characteristics, and terms and conditions of their broadband services * No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; mobile broadband providers may not block lawful websites, or block applications that compete with their voice or video telephony services. * No unreasonable discrimination. Fixed broadband providers may not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic. These rules follow the basic principles of open internet established in 2005, but they embody specific language that regulates fixed-line broadband more closely than wireless internet. The reason that “wireless carriers are regulated far more loosely ” is because by the virtue of their service, these carriers are much more constrained than fixed-line connections. FCC officials claim that technical limitations of wireless internet necessitate looser regulations. =Rules= The FCC's net neutrality R&O; put forward the following rules to govern non-discrimination online: ; §8.1 Purpose. : The purpose of this Part is to preserve the Internet as an open platform enabling consumer choice, freedom of expression, end-user control, competition, and the freedom to innovate without permission. ; §8.3 Transparency. : A person engaged in the provision of broadband Internet access service shall publicly disclose accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access services sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding use of such services and for content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings. (Note: The rule does not require public disclosure of competitively sensitive information or information that would compromise network security or undermine the efficacy of subject to reasonable network management practices.) ; §8.5 No Blocking. : A person engaged in the provision of fixed broadband Internet access service, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices, subject to reasonable network management. : A person engaged in the provision of mobile broadband Internet access service, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not block consumers from accessing lawful websites, subject to reasonable network management; nor shall such person block applications that compete with the provider's voice or video telephony services, subject to reasonable network management. ; §8.7 No Unreasonable Discrimination. : A person engaged in the provision of fixed broadband Internet access service, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic over a consumer's broadband Internet access service. Reasonable network management shall not constitute unreasonable discrimination. Controversy The issue at stake regarding Open Internet is whether the government should regulate internet access or whether the internet is best left to flourish unregulated. In April 2010, these arguments were tested in court, pitting Comcast against FCC regulators. A federal appeals court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Comcast in a unanimous 3-0 decision. The decision focused on the narrow principle of whether the FCC had the right to regulate Comcast's network principles. In fact, the opinion was written so narrowly as to prompt the former legal counsel for the FCC, Sam Feder, to classify it as \\"the worst of all worlds for the F.C.C.” In his estimation, the court case made it all but impossible for the FCC to expect an appeal victory, but it also opened up enough alternatives for the FCC to accomplish its same goals that Congress would be unlikely to give the FCC regulatory authority over the internet. Given these concerns, the FCC revised its plan for net neutrality, and the end result of that revision was the release of the current Open Internet rules. This controversy has often split along party lines with Democrats supporting the regulation and Republicans opposing it. Democrats believe that Open Internet is essential to providing fair access to information, but Republicans argue that the best way for the internet to flourish is for the government to stay out of it. However, in a major exception to this rule, President George W. Bush (R) decided to impose net neutrality regulation on Comcast in 2008. The FCC has continued to encounter difficulties in their efforts to establish an open internet policy. A 2014 ruling by a federal appeals court struck down rules implemented by the FCC pertaining to net neutrality. The court's decision emphasized the FCC's distinction between information services (broadband providers) and telecommunications services, which are treated as common carriers. Because the FCC had previously chosen not to classify broadband providers as a telecommunications service, the court ruled them exempt from treatment as common carriers. Support and opposition The current proposal for Open Internet was opposed by the FCC's two Republican officials, Robert McDowell and Meredith Attwell Baker. They believe that the current order will stifle internet innovation. They also believe that the regulation will not hold up to judicial review. McDowell himself believes that the FCC \\"is defying the court and also circumventing the will of Congress.\\" Democrats and left-leaning organizations are disappointed with the rule as well because they claim that it does not go far enough. Prior to the passage of the regulations, The Progressive Change Campaign Committee attacked Democratic FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, saying \\"Internet users across America will have lost a hero if Commissioner Copps caves to pressure from big business and supports FCC Chairman Genachowski's fake Net Neutrality rules — rules written by AT&T;, Comcast, and Verizon, the very companies the public is depending on the FCC to regulate strongly.\\" In his defense, Copps did not fully support the measure; however, he did feel as though it was a step in the right direction towards Net Neutrality. He said that “The item we will vote on tomorrow is not the one I would have crafted, but I believe we have been able to make the current iteration better than what was originally circulated. If vigilantly and vigorously implemented by the Commission — and if upheld by the courts — it could represent an important milestone in the ongoing struggle to safeguard the awesome opportunity-creating power of the open Internet.” FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski also supported the decision, invoking the actions of the past Republican administration. He said that \\"The rules of the road we adopt today are rooted in ideas first articulated by Republican Chairmen Michael Powell and Kevin Martin, and endorsed in a unanimous FCC policy statement in 2005. President Obama voiced his support for the measure as well, \\"calling the FCC's decision a victory for consumers, free speech, and \\"American innovation.\\" President Obama will also be fulfilling a campaign promise to institute some form of Net Neutrality regulation. Litigation On January 14, 2014 in Verizon v. FCC the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the \\"No blocking\\" and \\"No unreasonable discrimination\\" rules of the order. The court upheld the \\"Transparency\\" rule in the same ruling. Post Verizon proceedings In the aftermath of the 2014 Verizon decision, on February 19, 2014 the FCC Chairman announced that the FCC would not appeal the court ruling, that he intended to seek new rules that would be consistent with the D.C. Circuit's opinion, and opened a new proceeding (GN Docket No. 14-28, \\"Preserving the Open Internet\\") asking for general public comment.

History Few details about the town's history or cultural background survive, other than a mention of the Hindu Brahmin population by Shah Cherag. Hence it is necessary to refer to the history of Brahmani Kingdom, the last king being Muhammad Shah II, who ruled Bidar. Sultan Quli, who had come from Persia to India seeking fortune, served under Muhammad Shah II. Sultan Quli was held in high esteem by the king due to his bravery and excellent leadership. At one time he saved the king from being murdered by Deccani-African soldiers. In 1495 AD, in appreciation of his service, the king granted the villages of Telangana and Jahagir to Sultan Quli and appointed him as Subhedar of Telangana. (The post of Subhedar was vacant after the death of Qutubul Mulk Subhedar in 1493 AD.) Sultan Quli was already in possession of Warangal and some nearby villages. Shortly thereafter, he decided to move to Golconda, changing its name to Muhammad Nagar, as a dedication to the king. After Muhammad Shah II's death in 1518 AD, Sultan Quli declared his independence from the Bamani (Brahmani) kingdom and declared himself as Qutub Shah, a name derived from the earlier name of Qutubulmulk. His rule began in 1518 AD, but it is unknown whether or not the Qutub shahi exercised any direct control over Chichlam. If not, the old system of Alute-Balute Dari, was likely followed in Chichlam. The later writings of minister Madanna Peshwa in the Qutubshahi history corroborates this view. In 1499 AD a severe famine occurred in Maharashtra state. This led to the emigration of many Brahmins to the South. Many settled in Chichlam village. An educated class from Iran-Iraq immigrated to Chichlam as well. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah married Bhagamati in 1589, after waiting 11 years. Bhagamati was a resident of Chichlam, logically of Brahmin extraction. Their relationship was unusual because she was allegedly older than him), and led to discontent. She converted to Islam in 1605 AD. Upon her conversion to Islam, she took the name Begum Hyder Mahal and the name of the city changed to Hyderabad after her. After she became Qutubshahi queen in 1589, Mohummad Quli Qutubshah named his new dream city Bhaganagar after the name of his beloved Bhagamati in 1591 AD. The consistent efforts made by Mir Mohummad Momin, the revered Mir Jumla at that time, to convert Bhagamati into the Muslimfold were fruitful only in 1605 AD, when Bhagamati could be converted and it was in 1605 she was given the name, Hydermahal, and thus the earlier name Bhaganagar was changed to be known as Hyderabad since that time.

Bathyotica was named in a 2002 phylogenetic study of Erpetosuchus. The genus was found to be closely related to crocodylomorphs, and Bathyotica was erected to encompass both taxa. Bathyotica has several apomorphies, characteristics that distinguish it from more basal crurotarsans. A prominent feature is the forward sloping of the quadrate and quadratojugal bones at the back of the skull. The sloping bones open up a space called the otic recess, which is positioned behind the lower temporal fossa, a hole on the side of the skull behind the eye sockets. Members of Bathyotica also lack a postfrontal bone. In 2012, the genus Parringtonia was redescribed and found to be closely related to Erpetosuchus. Both were united in the family Erpetosuchidae. However, the phylogenetic analysis in that paper resulted in Erpetosuchidae being part of a polytomy with the two main branches of Archosauria, Pseudosuchia and Avemetatarsalia, a distant position from Crocodylomorpha. However, this placement was uncertain and the exact phylogenetic position of Erpetosuchus remains unclear because it possesses many autapomorphies or unique features that are not seen in other archosaurs. Nevertheless, a sister-taxon relationship between Erpetosuchidae and Crocodylomorpha required 13 extra steps in their analysis, making it very improbable. Even when Erpetosuchus granti was solely used to represent Erpetosuchidae, it was recovered as the sister taxon of aetosaurs + Revueltosaurus, at the base of Suchia.

Touré worked to mobilize women as the Deputy Director for Ouattara's 2010 Ivorian presidential election. In 2016, she was elected as a deputy in the 72nd circonscription which includes the cities of Guépahouo and Oumé. Since at least 2014, she has been the Executive Director of the Petroci Foundation, the caritative organization of the Ivorian oil and gas company. Congress of Republican Women In the Rally of the Republicans RDR, the ruling political party in Côte d'Ivoire, Aya Virginie Touré has been elected President of the Rally of Republican Women. ()(RFR). She spoke out against Gbagbo and his inner circle of people who were allegedly sending taxpayers' money out of the country as their own personal wealth.  Leader of civil war protests  Touré organized numerous peace protests throughout Côte d'Ivoire during the 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis. In an impassioned interview on BBC News, Touré compared the ongoing Second Ivorian Civil War to the 2011 Libyan civil war and asked for support from the international community. She called for military intervention to remove Laurent Gbagbo from power the same way Charles Taylor was removed in the Second Liberian Civil War. = Demonstrations = In December 2010, Touré led hundreds of women in a peaceful protest during the ongoing crisis in Abidjan. They banged pots to warn about the arrival of the militias. On March 3, 2011, Touré led 15,000 women in a peaceful protest in Abidjan. Some were dressed in black, some were wearing leaves, and some were naked, all signs of an African curse directed toward Laurent Gbagbo. In the neighborhood of Abobo, they were met by security forces with tanks that opened fire on the women. Seven women were killed and approximately 100 were wounded. On March 8, International Women's Day, Touré organized 45,000 women in peaceful protests across the country. The women were met with youth armed with machetes and automatic weapons firing into the air at Koumassi. One woman and three men were killed in Abidjan by the army. On March 8, 2011, Leymah Gbowee issued a statement of support for the peaceful protests of the Christian and Muslim women in Côte d'Ivoire and compared them to the women of Liberia. On March 23, at the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Summit in Nigeria, a \\"One Thousand Women March\\" was organized by peace activists in West Africa in support of the women of Côte d'Ivoire. They wore white T-shirts and represented countries across West Africa including Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. They issued a press release and presented a position statement to the ECOWAS Heads of State. On March 23, Goodluck Jonathan, President of Nigeria urged the United Nations to pass a resolution to take decisive action, saying instability posed a threat to security in West Africa. On March 30, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1975 was adopted unanimously, demanding that Laurent Gbagbo step down as President and allow internationally recognised President Alassane Ouattara to take power.

After fourteen years of the Montreat Worship and Music Conference, the Board of Christian Education was unable to continue financial support of the conference. An ad hoc committee was formed to create an association for the musicians. On July 26, 1970 the Presbyterian Association of Musicians was formed to support of the Montreat Worship and Music Conference. Worship and music conferences The week-long Montreat Worship and Music Conference is held at Montreat Conference Center and is repeated the following week. This intergenerational conference offers a wide variety of classes and ensembles that provide musical, liturgical and theological instruction. The Mo- Ranch/Presbyterian Association of Musicians Conference (MoPAM) is the union of two worship and music conferences. The annual week-long Mo Ranch conference merged with the PAM West conference in 2009 to create an annual worship and music conference at Mo Ranch. PAM has held biennial National Gatherings for church professionals since 2005 in partnership with Presbyterian Seminaries.

The act was enacted as a consequence of the judgment of the Constitutional Court in the case of Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie, which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the state to provide the benefits of marriage to opposite-sex couples while denying them to same-sex couples. Legislative history The Constitutional Court's judgment set a deadline of 1 December 2006 for Parliament to rectify the situation. If Parliament missed the deadline, words would be \\"read in\\" to the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriages to take place. On 24 August 2006, the Cabinet approved the Civil Union Bill for submission to Parliament. It was introduced in the National Assembly by the Minister of Home Affairs on 12 September. The original bill only allowed for civil partnerships between same-sex partners, and also included provisions to recognise domestic partnerships between unmarried partners, both same-sex and opposite-sex. The bill was amended by the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs to allow both marriages and civil partnerships, and to open them to opposite-sex as well as same-sex couples. The committee also removed the provisions dealing with unregistered domestic partnerships. The final vote in the National Assembly was held on 14 November. The ruling African National Congress called a three line whip, requiring its MPs to vote for the bill. Most opposition parties voted against it, while the Democratic Alliance allowed its MPs a conscience vote. The bill passed by 229 votes to 41 with two abstentions. The National Council of Provinces passed it on 28 November by 36 votes to 11 with one abstention. It was signed on 29 November by Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka (acting for President Thabo Mbeki) and came into force the following day. Provisions A civil union may be contracted under the act by a same-sex or opposite-sex couple, and they may choose to form it either as a marriage or as a civil partnership. Whichever name is chosen, the legal consequences of a civil union are the same as those of a marriage under the Marriage Act. Any reference to marriage in any law is deemed to include a civil union, and any reference to a husband, wife or spouse is deemed to include a spouse or partner in a civil union. A person may not contract a marriage or civil partnership if he or she is already married (or civilly partnered) under the Civil Union Act, the Marriage Act, or the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act. Both partners must be 18 or older and mentally competent. The same prohibited degrees of consanguinuity and affinity apply as would apply under the Marriage Act. A marriage or civil partnership must be solemnized by a marriage officer in the presence of the partners and two witnesses. The solemnization may occur in a public office, a private house, or in premises used for the purpose by the marriage officer. The marriage officer asks each partner: and when each partner has said \\"yes\\", the marriage officer solemnizes the marriage by saying: Secular marriage officers under the Marriage Actmagistrates and Home Affairs officialsare automatically marriage officers for the purposes of the Civil Union Act. They may apply to the Minister of Home Affairs to be exempted from performing same- sex marriages on the grounds of conscience, religion or belief. Marriage officers who are ministers of religion are not marriage officers for the purposes of the Civil Union Act unless both they and their denomination apply to be designated as such. Unlike the Marriage Act, the Civil Union Act does not place any restriction on the religious denominations of legally designated marriage officers. Marriage officers have the same powers, responsibilities and duties under the Civil Union Act as they do under the Marriage Act.

About 22,000 people, mostly Jews, were killed in the camp between 1942 and 1944.  History  The Koldichevo concentration camp was built early in the summer of 1942, about 18 km from Baranovichi, in the village of Kałdyčeva, on the road to Novogrudok, in German-occupied West Belarus. A prisoner described it as \\"a sad collection of concrete buildings and overworked farmland, with dilapidated barns, animal stalls, and tool sheds [...] partitioned with an endless fence of barbed wire to create a makeshift prison.\\" The camp was used to imprison Soviet prisoners of war, Polish and Belorussian partisans, and Jews from Gorodishche, Dziatłava, Novogrudok, Stoŭbcy, and Baranovichi. Few prisoners survived the harsh conditions of the camp. In March 1944, the surviving population of about 100 Jews, led by Shlomo Kushnir (or Kushner), drilled a hole in the wall of their barracks, cut through the electrical fence surrounding the camp, and escaped into the moonless night. Twenty-four prisoners were recaptured, including Kushnir, who committed suicide. Many of the rest joined up with the Bielski partisans in the Naliboki forest. On June 29, 1944, with Soviet troops approaching as part of Operation Bagration, the Koldichevo camp was liquidated. 2,000 of the remaining prisoners were shot in a pit beneath a mound. Another 300 were evacuated to Germany. Some of the former policemen who served at the camp were arrested after the war and sentenced by military tribunals in Wrocław (1957) and Minsk (1962). In 1992, Sergis Hutyrczyk, a security guard who had immigrated to the United States in 1954, was identified as a guard from the camp at Koldichevo, accused of lying about his wartime activities and stripped of his U.S. citizenship. He died in 1993 while appealing his denaturalization.

Under the sole rule of the emperor Julian from 361 to 363, Paganism saw an attempt at restoration; while from 363 till 375, under the reigns of Jovian, Valens and Valentinian I, it received a relative tolerance.

Julian was Roman co- emperor since 355, and ruled solely for 18 months 361–363. Julian witnessed the assassination of his father, brother and other family members by the guards of the imperial palace; rightly or wrongly, he blamed this brutal act on the Emperor Constantius, who passed himself off as an outstanding Christian. Upon becoming emperor, Julian decided to restore paganism, the ancient Roman religion, while reforming it in the hope of making it the driving force behind the empire.Pope Benedict XVI (2006) Deus Caritas Est (Encyclical) Julian's religious beliefs were syncretic and he was an initiate of at least three mystery religions. But Julian's religious open-mindedness did not extend to Christianity due to its belief that it had an exclusive perspective on religious truth.

Julian organized elaborate rituals and attempted to set forth a clarified philosophy of Neo-Platonism that might unite all Pagans.(Ammianus Res Gestae 22.12) Julian allowed religious freedom and avoided any form of actual compulsion.

Valentinian and Valens granted complete toleration for all cults at the beginning of their reign in 364.Theodosian Code 9.16.9 Valentinian even allowed the performance of nocturnal sacrifices, which had been previously prohibited due to the attempt of some people to practice unlawful divination under the cover of the night, after the proconsul of Greece appealed to him.Zosimus 4.3 Valentinian also confirmed the rights and privileges of the Pagan priests and confirmed the right of Pagans to be the exclusive caretakers of their temples.Theodosian Code 17.1.60, 17.1.75, 16.1.1 Valens, who was ruling in the east, was an Arian and was too engaged with fighting against the Orthodox Christians to bother much with the Pagans. In both the west and east severe laws were once again passed prohibiting private divination.Theodosian Code 9.16.7, 9.16.8, 9.16.10, 9.38.3, 9.38.4 Due to the over zealousness of the populace to stop harmful divination, the haruspices and augurs began to be afraid to show themselves in public.

History  The company was founded by Melrose native John H. Ludwig in 1889 or 1890 (Pierce, Twomey). Production began in earnest around 1895, and by 1901 the factory in the Bronx was producing up to 3,500 pianos per year. The turn of the century saw Ludwig pianos garnering critical attention for the first time. At the Paris Exposition of 1900, the Ludwig Piano received a high award, and took the highest honor at the 1901 Pan- American Exposition in Buffalo. They also placed well at the London Crystal Palace Exposition of 1902 (Blue Book). This was a high point in Ludwig's history, and records of these awards were printed in many promotional materials, and even on large decorative decals inside the lids of pianos from this time. In February 1906, John Ludwig retired from leadership at Ludwig and Company, after not being re-elected to the board of directors (POMIW). In 1911, John Ludwig sued the company over the use of his name in a case that went to the New York Supreme Court in May 1911 (Trade-mark Reporter). In 1933, the brand came under the control of Ricca & Son, and in 1952, the brand was acquired by Louis J. Karzen's Atlas Piano Company of Chicago (Pierce). The Ludwig name was discontinued by Atlas in 1953 (Pierce). Many of the Ludwig and Co. pianos surviving today are the decorative uprights from 1895–1920, when piano manufacture in New York was at its peak. These pianos were known for their decorative casework and veneered, inlaid designs. In addition to the decorative uprights, Ludwig produced grand pianos and player pianos (often under the name Claviola, with a patented Unit Valve Player Action that is also featured in much of their advertising). Although the value of any older instrument depends largely on its upkeep over the years, many Ludwig pianos have been known to hold up well and still take and hold a tune well even over one hundred years later.

The station is the first news and talk FM station in the Philippines owned and operated by the Catholic church and it is similar to the country's first news and talk station on FM band Radyo5 92.3 News FM Manila owned and operated by TV5 which debuted November 2010. History =Overview= DWAL is a station that brings news, information and evangelization. Pioneer personalities of the FM station were Fr. Nonie Dolor, Lita Aguila-Bicol and Renzo Luna (Renz Belda, also a reporter for DZRH). More personalities added up through the years up to the present. DWAL-FM carries the slogan Evangelization Radio that later evolved into News and Evangelization Radio. Father Ildefonso Dimaano served as its pioneer station manager, starting from its launch in 2009. Fr. Nonie Dolor replaced him from 2011 until April 2016. His position was succeeded by Fr. Jayson Alcaraz until July 31, 2017 when Dimaano returned for a second term as station manager. =1969-2001: AM era= DWAL-FM was inaugurated in 1969 as DWAM-AM (1080 kHz), with Calero Road, Batangas City as its first studios. It is one of the frequencies directly owned by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines. However, with the declaration of Martial Law on September 21, 1972 under Ferdinand Marcos, the station was closed under strict censorship imposed under Proclamation No. 1081. After complying with the papers needed for resumption of broadcasts, DWAM-AM returned on air by October that same year. By the middle of the 70s, the station moved successively to Hilltop, Kumintang Ibaba and settled at the now-demolished Basilica Site until it ceased operations. DWAM, through the years, provided listeners with religious broadcasting, news, music and oftentimes, religious drama. Its notable roster of personalities during the 70's included Lita Aguila-Bicol, Bert Cabual, Fr. Nonie Dolor, Oscar Adelfo de Villa, Rene Beraña and Avis Magtaas; Bicol and Dolor would later team up to reestablish the station at 95.9 FM in 2009 while Cabual rejoined in 2011 after years of overseas work in London. It was also in this period that 1080 kHz enjoyed the distinction of being the sole AM station in the market until Batangas Capitol operated Radyo Balisong (now known as DZBR Bible Radio 531, owned by the evangelical group Cathedral of Praise) opened shop in 1981.Co-workers condemn murder of Batangas election officerCommunication & Mass Media In the 90s, influx of population and development of the city started off, but the potent of provincial AM stations started to dwindle as FM stations like GV 99.9 and Bay Radio (now Brigada News FM) started to air in the city in 1996 and 1998, respectively. On May 8, 1999, 99.1 Spirit FM was established to cater the younger generation with music. =2002-2008: Halt of Operations= Due to the antiquity of the facilities of the AM station, DWAM-AM ceased operations in mid-2002. Efforts of establishing another one took years. The first permit of operations expired in 2004 before full supply of materials was commenced. It was in this time also that two choices were decided, whether to revive the station in the same frequency band or to migrate to an FM frequency as an \\"AM on FM format\\", a concept that was eight to ten years ahead of being a prospective national medium. Ultimately, all efforts of reestablishment fell off. =2009-2014: Transfer to FM= In mid-2009, a new station on the frequency of 95.9 MHz started to air, later to be unveiled as ALFM 95.9 Radyo Totoo with its first slogan Makipanalig, Makiugnay at Makidasal. Test broadcasts began as early as February 2009 under the tentative callsign DZAL with its frequency acquired by Radyo Bayanihan System from the distinct Bayanihan Broadcasting Corporation that served as licensees for Catholic Media Network radio stations in Quezon Province and Baler, Aurora. However, the calls were already taken by a now-dormant AM station in Bicol, hence the callsign DWAL was given instead to get the greenlight at launch. Furthermore, on its first months of broadcast, the station was severely handicapped on its northern broadcast fringe by Radyo Natin Calamba that was then broadcasting on the same frequency. The issue was settled later with the Calamba station moving to 106.3 FM in 2010. It was also on that same year that DWAL-FM first revamped its imaging campaign by carrying the Evangelization Radio tagline.Archdiocese of Gets a New FM Station Since 2010, ALFM has been a training ground for students taking up Mass Communication, AB Communication and Journalism in their pursuit for work in the media industry after graduation. These OJTs work as news gatherers and field reporters during their tenure. One of their notable call-ups from the on-the-job intern to the regular reporters pool was Minerva Padua, who worked with the station from 2012-15. =2015-present: Major Changes= On May 21, 2015, ALFM and Spirit FM went off-air to give way to its transfer from the Basilica Site to its new broadcast complex at the Balmes Building at C. Tirona Street. It returned broadcasting four days later. The old studio has since been demolished and converted to a parish mortuary. With the retirements of Fr. Nonie Dolor and Lita Aguila-Bicol in April 2016, the station gradually shifted to a more news-intensive format that was completed on May 2017 with old station plugs voiced by Aguila-Bicol being replaced by new ones recorded by Spirit FM's DJ Joseph, and revising its slogan to cater more news as Ang Inyong News and Evangelization Radio. In January 2018, the Balmes Building was officially renamed the St. Francis de Sales Broadcast Center, culminating a lengthy rehabilitation of both stations' respective studios for improved service to their online and 95.9's cable TV audience. Coinciding with the station's 9th year on air, new imaging bumpers and programming were launched, starting with the retirement of the Evangelization Radio tagline and unveiling of the slogan Katiwala Mo sa Serbisyo at Tunay na Balita (Your Trusted for Service and Truthful News). Its news operation also added Carissa Hornilla (Spirit FM's DJ Dominique) as co-anchor. On October 6, 2018, the station went to its first 24 hour operation during the arrival of the relic of St. Padre Pio to the country. On May 24, 2019 the station kicked-off its year-long celebration of its first decade on air, alongside its sister outlet's 20th anniversary, and Radyo Bayanihan System's 50th year in operation, with the Archdiocesan Youth Commission's July 13 outreach activity held under its conjunction. The station also unveiled its new ID, voiced by Catholic Media Network national office anchor Cecille Roxas. Cable television carriage For the 2016 Philippine local and national elections, the station's online streaming started its simulcast over the Batangas provincial arm of the MyCATV cable system through its Community Channel (via Channel 8) after a lease- access deal was struck by the management with the TV simulcast becoming permanent a month later. On May 2, 2018, MyCATV's analog cable service was discontinued upon completion of the firm's full digitalization, migrating the simulcast and the Community Channel to channel 123. On December 2018, MyCATV rebranded as Asian Vision. Under the deal, the station's morning news-talk programs from 7:00-10:30 am on weekdays and Sundays, and 7:00-11:00 on Saturdays are simulcast as a leased-access TeleRadyo format. News operation Currently, DWAL-FM provides 19 hours per week of news-oriented programming, a cumulative of 17 and a half hours of news blocks on weekdays and their flagship one and a half hour weekly recap Aksyon at Repleksyon on Saturdays. =History= Upon reestablishment of the station in 2009, the news organization consisted solely of three people. It was founded by former DWAM 1080 kHz mainstays Fr. Nonie Dolor and Lita Aguila-Bicol, and DZRH provincial reporter Renz Belda who uses the name Renzo Luna as a compromise of working for two stations. Initially, there were no field reporters until the 2010 presidential elections when they hired their first, and youngest reporter (at age 16), Ethel Robles. The pool of reporters was further established by hiring former comic cartoonist Onofre Tenorio under the radio name Kakang Bising and freelance DJ Samuel Barral in 2011.

Oxidation, veiling, and bleaching effects are visible. Mordançage is an alternative photographic process that alters silver gelatin prints to give them a degraded effect. The mordançage solution works in two ways: it chemically bleaches the print so that it can be redeveloped, and it lifts the black areas of the emulsion away from the paper giving the appearance of veils. Once the emulsion is lifted, it can then be removed or manipulated depending on the desired outcome. Areas where the emulsion was removed appear to be in relief. These prints can become oxidized during their creation, further altering the tonality of the image.  History  Mordançage was created by Jean-Pierre Sudre during the 1960s. While he is credited with the creation of Mordançage, it is based on a late 19th- century process known as etch-bleach. This process has also been referred to as bleach-etch, gelatin relief, or reverse relief. Etch-bleach was first documented in 1897 by Paul LiesegangLiesegang, Paul (1898). Die Collodion Verfahren mit Jod und Bromsalzen. Leipzig. and was originally used as a reversal process for film negatives. Within a year, a man named Andresen suggested using hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid in the process in the place of ammonium persulfate. Later references to the etch-bleach process show a chemical composition that is very close to that of mordançage - the only difference being the use of citric acid in place of glacial acetic acid. Sudre refined this technique and dubbed it \\"mordançage.\\" His process has since been adopted by some of his students, and has spread from there. Sudre's American student, Elizabeth Opalenik, created what is now known as the “draping effect” in the Mordançage process.  Chemistry  The mordançage solution consists of the following materials. * 10 g copper chloride * 50 mL glacial acetic acid * 25 mL 30%-35% hydrogen peroxide * distilled water to make 1 liter  Process  a self-portrait in the style The mordançage process can be used to treat either fiber-based or resin-coated paper. After making a silver gelatin print, the photograph is placed in the mordançage solution, and left in until the image has bleached. The hydrogen peroxide in the solution softens the gelatin in the emulsion. Next, the chemicals are rinsed off of the print. Some people choose to remove the parts of the emulsion that have started to disintegrate while washing; these areas will be the darkest portions of the print. After cleaning, the print is redeveloped. A variety of fresh or exhausted developers can be used at various dilutions, as well as some toners. Different developers and dilutions will result in different tonalities in the paper. Areas where the emulsion has been degraded may redevelop unevenly. Emulsion removal can cause a reversal effect when redeveloped. Once the image has been redeveloped, it is rinsed off again. The print can be fixed in fixer at this point. Neglecting to fix the image can lead to the oxidation of the print, however these color shifts can be a desirable effect. A final washing of the print is performed after fixing. Any veils that have developed are fragile, which makes the print difficult to wash without causing them to pull away from the paper. Because of this difficulty, mordançage prints will often remain imbued with chemicals. The chemical saturation of the paper can lead to these prints contaminating work areas and other photographs. While the process often follows this progression, it can be altered. Development of the print can be halted at any point in the process through the use of stop bath. Alternatively, sometimes prints will be bleached and redeveloped multiple times until the artist is happy with the results.  Preservation  Photographs that have not been properly fixed and washed can shift color over time through oxidation and acid migration. As with any photographic print, mordançage prints are degraded by exposure to light, humidity, and high temperatures. The mordançage solution is acidic, so these prints can contaminate other materials. Photographs can be interleaved with alkaline buffered paper, or sleeved in polyethylene to help prevent acid migration.

Among his titles, Luis de la Cerda was the count of Talmont, count of Clermont and an admiral of France. He was also made the first 'Prince of Fortuna' (sovereign ruler of the Canary Islands) by Pope Clement VI in 1344, although he never actually set foot on the islands.  Biography  Luis de la Cerda was the second son of Alfonso de la Cerda, the disinherited and Matilde of Brienne-Eu (daughter of John II of Brienne).Masnata y de Quesada, David E. (1985). «La Casa Real de la Cerda». Estudios Genealógicos y Heráldicos (Madrid: Asociación Española de Estudios Genealógicos y Heráldicos): pp. 169–229 Alfonso had been chosen to inherit the Kingdom of León from his grandfather King Alfonso X of Castile-León, but was deposed and driven into exile in 1284 by his uncle, Sancho IV. As a result, most of Alfonso's children, including Luis de la Cerda, were born and raised abroad. Luis de la Cerda spent almost all of his life in the Kingdom of France, in the service of the French crown, and fought in the Hundred Years' War on behalf of his adopted country. King Philip VI of France invested Luis de la Cerda as Count of Clermont and the first Count of Talmont in 1338/39. He was appointed Admiral of France in 1340.  Prince of the Fortunate Islands  Although known since classical antiquity, there had been practically no European contact with the Canary islands (known then as the Fortunate Islands) until the early 14th century, when Genoese captain Lanceloto Malocello stumbled on the island of Lanzarote. European interest in the islands accelerated quickly following a 1341 mapping expedition sponsored by Afonso IV of Portugal, which supplied detailed descriptions of the 'Guanches', the primeval aboriginal inhabitants of the islands. The prospect of new and easy slave-raiding grounds whet the appetites of European merchants. Majorcan expeditions, organized by private commercial consortiums, set out immediately for the Canary islands, with the objective of capturing natives to sell them as slaves in European markets. Luis de la Cerda, then serving as a French ambassador to the papal court in Avignon, submitted a proposal to Pope Clement VI that offered the Catholic Church the more palatable vision of conquering the islands and converting the native Guanches to Christianity. On 15 November 1344, Pope Clement VI issued the bull Tuae devotionis sinceritas granting the Canary islands in perpetuity Luis de la Cerda and his heirs, granting him the sovereign title of \\"Prince of Fortuna\\", with attendant rights to mint coinage and other royal privileges.A copy of Pope Clement VI's bull Tuae devotionis sinceritas (15 Nov 1344) granting the Canaries to Luis de la Cerda is found in Monumenta Henricina vol. 1 (p.207). See also Viera y Clavijo, p.268 In return, Cerda promised to convert the natives and render the papacy an annual tribute of 400 gold florins, due yearly on the feast of Saints Peter and Paul (June 29).Jiménez de la Romera, p.22 Eleven islands were cited in the bull by the ancient (and fantastical) names given by Pliny: Canaria, Ningaria, Plumaria, Capraria, Junonia, Embronea, Atlantica, Hesperida, Cernae, Gorgona and Galeta.MH, vol.1 p.208-09 Upon receiving the crown and sceptre from the hands of the pope, a cavalcade was sent around the streets of Avignon, announcing Luis de la Cerda as the newly created king of the islands.Viera y Clavijo, p.271; Jiménez de la Romera, p.22 Luis de la Cerda quickly acquired the popular appellation of Infante de la Fortuna. Pope Clement VI followed this up with another bull, Prouenit ex tue in January 1345, giving the Cerda conquest the character of a crusade, granting indulgences to any who participated.Pope Clement VI's bull Prouenit ex tue of indulgences (Jan 1345) is found MH, v.1, p.228 Papal letters were dispatched to the rulers of Portugal, Castile, Aragon, France, Sicily, Vienne and Genoa, demanding recognition of Cerda's title and urging them to provide material assistance to Cerda's upcoming expedition (projected within three years). The Portuguese king Afonso IV immediately lodged a protest, claiming priority of discovery, but conceded to the authority of the pope.For Alfonso IV's protest (Feb 1345), see MH, v. 1,(p.231) Alfonso XI of Castile also protested, using the ancient Visigothic dioceses and prior reconquista treaties to claim the islands fell within Castilian jurisdiction and 'sphere of conquest', but nonetheless recognized Cerda's title.For the reply of Alfonso XI (Mar 1345) see MH, vol. 1 p.234. See also Meliá (p.45). Despite their formal recognitions, preparations were stalled by the opposition of the Iberian monarchs. With the assistance of the Archbishop of Neopatria, Luis de la Cerda managed to secure a commitment from Peter IV of Aragon to put some galleys at his disposal, but the others were far less forthcoming, if not outright hostile.Viera y Clavijo, p.272; Jiménez de la Romera, p.22 The renewed outbreak of the Hundred Years War in 1346 put the project on hold, as Luis de la Cerda resumed military service for the French crown. As a result, no expedition was mounted before Cerda's untimely death on July 5, 1348. Tradition holds that the Aragonese galleys prepared for Luis de La Cerda, either tired of the delays (or immediately after his death), decided to set out on their own for the Canaries and attempted a landing on La Gomera, but were quickly repulsed by the natives.Jiménez de la Romera, p.36 As there is no documentary evidence for this expedition, some historians have been eager to identify it with a known ill-fated Aragonese expedition of 1360, but it is improbable that Cerda's galleys would have remained available that late.Jiménez de la Romera, p.36 Luis de la Cerda was buried in the Abbey of Saint-Gilles in Languedoc, France. His titles of Talmont and Prince of Fortuna were inherited by his eldest living son Luis de la Cerda y Guzmán. But after the male lines died without issue, the titles passed through Luis de la Cerda's daughter Isabel de la Cerda Pérez de Guzmán into the house of the Counts (and later Dukes) of Medinacelli. Although it is reported that the papal-conferred title of Prince of Fortuna automatically expired after five years with no expedition, the De la Cerda-Medinacelli family continued to press their claim for the lordship of the islands.Viera y Clavijo, p.273n  Descendants  In 1306, Luis de la Cerda married Leonor de Guzmán, daughter of Alonso Pérez de Guzmán and María Alfonso Coronel. Offspring from this marriage: * Alfonso, Maria, Blanca, Fernando and a second Maria de la Cerda, all of which died in childhood. * Luis de la Cerda y Guzmán (c. 1325 - 1383), second titular Prince of Fortuna and second Count of Talmont. * Juan de la Cerda y Guzmán (1327–1357), Lord of Puerto de Santa María and Gibraleón, briefly alguacil mayor of Seville (f. 1355), ancestor of Cristiano Ronaldo. * Isabel de la Cerda y Guzmán (c. 1329 - 1382), Lady of Puerto de Santa María, married 1. Rodrigo Pérez Ponce de León and 2. Bernal de Foix, 1st Count of Medinaceli. After his first wife's death, Luis de la Cerda married Guiote D'Uzès, daughter of Robert I, Viscount of Uzès. There was no issue from this marriage. Outside of marriage, Luis de la Cerda also had a bastard son Juan de España, born in France in 1347, and recognized in his father's will.

It was succeeded in March 2012 by \\"The Path to Prosperity: A Blueprint for American Renewal\\", the Republican budget proposal for 2013. Representative Paul Ryan, Chairman of the House Budget Committee, played a prominent public role in drafting and promoting both The Path to Prosperity proposals, and they are therefore often referred to as the Ryan budget, Ryan plan or Ryan proposal. The plans stand in contrast to the 2012 and 2013 budget proposals, outlined by President Barack Obama and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The 2012 Republican proposal was formalized and passed by the House of Representatives on Friday, April 15, 2011 by a vote of 235 to 193, largely along party lines. No Democrats voted in favor of the bill, and four Republicans--Walter B. Jones Jr., David McKinley, Ron Paul and Denny Rehberg—voted against it. A month later, the Senate voted against the budget by a vote of 57–40. The 2013 proposal would have provided workers under the age of 55 (beginning in 2023) a choice of private plans competing alongside the traditional fee-for-service option on a newly created Medicare Exchange. Medicare would provide a premium payment to either pay for or offset the premium of the plan chosen by the senior. This plan was similar to a plan developed with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, but was different enough so that the Democrat opposed it. To secure Medicaid benefits, The Path to Prosperity would have converted the federal share of Medicaid spending into a block grant indexed for inflation and population growth. The 2013 proposal also would have capped non-defense discretionary federal spending at $1.029 trillion and consolidated the six existing income tax brackets into two. In April 2011, Ryan published three videos on The Path to Prosperity.America's Two Futures, Saving Medicare, Visualized, and Three Steps to Pro Growth Tax Reform In March 2013, Ryan introduced H.Con.Res 25 to the House of Representatives, a new version of this budget updated for Fiscal Year 2014. The House voted 221-207 to pass H.Con.Res 25 on March 21, 2013. By July, the Ryan budget lost support when even House Republicans failed to support the THUD cuts.\\"Wonkbook: This is what it looks like when the Republican budget strategy falls apart.\\"\\"Republican fiscal splits erupt; Rogers rips party leadership on spending cuts.\\" In 2016, Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed a similar tax plan entitled A Better Way. History On May 21, 2008, Ryan originally introduced H.R. 6110, the Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2008.H.R. 6110: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2008. United States Congress. Government Printing Office. This proposed legislation outlined changes to entitlement spending, including a controversial proposal to replace Medicare with a voucher program for seniors. The Roadmap found only eight sponsors and did not move past committee. On January 27, 2010, Ryan released a modified version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010.H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010. United States Congress. Government Printing Office. The modified plan would provide across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminate income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolish the corporate income tax, estate tax, and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would privatize a portion of Social Security, eliminate the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatize Medicare.

Key features U.S. federal deficits, surpluses, and debt under various plans. The Republican 2012 Budget proposal, as specified to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) by Paul Ryan's staff, encompasses changes to Medicare, Medicaid, the major 2010 health care legislation, other government spending (excluding that for Social Security), and tax law. =Medicare and Medicaid changes= *Medicare: Starting in 2022, the proposal would end the current Medicare program for all Americans born after 1957 and replace it with a new program (still called Medicare) which uses a voucher and would increase the age of eligibility for Medicare: Starting in 2022, the age of eligibility for Medicare would increase by two months per year until it reached 67 in 2033.  After 2022, the current Medicare program ends for all people who have not already enrolled. People already enrolled in the current Medicare program prior to 2022 would continue to receive the program. New enrollees after 2022 would be entitled to a voucher to help them purchase private health insurance.  Beneficiaries of the voucher payments would choose among competing private insurance plans operating in a newly established Medicare exchange. Plans would have to insure all eligible people who apply and would have to charge the same premiums for enrollees of the same age. The voucher payments would go directly from the government to the private insurance companies that people selected.  The voucher payments would vary with the health status of the beneficiary. For the average 65-year-old, payment in 2022 is specified to be $8,000, which is approximately the same dollar amount as projected net federal spending per capita for 65-year-olds in traditional Medicare in that year.  Each year, the voucher payments would increase to reflect increases in the consumer price index (average inflation) and the fact that enrollees in Medicare tend to be less healthy and require more costly health care as they age. They would not increase by the higher, healthcare inflation rate.  The voucher payments to enrollees would also vary with the income of the beneficiary. The wealthiest 2% of enrollees would receive 30 percent of the premium support amount described above; the next 6% would receive 50 percent of the amount described above; and people in the remaining 92% the income distribution would receive the full premium support amount described above. Eligibility for the traditional Medicare program would not change for people who are age 55 or older by the end of 2011 or for people who receive Medicare benefits through the Disability Insurance program prior to 2022. People covered under traditional Medicare would, beginning in 2022, have the option of switching to the voucher system. * The proposal would modify Medicaid as follows:  Starting in 2013, the federal share of all Medicaid payments would be converted into block grants to be allocated to the states. The total dollar amount of the block grants would increase annually with population growth and with growth in the consumer price index (average inflation).  Starting in 2022, Medicaid block grant payments would be reduced to exclude projected spending for acute care services for elderly Medicaid beneficiaries.  States would have additional flexibility in designing their programs. =Repeal of 2010 health care legislation= * 2010 Health Care Legislation: The Republican proposal would make several changes to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the health care provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.  In general, key provisions of those laws that deal with insurance coverage would be repealed, including: * Repeal the requirement that most legal U.S. residents obtain health insurance; * Repeal the establishment of health insurance exchanges and subsidies for some individuals and families who purchase coverage through the exchanges; * Repeal the expansion of Medicaid coverage to include most nonelderly income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level; * Repeal penalties on certain employers if any of their workers obtain subsidized coverage through the exchanges; and * Repeal tax credits for small employers that offer health insurance.  The proposal would repeal the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act (CLASS Act) program for long-term care insurance, as well as a number of mandatory grant programs including funds for so-called high-risk pools, reinsurance for early retirees, and prevention and public health activities.  The proposal would repeal the provisions that created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has the explicit task of reducing the rate of growth in Medicare without affecting coverage or quality.  Canceling the expanded subsidies aimed at closing the \\"coverage gap\\" in Medicare Part D, the so-called \\"Medicare doughnut hole.\\" The gap is a range of spending in which many Medicare beneficiaries are financially responsible for the entire cost of prescription drugs until the expense reaches the catastrophic coverage threshold. =Other healthcare reforms= * Tort reform: Several changes would be made to laws governing medical malpractice, including putting in place limits on noneconomic and punitive damages. =Other spending cuts= The Path to Prosperity reduces other mandatory and discretionary spending from 12 percent of GDP in 2010 to about 6 percent in 2021. One example is Ryan recommended that the federal government not fund the Institute of Museum and Library Services and \\"shift the federal agency's responsibilities to the private sector in his 2015 fiscal year budget resolution\\" such as \\"funded at the state and local level and augmented significantly by charitable contributions from the private sector\\". =Revenues and taxation= The instructions given to the CBO to evaluate the proposal specified revenue of 19% GDP, which is above the current level of around 15% GDP and slightly above the 30-year historical average of 18.2% GDP. The Path states separately that income tax rates would be lowered and selected tax expenditures (such as deductions, exemptions, and subsidies) would be eliminated. A Reuters article has also stated that the plan would eliminate taxes on overseas profits for businesses.Reuters; March 19, 2012; David Lawder, Donna Smith, Richard Cowan; \\"U.S. Republican budget plan seeks to play up tax reform\\"; Washington D.C. =Social Security= Social Security receives no changes in the proposal compared to the baseline. The CBO states that \\"spending on that program is projected to be relatively stable as a share of GDP from 2030 forward.\\" Public opinion According to Politico, most polls are unfavorable towards the plan.Paul Ryan plan unpopular, polls show, Politico According to liberal columnist Ezra Klein when CBO estimates of benefit cuts are factored in, 80 percent or more of Americans oppose the plan. In June 2011, a CNN/ORC poll found that 58 percent of Americans opposed the idea while 35 supported. Among seniors, 74 percent opposed the plan.CNN Poll: Majority gives thumbs down to Ryan plan, CNN In the same month a Pew Research poll surveyed support for changing Medicare and found that 41 percent of Americans opposed it while 36 percent supported it. The Pew poll found that the more Democrats and Independents were made aware of the plan were more likely to oppose it; Republicans were more supportive the more they heard about it.Opposition to Ryan Medicare Plan from Older, Attentive Americans, Pew Research Center An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 31 percent of Americans thought it was a bad idea while 22 percent thought it was a good idea. In April 2011, a New York Times/CBS poll found that 61 percent of Americans thought Medicare was \\"worth the cost\\" making it politically risky to implement the plan. The poll also found that 47 percent approved of turning Medicare into a private insurance program while 41 percent disapproved. A Gallup poll in the same month found an even split for deficit reduction plans with 44 percent of Americans supporting the Democratic plan while 43 supported the Ryan plan, although the same poll found that senior citizens preferred the Ryan plan over the Obama plan. As well, in a Washington Post/ABC poll found that 65 percent of Americans opposed the plan while 34 percent supported it. In April 2011, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 50 percent of Americans wanted to keep Medicare the way it is while 46 percent favored turning it into a voucher system per the Ryan plan. Among seniors, 62 percent wanted to maintain Medicare while 30 percent favored turning it into a voucher program. Reactions and debate Paul Ryan pictured in February 2011. The proposal broadly generated negative reactions from Democrats and positive reactions from Republicans. A news analysis piece by Glenn Kessler in the Washington Post stated that the proposal \\"relies on dubious assertions, questionable assumptions and fishy figures\\". He stated that it involved unrealistic assumptions for the status quo (the alternate fiscal scenario) such as the inclusion of all the Bush-era tax cuts being extended forever and the alternative minimum tax being indexed for inflation. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman called it \\"ridiculous and heartless\\" due to a combination of income tax rate reductions (which he argued mainly benefit the wealthy) and large spending cuts that would affect the poor and middle classes. The New York Times editorial board wrote: \\"We are also certain that repealing [Obama's healthcare] reform – the Republicans' No. 1 goal – would do enormous damage to all Americans and make it even harder to wrestle down health care costs, the best way to deal with the country's long-term fiscal crisis.\\"New York Times Editorial-A Real Choice on Medicare-April 2011 The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, felt \\"The Ryan budget features strong, substantive, market-based reforms to the health entitlements and a solid, growth-oriented tax plan. It cuts spending, in the budget year of 2013 and into the future, from both discretionary accounts and entitlements. Ryan has put forth a serious plan worthy of serious consideration. His budget lays out substantive policy choices, cutting spending, reforming entitlements, and avoiding tax hikes. It also outlines a tax reform that would strengthen the economy and by implication further strengthen government finances through organic revenue growth. It represents real progress toward tackling the nation's fiscal and economic challenges.\\" It later published The 10 Myths of Ryan's House Budget Plan Ryan appeared on the April 3 episode of Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace to discuss the proposal. Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, remarked on CNBC's Squawk Box that the House had ignored the recommendations made by the federal deficit commission. Hoyer said, \\"This is exactly the same rhetoric, exactly the same kind of plan that was offered in 2001 and 2003, and it led to the deepest recession this country has seen; extraordinary loss of jobs and a tanking of the stock market. Very frankly, that's not a path we want to go down again.\\" Speaker of the House John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor praised Ryan's proposal. They argued that a national conversation must take place between people of all political stripes about the fiscal future. Boehner remarked, \\"The president is certainly entitled to disagree with our budget... but what exactly is his alternative?\\" Cantor said on the April 10 episode of Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace: On April 5, 2011 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted that \\"The Path to Prosperity\\" was \\"a path to poverty for America's seniors and children.\\" On April 13, 2011, Obama said \\"I don't think there's anything courageous about asking for sacrifice from those who can least afford it.\\" On an April 27, 2011 conference call with reporters Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that passage of the Ryan plan \\"would be one of the worst things to happen to this country.\\" =Changes to Medicare= Michael Hiltzik in the LA Times says there's no reason to believe that Ryan's proposals will do anything to reduce healthcare costs in the U.S., and reason to believe they would do the opposite. Henry Aaron, one of two economists who coined the term \\"premium support\\" in response to criticisms of health care vouchers, states that the Republican plan for Medicare uses vouchers, not \\"premium support\\". The defining attribute of the plans that Aaron christened \\"premium support\\" was that governmental financial support would rise with average health care costs. The Republican plan instead has this support rising with the consumer price index (general inflation). This difference is crucial to understanding the Republican proposal, as the cost of health care is rising much faster than the consumer price index. The vouchers would rise in value with the consumer price index (general inflation), but as medical expenses have been rising much faster than the consumer price index, the value of the government subsidy would erode over time. When the program begins in 2022, the typical 65-year old would be responsible for about 25% of the cost of their healthcare, which is consistent with Medicare as it exists today. However, the share paid out- of-pocket by this typical 65-year-old in 2030 would be 68% under the Republican plan, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office. Ryan claimed that his new Medicare plan was modeled after the health care plans that Congressmen themselves currently receive. Others point out that Members of Congress have what is called a \\"fair-share deal\\" as they do not bear the entire risk of increased costs because of health care inflation. The health care plan that Members of Congress use indexes benefits to health care inflation, not the consumer price index. As health care becomes more expensive due to inflation, the government, not Members of Congress, are responsible for most of the extra costs. Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, told NPR's Morning Edition that the reductions in Medicare spending would be \\"draconian\\". He also faulted the effort for not including cuts to defense spending and tax increases, which Hoyer argued must be part of any serious budgetary reform. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich called the plan \\"right wing social engineering,\\" \\"radical change,\\" and \\"too big of a jump.\\" Several presumptive Republican Presidential candidates made statements in support of the proposal. Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney applauded the effort for \\"offering real leadership\\" and \\"setting the right tone\\". The Center for Economic and Policy Research has released a study, based largely on CBO calculations, suggesting that the Ryan Plan will add trillions of dollars to the cost of Medicare because of the lower efficiency of private insurance as compared to the current government program. Chief actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's \\"Roadmap\\" with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had \\"some potential\\" to make healthcare prices \\"more sustainable\\", he was more \\"confident\\" in Ryan's plan. =Changes to tax law= James Fallows, a Democrat, former speechwriter for Jimmy Carter, and national correspondent for The Atlantic, panned the proposal. He wrote: Additionally, Erik Wasson wrote: =CBO review= CBO – Federal Spending as %GDP Under Alternative Scenarios and Ryan's Path The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) did an analysis of the resolution (a less rigorous evaluation than full scoring of legislation), estimating that the Path would balance the budget by 2030 and reduce the level of debt held by the public to 10% GDP by 2050, vs. 62% in 2010. The Path assumes revenue collection of 19% GDP after 2022, up from the current 15% GDP and closer to the historical average of 18.3% GDP. A grouping of spending categories called \\"Other Mandatory and Defense and Non-Defense Discretionary spending\\" would be reduced from 12% GDP in 2010 to 3.5% by 2050. The CBO also analyzed the Medicare aspects of the resolution, reporting that: \\"Under the proposal, most beneficiaries who receive premium support payments would pay more for their healthcare than if they participated in traditional Medicare under either of CBO's long-term scenarios. CBO estimated that, in 2030, a typical 65-year old would pay 68 percent of the benchmark under the proposal, compared with 25 percent under the extended-baseline scenario and 30 percent under the alternative fiscal scenario.\\" The benchmark refers to the estimated cost of a private health insurance plan with a benefit package comparable to Medicare. The additional cost was because both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher under private plans. The additional cost would be partially offset by: a) incremental \\"utilization management\\" or care restrictions exerted by private providers versus Medicare; and b) enrollees facing increased cost-sharing would tend to lower utilization of services. =Effects on States and Localities= On August 8, 2012 the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a non-partisan think tank, released a comprehensive study detailing how Paul Ryan's budget plan would affect state and local government. The study concluded that the plan would force states and localities to cut services drastically, due to the substantial cuts in federal funding they would receive. The largest cut in funding from the federal government would be Medicaid funding. The plan cuts federal funding for the federal-state Medicaid program by 34% by 2022, and by steadily larger amounts in years after that. For services such as education, law enforcement, water treatment, and disaster response, states would lose over $247 billion in federal funding from 2013-2021. The plan also would cut federal funding for state and local transportation and infrastructure projects by $194 billion through 2021. By 2021, the plan would reduce discretionary state and local grants to an estimate 0.6% of GDP, which is less than half the average of the last 35 years. The study also concluded that the plan would hurt economic recovery and job growth by forcing layoffs at the state and local levels of government. The plan may also result in higher taxes at the state and local levels, to help offset the cuts in federal aid. = Projections and Assumptions = The Path has been criticized by some commentators and analysts for its allegedly unrealistic projections and assumptions about future levels of discretionary spending, tax revenue, health care costs, and unemployment. The Path projects to achieve a spending level of 3.5% GDP for all federal government spending aside from health care and social security by 2050. In 2011, this spending level was 12.5% GDP. The Path also projects federal tax revenue to be 19% GDP, up from the 2011 level of 15.5% GDP. This had been called unrealistic because the Path calls for $4.6 trillion in tax cuts with no offsetting tax increases, other than the closing of unspecified tax loopholes. The Path assumes that unemployment will steadily drop to 2.8% by 2021. This would be the lowest annualized unemployment rate since the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), began tracking unemployment in 1948. The Path assumes that the cost of Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) will not exceed inflation. Conservative commentator Louis Woodhill has called Ryan's proposal \\"The Path to Austerity\\" because of its exclusive focus on spending rather than economic growth. The Path to Prosperity: A Blueprint for American Renewal In March 2012, the House Budget Committee introduced a new version of The Path to Prosperity as their proposed budget for the fiscal year 2013. The proposal was authored by Paul Ryan and is intended to contrast with President Obama's stance on taxes and federal spending. The proposal aims to reduce the ten-year federal deficit to $3.13 trillion through measures including a cap on discretionary federal spending at $1.029 trillion and dismantling the Obama administration's 2010 healthcare reform law. Similarly to the 2012 budget plan, it focuses on cuts in federal spending—except on national defense—aiming to reduce spending by $5 trillion and balance the budget by 2040. The proposal was endorsed by presidential candidate Mitt Romney and supported by the Republican party; however, according to Reuters, some Republicans in the House have stated that the proposal does not go far enough with its spending cuts. It was also criticized by House Democrats who claimed that the plan would negatively impact the middle class, seniors and lower-income Americans. The proposal was criticized by President Obama in a speech at an Associated Press luncheon on April 3, 2012, where he claimed the plan amounted to \\"thinly veiled social Darwinism\\". The plan was also criticized by Newt Gingrich who called it \\"right-wing social engineering\\". In response, both Ryan and Romney stated that Obama had distorted the facts of the proposal, in particular its aim to reduce federal debt, and had used his criticism to distract from his own economic performance. The Heritage Foundation praised the budget proposal for its cuts to federal spending and for making defense a priority, although it commented that the plan was not bold or aggressive enough with entitlement reforms and spending reductions. The proposal received criticism from progressive organizations, including the Center for American Progress, which argued that the plan would have a negative impact on all but the top 1% and \\"especially hurts communities of color.\\" See also * A Better Way * National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform *U.S. House Fiscal Year 2014 Budget (H.

It was written by Agnes Allen, illustrated by the author and her husband Jack, and published by Faber in 1949. Agnes Allen won the annual Carnegie Medal recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. The Story of Your Home was one of several sequels to The Story of the Village (Faber, 1947), by Agnes Allen alone. . Retrieved 2012-07-23.  Origins  Agnes Allen attributes the inspiration for this book to her young son's curiosity about the old Elizabethan houses in the Oxfordshire village where they lived in the summer of 1943. She realized \\"that thousands of children, like himself, were growing up in brick-built houses in which one turned a tap if one needed water, pressed a switch to flood a room with light, struck a match if one wanted to light a fire.\\" Because of this, she conceived the idea of a children's book that would \\"describe the ordinary homes of ordinary people at different periods, right back to the days when almost everything that made up the home, including the very house itself, was there only as a result of the personal exertions of the men and woman who made up the household.\\" The period in which this book was published has been described as the great age of the non-fictional series. These series, sometimes by a single author, sometimes by multiple authors under a general banner, were produced by publishers with an eye to selling particularly to schools and libraries.Marcus Crouch, Treasure Seekers and Borrowers: Children's books in Britain 1900-1960, Library Association, 1963, p. 109. Accounts of British social history were particularly in tune with the national regeneration of the post-war years. The dust jacket of The Story of Your Home addressed the school market directly, saying: \\"It is especially suitable for the upper forms of a Secondary Modern School, where it could be used as a History or Social Studies reading book, as a model and reference book for project work, and as a general reference or library book.\\"The Story of Your Home, 1949, inner jacket flap.

In an embedded system it is often desirable to communicate with another device wirelessly. This wireless communication may be accomplished through optical communication or through radio-frequency (RF) communication. For many applications, the medium of choice is RF since it does not require line of sight. RF communications incorporate a transmitter and a receiver. They are of various types and ranges. Some can transmit up to 500 feet. RF modules are typically fabricated using RF CMOS technology. RF modules are widely used in electronic design owing to the difficulty of designing radio circuitry. Good electronic radio design is notoriously complex because of the sensitivity of radio circuits and the accuracy of components and layouts required to achieve operation on a specific frequency. In addition, reliable RF communication circuit requires careful monitoring of the manufacturing process to ensure that the RF performance is not adversely affected. Finally, radio circuits are usually subject to limits on radiated emissions, and require Conformance testing and certification by a standardization organization such as ETSI or the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). For these reasons, design engineers will often design a circuit for an application which requires radio communication and then \\"drop in\\" a pre-made radio module rather than attempt a discrete design, saving time and money on development. RF modules are most often used in medium and low volume products for consumer applications such as garage door openers, wireless alarm or monitoring systems, industrial remote controls, smart sensor applications, and wireless home automation systems. They are sometimes used to replace older infrared communication designs as they have the advantage of not requiring line-of-sight operation. Several carrier frequencies are commonly used in commercially available RF modules, including those in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands such as 433.92 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2400 MHz. These frequencies are used because of national and international regulations governing the used of radio for communication. Short Range Devices may also use frequencies available for unlicensed such as 315 MHz and 868 MHz. RF modules may comply with a defined protocol for RF communications such as Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy, or Wi-Fi, or they may implement a proprietary protocol.  Types of RF modules  The term RF module can be applied to many different types, shapes and sizes of small electronic sub assembly circuit board. It can also be applied to modules across a huge variation of functionality and capability. RF modules typically incorporate a printed circuit board, transmit or receive circuit, antenna, and serial interface for communication to the host processor. Most standard, well known types are covered here: * transmitter module * receiver module * transceiver module * system on a chip module. = Transmitter modules = An RF transmitter module is a small PCB sub-assembly capable of transmitting a radio wave and modulating that wave to carry data. Transmitter modules are usually implemented alongside a microcontroller which will provide data to the module which can be transmitted. RF transmitters are usually subject to regulatory requirements which dictate the maximum allowable transmitter power output, harmonics, and band edge requirements. = Receiver modules = An RF receiver module receives the modulated RF signal, and demodulates it. There are two types of RF receiver modules: superheterodyne receivers and superregenerative receivers. Superregenerative modules are usually low cost and low power designs using a series of amplifiers to extract modulated data from a carrier wave. Superregenerative modules are generally imprecise as their frequency of operation varies considerably with temperature and power supply voltage. Superheterodyne receivers have a performance advantage over superregenerative; they offer increased accuracy and stability over a large voltage and temperature range. This stability comes from a fixed crystal design which in the past tended to mean a comparatively more expensive product. However, advances in receiver chip design now mean that currently there is little price difference between superheterodyne and superregenerative receiver modules. = Transceiver modules = An RF transceiver module incorporates both a transmitter and receiver. The circuit is typically designed for half-duplex operation, although full-duplex modules are available, typically at a higher cost due to the added complexity. = System on a chip (SoC) module = An SoC module is the same as a transceiver module, but it is often made with an onboard microcontroller. The microcontroller is typically used to handle radio data packetisation or managing a protocol such as an IEEE 802.15.4 compliant module. This type of module is typically used for designs that require additional processing for compliance with a protocol when the designer does not wish to incorporate this processing into the host microcontroller.  Host microcontroller interface  RF modules typically communicate with an embedded system, such as a microcontroller or a microprocessor. The communication protocols include UART, used in Digi International's X-Bee modules, Serial Peripheral Interface Bus used in Anaren's AIR modules and Universal Serial Bus used in Roving Networks' modules. Although the module may use a standardized protocol for wireless communication, the commands sent over the microcontroller interface are typically not standardized as each vendor has its own proprietary communications format. The speed of the microcontroller interface depends on the speed of the underlying RF protocol used: higher speed RF protocols such as Wi-Fi require a high-speed serial interface such as USB whereas protocols with a slower data rate such as Bluetooth Low Energy may use a UART interface.  RF signal modulation  There are several types of digital signal modulation methods commonly used in RF transmitter and receiver modules: * ASK * OOK * FSK * direct-sequence spread spectrum * frequency-hopping spread spectrum. The detailed description, advantages and disadvantages are listed in the linked articles above.  Main factors affecting RF module performance  As with any other RF device, the performance of an RF module will depend on a number of factors. For example, by increasing the transmitter power, a larger communication distance will be achieved. However, this will also result in a higher electrical power drain on the transmitter device, which will cause shorter operating life for battery powered devices. Also, using a higher transmit power will make the system more prone to interference with other RF devices, and may in fact possibly cause the device to become illegal depending on the jurisdiction. Correspondingly, increasing the receiver sensitivity will also increase the effective communication range, but will also potentially cause malfunction due to interference from other RF devices. The performance of the overall system may be improved by using matched antennas at each end of the communication link, such as those described earlier. Finally, the labeled remote distance of any particular system is normally measured in an open-air line of sight configuration without any interference, but often there will be obstacles such as walls, floors, or dense construction to absorb the radio wave signals, so the effective operational distance will in most practical instances be less than specified.  Module physical connection  Module physical connection: land grid array, through-hole, and castellated boardlet (from left to right) A variety of methods are used to attach an RF module to a printed circuit board, either with through-hole technology or surface-mount technology. Through-hole technology allows the module to be inserted or removed without soldering. Surface-mount technology allows the module to be attached to the PCB without an additional assembly step. Surface-mount connections used in RF modules include land grid array (LGA) and castellated pads. The LGA package allows for small module sizes as the pads are all beneath the module but connections must be X-rayed to verify connectivity. Castellated Holes enable optical inspection of the connection but will make the module footprint physically larger to accommodate the pads.  Wireless protocols used in RF modules RF modules, especially SoC modules, are frequently used to communicate according to a pre-defined wireless standard, including: * Zigbee * Bluetooth Low Energy * Wi-Fi * IEEE 802.15.4 * Z-Wave However, RF modules also frequently communicate using proprietary protocols, such as those used in garage door openers.  Typical applications  * Vehicle monitoring * Remote control * Telemetry * Small-range wireless network * Wireless meter reading * Access control systems * Wireless home security systems * Area paging * Industrial data acquisition system * Radio tags reading * RF contactless smart cards * Wireless data terminals * Wireless fire protection systems * Biological signal acquisition * Hydrological and meteorological monitoring * Robot remote control * Wireless data transmissions * Digital video/audio transmission * Digital home automation, such as remote light/switch * Industrial remote control, telemetry and remote sensing * Alarm systems and wireless transmission for various types of low-rate digital signal * Remote control for various types of household appliances and electronics projects * Many other applications field related to RF wireless controlling * Mobile web server for elderly people monitoring  RF module certification in case of final product integration  Final regulatory product compliance based on an integrated, compliant RF module (as most IoT devices these day's) is a common misunderstanding. A module compliant to the essential requirements of the countries regulation (FCC, CE, ICES, ANATEL etc.) does hardly ever cover the final product. However, this does not mean that full compliance testing is required when integrating a compliant RF module. Integrating a compliant module has a lot of advantages. The RF module is essential in this day’s consumer product but also only a part of the final product. Radio modules have evolved during the years. Onboard voltage regulators, integrated antenna generally try to ensure that the radio phenomena stay the same no matter of their host. You can refer to most RF spectrum measurements on a modular level for compliance when testing and certifying your product at an ISO 17025 accredited EMC, RF laboratory. At the end it is the final product that needs to comply with the regulations. Aspects as health, safety, Radiated susceptibility can not be covered on a modular level.

It was completed in 1932 and opened the following year as a U.S. Public Health Service facility. The lower floors of the facility still function as a medical center today. Amazon.com occupied much of the building as its headquarters from 1999 until 2010. Much of the space was left vacant after Amazon relocated to South Lake Union. In 2013, the state of Washington agreed to a 30-year lease of 13 floors. Seattle Central College subleases six floors for its healthcare training program. The building was designed by Carl Frelinghuysen Gould of Bebb and Gould with assistance from John Graham & Company, and built in a distinctive Art Deco style. The structure is perched on a hill overlooking downtown Seattle and is a prominent part of the city's skyline. It has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places and has been recognized as a landmark by the City of Seattle. The building was retrofitted to better withstand an earthquake in the 1990s; however, portions of the building suffered significant damage during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake. History = Marine Hospital = The building was opened in 1933 by the U.S. government as a U.S. Public Health Service Marine Hospital, replacing a facility in Port Townsend. Upon opening it had a total of 312 beds. The hospital originally served veterans, merchant seamen, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Lighthouse Service, and poor and indigent people defined as \\"federal compensation cases\\". In 1951, it was re-designated as a Public Health Service Hospital along with all other Marine Hospitals. Two years later, a three-story annex was constructed on the east end of the building to serve outpatient clinics. Two stair towers were added to the south face in 1975. The building was further expanded in 1980, when a laboratory and primary care addition were built. = Office building = The federal government ceased operation of the facility and other similar hospitals in 1981. Control was shifted to the City of Seattle, and the city chartered the Pacific Hospital Preservation and Development Authority (PHPDA). The PHPDA owns the property and uses long-term tenants with leases. Lease revenues are to advance the PHPDA's mission of providing health care services to low-income uninsured and under-insured persons in King County. The lease agreement with WRC.Com Tower LLC was signed in 1998 and was terminated in 2012. A $9.3 million county bond paid for seismic improvements between 1991 and 1994. A new tower was constructed on the north side of the building to create a buttress for the original structure. The addition was designed by architects Zimmer Gunsul Frasca, and received an award from the American Institute of Architects for its innovative design that was inline with the building's historical facade. The project created of additional space that was not initially occupied. As the medical organization struggled financially, attempts to lease at least of the building failed over the course of several years. With medical facilities continuing to occupy the bottom two floors of the building in 1998, Amazon.com signed a sublease for $1.5 million a year through 2010. The building on the edge of Beacon Hill The building suffered substantial damage during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake as the structure's upper floor twisted in a corkscrew fashion. On the top three floors, 80 percent of the perimeter walls were damaged. A brick pinnacle on the upper roof collapsed and fell through a roof on the 10th floor. An elevator shaft and five floors were flooded when a mechanical water line ruptured. There were no injuries but it was estimated that the repairs would cost $6 million. During repairs, efforts were made to reuse the brick and terracotta, and the same colors and style were sourced when replacement was needed. Amazon continued to occupy their floors during rehabilitation of the structure. In 2003, the clinical group practice of the PHPDA officially split off to form a 501(c)3 health care organization, PacMed Clinics (doing business as Pacific Medical Centers or PMC). The Pacific Medical Center Clinic continues to operate in the first two floors of the building. In 2010, Amazon.com ended its sub-lease with WRC.Com Tower LLC and began the move of its headquarters to a new campus in the city's South Lake Union neighborhood. Much of the building was left vacant without new tenants moving into the space. The location outside of downtown Seattle was a constraint for businesses. Washington State House Speaker Frank Chopp spearheaded a plan to use government funding to move community college health programs into the building. In August 2013, the PHPDA announced a 30-year lease with the Washington State Department of Commerce for 13 stories of Pacific Tower. Six of the stories will be subleased to Seattle Central Community College for its healthcare training programs. Multiple nonprofits are prospective tenants. Chopp and other state lawmakers planned on consolidating several district offices into the location. The state capital budget allocated $20 million for the tower's renovation, but the cost increased to $54.3 million by the time it was completed in 2016 due to unexpected water damage and new city energy-use regulations. Design An anchor and caduceus from the building's use as a Marine facility Architectural firm Bebb and Gould, assisted by the John Graham Company, designed the original structure. Carl Frelinghuysen Gould designed it in an Art Deco style. Located above sea level at the northern edge of Beacon Hill, the tower overlooks downtown Seattle and Elliott Bay. The building sits on a landscaped property. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. In 1992, the building received landmark status from the city. The northern addition completed in 1994 was considered significant by the American Institute of Architects. It was noted that the exterior of the building could have been supported by new beams and trusses. Instead, the new space integrated almost seamlessly with the original building while being seismically beneficial. In 2017 painter Ari Glass was commissioned to create an installation at the Pacific Tower. Several of his new works will be a permanent addition to the North Entrance of the Pacific Tower. The main building and its surrounding campus are surrounded by manicured grounds. The property includes six buildings near the primary structure. These were originally quarters for officers but have since been converted into laboratory and office space. The buildings are in the same style as the main building with facades that include terracotta ornamental details and brick patterns. Other additions include a parking garage and smaller metal buildings. The property is surrounded by a detailed wrought iron fence.

General background Mindrolling, founded in the Drachi Valley of Central Tibet in 1676 by the Dharma King Chögyal Terdag Lingpa, is originally one the six principal Nyingma monasteries of Tibet. Mindroling lineage holders are traditionally held by the successive descendants of its founder. After the Chinese invasion of 1959, the great masters of this tradition fled to India and the seat of the Mindrolling lineage was then re-established near Dehra Dun in Uttaranchal, India. It now houses one of the largest Buddhist Five Science Colleges in existence today which is under the direction of the current Khenrab lineage holder, Minling Khenchen Rinpoche who is also one of the two current administrators of the Mindrolling Monastery. An unbroken lineage continues up to this day, and Mindrolling is known throughout the Dharma world, both as the lineage and monastery dedicated completely to Dharma activities and as a main center for maintaining the secret Vajrayana Doctrine. Reincarnations According to Tibetan Buddhism Jigmey Namgyal has reincarnated from one generational Minling Khenchen to the next for the last 360 years as the lineage holder of the Khenrab branch of the Mindrolling tradition which originated in Tibet as the holder of the Buddhist teachings and vinayas (precepts developed over time to encourage mindfulness and reflection in actions of body and speech - qualities which enhance mind training and disciplineBechert (1991)). For his current birth, he was confirmed as the reincarnation of the 8th Minling Khenchen Rinpoche, Ngawang Khentse Norbu, by the 14th Dalai Lama, the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa and Lhatog Rinpoche. Being born into the Mindrolling lineage, the Jigmey Namgyal, also known as Khenchen Rinpoche is proceeded by exceptional masters who have held this lineage in the past such as Lochen Dharmashri, Gyalsay Tenpai Nyima and the previous Minling Khenchen mentioned above. Mentoring masters Khenchen Rinpoche has been mentored by Tibetan masters including the 14th Dalai Lama, his uncle the 11th Minling Trichen Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Trulshig Rinpoche, Penor Rinpoche, the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa, and Tulku Ugyen Rinpoche.Farber (2005) p. 28 Ngagyur Nyingma College Ngagyur Nyingma College at Mindrolling Monastery Ngagyur Nyingma College (Five Sciences University) is an institute of advanced Buddhist study for the lineage preservation and spreading of Buddha Dharma. In 1991 the college, one of the largest in India, was inaugurated by Dalai Lama. As Head In-charge, Khenchen Rinpoche presides over this institute, leading a team of Khenpos (a spiritual degree awarded in Tibetan Buddhism after a period of 9 to 15 years of intensive study and considered to be the equivalent of a spiritual doctorate.Mukpo (2006) p. 64). Affiliations Khenchen Rinpoche is “Head Abbot In-Charge” of Ngagyur Nyingma College at Mindrolling Monastery presiding over the administration, education, and disciplines at Mindrolling's Ngagyur Nyingma College. He is the founder of The Eastern Sun Group and, following a mutual merge of two groups, is now Spiritual Advisor to the renowned charitable organization, known as The Eastern Sun Group Lay Buddhists’ Association, Republic of China. As Vice President of the Great Nyingma Monlam (World Peace Prayers), held annually in Bodhgaya, India, Khenchen Rinpoche is the sponsor of the Nyingma event for 2008, 2010, and 2012. Rinpoche continues to teach extensively in Asia, Europe, and North America. Projects The projects dependent on Khenchen Rinpoche continue to require his attention and support, especially the recent reconstruction of the monks' living quarters that is becoming dangerously uninhabitable. Rinpoche's other charitable projects, sustained by contributions and donations from supporters, include the Monlam sponsorship for 2012; the Buddhist Retreat Centre which is located in Thimpu, Bhutan and will have a total of ten rooms and a shrine hall; the Ngagyur Nyingma College Library in memorial of the well-known Mindrolling library in Tibet; and “Project Hope” which will be a school of twenty classrooms aimed at uplifting orphaned and underprivileged children in and around the area of Dehradun, Uttaranchal, India.

As a Millerite Adventist, he experienced the Great Advent Awakening including the Great Disappointment of October 22, 1844. He joined the Sabbath-keeping Adventists in the late 1840s and remained a member until he died 60 years later. He witnessed the SDA Church's development for over a half of a century.Minnesota Seventh-day Adventist Leaders: Minnesota Conference Presidents. Washington Morse.

Accessed April 9, 2011 Morse said that up until January 1844, few people opposed the movement, but that a change in support took place at the beginning of 1844. A misunderstanding arose regarding the end of the time prophecy. Some thought it would end December 31, 1843. Miller had taught that March 21, 1844 would be the end of the 2300 day prophecy of Daniel 8:14. Morse refers to the Advent message of Miller as the first message of Revelation 14. Then, in the early spring of 1844 the second angel's message joined with the loud cry of Revelation 18, and many people left the organized churches.  The Sabbath-keeping Adventists  Following the October 22, 1844 disappointment, he and his wife accepted the message of the sabbatarian Adventists. In 1849, Mr. Camp and his wife, friends of theirs, presented the Sabbath and Ellen White's visions to them. At first, the Morse's felt sorry that the Camps had accepted such 'delusions'. The Camps urged them to find evidence for Sunday sacredness in the Bible. They tried but could not find any and began keeping the Seventh-day Sabbath. This affected their business and its employees. It was on a Friday that they decided to keep the Seventh-day Sabbath; the next day. They quickly informed their employees of the change and had them prepare to close the business at the end of the day.Morse, Washington. \\"Items of Advent Experience During the Past Fifty Years.

In 1850 they began receiving Present Truth published by James White. The Morse's appreciated the White's Biblical stand but they remained skeptical regarding Ellen White's visions. After a meeting at E.P. Butler's in Waterbury, Vermont they accepted Ellen White's ministry. Morse became convinced that her work was in harmony with and prompted by the Spirit of God. He reported that fanaticism was rampant in those early days and that James and Ellen White stood firm against it. This impressed him.

The company provides a platform for freelancers to offer services to customers worldwide.  History  Fiverr's former headquarters in Tel Aviv Fiverr was founded by Micha Kaufman and Shai Wininger, and was launched in February 2010. The founders came up with the concept of a marketplace that would provide a two sided platform for people to buy and sell a variety of digital services typically offered by freelance contractors. Services offered on the site include writing, translation, graphic design, video editing and programming.CrunchBase Profile – Fiverr Fiverr's services start at US$5, and can go up to thousands of dollars with gig extras. Each service offered is called a \\"gig\\". The website was launched in early 2010 and by 2012 was hosting over 1.3 million Gigs. The website transaction volume has grown 600% since 2011. Additionally, Fiverr.com has been ranked among the top 100 most popular sites in the United States and top 200 in the world since the beginning of 2013. On June 1, 2010, Fiverr received a seed investment of US$1 million from Guy Gamzu and other angel investors, and in May 2012, Fiverr secured US$15 million in funding from Accel Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total funding to US$20 million. In December 2013, Fiverr released their iOS app in the Apple App Store, and in March 2014, Fiverr released their Android app in the Google Play store. During August 2014, Fiverr announced that it had raised US$30 million in a Series C round of funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, Accel (formerly known as Accel Partners) and other investors. The round brings their total funding to date to US$50 million. In October 2015, Amazon.com started legal action against 1,114 Fiverr sellers it claims provide fake reviews on the US version of its website. Fiverr did not dispute Amazon's allegations and stated: \\"As Amazon noted, we have worked closely together to remove services that violate our terms of use, and respond promptly to any reports of inappropriate content.\\"Aisha Gani: Amazon sues 1,000 'fake reviewers', The Guardian 18 October 2015 In November 2015, Fiverr announced that it had raised US$60 million in a Series D round of funding, led by Square Peg Capital. The round brings their total funding to date to $110 million. At the same time, the company announced that it was expanding the marketplace to allow sellers the ability to price productized services, known as Gigs, at prices above the original US$5 price. In June 2019, it listed on NYSE. On February 19, 2020, the company reported $107.1 million in revenue for the 2019 fiscal year. = Acquisitions = In 2017, Fiverr acquired video creation marketplace VeedMe. In January 2018, AND CO, maker of software for freelancers, was acquired by Fiverr. CEO Micha Kaufman said at the time that many of AND CO's capabilities, such as invoicing, are \\"baked into\\" the Fiverr marketplace, but \\"the vast majority of freelancing is happening offline\\"—and Fiverr wants to enable those offline relationships. In February 2019, Fiverr acquired premium subscription- based content marketing platform, ClearVoice. Founded in 2014 by Jay Swansson and Joe Griffin, ClearVoice is a venture-backed company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. Adding ClearVoice to the company's portfolio allows Fiverr to conveniently and consistently provide services for independent professionals as well as larger businesses.  Gigs  Fiverr serves to allow listing and applying for small one-off jobs, or gigs, online. Jobs listed on the platform are diverse and range from \\"get a well-designed business card\\" to \\"help with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and jQuery\\". Fiverr is a company built on the model of listing temporary work positions. Freelancers work in a variety of workplaces, ranging from home to office. Fiverr serves as e-commerce platform to freelancers & companies to sell their services by using their gigs. Gig is basically an advertisement of services. Gig include all the details of a services same like ecommerce products The pricing of Gigs depends on how much a seller earns per completed task. The buyers buy services in the form of gigs.  Criticism  Fiverr has received criticism for advertising very cheap graphic services. At the end of 2014, Fiverr's Facebook page advertisement saying \\"You're paying too much for design\\" caused a public outcry. In 2013, Fiverr lifted the five dollar base price and began allowing logo designers, graphic artists, voice over artists and other sellers to charge the base prices they set for themselves. In 2015, after an undercover sting, Amazon filed suit against 1000 Fiverr users over fake product reviews. In 2017, Fiverr was criticized for portraying unhealthy living and excesses in work behaviours as ideals to live up to. Fiverr also gives 100% privileges to buyers thereby neglecting seller rights. After a job has been completed, a buyer has the full rights to request for a refund. Critics argue that Fiverr needs a balance in their equal-rights policy for both sellers as well as buyers. In 2018, Fiverr received an \\"F\\" rating from the Better Business Bureau, which is the lowest grade that can be given. In 2019, Fiverr received a \\"B\\" rating after responding to customer complaints.

Inglis was born in Scotland and immigrated to the United States in 1848, settling in Michigan. In Adrian, Michigan he was converted to the Baptist faith, and shortly after that became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan. In 1854 he began to publish Waymarks in the Wilderness. In this publication he admitted to drawing on the teaching of John Nelson Darby and the Plymouth Brethren in advocating the secret coming of Jesus Christ and the rapture. This is called dispensationalism, but the name is misleading, because it is the secret coming and the removal for a time of the faithful, and not the view that there are different dispensations of the gospel, that distinguishes it from other forms of premillennialism. Inglis would later move to Saint Louis, Missouri and eventually New York City and would continue to publish Waymarks in the Wilderness sporadically until his death.

He sailed from Majorca to find the legendary \\"River of Gold\\" on 10 August 1346, but the outcome of his quest and his fate are unknown. He is memorialized in his native city of Palma, Majorca. Expedition Detail of the Catalan Atlas of 1375 depicting the ship of Jaume Ferrer Very little is known about Jaume Ferrer except that he was a Majorcan captain who set out in a galley in 1346 and sailed down the West African coast in an attempt to reach the legendary \\"River of Gold\\". The results of this expedition, including whether Ferrer survived the journey, are unknown. Some recent research tentatively identifies Jaume Ferrer as \\"Giacomino Ferrar di Casa Maveri\\", a second generation Genoese immigrant in Majorca. Virtually the only information for his expedition is the depiction and note given in the Catalan Atlas of 1375, attributed to the Majorcan cartographer Abraham Cresques (correct patronymic: Cresques Abraham). In the bottom-left corner of the map, there is a brightly painted Aragonese- flagged vessel and a note indicating merely that \\"Jacme Ferrer\\" set out in an uxer on 10 August 1346 to search for the \\"Riu de l'Or\\" (River of Gold).\\"Partic l'uixer d'en Jacme Ferrer per 'nar al Riu de l'Or al jorn de Sent Llorenç qui és a X d'agost e fo en l'any MCCCXLVI\\" An uxer is a single-mast, square-rigged and oar-powered cargo galley, with rounded stern and low prow, commonly used to freight horses.Russell, p.385n The geographic position of the ship (below the Canary Islands) suggests Ferrer probably sailed past Cape Bojador, at that time the non plus ultra of navigation, beyond which European ships dared not sail. If Ferrer survived and returned, then his feat preceded, by nearly a whole century, the famous successful passage of that cape by the Portuguese explorer Gil Eanes in 1434. There is a sliver of additional information found in a note in the secret archives of the Republic of Genoa (uncovered in 1802),First found in Gråberg, G. (1802) Annali di geografia e di statistica, Genoa, vol. II, p.290, the note is unsigned and reads in (garbled) Latin: \\"Recessit de civitate Majorigarum Galeatia una Joannis Ferne catalani, in festo sancti Laurentii quod est in decima die mensis augusti anno Domini 1346, causa eundi ad Rujaura (riu Auri?) et de ipsa Galeatia numquam postea aliquid novum habuerunt. Istud flumen vocatur Vedamel similiter vocatur riu Auri, quia in eo collegitur aurum de paiola. Et scire debeatis quod major pars gentium in partibus istis habitantium sunt electi ad colligendum aurum in ipso flumine, quod habet latitudinem unius legue, et fundum pro majori nave mundi\\". which refers to the expedition, noting that \\"Joannis Ferne\\", a Catalan, left \\"the city of the Majorcans\\" in a galleass on 10 July 1346 but the vessel was never heard of again, that he went searching for the Riu Auri ('River of Gold') because he heard that it was a collection point for \\"aurum de paiola\\" (perhaps \\"gold nuggets\\", but 'Paiola' has also been interpreted not as 'nugget', but as the name of a river island depicted in the 1367 Pizzigani map) that the people on the shores were all engaged in gold collection and that the river was wide and deep enough for the largest ships. The \\"River of Gold\\", frequently spoken of by trans-Saharan traders, was a reference to the Senegal River that flowed into the heart of the gold-producing Mali Empire. The Genoese note refers to it also by the alternative name of Vedamel – almost certainly a derivation from Arabic, probably Wad al-mal ('river of treasure') or possibly, by transcription error, Wad al-Nill ('river of Nile – the Senegal was also long known as the 'Western Nile').The \\"River of Wealth\\" interpretation of Vedamel can be found in J.G.H. \\"'Histoire du commerce entre le Legant et l'Europe' in 1831, Antologia; giornale di scienze, lettere e arti, Vol. 3 (Aug.) p.27. R.H. Major (p.113) proposes the \\"Western Nile\\" interpretation. Vedamel might also be the origin of Budomel, used by early Portuguese explorers in the 15th century to refer to a Wolof statelet on the Grande Côte, south to the Senegal River. Memorials Statue of Jaume Ferrer in Palma Despite the sparse information, Jaume Ferrer is memorialized in his native city of Palma, in Majorca, by a street name, a statue in the Plaça de les Drassanes and a relief in the town hall. The statue is a reproduction of one commissioned by the city hall and sculpted by Jacint Mateu around 1843 but replaced in 1914 by a copy with some modifications by Joan Grauches. The original is in the old Consolat de Mar building in Palma. The Atlas's ship is reproduced on a monumental sundial on the city's maritime promenade.

The band's musical style evolved from a hard rock sound to more of a rap metal sound by the following year. Following the release of \\"The Offering\\" and hit single \\"Nothing Left\\" in 2010, the band was featured by The New Review as one of the fastest rising hard rock acts in the nation. Since their formation, they've completed a national tour with Digital Summer and Universal/Republic records artist 10 Years, released a 5 track EP entitled The Offering, and have had 3 of their songs (Nothing Left, Open My Eyes and The Road) appear on numerous national radio stations, including Sirius XM Radio. The Offering was produced by grammy nominated producer Travis Wyrick (P.O.D., 10 Years, Disciple), who also produced their brand new full length album The War Goes On which came out on December 20, 2011. History =Formation and The Offering (2009-2010)= A Cry Farewell started in December 2009 when lead singer Josh Doyle's wife suggested he meet with guitarist Devon Leonard and start a band. Trevor Metcalf was then invited by Doyle and Leonard to join full time on bass guitar. Still without a drummer, they hired ex-Pillar drummer Lester Estelle II, to record session drums on The Offering. After the recording process, they sought out drummer Danny Hutchinson to round out the line up. The Offering was released on August 31, 2010. For a short period, the band decided to stream mp3 versions of the track for free from the band's website, as part of their \\"Offering\\" to the public. Since then, the band has been featured in HM Magazine, Flip Side to Music magazine, and The New Review. =National tour and upcoming album (2010-present)= In the final months of 2010, the band filmed their official music video for their single Nothing Left. The video was co-written by Doyle and Hutchinson and directed by Hutchinson. Shortly afterwards, the band were guests on a special 2-hour radio interview on Cincinnati's WMWX ClassX. During the interview, the band stated that the new album would be a continuation of The Offering, but a little more on the aggressive side. In February 2011, they embarked on a national tour with Digital Summer and 10 Years in support of their latest album, Feeding the Wolves. After the tour, the band finished writing their upcoming album, which they recorded in spring/summer of 2011. The album, entitled \\"The War Goes On\\" was released on December 20, 2011. In early January 2012, Randy Lorenz was added as a 2nd guitarist to the line up. In March of the same year, bassist Trevor Metcalf announced he would be leaving the band after their CD release show on March 16.

The eastern half of the province is largely covered by Jurassic Period acid volcanic rocks and Cretaceous tuffaceous sandstone. However, there are rocks of a variety of ages including the oldest around 1800 Ma (million years old). The deposits from the Triassic are predominantly on land, whereas the older ones are marine sediments. Prior to the Ediacaran the continent was assembled from several terranes. In the early Paleozoic the environment was a continental slope. In the later Paleozoic the area was a platform, and from the Mesozoic period till now it has been affected by the edge of the Pacific Ocean. Stratigraphy The Badu Group from the Lower Proterozoic consists of biotite schist and gneiss around 1800 Ma and is found noprth of Songxi. The Mayuan Group from middle Proterozoic consists of muscovite schist and includes leptite, marble and graphite beds. =Ediacaran= The Louziba Group in the south west of Fujian consists mostly of sandstone. The Wudan Formation in northwest Fujian contains graywacke and quartz rich sandstone. The Dikou Formation in northeast Fujian contains biotite leptite. The Dingwuling Formation in western Fujian. Longbeixi Formation on eastern Fujian Nanyan Group in southwest has grey phyllite. Huanglian Formation in southwest consists mostly of silicalite. The northwest and east areas are not well differentiated in the Ediacaran, but contain metamorphic rocks such as siltite leptite and actinolite schist. =Cambrian= The Lintian group contains grey metamorphosed sandstone, phyllite and slate up to 4 km thick in western Fujian. The Dongkengkou Group contains metamorphosed calcareous sandstone. It contains Protospongia fossils. Beds are up to 1 km thick. =Ordovician= The Weifang Group contains dark phyllite and limestone with Didymograptus graptolite fossils. The Luofengxi Group contains metamorphosed sandstone in which Leiomarginata and Conochitina incerta fossils have been found. During the Silurian and early Devonian an unconformity formed. =Devonian= The Devonian saw terrestrial deposits. The Tianwadong Formation contained thick conglomerate beds with plant fossils like Cyclostigma and Leptophloem rhombicum. The Taozikeng Formation also contained conglomerate and included Sublepidodendrum fossils. =Carboniferous= The Lindi Formation had more conglomerate and sandstone, with traces of limestone and coal. Plant fossils include Rhodeopteridium and neuropteris. The Huanlong Formation contains clastic limestone and dolomite in the southwest region. There are Fusulid fossils such as Profusulinella, Fusulinella, and Fusulina. The Chuanshan Formation has beds of limestone and dolomite. Montiparus, Titicites and Pseudoschwagerina fossils are found in it. Meanwhile, in the Upper Carboniferous mudstone formed in the northeast of the province. Fossils there include Neospirifer a brachiopod and Neostaffella. =Permian= The Qixia Formation contains dark grey chert interbedded with limestone. The Wenbishan Formation is marine mudstone with phosphate and pyrite nodules. Ammonite fossils such as Altudoceras, Shouchangdoceras are there, and Haydenella a brachipod is also found. The Tongziyan Formation has sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. The upper Permian Cuipingshan Formation has thin beds of sandstone and siltstone and coal. The Dalong Formation has mudstone with limestone lenses in the west. The Changxing formation is primarily limestone. =Triassic= The Triassic contains Xikou, Xiwei, Anren Dakeng Formations followed by a partial unconformity, then Wenbinshan, and Jiaokeng Formation containing conglomerate. The Xikou Formation in Southwest Fujian, consists of a fine grained turbidite. In the areas near Longyan Yongding and Zhangping there are large blocks of oolitic limestone embedded. =Jurassic= The Lishan formation contains sandstone and some acid volcanic particles. The Zhangping formation is mostly purple red siltstone. The Changling Formation contains more volcano derived particles. Nanyuan Formation is the main volcanic strata with up to 8 km thick of intermediate and acid volcanic lava, and tuff. A dinosaur Rhynchosaurus orientalis fossil has been found in this. The Bantou Formation has paper shale and mudstone in the west, and tuff and acid volcanic rock in the east. =Cretaceous= Hekou Formation contains purple-red sandstone and green grey siltstone in the west. Contemporaneously in the east basalt, dacite, rhyolite and quartz trachyte along with sediments derived from these make up the Shimaoshan Group. In the Upper Cretaceous the Shaxian Formation, the Chishi Formation with purple red sandstone is in the west, and Shiniushan Formation contains conglomerate and volcanic particles dated from 88-91 Ma. =Neogene= In the Paleogene surviving deposits were not formed. The Fotan Group formed with Basalt and conglomerate. Volcanic rocks Fujian has two volcanic rock provinces. The East Fujian-Taiwan volcanic rock region includes a strip along the coast. The rest of the province falls into the Zhejiang-Fujian-Guandong volcanic rock region. Both are part of the South China techtono-magmatic province. The Zhejiang-Fujian- Guandong volcanic rocks are mostly rhyolite and dacite rich in potassium, from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. The magmas were formed in an environment first under compression, and later under tension. The East Fujian-Taiwan volcanic rocks in Fujian formed in a continental shelf environment, with alkali basalt erupted around 11.65 Ma on the coast near Fotan. Intrusives Numerous granitic intrusions took place along with the volcanoes in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. Minerals A number of minerals were discovered in Fujian or have their type locations there. Nanpingite comes from the Nanping pegmatite in Zenghe County. It has formula CsAl2(AlSi3O10)OH,F)2 being a cesium mica. Chiluite was found in the Chilu molybdenum deposit in Fu'an County. The formula is Bi3TeMoO10.5. Study The Fujian Geological Museum is in Fuzhou with 1200 square meters of space. A journal called Geology of Fujian (Fujian Dizhi 福建地質) is published by the Fujian Bureau of Geology and Mineral Exploration Geoscience and publishes four issues per year.http://www.oriprobe.com/journals/fujdz.html Geology parks have been set up at Taining. The Zhangzhou Coastal Volcano National Geology Park was established in 2001. Offshore Offshore from the province northern coast is the East China Sea. The sea floor formed by sea floor spreading starting in the Jurassic and continuing to the Pliocene period. The Taiwan Strait off the south coast is actually continental crust beneath. Structure Faults and structure lines are roughly parallel to the coast, northeast-southwest, and reflect interaction with the Pacific Plate. Geophysics =crustal thickness and property at depth= =movement= =Heat flow= Heat flow in the east of Fujian is higher than the west, due to a thinner lithosphere.

The family arms in a wax seal from 2011 Manor house at Tjøtta From Tjøtta Brodtkorb is a Norwegian family. It has its alleged origin in Saxony, Germany. The family first came to Norway in 1643 with Tobias Brodtkorb († 1676), who was a coin-writer (Norwegian: myntskriver) in Akershus and later a customs and export officer in Fredrikstad. His son was Christian Brodtkorb (1653–1701), goldsmith in Oslo, and his grandson was Tobias Brodtkorb (1685–1763), whose three sons established the family's principal branches: * Eilert Christian Brodtkorb (1721–1806), weigher and measurer in Kristiansund. * Christian Johannes Brodtkorb (1725–97), captain and owner of Kirkesæter Farm (Kirkesæter gård) in Hemne. * Niels Gierbrandt Brodtkorb (1729–96), council of justice and owner of Tjøtta Farm (Tjøttagodset) and estate in Alstahaug. Brodtkorb of Tjøtta ;Estate owners The family's most prominent branch was the Brodtkorbs of Tjøttagodset. In 1767, Niels Gierbrandt Brodtkorb purchased the large estate on the island of Tjøtta in Alstahaug. He married Anna Catharina Hvid, who was the daughter of Johan Christian Hvid, owner of the Tromsø estate (Tromsøgodset), and granddaughter of Michael Hvid, who had been the manager of the same estate, originally a part of the Baron of Westervick's estate in Northern Norway. Their son Johan Christian Hvid Brodtkorb (1766–1845) took over the Tjøtta estate. Through his marriage to Maren Winther, who was the daughter of estate owner Niels Winther and Anne Bech at Vevelstad, Brodtkorb extended the property with more land. Thereafter followed their son, Niels Gerbrand Winther Brodtkorb (1792–1865) married to Marie Berg, who was the daughter of Johan Ernst Berg, County Governor of Nordland. Their son was Johan Christian Brodtkorb, who became the last estate owner at Tjøtta. ;Bankruptcy When the last proprietarian, Johan Brodtkorb the younger, died on 3 July 1918, the estate was bankrupt. One sought to let Brodtkorb relatives buy the estate, and in accordance with a property deed of 1867, they had pre-emption to Tjøtta Farm. This attempt did not succeed. The final auction was held in 1929, when the government, represented by the Ministry of Agriculture, bought the farm for 83,000 crowns (90,000 crowns including various fees).Lillegaard, Leif B. and Mentzoni, Steinbjørn (1989): Mellom to kriger Og slik gikk det med storgodset Pag. 377. The manor's interior, however, had been sold one year earlier in an auction lasting for seven days. The manor was then basically emptied for old and valuable objects, thereafter transported to other parts of the country. Among the most precious items were a cabinet from 1627 belonging to Overlord of Helgeland Peter Jacobsen Falch and Anna Jonsdotter of Tjøtta Farm (Tjøtta gard), a collection of over 700 books, whereof many were old and written by hand, and a heraldic artwork displaying the Brodtkorb coat of arms. Also silver, china, and renaissance furniture were sold for relatively low prices.

Probably English, c. 1760. Los Angeles County Museum of Art, M.2007.211.813. ca 1725-1750. Centraal Museum Utrecht 18th century. Amsterdam Museum. Corded quilting (also known as Marseilles quilting, Marseilles embroidery, marcella, or Zaans stitchwork) is a decorative quilting technique popular from the late 17th through the early 19th centuries. In corded quilting, a fine fabric, sometimes colored silk but more often white linen or cotton, is backed with a loosely woven fabric. Floral or other motifs are outlined in parallel rows of running stitches or backstitches to form channels, and soft cotton cord is inserted through the backing fabric using a blunt needle and drawn along the quilted channels to produce a raised effect. Tiny quilting stitches in closely spaced rows fill the motifs and provide contrast to the corded outlines.Takeda and Spilker (2010), pp. 138-39Bath (1979), pp. 226–27Weissman and Lavitt (1987), pp. 74-76 Corded quilting was popular for dresses, petticoats, and waistcoats as well as curtains and bedcoverings. Originating in the fine whole-cloth quilt tradition of Provence in southern France,Weissman and Lavitt (1987), p. 76 corded quilting differs from the related trapunto quilting in which loose wadding or batting rather than cord is inserted to create raised designs. By the Federal era in America, corded quilting and trapunto were combined with whitework embroidery and other needlework techniques to produce a profusion of white-on-white textiles for the home before the fashion faded. The principal areas of production using this technique were southern France and Italy.

Price Memorial Foundation, in 1965, after the 20th century researcher Weston Price who emphasized the importance of nutrition for health and dentistry. The other half of the foundation's current namesake is Francis M. Pottenger, Jr. whose study of nutrition in cats sparked interest in a diet high in raw animal products including uncooked meats and unpasteurized dairy. In 1969, after Price's death, the organization became the Price Pottenger Foundation, and then the Price Pottenger Nutrition Foundation. PPNF primarily advocates: 1) that consumption of animal fats is not dangerous to human health, and 2) that mainstream agricultural methods which emphasize the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides as well as factory farming and significant processing of whole foods, reduces overall nutritional quality of food and human health. The first set of claims go against the mainstream scientific consensus among researchers, doctors, and nutritionists, that a diet high in saturated fat presents serious risks to cardiovascular health and longevity. The second set of claims is aligned with the increasingly popular organic food movement, although major food growers and producers consistently affirm the taste and nutritional quality of their food as identical or better than organics. PPNF now houses over 10,000 books and publications, including the works of Dr. Royal Lee, Dr. Melvin Page, Dr. Emanuel Cheraskin, Dr. William Albrecht, and others. It owns and protects the copyright to the works by Price and Pottenger. They continue to republish Price's Nutrition and Physical Degeneration, and Pottenger's Pottenger's Cats – A Study in Nutrition.  Key individuals  =Weston Price= Price was a dentist from Cleveland, Ohio, whose 1939 book, Nutritional and Physical Degeneration,Weston A. Price, DDS, Nutrition and Physical Degeneration, 8th ed. (2008), & describes the fieldwork he did in the 1920s and 1930s among various world cultures, with the original goal of recording and studying the dental health and development of pre- industrial populations. =Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.= Pottenger was a doctor whose 1932-1942 Pottenger Cat Study addressed the nutritive value of heat- labile elements — nutrients destroyed by heat and available only in raw foods. He used donated laboratory cats to test the potency of the adrenal extract hormones he was making. The adrenal glands of these cats were removed for the experiments, usually resulted their death. But Pottenger noted that most of the cats died during or following the operation. He was feeding the cats a supposedly nutritive diet consisting of raw milk, cod liver oil and cooked meat scraps of liver, tripe, sweetbread, brains, heart and muscle. When the number of donated cats exceeded the supply of food available, Pottenger began ordering raw meat scraps from a local meat packing plant, including organs, meat, and bone; and fed a separate group of cats from this supply. Within months this separate group appeared in better health than the cooked meat group. Pottenger conducted subsequent studies involving approximately 900 cats over a period of ten years, with three generations of cats studied. His experiments showed that cats were healthiest after being fed raw meat and raw dairy. =Pat Connolly= Marion Patricia (\\"Pat\\") Connolly was the curator for PPNF. She studied health and nutrition for over 66 years and lectured on a variety of nutritional subjects. According to the PPNF, she was the foremost authority on the work of Price and Pottenger. In 1962 she took a course on nutrition by Alfreda Rooke, then Curator of PPNF, who had studied under Price. In 1972, she became a PPNF Nutrition Instructor, teaching Rooke's course. She wrote several books, including Dietotherapy (The Kelley Research Foundation), Mini Guide To Living Foods, The Guide to Living Foods (PPNF), Food Alive (Livingston-Wheeler Medical Clinic), A Modern Approach to the Primitive Diet (Nero), and The Candida-Albicans Yeast-Free Cookbook (McGraw Hill). She was also listed as a co-author of the first edition of Nourishing Traditions. She died in November 2010. =George Meinig= In 1994 George E. Meinig published Root Canal Cover-up Exposed which resurrected Price's old studies. Regarding the book, Hasselgren in New York Academy of Dentistry's Annals of dentistry stated \\"[t]he focal infection theory, supported by many including Dr. Price, has been attacked, debated, accepted, criticized, agreed upon, etc. but it has not been covered up.\\" Hasselgren noted that Meinig would sometime confuse the meanings of \\"infection\\" and \\"inflammation\\" and based all his work on Price's 1923 Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic book.Hasselgren, Gunnar (1994) Annals of dentistry: Volumes 53-54 New York Academy of Dentistry pg 42) Hasselgrenalso observed: \\"the work of Dr. Weston Price is therefore still to a great extent valid and important and the role of infection can not be underestimated.\\" Meinig died in May 2008 at the age of 93. Publications and education The PPNF houses an archive of books related to Price and Pottenger's work as well as the works of authors in related fields. It publishes its own journal, the Journal of Health and Healing. They also sell a variety of books, DVD, and CDs, publish an online newsletter, and offer classes.

He was a District Judge and was an Acting Queen’s Advocate. Born to a Burger family, Lorensz was educated at the Colombo Academy, winning the Turnour Prize in 1846 with Frederick Nell. Beginning his legal practice in 1849, he became a barrister at the Lincoln's Inn in 1855. He was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon Branch . After serving as the District Judge of Chilaw in 1855, he went back to being a practicing lawyer. He was appointed as a Burger non-official member of Legislative Council of Ceylon from 1856 to 1864, as opposed to the official members, who held their seats in the council by virtue of their offices in government. He was the first non-official member to claim and receive the right of introducing a private bill. An advocate for local government, he played a major role in the establishment of the Colombo Municipal Council, the first municipality, of which he was one of the first elected members from 1860 to 1870. He resigned from the Legislative Council in 1864. Lorensz was credited with being the architect of the currency ordinance which enacted that Ceylon should switch from the British currency to its own of rupees and for coining the term Ceylonese. He played a major role in the reform and development of education, the amendment and codification of the law, and the inauguration of the Ceylon Government Railway. In 1859, Lorensz and a syndicate purchased the Examiner, which was renamed as the Ceylon Examiner, thus becoming the first Ceylonese newspaper, of which he was the managing editor. He was part of the Macaulay of Ceylon along with James De Alwis, Frederick Nell and his brother Louis, John Prins, Charles Ferdinands and Dandris de Silva Gunaratna inspired by the Young England movement.

Early years and background Gibbons was born and raised in Woronora in the Sutherland Shire and worked as a real estate agent before becoming a development manager for Technical Aid to the Disabled. She also formerly worked for various state and federal politicians. Political career Elected to the Sutherland Shire Council in 2004 as an independent candidate, Gibbons was, at one stage, deputy mayor. Having previously sought endorsement in 2007, Gibbons was endorsed as a candidate for the Liberal Party in 2010. At the March 2011 elections, Gibbons was elected and received a swing of 27.1 points, winning 74.4 per cent of the two-party vote. She won 61 percent of the primary vote, enough to win the seat without the need for preferences. Alison Megarrity, the incumbent Labor member, did not seek re-election. Gibbons' main competitor was Peter Scaysbrook. Menai was among the first seats claimed as won by the Coalition on election night; according to Gibbons, it was the very first seat the Coalition took off Labor in its landslide victory. In 2012, Gibbons pleaded guilty and was sentenced, without a recorded conviction, for failure to comply with Election Funding Authority regulations regarding the submission of political donation returns for 2010, when she was a Sutherland Shire Councillor. For the 2015 NSW Election, the New South Wales Electoral Commission undertook the process of redistributing electoral boundaries. In this process, Gibbons' seat of Menai was abolished, and replaced with the redrawn seat of Holsworthy, encompassing more of the City of Liverpool than previously. Gibbons won the new seat with a reduced margin of 6.7%, despite a 4% swing to Labor. When first elected in 2011, Gibbons served as a Temporary Speaker in the Legislative Assembly. After the 2015 election, in addition to her Temporary Speaker position, Gibbons also was appointed the Chair of the Committee for Children and Young People and as the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on the Office of the Valuer-General. At the 2019 NSW State Election, Gibbons retained the seat of Holsworthy.  Controversy  In June 2018, media reported that Gibbons had “skipped question time” to attend a “local branch meeting”. In April 2019, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that members of Gibbons's staff had edited her Wikipedia page to promote a favourable political image, following her promotion within the Berejiklian ministry.

Formation and mineral content  Fruchtschiefer is formed under very low pressure (low grade metamorphic rock) and temperatures of ca. 500 °C. At these temperatures cordierite grows to the size of grains of corn, which is where its name comes from; Frucht being German for \\"corn\\" (as well as \\"fruit\\"). It contains the following minerals: cordierite, muscovite, potassium feldspar, quartz, biotite and hornblende.  Occurrence  Fruchtschiefer occurs in Germany as contact metamorphic rock in the Harz, Ore Mountains, Odenwald and Vogtland. The best known deposits are those near Theuma and Tirpersdorf dating to the Ordovician. Rocks quarried here have been used well beyond the local region.  Use  The main traditional application is in the form of rough split masonry products of a wide variety. Fruchtschiefer from Theuma is also split or ground for use as facade slabs and plinth facings. Amongst the architectural components made in this material are window and door surrounds, columns and steps. Occasionally it is used for artistic or sculptural purposes. It was also used as canal lock and well covers as well as containers for galvanised baths and acids. The use of Theuma Fruchtschiefer can be traced back to the Middle Ages. Examples include slabs in the crypt of St. John's Church in Plauen (built 1122), which date to the 14th century.  References  * Georg Dehio: Handbuch der Deutschen Kunstdenkmäler, Sachsen.

It was released on October 28, 2011. The film garnered negative reviews from critics, and was a box office bomb. Plot Two FBI agents are conducting surveillance at a warehouse. As U.S. Senator Dennis Darden (Ed Kelly) walks out of the door, he is approached by an assassin from behind who slits his throat and escapes. The agents rush to the scene to find the man dead. However, they could not identify the assassin as he committed the murder in darkness. Later, CIA officers arrive on the scene and take charge. Retired operative Paul Shepherdson (Richard Gere) is summoned by CIA director Tom Highland (Martin Sheen) to look into the murder. He is introduced to a young FBI agent, Ben Geary (Topher Grace) who is an expert on a former Soviet operative known as Cassius. Geary reasons that Cassius is the assassin due to his signature throat-slitting (garrotting) method. Paul and Ben visit Brutus (Stephen Moyer), one of Cassius's proteges, who is locked up in prison, to learn the whereabouts of Cassius. They provide him with a radio and leave. The prisoner then swallows the batteries from the radio and fakes a poisoning/upset stomach. Upon arriving at a hospital, he regurgitates and spits out the batteries, overpowers the medical staff, and escapes. In the basement's garage, he is attacked by Paul, who reveals himself to be Cassius himself, the very operative who had previously trained the fugitive. Cassius slits his throat. He then moves to eliminate Ben too, only stopping when interrupted by Ben's wife—Cassius is unable to murder Geary in front of his family. Upon investigating the crime scene, Ben grows increasingly suspicious of Paul. Meanwhile, a Russian terrorist and murderer, Bozlovski (Tamer Hassan), has entered the U.S. As the investigation deepens, Paul warns Ben to pull out, due to the possibility of harm not only to himself but his family. Ben, who has become obsessed with the idea that Paul is Cassius, starts his own parallel investigation. Meanwhile, Paul tries to contact Bozlovski in a factory where he escapes after an intense firefight. Ben examines another throat-slitting murder of Bozlovski's associate at the same site and is now convinced Paul is indeed Cassius. Ben pieces together the events of Paul's life and determines that not only is Paul actually Cassius, but also that he is systematically murdering the people involved in the death of his wife and child, who were assassinated by Bozlovski. Paul has now tracked down Bozlovski to a shipyard warehouse. A while later, Ben also arrives at the building. After being confronted with the evidence, Paul confesses everything. Paul then confronts Ben with the fact that Ben is a Russian spy, which Paul learned at one of Ben's informant drop-offs. He is able to convince Ben that Bozlovski is the actual threat. When Ben reveals that he has plans to return to Russia after this is over, Paul tries to convince him to stay in the FBI and with the family he has grown to love. Together they hunt down Bozlovski inside the shipyard's warehouse. Bozlovski attacks Paul and Ben, and in the ensuing struggle, a mortally wounded Paul slits Bozlovski's throat using his garrote- watch. However, Paul himself later succumbs to his own injuries. As the only witness, FBI agent Ben relays the incident to his superiors and claims that Bozlovski was Cassius, thereby securing Paul's reputation and recognizing his heroism. As Ben departs, the CIA director Highland asks him whether he would ever consider working at the CIA. The film ends with Ben returning to his home as a now-defected man who is no longer a double agent.

Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave note of Brandt's scripting of the story, saying that \\"questionable motives and unbelievable decisions are relatively small potatoes compared with the Sputnik-size plotholes.\\" She also gave credit to his style of direction for having \\"sweeping shots of the nation's capital, along with some claustrophobic shots that add anxiety to early scenes\\" but said that \\"It's not enough to boost up this botched attempt to tinker with something that, while predictable, is at least dependable.\\" Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic criticized Brandt's direction and screenwriting for lacking any \\"menace or mystery to the proceedings\\" and its two main leads' characters for having no chemistry and feeling by-the numbers, saying that, \\"With its convoluted plot and fading stars, The Double feels like a straight- to-DVD feature that somehow sneaked onto the big screen. It's simply not very good.\\" In a review for the A.V. Club, Noel Murray gave the film a \\"C−\\". He felt that Brandt and Haas waste their premise by setting it up like \\"a typical episode of any basic-cable action series\\" saying that \\"while it holds a few surprises, the twists feel writerly, not organic.\\" Roger Ebert highlighted Gere's \\"subtle catlike body language\\" in his performance that displays his well-worn screen presence but was critical of Brandt and Haas's script containing thriller clichés and \\"familiar action-movie tropes\\" compared to their previous effort 3:10 to Yuma, concluding that it \\"doesn't approach it in terms of quality. None of it is particularly compelling. Most of the time we're waiting for the other shoe to drop. When, very late in the film, the screenplay comes up with a third shoe, that's going too far.\\" Paste writer Annlee Ellingson gave the film praise for being \\"a throwback genre flick, complete with a throwback lead that gives away its double cross early yet maintains enough mystery to keep viewers moderately intrigued.\\" References External links * 2011 films 2011 directorial debut films 2011 crime thriller films 2011 independent films 2010s spy thriller films American crime thriller films American films American independent films American spy thriller films English-language films Films about the Federal Bureau of Investigation Films about murderers Films about terrorism in the United States Films about the Central Intelligence Agency Films set in Washington, D.C.

It is located at Piddle Brook. North Piddle is a historic parish and a few of the parish's structures have been designated as listed buildings by English Heritage, because they are structures of special architectural and historic interest. In 1924 of land were designated to North Piddle – 422 acres (171 ha) were grassland, and the rest was arable land. The field names that are mentioned in the document dating back to the 16th century include Frarye Acre, Husband Acre, Monck Acre, Le Home, Le Deane and Gostell Field. At the 1821 census there were 133 inhabitants living in the parish, and in 1851 slightly more, at 149. , there are 80 people living in North Piddle. Origin of the name William Henry Dugan, in his book Worcestershire Place Names, states that although the word \\"Piddle\\" is not listed in any Anglo-Saxon dictionary, it is found in a few places in Anglo-Saxon charters. Dugan believes that the word \\"Piddle\\" is an old English word for a small stream. North Piddle was named after Piddle Brook, on which it stands. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. History Domesday Book's records of the great survey of much of England and parts of Wales, completed in 1086, mentions two estates in North Piddle, both of which were held for the abbey of Westminster by Urse d'Abetot. Through the ages North Piddle manor was connected to many notable and colourful figures, including the Dukes of Norfolk. Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, was banished from England and died of the \\"pestilence\\" (bubonic plague) in Venice in 1399. His son and heir Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk was beheaded in 1405, and the manor was taken into family ownership and granted for life to Edward Beauchamp. A few years later the manor was once again owned by the Dukes of Norfolk, but the direct line was broken when Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk, who was married when she was 5 years old to Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, died three years after her marriage. Her husband was murdered in the Tower of London soon after. In 1868 the parish was divided into small farms and by 1924 the manorial rights had lapsed. The Greenwood brothers' Worcestershire Delineated (1822) says of the parish: St Michael's Church The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland (1868) says: St Michael's, the parish church of North Piddle, was originally built in 1289 but almost nothing survives of the old building; the church was rebuilt in 1876. On 17 December 1896 there was an earthquake in the region that \\"exceeded in violence any previous instance of seismic energy there within the present century.\\" The earthquake was preceded by a loud roar \\"as of thunder\\" or \\"a rushing mighty wind\\", and residents whose windows were facing north saw a \\"great light\\", which some attributed to a large meteor.The Times, Friday 18 December 1896; pg. 9; Issue 35077; col E This was probably an earthquake light.

The film was inspired by tire rationing.  Plot summary  Gilin is a gangster who has just gotten out of prison. One night while driving home with his girlfriend Nikki, he collides with defense workers Bill Barry and Mary Dale. Bill's tires are destroyed, and when the insurance company is unable to replace them, Nikki convinces him to exchange Bill's car for the car of Gilin's Chinese servant Tom, who has enlisted in the Army. With government restrictions on rubber in place due to the war, Gilin goes into business stealing and re-selling good tires, then sells tires retreaded with cheap synthetic rubber to used-car lots. One of Gilin's retreads blows out and causes the death of Mary's brother. Bill and his co-workers become determined to find the culprit behind the shoddy tires.

Telangana region politics  Khan holds a very important position in the politics of Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh, especially after the Jamaat's stand on the Telangana movement. He leads the Muslims' struggle for a separate Telangana. He said during a public meeting called 'Telengana Garjana' that successive state governments had neglected the Telangana region in basic sectors such education, employment, irrigation and industries – not kept many promises made at the time of merger for the development of the region. In the public meeting, which was organised by the state chapter of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind at the Nizam College grounds in Hyderabad on 7 February 2010, Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao expressed that Muslims would not be assured of social justice unless they got political reservation.

He regards Telangana \\"a victim of injustice\\" since the formation of Andhra Pradesh. MM Khan along with party workers in Hyderabad celebrating after Lok Sabha cleared T-Bill on 18 February 2014.  T-Bill (AP Reorganisation Bill)  After decades long struggle of people of Telangana region, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha cleared the T-Bill allowing bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, which will result in formation of Telangana as 29th State of India.

While advocating for effective legislation and strict implementation of laws for the protection of women's modesty, Khan echoed for severe punishment for the culprits. He said WPI gives women political platform and encourages them to take up active part in social and political affairs.  2009 general elections  In 2009, Khan met the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Dr. Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy along with other Jamaat-e-Islami Hind representatives to inform Reddy of the organisation's support for Indian National Congress (Congress Party) in 2009 General Elections in the Indian state. Prior to announcing the support, Khan launched a 10-day campaign which included Jamaat-e-Islami Hind's public meetings, symposiums and seminars to mobilise public opinion regarding the elections. While addressing a press conference, he said \\"At the end of the campaign, we will announce our support to a political party.\\" Khan also urged political parties in the state not to support fascist forces and chalk out plans to provide basic amenities such as food, clothes and housing to all the poor. In addition, he stressed on the need for strengthening rural economy and agrarian sector.  On 4% quota for Muslims  The state government's decision, announced in July 2007, to grant Muslims 4% reservations in the public sector and educational institutions had received mixed reactions from the local political community. Khan labelled the decision of the Andhra Pradesh government as a \\"placatory step\\" toward easing the critical conditions of the Muslims community.  Israel attack on Gaza  While condemning the brutal attack on Flotilla, Khan considered Israel as the biggest threat to the peace-loving world and urged then ruling Indian government to severe diplomatic relationship with that country immediately. In addition, he asked Arab world to come forward and put diplomatic pressure on Israel to end Gaza siege.  Political comments  Commenting on the hanging of Afzal Guru, Khan called it a \\"political drama\\" and noted that the implementation of the judgment was not humanitarian and fair.  Homosexuality  Khan applauded Supreme Court's judgment against Homosexuality considering it to be harmful to the society. He believes that this judgment would help in preventing spread of Homosexuality. He also noted that the judgment has encouraged traditions, culture and values of Indian society. Moreover, he felt the need to stop propaganda of Homosexuality in media and urged for a ban on this propaganda in the name of entertainment.

Kaupanger Manor in Sogndal Joachim de Knagenhielm (1727-1796) Knagenhjelm (also spelled Knagenhielm in Denmark, often romanised Knagenhelm ) is a Danish and Norwegian noble family originating in Norway. Origin The family descends from Niels Tygesen Knag (1661–1737) (later Niels Tygesen Knagenhielm), who was an attorney and lagmann of the Bergen appeals court. He grew in wealth and owned the estates of Kaupanger (Kaupanger Hovedgård) and Stedje (Storgarden Stedje) in Sogndal and an estate on Losna (Losna-ætta). Niels Tygesen Knag was the son of district magistrate Tyge Nielssøn Castberg (ca. 1610–1687) from Kalø in Jutland and Maren Nielsdatter Knag, the daughter of Niels Knag, district magistrate on Sunnmøre. The current Norwegian family Castberg also descends from this couple. The surname Knagenhielm was granted when on 21 December 1721, Niels Tygesen Knag was ennobled by King Christian VI. He married twice, first in 1695 with Abel Margrethe Hansdatter (1676-1701), daughter of customs official Hans Clausen and Ingeborg Lem, and in 1702 Veronica Elisabeth Hiort (d. 1713), daughter of Hans Christoffersen Hiorth (d. 1692), Nordenfjells country commissioner. He had descent through his first marriage including his grandson, Joachim de Knagenhielm (1727-1796) who served as County Governor of Nordre Bergenhus (1763-1771) and of Nordland (1771-1789). Knagenhielm descendants still own Kaupanger Manor (Kaupanger Hovedgård) in Sogn og Fjordane and are included in the Yearbook of the Danish Nobility (Danmarks Adels Aarbog). Coat of arms Before he became noble, Niels Tygesen Knag had only a tree trunk as his arms (Hans Krag. 1942). The coat of arms was received upon the ennoblement in 1721. Description without the heraldic terminology: On a blue shield a tilted, chopped and knotty silver tree trunk beside or above which there are three golden stars in each of two bends. On the helmet is a six-pointed star between two buffalo horns divided in gold and blue, vice versa, respectively. Some family members use also an oak leaf on the tree trunk.

Hosted by physicist Brian Cox and comedian Robin Ince, The Independent described it as a \\"witty and irreverent look at the world according to science\\". The show's eighth series was broadcast in June and July 2013 and the podcast, published immediately after the initial radio broadcast, features extended versions of most episodes starting with 1 July 2013 Glastonbury Special episode in Series 8. The programme won a Gold Award in the Best Speech Programme category at the 2011 Sony Radio Awards, and it won the best Radio Talk Show at the 2015 Rose d'Or awards. The name is a reference to the infinite monkey theorem. Each show has a particular topic up for discussion, with previous topics including the apocalypse and space travel. There are normally three guests; two of these are scientists with an interest in the topic of discussion, offering an expert opinion on the subject. The other guest is usually a comedian, who takes a less serious view of the subject, and often makes the show more accessible by asking the 'stupid' questions that the other guests may have overlooked. Ince and Cox headed an Uncaged Monkeys live tour in 2011, and toured the United States in 2015. In April 2018 a book titled Infinite Monkey Cage - How to Build a Universe was released. Its audiobook was read by Cox and Ince. Humour The programme features a number of running themes and gags. Robin Ince regularly pokes fun of Brian Cox's hair, good looks, and former career as a rock musician. Ince often imitates and quotes Carl Sagan. Cox often ridicules chemistry, astrology, Creationists and occasionally returns to the subject of how and when a strawberry can be considered dead. Theme song The programme's theme song was written by Eric Idle and recorded by Idle and Jeff Lynne.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bn0gp The Infinite Monkey Cage, season 10, episode 4. Eric Idle states that Jeff Lynne played all the instruments on the recording.

Her life has been portrayed in many Korean historical dramas. Biography Born into the Yeoheung Min clan, she was the second daughter of Min Yu-jung (Hangul: 민유중, Hanja: 閔維重)Entitled as \\"Internal Prince Yeoyang\\" (여양부원군). (1630–1687) and his second wife, Lady Eunseong of the Eunjin Song clan.Entitled as \\"Lady Eunseong, Princess Consort to the Internal Prince\\" (Hangul: 은성부부인) She married King Sukjong as his second Queen Consort in 1681, at the age of 14. When so-uiSo-ui is the 3rd highest title for a King's concubine. Jang Ok-jeong produced a son in 1688, it created a bloody dispute called Gisa literati purges (기사사화). During this time, Sukjong wanted to give this eldest son (entitled the wonja, literally the \\"First Son\\") the title of \\"Crown Prince\\" and wanted to promote Lady Jang from So-ui to Hui- bin.Bin (translated as \\"Royal Noble Consort\\") is the highest title for a King's concubine, just under the Queen. This action was opposed by the Noron faction, who supported Queen Inhyeon led by Song Si- yeol,http://academic.naver.com/view.nhn?doc_id=16555216&dir;_id=0&page;=0&query;=Gisa%20Hwanguk&ndsCategoryId;=10102&library;=94 and this was supported by the Soron faction, who supported Lady Jang. Sukjong became angry at the opposition, and many were killed, including Song Si-yeol. Many, including Inhyeon and her family, were forced into exile. Queen Inhyeon was deposed, while Jang so-ui became Jang hui-bin, and then became the third Queen Consort. Later in 1694, Sukjong, feeling remorse at his temperamental actions by the urging of his new favorite Choe Suk-bin, gave in to a movement for Inhyeon's reinstatement, which was led by the Soron (this event was called the Gapsul Hwanguk (갑술환국,甲戌換局)) She was brought back to the palace and was reinstated as Queen Consort, with Lady Jang being demoted to hui-bin. In 1701, aged 34, she became ill and died of an unknown disease (some sources say that she was poisoned). It has been said that Sukjong, while mourning for Inhyeon, dreamed of her in a sobok dress drenched with blood. Sukjong asked Inhyeon of how she died, but Inhyeon didn't say anything, but pointed in to the direction of Jang Hui-bins chambers.https://archive.org/stream/historyofkorea02hulbuoft#page/160/mode/2up Sukjong awoke, then went into Jang's chambers. While approaching, he heard music and sounds of laughter. Eavesdropping, he saw Jang Hui-bin with Shamanist priestesses in her chambers, praying for the Queen's death, while striking a figurine with arrows. When this was discovered by Sukjong, Lady Jang was executed for her actions by poison.https://archive.org/stream/historyofkorea02hulbuoft#page/156/mode/2up One of the Queen's ladies in waiting wrote a book called Inhyeon Wanghu Jeon (Hangul: 인현왕후전, Hanja: 仁顯王后傳, Queen Inhyeon's Story), which still exists today. She is buried in Myeongreung (명릉,明陵) in Gyeonggi Province, and Sukjong was later buried near her in the same area. She has no issue to Sukjong.

She was the mother of King Gyeongjong of Joseon. Biography =Early life= Her personal name was Jang Ok-jeong (張玉貞; 장옥정). She was the daughter of Jang Hyeong (張炯) and his second wife Lady Yoon of the Papyeong Yun clan (坡平尹氏). She is widely thought to be one of the most beautiful women in Joseon, and her charm was mentioned in the Annals. She belonged to the chungin class or middle class and came from a long line of interpreters. Ok-jeong became a lady-in-waiting to Grand Queen Dowager Jaui (King Injo's second queen) at the recommendation of Prince Dongpyeong (King Sukjong's first cousin once removed). =As royal concubine= Visiting his step-great-grandmother (Grand Dowager Queen Jaui), King Sukjong met Jang and became infatuated with her beauty. He gave her the rank of Favored Sang-gung, which indicated that she was favored by the King. The King's mother, Queen Mother Hyeonryeol, belonged to the Noron faction, and she feared that Lady Jang would influence the Ming to favor her native Soron faction so she expelled her from the palace. In 1683, the Queen Mother died and Queen Inhyeon (Sukjong's Queen and lawful wife) allowed Lady Jang to return to court. In 1686, she became Sukjong's concubine with the rank of Suk-won (숙원, 淑媛).Suk-won is the 8th ranking title for a King's concubine. In 1688, she was elevated to the rank of So-ui (소의, 昭儀) after giving birth to the King's first son (the future King Gyeongjong). The Soron faction pushed for the King to acknowledge Lady Jang's son as his heir apparent, but the Noron faction insisted that Queen Inhyeon was still young and could bear a son, who should be heir. The King pushed for a compromise in which Queen Inheyon would adopt Gyeongjong as her son. However, Queen Inhyeon refused to adopt do so. This split in the court created a bloody dispute and upheaval known as the Gisa Hwanguk. The Soron faction seized power, and they exiled Queen Inheyon, her father, and the leaders of the Noron faction. In 1688, Lady Jang was elevated to the 1st senior rank of Bin (빈, 嬪), with the prefix \\"Hui\\", which means \\"beautiful\\". =As queen consort= In 1688, Queen Inhyeon was exiled from the palace, and Jang was elevated to the position of Queen. In 1694, Jang Hui-bin lost the favor of the King.(Book East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History, 3rd pag. 255 The King grew disgusted by the greed of the Soron faction and the ever- powerful Jang family. He began favoring Lady Choi (later Choi Suk-bin), who openly supported the deposed Queen Inhyeon and encouraged him to reinstate her to her original position as Queen. =Later years= The King banished Jang's older brother and the leaders of the Soron party. He officially demoted Jang to the rank of Hue-Bin, and he reinstated Queen Inhyeon as his Queen and brought her back into the palace. In 1701, Queen Inhyeon died of an unknown disease. Allegedly, Sukjong discovered Jang Hui-bin conspiring with a shaman priestess to curse the Queen with black magic and gloating over her death. The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong Page 246 The Soron faction pleaded with the King to show mercy and pointed out that she was the mother of the Crown Prince. Unmoved, the King sentenced Jang, her mother, her brother, and all of her companions to death. He also killed the leaders of Soron (her political faction) in response; 1700 people died as result of the incident. He exiled the courtiers who had asked him not to execute Jang. On the 7th day of the 10th month in the 27th year of his reign (7 November 1701), Sukjong passed a decree prohibiting concubines from becoming Queens Consort. On 9 November (the 9th day of the 10th lunar Month) 1701, Jang was executed by poison at Chwi Seon Dang, her royal residence inside Changdeok Palace. She was 42 years old. Jang Hui-bin was known for her greed for power and the position of Queen. Some argue that she was a victim of the political struggles of the time. As a member of the losing Soron party, she may be portrayed in a deliberately negative light. For example, some claim that she severely wounded her son (the Crown Prince (future King Gyeongjong)), making it impossible for him to produce an heir. In fact, she would have desperately wanted her son to be able to sire heirs and become king, so she probably wouldn't have attacked her son in such a manner. She was buried in Daebinmyo tomb in Seooreung (Address: 334-92, Seooreung-ro, Deogyang-gu, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do). Originally entombed in Munhyeong-ri Opo-myeon Gwangju-gun Gyeonggi-do, she was moved to Daebinmyo in June 1969. Her memorial tablet was enshrined in Daebingung at Chilgung or \\"Palace of 7 Royal Concubine\\". As the mother of the Crown Prince, she was given the posthumous title \\"Lady Oksan, Great Concubine of the Palace; Prefectural Great Concubine of the Indong Jang clan\\" (대빈궁옥산부대빈장씨 大嬪宮玉山府大嬪張氏). =Jang's Tomb: Daebinmyo= Daebinmyo is a myo type tomb. She was originally entombed in Munhyeong-ri Opo-myeon Gwangju-gun Gyeonggi-do but was moved to its current location in June 1969, because the government was trying to expand the city and her tomb was in the way. Jang Hui-bin's tomb, Daebinmyo, was relocated at Seooreung tombs where Myeongreung is (명릉; reung refers to Kings and Queens tombs) and contains the tombs of King Sukjong, Queen Inhyeon, and Queen Inwon. Behind the tomb is a large rock and a pine tree has broken through the rock to grow. There is speculation that this reveals that Jang Hui-bin's ki (energy) was, and still is, very strong. Some Korean websites report that because Jang Hui-bin was such a strong woman there is a belief that if young single women who want a boyfriend visit Jang Hui-bin's tomb and pay a tribute, they will soon find love.

It is located in the City of Playford. In the local Kaurna dialect, Munno Para means golden wattle creek. The name refers to either the Gawler River (which starts at the confluence of the South Para River and North Para River) or the Little Para River from which the much larger cadastral Hundred of Munno Para derives its name. History Until 1997, Munno Para was part of the City of Munno Para, formerly the district councils of Munno Para East and Munno Para West which were established in 1853 on land bounded by the cadastral Hundred of Munno Para. The older part of the suburb itself began from a subdivision in 1955 and the suburb was named in 1978. Until the locality was urbanised from 1955, Munno Para was part of the farming township of Smithfield. The Playford Alive development began in the 2000s, establishing urban development in Munno Para to the west of the railway line, centred initially on Coventry Road, then establishing a new \\"town centre\\" with shops and commercial development along Curtis Road and Peachey Road extended north of Curtis Road into the suburb. Geography The suburb lies northeast of Elizabeth and Smithfield. The original part of Munno Para is basically rectangular in shape, lying lengthwise between the Gawler railway line and Main North Road. More recent development on the western side of the railway line is also in the suburb of Munno Para. The entire suburb is fairly flat, sloping slightly down to the west and south. The only road across the railway line in Munno Para is Curtis Road along the southern boundary of the suburb. Pedestrians can also cross at the Munno Para railway station. Main North Road runs along the eastern boundary, Stebonheath Road along the western boundary. Coventry Road historically was parallel and halfway between these two, however the suburban development has introduced some bends for traffic calming on this route. Demographics The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 1,754 persons in Munno Para on census night. Of these, 49.2% were male and 50.8% were female. The majority of residents (74.7%) are of Australian birth, with 12.9% declaring England as their country of birth. The average age of Munno Para residents is slightly lower than the greater Australian population. 60.4% of residents were over 25 years in 2006, compared to the Australian average of 66.5%; and 39.6% were younger than 25 years, compared to the Australian average of 33.5%. Community The local newspaper is the News Review Messenger. Other regional and national newspapers such as The Advertiser and The Australian are also available. =Schools= Munno Para Primary School is located near the centre of the original part of the suburb. Mark Oliphant College and Adelaide North Special School are in the northern part of the newer area. Attractions =Parks= There is greenspace throughout the residential areas of the suburb. The older part is designed with a linear park through the middle of the long axis. The newer part has landscaped wetlands along Curtis Road near Douglas Drive (formerly Coventry Road) and near Stebonheath Road. These wetlands calm and treat stormwater before releasing it into Smith Creek. The North Lakes golf course is in the northwestern corner.

The pieces are represented as follows: rooks are used for the boats, kings for the kings, pawns for the queens (aka officials) bishops for the border posts (aka elephants), and Go stones for the fish. Ouk-Khmer (also known as Cambodian Chess) is a chess variant which D. B. Pritchard claimed was played in Cambodia although its actual origins appear to be unknown.The Cambodian Chess Riddle Pritchard gives the source as P. A. Hill. It combines elements of makruk and xiangqi. Similar to xiangqi, it is played on the intersections of an 8×8 monotone board (instead of 8×9). Contrary to Pritchard's claim, the actual variety of chess played in Cambodia today, known as \\"Ok\\"Khmer Institute (If the link redirects to the main page of the Khmer Institute, click on the \\"culture\\" link, then the \\"Ok Cambodian chess\\" link) or \\"Ouk Chatrang\\", is nearly identical to makruk. The authenticity of the game described by Pritchard remains doubtful. Pieces Jean-Louis Cazaux described the movement of the pieces as follows: ;Boat :Analogous to the rook in Western chess, the boat slides any number of spaces in the orthogonal directions (i.e. left, right, up, down). ;King :As in Western chess, the king steps one space in any direction. ;Horse :As with the knight in Western chess, the horse leaps one orthogonal and then one diagonal in any direction. ;Elephant :The elephant moves as a king but cannot capture in the three backward directions. ;Official :Like the queen in shatranj, the official steps one space diagonally but can only capture in the two forward directions. ;Fish :Analogous to the pawn in Western chess, the fish steps one space orthogonally forwards until crossing the center line of the board, at which point it promotes and may move as a king. According to a description originating with John Gollon: \\"the Fishes are irregular disks marked differently on either side so pieces which have crossed the center line and have been flipped can be distinguished.\\" The story of Hill's \\"Cambodian chess\\" Pritchard (The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, 1994) described this game as \\"an old variant displaying elements of Burmese Chess, Chaturanga and Makruk\\". However, the rules provided appear to be a hybrid of Makruk and Xiangqi. For example, play on the intersections and the movement of the fish (pawn) follow Xiangqi rules. The advanced placement of the full line of pawns resembles the initial setup of makruk. The naming of the \\"boat\\" also follows makruk. John Gollon, the author of \\"Chess Variations: Ancient, Regional, and Modern\\", received a description of a chess game in 1969 from a U.S. serviceman who claimed to have obtained the details from a Cambodian born guerrilla officer he was questioning. The serviceman expressed concern that he may have been mistaken about some of the details and Gollon stated that he was never able to confirm the details with an official Cambodian source. He admitted in his letter: “The correspondent later expressed some concern that he may have been mistaken in some details.” In 2007, the English chess specialist John Beasley published a revised edition of late D.B.Pritchard's book (The Classified Encyclopedia of Chess Variants), in which more details from Gollon's letter were given (such as the local names of the chessmen, not included in the 1st edition) and where Beasley expressed his strong doubt about the authenticity of this kind of chess. In reaction to this publication, Beasley was sent information that a set of this chess had made an apparition in an exhibition in Tokyo in 2002 as well as in several Japanese books that preceded or followed, written by Umebayashi Isao and Okano Shin. They could have rediscovered these rules by translating a book bought in Cambodia, where the Elephant could not capture sideways. The names they gave for the chessmen were somewhat different from Gollon (Kwon, Neamahn, Kwo, Seh, Tuuk, Trey as for the table). Umebayashi and Okano designated that game as \\"shattrong\\". A photo of a complete set was available showing the 18 pieces on a board with marked diagonals. Beasley published a corrective note in the British specialized magazine Variant Chess (Issue 55, September 2007 and issue 64, August 2010 Cambodian Chess, Chess Variants Magazine ) to acknowledge this second “evidence”. He acknowledged that the game is apparently absent \\"from the streets of Phnom Penh in 2003\\" and stated that Peter suggested \\"that this may have been a minor consequence of the mass killings of the Pol Pot era.\\". The situation has been cleared out in 2012 with the help of a Japanese chess researcher, Yasuji Shimuzu who got in touch with Umebayashi Isao. First, it has been now understood that Umebayashi and Okano's books were simply presenting a reconstruction of the “Cambodian” chess which they had discovered in Pritchard's first edition. As Pritchard didn't name the chessmen in his first edition, the Japanese authors extrapolated the names with the help of a dictionary. No Cambodian books had been consulted and even found. The difference in Elephant's move was simply a misreading. Finally, looking for an illustration, they just set up a set of makruk with additional Fishes and Officials over a facsimile Burmese board that they had and fitted well the size of his chessmen. John Beasley published a corrective note on his website http://www.jsbeasley.co.uk/. His conclusion is that the game described to P. A. Hill in 1969 appeared once more to reduce to a single informant whose statements were at variance with all other known testimony. Moreover, John Beasley has found and proven that the game is flawed if played seriously.

Repurposed after Greek independence in 1834, it fell into disrepair, but after renovations it was reopened to the public in 2017 and is presently being used for cultural exhibitions.  History  The Fethiye Mosque is located on the northern side of the ancient Roman Agora in Athens, near the Tower of the Winds, and was built on the ruins of a Christian basilica from the middle Byzantine period (8th/9th centuries). The Christian church was converted into a mosque in 1456/58, soon after the Ottoman conquest of the Duchy of Athens, to coincide with the visit to the city by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror in 1458.Ottoman mosques cast historic light in Greek capital Only a fragment of the mihrab survives from this mosque, which was demolished and replaced by the present structure between 1668 and 1670. The new mosque comprises a porch and a large rectangular main hall, crowned by a dome supported by four pillars. The central dome is flanked by half-domes on each side, and by smaller domes on each corner. The porch is supported by five arches, each crowned by a small dome, resting on masonry on the sides and four pillars in the middle. During Ottoman times, it was commonly known as the \\"Wheatmarket Mosque\\" (Τζαμί του Σταροπάζαρου). During the brief occupation of the city by the Venetian forces in the Morean War (October 1687 – May 1688), the mosque was converted by the Venetians into a Catholic church, dedicated to Dionysius the Areopagite. Following the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, in 1824 the disused mosque was used as a school by the Filomousos Eteria of Athens. At about the same time, or shortly after the end of the war, the mosque's minaret was torn down. From 1834, after Greek independence, and until the early 20th century, it was used successively as a barracks, a military prison and finally as a military bakery, at which point additions were made to the building to house the bakery's kilns. From the early 20th century it is used mostly as a storage place for various finds from the excavations in the Agora and the Acropolis of Athens. Except for the removal of recent additions and the restoration to its original shape in 1935, the mosque has never undergone a complete restoration, and by 2010 had developed serious structural problems. In autumn 2010, the Greek Ministry of Culture ordered the emptying of the building from the various antiquities stored there, and the beginning of the process to restore it and open it to the public. The decision was sanctioned by Greece's Central Archaeological Council in 2013, paving the way for its restoration and its opening to the public as a space for cultural events. Following extensive restoration and renovation, the mosque was reopened to the public in 2017, and cultural exhibitions are held there.

Biography =Early life= The future Royal Noble Consort Suk was born on the sixth day of the eleventh lunar month in the eleventh year of the reign of Hyeonjong of Joseon, which translates to December 17, 1670 in the Gregorian calendar. Her personal name is unknown. She was the younger daughter of Choi Hyo-won (Korean: 최효원; Hanja: 崔孝元; 1638–1672) and Lady Hong of the Namyang clan (Korean: 남양홍씨; Hanja: 南陽洪氏; 1639–1673).After his death, Yeongjo upgraded him in status and bestowed on him the title of prime minister, an attempt of Yeongjo to upgrade his maternal family's status. She had one older brother, Choi Dong-hu (), who married Lady An of the Sunheung clan, and one older sister who married Seo Jeon (). =Palace maid= She entered the palace at the age of 7. Choi Suk-bin belonged to the \\"cheonmin\\" class which was the lowest class during the Joseon Dynasty. How she and the King had their first encounter is unknown. The most accepted version is that she was a \\"musuri\\" (a water maid in the palace) during the time when Queen Inhyeon was exiled and Jang Hui-bin had acquired the status of Queen. One night, Lady Choi was praying for Queen Inhyeon's well being when King Sukjong, who was returning to the palace from a trip, overheard her and was moved by her words. The book 수문록 authored by Yi Mun-jeong (1656–1726) describes the events that led to the execution of Jang Hui-bin. The author who lived during Sukjong's time, recorded the encounter as follows: :\\"One night, the King [Sukjong] couldn't sleep, and suffering from insomnia decided to go out. When returning to the palace and passing by the servants' chambers, he suddenly heard sobbing coming from a small room. Out of curiosity, he took a peep into the room, then to his surprise in this neat and tidy room, he saw there was a setup of an offering for a banquet. He then saw a young palace musuri dressed in her official uniform, weeping bitterly in front of the table set for a memorial ritual. The memorial tablet was set for the former Queen Inhyeon. The King was surprised, since Queen Inhyeon had been deposed. The musuri had placed the memorial tablet because the deposed Queen Inhyeon had sacrificed herself for the King's sake. But fearing Queen Jang Hui Bin's influence, no one dared to commemorate the deposed Queen Inhyeon, as no one wanted to be accused and executed. The King was surprised that even under these perilous circumstances someone dared to risk death to honor and pray for Queen Inhyeon's well being, and he spoke to her. The musuri (later to become Choi Suk-bin) heard his voice, and turning around, was stunned to see the King. Recognizing him, she knelt before him and he asked her for an explanation. The musuri answered with a trembling voice, \\"Your Majesty, I used to serve under Queen Inhyeon when she was Queen. Today is her birthday, I cannot forget the kindness that Queen Inhyeon rendered to me when I served under her, thus privately I set a memorial for her. Please punish me with death.\\" Hearing such an extreme plea, the King was taken aback and was astonished. Others in her situation would have played safe and not put themselves at risk, but this musuri risked death to honor her former Queen. Commendable and virtuous indeed was she and the King, finding himself witnessing this, was moved. He then brought the young musuri to his bed chambers. His feelings turned from sympathy into fondness and then into love, and he spent many nights with her. Over time, this musuri came to be known as Choi Suk-bin\\". =Royal consort= In 1693, she became Sukjong's concubine with the 4th junior rank of Suk-won, after giving birth to a prince who died young. One year later, she was elevated to the 2nd junior rank of Suk-ui, after giving birth to another son, Prince Yeoning. In 1695, she was again elevated to the 1st junior rank of Gwi-in. In 1698, she gave birth to a stillborn prince. In 1699, she was again promoted to the 1st senior rank of Bin, with the adjective Suk, meaning (淑) \\"pure\\" and became a Royal Noble Consort. Lady Choi openly supported Queen Inhyeon and was against Jang Hui- bin, who history had described as an evil and cruel woman. By 1693, the King was growing disillusioned with Jang Hui-bin and the Soron faction. In 1694, King Sukjong brought back Queen Inhyeon and demoted Lady Jang (Queen Bu-ok) back to Royal Noble Consort Hui. In 1701, Queen Inhyeon died of an unknown cause. Some historiographers believe she was poisoned, but this is unconfirmed. According to one version, Sukjong found Jang Hui-bin in her room with a shaman, making merry over having caused the Queen's death through black magic.https://archive.org/stream/historyofkorea02hulbuoft#page/160/mode/2up Another interpretation based on a vague passage of the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty states that it was Choi Suk-bin who told the King that sorcery had been used to try to bring harm to the Queen. Under the title, Queen's Will, it is written: :Oegan (外间) Quote--\\"Choi Suk-bin with her usual grace gives tribute to the Queen (Inhyeon) (追慕), and weeping (痛哭) for the one that could not win the heart of the King, she informed the King of the secret.\\" However, the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty recorded in 1701, state that Min Chin-won and Min Chin-hu informed King Sukjong of Jang Hui-bin's sorcery, claiming that in doing so they were in compliance with Queen Inhyeon's last request to them before dying. According to Min Chin-won, the rumor in the palace was that Jang Hui-bin had been using a shaman to curse the Queen and she came to know about these rumors. Regardless of how the King came to know about this, he decided to look into the matter and discovered the truth behind the rumors that Jang Hui-bin had built a shamanist altar within her quarters, where effigies with the name of the Queen were found. Later, her ladies-in-waiting declared that she had ordered them to shoot arrows at a portrait of Queen Inhyeon three times at day, and had buried dead animals in her palace's garden.Women in Korean History 한국 역사 속의 여성들 pag.111 Despite the many pleas of the Soron faction to pardon her, King Sukjong felt her conduct was so wicked, and in 1701 ordered that Lady Jang and all the others involved should die by poison. After sentencing her, King Sukjong passed a law forbidding a concubine with the rank of Bin to become Queen.http://www.exploringkorea.com/daebinmyo-tomb- at-seooreung-tombs/ A misunderstanding exists that Choi Suk-bin was the next in line to become Queen, but this had no basis. The next to become Queen was Royal Noble Consort Yeong of the Andong Kim clan (영빈 김씨). In addition, another concubine, Royal Noble Consort Myeong of the Miryang Park clan (명빈 박씨), daughter of the Yangban class, gave birth to a prince in 1699 and was probably more suited for the title of Queen after Lady Kim Yeong-bin. Choi Suk-bin's lower class status was an impediment to her becoming Queen as the Confucian society was ruled by a class system. We can clearly see this in the life of King Yeongjo (son of Choi Suk-bin) who was threatened in the beginning of his rule partially because of his mother's class. Later, when his rulership was firmly established, he considered it a personal insult if his mother's background as a slave was mentioned.The Confucian Kingship in Korea: Yŏngjo and the Politics of Sagacity By JaHyun Kim Haboush, pages 57-58. =Controversy of rank= Her only surviving son was Prince Yeoning (Yi Geum, later King Yeongjo), who was known to be a child prodigy and became one of the greatest kings in Joseon.https://archive.org/stream/historyofkorea02hulbuoft#page/164/mode/2up King Sukjong was very proud and his treatment of him tended towards the lavish. But because the Prince had been the son of a low-born concubine, the officials who were born in noble houses and had noble wives maintained a condescending view of him and his mother, and were quick to lecture Sukjong on frugality and modesty. However, the King ignored them.\\"The Confucian Kingship in Korea: Yŏngjo and the Politics of Sagacity\\", page 57 In 1704, the King celebrated the wedding of Prince Yeoning with a grand and lavish party, but again, the ministries complained about the excessive favoritism the King showed to the Prince. Later the same year, Sukjong gave his winter house, Ihyeon Palace (where he had spent the days of his youth), as a gift to Choi Suk-bin. Although Yeongjo in his adulthood was very sensible about the origins of his mother, one cannot deny the deep love he had for his birth mother, Lady Choi. His reverence for his mother had no limit. He wrote her many poems and said in one of them: :\\"My father begot me, my mother fed me, led me, bred me, brought me up, reared me, kept her eye on me, tended me, at every turn aided me. Their goods deeds I would requite\\".\\"Confucian Kingship in Korea: Yŏngjo and the Politics of Sagacity\\", page 280 Yeongjo fought the court to have Choi Suk-bin recognized as a public mother, because she was like other concubines—mothers of Kings, but regarded as a \\"private mother of the King\\". But Yeongjo wanted to change that and have her as his \\"public mother\\". However, the officials were opposed to it as this meant the ministers would have to honor her and gave the King the right to visit her tomb often as a part of his royal ceremonies. During the time he was fighting this, there are two interesting accounts of his feelings about this situation. In 1739, the day before the scheduled visit to Choi Suk-bin's tomb, dissatisfied with the protocols that the Board of Rites had drawn up, he censured two officials who were directly responsible for them. The Sillok explains the measure: :\\"The King respectfully served his private parent [Choi Suk-bin], but he suspected that the officials were unwilling to comply with his desire. Thus, on each occasion sudden clashes erupted, inevitably followed by a distressing royal declamation.\\" On another occasion, the King was leaving her tomb for the Palace. About to mount the palanquin, he instead summoned the Minister of Military Affairs, Kim Son-gung. Breaking into sobs, he said: : \\"Since 1737, this was the first time I came to pay respect to my mother. For those years, my heart has been filled with sadness. When children fall down, they automatically call out for their mother. This is human nature. At the time of divination, if there is no person offering earth, how can there be a divination? I have sent down orders [to make his birth mother a public or legal mother], but the bureaus in charge have ignored them. True, the ruler is not allowed to have private concerns, but it is wrong to lose trust [in his officials]. The elite scholars of today are just too cold-hearted. Those elite scholar must also have parents. They could not have fallen from Heaven or sprung from earth.\\"\\"The Confucian Kingship in Korea: Yŏngjo and the Politics of Sagacity\\" By JaHyun Kim Haboush, page 55. In the end, he got what he wanted and Lady Choi was recognized as his public mother. =Timeline= Between 1699-1702, Royal Noble Consort Suk was the principal benefactor of the Gakhwangjeon Hall in Hwaeomsa temple. In 1703, Queen Inwon adopted Prince Yeoning, who was known to be her favorite and whom she regarded as her own son.The Confucian Kingship in Korea: Yŏngjo and the Politics of Sagacity page, 53. In 1704, the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty stated that for Yeoning's marriage, the King ordered a very expensive wedding. The nobles complained about the big cost, since he was not even the Crown Prince, but the son of a concubine.Annals of Joseon, Sukjong 26 February 21. In 1704, the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty state that Sukjong bestowed to Choi Suk-bin the Ihyeon Palace, which she later conferred to his son to consummate his marriage in 1711.Annals of Joseon Sukjong,30 http://sillok.history.go.kr/inspection/inspection.jsp?mTree=0&id;=ksa It is said it was a large and spacious building located in Seoul. In 1711, when Queen Inwon came down with smallpox, Lady Choi ordered the gungnyeo to go out of the palace and look for remedies among the commoners to save the Queen, who in the end survived. In 1716, Choi Suk-bin was taken out of the palace while ill. Later that same year, Sukjong received a message from Yeoning informing him that his mother's health had worsened and asking for more medical help.Annal of Joseon, Sukjong 42 In 1717, Sukjong retired from politics and allowed his son, the Crown Prince, to take over most of the affairs of the government.The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong, page 22. =Death= In 1718, the Royal Noble Consort Suk died at the age of 49, in Ihyeon Palace.It was customary for Concubines to die out of the Changdeokgung Palace. Some queens voluntarily decided to leave Changdeokgung Palace and died in their own private Palace.The Confucian Kingship in Korea: Yŏngjo and the Politics of Sagacity page 58 That same year, Sukjong declared the Crown Prince Gyeongjong as regent, who ruled in his stead. In her memorial tablet (which is in Soryeongwon, her royal tomb),http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/search_plaza_new/ECulresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=13%2C03580000%2C31 under the description of her character it is written: :\\"Her disposition and her status was absolutely indivisible. She did not scruple on people. She was respectful and always waited on Queen Inhyeon and later on Queen Inwon. Her wisdom and intelligence shined on her interaction with others. She kept to her duty and protocol. She never entered in palace disputes. She spent her days in peace and harmony.\\" She is buried in Soryeongwon (昭寧園) in Paju, designated as historical site no. 358 (address: 267 Yeongjang-ri, Gwangtan-myeon, Paju, Gyeonggi Province). Sukjong died in 1720, supposedly after telling Yi Yi- myoung to name Prince Yeoning as Gyeongjong's heir. When her son became King, Yeongjo set up a Jesil to grieve over her death near her grave as a display of his deep filial piety. in addition to building tablet houses on the four spots around her grave, he also erected gravestones, the contents of which were written by him in her memory. Her memorial tablet was enshrined in the Sukbinmyo, later called Yuksangmyo and Chilgung (historical site no. 149), the place which houses the ancestral tablets of seven royal concubines, all of whom were birth mothers of Kings that never achieved the status of a Queen. Choi Suk-bin was given the posthumous title \\"Lady Hwagyeong, Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Choi clan\\" (). She was raised to the posthumous titles of Hwagyong (\\"harmonious reverence\\") in 1753, and was again elevated to Hwideok (\\"magnificent virtue\\") and Ansun (\\"tranquil purity\\").

The aim of this article is to define the notion in terms of abstract algebraic geometry and to describe some basic uses of projective space.  Homogeneous polynomial ideals Let k be an algebraically closed field, and V be a finite-dimensional vector space over k. The symmetric algebra of the dual vector space V* is called the polynomial ring on V and denoted by k[V]. It is a naturally graded algebra by the degree of polynomials. The projective Nullstellensatz states that, for any homogeneous ideal I that does not contain all polynomials of a certain degree (referred to as an irrelevant ideal), the common zero locus of all polynomials in I (or Nullstelle) is non-trivial (i.e. the common zero locus contains more than the single element {0}), and, more precisely, the ideal of polynomials that vanish on that locus coincides with the radical of the ideal I. This last assertion is best summarized by the formula : for any relevant ideal I, : mathcal I (mathcal V(I)) = sqrt I . In particular, maximal homogeneous relevant ideals of k[V] are one-to-one with lines through the origin of V.  Construction of projectivized schemes Let V be a finite- dimensional vector space over a field k. The scheme over k defined by Proj(k[V]) is called projectivization of V. The projective n-space on k is the projectivization of the vector space mathbb A_k^{n+1}. The definition of the sheaf is done on the base of open sets of principal open sets D(P), where P varies over the set of homogeneous polynomials, by setting the sections :Gamma (D(P), mathcal O_{mathbb P (V)}) to be the ring (k[V]_P)_0, the zero degree component of the ring obtained by localization at P. Its elements are therefore the rational functions with homogeneous numerator and some power of P as the denominator, with same degree as the numerator. The situation is most clear at a non-vanishing linear form φ. The restriction of the structure sheaf to the open set D(φ) is then canonically identified In coordinates this correspondence is given by frac{P (X_0, ldots, X_n)} {X_0^{deg(P)}} mapsto P(1,X_1,ldots, X_n) with the affine scheme spec(k[ker φ]). Since the D(φ) form an open cover of X the projective schemes can be thought of as being obtained by the gluing via projectivization of isomorphic affine schemes. It can be noted that the ring of global sections of this scheme is a field, which implies that the scheme is not affine. Any two open sets intersect non- trivially: ie the scheme is irreducible. When the field k is algebraically closed, mathbb P(V) is in fact an abstract variety, that furthermore is complete. cf. Glossary of scheme theory  Divisors and twisting sheaves  The Proj functor in fact gives more than a mere scheme: a sheaf in graded modules over the structure sheaf is defined in the process. The homogeneous components of this graded sheaf are denoted mathcal O (i), the Serre twisting sheaves. All of these sheaves are in fact line bundles. By the correspondence between Cartier divisors and line bundles, the first twisting sheaf mathcal O(1) is equivalent to hyperplane divisors. Since the ring of polynomials is a unique factorization domain, any prime ideal of height 1 is principal, which shows that any Weil divisor is linearly equivalent to some power of a hyperplane divisor. This consideration proves that the Picard group of a projective space is free of rank 1. That is mathrm{Pic} mathbf P^n_mathbf k = mathbb Z, and the isomorphism is given by the degree of divisors. =Classification of vector bundles= The invertible sheaves, or line bundles, on the projective space mathbb{P}^n_k,, for k a field, are exactly the twisting sheaves mathcal{O}(m), m in mathbb{Z}, so the Picard group of mathbb{P}^n_k is isomorphic to mathbb{Z}. The isomorphism is given by the first Chern class. The space of local sections on an open set U subseteq mathbb P (V) of the line bundle mathcal O(k) is the space of homogeneous degree k regular functions on the cone in V associated to U. In particular, the space of global sections : Gamma (mathbb P, mathcal O (m)) vanishes if m < 0, and consists of constants in k for m=0 and of homogeneous polynomials of degree m for m > 0. (Hence has dimension binom{m + n}{m} = binom{m + n}{n}). The Birkhoff-Grothendieck theorem states that on the projective line, any vector bundle splits in a unique way as a direct sum of the line bundles. =Important line bundles = The tautological bundle, which appears for instance as the exceptional divisor of the blowing up of a smooth point is the sheaf mathcal O (-1). The canonical bundle :mathcal K(mathbb{P}^n_k),, is mathcal O(-(n+1)). This fact derives from a fundamental geometric statement on projective spaces: the Euler sequence. The negativity of the canonical line bundle makes projective spaces prime examples of Fano varieties, equivalently, their anticanonical line bundle is ample (in fact very ample). Their index (cf. Fano varieties) is given by mathrm {Ind} (mathbb P^n) = n+1, and, by a theorem of Kobayashi-Ochiai, projective spaces are characterized amongst Fano varieties by the property :mathrm {Ind} (X) = mathrm{dim} X +1.  Morphisms to projective schemes  As affine spaces can be embedded in projective spaces, all affine varieties can be embedded in projective spaces too. Any choice of a finite system of nonsimultaneously vanishing global sections of a globally generated line bundle defines a morphism to a projective space. A line bundle whose base can be embedded in a projective space by such a morphism is called very ample. The group of symmetries of the projective space mathbb P^n_{mathbf k} is the group of projectivized linear automorphisms mathrm {PGL}_{n+1}(mathbf k). The choice of a morphism to a projective space j : X to mathbf P^n modulo the action of this group is in fact equivalent to the choice of a globally generating n-dimensional linear system of divisors on a line bundle on X. The choice of a projective embedding of X, modulo projective transformations is likewise equivalent to the choice of a very ample line bundle on X. A morphism to a projective space j : X to mathbf P^n defines a globally generated line bundle by j^* mathcal O (1) and a linear system :j^* (Gamma (mathbf P^n, mathcal O(1))) subset Gamma (X, j^*mathcal O(1) ). If the range of the morphism j is not contained in a hyperplane divisor, then the pull-back is an injection and the linear system of divisors :j^* (Gamma (mathbf P^n, mathcal O(1))) is a linear system of dimension n. =An example: the Veronese embeddings= The Veronese embeddings are embeddings mathbb P^n to mathbb P^N for N=binom{n+d}{d} -1 See the answer on MathOverflow for an application of the Veronese embedding to the calculation of cohomology groups of smooth projective hypersurfaces (smooth divisors). Curves in projective spaces As Fano varieties, the projective spaces are ruled varieties. The intersection theory of curves in the projective plane yields the Bézout theorem.

Shazar Shafat, a security analyst, suggests two reasons in South Asian Voices (hosted by The Stimson Center) as to why Asad Durrani may be facing the backlash. The first is related to Durrani's comments on Akhand Bharat in the book and the second is in relation to comments on Kulbhushan Jadhav. However, a report by CNN found that the book (as well as a pirated PDF version) was freely available in Pakistan and that the Pakistani governments \\"overreaction\\", according to Hassan Askari Rizvi and other defence analysts, may be because Durrani did not get prior permissions for such a book. On 22 February 2019, Asad Durrani was found guilty of violating Pakistan's Military Code of Conduct for co-writing the book. Asad Durrani's pension and other allowances have been withdrawn and it is yet to be decided if he should be taken off the Exit Control List or not.

It is named after the adjacent stadium, Providence Park. The station primarily serves Providence Park and residential areas around West Burnside Street. The station, consisting of separate eastbound and westbound platforms built into city sidewalks between SW 17th and SW 18th Avenues on SW Yamhill and SW Morrison Streets, opened on August 31, 1997. Originally named Civic Stadium, it was renamed to PGE Park in 2001, Jeld-Wen Field in 2011, and to its present name in 2014. All of the renamings were the results of changes in the name of the stadium. Station details Tracks split just outside the station on SW 18th Ave. into eastbound tracks on SW Yamhill St. and westbound tracks on SW Morrison St. This split results in a transit mall east to SW 1st Ave. The Morrison platform is at an angle to the street grid and has a regular side platform which fronts a small public plaza. There is also a second platform and storage track used for special events. The Yamhill Street platform takes the entire block from 17th to 18th. A large apartment complex occupies the space between the platforms. =Public art= Oregonian printing plant is at left. The station's southern platform (used by eastbound trains), on Yamhill Street, was located directly adjacent to the longtime printing plant of the city's major newspaper, The Oregonian, until the plant's closure in 2015 and demolition in 2018. As a reflection of this, TriMet chose \\"communication\\" as the theme for the public art at this station – known as Civic Stadium station at the time of its opening, in 1997 – \\"celebrating the importance of communication to the vitality of our city\\". The Yamhill platform features unique seating shaped like punctuation marks. The nearby westbound platform features small bronze pedestals in the shapes of a \\"stump, capital and soapbox, suggest[ing] podiums for impromptu oratories\\". A utility building is adorned with stainless-steel panels etched with poems by writer Robert Sullivan on the history of the region and \\"great moments in Oregon free-speech history\\", Oregonian architecture critic Randy Gragg wrote in a 1998 review. Bus line connections This station is served by the following bus lines: *15-Belmont/NW 23rd *18-Hillside *51-Vista *63-Washington Park The line 20-Burnside/Stark also stops two blocks north of the station on West Burnside Street at NW 19th Avenue (westbound) and NW 18th Avenue (eastbound).

It was first described in veterinary literature in the 1980s. Signs There are two expressions of this condition, one for long or double coated breeds and one for short coated breeds, both with differing presentations. * For long- or double-coated breeds such as Poodles, Akitas and Samoyeds, the condition often presents itself with silvery dandruff which adheres to the coat, hair loss (not to be confused with moulting or \\"blowing coat\\"), a dull and brittle coat, and later on skin lesions along the back and ears as well as thickened skin and a musty or rancid odour. * For short-coated breeds such as Vizslas, the condition causes facial swellings, nodular skin lesions, fine dandruff which does not adhere to the coat, and a general \\"moth-eaten\\" appearance to the coat. Cause Anatomy of human skin, which shows the location of human and canine sebaceous glands The signs of sebaceous adenitis are caused by an inflammatory disease process which affects the sebaceous glands of the skin. The cause of the inflammatory disease is unknown. Different breeds of dogs may have different underlying causes of the disease. Research is currently underway to find if there is a genetic predisposition for sebaceous adenitis; the exact mode of inheritance remains unknown. In Standard Poodles, sebaceous adenitis is most likely an autosomal recessive inherited disease, with variable expression. Diagnosis In general, sebaceous adenitis is underdiagnosed in dogs. Diagnosis confirmation requires multiple punch biopsies analysed by a dermopathologist who will comment on the condition of the sebaceous glands, revealing granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation surrounding the sebaceous glands or even complete destruction of sebaceous glands. Other conditions with similar presentations include: bacterial folliculitis and demodicosis, dermatophytosis, endocrinopathy, pemphigus foliaceus, zinc responsive dermatosis, vitamin A-responsive dermatosis, ichthyosis, and nutritional deficiencies. As well as, superficial pyoderma, primary idiopathic seborrhea and other endocrine diseases. Treatment There is no cure for this condition. Treatment is generally lifelong and takes the form of bathing and soaking in mineral oils and washing with antibiotic shampoos to try to alleviate symptoms and slow the condition's progression. Antiseptic and antibiotic shampoos (chlorhexidine or benzoyl peroxide) are used to manage further secondary bacterial infection. For some breeds, cyclosporine or corticosteroids and immunosuppressant drugs may be effective, and it is postulated, through some studies, that large doses of vitamin A given orally may result in some improvement. It has been suggested that the more aggressively one applies the topical methods of treatment, the less aggressively one needs to employ the immunosuppressant therapy. The suggestion is that this phenomenon may be due to a cyclic feedback whereby secondary infection, when not aggressively treated with topical therapy, increases and contributes to further sebaceous gland inflammation. = Topical therapy = This forms a major and critical part in the disease treatment and the shampoo treatment can need to be applied as often as 3 to 4 times per week. An antiseborrheic shampoo removes the scale blocking the follicles. The mineral oil soak, whereby the oil remains on the affected animal for at least 2 hours, is needed to replace epidermal lipids as well as to restore normal epidermal barrier function. The oil is then removed through the process of many baths. This oil treatment needs to be repeated at least once a week for 4 to 7 weeks until new hair growth is observed. Once new hair growth is observed, topical treatment can be decreased to every 2 to 4 weeks. = Immunosuppressant therapy = Immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory therapy serves to stop on- going destruction of the sebaceous glands. Like other inflammatory diseases, most animals receive an initial course to stop the inflammation and treatment is tapered off to the lowest dose that keeps the disease in remission. Oral cyclosporine may be used. Corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) are used only if pruritus is a major clinical feature. = Dietary supplementation = Commonly used dietary supplements include: * Omega-6 fatty acids (e.g., safflower or sunflower oil) * Omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., fish oils) * Vitamin A. Epidemiology While the condition has been seen in over 60 breeds of dog (including cross breeds), certain breeds have been found to be more susceptible than others to sebaceous adenitis: * American Akita and Akita Inu * Standard Poodle * Vizsla *English Springer Spaniel * Chow Chow * Samoyed * Weimaraner * Havanese Breeds also mentioned in scientific literature as having some susceptibility include: * German Shepherd * Dachshund * Old English Sheepdog * Lhasa Apso * Boxer * Collie * Toy Poodle * Mixed-breeds Sebaceous adenitis has no sex-predisposition. Sebaceous adenitis also occurs in cats, rabbits, and horses. Etymology Sebaceous refers to the gland which is affected by the disease. Adenitis is a general term referring to the inflammation of a gland.

In the first round of the season, against Fitzroy, Gill had kicked a career best three goals before he tore a knee cartilage and was taken off the ground. Although he returned to the team four rounds later, Gill re-injured his leg and had to retire.

The troupe toured Australia with a total of 25 original shows between 1974 and 1983. The key players in the ensemble organised ten large community events and were behind many community arts projects.Challenging the Centre: Two Decades of Political Theatre. Edited by Steve Capelin. Brisbane: Playlab Press, 1995 Beginnings The Popular Theatre Troupe had its genesis in the meetings Richard Fotheringham called during 1973 to discuss options for the planned 'fringe theatre' for Queensland's first 'Festival of the Arts' directed by Lesley Gotto. Inspirations and influences included Oh! What a Lovely War and The Legend of King O'Malley. A leader of alternative theatre in Britain, Albert Hunt, was brought out by the University of Queensland's English Department to mentor the group. Their first production was Star Trick, a satire lampooning the Star Trek television series focussing on the absurdity of local Queensland politics interspersed with ironically sung old popular songs. Geoffrey Milne in Theatre Australia (un)limited: Australian theatre since the 1950s suggests precursors to the Popular Theatre Troupe's type of political theatre included Peter Oysten at Victoria College of the Arts, the San Francisco Mime Troupe and run-of-the-mill communist theatre featured at worker's clubs.Milne, Geoffrey, Theatre Australia (un)limited: Australian theatre since the 1950s, Rodopi, 2004 The White Man's Mission (1975) by Richard Fotheringham and Albert Hunt stands out as one of the troupe's strongest scripts. It is reproduced in full in one of the few published texts on Brisbane's political theatre, \\"Challenging the centre\\" (1995) edited by Steve Capelin, where it takes up 36 pages about Australian racism, slavery and exploitation.Riley, Dave 1996, The politics of performance, Green Left Weekly http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/13497y  It was invited to the Adelaide Festival in 1976. Cultural Context Although funded by the Community Arts and Theatre Boards of the Australia Council, the Popular Theatre Troupe received no financial assistance from the Queensland Government. Quite the contrary, as a radical extra-parliamentary opposition, the Popular Theatre Troupe's activities were monitored closely by the Special Branch of the Queensland Police and two of their shows were banned. The Popular Theatre Troupe were followed by another group, Order By Numbers, which was in some ways an unfunded Popular Theatre Troupe reprise in 1985–86, featuring writers Hugh Watson, Dee Martin, Penny Glass, Kery O'Rourke, Nat Trimarchi and Gavan Fenelon. Order By Numbers and a sister company Teatro Unidad y Liberacion, were administered by an incorporated group called The New Actor's Company. The material for the satires performed were Brisbane cultural and political events, such as the SEQEB Strike in 1985. A few short wicks in paradise by the ensemble took the side of the striking workers in opposing anti-union laws of the Bjelke-Petersen government. The founding members of Order By Numbers were Dee Martin, Penny Glass, Gavan Fenelon and Nat Trimarchi. Hugh Watson and Kerry O'Rourke were involved as writers. Overlapping this period was the genesis of Street Arts a community-arts driven theatre company which, unlike Popular Theatre Troupe which was more classically agit-prop in performing for the audience, were interested in creating theatre by enabling the communities suffering disadvantage, through, circus, song, drama and cabaret. Many of the players, thinkers, writers and artists involved in the and were to find homes in Street Arts. Key Players Key members of the group included writers and directors Errol O'Neill, John Watson, Fiona Winning, Alexandra Black, Kerry O'Rourke, Dee Martin, Bernie Lewis, Hugh Watson, Stephen Stockwell, Richard Fotheringham, Robert Perrier, Doug Anderson and Albert Hunt. Performers included Kathryn Porrill, Therese Collie, Ken MacLeod, Julie Hickson, Michael Cummings, Lynne Samson, Teresa Wilkinson, John Lane, Duncan Campbell, Lindy Morrison, Errol O'Neill, Leah Cotterell, Katrina Deverey, Nat Trimarchi, Gavin Fenelon and Penny Glass. England Six members of the group staged an English tour of The White Man's Mission in 1977, assisted by a cash grant from the Arts Council of Great Britain, a minibus from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, and in kind resources from the Bradford College Five of those members were, Duncan Campbell, Nick Hughes, Kath Porrill, Janet Mahoney and Micko O'Byrne. The tour received favourable reviews and ran for three weeks in London before doing a regional tour of England. Final years Australia Council funding was withdrawn in 1982 and though some members of the company struggled on, it eventually folded in 1983.

In a flashback Hook receives a message about a Japanese air raid. He quickly informs his superiors. Several American planes take off in the sky and leave the ship unprotected. Then a Japanese kamikaze pilot, who was hiding in a cloud, attacks the ship. Hook runs away, but finds a huge collection of war bonds which he literally uses as ammunition for his plane. After a few chase scenes Hook defeats the Japanese soldier by throwing the warbonds at the Japanese pilot who crashes down on an island, leaving only his clattering teeth behind. Back in 1953 Hook tells his son that thanks to the war bonds we won the war and it paid for their home, their new furniture and their new plane. He tells his son: \\"As a matter of fact if it weren't for the war bonds you wouldn't be here.\\" The son remarks: \\"That ain't the way I heard it.\\" Thereupon the cartoon ends with a close-up of Hook's startled face.

His work is represented in major public collections, such as the Guggenheim New York, Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, Centre Pompidou, Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, and Sharjah Art Foundation. Early work Sharif’s early ‘caricatures’ were printed in the UAE’s nascent newspapers and magazines from 1973 to 1979, and reflected on the political climate of the Middle East in the 1970s as well as the UAE’s rapid urbanisation and commercial globalisation since its formation. By the time Sharif left the UAE in 1979 to pursue a formal art education, he had actively rejected calligraphic abstraction and Arab Nationalism, both of which were the dominant discourse in the region at that time, as well as the ‘negative irony’ of his early cartoons. \\"I had had some experience from creating the Caricatures but when I went to Britain I wanted to clean that away; to forget or ignore what I had been doing before. [...] I just wanted to be around new ideas and whatever new was happening.\\" Career Hassan Sharif during his exhibition, 1976 After a foundation year studying in Leamington Spa, Sharif enrolled at the Byam Shaw School of Art (today part of Central Saint Martins) in 1980 and came under the influence of artist Tam Giles, head of the Abstract and Experimental Department. This led to an interest in British Constructionism and particularly Kenneth Martin’s notion of ‘chance and order’, which Sharif developed into his own ‘Semi-system’ way of working – based around arbitrary or over-elaborate systems that are then followed to create works, often on a grid, from ‘Body and Squares’ (1983) to meticulously recording sentences read in a newspaper at points along a journey to Sharjah, to long sequences of black lines showing transformations of a line within a square. \\"I think of these markings as more of an engagement than an arrangement […] The important thing is the process.\\"‘Process and Provocation: An Interview with Hassan Sharif’; interview with David Ebony for Art In America magazine, 28 January 2014 Art as absurdist, process-based activity also fed Sharif’s early performances enacted in London and on return trips to the UAE during summer holidays – jumping in the desert, tying rope between rocks, and discussing art in the toilets of Byam Shaw School of Art with a member of the faculty. \\"For instance, I speak while my mouth is full of bread. I take a sip of water. I eat more bread, speak, drink some more water, and so on, recording all the sounds. All the while I'm talking about serious things like politics and art, but it's an ironic delivery, imitating politicians and lecturers.\\" Sharif in London, 1983 Sharif graduated in 1984 and set about staging the first exhibitions of contemporary art in the Emirates. He founded Al Marijah Art Atelier in Sharjah in 1984, a meeting place for a generation of young artists in the country, and assembled several interventions around the city including ‘One Day Exhibition’ (1985) and an impromptu exhibition in the city’s central market. In this period, Sharif also penned numerous articles in the UAE’s nascent press about the history of art and translated into Arabic excerpts of 20th-century art manifestos and texts (notably about Post- Impressionism, Cubism, Abstract Expressionism, Orphism, Futurism, Dada and Surrealism, Constructivism, Fluxus, Arte Povera, Minimalism and Conceptual Art) so as to provoke a local engagement and show that his work is grounded in a discourse. \\"I didn’t only make art but I made my audience too. I had to contextualise what I was doing.\\" In addition to his own practice, Sharif encouraged and supported several generations of artists in the Emirates. In 2007, he was one of the co-founders of The Flying House, a Dubai institution for promoting contemporary Emirati artists. He was a founding member of the Emirates Fine Arts Society (founded 1980) and of the Art Atelier in the Youth Theater and Arts, Dubai. Sharif’s works are held in notable institutional collections including M+, Hong Kong; Guggenheim New York; Guggenheim Abu Dhabi; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art, Doha; and the Sharjah Art Foundation. Sharif died on 18 September 2016 in Dubai.Rest in peace knight of UAE contemporary art He was 65. ‘Weaving’ Sharif in his studio From the early ‘80s, Sharif began creating assemblages from cheap, mass-produced materials or items sourced from the UAE’s markets. With these heaps – often large in scale – Sharif was handing back as artwork the surplus of a recently and rapidly-industrialised UAE. Similarly, \\"as illustrations of meaningless [sic], taking Duchampian philosophy to heart, they were crafted from commonplace materials, cut, bound or tied together with rope or wire, and thus stripped of their original function.\\"‘Hassan Sharif: Experiments and Objects 1979-2011’ by Kevin Jones, Art Asia Pacific His subsequent assemblages have incorporated coir, rope, copper wire, readymade domestic products, a crutch, newspapers dipped in glue and papier-mache. The process of bundling these objects together – ‘weaving’, as Sharif calls it – has had extraordinary influence on his broader practice, both in the repetitive gesture of tying to the rudimentary handmade nature of the process. \\"It’s important for me that art is easy, and technically anyone can do it. In that sense, my work is skill-less. I mean, you don't need special skills to make work that becomes art. I don't want the sculptures to appear to result from virtuosity. I'm not trying to make magic of some kind that would impress an audience as to how the work is created. There are no secrets.\\"‘Process and Provocation: An Interview with Hassan Sharif’; interview with David Ebony for Art In America magazine, 28 January 2014 In 2006, Sharif released an essay titled ‘Weaving’, which detailed the ideas that first initiated these objects, responding to what he calls a \\"vulgar market mentality that flooded shops with consumer goods\\".‘Weaving’, Hassan Sharif, 2006 \\"Despite the fact that my works are based on a sequential, industrial mode of creativity, they also demolish the sequential autonomy of an industrial product. I inject my works with a realism that exposes this socio-political economic monster, allowing people a chance to recognise the danger of over indulgence in this form of negative consumption.\\" Sharif continued to create objects throughout his career, but challenged the form throughout, at various times incorporating paintings, works on paper into the assemblage and using the form to create more figurative works. In 2014, Sharif began working with mass-produced images – bundling together printouts, glossy magazines and pages from books, as well as illustrations from a dictionary recreated at an exaggerated scale in iron and ‘woven’ together as assemblage. Exhibitions Sharif’s first public exhibition was at Dubai’s Central Public Library in 1976, showing his early ‘Caricature’ cartoons. Subsequently he participated in group shows at, amongst other venues, Whitechapel Gallery, London, New Museum, New York, and Centre Pompidou, Paris. A monograph of his career, Hassan Sharif Experiments & Objects 1979-2011, was curated by Catherine David and Mohammed Kazem at Qasr Al Hosn, Abu Dhabi, in 2011. Sharif exhibited in the Giardini della Biennale (Venice) at the 57th Venice Biennale, VIVA ARTE VIVA, Italy (2017), curated by Christine Macel.

History  The aim of the Ferry Service was to keep the besieged Allied forces supplied with ammunition, gun barrels, and medical supplies, while evacuating wounded personnel. The initial supply runs to Tobruk were performed by the ships of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla (which included the Australian 'Scrap Iron Flotilla') operating independently. A typical run saw a destroyer leave Alexandria early in the morning, after spending the night loading, then sail for Tobruk, where the ship would arrive around midnight. After supplies were unloaded and wounded loaded, the destroyer would sail for Mersa Matruh, where the wounded were exchanged for more supplies. The destroyer would return to Tobruk for a second evening, then head back to Alexandria. The danger of attack by air and sea prompted the admiral at Alexandria, after advice from one of the destroyer captains, to send ships in pairs: they could help protect each other, and if one were disabled or sunk, the second could provide assistance or recover survivors.

It can be used to help people that simply need reading glasses, and also those who have started to need bifocal or varifocal spectacle correction due to ageing changes in the eye. It can be used for people who are also short-sighted (myopia) or long-sighted (hyperopia) and who also may have astigmatism. Primarily the treatment is for a condition called presbyopia. Laser Blended Vision can be achieved through laser eye surgery, usually performed as LASIK, although surface laser eye surgery PRK or LASEK can be used to produce the effect. Laser Blended Vision works by increasing the depth of field of each eye through subtle changes in the optics of the corneal spherical aberration. The increase in depth of field allows for the eyes to be corrected in such a way that the dominant eye is set for distance and intermediate vision while the non-dominant eye sees best in the intermediate to near range. Because of the similarity in the visual performance of each eye in the intermediate range the brain is able to fuse the images between the eyes rendering a binocular visual environment. This is in contradiction to traditional monovision where the image disparity between the eyes is too high for image fusion by the brain and instead the brain needs to apply suppression of the blurred eye in order to perceive a clear visual field. In Laser Blended Vision, the eyes are effectively working together to allow good vision at near, intermediate and far, without the use of glasses. The effects of Laser Blended Vision tend to last between 5 and 10 years but can be further adjusted by enhancement procedures. Advantages of treatment Laser blended vision provides a range of benefits, particularly in comparison to traditional monivision solutions, such as bifocal glasses or contact lenses. The key advantage of Laser blended vision is the freedom from reading glasses. Between 95% and 98% of Laser Blended Vision patients can read normal newsprint and between 80% to 96% can read the very smallest print on medicine bottle inserts (J1 or N4 print size).,Non-linear aspheric ablation profiles for presbyopic LASIK using the MEL80 and CRS Master Laser Blended Vision module.

LaserReviews.co.uk http://www.lasikreviews.co.uk/laser-vision-correction-lasik-blended.htm There is a creation of intermediate and far-intermediate distance zone of binocular fusion, allowing the merging of images from each eye in the brain so no dissociation occurs between the eyes as with monovision.Presbyond Laser Blended Vision: Another approach to presbyopia. Dan Z. Reinstein. Eyeworld January 2013. http://www.eyeworld.org/article-presbyond-laser-blended-vision ---another-approach-to-presbyopia Due to increased depth of field in both eyes, the distance vision is significantly better than would otherwise be anticipated. Laser Blended Vision is a shape profile modification to the standard excimer laser eye surgery method that has been performed tens of millions of times worldwide, mostly as LASIK. LASIK provides a very high level of safety particularly when employing femtosecond laser flap creation (IntraLASIK) and eye tracker technology that tracks eye position at a feedback frequency significantly higher than the repetition rate of the excimer laser pulses themselves. Over the last ten years, refractive clear lens exchange has become a more common procedure for correcting presbyopia. Refractive clear lens exchange is basically the same surgery as that was previously only designated for eyes with visually impairing cataract, however it is now performed in eyes without cataract (i.e. a clear lens) for the purposes of gaining independence from glasses. A significant advantage of Laser Blended Vision is that it does not involve a surgery that requires entering the inside of eye, a requirement for all other intraocular lens alternatives that involve either intraocular lens monovision or the use of multifocal intraocular lenses. In contrast, Laser Blended Vision is generally more accurate at hitting the refractive target than intaocular lenses, and if target is not achieved, it is adjustable by a simple enhancement procedure (again, without entering the eye). Procedure =Preoperative screening= During the preoperative screening, a complete examination of the eye is carried out at a consultation with the surgeon to determine if a patient is suitable for Laser Blended Vision treatment. The dominant eye is determined and vision tested to identify the level of correction required for distance and near on the dominant eye and non-dominant eye. The analysis of ocular dominance and patient specific interocular suppression and binocular rivalry also allows for ensuring the eyes can work together to create the Laser Blended Vision effect. Unlike with monovision surgery where it is generally advised to perform a \\"monovision contact lens trial\\", Laser Blended Vision screening does not incorporate this as it would automatically exclude many suitable candidates from having the procedure. This is because a much larger proportion of people are suitable for Laser Blended Vision (>95%) than monovision (59-67%). =During Surgery and Post Operative= During the surgery, a corneal flap is created, during which there can be a sensation of slight pressure on the eye during the procedure. The non-dominant eye is covered and the dominant eye is opened and kept open by a speculum, the corneal flap is lifted and the laser correction is done – an ultra thin flap can be created for treatment of very high prescriptions.Accuracy and reproducibility of Artemis central flap thickness and visual outcomes of LASIK with the Carl Zeiss Meditec Visumax Femtosecond Laser and the MEL 80 Excimer Laser platforms. Journal of Refractive Surgery 2010, Feb 26: 107 – 19. DZ Reinstein, TJ Archer, M Gobbe, N Johnson. The flap is replaced and the speculum is removed. The dominant eye is treated next. The software data for each eye is stored in the Carl Zeiss Meditc MEL 80 laserCarl Zeiss Meditec AG (2010) “MEL80 Excimer Laser high performance meets versatility” Publicis v/2010 No. 0000001838386, Germany, USA. and delivered by the eye-tracker controlled computer generated excimer laser pulses. The laser time for each eye is usually under 30 seconds. The dominant eye is mainly corrected for distance and intermediate vision and the non-dominant eye is corrected for intermediate and near vision, by increasing the depth of focus for each eye. The entire procedure takes approximately 20 minutes for both eyes and the visual recovery is rapid and there is very little discomfort afterwards, usually described as if contact lenses had been left in for too long. The flap seals down usually within a few hours and the early postoperative recovery period usually about 7 days during which care is needed to not rub eyes and to wear eye shields during the night. The results are almost instantly available to the patient, where objects and people will seem more in focus, and most people can return to work the next day after their postoperative day 1 check. Suitability of treatment Laser blended vision treatment is suitable for people suffering from presbyopia. People mostly begin to suffer from presbyopia, refractive error between the ages of 40–45 years. As we age, the natural lens inside the eye grows, leading to a decrease in the ability of the eye to change its focus from distance to near, a process called accommodation (accommodation (eye)). There is still much controversy amongst experts as to the mechanism of accommodation of the eye, which is probably why the actual reversal of presbyopia is still not medically possible. Laser Blended Vision is suitable in general for anyone with presbyopia who is also a candidate for corneal laser eye surgery; the range of preoperative prescriptions that can be treated varies, but results have been published for laser blended vision using the Carl Zeiss Meditec MEL80 excimer laser for myopia (short-sightedness) up to -8.50D with astigmatism, hyperopia (long-sightedness) up to +6.00D with astigmatism and for patients who have emmetropia (good distance vision) but only need reading glasses for computers or near vision. Laser Blended Vision can also be performed after cataract surgery in order to increase the independence from spectacles. Similarly, cataract surgery can be performed together with Laser Blended Vision to provide a patient with better spectacle independence than can be afforded by simple monovision and without the decrease in quality of vision that is produced by a Multifocal intraocular lens. Multifocal intraocular lenses work by splitting the light entering the eye into different focal planes, hence resulting in an eye that never achieves 100% of light at distance or near, however these are increasingly commonly employed for the correction of presbyopia.

According to a comprehensive review of the medical literature conducted by Dr. BJ Evans,Monovision: a review. Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2007;27:417-439 only 59-67% of patients are tolerant to mono vision, compared to the tolerance to Laser Blended Vision in more than 95% of patients screened and treated. A year after Laser Blended Vision LASIK, approximately 95% of patients achieved 20/20 vision at distance while able to read newsprint type size at near. Limitations and potential complications The aim of this surgery is to produce one eye that sees mostly at distance, but still at near and the other eye that sees mostly at near, but also at distance. There is a period of adaptation to Laser Blended Vision which varies from a few weeks to up to a year; according to a study published in the Journal of Refractive Surgery by Professor Dan Reinstein and colleagues, the average patient is adapted within three months of treatment, and at one year 3% were not yet fully adapted. During adaptation patients may feel that the distance vision is strange, and this can produce some slight dizziness or visual discomfort in the initial phases for which a pair of glasses that reverse the difference between the eyes are prescribed. The risks and complications of Laser Blended Vision are identical to those of LASIK laser eye surgery as such. Laser Blended Vision does not carry specific increased serious risks relative to the standard LASIK laser eye surgery itself. As with all laser eye procedures, patients must familiarize themselves with the risks and side effects of the treatment, which is best done in consultation with an expert laser eye surgeon who performs the Laser Blended Vision procedure as a routine in his practice. Because of the improved control of induced spherical aberration the excimer laser employing Laser Blended Vision software enables treatment of higher levels of myopia without removing high amounts of corneal tissue,.Corneal ablation depth readout of the MEL80 Exicmer Laser compared to Artemis three- dimensional very high-frequency digital ultrasound stromal measurements.

After the procedure, artificial tears and antibiotic eye drops are used for at least a week which can cause temporary blurred vision and irritation. The sensation of dryness of the eyes is a common side-effect of LASIK and can be uncomfortable for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months after the surgery; most patients use artificial tears for this period of time after LASIK. Presbyopia is not reversed by Laser Blended Vision, which is a highly effective treatment but not a cure and as presbyopia is a progressive condition, a boost may be required some years after treatment. Typically the effects of Laser Blended Vision surgery last between 5–10 years and most patients are able to have an enhancement procedure to recover the benefits of the initial procedure.

Family background Ó Maol Chonaire was a member of the Ó Maolconaire brehon family of north County Roscommon in Connacht. A member of the Sliocht Pháidín, his genealogy was Fearfeasa mac Lochlainn mac Séan Ruadh (died 1589) mac Lochlainn mac Paidín Ó Maolconaire (died 1506). He was thus closely related to Muirgheas mac Pháidín Ó Maolconaire (died 1543) and his descendants, Fláithrí Ó Maol Chonaire (died 1629) and Muiris mac Torna Ó Maolconaire (died 1645). It has been suggested by Eoin Mac Cárthaigh that Fearfeasa's lands were in the townland of Creta, parish of Kiltrustan, beside that of his father, Lochlainn, who lived in Lisheen townland. Páidín Ruadh Ó Maol Chonaire, who retained two- thirds of his lands in Ballymulconry in the 1650s, may have been Fearfeasa's brother.

As a young man, he participated in the compilation of the Annals of the Four Masters, working with Mícheál Ó Cléirigh, Cú Choigcríche Ó Cléirigh, Peregrine Ó Duibhgeannain and other assistants. He is identified by Bernadette Cunningham as the scribe of hand E in the autograph of the Annals of the Four Masters. He participated in the compilation of the years up to 1333 with Ó Duibhgeannáin, the Ó Cléirigh's writing the rest of the book to 1616.

The hacker, David Kernell, had obtained access to Palin's account by looking up biographical details such as her high school and birthdate and using Yahoo!'s account recovery for forgotten passwords. Kernell then posted several pages of Palin's email on 4chan's /b/ board. Kernell, who at the time of the offense was a 20-year-old college student, was the son of longtime Democratic state representative Mike Kernell of Memphis. He was charged in October 2008 in federal court. After he was led into the court in leg irons and handcuffs, the judge released him on his own recognizance, pending trial. The incident was ultimately prosecuted in a U.S. federal court as four felony crimes punishable by up to 50 years in federal prison. The charges were three felonies: identity theft, wire fraud, and anticipatory obstruction of justice; and one optional as felony or misdemeanor: intentionally accessing an account without authorization. Kernell pleaded not guilty to all counts. A jury trial, featured testimony of Sarah and Bristol Palin, as well as 4chan founder Christopher Poole, began on April 20, 2010. The jury found Kernell guilty on two counts: the felony of anticipatory obstruction of justice and the misdemeanor of unauthorized access to a computer. On her Facebook page, Sarah Palin stated that she and her family were thankful the jury had rendered a just verdict. Kernell was sentenced on November 12, 2010, to one year plus a day in federal custody, followed by three years of supervised release. The sentencing judge recommended that the custody be served in a halfway house, but the Federal Bureau of Prisons sent him instead to a minimum security prison. He was released on November 23, 2011.Register No. 32341-074, Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved February 10, 2018. In January 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found Kernell's awareness of a possible future FBI investigation was enough to uphold a conviction on obstruction of justice.  Incident  Shortly after midnight on September 16, 2008, the private Yahoo! Mail account of Sarah Palin was cracked by a 4chan user. The hacker, known as \\"Rubico\\", claimed he had read Palin's personal e-mails because he was looking for something that \\"would derail her campaign.\\" After reading through Palin's emails, Rubico wrote, \\"There was nothing there, nothing incriminating — all I saw was personal stuff, some clerical stuff from when she was governor.\\" Rubico wrote that he used the Sarah Palin Wikipedia article to find Palin's birth date (one of the standard security questions used by Yahoo!.) in \\"15 seconds.\\" The hacker posted the account's password on /b/, an image board on 4chan, and screenshots from within the account to WikiLeaks. A /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an email to a friend of Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. This man was criticized heavily by the /b/ community, for being a \\"white knight\\". However, he did not blank out the password in the screenshot. A multitude of /b/ users then attempted to log in with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident was criticized by some /b/ users, one of whom complained that \\"seriously, /b/. We could have changed history and failed, epically.\\" The hacker admitted he was worried about being caught, writing \\"Yes I was behind a proxy, only one, if this sh*t ever got to the FBI I was fked, I panicked, I still wanted the stuff out there ... so I posted the [information] ... and then promptly deleted everything, and unplugged my internet and just sat there in a comatose state.\\" The hacker left behind traces of his activity. His IP address was logged at the proxy he used, CTunnel.com, and he also left his email address \`rubico10@yahoo.com\` when he posted at 4chan. Furthermore, the attacker revealed the original web address used by the proxy by leaving this information in the screenshot which according to experts can also help the investigation. 4chan's /b/ board is not archived, and posts are only retained for a short time. However, with the great interest surrounding the posts of Rubico, many, including wired.com, archived the original posts. The email address left behind was then connected to David Kernell through various social networking profiles where it was used, though no official investigation took place at this time. Campaign response John McCain's campaign condemned the incident, saying it was a \\"shocking invasion of the governor's privacy and a violation of law\\". Barack Obama's spokesman Bill Burton called the hacking \\"outrageous\\".  Federal investigation  The FBI and Secret Service began investigating the incident and on September 20, it was revealed that they were questioning David Kernell, a 20-year-old economics student at the University of Tennessee and the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell from Memphis. The handle used by the hacker when making his post at 4chan pointed to him, although this evidence was inconclusive because of the frequent pranks pulled at that board. The hacker's proxy service provided its logs, which pointed to Kernell's residence. FBI agents served a federal search warrant at David Kernell's apartment in Knoxville. Agents spent two hours taking pictures of everything inside his apartment. Kernell's three roommates were also subpoenaed and expected to testify the following week in Chattanooga. The obstruction of justice charge stems from an allegation by the FBI that Kernell attempted to erase evidence of the crime from his hard drive. Kernell's father told Wired that he was aware that his son was a suspect, but he did not ask him anything about it over concerns that he may have to testify in court.  Indictment  A second federal grand jury in Knoxville returned an indictment of Kernell on October 7, 2008. He was charged with violating and , or unlawful access to stored communications and intentionally accessing a computer without authorization across state lines, respectively. Kernell turned himself in the next day. Kernell pleaded not guilty. The court released Kernell on his own recognizance. Kernell's attorney claimed that using \\"an e-mail address and a birth date does not constitute identity theft\\"; however, the court rejected that argument saying \\"once Governor Palin chose the Yahoo! ID \`gov.palin@yahoo.com\`, that became her unique address, and no one else could choose it.\\"  Trial  In October 2008, Kernell was brought into court in handcuffs and ankle shackles to plead not guilty to the hacking and was released on bond. The case went to trial eighteen months later, on April 20, 2010. On April 23, Sarah Palin testified for 44 minutes. Her daughter, Bristol, testified as well.

Verdict and sentence  On April 30, 2010, David Kernell was found guilty on two of four counts: the felony of anticipatory obstruction of justice by destruction of records and found for the lower misdemeanor option of unauthorized access to a computer. The jury acquitted him of the charge of wire fraud. It was deadlocked on identity theft charge, so the judge declared a mistrial on that charge. In response, Palin issued a press release comparing the case to Watergate.

In November 2010 Kernell was sentenced to a year and a day of prison, preferably to be served in a halfway house, plus three years of probation, by U.S. District Judge Thomas Phillips, though he noted the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) could override his recommendations. However, the BOP, which makes the ultimate determination as to where federal prisoners serve their sentence, assigned Kernell to the minimum security prison at the Federal Correctional Institution, Ashland near Ashland, Kentucky.

Therefore, he sent Ali to them.Kitab al-tabaqat al-kabir, by Ibn Sa’d, volume 2, page 110 – 111 The people of Fadak surrendered without a fight, and pleaded for a peace treaty in exchange for giving away half their land and wealth to Mohammed. Fadak became Mohammad’s private property (a Fai), as there was no Muslim fighters involved in Fadak to share the booty with. Mohammed gave the wealth away to orphans and also used it to finance the marriage of needy young men. The Conquest of Fadak During the time of negotiation with the Khaybar Jews, Muhammad sent Mahsia bin Masood, to send a message to the Jews of Fadak, asking them to surrender their properties and wealth(accepting his terms) or be attacked. When the people of Fadak had heard of what happened to the Khaybar Jews, they were panic stricken. To spare their lives, they pleaded for a peace treaty, and in exchange requested Muhammad to take over one half of their wealth and property and banish them. After the Khaybar Jews surrendered to Muhammad and, having lost their only source of livelihood, they requested him to employ them back on their properties for half the share of the crop. Muhammad found it much more convenient to re-employ them, as the Jews were already very experienced with their land, whereas the Muslims (the new occupiers of their land) had no experience with agriculture and cultivation. So Muhammad made some conciliation to the Khaybar Jews by re-engaging them in their lost land, but on condition that he reserved the right to banish them any time he wished. The Jews had very little choice but to agree. The same terms were applied to the Fadak Jews. Fadak became Muhammad’s private property (a Fai), as there was no Muslim fighters involved in Fadak to share the booty with. Mohammed gave the wealth away to orphans and financed the marriage of needy young men.

The alleged violations include rape, extrajudicial killings, ethnic cleansing, misconduct and bombings of civilians. Libyan Armed Forces = Claims of systematic shooting at protesters = Luis Moreno Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, estimated that between 500 and 700 people were killed by Gaddafi's security forces in February 2011, before the rebels even took up arms. \\"Shooting at protesters was systematic,\\" Moreno-Ocampo stated, discussing the Libyan government's response to the initial anti-government demonstrations. The Libyan government denied that they ordered killings of demonstrators in the early days of the uprising. They said that soldiers acted in self-defense as they were attacked by mobs. Moreno-Ocampo further stated that during the conflict, \\"War crimes are apparently committed as a matter of policy\\" by forces loyal to Gaddafi. This is further supported by claims of Human Rights Watch, that 10 protesters, who had already agreed to lay down arms, were executed by a government paramilitary group in Bani Walid in May. In June 2011, an investigation carried out by Amnesty International claimed that allegations of use of anti- aircraft guns against crowds lack evidence, noting that rebels at times appeared to have made false claims or manufactured evidence. The used cartridges after protesters were shot at \\"came from Kalashnikovs or similar calibre weapons\\". According to the Amnesty investigation, \\"there is no proof of mass killing of civilians on the scale of Syria or Yemen\\", adding that in Bengazi 100 to 110 people were killed, and in Baida 59 to 64 people were killed. Most of these were probably protesters, and some might have had weapons. However, in a later report from Amnesty International it was found that \\"al-Gaddafi forces committed serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL), including war crimes, and gross human rights violations,which point to the commission of crimes against humanity. They deliberately killed and injured scores of unarmed protesters; subjected perceived opponents and critics to enforced disappearance and torture and other ill- treatment; and arbitrarily detained scores of civilians. They launched indiscriminate attacks and attacks targeting civilians in their efforts to regain control of Misratah and territory in the east. They launched artillery, mortar and rocket attacks against residential areas. They used inherently indiscriminate weapons such as anti-personnel land mines and cluster bombs,including in residential areas.\\"Amnesty International, The Battle for Libya: Killings, Disappearances and Torture, 13 September 2011, MDE 19/025/2011 In July 2011, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi had an interview with Russia Today, where he denied the ICC's allegations that he or his father ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He contended that as he was not a member of the government or the military, he therefore had no authority to give such orders. According to Saif, he made recorded calls to General Abdul Fatah Younis (who later defected to the rebel forces) to request that force not be used against protesters, to which Younis responded that they were attacking a military site, where surprised guards fired in self-defense. = Allegations of mass rape = A Libyan psychologist, Seham Sergiwa, conducted a survey of refugees in Tunisia and Egypt to document the trauma of the civil war. Nearly 300 women were reported to have been raped. The real number could be much higher, considering the stigma attached to rape victims in Libyan society. Every single woman in the survey who admitted to being raped said they were raped by loyalist soldiers or militiamen. United Nations war-crimes expert M. Cherif Bassiouni, Human Rights Watch (HRW), Doctors Without Borders and Amnesty International stated that they found no evidence of systematic rape conducted by the Libyan government. Amnesty International's Donatella Rovera said that the Benghazi rebels had knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence, quoting one example of pristine boxes of Viagra that the rebels said were found inside a totally burned out tank belonging to Gaddafi's troops. This raised serious doubts about the claim that Gaddafi handed out Viagra to his soldiers to enable them to rape more efficiently. Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) collected testimony of eyewitness who reported that pro-Gaddafi forces transformed an elementary school into a detention site where they raped women and girls as young as 14 years old.Physicians for Human Rights. \\"Witness to War Crimes: Evidence from Misrata, Libya.\\" https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/Libya-WitnesstoWarCrimes-Aug2011.pdf.

PHR also reports of honor killings that occurred in response to these rapes. = Use of land mines as a means of war = Human Rights Watch has confirmed claims of rebels, that pro-Gaddafi forces used land mines frequently during the conflict. It found them on at least six different locations in Libya, mostly on frontlines of the Gaddafi forces. Among these land mines are not only anti-tank mines, but also anti-personnel mines, which can permanently pose a threat to civilians. = Shelling of civilian areas = Gaddafi forces have been accused by human-rights groups of shelling towns with heavy weapons, risking civilian lives indiscriminately. The most accusations refer to the siege of Misrata, accusing Gaddafi forces of targeting hospitals and civilian areas, also using internationally outlawed cluster bombs of Spanish production as ammunition, having risked the lives of civilians. = Other abuses of non-combatants = A Human Rights Watch report documents the \\"unlawful occupation and terror of hospital staff\\" by pro-Government forces in Yafran in the western mountains, risking the lives of the patients and terrifying the staff contrary to international law. In August 2011, Physicians for Human Rights released a report documenting severe violations of human rights and evidence of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity in Misrata. Findings included that Qaddafi forces used civilians as human shields, attacked ambulances bearing the Red Crescent, destroyed religious buildings, and intentionally starved civilians. In the same report, PHR gave evidence to violations of medical neutrality, such as attacks on medical facilities, medical transport, and medical workers. Anti-Gaddafi forces =Crimes against international humanitarian law= Execution of prisoners of war A group of 15 to 22 Libyan army soldiers captured in Derna were reportedly executed in the neighboring village of Martuba. According to a widely circulated story, the men were claimed to have been \\"executed by their own officers for disobeying orders\\". Another group of 15 dark-skinned Libyan prisoners were publicly executed by hanging in front of the Bayda courthouse. Murder and torture of injured soldiers On 17 February, the Bayda hospital admitted two injured men, one of darker complexion and the other of olive complexion. The men were accused of fighting against the rebels. A hospital doctor claimed that the black man was murdered and hung by an angry mob that had gathered around the hospital. The other injured man was reportedly beaten, shot and returned to the emergency room. = Lootings and beatings= In four towns in the western mountains captured in June by the opposition, HRW noticed looting of private property and beatings of alleged Gaddafi sympathizers by rebel forces. The National Transitional Council (NTC) then pledged to hold responsible the causers of the attacks and to prevent such abuses in the future. = Killing of civilians = During the Battle of Sirte, the rebels killed many civilians, including men, women, and children, while there were also reports of the rebels harassing and stealing from the locals. According to one resident, \\"The rebels are worse than rats. NATO is the same as Osama bin Laden.\\" According to another local woman, \\"We lived in democracy under Muammar Gaddafi, he was not a dictator. I lived in freedom, Libyan women had full human rights. It isn't that we need Muammar Gaddafi again, but we want to live just as we did before.\\" A local elderly woman stated \\"They are killing our children. Why are they doing this? For what? Life was good before!\\" NATO airstrikes On 9 August, the Libyan government claimed that 85 civilians were killed in NATO airstrikes on the village of Majer near Zliten. A NATO spokesman said that they were targeting four buildings in which nine vehicles were destroyed and that government claim \\"was not corroborated by available factual information at the site\\". The Libyan government declared three days of national mourning. Reporters were later taken to a hospital where they saw at least 30 dead bodies, including the bodies of at least two young children. The Libyan government claimed that the bodies of others killed in the airstrikes were taken to other hospitals. Neither of these claims were independently verified, although some media outlets came to the conclusion that it seemed more credible than usual that something tragic happened due to the presence of at least 14 bodies at one hospital, including an infant. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said a council-mandated investigation of NATO involvement in the Libyan Civil War is essential \\"given the fact that initially we were led to believe by NATO leaders there are zero civilian casualties of their bombing campaign.\\" The U.S. and France called Russia's demand for an investigation \\"a distraction\\" Other =Allegations of Human rights watch groups falsifying claims= Some journalists have accused human-rights organizations of falsifying claims, that Gaddafi was using mercenaries from other parts of Africa to attack protesters, Among the sources pointing to the existence of mercenaries are the claims by Gaddafi's former Chief of Protocol Nouri Al Mismari, who has claimed the presence of mercenaries from countries such as Chad, Niger, and Mali.Namunane, Bernard (25 February 2011). \\"Kenya: 'Dogs of War' Fighting for Gaddafi\\".

Murder of guest workers and black Libyans The Chadian government called on coalition forces to protect its citizens in rebel-held areas in Libya. It claimed that dozens had been accused and executed for allegedly being mercenaries in the pay of Gaddafi. A Turkish oil worker reported witnessing the murder of 70 to 80 Sudanese and Chadian guest workers with pruning shears and axes by Libyans who accused them of being Gaddafi mercenaries. HRW's Peter Bouckaert visited Bayda where 156 supposed mercenaries were being held captive. He reported that these men were actually black Libyans from Southern Libya. He argued that the support of the black southern Libyans for the Gaddafi regime was explainable, as Gaddafi fought to counter discrimination against them in Libyan society. In the same interview, Bouckaert also said that those 156 individuals were released by the rebels less than two weeks after being captured. Killings of unarmed migrant workers by insurgents have been described. On 18 April, a British reporter who had just arrived at Benghazi by sea from Misrata described the sufferings of large numbers of migrant workers trapped in Misrata in a broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

It is the earliest fiddle tunebook to have survived from northern England, and hence an important source for Northumbrian music in the late 17th century. The title page carries the inscription, in a fine hand, Henry Atkinson, his book, 1694. 1694 is presumably the date the book was begun. A small 5 is apparently written below the 4, suggesting that the book was continued into the following year. The man Matt Seattle has written that elsewhere in the book there also appear the names Ralph Atkinson and Elinor Atkinson, suggesting a tentative identification of the book's compiler as one Henry Atkinson, a hostman (coal factor) of Newcastle. He had been enrolled as an apprentice in April 1686, where it is recorded that his father, also Henry, was a yeoman of Gateshead, then in County Durham. He completed this apprenticeship in February 1694, when he was admitted to the guild of hostmen, and in July of the same year he married Eleanor Forster. The couple had two children, Ralph (1696-1701) and Mary (1698- 1706), and Eleanor died in 1706. A grandson of this Henry by his second marriage to Margaret Lawson was also named Ralph;A History of Northumberland in Three Parts, Pt 2, v. 2, p.194, John Hodgson, Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne Henry died in 1759, at the age of 89. Julia Say has checked that the signature on his will matches writing in the manuscript, confirming that he was its compiler. He belonged to a family of merchants, many called Ralph or Henry, who had been living in Newcastle and Gateshead since before 1603. The family later became very prominent, two of Henry's grandchildren, by his second marriage, being Lord Stowell and Lord Eldon. Some time after the death of Henry's grandson Ralph in 1827, the manuscript passed into the possession of William Andrew Chatto who added his own name to the title page in 1834. He also annotated some tune titles, pasted in some newspaper cuttings, and wrote elsewhere that Henry Atkinson \\"was a native of Northumberland, and lived in the vicinity of Hartburn\\". This statement seems to have been a misunderstanding on his part. While Ralph Atkinson did live in Angerton Hall, near Hartburn, he only acquired this property from the Earl of Carlisle later in the 18th century, after Henry's death. The identification of Henry places him firmly in the urban middle class of Newcastle and Gateshead, rather than rural Northumberland. Some years after Chatto had acquired it, the manuscript was in the possession of the composer Sir Henry Bishop, Heather Professor of Music at Oxford. After his death in 1855, it was given to the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries in 1857. This was shortly after the Society's Ancient Melodies Committee had begun collecting early manuscripts of local music. The manuscript There is more than one handwriting in the manuscript, both for the music and for titles - compare for instance Chickens and Sparrow Grass and Flower of Yarraw. There is also considerable variability in the accuracy of the notation, so that whereas some tunes are meticulously detailed, showing bowings and ornaments, others are very vague and inconsistent as to barring and note durations. One idiosyncrasy is a tendency to leave dots off notes that should be dotted - however this rarely obscures the sense. He also tended to show key signatures redundantly, so that G major is indicated with 2 sharps, for both high and low f sharp, which was conventional enough at this time. The manuscript is now in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, and is held in the Northumberland Record Office. Much of it may be viewed online on the FARNE archive, with some notes by Matt Seattle, at http://www.asaplive.com/archive/index.asp. Some 13 of the tunes were transcribed in detail, including the bowings and ornaments, in Seattle's book Morpeth Rant,Morpeth Rant, Matt Seattle, Dragonfly Music, (1990) now unfortunately out of print. The music The book contains over 200 tunes, including early versions of several characteristic north-eastern and Border tunes, about one third of them untitled, and many unidentified. They include early versions of several characteristic local tunes. Among these are Brave Willie Forster which is now used for the song Bobby Shaftoe. Another is Flower of Yarraw which since the Jacobite uprisings has been known in Northumberland as Sir John Fenwick's the Flower amang them. The collection also includes two distinct variation set versions of Gingling Geordie, a tune which survives to this day as the long variation set for Northumbrian smallpipes Wylam Away. The tune I was young and lusty when I kent ye appears again, in a different mode and with variations for Border pipes, in the William Dixon manuscript from 40 years later; its title survives in the lyric of the song Sair fyel'd hinny, which is still sung in the region today, though to a different melody; the old tune does fit the lyric. Some 17 of the tunes are explicitly identified as 'Scotch', or have Scottish titles, while numerous others are also found in sources from north of the border. One of the tunes, an unnamed common-time Scots measure, appears again as the Shepherd's Hornpipe in Robert Bewick's manuscripts, where it seems to be derived from an Irish version, and it still remains current in Northumberland - Billy Pigg recorded a Scottish version of it, The Cairdin' o't. Many of the tunes are explicitly in fiddle settings, with the bowings and ornaments clearly marked; Prince Eugin's March has extensive double stoppings, and another, London's loyalty, is an early example of scordatura notation. Some pieces are related to tunes recently published or composed in London - a few of these are attributed to named composers, including Purcell. Some other tunes, though written out for fiddle, are apparently pipe tunes, with their characteristic 9-note range and figuration: Curds and Whey, \\"Saw yee not my Meggy\\" and The Lad that keeps the Cattle are examples of this type. Concordances The manuscript is particularly informative in that it contains tunes found in contemporary and later collections, but often in distinct variants. Curds and Whey, with 3 distinct strains here, appears in a similar version with more variations, in the George Skene manuscript, written in Aberdeenshire some 20 years later, there called Wat ye what I got late yestreen; in The Northern Minstrel's Budget a verse list of tunes from the early 19th century, the title of this appears as And I got yesternight curds and whey, suggesting that Atkinson's and Skene's titles are both fragments of the same lyric. Another tune in the book, The Reed House Rant, here with 8 strains, also appears elsewhere - Playford printed a different variant as \\"A Jig divided 12 ways\\", while it appeared again half a century later as an Old Lancashire Hornpipe in Walsh's Compleat Collection, and later still back in Newcastle, as a 2-strain version in the William Vickers manuscript. Another tune in the manuscript, a triple-time hornpipe called Uncle John seems to be connected, melodically, harmonically and structurally, with Madam Catbrin's Hornpipe, from Marsden's collection of 1705. The detailed relationships between many of the tunes in this manuscript and tunes in other roughly contemporary sources from both sides of the border remain to be explored more fully. Dating Some of the tunes were very new at the time the book was being written - Boyne, a new Jock March presumably commemorates the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and England's Lamentation for the late Q. Mary was certainly written after her death at the end of 1694. The manuscript includes a version of Purcell's Britons, Strike Home!, from Bonduca which was first performed in October 1695, and which Atkinson presumably copied out after this point. Several of the tunes are similar to versions published by Playford in 1698, but may have been circulating aurally before publication. Other tunes are of Lowland Scottish origin, and are found in similar versions north of the border. Where must our Goodman lie, perhaps originally a pipe tune, is found at about the same time in the Balcarres lute manuscript from about 1695 and the George Bowie fiddle manuscript of 1705, both in a more elaborate 6-strain setting by John MacLaughlan, of Edinburgh. An earlier appearance of this tune, though in a somewhat different 2-strain version, was published in 1686 by Playford as The Black and Grey. It may well have been current in oral tradition well before this, however. The latest date anyone has suggested for any tune in the book, for The Earle of Darwin's Farewell, is 1716, when James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater was executed for his part in the 1715 rebellion. However, the tune is a happy-sounding D major minuet, so connecting it to Derwentwater's execution seems unlikely. It may, however, be connected to some earlier event in that family's history, perhaps James and his brother being sent to France, and the exiled court of the Old Pretender, in 1702,Craster, History of Northumberland, Volume X, p. 319. but in any case its name must definitely post-date the creation of the earldom in 1688. Musical forms Many of the musical forms used, popular dances at the time, are no longer common, including 33 minuets, a gavotte, 3 bourees and a saraband. Other forms are less current now than then, including 13 triple-time hornpipes, and some jigs with 4-bar or 6-bar strains, though examples of these are still played in the region. Another form, the Scots measure, of which there are 18 in the manuscript, is no longer found as such, though many such tunes survive as common-time hornpipes, or in Northumberland, as rants. Most of the tunes have relatively few strains, particularly compared with the somewhat later William Dixon manuscript, which has several tunes in common with it; however there are three examples of long variation sets in this collection, all related to versions in Playford's Division Violin, published in 1684. Although the collection is very much of its time, reflecting the fashions and the currently popular tunes of the 1690s, many of the tunes in it still survive in modern versions, and forms current today, such as jigs, reels, common-time hornpipes and slip jigs, are found.

The novel is set during the Gallic Campaigns of Julius Caesar. The main protagonist of the novel is Vercingetorix and the plot follows his rise to power to become king of the Gauls and his eventual surrender to Caesar at the Battle of Alesia. The book is a novelisation of an early version of the script for Vercingétorix, la Légende du Druide Roi, a French language film. Development While working on the script for the French Language film Vercingétorix, la Légende du Druide Roi, Spinrad collaborated on many revisions with the director Jacques Dorfmann. Friends of Spinrad had really enjoyed earlier versions of the script, but when the fourteenth revision was produced, Spinrad was unhappy with it, so decided to revive the earlier third revision as a novel. In researching the novel, Spinrad was forced to largely rely on Caesar's accounts of the events, however he used the internet to help do additional research into the lifestyle and culture of the Gauls. Genre Though the novel is set in historical setting and uses conventions of historical fiction. However, one reviewer noted that the novel felt like high fantasy without the magic and magical creatures. Plot The novel begins as Caesar searches for an excuse to use his Roman legions in Gaul in order to gain political capital in Rome. He makes a deal with Diviaxc of the Edui tribe, to allow the Romans to trade with the tribe and hurt another tribe attacking the Gauls. Caeser means to use the alliance and trade activities to provoke some sort of war with the Gauls and precipitate war between Rome and the Gauls. Meanwhile, Vercingetorix follows his father, who is the elected leader of the Arverni. and observes a gathering held by his father which seeks to bring together the Gallic tribes in order to oppose Roman expansion. His father attempts to become a king over all the tribes, but the other leaders resist and capture Vercingetorix's father and kill him. Vercingetorix barely escapes their pursuit with the help of the arch druid, Guttuatr. Guttuatr takes Vercingetorix under his wing, and trains him to become a druid. While training with the Druids he encounters the amazon warrior, Rhea, who teaches him how to fight and vows to always be his sister warrior upon her virginity. Caesar decides to invade Britain, offering the Gauls half of the pillage if they accompany him. However, unbeknownst to the Gallic allies, Caesar plans to send the Gauls ahead of him into battle in order for many of their warriors and leaders to be killed. While traveling north with his column of Roman infantry and his Gallic allies, Caesar encounters Vercingetorix who has left the druid training in order to reclaim his father's wealth amongst the Arverni. Vercingetorix is again elected their leader. Soon, Vercingetorix takes a military force to join Ceaser's invasion of Britain. At the camp, Vercingetorix is again reintroduced to his childhood love Marah, who has become enamoured with Caesar. Though Caesar attempts to bring Vercingetorix under his wing, Vercingetorix has a falling out with Caesar after the death of another Gallic leader. Vercingetorix becomes outlawed and Caesar leaves a portion of his army to subdue the Gallic forces which rebelled against him. This force effectively subdues Gaul before Caesar returns victorious from Britain and when Caesar returns, they have garrisoned all of the major Gallic cities. Vercingetorix resists, and eventually, through support of the high druid and political maneuvering, gains the support of the various Gallic factions. United, the next year they resist the Roman Army through a combination of scorched earth and Guerrilla tactics, overcoming the Roman superiority through discipline. However, Caesar realizing that the Gaul's could not resist a siege, and after months of maneuvering, forces Vercingetorix to move his army to Alesia where the superior siege technology of the Romans traps Vercingetorix in the city, and successfully resists the reinforcements of the all the tribes of Gaul. Style The language of the novel has been called full of \\"vivid details\\" and one reviewer noted that the language was the most enticing part of the novel. John Snider noted that the novel is particularly good at retelling the details of battle scenes. Themes Selfless heroism is central to the novel, one reviewer noting that the heroism could be compared to that represented in the Arthurian legends. Reception John Snider of the online Science Fiction magazine Scifidimensions called the book fantastic, noting it as particularly vivid novel which beautifully retells the story of Vercingetorix. The Copperfield Review also noted that Spinrad immerses the reader in a vivid retelling of the historical setting. However, The Independent noted that the book was highly professional and predictable but did not have as much passion and depth as other novels.

Annie notices that her purple gel grip pen is missing, but the others dismiss her concerns. This enrages Annie, who claims she's tired of lending her stuff and not get it back, so she demands everyone to stay to find the pen. Unsuccessful in finding the pen, the group starts to leave, not before Annie accuses Britta of being the one who stole it. This escalates to a full search of everyone's stuff, and everyone starts to accuse each other. Annie tries to get Jeff to take control of the situation, but when Jeff's advice to the group is taken as an admission of guilt, he institutes a lockdown, forcing everyone to stay in the room until the pen is found. As they work through the bags, they discover disconcerting secrets about each member of the study group. Abed's journal is discovered to have been tracking the three women's menstrual cycles so that he knows the best days to talk to them. They discover a pregnancy test in Shirley's bag; she claims that she rekindled her relationship with her ex-husband over Labor Day weekend, but Abed points out that his charts show that she was last ovulating during Halloween. Shirley and Britta get into a heated argument about religion and sex before Jeff snaps and tears apart the room looking for the pen. The group proposes strip-searching each other to prove no one has taken it, dividing the room by gender to search themselves, to no avail. Eventually, they decide Pierce must have stuck it down one of his leg casts. They cut the casts open, but the pen is not there. The group sits around in regret and Jeff points out the bonds between them were so strong, it was impossible for anyone to have taken the pen and still not have confessed.

Gandrung has many variations and is popular in Bali, Lombok and East Java among the Balinese, Sasak and Javanese (especially the Osing Javanese). The most popular variation is gandrung from the Banyuwangi region in the eastern peninsula of Java, so much that the city is often referred as Kota Gandrung or \\"the city of gandrung\\". Originally a ritual dance dedicated to the goddess of rice and fertility, Dewi Sri, it is currently performed as a social dance of courtship and love in communal and social events, or as a tourist attraction. Gandrung Sewu Festival is held at Banyuwangi annually.  Descriptions  Gandrung Sewu Students of Sebelas Maret University dancing the jejer portion of gandrung Gandrung derives its name from the Javanese word for \\"love\\". It is theorized that the dance originated as a ritual dance to express the people's affection for the rice goddess Dewi Sri, with trance and as a kind of fertility dance. However, it has now lost its ritual connotations, especially among the Muslim Javanese and the Sasak. The dance has evolved into a social dance describing a girl looking for love companions. The dance has thus been de-ritualized, and has mostly lost its connections with the rice goddess. Gandrung is usually performed in an all-night performance that begins sometime around 9 p.m. and ends just before dawn. It is also commonly performed as a tourist attraction, for example in Bali or in Grajagan Bay in Banyuwangi. It is also performed as a social dance at communal and social events such as circumcisions or weddings. The gandrung, or main dancer, is usually an unmarried girl or a transvestite (or simply a boy playing the role of a female dancer). The dancer is dressed in traditional costume, with a fan, shawl and ornamental headgear. Often there will be more than one gandrung dancer in the performance. Gandrung usually starts with the dancer(s) at the side of stage, surrounded by the gamelan ensemble. When the music starts, the dancer begins dancing with hip thrusts and moves to the center stage. When the gandrung spots an audience member she wishes to dance with, she throws her shawl to him to bring him to the stage. The dancer and the audience member will then dance together. If there is more than one gandrung dancer in the performance, each dancer will choose a different partner to dance with. The audience member who has danced with the gandrung usually gives a small amount of money as token of appreciation. Gandrung is now also performed as dance of courtship and love between girls and boys in central and eastern Lombok. It is usually performed outdoors by the young men and women of the village with everyone standing around in a circle. Similar dances are known throughout the Indonesian archipelago, such as ronggeng or tayuban in East and Central Java, jaipongan in West Java and Banten, and joged in Jakarta.  Music  The dance is performed to the tunes of a traditional ensemble similar to the gamelan, often composed of two violins, gendangs, bonang and gongs with gamelan xylophones (gambang). A singer is also present to sing the accompanying song for the gandrung performance. Villages in Banyuwangi, Bali and Lombok sometimes have their own gandrung music ensemble. Variations in ensemble composition exist between the different areas where gandrung is performed. The music has been described as \\"vibrant and earthy\\" and has been recorded by several anthropologists.

It was marked by laws and edicts that punished pagan practices. Laws dating from the 350s prescribed the death penalty for those who performed or attended pagan sacrifices, and for the worshipping of idols; temples were shut down, and the Altar of Victory was removed from the Senate meeting house. There were also frequent episodes of ordinary Christians destroying, pillaging, desecrating, vandalizing many of the ancient pagan temples, tombs and monuments. Paganism was still popular among the population at the time. The emperor's policies were passively resisted of many governors and magistrates.\\"A History of the Church\\", Philip Hughes, Sheed & Ward, rev ed 1949, vol I chapter 6. Herbermann contends that the anti-paganism legislation had an unfavourable influence on the Middle Ages and become the basis of the Inquisition. Beginning of anti- pagan laws Constantius II's legislation began with the banning of the pagan practice of sacrifice.Kirsch, J. (2004) God against the Gods, pp.200-1, Viking CompassThe Codex Theodosianus On Religion, 16.10.2 This was in keeping with his personal maxim was: \\"Cesset superstitio; sacrificiorum aboleatur insania\\" (Let superstition cease; let the folly of sacrifices be abolished).C. G. Herbermann & Georg Grupp, \\"Constantine the Great\\", Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911, New Advent web site. According to Libanius, Constantius was effectively under the control of others who inspired him to end pagan sacrifices.\\"Libanius Oration\\" 30.7, For the Temples, With the collapse of official government sanctioned pagan rites, private cults attempted to infiltrate the temples. In the year 353 Constantius prohibited pagan sacrifice under the penalty of death. He also shut down some temples, forbade access to them, and ended their subsidies of public taxes.\\"The Codex Theodosianus On Religion\\", XVI.x.4, 4 CE Consistent with Christian theology, Constantius carried out on an active campaign against magicians, astrologers and other diviners. This may also be due to his becoming fearful that others might use these means to make someone else emperor.Theodosian Code 9.16.4, 9.16.5, 9.16.6 Herbermann contends that the anti-paganism policies, beginning with Constantius, would in time have an unfavourable influence on the Middle Ages and become the basis of the Inquisition. =Relative moderation= The emperor never attempted to disband the various Roman priestly colleges or the Vestal Virgins,Vasiliev, A.A, History of the Byzantine Empire 324–1453 (1958), p. 68 He never acted against the various pagan schools. He ordered the election of a priest for Africa. Also, he remained pontifex maximus until his death, and was deified by the Roman Senate after his death. The relative moderation of Constantius' actions toward paganism is reflected by the fact that it was not until over 20 years after Constantius' death, during the reign of Gratian, that any pagan senators protested their religion's treatment.Salzman, M.R., The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire (2002), p. 182 Pagan Resistance The government's policies could not be rigidly executed due to the strength of paganism among the population.Catholic Encyclopedia (1914) Flavius Julius ConstantiusAmmianus Marcellinus Res Gestae 9.10, 19.12. quote summary: Ammianus describes pagan sacrifices and worship taking place openly in Alexandria and Rome. The Roman Calendar of 354 cites many pagan festivals as though they were still being openly observed. See also the descriptions of pagan worship in the following works: Firmicius Maternus De Errore Profanorum Religionum; Vetus Orbis Descriptio Graeci Scriptoris sub Constantio. No matter what the imperial edicts declared in their fearful threats, the vast numbers of pagans, and the passive resistance of pagan governors and magistrates rendered them largely impotent in their application.Bowder, D. (1978) The Age of Constantine and Julian However, the effects of policy were enough to contribute to a widespread trend towards Christian conversion, though not enough to make paganism extinct. Persecution by ordinary Christians A cult statue of the deified Augustus, disfigured by a Christian cross carved into the emperor's forehead. Some Christians encouraged the emperor to take even more extreme measures in their zeal to stamp out paganism, e.g. in the aftermath of the abolition of sacrifices. Firmicus Maternus, a convert to Christianity, urged: \\"Paganism, most holy emperors, must be utterly destroyed and blotted out, and disciplined by the severest enactments of your edicts, lest the deadly delusion of the presumption continue to stain the Roman world\\" and \\"How fortunate you are that God, whose agents you are, has reserved for you the destruction of idolatry and the ruin of profane temples.\\" Sozomen contends that Constantius did not, apparently, attempt to stop the Christians from destroying and pillaging many of the ancient temples.Ammianus Marcellinus Res Gestae 22.4.3Sozomen Ecclesiastical History 3.18. However, in the Theodosian Code there is a law for the preservation of the temples that were situated outside of city walls.Theodosian Code 16.10.3 Constantius enacted another law that exacted a fine from those who were guilty of vandalizing sites holy to pagans and placed the care of these monuments and tombs under the pagan priests.Theodosian Code 9.17.2 Magnentius rebellion Magnentius rebelled against and killed Constans. Although he used Christian symbols on his coins, he revoked the anti-paganism legislation of Constans and even permitted the celebration of nocturnal sacrifices. Three years later, in the year 353, Constantius defeated Magnentius and once again forbade the performance of the rituals.Theodosian Code 16.10.5 This law seems to have had little effect as we find Constantius once again legislating against paganism in 356. Constantius now declared that anyone found guilty of attending sacrifices or of worshipping idols would be executed.Theodosian Code 16.10.6 It appears the magistrates were uncomfortable with carrying out this law; it was largely ignored. Removal of the Altar of Victory In 357 Constantius removed the Altar of Victory in the Senate house because of the complaints of some Christian Senators. This altar had been installed by Augustus in 29 BC; each Senator had traditionally made a sacrifice upon the altar before entering the Senate house. This altar was later restored, either silently, soon after Constantius' departure, or by the emperor Julian.Sheridan, J.J.

It creates a so-called \\"red ink\\" rule, that there is no limit to verbal rearrangement that the court may deploy to give a commercial sensible meaning when construing a contract in its bargaining context. It also, importantly, reaffirmed the rule of English law, that pre-contractual negotiations were ordinarily inadmissible when construing a contract. Facts Persimmon agreed to get planning permission, build some residences on Chartbrook’s land at 1 to 9 Hardwicks Way, Wandsworth, and then sell the properties. Chartbrook would pay for it, subject to a balancing payment or ‘additional residential payment’ (ARP) defined as ‘23.4% of the price achieved for each residential unit in excess of the minimum guaranteed residential unit value less the costs and incentives.’ This would be paid by Persimmon to Chartbrook. Chartbrook calculated this to mean £4,484,862 but Persimmon said on a proper construction the amount was £897,051. Persimmon argued that even if they were wrong on construction of the document, rectification should be granted, and if not their pre-contractual negotiations should be taken into account. Chartbrook argued the precontractual negotiations were inadmissible. The High Court and Court of Appeal agreed with Chartbrook's interpretation. Persimmon Ltd appealed on the interpretation given and argued that if they failed on those grounds, the contract should be construed in light of previous negotiations, or that the court should allow for the document to be rectified, because it was clear that the intentions of the parties was different from that found. Accordingly, it contended that the rule in Prenn v Simmonds[1971] 1 WLR 1381 that pre contractual negotiations should be ignored, was an illogical rule and should be overturned. Judgment The House of Lords held that Persimmon’s interpretation was right, and the amount due was £897,051. There was no limit to the ‘red ink’ that the court could use to correct the verbiage when it was clear that in its commercial context, an agreement could not make sense. The only requirement was that it should be clear to a reasonable person what was meant. It was rejected that pre-contractual negotiations should be taken into account.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in the grounds of Eldon House, to the east of the A3057 road, some south of Stockbridge. History The church was built in the later part of the 12th century. By the 18th century its condition was dilapidated and the east wall was rebuilt in 1729. Its fabric subsequently deteriorated again, and in 1864 it was being used as a cowshed. Its condition continued to be bad, and in 1973 it had the appearance of a farm building, and a report stated \\"Its sole occupant is a beautiful white owl\\". The church was declared redundant on 21 December 1971, and it was vested in the Redundant Churches Fund (the forerunners of the Churches Conservation Trust) on 31 May 1973. In 1975 the church was repaired, including re-tiling the roof and re-plastering the interior. Further repairs were undertaken in 1984. The church is open daily for visitors. Architecture St John's is constructed in flint rubble, partly rendered, with stone dressings. The rebuilt east wall is in brick, and the roofs are tiled. Its plan consists of a single rectangular cell long by long. The north wall contains two original single-light windows about wide and tall. At the east end of the north wall is part of another window that was cut in half when the east wall was rebuilt. The west wall contains one similar window, as does the south wall which also contains another window cut in half. The east wall contains another similar window, a wider 19th-century copy of the original windows. At each corner of the church is a buttress. Around the rest of the church, other than along the east end, is a moulded string course at the level of the window sills. In the south wall is a doorway with a pointed arch that was rebuilt in the 20th century. Around the church are nine consecration cross stones. Each of these consists of a circle in which there are five holes which formerly held metal crosses.

Set in the 1920s, the series, written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft, featured a large cast of recurring characters, both above and below stairs. Other non-household characters include friends of both the family and the servants, the staff of the Union Jack Rubber Company and various others. The Meldrum Family *Colonel George, Lord Meldrum MC (Donald Hewlett) - The master of the house, Lord Meldrum is a respected member of the gentry. In the early 1890s he had married the only daughter of Lord and Lady Southwick and they had raised two children prior to his wife's death. He first started his fortune when he married his wife. In 1915 he had been conscripted as a Colonel into the British Army and had served in the Infantry on the Western Front. He has old-fashioned Victorian values, with a respectable title and position in society. However, his reputation is threatened by his affair with Lady Agatha, the wife of Sir Ralph Shawcross, and it is usually left to Alf to help him cover this up. He claims to deeply love Agatha, and is left heartbroken after she breaks off their affair. Despite his considerable wealth, he pays his workers poorly, and it is often hinted that he once employed slave labour in Africa. *Captain The Honourable Edward \\"Teddy\\" Meldrum (Michael Knowles) - Teddy is Lord Meldrum's younger brother. Little is known about his past life apart from he tried to seduce the 16-year-old dormitory maid at Eton, when he was 19. During the First World War, he had been conscripted as a Captain into the British Army and had served in the Infantry on the Western Front. On September 16, 1918, Teddy fought in the Battle of Amiens, where, whilst leading his men forward was wounded by getting shot in the head by a piece of shrapnel fired from a heavy gun (referred to by everybody as a \\"bonk on the head\\"). Teddy was knocked unconscious and fell into a shell hole. Later he was discovered by and carried back to a nearby Hospital by Alf and James. By 1927 the Honourable Teddy is still unmarried and living in his brother's house. Due to the head wounds that he sustained in the war, he has a lust for servant girls, has had relationships with 5 previous maids (Maggie, Amy, Bella, Violet and Ethel) and has fathered children to them all (6 in all, the last one had twins!): he cannot resist their \\"shiny, scrubbed faces\\" and \\"scent of carbolic soap\\". After Ivy starts working in the house, he is also smitten by her, though she frequently resists. He is being forced by his brother to marry Madge Cartwright, the heiress to a soap dynasty, although is more interested in her maid, Rose. When Poppy elopes to Gretna Green to marry Dickie Metcalfe, Teddy takes the idea and elopes with Rose with the same intention, but this fails. Teddy eventually does marry Rose and raises a family with her. Following the loss of the family fortune, Teddy becomes a successful car salesman. He often says 'bally cheek!' and 'oh hang!'. *Cecily \\"Cissy\\" Meldrum (Catherine Rabett) - Cissy is Lord Meldrum's elder daughter. Although attractive, she dresses in a masculine style, takes part in men's sports and activities, such as flying (she is a qualified pilot), and her feminine \\"chum\\" Penelope is a frequent house guest. Thus, although never explicitly stated, there are many suggestions that Cissy is a lesbian, the many clues to which are not entirely obvious to her father. Cissy is a pleasant character, who shows genuine concern for the family and servants alike, often giving away feminine items such as dresses and make-up to Ivy (whom she shows an attraction to in early episodes, frequently winking at her). Cissy is also the member of the family who has genuine concern for the servants, making her very popular. She often socialises with her younger sister Poppy, but the two regularly bicker because of their differing attitudes. She proclaims herself a socialist and stands as a candidate for the United Workers Party, winning a seat on the council through Alf's machinations. Cissy eventually takes charge of the ailing Union Jack Rubber Company and forms a workers' co-operative (like they do in Russia) in an attempt to save the business. *Poppy Meldrum (Susie Brann) - Poppy is Lord Meldrum's younger daughter (and by far the less grown-up of the two), born during Queen Victoria's funeral (2 February 1901, meaning she is 26), is a spoiled and unpleasant character who attends 'wild' parties with her friend, Jerry (John D. Collins). She is quite a snob about her position in society, often ready to remind those lower of her position, although at other times she confesses to feeling trapped by her class. Throughout the series, she is attracted to the footman, James Twelvetrees, whom she delights in leading on, despite being aware of the problems it could cause for him. She has an on-off relationship with Jerry, who she abandons when she meets Dickie Metcalfe, who is in fact a confidence trickster and is after her money. When George refuses to allow her to marry Metcalfe, she elopes with him to Scotland, but they are intercepted by the family and the servants after Lady Agatha reveals who Metcalfe really is. She eventually agrees to marry Jerry only after the family lose their fortune as she realises she will have to down-grade her lifestyle if she doesn't. *Lady Lavender Southwick (Mavis Pugh) – Lady Lavender is Lord Meldrum's mother-in-law and she resides with her parrot, Captain, in the second bedroom of the house. She is very wealthy and has interests in many businesses including a large number of shares in the Union Jack Rubber Company. Lavender was born into an aristocratic family in the early 1850s, we are given to understand that she led a somewhat promiscuous youth, having many affairs, including with Boris the Crown Prince (later King) of Dalmatia (Davy Kaye). She then became involved with a young army officer called Captain Cedric Dolby (Maurice Denham), the two later became engaged, but separated shortly before he was sent off to fight in the Zulu war. After the death of her husband, Lord Southwick, Lady Lavender moved in with her daughter and son-in-law, becoming increasingly reclusive and senile, and enjoyed throwing plates of food at Ivy. Lavender had a habit of calling the staff different names. Ivy would be called \\"Ethel\\", Alf would be called \\"Capes\\" and Henry would be called \\"Steven\\". Lavender was very genourous to the servants, giving them a suitcase with £10,000 in it, the family jewels, business company shares, and her bed. In the end it was Lavender who saved the Union Jack Rubber Company from collapse by selling her jewels and signing it over to Cissy. Servants *Alf Stokes (Paul Shane) Butler - Alf Stokes is the scheming Butler of the series. Alf is Ivy's father and is still married to Ivy's mother, despite their separation. Alf was a Private in the British Army on the Western Front, along with James Twelvetrees. After coming across the Honourable Teddy unconscious in a shell hole, Alf, believing him to be dead, attempted to mug him, much to James' disgust. After realising Teddy was alive, Alf decided to carry the wounded Teddy back to the field hospital as a way of saving his own life. This act secures Alf the job as Butler nine years later at Lord Meldrum's house, after being forced to return to service after a failed career in showbiz. Alf and Ivy clearly and deeply love each other. Throughout the series, Alf devises a number of schemes to scam Lord Meldrum out of his money and possessions, although these usually fail. This dishonest aspect of his character was often an asset to Lord Meldrum; on a number of occasions Alf was required to create diversions for Sir Ralph. Alf also has a relationship with Mrs Lipton through the series, although it is revealed he did this just to borrow money from her. After the Meldrums' decline, Alf returned to showbiz, together (though just temporarily) with his daughter, Ivy. *James Twelvetrees (Jeffrey Holland) Footman - Stern, upright, and often described by Alf Stokes as \\"pompous and po-faced\\", James Twelvetrees is the complete opposite of Alf. His act of helping Alf carry the wounded Honourable Teddy to hospital during the war secured him a job in the Meldrum household, although he would never admit this to the other servants, and by 1927 he has been with them for nine years. He has a tendency to snobbishness, frequently siding with the gentry instead of his own class and can be harsh towards anyone that he considers socially inferior to him, particularly Mabel and Henry; in spite of this, his devout Christian upbringing has left him with a keen sense of right and wrong, leading him to loan Mabel £1 to pay her rent when he realises that she is in danger of being evicted, and his embarrassment at having a burglar for a father leads him to claim that his father is - instead - a preacher. James' infatuation with Poppy Meldrum, and her manipulative habit of leading him on before reprimanding him for over-familiarity, left him contemplating resignation at times. He is shown to be desired both by aristocratic ladies (including Lady Agatha Shawcross) and housemaid Ivy; although he does not reciprocate Ivy's feelings, he does demonstrate a protective, guiding attitude towards her. After the Meldrums' financial losses, James (and most of the other staff) lose their jobs, but he uses his savings of around £227 17s. 9d. (according to Alf's stealthy browse through James' Post Office savings book) to rent a boarding house on the coast, and hires Ivy as his partner to run it. *Ivy Teasdale (Su Pollard) Maid - Ivy is the well-meaning but rather naive maid, the daughter of Alf. Her father secured her the job as maid after he was appointed as Butler, by forging her references. Ivy was born in Rotherham, 1902 (meaning she is 25). Her familial relationship with Alf is largely a secret, but she is forced to tell Henry when he spots the two alone in her bedroom, and later tells James when she needs his help to get Alf out of trouble. Despite her honesty, she is often persuaded to take part in her father's schemes. In the series, she has to avoid the advances of the Honourable Teddy, whilst also trying to attract the attention of James, who does not reciprocate her affection. She provokes various feelings in the Meldrum household; Poppy's jealousy of her friendship with James leads her to loan Ivy a dress for a party, only to spoil it by \\"accidentally\\" spilling wine over it, whereas Cissy treats Ivy more equally (and, judging by a conversation with her \\"chum\\" Penelope, initially seems to find her physically attractive), and because she is often fooled by the \\"eccentric old lady\\" persona, Ivy frequently finds herself used as target practice whenever Lady Lavender gets a sudden urge to throw unwanted plates of food across the room. After losing her job due to the Meldrums' financial problems, she joins a seaside variety act with her father, but later she decides to start a new life as James' partner in his boarding house. *Blanche Lipton (later Blanche Wilson) (Brenda Cowling) Cook - Blanche Lipton joined the Meldrum household as a young housemaid in her teens and gradually rose through the ranks to become cook; although unmarried, she is given the usual cook's title of \\"Mrs.\\" and her culinary skills are legendary. Mrs Lipton is rarely seen out of the kitchen. By 1927, she had worked for the Meldrum family for forty years. Although a kindly woman who shows sympathy for her betters and equals, Mrs. Lipton is particularly scathing towards those she considers inferior, such as Henry and Mabel. At the start of the series, she develops a relationship with Alf Stokes, willingly lending him money because she believes that he needs it to fund a divorce (although Ivy's allusion to the fact that Alf and her mother don't have a photograph from their wedding day implies that he may not be married at all) and baking huge quantities of cakes for an \\"orphanage\\" (in reality, Alf had spotted an opportunity to sell baked goods to a short-staffed tea room). Alf further deceives Blanche by enlisting an actress friend, Myrtle, to pose as an unwilling-to-divorce Mrs. Stokes; when an angry and frustrated Blanche unleashes her fury by throwing an entire dinner service at Alf, he manipulates her into thinking that he convinced Lord Meldrum not to sack her by paying for the damage, effectively clearing his debt to her. (In reality, Lord Meldrum had not been concerned about the incident and was persuaded to overlook it thanks to a kind word from the Honourable Teddy.) Mrs. Lipton later shifts her affections to PC Wilson, and when he reaches retirement age, they marry and move to his countryside cottage. *Henry Livingstone (Perry Benson) Bootboy - Henry was born in 1909 (meaning he is 18) and was abandoned as a child in a basket on the steps of the Livingstone Road Orphanage, in which institution he remained until the age of 17, when he was taken into the Meldrum house as bootboy. Although the second lowest ranking servant in the house, Henry is often the most insightful, clever and talented character; he can play the piano and bugle and listens to the radio, but his habit of voicing his observations on whatever situation is unfolding is often seen as inappropriate, earning him a clip around the ear from whoever is closest. Henry is in love with Ivy and wants a relationship with her. Following the Meldrum's financial troubles, he becomes the joint Butler/Footman/Bootboy after Alf and James are sacked. *Mabel Wheeler (Barbara New) Charwoman - Mabel is the lowest ranking servant in the Meldrum household. She does not live at the Meldrum house and resides with her disabled, unemployed \\"old man who's flat on his back and can't do a hand's turn\\", in a poor part of London. She is regarded by some of the others as an outsider, James and Mrs Lipton in particular. Because of her low rank and social status, she is not allowed to have meals with the other servants, and is usually given some scraps to take home, which gave rise to her catchphrases \\"That'll be nice(!)\\" and \\"I can't remember the last time I had a...\\". Mabel was also usually not considered to be a house servant who could attend activities, such as church, prayers, and Mrs Lipton's wedding. Once Mabel stated that she believed she was looked down upon by the other servants because she was a \\"casual worker\\" and not a member of the live-in staff. Once Lord Meldrum decided to take the servants on a staff picnic and Mabel wondered if she could join in. James and Mrs Lipton stated Mabel was taking liberties and insinuated she was rubbish. Ivy was incensed by this and openly berated Mrs Lipton for the poor treatment of Mabel, which led to her being able to go. On another occasion, Mabel was invited by Alf to come to a servants' ball, just so she could go. When Mrs Lipton went on strike, Alf took the opportunity to treat Mabel by serving her thick slices of roast ham. When Lord Meldrum invites his workers for dinner and orders fish and chips to put them at ease, Mrs. Lipton's disdain for the aroma of the leftovers makes her only too glad to let Mabel take them home. Following the Meldrum's financial troubles Mabel effectively becomes a maid- of-all-work, with a talent for making lumpy custard. Other characters *Police Constable Wilson (Bill Pertwee) - PC Wilson was the local Bobby, although rarely appeared to be doing his duty. Instead he dined nightly with the servants, as was apparently the custom because the police would then overlook any indiscretion made by the family. He was generally ineffective as a policeman, although had become something of a wine connoisseur, due to his nightly selection from Lord Meldrum's cellar. He later married Mrs Lipton and the couple retired on his police pension. *Sir Ralph Shawcross (John Horsley) - Sir Ralph is another wealthy member of London society, he has two residences; a London house and a country residence. He is married to Lady Agatha (her third husband) and is initially suspicious of Lord Meldrum's relationship with his wife, but eventually comes to regard him as a friend after he is led to believe that Meldrum is impotent and therefore not a threat. When the truth is revealed, he tries to kill Meldrum by cutting the brake pipes on his car and hunting him in the woods with a shotgun. He then turns to the black-arts to curse the House of Meldrum, which he believes has succeeded after the Meldrums lose their fortune. *Lady Agatha Shawcross (Angela Scoular) - Lady Agatha is the wife of Sir Ralph and is also Lord Meldrum's mistress. Lady Agatha is 20 years younger than Sir Ralph, and 17 years younger than George. She conducts her affair with Lord Meldrum even when her husband is present in the house by secretly giving him sleeping pills. She had previously been assistant matron at Eton but had been sacked following an incident with a number of students. She had two previous husbands before she married Sir Ralph, but it is also implied that she has plenty of lovers, who she entertains at her mews apartment. It is strongly hinted that she once had an affair with Dickie Metcalf, Poppy's fiancé. She blatantly shows affection towards Lord Meldrum's footman, James Twelvetrees. She once hinted that she would like to have an affair with Teddy, stating that she finds him attractive and hypothetically suggests dressing up as a servant girl to fulfil his sexual preference. She breaks off her affair with Lord Meldrum after he loses his money when his business declines. *Madge Cartwright (Yvonne Marsh) - The sole heiress to the Cartwright Soap business empire, she resides in a luxury flat in Mayfair and is a regular visitor to the house. On one occasion, Teddy comments that Madge was a society debutante in 1903, suggesting that she is in her early-to-mid forties. She is a longtime admirer of Teddy, and the two become engaged. She does not realise that Teddy secretly despises her, and only proposed to her because George threatened to deport him if he didn't. She chases Teddy north when he tries to elope with Rose at the same time Poppy elopes with Dickie Metcalf. She initially forgives Teddy for this act, but later breaks off their engagement after Teddy is honest about what he thinks of her, and tells her of his intention to marry Rose. *Charles, the Lord Bishop (Frank Williams) - Charles is the Lord Bishop, and a close friend of the family. He is a frequent visitor at the Meldrum house, often accompanied by his young chaplain, Robin (Robbie Barnett). He usually visits when he wants money, whether it be for his home for distressed gentlewomen, or items for his charity auction. He also takes the Sunday services at the local church, which the family and the servants attend. He remains a good friend even after the financial losses of Lord Meldrum. *Jerry (John D. Collins) - Jerry is the longtime boyfriend of Poppy Meldrum, generally silly and given to heavy drinking. The morning after parties and nights out, he is often found unconscious by the servants in various places in the house, such as behind the harmonium or under the dining room table. He is bossed around by Poppy, and is unaware of her attraction to the footman, James Twelvetrees. He also seems to be unaffected by her brief relationship with Dickie Metcalf and the fact that she tried to run away and marry him. He eventually marries Poppy after the Meldrums lose their fortune. *Rose (Amanda Bellamy) - Rose was Madge Cartwright's housemaid, who was pursued by Teddy. Unlike all the other maids Teddy chased, Rose reciprocated the attraction, and eloped with him to Gretna Green to get married. This attempt failed, however, as they were caught up by Madge Cartwright and the Meldrum family. Following this incident, Madge sacked Rose, and Alf secured her a job in another household. However, this did not stop her from seeing Teddy. Finally, Teddy broke off his engagement to Madge and married her, thus making her a rich aristocrat. By 1928, Rose was expecting their first child. *Selfridge (Hugh Lloyd) - Selfridge was Sir Ralph Shawcross's butler. He was an alcoholic who regularly stole wine from Sir Ralph's cellar. He was sacked from his position after he was caught, and Sir Ralph offered his job to James Twelvetrees. However Selfridge was reinstated after Miss Poppy (who didn't want James to leave) blackmailed Lady Agatha into forcing Sir Ralph to withdraw the offer. Selfridge was later sacked again, but not before revealing to Sir Ralph that Lady Agatha was having an affair with Lord Meldrum. *Mr Pearson (Felix Bowness) - A delivery driver for Teetgen's (the grocery suppliers), who brought the Meldrum household their weekly groceries and collected their payment. His delivery van was once commandeered by PC Wilson to chase Dickie Metcalf, who was eloping with Miss Poppy in a stolen car. *Miss Potter (Judith Fellows) - The owner of the Sunshine Pantry tearooms, who bought Mrs Lipton's cakes from Alf, believing they were from a high-class confectionery firm. She was forced to do this after her partner left her and she was struggling to keep the business going by herself. *Hortence Anstruther (Angela Easterling) - A colleague of Cissy Meldrum's from the United Workers Party. She ran the soup kitchen and was a strict vegetarian. *Penelope Barrington-Blake (Sorel Johnson) - A friend of Cissy Meldrum's - strongly implied to be her girlfriend, although unlike Cissy, she dresses in a very feminine style. She is once caught in bed with Cissy by Ivy after they return home in the early hours. She frequently goes out on the town with Cissy, Poppy and Jerry and subsequently stays the night. It is revealed that her father made his fortune from paint. *Dickie Metcalf (Robin Lermitte) - A confidence trickster and thief, who was cashiered from the Guards for cheating at cards, he pretends to be the scion of a tea plantation owner in Ceylon and writes dud cheques - it is strongly implied that he once had an affair with Lady Agatha and was subsequently blackmailing her. He then became involved with Poppy Meldrum and eloped with her to Gretna Green in a stolen car. The couple were being pursued by the Meldrum family, their servants and PC Wilson, who caught up with them at Watford Gap and prevented the marriage. Dickie was last seen flying off in Cissy's plane, which he had just stolen. =The Union Jack Rubber Company= *Mr Foster (Michael Lees) - Mr Foster is the factory Manager. He is disliked by most of the workforce, who do not like the way he sucks up to Lord Meldrum. He attended a dinner party which Lord Meldrum threw for his workers, and worked with Cissy to save the factory when it started to decline. *Mr Barnes (Ivor Roberts) - Mr Barnes is the foreman. He has worked in rubber for 35 years, and is consequently an expert. He also attended the workers' dinner party. When the factory was threatened with closure, he conspired with Alf Stokes and Jock MacGregor to burn down their main rivals' factory, the Acme Rubber and Latex Company, although this was never actually carried out. *Jock MacGregor (Stuart McGugan) - The Scottish shop-steward (and the Union leader), often portrayed as a class warrior, or at least a left-wing agitator. He works in the factory testing department and is scathing of the Meldrums, as he sees that it is his hard work and labour that have given them their fortune. He attended the workers' dinner party, and was attracted to Miss Poppy. He was highly supportive of Alf's plan to burn down the Acme Rubber and Latex Company to put their main rival out of business. Non-speaking and unseen characters *Captain - Captain was Lady Lavender's pet parrot. He had apparently fought in the Indian Mutiny, Siege of Lucknow, Anglo-Zulu War, and WW1. Whenever Ivy knocked on Lavender's door, Captain would say \\"Come in\\", then Lavender would say \\"oh shut up come in\\", then Captain would copy her. Once after Lavender had given Union Jack Rubber Company shares to Ivy, Alf, and Henry, she gave them all to Captain, who in turn ate them all up except the seal. Captain would also say \\"pieces of eight\\". Captain was once met a female parrot, bought by Lavender from Harrods, and they were married by Constable Wilson. However, it turned out that the other parrot was male, as well. Lavender then lifted up the cage blanket (unseen to the audience) and said \\"well they seem to be managing all right,\\" implying that Captain was homosexual. It was later revealed that Lavender thought the other parrot was boring (because he never said anything) so she sent him back to Harrods. Lavender once considered leaving Captain all her money. In one of the later episodes, Captain became ill and died. Lavender gave him a military funeral in the pet cemetery, which required George, Teddy, Alf and James to wear their military uniforms, and ordered PC Wilson to do the sermon (as he did at the wedding). Lavender also put valuable jewellery in the coffin, that was later dug up by Wilson. Lavender made a sculpture, tombstone, and poem for Captain, and mentioned him in the next four episodes. *Lady Meldrum (née Southwick) - Lady Meldrum was the wife of George, the mother of Cissy and Poppy, and the daughter of Lady Lavender. Not much is known about her, although she assisted James in arranging the house flowers. It is unknown if George was having his affair with Lady Agatha while she was still alive. She was never seen on-screen. Early in the series, Cissy alludes to the fact that her mother has been dead for three years, suggesting that Lady Meldrum died in about 1924. *Lord Southwick - Lord Southwick was the husband of Lady Lavender. He was married to her in 1879. It is unknown if he knew of her affairs. Not much is known about him, as he is never seen on-screen. According to her, he drowned in the Bosphorus. His death made Lavender move in with her daughter's family, the Meldrums.

He was born in Toledo, Spain and probably died in Jerusalem. He was the uncle and teacher of Rabbi Joseph Karo, author of the Shulchan Aruch. Biography Rabbi Karo studied under Rabbi Isaac Canpanton in Toledo. Eventually, he moved to Lisbon in order to establish his own Yeshiva. As a Spanish Jew, he was forcibly exiled from his homeland Spain after the signing of the Alhambra Decree in 1492 which expelled all Jews from the joint kingdom of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon. From Spain he immigrated to nearby Portugal, only to be expelled with the Jews of Portugal. While en route to Turkey all but one of his sons died. Although the details of Rabbi Karo's life afterwards are unclear, it is apparent that he lived Istanbul in Turkey. In the year 1517, he completed his magnum opus, Toldot Yitzchak. In that year, he set out to Israel, but it is unclear whether he eventually reached Israel or did not. Some scholars write that he moved at this time to Damascus.

Early life and education Born in Angleton, Texas, Terry graduated from Angleton High School and played college basketball at St. Edward's University in Austin. Terry graduated from St. Edward's in 1990 with a bachelor's degree in business administration with a minor in physical education. Coaching career Terry began his coaching career as an assistant coach at St. Edward's in the 1990–91 season. Then, Terry became an assistant at James Bowie High School also in Austin, where he would remain from 1991 to 1993. After his stint at Bowie, Terry became a head coach for the first time at Somerville High School in Somerville, Texas. In his two seasons at Somerville (1993 to 1995), Terry went 49–21 and led Somerville to the Class 2A semifinals in 1994. Terry returned to Angleton High School to be head coach in the 1995–96 season, during which he had a 15–13 record for a cumulative 64–34 high school coaching record. In 1996, Terry moved up to the major college level as an assistant at Baylor under Harry Miller. After two years at Baylor, Terry joined the staff of Jerry Wainwright as assistant coach at UNCW. During a stint that lasted from 1998 to 2002, Terry helped UNCW make the 2000 and 2002 NCAA Tournaments by way of winning the CAA Tournaments. As a #13 seed in 2002, UNCW upset #4 seed USC in the first round for the first NCAA Tournament win in program history. On June 11, 2002, Terry joined Texas as an assistant coach under Rick Barnes. At Texas, Terry helped recruit McDonald's All-American players like Kevin Durant, D. J. Augustin, and Tristan Thompson. Texas also made NCAA Tournament runs to the Final Four in 2003 and to the Elite Eight in 2006 and 2008. Terry replaced Steve Cleveland as head coach at Fresno State on April 7, 2011. Fresno State went 13–20 (3–11 Western Athletic Conference) in Terry's first season in 2011–12. The following season in 2012–13, Fresno State moved to the Mountain West Conference (MW) and went 11–19. Fresno State went 21–18 and made the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) in 2013–14 for the program's first 20-win season and postseason appearance since the 2006–07 season. Despite a 1–7 start, Fresno State finished 9–9 in MW play, an unprecedented finish in conference history. Fresno State lost the CBI in three games to Siena. In June 2014, Fresno State extended Terry's contract through 2017. Despite a 15–17 record in 2014–15, Fresno State improved to 10–8 in MW play and beat four teams that made that year's NCAA Tournament: Boise State, San Diego State, UC Irvine, and Wyoming. On January 3, 2015, Fresno State beat #25 San Diego State for its first win over a ranked opponent since 2002. Terry led Fresno State to a 25–10 record, MW Tournament title, and NCAA Tournament auto-bid in the 2015–16 season. A #14 seed, Fresno State lost to #3 seed Utah in the first round 80-69. Following a three-year extension and nearly $50,000 annual raise in January 2016, Fresno State extended Terry through the 2020–21 season in December 2016. On March 12, 2018, Terry was named the new head coach of the University of Texas at El Paso men's basketball team. Terry suffered an attack of anaphylactic shock and was hospitalized in late December 2019. He missed a game against Florida International on January 2, 2020, with assistant coach Kenton Paulino taking over for Terry. Terry is expected to make a full recovery. After starting 8-1 to open the 2019-20 season, Terry and the Miners lost 14 out of their last 23 games.

It had the goal of winning the $30 million Google Lunar X Prize, and of ultimately mining the Moon for natural resources of economic value. The company was not able to make a launch attempt to reach the Moon by March 31, 2018, the deadline for the prize. As of February 2020, Moon Express is focused on supporting NASA under its Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. History In August 2010, Robert D. Richards, Naveen Jain, and Barney Pell co-founded Moon Express, a Mountain View, California-based company that plans to offer commercial lunar robotic transportation and data services with a long-term goal of mining the Moon for resources, including elements that are rare on Earth, including niobium, yttrium and dysprosium. Beginning in 2010, Moon Express based itself at the NASA Ames Research Center. Moon Express and NASA signed a contract in October 2010https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/oct/HQ_10-259_ILDD_Award.html for data purchase that could be worth up to . On June 30, 2011, the company held its first successful test flight of a prototype lunar lander system called the Lander Test Vehicle (LTV) that was developed in partnership with NASA. On September 11, 2011, Moon Express set up a robotics lab for a lunar probe named the \\"Moon Express Robotics Lab for INnovation\\" (MERLIN) and hired several engineering students who had successfully competed at the FIRST Robotics Competition. In mid-2012, Moon Express started work with the International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) to put a shoebox-sized astronomical telescope called International Lunar Observatory on the Moon. By 2012, MoonEx had 20 employees, and in December 2012, MoonEx acquired one of the other Google Lunar X-Prize teams, Rocket City Space Pioneers, from Dynetics for an undisclosed sum. The agreement made Tim Pickens, the former lead of the RCSP team, the Chief Propulsion Engineer for MoonEx. In September 2013, MoonEx added Paul Spudis as Chief Scientist and Jack Burns as Science Advisory Board Chair. In October and November 2013, Moon Express conducted several free flight tests of its flight software utilizing the NASA Mighty Eagle lander test vehicle, under a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. One month later, in December 2013, MoonEx unveiled the MX-1 lunar lander, a toroidal robotic lander that uses high-test hydrogen peroxide as its rocket propellant to support vertical landing on the lunar surface. On April 30, 2014 NASA announced that Moon Express was one of the three companies selected for the Lunar CATALYST initiative. By December 2014, Moon Express successfully conducted flight tests of its \\"MTV-1X\\" lander test vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility, becoming the first private company (and GLXP team) to demonstrate a commercial lunar lander test. In 2015, the company announced that it would relocate to Florida's Cape Canaveral in 2015. In July 2016, Moon Express stated it would be taking over Cape Canaveral Launch Complexes 17 and 18. On July 20, 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration approved Moon Express plans for a mission to deliver commercial payloads to the Moon, making Moon Express the first private company to receive government approval for a commercial space mission beyond traditional Earth orbit under the requirements of the Outer Space Treaty. On October 31, 2017, NASA extended the agreement for the Lunar CATALYST initiative for 2 more years. On July 12, 2018, both historic launch towers at Space Launch Complex 17 were demolished via controlled demolition to make way for Moon Express facilities to test its lunar lander. That month, Moon Express was unable to make payroll and laid off nine employees; the employees did not receive back-pay until October 2018.https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/space/go-for-launch/os-bz-moon- express-update-20181114-story.html In October 2018, the company signed several collaboration agreements with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and a number of Canadian aerospace companies.U.S.-BASED MOON EXPRESS ANNOUNCES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MOON EXPRESS CANADA AND CANADIAN SPACE SECTOR PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE EXPLORATION OF THE MOON.

Career The son of a doctor, Latte studied at the Universities of Königsberg, Bonn and Berlin. After taking his doctorate at Königsberg in 1913 under Ludwig Deubner with a study on cultic dance in ancient Greece, he began work on an edition of the dictionary of Hesychius of Alexandria. After service in World War I he was Assistent at the Institut für Altertumskunde of the University of Münster from 1920 to 1923, gaining his Habilitation there in 1920 with a study of Greek and Roman sacral law. In 1923 he was appointed Professor at Greifswald as successor to Johannes Mewaldts, in 1926 Professor at Basel as successor to Günther Jachmann, and in 1931 Professor at Göttingen, as successor to Eduard Fraenkel. He was forced to retire on April 1, 1936, having been classified as a Jew by the Nazis. Having returned to Germany in 1937 from a visiting professorship in Chicago, Latte lived out the period of Nazi rule in Hamburg (where he was supported by Bruno Snell), Düsseldorf, and Osterode am Harz, where he had been invited by his erstwhile Greifswald colleague Konrat Ziegler, who hid him for a time. In 1945 he was able to resume his chair at Göttingen, but declined to endorse an appointment for Ziegler. In 1947 he was made a corresponding member of the German Academy of Sciences in Berlin. From 1949 to 1956 he was President and Vice President of the Academy of Sciences at Göttingen, as well as chairman of the Mommsen- Gesellschaft. In 1951 he received an honorary doctorate from Heidelberg. After his retirement in 1957 he moved to Tutzing and up until his death held seminars on Greek law at the University of Munich. Scholarly work His major work is Römische Religionsgeschichte (Munich, 1960), which was intended to replace the work of Georg Wissowa that by then was nearly 60 years old. Although widely cited, Latte's work has not escaped criticism. Latte attempted to be systematic and historical at the same time, melding Wissowa's Varro- based systematic description with the historical approach of Franz Altheim; the resulting structure can seem haphazard.Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), p. 3. In the opinion of Stefan Weinstock, Latte's understanding of linguistics was superior to that of Wissowa.As noted by C. Robert Phillips III, \\"Approaching Roman Religion: The Case for Wissenschaftsgeschichte,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 25. Weinstock's essay review of Latte's book appeared in the Journal of Roman Studies 51 (1961) 206–215. Latte rejected animism as having explanatory value for the study of Roman religion, but made some use of the concept of sympathetic magic, an approach criticized as inconsistent.Phillips, \\"Approaching Roman Religion,\\" pp. 24–25. His discussion of Roman priesthoods is considered \\"vital.\\"Christopher Smith, \\"The Religion of Archaic Rome,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 42. Latte viewed Roman religious traditions as in decline in the late Republic, and subject to political abuse.Susanne William Rasmussen, Public Portents in Republican Rome («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2003), p. 32. He felt, however, that the importance of Imperial cult had been exaggerated, and that \\"emperor worship\\" was a minor and perhaps not really a religious phenomenon at all. His is a counterweight to the predominant scholarly view that Imperial cult became increasingly central to Roman religion.As summarized by Allen Brent, The Imperial Cult and the Development of Church Order: Concepts and Images of Authority in Paganism and Early Christianity before the Age of Cyprian (Brill, 1999), pp. xix–xx. Latte's monumental edition of Hesychius of Alexandria was left unfinished at the time of his death (vol. 1 published in 1953, vol. 2 posthumously in 1966); the work was completed by Peter Allan Hansen and Ian C. Cunningham (vols. 3-4, 2005-2009).

Between 1925 and the 1950s, it was the site of early attempts to extract bitumen from the Athabasca oil sands that contributed to the development of commercially viable extraction processes. The site closed permanently in 1958. Some of the structures at Bitumont were declared Provincial Historic Resources in 1974. As of 2017, the buildings are deteriorating. History Work at the site commenced after Robert Cosmas Fitzsimmons incorporated the International Bitumen Company Limited in 1925. Fitzsimmons named the site Bitumount, and by 1930 he had constructed a small oil extraction plant there.Alberta Online Encyclopedia: R.C. Fitzsimmons It was situated on the edge of the Athabasca River, which was the major transportation corridor in the region at that time. The raw oil sand was crushed and heated in hot water, and the oily substance that rose to the surface was skimmed off. The company made its first sale of bitumen in Edmonton in 1930, and the Edmonton Journal announced that \\"those shipments of absolutely pure bitumen are the first and second and only shipments in the history of McMurray tar sands to be made for commercial purposes and it certainly (augurs) well for the future development of the much talked of tar sands of northern Alberta.\\" Fitzsimmons constructed a small upgrader and other facilities at Bitumount in 1937-1938, but oil prices remained low during the Great Depression and International Bitumen became insolvent. In 1943, the company was sold to Oil Sands Limited, which was owned by Lloyd Champion. Champion entered into an agreement with the Alberta provincial government to develop a new, larger-scale separation plant. The new plant was built, but Champion failed to provide his share of the funding. The province became the sole investor and, under the direction of Dr. Karl A. Clark, successful tests of Clark's hot-water process, which was much more efficient that the process used by Fitzsimmons, were completed in 1948/49. After that, the plant operated only intermittently, and it closed permanently in 1958. Interest in the Athabasca oil sands had declined, primarily due to the discovery of conventional petroleum at Leduc in 1947. In 1974, the 1930s plant and the larger 1940s plant at Bitumount were declared Provincial Historic Resources. Today As of 2017, the structures at Bitumount have deteriorated. The 1930s plant has collapsed, although much of the equipment is still in place. The 1940s plant was more substantially built and its steel frame and concrete foundations are still in good condition. Many of the wood buildings, including Fitzgerald's original cabin, are in serious disrepair.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/back-to-bitumount-how- the-oil-sands-changed-alberta-and-canadaforever/article35528769/ See also *History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil) References Further reading *J.

History and definition  Parrish (1993) defined Paracrocodylomorpha as the last common ancestor of \\"Poposauridae\\" and Crocodylomorpha and all of its descendants. He believed that Poposaurus and its allies were among the closest relatives of crocodylomorphs. Therefore, his definition was intended to exclude various groups of heavily-built Triassic pseudosuchians, collectively known as \\"rauisuchians\\". Weinbaum & Hungerbühler (2007) hypothesized that the relations of Pseudosuchians were reversed to those hypothesized by Parrish. They claimed that \\"rauisuchians\\" such as Postosuchus, Batrachotomus, and Saurosuchus were closer to crocodylians than Poposaurus was. They erected a subgroup within Paracrocodylomorpha which they called Paracrocodyliformes. This subgroup contained all pseudosuchians closer to those three \\"rauisuchians\\" (as well as the Nile crocodile) rather than Poposaurus. Nesbitt (2011) introduced the most recent and common definition of Paracrocodylomorpha in his broad phylogenetic analysis. His results supported Weinbaum & Hungerbühler (2007)'s claim that \\"rauisuchians\\" were closer to crocodylians than Poposaurus was. In fact, he found that crocodylomorphs were actually descended from the \\"rauisuchian\\" group, thus rendering \\"Rauisuchia\\" a paraphyletic grade of various reptiles leading to crocodylomorphs. Moreover, the name \\"Paracrocodyliformes\\" used by Weinbaum & Hungerbühler (2007) was assigned a new name, Loricata. Ticinosuchus, the sister taxon to paracrocodylomorphs under Nesbitt (2011)'s methodologies The name \\"Paracrocodylomorpha\\" was re-defined by Nesbitt in his study, reacquiring a name similar to its original usage by Parrish (1993). Nesbitt found that poposauroids formed the sister group to loricatans, and that the clade encompassing poposauroids and loricatans required a new name. Therefore, he used Paracrocodylomorpha to connect Poposaurus and Crocodylus, and all descendants of their common ancestor. Unlike Parrish's vision for the clade, Nesbitt's Paracrocodylomorpha included the \\"rauisuchians\\", which were members of Loricata. The only \\"rauisuchian\\" not found to belong to Paracrocodylomorpha with absolute confidence was the former \\"prestosuchid\\" Ticinosuchus. Nesbitt found that his most parsimonious results indicated that this genus was the sister taxon of the paracrocodylomorphs, rather than an internal component of the group. However, due to its crushed skeleton obscuring crucial anatomical details, it is also conceivable that Ticinosuchus may actually belong inside Paracrocodylomorpha pending new info. This result has already been recovered by Da-Silva et al. (2019), which places Ticinosuchus as the basalmost loricatan while also sometimes having the recently described suchian Mandasuchus lie outside of the group. Description = Unambiguous synapomorphies = Under Nesbitt (2011)'s revised interpretation of the clade's components, only two unambiguous synapomorphies (derived distinguishing traits) were found for Paracrocodylomorpha. The tip of each pubis (forward-pointing hip bone) expands into a structure known as a pubic boot. In addition, metatarsal II (the foot bone which connects to the second- innermost toe) is at least as long if not longer than metatarsal IV (the foot bone which connects to the outermost toe). More basal pseudosuchians such as aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, Gracilisuchus, and Ticinosuchus lack these two traits. = Ambiguous synapomorphies = aetosaurs Various paracrocodylomorphs share a few other derived traits, although it is not entirely clear if these features evolved precisely at the base of Paracrocodylomorpha and thus characterize the group. Some of these traits cannot be proven or disproven to exist in the crushed skeleton of Ticinosuchus. If they are present in Ticinosuchus, they evolved prior to Paracrocodylomorpha, but if not present in that genus, they can also be considered to be synapomorphies for Paracrocodylomorpha. For example, the inner face of the jaw joint possesses a spur that projects downwards and inwards in loricatans and basal poposauroids, although this trait is unknown in Ticinosuchus and lost in advanced poposauroids such as Poposaurus and shuvosaurids. A similar trait is the fact that the ilium (upper hip plate) leans outwards. This forces the acetabulum (hip socket) to face downwards, leading to a 'pillar-erect' hip posture. This posture is well known in loricatans (apart from sprawling crocodylomorphs) and basal poposauroids, but it is also known in aetosaurs. Aetosaurs may have acquired this posture independently, but if not, it cannot be considered a synapomorphy of Paracrocodylomorpha. Advanced poposauroids lack an outward-leaning ilium, but also possess a specialized supraacetabular crest which forces the acetabulum to face downward, resulting in the retention of a 'pillar-erect' posture. Some paracrocodylomorphs also have a pubis which contacts the ischium (rear- pointing hip bone) only slightly compared to earlier pseudosuchians. In poposauroids other than Qianosuchus and Lotosaurus, this trait is exaggerated to the point that the two bones don't even touch each other. Prestosuchus, a basal loricatan likely very similar to the ancestral paracrocodylomorph Various paracrocodylomorphs possess a pit on the snout, between the premaxilla and maxilla bones. This pit, termed a 'subnarial foramen' was found by Nesbitt (2011) to be present only in loricatans at least as derived as Batrachotomus. However, a restudy of Prestosuchus by Da-Silvia et al. (2016) showed that the pit was present in basal loricatans as well as poposauroids. They proposed that a subnarial foramen may have been an additional synapomorphy of Paracrocodylomorpha, although it is unknown in Ticinosuchus. The proximal portion of the femur (thigh bone) in some paracrocodylomorphs also possessed derived features compared to earlier taxa. Like many other archosaurs, the femoral head is tilted about 45 degrees outwards and backwards. The inner/rear face of the head possesses two large bumps (tubera), one more inward than the other. In non-paracrocodylomorph pseudosuchians, the more outward/rearward one (the posteromedial tuber) is larger, but in poposauroids and most loricatans, they are equal in size. However, Prestosuchus, one of the most basal loricatans, had a larger posteromedial tuber. Nevertheless, even more basal loricatans such as Mandasuchus had tubera of equal sizes, indicating that the situation in Prestosuchus was an anomaly. The femoral head may also have possessed a straight groove on its upper side in the earliest paracrocodylomorphs. This final trait is known in poposauroids and a few loricatans more basal than Fasolasuchus, but it is also unknown in Ticinosuchus and present in Nundasuchus so it may have predated Paracrocodylomorpha. Phylogeny According to Parrish (1993), this clade was nested within Rauisuchia, a group of crurotarsans that once included only extinct Triassic forms but is now generally regarded as paraphyletic. Rauisuchia traditionally included the families Rauisuchidae and Poposauridae to the exclusion of Crocodylomorpha, but Parrish found Poposauridae more closely related to Crocodylomorpha than to Rauisuchidae. This close relationship was recognized since the 1980s. The genus Gracilisuchus was also found to be a close relative of crocodylomorphs and poposaurids but was not placed within Paracrocodylomorpha. Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic relationships in Parrish's 1993 study: However, more recent analyses have doubted the idea that poposaurids (and by extension other poposauroids) were grouped with crocodylians to the exception of other groups. For example, a 2007 phylogenetic study by Weinbaum & Hungerbühler, found the rauisuchian families Rauisuchidae and Prestosuchidae to be more closely related to Crocodylomorpha than was Poposauridae. The authors erected the clade Paracrocodyliformes for the clade including Rauisuchidae, Prestosuchidae, and Crocodylomorpha. In addition, several putative poposaurids such as Postosuchus and Teratosaurus were found to be rauisuchids. Sterling J. Nesbitt in 2011 found a similar topology, including Rauisuchidae and \\"Prestosuchidae\\" ( the latter of which he found to be polyphyletic) within Paracrocodylomorpha. The closest relative of Paracrocodylmorpha to not qualify as a member of the clade is Ticinosuchus, a large predator once considered to qualify as a prestosuchid. The composition of Paracrocodylomorpha generally follows the analysis of Nesbitt (2011) in other recent studies.

Plot summary Clark & McCullough, as Hives and Blodgett, are campaign managers for political candidate Oliver Beezley. They plan to defeat Beezley's political rival, Commodore Amos Pipp (James Finlayson), by exploiting his weakness for women. Blodgett is to be disguised as a beautiful woman to entrap Pipp, but with his moustache he proves unconvincing in drag—Hives declares, \\"Even the Commodore wouldn't fall for a buzzard like you!\\"—and Hives instead enlists the help of Mrs. Beezley (Dorothy Granger) to carry out the scheme. First, though, they have to stay out of the line of fire, and ahead of the police, the nearsighted house detective (Monte Collins), a sleepy man with a cot (Charles Williams), and a somnambulist Countess (Sandra Shaw) with her afghan hound.

Gameplay In the game, the player participates in the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing and Navigation Competition at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. Aircrews from around the world come here to compete against each other, undertaking three missions which are monitored and points are awarded. The best aircrew then receives the Curtis E. LeMay Trophy. The player can choose between six different planes. After having selected the aircraft the player has to select a mission, and then appropriate weaponry for the selected mission from an array of weapons consisting of different types of missiles and bombs. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1990 approved of the large variety of aircraft and the scenario editor, but criticized the graphics as inferior to that of competitors such as A-10 Tank Killer, and claiming to support sound card audio when only a few portions of music did so. The magazine concluded that \\"Strike Aces is not a bad product; it simply did not live up to its potential in execution\\". 1992 and 1994 surveys in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game two and a half stars out of five.

The category 2 hut lies on the west summit of the Zugspitze at a height of 2,959 metressee topographic map 1:25,000 series, sheet 8531/8631 \\"Zugspitze\\" by the Bavarian State Survey Office and is thus the highest refuge hut in the German Alps. The Münchner Haus is managed by Hansjörg Barth whose family have run the hut for three generations since 1925.  Approach routes  The hut may be reached with the aid of cable cars from the Zugspitzplatt, the Eibsee lake and from Ehrwald in Austria. The Münchner Haus is accessible on foot over the usual climbing paths to the Zugspitze.  Tour options  Due to the exposed situation of the summit, walkers have a very limited scope. In addition to the approach routes to the summit of the Zugspitze which are suitable for walkers in places, there is the short, slightly exposed climbing path to the actual summit cross on the east summit. For ambitious climbers the Jubilee Ridge, which runs between the Zugspitze and the Alpspitze, offers an interesting climbing tour.  Facilities  There are usually shower facilities available at the hut. For 4 € they supply 30 litres of warm or cold water. It is not possible to reserve bedspaces at weekends, and during the week reservations are unnecessary. From 3 pm beds are allocated every hour on the hour. In 2019, as part of its ongoing fight against the spread of bed bugs in some German alpine huts, the Münchner Haus required those staying at the hut to microwave their sleeping bags in advance.  History  The foundation stone for the Münchner Haus was laid in 1894. Construction was very controversial and led to a rift within the Munich Section of the German Alpine Club, the outcome of which was the foundation of the Bayerland Section. Three years later the Alpine Club celebrated the opening of the hut on 19 September 1897. On 19 July 1900 the meteorological station with its prominent tower was inaugurated. The first meteorologist on the Zugspitze was Josef Enzensperger, who was the first to winter alone in 1900/1901.

The treaty was followed by several other agreements. Background Coin of Andronikos III. In the beginning of 1327 Bulgaria became involved in the third and final stage of the Byzantine civil war of 1321–1328 between Andronikos II and his grandson Andronikos III.Andreev, p. 258 Despite the inconsistent Serbian policy in his assistance, the old emperor managed to negotiate the support of the Serbian king Stephen Dečanski which urged Andronikos III to tighten his relations with the Emperor of Bulgaria.Fine, pp. 270-271 Michael Shishman, who fought against Andronikos III three years earlier, was interested to help because he was in strained relations with Serbia after his divorce with Anna Neda and was disturbed by the marriage of Stephen Dečanski to the cousin of the old emperor Maria Palaiologina.Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, p. 565Fine, p. 270 Treaty Michael Shishman and Andronikos III met at Chernomen on the Byzantine–Bulgarian border in May 1327. Since the negotiations were supposed to be secret, they used for pretext the desire of the Byzantine empress Rita of Armenia to meet her daughter Maria Palaiologina, whom she had not seen for 23 years and Andronikos III was allegedly anxious to see his sister as well.Andreev, p. 259 John Kantakouzenos, who was present during the negotiations, intentionally concealed their real purpose and described them as a private meeting between relatives and only writes about eight days of rejoicing and feasts.Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, p. 566GIBI, p. 235 However, during these eight days the emperors met several times in private or officially with their delegations. Eventually they reached an agreement for mutual help against their enemies. Michael Shishman had to provide assistance against Andronikos II, while the young emperor was obliged to help Michael Shishman against the King of Serbia. It was also agreed that in case Andronikos III became sole emperor, he was to cede to Bulgaria several border territories and a large amount of money as dowry. The treaty was signed without major obstacles as both sides had clear interest of the alliance — Michael Shishman wanted a reconquest of Macedonia, while Andronikos III was preparing for the final confrontation with his grandfather. Aftermath Backed on the treaty, when hostilities were resumed in the autumn of 1327, Andronikos III was able to quickly submit Macedonia and in January 1328 captured Salonika, the second most important city in the Byzantine Empire.Fine, p. 252 Surprised by the quick victory of his ally, Michael Shishman offered help to Andronikos II in return of the surrender of all border lands and money. He sent 3,000 horsemen under the command of Ivan the Russian to guard him, but his real intention was to capture the old emperor and Constantinople. After the interference of Andronikos III, however, the plot failed and the Bulgarian detachment returned home.Andreev, pp. 256-260GIBI, pp. 255-259 After several showdown campaigns without field battles and mutual accusations for not respecting the Treaty of Chernomen, Michael Shishman and Andronikos III renegotiated peace in October 1328. The Bulgarians agreed not to take territory and were awarded large amount of money.Andreev, p. 261Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, pp. 567-568 As the relations between Bulgaria and Serbia were deteriorating and the two countries were on the course of war, Michael Shishman and Andronikos III organised a final meeting at Krimni between Sozopol and Anchialos in the beginning of 1329 and agreed to a \\"lasting peace and eternal alliance\\".Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, p. 568 They agreed to attack Serbia, but the Bulgarian army was defeated in the Battle of Velbazhd on 28 July 1330 and Michael Shishman was mortally

Erich Kahler, a scholar, author, and lecturer, arrived in Princeton in 1939 as a financially destitute Jewish refugee from the Nazi regime. One Evelyn Place welcomed Jewish intellectual refugees from Europe and was filled with visitors, boarders, and cultural conversation. The Einstein family, Thomas Mann's family, and Hermann Broch were close friends of the Kahlers. The Kahler circle of friends also included Erwin Panofsky, Hetty Goldman, Ernst Kantorowicz, Kurt Gödel, and the painter Ben Shahn.

Ethnobotanical importance This plant is known as an important medicinal plant in the herb industry in Indonesia, using mainly the seed. In addition, other parts which considered medicinal are the bark, leaves and the root. It is most sought after for its anti-bacterial properties and is applied in traditional medicine for infections and stomach disorders. Some states in the North-East India like Mizoram (where it's called 'Zawngtah'), Manipur (where it's called 'Yongchak'), etc. use its fruit (the bean-liked part) as part of their meal. This bean after having its skin scraped off is eaten raw or cooked by the Mizo and other hill people of north-east India.

Early history The Streissguth Gardens have grown incrementally over the years, beginning with Daniel Streissguth’s purchase of the north lot by the Blaine steps in 1962. In 1965, Ann moved into the adjacent house at 1806 Broadway East and began cultivating a garden there. The two gardens were joined when Daniel and Ann married in 1968, and the combined gardens form the basis for the larger family garden that exists today. Expansion In 1972, two years after Ben was born, the family purchased the hillside lots south of the Blaine steps. The first path was cleared in order to admire a native trillium discovered blooming among the weeds in the middle of the hillside. Further paths were developed to allow better access for planting and maintenance as more of the hillside was cultivated, and Ben and his friends, as well as other neighbors, began enjoying the growing network of trails. The oldest trail was named the Woodland Path, followed by the High Path, the Rock Wall Path, and the Raccoon Pool Path. Over time, the tree canopy has been thinned to allow for better views of Lake Union from the various paths and higher points in the garden. Special sections From north to south, the gardens are divided into four main sections, beginning with the perennial/shrub section that borders the public steps and walkway on East Blaine Street. Second is the central section, extending from the hillside trails to the east to the edge of Broadway East, to the west. This main section includes perennials and fruit-bearing shrub plantings, as well as berries and vegetable beds. Third, the Rust Garden, which has the best soil and sunlight, has been cultivated for perennials. Finally, the transition zone between the developed gardens and the St. Mark's Greenbelt is experiencing a blurring of boundaries to facilitate better public access and enjoyment of the gardens. The public gardens The garden was first threatened with encroaching construction in the late 1970s, when the wooded lots at the south end of Broadway East were proved viable for a condo development project. The neighborhood rallied together and succeeded in protecting the lots. When in 1989 the city of Seattle passed a bond to purchase and preserve undeveloped green space, the neighborhood nominated the garden’s south lots for purchase. After negotiations with the city, this was finally achieved in 1996 and the south lots of the Streissguth Gardens became public land, and part of the St. Mark's Greenbelt. Programs In 2006, the Streissguth family began a volunteer program for the garden. In 2008, dedicated volunteer workers contributed a total of 157 hours toward beautification and maintenance.

It used the 127 bhp, 16-valve, 2-litre version of the Triumph slant-four engine from the Triumph Dolomite Sprint, a highly tuned version of which, \\"rated at 225 bhp at 8000 rpm\\" by 1977, was used in the Group 4 TR7 cars of the BL works rally team, from 1976 until 1978. This was instead of the TR7 base model's 105 bhp, 8-valve, 2-litre version of the same basic slant-4 engine. The 16-valve version was originally specified in the Dolomite Sprint at 135 bhp, and carefully assembled, standard engines had been known to give a sustained 150 bhp on the factory test bed. The reasons why so few TR7 Sprints were produced has been a matter of some debate, since it was never a catalogued model. It is widely assumed that the TR7 Sprints were built with the intention of it being produced for sale, but cancelled after only a few had been made. The suggestions are that it was either cancelled as a result of industrial action or because the sales and marketing department did not want it, as it was not a sufficient improvement over the TR7 base model or because it could not meet the 1976 changes to emissions legislation requirements for the US market - at which the TR7 and later TR8 were primarily aimed. It has also been noted that none of the suggested reasons for cancellation are a good match for when the main production ceased about the end of June 1977. Neither do they explain why a 16-valve model would have started production with the TR8 so near, why no proper records for the model have been found, nor why the cars that were built would have been sold off, rather than scrapped or returned to normal specification - as happened to the 25 or so O-series engined TR7 version development cars when that programme was cancelled a few years later. There is, however, some evidence that the 16-valve TR7 model was cancelled in favour of the TR8 in 1975 or 1976. This was with the cancellation of the proposed Dolomite replacement Triumph SD2, which was also to use the 16-valve slant 4 and an electronic fuel injection system that should have met US emissions requirements. These were cancelled after BLMC went bankrupt and was essentially nationalized under the almost £3 billion plan in the Ryder Report (British Leyland), which was still in force well into 1977. But BL had still needed some 16-valve engined TR7s in 1977 as homologation specials, which had to be \\"meant for the normal sale\\" and needed some supporting documentation. This was to continue rallying the 16-valve TR7 into 1978, following a change to the FIA's rules, which applied to the TR7, and several other rally cars. A second approval for the use of the 16-valve head on the Group 4 TR7 rally car was granted by the FIA in February 1978 in time for its use in the Mintex rally of that year. Technical specification Engine: Triumph Slant Four 1,998cc 16 valve Capacity: 1998 cc Valves: 16 Compression ratio: 9.5:1 Fuel system: Twin 1¾\\" choke SU HS6 carburettors Maximum Power: 127 bhp @ 5200 rpm (estimated) Maximum Torque: 122 lb ft @ 4500 rpm (estimated) Performance Data 0–60 mph: 8.5 seconds (estimated) Max speed: 120 mph (estimated) The improvements in the 0–60 time and top speed over the TR7's 9.6 seconds and 111 mph are not huge. However, the figures for the 16 valve version of the TR7 are almost identical to those for the US specification carburettor version of the 3.5 litre 135 bhp Rover V8 powered Triumph TR8, which are 120 mph and 8.4 seconds. Also, one of the then Triumph engine development engineers is quoted as saying \\"The real test was the 30–50, 50–70 [mph] times and here the Sprint was significantly superior to the 2V [2 valves per cylinder] engine and even challenged the TR8's abilities. Certainly, if we were going 'off site' the preferred vehicle to 'borrow' was a Sprint TR7 over all others and that includes the TR8.\\" Also, despite being specified at 127 bhp, Spen King related \\"how he went away on holiday and came back to find an engine running on the bed giving 150 bhp at the first build.\\" This would be very close to the 153 PS DIN (±5%) that was given by the Rover V8 engine in the UK Specification TR8. Hence, it is possible that had Triumph produced the TR7 Sprint and TR8 to UK specification, as was apparently planned at one time, there would have been significant debate of their relative merits, some of it probably rather partisan in nature. Production details Press Garage TR7 Sprint Registrations According to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust (BMIHT) archives at the British Motor Museum, Gaydon, there are production records for chassis numbers ACH/4 to ACH/25, and ACH/00501 to ACH/00535 and ACH/00700: 58 cars. Also, ACH 1 is identified by the TR Drivers Club, as UK registration WAC 274S, and that ACH 2 and ACH 3 existed might have been inferred from this: \\"One [unattributed] source states that there were three batches of Sprints, ACH 1 to ACH 25, ACH 501 to ACH 536 and ACH 700 on its own, a total of 62 vehicles.\\" However, following a requested search of the BMIHT records it was discovered that \\"the build records we have for ACH/000535 cover 4 separate sheets and there is no record or build card for chassis number 536 as the next vehicle is chassis number 700.\\" What production records there are at the BMIHT do not provide registration details from which cars might be traced; however, some further details of the cars known to have been produced are provided by the TR Drivers Club.() While the 'A' in the ACH prefix to the commissioning numbers indicate that the factory TR7 Sprints were built at Speke, a Triumph engine development engineer is quoted as saying \\"Some if not all of these cars were definitely converted at Canley from 8-valve to 16-valve\\". The reason given for this is that \\"the Speke unions wanted added bonuses for dealing with 'non-standard' cars.\\" However, there were at least some built on the production line at Speke: another Triumph employee, responsible for engineering liaison between Speke and Canley, is quoted as saying that \\"At the changeover in July 1977 (to the new common underframe) we built a batch of thirty TR7 Sprints.\\" The TR Drivers Club website gives details for only two of the first group of 25 chassis numbers: what was presumably the first prototype, WAC 274S, and one other, WAC 253S. Both known cars from this group were registered in Coventry in September 1977. It is suggested that most of the other cars in this batch were LHD and sold abroad. According to an inspection of the BMIHT archives, of the cars in this batch of 25 chassis numbers, at least were 11 LHD (some records have been lost) and 3 were UK specification - the remaining 11 are 'unknown' but assumed to be LHD. The first two cars of the second group of chassis numbers were both white, and registered in Coventry as VVC 696S and VVC 697S in August 1977. These were, according to an owner written article in the TR Driver's Club Magazine from 1991,() used for reliability testing. While there are no reliable details for BL's use of these actual cars, according to one source the procedure used with the TR7 and TR8 was to run a test car on the Belgian pavé track at MIRA for 1000 miles, \\"effectively providing wear harder than a vehicle might experience in a lifetime of normal use\\". The same source also states that \\"A related assessment exercise for the TR7 was the '90 day corrosion test', for which a prototype was built without the usual zinc primer or anti-corrosion treatments and the body painted white, the best colour to show up any rust streaks.\\" A Triumph engineer is quoted as saying, \\"this prototype was run around a variety of road surfaces under wet conditions and then the damp areas were checked. The vehicle was then fitted with a series of nozzles which sprayed salt solution into these same areas\\". Thirty cars from this second group of chassis numbers were sequentially registered SJW 521S to SJW 550S (see Figure 4) in Birmingham in three groups in November 1977, and it is repeatedly claimed that they went to the BL press garage at the Canley site, Coventry; presumably for publicity purposes. It is also claimed that these cars were stripped and re- trimmed, and possibly also re-sprayed. However, the only evidence for this is that production record trace certificates for many of these SJW cars from the BMIHT state they were for a press release, and such cars would normally have gone to the Press garage. This statement is itself based only on most of the cars having \\"UK PRESS VEHICLE\\" handwritten in felt-tip pen on their build cards. Also, the TR7 Sprint Homologation pictures show no evidence of the work it is suggested would have been done to a press car, even though the pictures were taken only days before its disposal by Sales and Marketing Dept. and months after its production and departure from Speke in July 1977. Another car of this second group of chassis numbers was registered in Coventry as ARW 181S in July 1978. According to a letter from the then archivist, reporting the research of the BMIHT records, \\"This car was originally intended for display at the 1977 [ Daily Express ] Motorfair in Earls Court, London. We can not verify whether it was in fact displayed here.\\" This car was factory fitted with engine CH 2 HE which it still has as of September 2017. It seems that the last car built in October 1977, ACH/00700, was intended for a motorshow in Scotland. However, again, it is not know if it was actually used for that. The addition of two leading zeros to this second group of chassis numbers to make them five digits, the same length as production TR7's chassis numbers, may indicate these were pre-production cars, not prototypes. However, the differences in where and by which division of BL they were registered (from their (V55) registration documents), indicates that they may still not have been manufactured as a single batch. Hence, it is possible that the press garage (SJW) cars were the \\"batch of thirty TR7 Sprints\\" built at \\"the changeover in July 1977\\", and the cars in the first group, and possibly some of the second, may have been those built as 8-valve cars at Speke, and converted to 16-valve at Canley. Distinguishing features \\"There are a [comparatively] large number of privately built Sprint conversions about... Buyers should beware of this if they are asked a premium price for an alleged 'genuine' TR7 Sprint\\": all the essential parts to turn a TR7 into a functional copy of a TR7 Sprint, though not an identical one, can either be sourced from a Dolomite Sprint or remain available from suppliers; several companies sell conversion kits online; and several sources provide information and advice on this TR7 Sprint conversion. One of which states, \\"this upgrade brings you into the same power band as an original TR8, but for a fraction of the cost, effort and time.\\" There are also a number of websites dedicated to the Sprint and Sprint conversions, () and at least one forum. It seems that there is no disagreement that \\"[a]ll [factory TR7 Sprint] cars were fixed-head coupes\\", that the period over which they were built spans the changeover between the 1977 and 1978 year models, and both right and left hand drive cars were produced. Those TR7 Sprints that are known were fitted with the 5-speed gearbox mated to the 3.89:1 rear axle that was standard on the 5-speed TR7s. The pre-production cars had the alloy wheels that were optional for later TR7s and standard on Solihull built fixed-heads. =Engine and interior= TR7 Sprint Chassis Plate TR7 Sprint Engine number stamping (CH62HE) TR7 Sprint Interior The factory produced TR7 Sprints have chassis numbers that are prefixed with letters ACH; whereas, UK/Australian/European specification TR7s of the time were prefixed ACG: Figure 5 shows a chassis or commissioning plate from a TR7 Sprint car, mounted on the left-hand door, below the door lock. The TR7 Sprint engines are also prefixed with CH, rather than GC on the TR7's and VA on Dolomite Sprint engines; however, the TR7 Sprint engine numbers can, at least in some cases, be very hard to read (see Figure 6). There are a number of auxiliary engine parts specific to the TR7 Sprint, and not used on the Dolomite Sprint engine: the cast steel exhaust manifold (RKC2788), the front pipe of the exhaust system (which has been remanufactured, RB7385), and a water transfer plate at the back of the cylinder head (also remanufactured, RB7240). A number of parts in the throttle linkage are also unique to the TR7 Sprint, most obviously the link plate between the two carburettors (just visible in Figure 2, and partially obscuring the inlet manifold in Figure 3), which was not fitted to the Dolomite Sprint; and the throttle lever/link rod (visible just over the air box in Figure 3), which looks the same as the TR7 part, but is longer to allow for the carbs being further apart. The front disks were specific to the TR7 Sprint, although the callipers and dust shields, etc., were as those used on the TR8; so TR8 disks fit. There are also at least two different Engine information panels (UKC 8605 and TKC 5228), on the underside of the bonnet, some of which only indicate TR7, but provide slightly different information to that on the equivalent TR7 part (UKC 6246). There are online photographs of some of these parts.() At least some of the cars were fitted with the large semi-circular pad on the steering wheel from the US specification TR7 (RKC82) (see Figure 7). There is one unsupported claim that \\"Having a higher-revving engine, the Sprint received a recalibrated rev counter\\". However, this is incorrect: both engines had a rev limit of 6500 rpm indicated on the rev counter, though both owners' manuals give the \\"Maximum recommended engine speed (intermittent)\\" as 6,000 rpm. Hence, the TR7 and TR7 Sprint shared a common rev counter. =Exterior= Triumph TR7 Sprint from rear, showing side stripe intended for the production version It appears that the exterior of the pre-production TR7 Sprints was, and presumably the production cars would have been, indistinguishable from the TR7 of the day, apart from the decals and side stripes. However, it is reported that a number of different decal sets were being tried out on the prototype cars. There are a number of published photographs of TR7 Sprints bearing decals simply comprising the word \\"SPRINT\\" on the front panel and boot lid below the 'TR7' decal of Speke built TR7s, and described as \\"The logo that appeared on the boot lid of most of the few TR7 Sprints that escaped from the factory.\\" These used the same font as the TR7 decal applied to Speke built TR7s and in the side stripes used later on the TR7 Premium edition. There is also a description of a car \\"with the word 'Sprint' written large on the right of the boot lid, the TR7 decal being on the left\\". However, none of these photographs can be identified to cars that had not been owner modified. Whereas, these decals form part of the set displayed on the FHC TR8 shown in the TR8's homologation papers (FIA #654), identifying it as a \\"Sprint TR7 V8\\". These Sprint decals were at one time available (in three sizes) from Moss Europe (previously TriumphTune), though they were not catalogue items or identified to a BL part number or numbers. One size is still available as supplier part No. RB7206BLACK/SILVER/GOLD. There is also a published photograph of what appears to be a US Spec., 1977 year model car carrying side stripes with the word \\"Sprint\\" on the rear wings, the caption to which states \\"The sides of the TR7 Sprint were supposed to have received this striping treatment, designed by John Ashford, had the car gone into production.\\" These side stripes were, at one time, listed by Moss Europe under BL part numbers YKC2082-2087. They are also shown in a series of 6 \\"TR7 Sprint Homologation\\" photographs in the BMIHT Film and Picture Library, taken on 1 November 1977 before the car was sold-off by BL. The car in these photographs from the BMIHT does not carry the \\"SPRINT\\" decals, described above, on either boot lid or front panel. The TR7 Sprint shown in figures 1 and 8 is, in this respect, identical with these photographs, except for the colours. The stripes themselves were later reworked for the TR7 Premium edition after the TR7 Sprint was still born. Publications The BL TR7 Repair Operations Manual, AKM3079A, covers both the 4 and 2 valve (per cylinder) engines; however, an erratum stuck to the title page states \\"At the time of going to press the 4 valve engine referred to in this manual has not been fitted to the Triumph TR7\\". An owner's handbook, AKM 3967, was also produced for TR7 Sprint in 1977, but is apparently for the 1977 year model: it shows the interior light in the headlining not the doors. Also some of the information is incorrect for the TR7 Sprint, i.e. pictures show the 8 valve engine and the TR7's AC Delco distributor. However, it also lists only the 5 speed (LT77) gearbox, unlike the similar handbook for the TR7, RTC 9210, which lists the 4 speed, and the 5 speed as an option. The FIA's 1976 rules for homologation, which applied to the re-homologation of the 16-valve head for the group 4 TR7 rally car, approved in February 1978, state that in \\"checking of a model of car against its recognition form\\" the scruteneers may refer to \\"the maintenance booklet published for the use of the make's distributors\\". These two documents may have been intended to fulfil such a requirement, since the handbook is not intended for the distributor and the ROM is not well described as a booklet. Motorsports The TR7s used by BL in Group 4 rallying, from their advent in the Welsh rally of 1976 to the Circuit of Ireland in 1978, also used (tuned) 16-valve 2 litre Sprint engines, which by 1977 was rated at \\"rated at 225 bhp at 8000 rpm\\". These 16-valve TR7 rally cars proved competitive on asphalt, winning a number of events including the Belgian Boucles de Spa rally in 1977. They were replaced by the Rover V8 3.5 litre engined TR7V8. Four of the later BL works rally cars carried the registrations of cars from the press garage, SJW 533S, SJW 540S, SJW 546S, and SJW 548S. SJW 533S was initially campaigned as a 4 cylinder 16 valve car, and later as a V8 3.5 Litre TR7V8 specification. The other three were only ever campaigned as TR8s. However, it is not clear whether or not the four rally cars bearing these registrations actually were, in any real sense, the TR7 Sprints from the press garage, or whether only the registrations were used. There is a story at one TR7 related website (), and already current in the 1980s, that John Davenport, \\"needed white cars without sunrooves [sic] and these were the nearest four.\\" However, Bill Price wrote \\"As I think is known, four of the [TR7] Sprint press release car registration numbers were 'inherited' by BL Motorsport and used to identify four TR7 V8 'works' rally cars.\\"TR Register, TR Action, Issue 297, April 2017 Also, according to the press garage data (Figure 4), SJW 533S was russet, SJW 540S was java green, SJW 546S was brooklands green, and SJW 548S was carmine; though none had sun-roofs. While there are suggestions that the cars sent to the press garage were re-trimmed and even possibly re-sprayed, there are no suggestions that their paint colours were changed, and the competitions department could, presumably, have managed that themselves, were it significant. Equally anecdotally, a more complete reproduction of the 1991 owner written article from the TR Driver's Club magazine states \\"Although the SJW TR7V8 rally cars began life as TR7 Sprints, the rally cars were scratch built using bodies taken off the line and prepared by Safety Devices. So only the registration numbers from the sprints were used.\\"() =Homologation= Initial homologation There is some confusion over exactly how the TR7 was homologated (for group 4) with the 16 valve engine, close ratio sprint gearbox and overdrive, and heavy duty rear axle before any TR7 Sprints were produced. Rally journalist and historian Graham Robson refers to the \\"famous 'inventive homologation' skills\\" of Bill Price, then workshop manager at BL Special Tuning (ST) at Abingdon, and to him \\"perhaps, taking lessons from Ralph Broad, who was an old hand at the black art of 'reading the rules'\\", and states that \\"Bill [Price] managed to gain approval for a TR7 which was only loosely related to the production car.\\" Bill Price himself wrote on this issue \\"Careful consideration was given to the existing specification with the result that we decided to list the 16-valve Sprint cylinder head to enable us to virtually transplant the Sprint rally engine into the car. The Sprint gearbox was homologated as the 77mm five-speed [LT77] gearbox was not yet available and it would take time to produce close ratio gears for it. The heavy duty axle which would be standard with the five-speed gearbox was also listed [for Group 3] as an [export] option\\". However, Graham Robson quotes BL Motorsport director John Davenport remembering \\"that the '100-off' rule applied to alternative engines at the time (which explains why Ford was able to race 24-valve four-cam Capris in 1974), but this waiver never applied to transmissions.\\" The 100-off rule was a section of the FIA's rules for homologating Group 4 cars (actually, for homologating Group 2 cars, but also applicable to Group 4). It covered a list of \\"Optional equipment which may be recognized with a minimum production of 100 units per year to equip 100 cars\\". While John Davenport was correct that, in 1975, this list included alternative cylinder heads with different numbers of valves, it also did include alternative gearboxes with overdrives, flywheels, clutches and their housing, and many other engine, transmission, and suspension components. Such optional equipment could be recognized as \\"bolt-on option kits\\", which had to be \\"available freely at the manufacturer's or his dealers' for any one wishing to purchase it\\" - as would have been the case with the 16-valve head and its drive (pistons, carbs, and manifolds could be changed freely for Group 4), and for the overdriven gearbox, which would have been available as spare parts for the Dolomite Sprint (the heavy duty axle was homologated for Group 3, and thus 4, by a different means). But when the 16-valve TR7 was homologated for Group 4 in October 1975, the 100-off rule did not require the production of any 16-valve engined road cars, only the kits needed to equip them. However, the 100-off rule also required that the kits could be fitted \\"without it being necessary to machine or modify the remaining mechanical parts\\" and therefore \\"it must be possible to reassemble the whole unit with all its original parts\\", and they \\"must be mentioned in the manufacturer's catalogue of spare parts for the model concerned\\". While the FIA rules failed to precisely define the catalogue or its level of distribution, the 16-valve head and overdriven gearbox were not listed in the generally available TR7 parts catalogue. Also, there is no obvious article in the homologation rules that covered the recognition of the heavy duty rear axle for Group 3 in 1975. This component was, however, recognized for Group 3 a second time, presumably after the production of sufficient 5-speed TR7s, in January 1977. A number of other modifications were listed in the amendment (1/1V) to the TR7's homologation for the Group 4 TR7, such as larger front callipers and rear disk brakes. These were allowed from a list of \\"Optional equipment which may be recognized without a minimum production\\". Other modifications that are not listed in the papers, such as suspension components and axle locating arms, etc., were given as freely allowed to be changed or added without need of being specifically recognized as part of the homologation process. Rule change for 1976 \\"Effective from the end of 1977, the FIA banned alternative cylinder heads\\" and removed the 100-off rule for 1976. As a result, several teams had, at this time, to remove similar equipment from their cars, including the Toyota Celica, Vauxhall Chevette HS, and Lancia Stratos. Ford, however, produced additional Ford Escort RS1800 (X0) cars in 1977 and were able to continue to use it (transferred to Group 4 as the Escort RS) with the BDG engine (a 16-valve Cosworth head on an aluminium alloy version of the Kent block) in 1978. This change to the FIA's rules was published in December 1975, soon after the TR7 was homologated for Group 4, and would come into effect before the TR8 - which was intended to replace the TR7 in rallying -, would be ready: \\"John Davenport's team had not been certain it would be available to them until the very day that homologation was granted - on 1 April 1978.\\" Hence, BL had the Sprint 16-valve head recognized for a second time, which was granted in February 1978 in time for its use in the Mintex rally of that year. Without the 100-off rule this could only have been done on the production of at least some 16-valve engined TR7s meant for normal sale, i.e. \\"distribution of cars to individual purchasers through the normal commercial channels of the manufacturer\\". While the rules did not specify that any of these cars actually had to have been sold for approval to be granted, it is noted that \\"[f]ollowing the cancellation of the project, normal practice might have been to dismantle the cars or convert them to normal TR7 power, but surprisingly most were sold off to private buyers.\\" This expectation is supported by what happened to the 25 or so cars of the failed O-series engine TR7 development programme, which were either scrapped or converted to TR8s before sale. It is also the case that the 400 or so Fixed Head Coupe TR8s (approx. 150 ACT and 250 TCT chassis numbered cars) were sold off when that did not become a catalogued item. However these were needed for its homologation approval (granted 1 April 1978), and would have been covered by the same FIA requirement to be \\"meant for the normal sale\\". And while, at most, only 150 of these had been built at the time the approval was granted, it is also noted (in relation to the approval of the Vauxhall Chevette HS) that \\"due to the recognised difficulties of producing 400 cars down a modern production line, there had arisen an understanding that some leeway was allowed. For instance, if the 400 cars were built within a few months of the homologation date then the car would normally be allowed through.\\" While the number of cars required by the FIA to homologate a modification to a Group 4 car does not appear to be known, 50 cars are said to have been required for some similar modifications of the era, such as the 1977 RS1800 X0 version, the Vauxhall Chevette HSR, and the Porsche 924 Carrera GTS. The role of the TR7 Sprints in this process is shown by the series of 6 photographs of one of the press garage cars (later registered as SJW 530S), taken on 1 November 1977, listed in the BMIHT Film and Picture Library as \\"TR7 Sprint Homologation\\". It may also be noted that production of the TR7 Sprints began almost immediately after the homologation of the 5-speed TR7 for group 3 (in January 1977), when the specification of the 16-valve cars needed to re-homologate the head would have become clear, and that production basically stopped soon after 50 cars had been produced around the end of June 1977 (only 3 cars produced after that, probably all for specific purposes). It may also be noted that in mid November 1977 (9th to 23rd), just after the homologation pictures had been taken, the 30 SJW cars, supposed to have gone to the press garage, were transferred out of the keeping Sales and Marketing Longbridge, into that of the Power Train Division, which is identified in the process of the disposal of similar cars. Cancellation It has been an issue of conjecture and debate if the TR7 Sprint ever really was intended for full series production as a catalogued model and why so few were made if it was. There had been significant speculation regarding the possible production of a 16-valve version of the TR7 from the outset. This was because the two engines used the same block, etc., so it seemed an obvious development. It is even claimed that it was one of the most anticipated sports cars of the 1970s. The usual reason given for the cancellation of the TR7 Sprint is the 17-week-long strike at the BL Speke plant, where the TR7 and at least some of the TR7 Sprints were manufactured, starting at the beginning of November 1977. This resulted in the closure of the plant in May 1978, the move of production to Canley, Coventry, and, it is said, led to the cancellation of the TR7 Sprint. However, this industrial action is itself blamed, ultimately, on the \\"replacement of the aristocratic Lord Stokes with South African businessman Michael Edwardes\\" as managing director, announced in Nov 1977. These events therefore occur well after the main production ceased in early July 1977, and probably too late to be responsible for the change of status indicated by the start of the transfer of the press garage cars out of the keeping of Sales and Marketing, on 9 November 1977. Another reason given for the cancellation is that \\"the Marketing department killed it because the 0-60 acceleration times were identical to the 2V engine with little increase in top speed.\\" However, this lack of significant difference is disputed, and no reason is given for why any TR7 Sprints should have been produced if Sales and Marketing did not want it. The only apparent reason given that is attributed to a credible source within BL (Mike Dale, then BL US VP of Sales and Marketing) links the cancellation of the TR7 Sprint model to the cancellation of the cost-reduced, fuel injected version of the 16-valve slant-four engine. This was being developed because, unlike the TR7 and TR8, the Sprint's 16 valve engine was not suitable for the vehicle emissions control equipment needed for the US market, which was the main target market for the TR7 and 8. This engine was originally being developed for the Triumph SD2, which was cancelled in 1975. Moreover, the cost-reduction programme appears to have been cancelled in 1975, before SD2 became part of the Triumph-Morris TM1 programme, which was also cancelled later in 1975, and the fuel injection system did not make it to Dolomite Sprint production, which continued until 1980. This cancellation with SD2 in 1975 is supported by the 1975 Ryder report, which followed the bankruptcy of BLMC, provided the nearly £3 billion pound rescue plan for BL through ownership by the National Enterprise Board,and identified BL’s critical need for rationalization of the range of competing models and engine types produced by BLMC. Whereas, the start of production of the TR7 Sprint does follow immediately after the homologation of the 5-speed gearbox and the HD axle (for the group 3 TR7) in January 1977, which the extra power of the 16-valve engine needed: it is at this point that the specification of the car needed to re-homologate the Group 4 TR7 under the new rules became certain. The end of main production, in early July 1977, also follows soon after production reaches 50 cars with build records, which appears to be the number required by the FIA for such evolutions. Further, their transfer out of the keeping of sales and marketing follows only 8 days after the TR7 Sprint Homologation pictures were apparently taken, which, presumably coincides with their inspection prior to granting the second approval of the 16-valve head. Hence, the anecdotal references to \\"production\\" of the TR7 Sprint may - as the term production is used with several other homologation specials, like the Vauxhall Chevette HSR and Porsche 924 Carrera GTS - refer to the few needed for this process of homologating such a modification. When the TR7 Sprint programme ended, and the cars became redundant, \\"most were sold off to private buyers\\" and some went into BL's management car plan and were leased to BL employees, and a number are known to still exist.

The screenplay was adapted by Jane Murfin, along with Samuel Shipman and John B. Hymer, based on Shipman and Hymer's 1927 play, Crime. Plot Gene Fenmore is a suave gentleman, safely ensconced in the upper crust of society. Unbeknownst to his society acquaintances, he is also the leader of the largest mob in the city. But it is a mob with scruples, thanks to Fenmore, and they only prey on dishonest businessmen, and never shoot or kill anyone. However, there is a power struggle developing between Fenmore and his number two man, Rocky, who disagrees with the moral constraints put on the gang by Fenmore. The tension between the two men is exacerbated by the fact Rocky has taken Fenmore's girlfriend, Dot away from him. As he starts to exert his influence on the other gang members, Rocky holds up a young engaged couple, Nancy and Tommy, of their last few dollars for the fun of it. When Fenmore hears of the robbery, he gives them back their money and takes them under his wing, offering the both of them jobs on the legitimate side of his business. When Rocky sees that Fenmore has taken a liking to the couple, he develops a plan to use them in order to take over Fenmore's gang. Even though Fenmore has given explicit orders not to involve the couple in the illicit activities of the gang, Rocky takes them along when he goes to hold up a jewelry store. When the robbery goes wrong, Rocky ends up shooting and killing the owner of the store, after which he frames Tommy and Annabelle for the crime. In order to set things right, Fenmore orchestrates a confrontation with the police, wherein he confesses to the jewelry store robbery, and in the ensuing melee, Rocky is killed. As he is led off in handcuffs, Fenmore turns to the police officer and says, \\"If it wasn't for men like me, they wouldn't need men like you.\\"  Cast  *Lowell Sherman as Gene Fenmore *Marian Nixon as Nancy *Hugh Trevor as Rocky *William Janney as Tommy *Helene Millard as Dot *George F.

The building of Brentford Dock was started in 1855 and it was formally opened in 1859. The former dock yard was redeveloped in 1972 and is now Brentford Dock Marina and Brentford Dock Estate. History Brentford map, 1856 showing the island to the east of Syon Park that was the site of the dock The original dock was built on a large island between the River Thames and two mouths of the River Brent. Part of the land was owned by timber merchant James Montgomrey in the 19th century. Brentford Dock was built by Great Western and Brentford Railway Company (later part of the GWR), to the south of the mouth of the River Brent and Grand Junction Canal, and opposite Kew Gardens. Montgomrey had sold part of his Montgomrey's Wharf premises to the company in 1855, including a corridor crossing the canal and river that enabled road access from the High Street (called Dock Road). The dock was constructed to a design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The entrance to the dock was via a lock from the River Thames. The company also built the Brentford Branch Line to it from the GWR main line at Southall, which was originally at 7 ft gauge and terminated at the dock. Construction began in 1855 and was completed in 1859. Brunel's original covered dock was destroyed by fire in 1920 and replaced by an iron and steel structure. The dock provided a trans-shipment point for goods between the railway network and barges operating on the Thames to the Port of London. Brentford Dock, 1960 on an Ordnance Survey map After World War I the Thames frontage was adapted for boats of up to 300 tons. Craft using the dock included heavy river barges, canal boats and sailing barges, and the dock offered customs facilities. Traffic included coal, steel, timber, wood pulp, flour, animal feedstuffs, cork, general merchandise and, in the 1950s, Morris cars from Oxford. Coke from Southall Gas Works was carried in daily block trains from Southall to the dock. Closure and redevelopment Brentford Dock Estate, north side of Dock The dock closed on 31 December 1964. It was redeveloped as housing and a marina in 1972 by the Greater London Council (GLC), to a design by architect Sir Roger Walters completed in 1968. Construction work for the Brentford Dock housing estate began in 1972 and was the project was completed in 1978. The construction of Brentford Dock Marina started in 1978 and the official opening was on 7 August 1980.

He is clear about the goal: “Chance liberates us from the limitations of our intention,” McCulloh writes. “Chance subverts control, allowing art to become an opening into the world’s full complexity.”See “Everybody feels like they have control over things,” McCulloh told interviewer Marilyn Thomsen in 2003, “but I think the world mostly operates by strange chance. If the world operates by chance, why not use [chance] as a way of encountering the world directly?” In 2009, McCulloh summarized his methods: “I create systems driven by chance operations: random sampling, chance drawings, map transects. Then I set the systems in motion and record what chance provides.” Art critic Christopher Miles positioned McCulloh's strategy within art history: “In order to take both his own preconceptions and popular constructions out of the picture, Douglas McCulloh has done something clever and simple. McCulloh merely merged the tradition of social documentary photography á la Robert Frank with the Surrealist approach of creating a system that forces the artist to act at the mercy of chance.”See Major works =Chance Encounters (1992-2002)= Chance Encounters is a photographic sampling project controlled by a map gridded into 5,151 quarter-mile squares that encompass all of urban Los Angeles County. McCulloh begins each day of photography by pulling chance coordinates that select one random quarter-mile square, according to a book on the project.See McCulloh then travels to that quarter-mile square with a single camera and 18mm wide angle lens, speaking “with almost everyone he encounters” and making more than 20,000 photographs.See “McCulloh’s working method avoids pitfalls by adopting the Dadaist strategy of leaving things to chance,” stated Los Angeles Times art critic William Wilson. “He selects areas at random, spending a day shooting whatever he finds – beach, slum or riverbed slime. A traveling exhibition of Chance Encounters was curated by California Museum of Photography director Jonathan Green. =On the Beach (2000-2007)= With a high resolution camera and studio lighting, McCulloh and collaborator Jacques Garnier made photographs on beaches in California and Florida over a seven-year period. “Beaches are half display, half voyeurism,” stated the Southeast Museum of Photography about the project. “This is the precise terrain of photography – one side posing, the other looking. Cameras belong on the beach.”See The photographers set up studio lighting at crowded beaches and “sample the passing parade like scientists who periodically dip water out of a flowing stream.”See The resulting photographs are “infinitely less guarded than posed portraits,” states arts writer Laura Stewart. “They tell vivid stories about the beach and its people, and about those of us who are given the unusual freedom to stare.”See Kevin Miller, director of the Southeast Museum of Photography in Daytona Beach, Florida, originated an exhibition and book on the project. The work has also been shown at museums including the Laguna Art Museum, Autry National Center of the American West, and California Museum of Photography.See See =20,000 Portraits (2001)= McCulloh and collaborator Ted Fisher led 68 artists, photographers, and volunteers in a project that photographed 20,558 visitors to the Los Angeles County Fair.See A short documentary about the project reveals the working methodology – four digital shooting stations built into the fair's fine art pavilion; one image of each person is made and a database created with subject's answers to five questions: first name, age, gender, and zip code, and “What makes you unique?” 20,000 Portraits was in the vanguard of database- driven art projects and has been shown widely, most prominently in the LA Freewaves 2002 New Media Biennial in Los Angeles.See =The Legacy Project (2002-continuing)= The Legacy Project is a 15-year art project focused on a major closed United States military base: Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in Orange County, California. As of September 2007, the six photographers – Jerry Burchfield, Mark Chamberlain, Jacques Garnier, Rob Johnson, Douglas McCulloh, and Clayton Spada – had made more than 90,000 photographs, according to reports published by arts writer Liz Goldner.See For 50 years, the 4,700-acre El Toro base was at the heart of Marine Corps air operations, playing pivotal roles in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the first Gulf War.See In an extensive essay, art critic and curator Mark Johnstone, equates the ambitious scope and scale of the Legacy Project to other major photographic surveys, specifically the geographic surveys of the American West in the 1800s, the Historical Section of the Farm Security Administration (1935–1942), and the National Endowment for the Arts Surveys (1976–1981).See Legacy Project work has been shown in many exhibitions, including Laguna Art Museum, Chapman University, Art Center College of Design, Cypress College, Orange Coast College, and the City of Los Angeles Angels Gate Cultural Center.See =Dream Street (2003-2009)= McCulloh won the right to name a street in Southern California at a charity auction. He then spent hundreds of hours at the place he named “Dream Street,” producing 12,891 photos, 47½ hours of recordings, three bankers’ boxes of notes, maps and e-mails” and ultimately a book.See See The 134-home, 40-acre subdivision is a microcosm of the new economy, a site where issues of race and gender, immigration and exploitation, hopes and dreams animate a classic California landscape.See See Susan Brenneman, writing in the Los Angeles Times, called Dream Street “a classic tale, recast for Southern California: the American dream, tied to the almighty dollar and abundant cheap labor, dependent, equally, on self-deception and inextinguishable hope.” “For those of us who live on one of California’s streets of dreams,” writes author D.J. Waldie “the history of how this one was made is of enormous importance as a warning and a guide.”See =60,000 Photographs in Hollywood (2003-continuing)= McCulloh was given a commission to document Hollywood in 60,000 photographs by the City of Los Angeles “L.A. Neighborhoods Project.”See “The result,” states photographer and writer Aline Smithson, “is a massive and multi-layered artistic inquiry. Map-driven and infused with data and first-hand narrative, the project moves beyond traditions of the isolated photographic image. Instead the project emphasizes complexity, multiplicity, extreme volume, and the interplay of image, data, map, and text.”See McCulloh's Hollywood work has been exhibited in the U.S. and Europe and has become part of the permanent photo archive of the City of Los Angeles. =The Great Picture (2006)= The Great Picture hanging in its hangar-camera. The Great Picture is the largest photograph ever made as a single seamless image, produced on July 8, 2006, using a Southern California jet hangar transformed into a giant camera.See The 3,505.75 square-foot (325.44 m²) photograph was made to mark the end of 165 years of film/chemistry-based photography and the start of the age of digital photography.See It was made by The Legacy Group; (Jerry Burchfield, Mark Chamberlain, Jacques Garnier, Rob Johnson, Douglas McCulloh, and Clayton Spada). Dimensions of the photograph are 31 feet, 7 inches (9.62 meters) high x 111 feet (33.83 meters) wide. Aspect ratio is 3.47:1. The photograph is of the control tower and runways at the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, Orange County, California. The exposure was 35 minutes long and development took 5 hours, 70 people and 1,800 gallons (6,814 liters) of black-and-white chemistry.See The Great Picture has been written about in more than 500 publications, states art writer Liz Goldner, including Art in America, Photographie, AfterImage, Juxtapoz, Black and White Magazine, Los Angeles Times, and Chicago Tribune.See =Sight Unseen (2009-continuing)= McCulloh is curator of Sight Unseen: International Photography by Blind Artists for the UCR/California Museum of Photography.

Sight Unseen was shown at UCR/California Museum of Photography from May 2 to August 29, 2009, and has since traveled to the Kennedy Center for the Arts in Washington, D.C.; Centro de la Imagen, Mexico City; and Flacon, Moscow.See See The exhibition is the first major museum exhibition of blind photographers, states Stacy Davies in ArtSlant.See Writing for Time Magazine, Matt Kettman quotes McCulloh on the conceptual underpinning of the work: “The whole trajectory of modern art for the last 100 years has been toward the concept of art as mental construction, and blind photography comes from that place. They’re creating that image in their head first — really elaborate, fully realized visions — and then bringing some version of that vision into the world for the rest of us to see.”See Published works  References External links * Douglas McCulloh's Official Website * Douglas McCulloh's Photo Quotations Website * The Legacy Project's Official Website * Los Angeles Public Library Virtual Gallery of Chance Encounters: The L.A.

However, they produce only marginal improvements in measurement accuracy and may still require significant length of straight pipe, which a cramped installation site may not permit.  Natural gas measurement  Natural gas that carries a lot of liquids with it is known as wet gas whereas natural gas that is produced without liquid is known dry gas. Dry gas is also treated as to remove all liquids. The effect of flow conditioning for various popular meters which is used in gas measurement is explained below.  Pipe flow conditions  The most important as well as most difficult to measure aspects of flow measurement are flow conditions within a pipe upstream of a meter. Flow conditions mainly refer to the flow velocity profile, irregularities in the profile, varying turbulence levels within the flow velocity or turbulence intensity profile, swirl and any other fluid flow characteristics which will cause the meter to register flow different than that expected. It will change the value from the original calibration state referred to as reference conditions that are free of installation effects.Miller, W. Richard, \\"Flow Measurement Engineering Handbook\\", McGraw-Hill, Third Edition, 1996, = Installation effects = Installation effects such as insufficient straight pipe, exceptional pipe roughness or smoothness, elbows, valves, tees and reducers causes the flow conditions within the pipe to vary from the reference conditions. How these installation effects impact the meter is very important since devices which create upstream installation effects are common components of any standard metering design. Flow Conditioning refers to the process of artificially generating a reference, fully developed flow profile and is essential to enable accurate measurement while maintaining a cost-competitive meter standard design. The meter calibration factors are valid only of geometric and dynamic similarity exists between the metering and calibration conditions. In fluid mechanics, this is commonly referred to as the Law of Similarity.Flow conditioning for Natural gas measurement = Law of similarity = The principle of Law of Similarity is used extensively for theoretical and experimental fluid machines. With respect to calibration of flowmeters, the Law of Similarity is the foundation for flow measurement standards. To satisfy the Law of Similarity, the central facility concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the laboratory meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire custody transfer period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations. The meter factor determined at the time of calibration is valid if both dynamic and geometric similarity exists between the field installation and the laboratory installation of the artifact. A proper manufacturer’s experimental pattern locates sensitive regions to explore, measure and empirically adjust. The manufacturer’s recommended correlation method is a rational basis for performance prediction provided the physics do not change. For instance, the physics are different between subsonic and sonic flow. To satisfy the Law of Similarity the in situ calibration concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the calibrated meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire custody transfer period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations. The meter factor determined at the time of calibration is valid if both dynamic and geometric similarity exists in the “field meter installation” over the entire custody transfer period.The effects of flow conditioning = Velocity flow profile = Figure (1) showing typical velocity flow profile for natural gas measurementThe most commonly used description of flow conditions within the pipe is the flow velocity profile. Fig.(1) shows the typical flow velocity profile for natural gas measurement.Karnik, U., \\"Measurements of the Turbulence Structure Downstream of a Tubs Bundle at High Reynolds Numbers\\", ASME Fluids Engineering Meeting, Washington D.C., June 1993 The shape of the flow velocity profile is given by the following equation, {frac{U_y}{U_{max}}} = left [ 1 - frac{Y}{R} right ]^{1/n}  (1) The value of n determines the shape of the flow velocity profile. The eq.(1) can be used to determine the flow profile's shape within the pipe by fitting a curve to experimentally measured velocity data. In 1993, the transverse flow velocities were being measured within the high pressure natural gas environment using hot wire technology to accomplish the data fit. A fully developed flow profile was used as the reference state for meter calibration and determination of Coefficient of Discharge (Cd). For Reynolds Number 10^5 to 10^6 n is approximately 7.5; for Re of 10^6 , n is approximately 10.0 where a fully developed profile in a smooth pipe was assumed. Since n is a function of Reynolds Number and friction factor, more accurate values of n can be estimated by using the eq.(2), n = frac {1}{sqrt{f}}.  (2) Where, f is friction factor.Colebrook, C.F., 'turbulent Flow in Pipes, with Particular reference to the Transition between the Smooth and Rough Pipe Laws\\", J. Inst Clv. Eng., vol. 11, pp. 133-136, 1938-1939 A good estimate of a fully developed velocity profile can be used for those without adequate equipment to actually measure the flow velocities within the pipe. The following straight pipe equivalent length in eq.(3) was utilized to ensure a fully developed flow profile exists.White M. Frank, \\"Fluids Mechanics\\", Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1986, Pipe Diameters = 4.4D left [R_e right ]^{1/6}  (3) In eq.(3) the pipe lengths required is significant, hence we need some devices that can able to condition the flow over a shorter pipe length allowing metering packages to be cost competitive and accurate. Here the velocity flow profile is generally three-dimensional. Normally the description requires no axial orientation indication if the profile is asymmetric and if it does exists, then axial orientation with respect to some suitable plane of reference is required. Asymmetry exists downstream of installation effects such as elbows or tees. Usually, the velocity flow profile is described on two planes 90° apart. Using the latest software technology a full pipe cross sectional description of the velocity profile is possible provided sufficient data points are given. = Turbulence intensity = The second description of the flow field state within the pipe is the turbulence intensity. According to an experiment in 1994, the metering errors may exist even when the velocity flow profile is fully developed with perfect pipe flow conditions. Conversely, it was found zero metering error at times when the velocity profile was not fully developed. Hence this behavior was referred to the turbulence intensity of the gas flow that can cause metering bias error. This behavior accounts in part for the less than adequate performance of the conventional tube bundle.Kamlk U., Jungowskl W.M., Botros -K., \\"Effect of Turbulence on Orifice Meter Performance\\", 11'\\" International Symposium and Exhibition on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering, ASME, May 1994, Vol. 116 = Swirl = The third description of the flow field's state is swirl. Swirl is the tangential flow component of the velocity vector. The velocity profile should be referred to as the axial velocity profile. As the velocity vector can be resolved into three mutually orthogonal components, the velocity profile only represents the axial component of velocity. fig.(2) showing the Swirl Angle which explains the definition of flow swirl and swirl angle. Note that swirl is usually referenced to full body rotation (that which the full pipeline flow follows one axis of swirl). In real pipeline conditions, such as downstream of elbows two or more mechanisms of swirl may be present.  Effects on flow measurement devices  The condition of a flow can affect the performance and accuracy of devices that measure the flow. = Effects of flow conditioning on Orifice meter = The basic orifice mass flow equation provided by API 14.3 and ISO 5167 is given as, q_m = (C_d)(E_v)(Y)left [ frac{pi}{4} right ](d)^2 sqrt {2 rho Delta P} (4) Where, q_m = Mass flow C_d = Coefficient of discharge E_v = Velocity of approach factor Y = Expansion factor d = orifice diameter rho = density of the fluid Delta P = differential pressure Now to use the eq.(4), the flow field entering the orifice plate must be free of swirl and exhibit a fully developed flow profile. API 14.3 (1990) and ISO standards determined the Coefficient of Discharge by completing numerous calibration tests where the indicated mass flow was compared to the actual mass flow to determine coefficient of discharge. In all testing the common requirement was a fully developed flow profile entering the orifice plate.Scott L.J., Brennan J. A., Blakeslee, NIST, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, \\"NIST DataBase 45 GRI/KIST Orifice Meter Discharge Ceoffcient\\", Version 1.0 N1ST Standard Reference Data Program, Gaithersberg, MD (1994) Accurate standard compliant meter designs must therefore ensure that a swirl free, fully developed flow profile is impinging on the orifice plate. There are numerous methods available to accomplish this. These methods are commonly known as “flow conditioning”. The first installation option is to revert to no flow conditioning, but adequate pipe lengths must be provided by the eq.(2) mentioned above. This generally makes the manufacturing costs for a flow measurement facility unrealistic due to excessively long meter tubes; Imagine meter tubes 75 diameters long. The second and most well known option is the 19-tube tube-bundle flow conditioner. The majority of flow installations in North America contain the tube bundle. With the help of hot wire, pitot tube and laser-based computerized measurement systems which allow detailed measurement of velocity profile and turbulence intensity; we know that the tube bundle does not provide fully developed flow.Kamlk, U., \\"A compact Orifice Meter/Flow Conditioner Package\\", 3rd international Symposium of Fluid Flow Measurement, San Antonio, Texas., March, 1995 Therefore, this device is causing biased orifice flow measurement. As a result of these recent findings, few tube bundles are specified for flow measurement and reduce the use of such device. Numerous references are available providing performance results indicating less than acceptable meter performance when using the conventional 19-tube test bundle.Morrow, T.B., 'Orifice Meter Installation effects in the GRl MRF\\", 3rd International Symposium of Fluid Flow Measurement, San Antonio Tx., March, 1995 The individual results should be reviewed to ascertain details such as beta ratio, meter tube lengths, Re and test conditions. Figure (3) showing Conventional tube bundle performance The general indications are that the conventional tube bundle will cause the orifice installation to over register flow values up to 1.5% when the tube bundle is 1 pipe diameter to approximately 11 pipe diameters from the orifice plate. This is caused by a flat velocity profile that creates higher differential pressures than with a fully developed profile. There is a crossover region from approximately 10 to 15 pipe diameters where the error band is approximately zero. Then a slight under- registration of flows occurs for distances between approximately 15 to 25 pipe diameters. This is due to a peaked velocity profile that creates lower differential pressures than a fully developed profile. At distances greater than 25 pipe diameters the error asymptotes to zero. Fig.(3) showing the Conventional Tube Bundle Performance explaining typical characteristic behavior of the popular 19 tube, tube-bundle. An additional drawback of the conventional 19 tube, tube bundle is variation in sizing. The conventional tube bundle provides errors very much dependent on installation details, that is, the elbows on and out of plane, tees, valves and distances from the last pipe installation to the conditioner and conditioner to the orifice plate. These errors have a great significance. Therefore, the latest findings regarding conventional tube bundle performance should be reviewed prior to meter station design and installation. The final installation option for orifice metering is perforated plate flow conditioners. There is a variety of perforated plates have entered the market. These devices generally are designed to rectify the drawbacks of the conventional tube bundle (accuracy and repeatability insufficiency). The reader is cautioned to review the performance of the chosen perforated plate carefully prior to installation. A flow conditioner performance test guideline should be utilized to determine performance.Morrow T. B., Metering Research Facility Program, \\" Orifice Meter Installations Effects, Development of a Flow Conditioner Performance Test', GRI-9710207. Dec. 1997. The key elements of a flow conditioner test are - # Perform a baseline calibration test with an upstream length of 70 to 100 pipe diameters of straight meter tube. The baseline Coefficient of Discharge values should be within the 95% confidence interval for the RG orifice equation (i.e. the coefficient of discharge equation as provided by AGA-3). # Select values of upstream meter tube length, and flow conditioner location, to be used for the performance evaluation. Install the flow conditioner at the desired location. First, perform a test for either the two 90° elbows out-of-plane installation, or the high swirl installation for beta = 0.40 and for beta = 0.67. This test will show whether the flow conditioner removes swirl from the disturbed flow. If the Delta Cd is within the acceptable region for both values of beta i.e. 0.40 and 0.67, and if the Cd results vary as (beta)^{3.5} , then the conditioner is successful in removing swirl. The tests for the other three installations namely, good flow conditions, partly closed valve and highly disturbed flow) may be performed for beta = 0.67, and the results for other (i ratios predicted from the Delta Cd - (beta)^{3.5} correlation. Otherwise, the tests should be performed for a range of p ratios between 0.20 and 0.75. # Perform test and determine the flow conditioner performance for the flow conditioner installed in good flow conditions, downstream of a half closed valve, and for either the double 90° elbow out-of-plane or the high swirl installation. = Effects of flow conditioning on turbine meter = The turbine meter is available in various manufacturer's configurations of a common theme; turbine blades and rotor configured devices. These devices are designed such that when a gas stream passes through them they will spin proportionally to the amount of gas passing over the blades in a repeatable fashion. Accuracy is then ensured by completion of a calibration, indicating the relationship between rotational speed and volume, at various Reynolds Numbers. The fundamental difference between the orifice meter and the turbine meter is the flow equation derivation. The orifice meter flow calculation is based on fluid flow fundamentals (a 1st Law of Thermodynamics derivation utilizing the pipe diameter and vena contracta diameters for the continuity equation). Deviations from theoretical expectation can be assumed under the Coefficient of Discharge. Thus, one can manufacture an orifice meter of known uncertainty with only the measurement standard in hand and access to a machine shop. The need for flow conditioning, and hence, a fully developed velocity flow profile is driven from the original determination of Cd which utilized fully developed or 'reference profiles' as explained above. Conversely, the turbine meter operation is not rooted deeply in fundamentals of thermodynamics. This is not to say that the turbine meter is in any way an inferior device. There are sound engineering principles providing theoretical background. It is essentially an extremely repeatable device that is then assured accuracy via calibration. The calibration provides the accuracy. It is carried out in good flow conditions (flow conditions free of swirl and a uniform velocity flow profile) this is carried out for every meter manufactured. Deviations from the as-calibrated conditions would be considered installation effects, and the sensitivity of the turbine meter to these installation effects is of interest. The need for flow conditioning is driven from the sensitivity of the meter to deviations from as calibrated conditions of swirl and velocity profile. Generally, recent research indicates that turbine meters are sensitive to swirl but not to the shape of the velocity profile. A uniform velocity profile is recommended, but no strict requirements for fully developed flow profiles are indicated. Also, no significant errors are evident when installing single or dual rotor turbine meters downstream of two elbows out-of-plane without flow conditioning devices.Park J.T., \\"Reynolds Number and Installation Effects on Turbine Meters\\", Fluid Flow Measurement 3r6 International Symposium, March 1995Micklos J.P., \\"Fundamentals of Gas Turbine Meters\\", American School of Gas Measurement Technology 1997 Proceedings p. 35 = Effects of flow conditioning on ultrasonic meter = Figure (5) showing ultrasonic meter sound path - no flow Due to the relative age of the technology, it may be beneficial to discuss the operation of the multipath ultrasonic meter to illustrate the effects of flow profile distortion and swirl. There are various types of flow measurements utilizing high frequency sound. The custody transfer measurement devices available today utilize the time of travel concept. The difference in time of flight with the flow is compared to the time of flight against the flow. This difference is used to infer average flow velocity on the sound path.Stuart J.S., \\"New A,G.A. Report No. 9, Measurement of Gas by Multipath Ultrasonic Gas Meters\\", 1997 Operating Section Proceedings, Nashville, TN., May, 1997 Fig.(5) showing the Ultrasonic Meter sound path no flow which illustrates this concept. Figure (6) showing Ultrasonic meter sound path - uniform velocity profile The resulting flow equation for the mean velocity experienced by the sound path is given by, bar {V}_{flow} = left [ frac{1}{T_{ab}} - frac{1}{T_{ba}} right ]left [ frac{Dist_{Sound path}}{2cos phi} right ] (5) The case of no flow gives the actual path of the sound when there is zero flow (by equating eq.(5) to zero). In case of theoretical flow profile, say a uniform velocity flow profile where the no-slip condition on the pipe walls is not applied, Fig.(6) shows Ultrasonic Meter sound path - uniform velocity profile which illustrates the resultant sound path. A theoretical derivation of the Mean velocity equation for this sound path becomes much more complicated. In case of a perfect fully developed real velocity profile of Ultrasonic meter which is shown in Fig.(7) indicating a possible sound path as a result of an installation in a real flow. Figure (7) showing Ultrasonic meter sound path - fully developed flow Here a mathematical derivation for this Ultrasonic meter is also becomes very complicated. Developing a robust flow algorithm to calculate the mean flow velocity for the sound path can be quite complicated. Now add to this; sound path reflection from the pipe wall, multipaths to add degrees of freedom, swirl and departure from axisymmetric fully developed flow profile and the problem of integrating the actual velocity flow profile to yield volume flow rate can be an accomplishment. Hence the real performance of ultrasonic meters downstream of perturbations, and the need for calibrations is required.Kamik U., Studzinskl W., Geerligs J., Rogi M., \\"Performance Evaluation of 8 Inch Mutipath Ultrasonic Meters\\", A.G.A. operating Section Operations Conference, May, 1997, Nashville TN. = Effects of flow conditioning on Coriolis meter = Coriolis meter shown in fig.(8) is very accurate in single-phase conditions but inaccurate to measure two-phase flows. It poses a complex fluid structure interaction problem in case of two-phase operation. There is a scarcity of theoretical models available to predict the errors reported by Coriolis meter in aforementioned conditions. Figure (8) showing Coriolis meter Flow conditioners make no effect on meter accuracy while using wet gas due to the annular flow regime, which is not highly affected by flow conditioners. In single-phase conditions, Coriolis meter gives accurate measurement even in presence of severe flow disturbances. There is no need for flow conditioning before the meter to obtain accurate readings from it, which would be the case in other metering technologies like orifice and turbine. On the other hand, in two-phase flows, the meter consistently gives negative errors. The use of flow conditioners clearly affects the reading of the meter in aerated liquids. This phenomenon can be used to get fairly accurate estimate of flow rate in low gas volume fraction liquid flows.The effect of flow conditioning on straight tube Coriolis meter = Liquid flow measurement = Flow conditioning makes a huge effect on the accuracy of liquid turbine meter which results in flow disturbances. These effects are mainly caused by debris on strainer screens, for various upstream piping geometries and different types of flow conditioners. The effectiveness of a flow conditioner can be indicated by the following two key measurements: * Percentage variation of an average meter factor over the defined range of flow disturbances for a given flow rate and inlet piping geometry. The lesser the value of percentage variation of an average meter factor over the range of flow disturbances, the better will be the performance of flow conditioner. * Percentage meter factor repeatability for each flow disturbance, at a given flow rate and inlet piping geometry. The lesser the value of percentage meter factor repeatability at a given set of installation/operating conditions, the better will be the performance of flow conditioner.

It is a port of Mozilla Firefox for PowerPC-based Macintosh computers running Mac OS X to retain compatibility with the older architecture and older versions of the operating system, and to add PowerPC- specific optimizations for improved performance. The project was started after Mozilla announced that it would not release Firefox 4 for PowerPC versions of OS X. Like Firefox, it includes compatibility with a wide range of addons, Acid2 and Acid3 compliance, and HTML 5 and CSS 3 features. It also includes JavaScript just-in-time compilation, custom builds for specific PowerPC processor families, and AltiVec acceleration of key media codecs. The primary maintainer is Cameron Kaiser. The project shares administration with Classilla, a fork of Mozilla Application Suite for Mac OS 9 and Mac OS 8.6. History In 2010, Mozilla's Mike Beltzner announced that the forthcoming Firefox 4 would not be released for Power Macintosh computers, compatibility with Mac OS X Tiger having already been removed, making Firefox 3.6 the last supported release of Firefox on the older architecture and platform. Mozilla stopped making PowerPC-compatible universal builds of Firefox 4 with beta 7. In response, developer Cameron Kaiser created a test build of Firefox 4 that could run on his Power Mac G5 at the same time as support was being withdrawn from beta 7. This was released to users in separate builds for AltiVec Macs and G3 Macs on November 8, 2010. Aligning with precedent that modified builds of Firefox source could not use Firefox trademarks without permission, the project was forked and named TenFourFox. A full complement of builds for the G3, the 7400 and 7450 G4 families and the G5 were released with beta 8 on December 15, 2010. JavaScript acceleration using its completed PowerPC version of TraceMonkey was released with beta 9 on January 12, 2011, and enabled fully for beta 11 on February 2, 2011. The finalized first release version, 4.0s, incorporated a security update and a fix for JavaScript performance, and was released on March 24, 2011. Version 5.0 switched to the current Mozilla rapid release framework, based on Firefox 5 and including additional AltiVec scaling and color features, and was released on June 16, 2011. After Mozilla announced the extended support release (ESR) of Firefox, Cameron Kaiser stated that starting with version 10 of TenFourFox, stable releases of TenFourFox will be based on Firefox ESR to reduce maintenance burden. Between major ESR versions, developers tracked changes in Firefox's 6-week rapid release cycle with test builds only to determine whether or not they would still be able to build the software after the next ESR version was released. Only minor ESR updates were advertised as suitable for general consumption. In December 2015, Kaiser declared TenFourFox would move away directly from Firefox source code with 45 ESR, citing an inability to port later versions due to operating system and Rust compiler limitations. The first of the \\"Feature Parity Releases,\\" or FPRs, in which major later Firefox features were backported to TenFourFox's modified Firefox ESR 45 base, was released after the official end of Firefox ESR 45 support on June 13, 2017. The TenFourFox FPR series of releases include additional later features as well as backported security patches from the most current supported Firefox ESR. Features TenFourFox shares its main feature set with Firefox along with optimizations for the PowerPC platform. Similar to other optimized build projects such as Pale Moon and Swiftfox, TenFourFox includes specific compiler optimizations to improve its overall performance and issues specific builds tuned for specific processor families. However, it also includes custom new features, in particular its JavaScript just-in-time compilation backend and AltiVec acceleration, and adds glue code to enable interface features from Firefox 4 and later to still work on Mac OS X Tiger. This has led to favorable reviews on its speed and performance on older Macintosh computers. Due to its compatibility with the older operating system, the browser lacks the bloated feature set of current Firefox versions. In particular, it does not fully support Core Text, so it does not understand Apple Advanced Typography features in certain international fonts; it does not support graphics acceleration for compositing; and it does not support WebGL (because PowerPC Tiger does not support OpenGL 2). Furthermore, for security and maintainability reasons, NPAPI plugins support is deprecated, and has been subsequently removed.

Named in honor of Saint Patrick, it is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. It was founded December 1869.Archdiocese of Philadelphia  History  Kennett Square area Catholics attended Mass at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Delaware up until the mid-1800s. The Diocese of Wilmington was formed in the late 1860s, leaving Kennett Square area Catholics without a church within their own diocese. Father John Wall, a missionary from Saint Thomas the Apostle Church in Delaware County collected funding and erected the original St. Patrick Church on South State Street. It was the first Catholic parish in southern Chester County. The first Mass was celebrated on Christmas Day of 1869. and on September 1, 1872, Archbishop Wood dedicated the church. The building was in use for over 35 years, eventually replaced by the present building on Meredith Street which was consecrated in 1907.  Interior  = Stained glass windows = The stained glass windows of St. Patrick were imported from Munich, Germany. They number five on either side of the building with a triple-window facing Meredith Street. The subjects of the windows were chosen by Father John H. O'Donel and are as follows:Stained Glass Windows * The Christ Child in the carpenter shop of his foster father * The symbols of the Four Evangelists, two on either side of the main entrance: St. Matthew with an angel, St. Mark with a lion, St. Luke with an ox, and St. John with an eagle. * St. Joseph holding lilies * St. Patrick * St. Margaret, Queen of Scotland * St. Agnes * The Blessed Virgin = Pews = The pews of St. Patrick are constructed of solid red oak. It is estimated that to duplicate a single pew today would cost thousands of dollars.  School  St. Patrick School was the parochial school of the St. Patrick parish. Formed in 1922, the original school was staffed by the Sisters of St. Joseph. Later, the school taught grades 1 through 8 and offered kindergarten and preschool programs as well. The school closed in 2012, part of a massive reorganization effort in the archdiocese.

Owned by Spotify since 2014, the company is based in Somerville, MA. The Echo Nest began as a research spin-off from the MIT Media Lab to understand the audio and textual content of recorded music. Its creators intended it to perform music identification, recommendation, playlist creation, audio fingerprinting, and analysis for consumers and developers. History The Echo Nest was founded in 2005 from the dissertation work of Tristan Jehan and Brian Whitman at the MIT Media Lab. In October 2010, The Echo Nest received a $7 million venture financing from Matrix Partners and Commonwealth Capital Ventures. In July 2012 The Echo Nest received a $17.3 million Series D venture financing from Norwest Venture Partners, Matrix Partners, Commonwealth Capital Ventures and Jim Pallotta. In March 2014, The Echo Nest was acquired by Spotify for 49.7 million euro, consisting cash and Spotify's equity.  Products  The Echo Nest's product line was based on their automatically derived database of data about 30 million songs aggregated from web crawling, data mining, and digital signal processing techniques. The company also made its data available to developers via an API used by over 7,000 developers to build independent music applications. The API was shut down on May 31, 2016, and developers were encouraged to use the Spotify API instead.Important API Announcement, March 29th 2016 The Echo Nest released data on 1 million songs for research purposes. The company was a co-organizer of Music Hack Day. In June 2011, the company released Echoprint, an open source and open data acoustic fingerprinting library.  Clients  The data powered music solutions for customers such as MTV, Island Def Jam, BBC, MOG, Warner Music Group, eMusic, Spotify, Rdio, Clear Channel, VEVO, Nokia, SiriusXMhttps://blog.echonest.com/post/48040487056/mysxm and Thumbplay.  Spotify  The Echo Nest was acquired on March 6, 2014, by music streaming service Spotify. The music intelligence agency functions to help Spotify curate personalized music recommendations that are driven by algorithms. The Echo Nest is the driving force behind the playlists professionally curated on Spotify. To generate individualized Discover Weekly playlists as well as recommend suggestions in the ‘Discover’ section of Spotify's home page, individualized for every subscriber, the Echo Nest collects data on a user's listening habits and uses it to predict what music they will enjoy the most. The Echo Nest has created Taste Profiles based on the listening patterns they notice about a user. Taste Profiles are an amalgamation of taste clusters of genres and subgenres. Taste Profiles and clusters are not publicly available for individual users to access but have been released to journalists and researchers. One Echo Nest employee has created a categorical perception spectrum of genres and subgenres based on “an algorithmically-generated, readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical genre-space, based on data tracked and analyzed for 4,341 genre-shaped distinctions by Spotify” called Every Noise At Once. The Echo Nest has also created an internal tool for Spotify and Echo Nest employees called The Truffle Pig, which is used in Spotify to curate mood and occasion specific playlists. The Truffle Pig is a sonically advanced search engine that can be asked to search for songs based on adjectives or feelings. The search can also be redacted for particular qualities to produce higher levels of specificity. Playlists curated by Spotify are available for public access. They are created in part by the algorithms associated with The Truffle Pig and in part by the music experts employed by Spotify. To create these playlists, one of Spotify's thirty-two resident music experts will use the Truffle Pig search engine to find songs associated with a quality or theme. From the search results, the employee can hand pick songs perfect for any playlist. These playlists include “Your Favorite Coffeehouse” and “TGIF”.

Early life in England and work in India Conybeare was born at Brislington (now a suburb of Bristol), Somerset.Arthur L. Humphreys: \\"The Somerset Roll: An Experimental List of Worthies, Unworthies and Villains Born in the County\\", London, Strangeways, 1897 He was the fourth son of William Daniel Conybeare, the eminent geologist and Dean of Llandaff, and the great-grandson of John Conybeare, Bishop of Bristol.

The tower of the Afghan Church, Colaba, MumbaiMeanwhile, his interest in Gothic architecture led him in 1847 to submit plans for the construction of the Afghan Church in Colaba. The architect originally selected, John Macduff Derick, had already presented his designs to the authorities, but they decided in June 1845 that these were unfit for purpose and the building would cost too much. Conybeare's designs were chosen instead, and the church was eventually consecrated in 1858. The reredos, the Afghan War Memorial mosaics, and the tiles, pews and screen were designed by William Butterfield.Paul Thompson: \\"William Butterfield\\", Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1971, p.450 In 1852, Conybeare produced an influential report to the Bombay Board of Conservancy entitled \\"Report on the Sanitary State and Sanitary Requirements of Bombay\\".

Sutherland was a friend of Robert Thompson Crawshay of the nearby Cyfarthfa Ironworks, and the viaduct was built on a curve to satisfy conditions laid down by the Crawshay Estate.Merthyr Tydfil Heritage Regeneration Trust. Heritage Plaques (Places): Cefn Coed or Pontycapel Viaduct Ecclesiastical work in Britain While working on the above railway schemes, Conybeare continued to promote Gothic architecture. He was involved in plans for three churches and published a book on church design. St Mary seen from the eastThe first of the three churches, and the only one that exists today, was St Mary's Church, Itchen Stoke, Hampshire (1866), designed by Conybeare at the request of the incumbent, his brother Charles Ranken Conybeare. Its design was influenced by the thirteenth-century Gothic Sainte Chapelle in Paris. The second church, St Matthias's Church, Warwick Road, Kensington, was originally built in 1869–72 to the designs of John Henry Hakewill (1811–1880), the son of Henry Hakewill. Conybeare made substantial alterations to the church in 1873, probably at his own expense, and also built an adjacent school which was replaced in the 1890s. St Matthias survived until 1958, when it was demolished.St. Matthias's Church, Warwick Road and St. Patrick's Church, Kenway Road, From: British History Online – 'Churches and chapels: Church of England', Survey of London: volume 42: Kensington Square to Earl's Court (1986), pp. 368–386. Date accessed: 10 April 2011. The third church, St Patrick, Kenway Road, was never built. The book, published in 1868, was entitled The Ten Canons of Proportion and Composition in Gothic Architecture … Practically Applied to the Design of Modern Churches. It was intended to be the first in a series on Gothic architecture, but not many copies were sold and no further volumes were published. Final years Conybeare gave up his London architectural practice in 1870 and is believed to have emigrated to Venezuela in 1878, dying in Caracas in 1884.

Before the outbreak of the war he was given command of the 1st Battle Cruiser Squadron (1911–1912) and of the 3rd Battle Squadron (1913–1914). =First World War= During the early months of the First World War he commanded the 1st Battle Squadron and was in command of the rescue operation when the modern battleship HMS Audacious was mined and sunk in October 1914. In December 1914 he was appointed to command the Channel Fleet flying his flag in HMS Lord Nelson. Under the command of Bayly, the 5th Battle Squadron spent 31 December participating in gunnery exercises off the Isle of Portland, supported by the Topaze class light cruisers HMS Topaze and HMS Diamond. After the exercises, that night the fleet remained at sea on patrol even though submarine activity had been reported in the area. With rough sea conditions and the wind increasing, submarine attacks would have been difficult to carry out effectively and so were not thought to be a significant threat. Nonetheless the pre-dreadnought battleship HMS Formidable was hit and sunk by SM U-24. Bayly was later criticized for not taking proper precautions during the exercises, but was cleared of the charge of negligence. In January 1915 he was made President of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. In July 1916 he was made Senior Officer on the Coast of Ireland at Queenstown. In 1917 the title became Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland. He held this post until 1919. In this function Bayly was tasked with keeping the approaches to Britain safe from U-boats attacks. In 1917, Bayly, promoted to admiral, was given command of a mixed British-American force defending the Western approaches. He took as his chief-of-staff the American captain Joel R. P. Pringle. Bayly had a good working relation with his U.S. counterpart William Sims.See 'Castles of Steel.' Admiral Bayly retired in 1919. He died in London in 1938.

Plot summary  John Arthur Lennox is an underworld chieftain who runs a nightclub where society patrons come to rub elbows with the criminal set. He is nicknamed Silk because of his fondness for the expression that things are \\"fine as silk\\". From the club he directs a violent $50,000 bank heist and cheekily invites in two detectives to establish his alibi. While the robbery is going on, he gets his new singer Jimmy Lambert to play a recording over the intercom that makes it appear as if his men are on the premises. When Deacon, the gangster holding the stolen money, tries to skip town, Silk has him killed at the train station. The money is not found on his body, but the gang suspects that it is hidden in the express office. Meanwhile, Jimmy has realised that the recording will help convict Silk of the robbery and with Nola, the dance partner in his act, plans to use it against him. As the law closes in and his allies turn against him, Silk is arrested but has to be released when witnesses, afraid of reprisals, refuse to identify him. In the police line-up, Silk meets Fingers Smalley, who agrees to break open the express office safe. After establishing an alibi at the club, Silk and Fingers leave for the office, but the police arrive as Fingers opens the safe.

Taurus, London, page 140, Barisha is located in Harem District of Idlib Governorate in the Ala Mountains near the Syrian border with Turkey. It is in the central region of the northern Syrian limestone massif, about from Qalb Loze across a valley. The karst topography of the limestone left many small caves, some of which were habitations. Barish is located on the site of an ancient settlement, Dayhis. There are early Byzantine period ruins including residential buildings, cisterns, olive presses, and a church in the village.Strube, Christine (1993) \\"Baudekoration im Nordsyrischen Kalksteinmassiv Vol. II.

The ruins are surrounded by olive groves and small plots of mostly wheat.  Location  The place is located in the Idlib Governorate on the eponymous ridge, the Jebel Barischa, in the central area of the northern Syrian limestone massif. The road in a northerly direction after one kilometer at the junction towards Dahis over and reached after four kilometers at an intersection, the small village of Ras al-Hosn, after two more kilometers, the early Byzantine neighboring towns Baqirha and Deir Qeita. From here it is another eight kilometers east to the junction with the Aleppo road at the Syrian-Turkish border crossing Bal al-Hawa. The most famous place in the region is Qalb Loze, which is eight kilometers west, separated from Barischa by a valley on the also running in a north-south direction Jebel il- Ala. Other ancient ruins can be found nearby. To the south, the road leads over Deir Seita to Idlib. From the modern village without infrastructure the ruin field can be seen half a kilometer to the north. It lies on a flat slope beyond a valley in the midst of olive groves and cereal fields in small plots, which are separated by reading stone walls. The ancient remains of the wall are partly grown in bushes.  Townscape  The cultivation of olives and wine was the heyday of the town from the 4th to the 6th century. In Barischa, in comparison to other dead cities, an above-average number of olive presses have been preserved. There were in the center of the village in the area of the church some stately two-storey buildings, which are referred to as residences and on one side a pillar portico was introduced. Striking is the high number of smaller and very simple residential buildings with rectangular plain windows without portico, whose upright walls are made of huge stone blocks. Barischa, unlike most of the dead cities was archaeologically studied late and is therefore little known in the general literature. The first thorough examination of the 6th-century church was made by Christine Strube in the 1970s. The only church built by a local workshop is a three-naved basilica with a rectangular chancel to the east flanked by lateral adjoining rooms. It has a straight eastern wall. This combination is a development of the late 5th century. The northern side room was accessible from the side aisle by a door whose framing consists of bands in the bas-relief. Only the rock is more elaborate by a wavy band with foliage. Because of the door, this room can be identified as Diakonikon, the southern adjoining room being connected to the nave by a wider arch, as is typical for the Martyrion (relic chamber). In the completely preserved eastern wall of the gable, there are four windows with curved lintels framed by slight relief at the same height. In contrast, the decorative band at the cornice is defined by a deep groove. As water reservoirs for the dry season served in many places caves in the karstic rocks, which are recognizable only at Schöpföffnungen in the ground. In Barischa, a cistern carved out of the massive limestone subsoil with above- ground vaults has been preserved. The inside dimensions are about 4 × 6.5 meters. To the bottom of the approximately eight-meter deep cistern, a monolithic stone staircase leads down the wall. The vertex of the vault is three meters above the terrain.

History Highlandlake was founded in 1871 by Lorin C. Mead.

After taking a stage to Greeley, where he found that the best land was already taken up, he returned by stage to Longmont. On the way the stage passed a prairie pothole. Standing near the edge of the water was an antelope. Lorin was taken with the area and upon his return to Longmont, filed on the land around the pothole which he named Highland Lake. He named the town that eventually grew up around the lake, Highlandlake (which at times can be quite confusing to many people) after the lake in Sir Walter Scott's book,\\"The Lady of the Lake.\\" In 1906, the much anticipated railroad bypassed the town of Highlandlake.

The Wind Cave bison herd is a herd of 250–400 American bison in Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, USA. It is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are the Yellowstone Park bison herd, the Henry Mountains bison herd in Central Utah, and at Elk Island National Park in Alberta, Canada. The Wind Cave herd are of the Plains bison subspecies (Bison bison bison). History The American bison (Bison bison) once numbered in the millions, perhaps between 25 million and 60 million by some estimates, and they were possibly the most numerous large land animal on earth. However, they were hunted to near extinction throughout North America by the late 1880s. The Wind Cave bison herd was started with 14 bison from the New York Zoological Society and with six animals transplanted from the Yellowstone Park bison herd. In addition, in the 1960s, one single bull bison was received from Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd was the last free-ranging bison herd in the United States and the only place where they did not go locally extinct, so they have become at least part of the foundation stock for many other herds, including the Wind Cave bison herd. The Wind Cave population has, in turn, served as the foundation stock for the Tallgrass Prairie bison herd in Kansas.http://www.nps.gov/tapr/naturescience/upload/TAPRBisonFact2012.pdf Ecology Wind Cave National Park has large areas of grassland prairie and this provides a nearly optimum environment for American bison. Bison are large herd animals that defend their young vigorously. American bison can run up to per hour and are surprisingly agile, in addition to their notable strength and irritable temperament. However, there are limited numbers of potential apex predators of these bison. Significant apex predators that could help control the bison population would include brown bear, grizzly bear, and wolves, and these are currently absent from the area. Wind Cave National Park by itself, at 33,847 acres, might not be large enough for a viable population of predators; however it is part of a much larger area of extended grassland prairie. Other large mammals found in the area include elk, coyotes, bobcats, deer, and pronghorn. Competitive pressure from the other large grazing mammals in Wind Cave National Park might also help limit the number of bison in the herd, but this is not considered to have a significant effect on bison numbers. Genetics The Wind Cave bison herd is considered to be genetically pure, meaning that there is no evidence of significant hybridization between these bison and cattle. Most private and public bison herds in the United States are not genetically pure. Genetic testing shows that there now appear to be some cattle genes present in approximately 95% of the bison surveyed in other areas.http://www.buffalofieldcampaign.org/habitat/documents2/Derr_American%20Bison%20-%20The%20Ultimate%20Genetic%20Survivor.pdf Though the American bison (Species: Bison bison) is not only a separate species, but a member of a separate genus from domestic cattle (Bos primigenius), they are genetically compatible and American bison can interbreed freely with cattle. Crossbreeds tend to look very much like purebred bison, so appearance is unreliable as a means of determining what is a purebred bison and what is a crossbred cow. Many ranchers deliberately crossbred their bison with cattle, and it would also be expected that there could be some natural hybridization in areas where cattle and bison occur in the same range. Since cattle and bison eat similar food and tolerate similar conditions, they have often been in the same range together in the past, and opportunity for cross breeding may have been common. Most bison today are descendants of five herds that were conserved during the near-extinction event of the late 19th century. These herds were subject to cattle crossbreeding experiments and as a result cattle genes are found throughout most bison populations. In recent decades tests were developed to determine the source of mitochondrial DNA in cattle and bison, and it was found that most private 'buffalo' herds were actually crossbred with cattle, and even most state and federal buffalo herds had some cattle DNA. With the advent of nuclear microsatellite DNA testing, the number of herds that are known to contain cattle genes has increased. Though approximately 500,000 bison exist on private ranches and in public herds, perhaps only 15,000 to 25,000 of these bison are pure and are not actually bison-cattle hybrids. Significant public bison herds that do not appear to have hybridized domestic cattle genes are the Yellowstone Park bison herd, the Henry Mountains bison herd, which was started with bison taken from Yellowstone Park, the Wind Cave bison herd, and the Wood Buffalo National Park bison herd in Canada and herds derived from it. A landmark study of bison genetics was undertaken by James Derr of Texas A&M; University in an attempt to determine what genetic problems bison might face as they repopulate former areas. It concluded that bison seem to be doing quite well, despite their apparent genetic bottleneck. All of the state-owned bison herds tested contained animals with domestic cattle mitochondrial DNA, with the possible exception of the Henry Mountains bison herd of Utah. Most national herds, except Wind Cave and Yellowstone, also appear to be hybridized. As genetic testing improves, it may be discovered that almost all bison have some level of genetic inheritance from domestic cattle. A separate study by Wilson and Strobeck, published in Genome, was done to define the relationships between different herds of bison in the United States and Canada, and to determine whether the bison at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada and the Yellowstone Park bison herd were possibly separate subspecies, and not plains bison. Some people had suggested that the Yellowstone Park bison were actually either of the 'athabascae' (wood buffalo) subspecies, or else that they were of an unspecified 'mountain' subspecies. In the study, it was determined that the Wood Buffalo Park bison were actually cross breeds between plains bison and wood bison, but that their predominant genetic makeup was truly that of the expected \\"wood buffalo\\" (Bison bison athabascae). However, the Yellowstone Park bison herd were pure plains bison (Bison bison bison), and not any of the other previously suggested subspecies. This is significant for the Wind Cave bison herd, since this herd was founded, in part, with animals from the Yellowstone Park bison herd. The bison in Wind Cave National park were also plains bison, as expected. Future Bison grazing on prairie grasses American bison became extinct over almost their entire former range by 1890, with only the Yellowstone National Park bison remaining free and in their natural environment, in the United States. Even that herd was reduced to only a few dozen individuals, so concerns about a genetic bottleneck are significant. Now bison number approximately 500,000, but most of these are bison-cattle hybrids, and are contained in private herds, for ranching and meat purposes, rather than roaming the plains by the millions, as they did previously. Some herds, such as the Wind Cave bison herd are free, but their range is restricted and the re-establishment of large bison populations is not assured. Considering these factors, there remain various questions and concerns regarding future management of the Wind Cave Bison Herd. With their genetic purity and the healthy condition of the Wind Cave bison, they should have a significant role to play in the re- establishment of bison populations. Private groups, as well as governmental entities in the United States and Canada, are making efforts to return Bison to much of their previous natural range. In moving bison to new locations, great care should be taken to maintain their genetic diversity, to ensure that valuable genes are not irrevocably lost. Care should also be taken when dealing with any already existing herd, to try to minimize the introduction of domestic cattle genes, which appear to be carried by many bison, into herds where such genes are not currently present. The Wind Cave bison could contribute to this process. However, a special risk to the Wind Cave bison herd is the potential for the loss of their genetic purity. The herd is one of the few bison herds in the nation that does not seem to contain hybridized genes from domestic cattle. Unfortunately, the bison herd at Custer State Park, only a few miles away, does include herd members that have hybridized cattle genes. Furthermore, bison from Custer State Park have been found wandering within Wind Cave National Park. No evidence of cross breeding with these bison has yet been found, but many biologists feel that extra care should be taken with these animals in the future. Unlike the Yellowstone Park bison herd, the Wind Cave bison herd is currently brucellosis-free. Though brucellosis doesn't seem to cause significant problems for bison populations, it is used as a reason for keeping bison inside the Yellowstone National Park and one of the reasons the state of Montana allows hunting of the Yellowstone Bison if they leave the park. Since the Wind Cave herd does not have brucellosis, there is less reason to confine them to the park and less reason to hunt them. Therefore, it should be easier to allow them to increase their population and their range, if other, nearby land areas become available for bison.

Rome had previously hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics. The bid for the 2020 Games was withdrawn due to the lack of support from the Italian government. History Rome's Via Veneto at night The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) announced the selection of Rome as Italy's candidate city on May 19, 2010. Rome was selected ahead of Venice which was deemed unable to fulfill requirements set by the IOC for hosting the Games; among other things, it relied too heavily on venues outside the city, including in Treviso and Padua. The initial Rome proposal included a $61 million bid budget and a plan to utilize 70 percent of existing venues. Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo, who ran the 1990 FIFA World Cup, was asked to lead the bid committee, but turned down the offer. Entrepreneur Nerio Alessandri was also offered the job but he too declined. IOC vice president Mario Pescante was chosen instead. His appointment was cleared by the IOC Ethics Committee, which found no conflict of interest. In an interview with media outlet Around the Rings, Pescante acknowledged competition from other potential bid cities, particularly emphasizing Tokyo's bid. In a September 2011 interview, IOC President Jacques Rogge defended Rome's and Madrid's ability to host the 2020 Olympics in spite of the ongoing eurozone debt crisis. He pointed out that both cities already had a lot of venues in place and not much would need to be built. He continued by saying that, at the very most, some venues would need to be upgraded but that both cities had the necessary infrastructure to host the Games. Rome's bid was given full backing by the Italian government on February 22, 2011. The bid had an initial budget of €31 million. The chairman of the bid committee, Mario Pescante, stated that he hoped Rome's bid could serve as \\"a blueprint for a return to fiscal responsibility and real sustainability in the Olympic bidding process\\". On October 3, 2011, Rome 2020 announced that they had hired marketing firm Helios Partners as a consultant for their bid. The firm had a track record of assisting in the successful bids of several Olympic host cities. (Two months after Rome withdrew their bid, Helios Partners was signed as a consultant to Baku's 2020 bid.) On October 11, 2011, the bid committee hired Coni Servizi Engineering and Consulting as their lead technical partner with the remit of assisting the bid committee with their venue master plan. In November 2011, \\"GiovaniRoma2020\\" (YouthRome2020) was launched to help promote the bid as well as promoting youth olympic education. The following month, the bid received the support of the country's environment ministry; Environment Minister Corrado Clini stated that the bid needed to be environmentally sustainable to boost its chances of success. The bid was also supported by Italy's Chamber of Deputies. In January 2012, the Rome 2020 bid committee estimated that the cost of organizing the Games would be €9.8 billion but hosting the Games would lead to a growth of €17.7 billion (a 1.4% increase) in Italian GDP, with the creation of 29,000 jobs. The public cost would be €4.6 billion and hosting the Games would bring in €4.6 billion in tax revenue. By January 2012, there was high public support for the bid amongst Italian citizens, with 74% of Italians supporting the bid and 77% of Rome residents in support. Of those polled who supported the bid, 70% were in favor because they believed that hosting the Olympics would create economic benefits and jobs. On February 14, 2012, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called an end to the bid, citing uncertain costs and unknown financial benefit. The announcement came a day before the deadline for applicant cities to submit the application files. =Outlook, conclusion and future= After Rome's bid for the 2020 Games was abandoned, there was talk about the city potentially bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics.Italian Olympic President hints at Rome 2024 Olympic bid Rome did put in a bid for the 2024 Games but in September 2016 this bid was also cancelled, mainly for cost reasons and because of the huge infrastructure changes that the city would have to endure. Tokyo was ultimately elected as the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Previous bids Rome first bid for the 1908 Summer Olympics and was ultimately awarded the games. However the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906 forced Italy to return the hosting rights to the IOC. The IOC transferred the 1908 Games to London. Rome later bid for the 1924 Summer Olympics but lost to Paris. They then bid for the 1936 Games but lost to Berlin. They bid for the 1944 Summer Olympics which were awarded to London, then cancelled due to World War II. Rome successfully bid for the 1960 Summer Olympics. The city had previously bid for the 2004 Summer Olympics, where it was shortlisted as a candidate city but lost to Athens in the final round of voting. =Previous bids from other Italian cities= Milan bid for the 1908 Summer Olympics but was defeated by London and also for 2000 Summer Olympics but then withdrew eventually. Italy has made multiple bids for the Winter Olympics. Cortina d'Ampezzo successfully bid for the 1944 Winter Olympics but these games were cancelled due to World War II. Cortina d'Ampezzo bid for the 1952 Winter Olympics but lost to Oslo. They successfully bid to host the 1956 Winter Olympics. They later bid for the 1988 and 1992 Winter Games but lost to Calgary and Albertville respectively. Aosta bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics but lost to Nagano. Tarvisio bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics but failed to become a candidate city. These games were ultimately awarded to Salt Lake City. Turin successfully bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympics. Overview The year 2020 coincides with the sesquicentennial (150th) anniversary of the declaration of Rome as the capital of united Italy. Among the main goals highlighted in the bid's vision was environmental sustainability through efficient use of energy and the optimization of existing facilities. Hosting the games would have facilitated urban renewal in the Tiber River Park (Parco Fluviale del Tevere), the construction of Tor Vergata Sports City (Città dello Sport di Tor Vergata), and the upgrade of transport infrastructure in the city, including the airport. The bid committee estimated a 20 percent rise in incoming tourists, with 3 million spectators expected. The games were projected to reach a global audience of 4 billion. =Venues= Rome's Foro Italico sports complex Rome's bid relied mainly on existing venues, most of which were used when Rome hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics. The bid consisted of two poles: the Olympic Park in the north and the Fiera di Roma in the southwest. The Olympic village would have been located near downtown. The Olympic Park was to be located at the existing Foro Italico sports complex and would have consisted of the centerpiece Stadio Olimpico, a newly built 10,500-seat tennis stadium, and the outdoor aquatics venues used for the 2009 World Aquatics Championships. The Stadio Olimpico would have hosted athletics events and the men's football final. The Stadio Flaminio most likely would have hosted rugby sevens and the women's football final. Other existing venues included the Piazza di Siena for horse jumping, the Circus Maximus for beach volleyball, the Acqua Acetosa for modern pentathlon, hockey, and archery, the Olgiata for golf, and the Settebagni for canoeing, rowing, and canoe slalom. The Tor di Quinto area was chosen to house the IBC and MPC. After the 2020 Games, the reconstructed area was to be known as the Tiber River Park, which would have included 40 hectares of green space along the Tiber. The Fiera di Roma was expected to host badminton, cycling, gymnastics, judo, wrestling, handball, boxing, fencing, weightlifting, taekwondo, and table tennis. The Tor Vergata, located in the outskirts, would have consisted of two newly constructed venues for hosting volleyball, gymnastics, trampoline, and the basketball finals. Other venues included the Lunghezza for shooting and the Pratoni del Vivaro for mountain biking. Preliminary football rounds were to be held in other cities as well.

He changed positions, from center fielder to pitcher, following the 2016 season. He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays and the Detroit Tigers. Early life Gose attended Bellflower High School in Bellflower, California. In his senior year, he had a .443 batting average, a .618 on-base percentage, and 31 stolen bases for the school's baseball team. He pitched for the team as well, throwing as fast as . Gose also competed in track and field. He ran the 100 and 200 meter races, and the 4 × 100 and 4 × 400 metres relays. He also attended the Major League Baseball Urban Youth Academy in Compton, California. He received a scholarship to attend the University of Arizona to play college baseball with the Arizona Wildcats. Career =Philadelphia Phillies= The Philadelphia Phillies drafted Gose in the second round, with the 51st overall selection, of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft. He opted to sign with the Phillies, forgoing his college scholarship for a $772,000 signing bonus. Playing for the Lakewood BlueClaws of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) in 2009, he appeared in the SAL All-Star Game. His 76 stolen bases that season led all of minor league baseball. Gose began the 2010 season with the Clearwater Threshers of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL). He batted .263 with 4 home runs, 20 runs batted in (RBIs), 17 doubles, and 11 triples. =Toronto Blue Jays= On July 29, 2010, Gose, along with J. A. Happ and Jonathan Villar, was traded to the Houston Astros in exchange for Roy Oswalt and $12 million. Immediately after, he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for first baseman Brett Wallace. The Blue Jays had attempted to acquire Gose from the Phillies before, including in the Roy Halladay trade. They assigned him to the Dunedin Blue Jays of the FSL. Gose was ranked by MLB.com in 2011 as the Blue Jays fifth- best prospect in the organization. In 2011, he played for the New Hampshire Fisher Cats of the Double-A Eastern League (EL). The Fisher Cats were EL champions and Gose scored the winning run in the championship game. He broke Darin Mastroianni's record for stolen bases in one season, finishing with 70 stolen bases and getting caught 15 times. He also hit 15 home runs. During the 2011–12 offseason, he played in the Venezuelan Winter League, batting .182 in 18 games. Prior to the 2012 season, he was ranked as the 39th-best prospect in baseball. Gose started the 2012 season with the Las Vegas 51s of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. He was named to appear in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game. In Triple-A in 2012, Gose had a .286 average with 5 home runs, 21 doubles, 10 triples, and 43 runs batted in. Gose played in 106 games in the 2013 season for Buffalo in the International League, finishing with a .239 average, 3 home runs, and 27 RBIs in 393 at bats, along with 22 stolen bases in 35 attempts. Major league career Toronto Blue Jays in 2012 On July 17, 2012, Gose was called up to the Blue Jays to replace the injured José Bautista. Gose made his MLB debut that day, against the New York Yankees. Gose collected his first Major League hit on a bunt single in the ninth inning off of Clay Rapada. Gose made his first Major League start on July 18, playing right field and batting leadoff, going 0-for-3 with 2 strikeouts. Gose was returned to Triple-A on August 25 when Brandon Morrow returned from the disabled list. Gose was recalled by the Jays on September 4 when major league rosters expanded, and the Triple-A season ended. In a game on September 8, against the Boston Red Sox, Gose hit his first career home run, a three run shot off reliever Andrew Bailey. Gose played in 56 games in the 2012 season, finishing with a .223 average, 1 home run, and 11 RBIs in 166 at bats, along with 15 stolen bases. Gose was optioned to the Blue Jays' new Triple-A affiliate Buffalo Bisons on March 25, 2013. He was recalled by the Blue Jays on May 20. Mickey Storey was optioned to make room on the 25-man roster for Gose. Gose was optioned back to the Bisons on June 6. He was recalled on August 16. Gose played in 52 games in the 2013 season, finishing with a .259 average, .283 on base percentage, 2 home runs, and 12 RBIs in 147 at bats, along with 4 stolen bases in 7 attempts. Gose was optioned to the Bisons on March 24, 2014. Gose was up and down between Buffalo and Toronto for much of the 2014 season. After hitting .234 with one home run and 14 stolen bases with the big league team, Gose was optioned back to Buffalo on August 15 to make room for the returning Edwin Encarnación. He was brought back to the Blue Jays on September 1, as part of the September roster expansion. =Detroit Tigers= On November 12, 2014, Gose was traded to the Detroit Tigers for second baseman Devon Travis. In the 2015 season, he served as the Tigers primary centerfielder, playing in 140 games, and hit .254 with 23 stolen bases. On May 16, 2016, Gose was optioned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. Prior to being sent down, Gose batted .209 with two home runs and seven RBIs in 30 games for Detroit. On July 9, 2016, Gose engaged in a dugout incident with Triple-A manager Lloyd McClendon. During the first game of a doubleheader, McClendon appeared to be giving \\"constructive criticism\\" to Gose, who responded in a negative fashion to these comments and allegedly swore at his manager. Gose was promptly sent home and did not play the remainder of the first game nor any of the second game. On July 10, 2016, Gose refused to show up for the game and had cleared out his locker. On July 13, 2016, the Tigers decided they would demote Gose to their Double-A affiliate following a three-day suspension. \\"After collectively evaluating the situation in Toledo, we spoke with Anthony and emphasized our organization's expectations of him,\\" said Tigers general manager Al Avila. \\"Most importantly, Anthony's transfer to Erie is a move to give him a fresh start to his overall performance as he works his way back to Detroit.\\" The Tigers designated Gose for assignment on January 18, 2017 to make room for Mikie Mahtook on the roster. On January 25, 2017, Gose cleared waivers and was outrighted to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. On March 26, 2017, after sending Gose down to minor league camp, the Tigers announced that they would try to convert him into a pitcher after he came to them with the idea. Gose made his pitching debut on May 22 with the Lakeland Flying Tigers of the FSL, pitching an inning and reaching . He elected free agency on November 6, 2017. =Texas Rangers= On November 30, 2017, Gose signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers.

The image sensing circuitry may be implemented using charge-coupled devices, active pixel sensor circuits, or any other light sensing mechanism. The image processing circuitry may be implemented using analog, digital, or mixed signal (analog and digital) circuitry. One area of research is the use of neuromorphic engineering techniques to implement processing circuits inspired by biological neural systems. The output of a vision chip is generally a partially processed image or a high-level information signal revealing something about the observed scene. Although there is no standard definition of a vision chip, the processing performed may comprise anything from processing individual pixel values to performing complex image processing functions and outputting a single value or yes/no signal based on the scene.

He was drafted 11th overall by the BC Lions in the 2011 CFL Draft. In the Canadian Football League’s Amateur Scouting Bureau final rankings, he was ranked as the eighth best player for players eligible in the 2011 draft, and fifth by players in the CIS. He played CIS football with the Alberta Golden Bears. Professional career =BC Lions= O'Neill was drafted in the second round and 11th overall by the BC Lions in the 2011 CFL Draft and was signed by the team on May 30, 2011.https://www.cfl.ca/article/lions-lock-up-draft-class-of-2011 Lions lock up draft class of 2011 His first two years with the BC Lions were spent on the injured list, a conventional way in the CFL to hide players from the salary cap while keeping the player protected from poaching by other teams. In his third year (2013 season) the team restructured the contract of the incumbent Paul McCallum so that O'Neill and McCallum could share the role. In the first exhibition game of that season in Calgary, he kicked five field goals, including a 47-yard attempt in the driving rain that went in off the crossbar to win the game with less than a minute left. He played the second exhibition game as well when McCallum picked up a last-minute injury in the pregame warm up, but got no field attempts in that game. McCallum's injury was serious enough to keep him out of the first regular season game, so on June 28, 2013, O'Neill suited up for his first regular season game. On August 16, 2013, entering Week 8 of the 2013 CFL season, the Lions released O'Neill due to a contract dispute.Released by the Lions =Edmonton Eskimos= On August 19, 2013, he was signed by his hometown Edmonton Eskimos.Esks sign Hugh O'Neill For the next game he was assigned to do the field goal kicking, with incumbent Grant Shaw handling the punting and kickoffs.

He returned to the Eskimos in 2014, but remained off the game day roster to begin the season as Shaw had won all three kicking duties. Following an injury to Shaw in the Labour Day Classic on September 1, 2014, O'Neill took over placekicking, punting, and kickoffs for the rest of the season, playing in eight regular season games and both Eskimos' playoff games.

The election was caused by the resignation of Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Charles Leslie Hale for reasons of ill health. Hale had been an MP in the town since the 1945 general election. This election took place in a two-year period during which Labour lost ten seats in by-elections, never with a swing of less than ten percent against them. Oldham West was convincingly gained for the Conservatives with a 17.7% swing by Bruce Campbell with a majority of 3,311 over the Labour candidate Michael Meacher. Meacher, a future minister both under Wilson and in the Blair government, would go on to recover the seat from Campbell in the 1970 general election: 1968-1970 was the only time in the post-World War II era that this division of Oldham was not represented by Labour. The Liberal Party, contesting the seat for the first time since 1951, finished in fourth place, while a creditable third place was gained by the former Liberal and celebrated novelist John Creasey. Creasey two years previously had formed his own party of national unity, the short-lived All Party Alliance. He was joined on the campaign trail by the well-known actor Robert Beatty, and made effective use of local newspapers to promote his campaign. This was the third in a series of by-elections which he fought, and though his best result to date, it was to be his last. He stated after the election that he intended to stand in the constituency again in the next general election; however in 1970 he announced that he would not be doing so.

Architect  Angelo Invernizzi, a wealthy Italian engineer of Genoa, Italy, dreamed of building a house that would “maximize the health properties of the sun by rotating to follow it”.Mical, Thomas. Surrealism and Architecture. London: Routledge, 2005. p. 157 He designed the house for himself with the help of Romolo Carapacchi, a mechanical engineer; Fausto Saccorotti, an interior decorator; and Ettore Fagiuoli, an architect.Mical, Thomas. p. 156 Invernizzi’s daughter, Lidia Invernizzi, described in the 17-minute film “Il girasole: una casa vicino a Verona” by Marcel Meili and Christoph Schaub, Invernizzi could have built the house himself, but he instead invited many people to participate in its creation: painters, sculptors, furniture makers, and more. “People who believed in a new era: nothing should be built as before.” Having a family connection to Marcellise, even though working and living in Genoa, he wanted to build the house there in its hilly splendor and with its memories of a simpler life.Il girasole: una casa vicino a Verona. Switzerland, 1995. 17 min. Color. Italian. Directors: Marcel Meili, Christoph Schaub  History and construction  Invernizzi first began drawing designs for his rotating house in 1929, but construction started in 1931, only during summer months. Invernizzi and his team used the project as a means to experiment with new materials, like concrete and fibre cement. \\"In keeping with the project's experimental nature, a considerable amount of adaptation and refinement accompanied construction\\".The Revolving Villa. Architecture Week http://www.ArchitectureWeek.com/2009/0715/building_1-1.html They ended up using aluminium sheeting to replace the concrete on the outside walls because the concrete had left cracks. At first, Invernizzi only expected the house to make a 180 degree turn, but eventually after he saw it make the 180 degree turn, he \\"decided to make the complete turn\\" of 360 degrees. The project was complete in 1935, after four years.The Revolving Villa. Architecture Week.  Interior/Exterior  Il Girasole has two storeys and is shaped like the letter \\"L\\". It sits on an over 44 metre circular base, with a 42 metre tall tower at the centre. This is where the house rotates from, using motors.

An assortment of bedrooms and bathrooms are found on the second floor.The Revolving Villa (continued). Architecture Week http://www.ArchitectureWeek.com/2009/0715/building_1-2.html Villa Girasole’s interior design is such that one experiences a number of different progressions of light throughout the day: \\"Though the views from either wing differ at any given moment, they share a general orientation to the sun, reducing the chance for conflict over which direction the house should point. All rooms could share an equal amount of daylight or shade\\".The Revolving Villa (continued). Architecture Week  Machinery  Villa Girasole runs on two diesel fuel motors which move the house over circular tracks and allow trolleys to slide the house along.

On December 17, 2010, it was announced that O'Donnell was one of two CIS players to be named to the East–West Shrine Game. College career When O’Donnell first suited up at Queen's back in 2007 he was a sizable yet very green 18-year-old rookie. But his time spent under the Queen's coaching staff allowed him to develop into one of the top offensive line prospects in the country heading into the 2011 CFL Draft. Heading into the draft O'Donnell was ranked 11th on the CFL Amateur Scouting Bureau's list of the top prospects. The ranking is certainly deserved after an impressive college career. He won the Gaels’ Justin Schwieg Trophy as most improved player in 2008, and was named The Orrin Carson Memorial Trophy for best Offensive Lineman twice, for the 2009 and 2010 seasons. He was also named a first-team All-Canadian in both 2009 and 2010, and took home the OUA award for best lineman this past season. Professional career =CFL= O'Donnell was chosen in the second round and 15th overall by the Saskatchewan Roughriders. O'Donnell was the fourth offensive lineman taken in the draft, but was the highest CIS offensive lineman selected. =NBA= On May 31, 2011, it was reported that O'Donnell had chosen to delay his signing with the Roughriders due to the NBA's Boston Celtics put him through a workout session in June.

According to the Twic origin myth, their ancestors came from Patunduu' or Patundur, which lay to the west of Paliau, where Atwic and his brother, Yiep, lived. They had a falling out, and Atwic left his brother in Patunduu'. After Atwic's departure, Patundur suffered an eight-year drought, which only ended when Yiëu asked his brother to return. When Atwic returned so did the rains, earning him the chieftainship.The names of the communities of Twic were named for the various colors of bulls that were sacrificed to celebrate Atwic's return (for the story, see ) Dr. John Garang a founder of the SPLA and the first Vice President of the Republic of Sudan and the first President of South Sudan was born in Wangulei in Twic East County.

In particular it can be used to construct the totally ramified abelian extensions of a local field. It does this by considering the (formal) endomorphisms of the formal group, emulating the way in which elliptic curves with extra endomorphisms are used to give abelian extensions of global fields. Definition of formal groups Let Zp be the ring of p-adic integers. The Lubin–Tate formal group law is the unique (1-dimensional) formal group law F such that e(x) = px + xp is an endomorphism of F, in other words :e(F(x,y)) = F(e(x), e(y)). More generally, the choice for e may be any power series such that :e(x) = px + higher-degree terms and :e(x) = xp mod p. All such group laws, for different choices of e satisfying these conditions, are strictly isomorphic. We choose these conditions so as to ensure that they reduce modulo the maximal ideal to Frobenius and the derivative at the origin is the prime element. For each element a in Zp there is a unique endomorphism f of the Lubin–Tate formal group law such that f(x) = ax + higher-degree terms. This gives an action of the ring Zp on the Lubin–Tate formal group law. There is a similar construction with Zp replaced by any complete discrete valuation ring with finite residue class field, where p is replaced by a choice of uniformizer. Example We outline here a formal group equivalent of the Frobenius element, which is of great importance in class field theory,e.g. Serre (1967). generating the maximal unramified extension as the image of the reciprocity map. For this example we need the notion of an endomorphism of formal groups, which is a formal group homomorphism f where the domain is the codomain. A formal group homomorphism from a formal group F to a formal group G is a power series over the same ring as the formal groups which has zero constant term and is such that: :f(F(X,Y))=G(f(X),f(Y)) Consider a formal group F(X,Y) with coefficients in the ring of integers in a local field (for example Zp). Taking X and Y to be in the unique maximal ideal gives us a convergent power series and in this case we define F(X,Y) = X +F Y and we have a genuine group law. For example if F(X,Y)=X+Y, then this is the usual addition. This is isomorphic to the case of F(X,Y)=X+Y+XY, where we have multiplication on the set of elements which can be written as 1 added to an element of the prime ideal. In the latter case f(S) = (1 + S)p-1 is an endomorphism of F and the isomorphism identifies f with the Frobenius element. Generating ramified extensions Lubin–Tate theory is important in explicit local class field theory. The unramified part of any abelian extension is easily constructed, Lubin–Tate finds its value in producing the ramified part. This works by defining a family of modules (indexed by the natural numbers) over the ring of integers consisting of what can be considered as roots of the power series repeatedly composed with itself. The compositum of all fields formed by adjoining such modules to the original field gives the ramified part. A Lubin–Tate extension of a local field K is an abelian extension of K obtained by considering the p-division points of a Lubin–Tate group. If g is an Eisenstein polynomial, f(t) = t g(t) and F the Lubin–Tate formal group, let θn denote a root of gfn-1(t)=g(f(f(⋯(f(t))⋯))). Then K(θn) is an abelian extension of K with Galois group isomorphic to U/1+pn where U is the unit group of the ring of integers of K and p is the maximal ideal. Connection with stable homotopy theory Lubin and Tate studied the deformation theory of such formal groups. A later application of the theory has been in the field of stable homotopy theory, with the construction of a particular extraordinary cohomology theory associated to the construction for a given prime p. As part of general machinery for formal groups, a cohomology theory with spectrum is set up for the Lubin–Tate formal group, which also goes by the names of Morava E-theory or completed Johnson–Wilson theory.

Founded in the 12th century to serve a priory and villagers in the riverside location, it has experienced little change despite a 19th-century restoration. Its ancient chancel arch and doorway have remarkable carvings with \\"grotesque, boggle-eyed monsters\\", rare beakhead figures and chevron ornamentation. Standing in a picturesque setting behind a farm, the flint and Caen stone building was used for worship until 1978, when it was declared redundant. It is now cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust, and English Heritage has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Tortington is an ancient manor and parish next to the River Arun in West Sussex. The ecclesiastical parish was originally shaped like an inverted triangle, but many boundary changes took place over the centuries. As well as the manor—mentioned in the Domesday survey of 1086—there was a medieval Augustinian monastery, Tortington Priory. An agricultural hamlet had developed by the 12th century, and its layout and function have changed little since then. The church retains a 12th- century doorway with carvings \\"like something out of a medieval fantasy\\". A church was first mentioned in the mid-12th century, when there was a rectory. It was built primarily to serve the priory. The doorway and \\"delightful\\" chancel arch survive from that era—both have been dated to 1140—and the layout and fabric of the church are still largely 12th-century despite subsequent restoration. An aisle with two bays was added to the south side of the nave in the 13th century, and the doorway was moved to accommodate it. The aisle was later destroyed (during or before the 18th century), and its arcade was blocked. Another 13th-century change was the addition of lancet windows in the north and south walls of the chancel. The church was quick to install seating for parishioners as this gradually became standard in the 15th and 16th centuries (until then, churches had none). Some of these early seats survive, in the form of plain, straight-headed wooden benches. Features described in the medieval period but now lost include a Lady chapel—a recess on the outside of the chancel wall may be a remnant of this—a leaded steeple and a porch, of which there are fragmentary remains. A white bell-turret, similar to that at St Andrew's Church at nearby Ford, replaced the steeple. Constructed of timber and added in the 18th century, it was apparently painted white to help with navigation along the adjacent River Arun. Also in the 18th century, the chancel arch and chancel roof were remodelled (the nave had already acquired a timber king post roof in the medieval era) The south aisle, added in 1867, replaced a 13th-century aisle which had been destroyed many years before. Many Sussex churches were restored during the Victorian era, sometimes drastically; St Mary Magdalene's Church was reordered in 1867, but the changes were modest. A new south aisle was built to replace the destroyed 13th-century aisle, and the arcade separating it from the nave was unblocked. The doorway was moved to its original position as a result. A vestry was built on the north side in 1892, and Philip Mainwaring Johnston undertook further work in 1904. The area remained sparsely populated in the 20th century, and congregations declined. The Diocese of Chichester declared St Mary Magdalene's Church redundant on 1 August 1978. It was placed into the care of the Redundant Churches Fund (now the Churches Conservation Trust) on 21 April 1980, and is now one of five former churches in West Sussex administered by the charity; the others are at Chichester, Church Norton, North Stoke and Warminghurst. St Mary Magdalene's Church was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 5 June 1958. Such buildings are defined as being \\"nationally important and of special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 913 Grade II listed buildings, and 960 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Arun. =Parochial history= The parish boundaries and advowson of St Mary Magdalene's Church have a complicated history. For most of its existence, it was a parish church with its own vicar, although the incumbents did not always live in the parish (they generally lived in nearby Arundel from the early 19th century onwards). The church at Binsted was within the parish in the 16th century. In 1897, the parish ceased to be independent: it became part of a joint benefice with Arundel. A third church, at South Stoke, was added to this arrangement in 1929; the parishes were never merged though. Tortington's identity survives as of in the legal name of the parish of St Nicholas' Church, Arundel: Arundel with Tortington. Its benefice is still called Arundel with Tortington and South Stoke. The advowson (the right to appoint clergy) was first mentioned in 1214, when it was held by William d'Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel. It passed to Tortington Priory by 1380 and stayed with that institution until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century, when it passed to the Lord of the Manor at Tortington Manor. This continued throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, although the Earl of Arundel apparently held the right again in 1579 and The Crown made three appointments in the 17th century. Various other noblemen held the advowson in the 18th and 19th centuries until it passed to the Bishop of Chichester in 1897. Architecture \\"Grotesque monsters\\" glare down at the congregation from around the chancel arch. St Mary Magdalene's Church has a nave, a narrower chancel, a vestry on the north side accessed from the nave, a south aisle with an arcade, a timber bell-turret and a roof of clay tiles which slopes steeply as a catslide over the aisle. Flint and stone rubble are the main building materials; there are quoins of Caen stone. Remains of the original south porch can still be seen. Charles Eamer Kempe's stained glass window of St Richard of Chichester is considered one of his best works. The most distinctive features of the church are its two surviving Norman-era structures: the south doorway and the chancel arch. These are densely and richly carved with a wide range of decorations, including bizarre monsters and unusual beakhead-shaped designs. The latter are rare in Sussex—only St Mary's Church at Broadwater and St Mary de Haura Church at Shoreham-by-Sea have similar designs. The doorway, whose door has decorative strap hinges, has three layers of carvings in its semicircular arch; they are in the form of chevrons, stars and grapes. The chevrons form a zigzag pattern and reach the jambs and capitals; the outside face has the grape-like motifs in the angles where these meet, and the labels (horizontal elements) have the repeating star pattern. Nikolaus Pevsner describes the carvings as \\"keeping inside the established pattern\\" of such work, and not displaying the \\"extraordinary ... [simultaneously] mannered and extrovert\\" details of the carved doorway at St Mary's Church at nearby Climping. Inside, the carvings around the chancel arch—dating from about 1140, like the doorway—consist of \\"an amazing congregation of grotesque monsters\\", \\"boggle-eyed ... with beaks, tongues and squid-like tentacles, that frown and glare at visitors below\\". The roll mouldings of the arch are held in the beaks of these \\"fearsome\\", \\"wide- eyed horrors\\". Such \\"beakhead\\" decoration is a little-understood feature of Late Norman architecture: in churches, it may have been used to capture the congregation's interest or to inspire fear and awe. The moulding has two orders (recessed jambs which together form a chamfered opening): in contrast to the lavishly decorated outer order, the inner order is plain. Some Norman windows survive: these are large, round-arched and chamfered with deep splays. The chancel has 13th-century lancets, some of which have stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe (one, of St Richard of Chichester, has been described as \\"of exceptional quality compared with most windows of this period [late 19th century] in Sussex\\"). The east window of the chancel has stained glass attributed to Thomas Willement. The south aisle, added in the 13th century and unblocked in 1867 during the restoration of that year, has chamfered arches supported on round abaci and octagonal responds. The oldest internal fitting is a 12th-century font of Caen stone, with a round bowl, foliage decoration in the form of honeysuckles, decorative mouldings and an arcade-style motif with scallop-shaped capitals. An \\"interesting\\" plain Jacobean pulpit of the early 17th century, with legs rather than the usual single stem, may have been made by a local craftsman. There are 15th-century panelled pews in the south aisle. Above the chancel arch there are two 18th-century hatchments.

Professional career =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2011 Chatwood was drafted by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the second round of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft out of Redlands East Valley High School. Chatwood made his major league debut on April 11, 2011 in a loss against the Cleveland Indians where he went five innings, giving up four runs on four hits with three strikeouts and four walks. In his second start against the Chicago White Sox he earned his first major league win, pitching seven innings, only giving up one run on five hits and two walks while striking out three. Chatwood remained in the rotation for most of the season, making 25 starts for the Angels. His hits allowed and inability to control his pitches led to him finishing with an ERA of 4.75 and a 6-11 record. =Colorado Rockies= On November 30, 2011, Chatwood was traded to the Colorado Rockies for catcher Chris Iannetta. Chatwood began the 2012 season in the Rockies bullpen, appearing in 4 games while recording 1 save. At the beginning of August, Chatwood was inserted in the rotation. He finished with a record of 5-6 with a 5.43 ERA in 19 games (12 starts). In 2013, Chatwood had his best season despite missing half the season because of injury. Chatwood made 20 starts, going 8-5 with a 3.15 ERA and inducing an over 50% groundball rate for the Rockies. In July 2014, Chatwood underwent Tommy John surgery to repair the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow in his pitching arm, ending his season after just 4 starts. He signed a two-year, $2 million extension with the Rockies on January 14, 2015. After sitting out the entire 2015 season to recover from Tommy John surgery, Chatwood came back healthy in 2016. He made 27 starts in 2016, posting a 12-9 record with a 3.87 ERA over 158 innings. Despite his struggles at Coors Field in 2016 (6.12 ERA over 78 innings), Chatwood led all qualified pitchers in road ERA, he finished 2016, with a 1.69 road ERA over 80 innings and an 8-1 road record. In January 2017, Chatwood and the Rockies avoided arbitration. The two sides settled on a one-year deal for 4.4 million dollars for the 2017 season. On April 15, 2017, Chatwood retired the first 17 batters until giving up a single by Chris Marrero. Chatwood helped his own cause with a 2-run single, and pitched a complete game as the Rockies shut out the San Francisco Giants 5-0. =Chicago Cubs= On December 7, 2017, Chatwood signed a three-year, $38 million contract with the Chicago Cubs. On April 29, 2018, Chatwood hit an RBI single, scoring Addison Russell, for his first hit as a Chicago Cub. Chatwood began the 2018 season in Chicago's starting rotation, but after compiling a 4.98 ERA with 84 walks in 95 innings and the Cubs acquisition of Cole Hamels, he was moved to the bullpen.

The theory defines two broad and very different approaches to incorporating new information into an individual's mind, and claims that those approaches have a resulting impact in many day-to-day life decisions and encounters. A person with mapping tendencies receives new information; facts, techniques, abilities, and undergoes a process of incorporating the new information into a personally developed and self-adaptive model of the world. The individual then operates in their lives with the expectation that this model is largely correct, and strives to revise the model when his/her experiences can not be interpreted as compatible with the current state of the model. Each successive revision approaches a more accurate representation of the world for that individual, proceeding in a positivist manner. It is claimed that mapper behavior can be very confusing when observed by individuals who do not have the mapper orientation. Since mappers do not want to continue to interact with the world when their map is in conflict with their experiences, they can appear introverted at times, or completely engaged in resolving an issue such as a subtle terminology quirk. Non-mappers have difficulty decoding the motivations behind a mapper's actions, and may jump to judgmental conclusions based on what would have motivated themselves to act in the same way. As a result, the non-mappers project motivations onto the mapper's actions which probably do not correspond to the actual driving factors for the mapper. The theory proposes that mappers are a source of much of the creativity and originality in the world, for reasons that may be related to Lateral thinking.

Early life Barnham was probably born in Thetford, the son of Peter Barnham (b. 1544) of that city. The suggestion that he was a son of Sir Francis Barnham of Hollingbourne and his wife Elizabeth Leonard, daughter of Sampson LennardJohn Burke, John Bernard Burke A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies is an error. The subject of this entry has sometimes been confused with both William Barnham (b. 1613) and with his own grand nephew William Barnham, esquire (1651-1718), based upon their supposed tenure as mayor of Norwich. However, neither of them held that office. The statement that William was baptised at Saint Martin-in-the-Fields on 19 May 1613 is also unlikely, based upon the year and place of his birth, and probably refers to William Barnham (b. 1613) of Boughton Monchelsey, Kent. Career as politician He was a hosier of Norwich and became an alderman.History of Parliament Online - Barnham, William (This source suggests that Barnham was born in Thetford and does not corroborate Burke's birth attribution which, as previously mentioned, applies to a different person) He was mayor of Norwich in 1652. A parliamentary sympathizer in the Civil War, he held municipal office from 1646 and throughout the Interregnum, and was returned to Richard Cromwell's Parliament for the city. In 1659, Barnham was elected Member of Parliament for Norwich in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He signed the address to George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle for a free Parliament, and in 1660 he was elected without contest as MP for Norwich in the Convention Parliament. He stood for parliament in 1661 but came third in the poll. He was listed by Lord Wharton as a friend, but his only known activity in the Convention was on the committee to encourage shipping and woollen manufactures. He was heavily defeated at the general election, and displaced as alderman by the commissioners for corporations, although he had subscribed £8 to the voluntary gift to the King. Several times re-elected, he never resumed office because, as a hard-shell Presbyterian, he would not renounce the Covenant. After extensive charitable bequests to Thetford, he left property in Horsham St., Faith and Beeston to two kinsmen, Thomas and John Barnham [N.B., probably his nephews, sons of his brother Thomas]. The latter was court candidate for Norwich in 1688, but no other member of his family entered Parliament.

The Russian troops, unarmed and moving in a loose formation, were taken by complete surprise and defeated, losing their large wagon train. Background During the Livonian War, Livonia was invaded by the Russian army of Tsar Ivan IV. After the defeat in the Battle of Ergeme in 1560, the weakened Livonian Order was dissolved and the Duchy of Livonia and Duchy of Courland and Semigallia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania according to the Treaty of Vilnius (1561). Russia then launched a campaign against Lithuania, capturing Polotsk in February 1563 and threatening further invasion against Vilnius, the capital city. The Lithuanians attempted to negotiate a truce, but the talks failed in November 1563. Battle Two large Russian armies from Polotsk and Smolensk, commanded by and , were to meet near Orsha and jointly march against Vilnius. The army was well-prepared for a long campaign; Velikiye Luki received supplies sufficient to provide the army for half a year. Shuysky moved on January 23, 1564. Not expecting to meet any large enemy forces on his path, he made a critical mistake by allowing his troops to march without order and with their armor and weapons being carried in the wagon train. Mikołaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwiłł, Grand Lithuanian Hetman, who at the time was in Lukoml, quickly organized cavalrymen without waiting for infantry or artillery. His men included Field Hetman Hrehory Chodkiewicz and many future military leaders: his 16-year-old son and future grand hetman Krzysztof Mikołaj \\"the Thunderbolt\\" Radziwiłł, future field hetman Roman Sanguszko, future Livonian hetman Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz, and others. The details of the battle vary based on source. There are at least 15 contemporary sources, including three official reports written within days after the battle and four artistic works glorifying the winners, but they all provide different and often conflicting details and statistics. Radziwiłł attacked Shuysky's army while it marched from Polotsk to Drutsk. Two main versions of the battle can be identified. The first version claims that the Russians were either carelessly marching in a loose order or making preparations for the night rest and were unarmed at the time of the attack. A small Lithuanian detachment engaged the vanguard units, while the main forces attacked the unprepared Russian troops. The second, Lithuanian version claims that Shuysky positioned his army for an attack in an open field and was ready to attack the Lithuanians as soon as they emerged from the woods. However, perhaps overconfident in his numbers, he delayed the initial attack and allowed the Lithuanians enough time to position their troops. All sources agree that the Lithuanians achieved a complete victory and that Russian commander Prince Pyotr Shuysky was killed in action. There are several versions of Shuysky's death. The most popular version claims that he was injured and retreated from the battlefield and was later axed to death by a local peasant. Another version has it that he was found in a well with a bullet hole in his head. Mikołaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwiłł claimed that it was his client Kasparas Šveikovskis who killed Shuysky. His body was transported to Vilnius and buried with full honors in an Orthodox church. It was claimed that many other boyars were killed or taken prisoners. The exact number of Russian casualties sustained in this battle varies from 150 to 700 men in Russian chronicles; the first estimate is regarded as incomplete. The Lithuanians claimed to have defeated 9,000 or even 20,000, a figure that is considered as heavily exaggerated. The large Russian wagon train was lost and, according to a witness, so much loot was taken that soldiers gave away bread for free and armor was sold for one Hungarian gold coin. Aftermath Upon learning of the defeat of Shuysky and the loss of the much-needed wagon train, the army of Prince Serebryany-Obolensky safely retreated to Russian territory, bringing significant damage to the enemy by devastating and sacking a large swathe of Lithuanian territory in passing, defeating Lithuanian squads, and taking numerous prisoners. It was attacked by Filon Kmita and Jurgis Astikas near Orsha and, believing that they were attacked by the main Lithuanian forces, hastily retreated further. These two victories averted the Russian invasion and restored the power balance in the Livonian War. The Lithuanians devastated a wide area around Sebezh, but, expecting the Tatars to assist them in waging war on the Russian realm, did not have enough momentum to recapture Polotsk during a three-week siege. Although the battle slowed down one of the Russian offensives in January, it did not change the course of the ongoing border war which was not much in favour of the Lithuanians. The battle was followed by skirmishes and Lithuania could not recover the significant lost territories. In the very same month, as well as in February, other Russian armies launched numerous and successful attacks against their foe. In January, voivodes from Nevel and Polotsk conducted an offensive against Lithuania, while in January and February Russian forces attacked Dubrowna, Orsha, Druchevsk, Borisov, Kopos, Shklow, Teterin, Mogilev, Radoml, Mstislavl, and Chachersk, reaching as far as the border of Vilnius and the Berezina River. In August 1564, a Russian squad of Boyars' Sons from Pskov, led by V. Veshnyakov, defeated a Lithuanian force at Krasny Gorodok. At the end of the same month, Russian Tatars from Kazan and Astrakhan, commanded by V. Buturlin, arrived and waged war on Lithuania. In October, the Russians captured the town of Ozerische. In 1565, both sides continued their struggle against each other, though with a lower intensity. This time the Lithuanians tried in vain to take the city of Krasny in October and sacked some Russian volosts, whereas Russian Cossacks responded with sacking numerous villages on Lithuanian territory. The Lithuanians used their victory at Ula to derail negotiations for the Union of Lublin, which were initiated in hopes to obtain Polish military support in the war with Russia. Some authors believe that defeats in the Livonian War might have contributed to the deterioration of Tsar Ivan's mental state, leading to the establishment of Oprichnina in 1565.

She was designed as an Auxiliary Steam Ship - steam power would be used to supplement the propulsion from the sails, when there was no wind or if there was a light head wind. She was fitted with a propeller that could be lifted up when sailing, so as to reduce drag.\\"Launch\\", 8 September 1865, Glasgow Herald pg 4, column 7 The engine was not powerful enough to push the ship, with all the windage of standing rigging, directly into a strong headwind. Auxiliary steam power had the advantage of allowing this vessel to use the Suez Canal when it opened in 1869 - something which was not possible for sailing vessels. China trade The Erl King was used in the China trade – sailing from Britain to China to collect, primarily, tea. The ending of the British East India Company's monopoly of the tea trade from China to Britain in 1834 had given rise to the tea clipper era, with much of the tea that was brought from China being carried in high speed sailing vessels that competed to get the first \\"new crop\\" to market in Britain. (Slower sailing vessels also carried tea.) In 1866, the Erl King entered this trade in competition with the sailing vessels. The tea clippers, if able to load a cargo early, would race against each other, often with a premium payment written into the bills of lading for the winning ship. These races were reported in the newspapers, bets were placed, and tea wholesalers and retailers would mention which ship had carried the batches of tea they were selling.for example: Adverts, 6 January 1871, Sheffield Independent pg 1, column 5 1866 happened to be a very close race among the tea clippers. The Erl King loaded a cargo of 1,108,100 pounds of tea in Foochow and sailed on 5 June 1866. The first clippers had left a week earlier.\\"The Great Ocean Race from China\\", 1 August 1866, Glasgow Herald pg 4, column 4 However, the Erl King arrived in London on 20 August 1866, a passage of 77 days – with the sailing vessels still in the Atlantic.\\"The Great Ocean Race from China, Arrival of the SS Erl King\\", 24 August 1866, Glasgow Herald pg 4, column 6 The fastest clippers arrived on 6 September with passage times of 99 days – their race was virtually a dead heat. The merchants who had promised the 10 shillings a ton premium to the winning sailing vessel therefore lost out, not only because so many race participants had arrived at the same time, but because \\"new crop\\" tea from the Erl King had already been on the market for well over a week. The Erl King also carried passengers. On her 1866 passage from China, these included the wife of Captain MacKinnon, master of the Taeping, one of the two clippers that tied first place in the Tea Race that year.

Christian cross defacing the chin and forehead. Found in the Agora of Athens. National Archaeological Museum in Athens. The anti-paganism policies of the early Byzantine Empire ranged from 395 till 476. Anti-paganism laws were enacted by the Byzantine Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, Theodosius II, Marcian and Leo I the Thracian. They reiterated previous legal bans, especially on pagan religious rites and sacrifices and increased the penalties for their practice. The pagan religions had still many followers but they were increasingly obliged to keep under cover to formally comply with the edicts. Significant support for paganism was present among Roman nobles, senators, magistrates, imperial palace officers, and other officials. Many Christians pretended to be such while continuing pagan practices, and many converted back to paganism; numerous laws against apostasy kept being promulgated and penalties increased since the time of Gratian and Theodosius. pagans were openly voicing their resentment in historical works, like the writings of Eunapius and Olympiodorus, and books blaming the Christian hegemony for the 410 Sack of Rome. Christians destroyed almost all such pagan political literature, and threatened copyists with cutting off their hands. Laws declared that buildings belonging to known pagans and heretics were to be appropriated by the churches. St. Augustine exhorted his congregation in Carthage to smash all tangible symbols of paganism they could lay their hands on. The persecution was somewhat reduced in some periods under the influence of the high-ranking general Stilicho and under the \\"usurper\\" Joannes Primicerius; a revival was attempted by Anthemius from 467. The legacy of Theodosius I Whilst \\"paganism, with Theodosius dies, never to rise again\\", according to a Christian historian\\"A History of the Church\\", Philip Hughes, Sheed & Ward, rev ed 1949, vol I chapter 6. committed pagans continued, wherever possible, to practice their faith discreetly or under cloak of common festivals and by keeping within the letter of the law if not its spirit,Gibbon, Edward The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, ch28 more commonly in the countryside, hence they are called \\"rustics - the pagani\\". Upon the death of Theodosius, in 395, the Empire was divided between his two incompetent sons. Political crisis ensued; over the next several decades, the defence of the Empire gradually collapsed. During this prolonged disaster, some Christians became less certain of their religion and converted back to the old religion. Pagans blamed the Christians for the disasters affecting the empire.Eunapius reflects some of the pagan attitudes of this period in his writings. Despite the pleas of many pagans for tolerance, Honorius and Arcadius continued the work of their father by enacting even more anti-paganism laws to stop any revival of paganism. The fact that they had to keep repeating their threats by the enactment of numerous laws against the practice of paganism indicates that their efforts did not succeed in stamping out the old religion, which continued to be practiced discreetly.Theodosian Code 16.5.41 During the early part of the reign of Honorius, Stilicho was able to exercise unlimited power over the west. Stilicho exercised moderation in his religious policies and enacted laws that were favorable to the pagans. Consequently, during the time in which Stilicho held power, the pagans enjoyed a brief respite from persecution. =Arcadius laws, 395= On July 3, 395, Arcadius declared that the solemn days of the pagans were no longer to be included in the number of holidays.Theodosian Code 2.8.22 But the festival of the Navigium Isidis, and other pagan holydays, outlived this law.Alföldi (1937) p.47 In the same year, another law was passed by Arcadius that prohibited anyone from going to a pagan sanctuary or temple or of celebrating any kind of pagan sacrifice.Theodosian Code 16.10.13 This law seems to have been targeted at those Christians who were converting back to paganism as it specifically mentions \\"those who are trying to stray from the dogma of the Catholic faith.\\" In the year 396, the privileges of pagan priests and other clerics were officially revoked.Theodosian Code 16.10.14 In the same year, Arcadius ordered that pagan temples standing in the country were to be destroyed without disorder or riot such that they could not be used for pagan religious rites away from gaze of the authorities.Theodosian Code 16.10.16, 15.1.36 The large number of pagans in the east also seems to have forced Arcadius into allowing the ancient festivals and public games to continue but without religious rites that formed an essential part of the old religion.Theodosian Code 15.6.1, 15.6.2 =Stilicho laws, 399= In 399, three laws were enacted in the west, under the influence of Stilicho, which were relatively favorable to the pagans. Due to the riots caused by Christians in their attempts to destroy the temples, the first of these laws protected the pagan temples from the destruction of zealous Christians who pretended that they had been authorized by the government to destroy them.Theodosian Code 16.10.15 The second of these laws acknowledged the right of the people to continue to participate in traditional banquets, shows, gatherings and amusements once associated with the old pagan ways; it did, however, forbid the public performance of any pagan religious rites or sacrifice, an intrinsic part of a religion supported by custom rather than by argument.Theodosian Code 16.10.17 The third law forbade the destruction of pagan temples that had been cleared of forbidden things and ordered that they were to be kept in good repair even though the purpose for which they were first built was now prohibited.Theodosian Code 16.10.18 =Destructions by St. Augustine= At the turn of the century St Augustine would exhort his congregation in Carthage to smash all tangible symbols of paganism they could lay their hands on \\"for that all superstition of pagans and heathens should be annihilated is what God wants, God commands, God proclaims!\\" - words uttered to wild applause, and possibly the cause of religious riots resulting in sixty deaths. It is estimated that pagans still made up half of the Empire's population.MacMullen, R. Christianizing The Roman Empire A.D.100-400, Yale University Press, 1984, =Persecution laws by Honorius since 407= In the year 407 a decree was issued to the west from Rome: \\"If any images stand even now in the temples and shrines...., they shall be torn from their foundations...The temples situated in cities or towns shall be taken for public use. Altars shall be destroyed in all places.\\" After the death of Stilicho in 408, Honorius and his party in the state will gain control and enact once again harsh laws against pagans. In the year 408, Honorius enacted a new law which ordered that all statues and altars in the temples were to be removed and that the temple buildings and their income were to be appropriated by the government.Theodosian Code 16.10.19 This law also forbade the holding of any banquet or celebration in vicinity of the temples that was being used by pagans in the countryside as a pretext and cover for religious celebrations.Gibbon, Edward The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, ch28, note 54. The execution of this law was placed in the hands of the bishops. Two other laws decreed that buildings belonging to known pagans and heretics were to be appropriated by the churches.Constitutiones Sirmondianae 12.Theodosian Code 16.5.43 Arcadius died in 408 and his eight- year-old son, Theodosius II was thereupon proclaimed emperor in the East. In the same year, Honorius enacted a law that prohibited anyone who was not Catholic from performing imperial service within the palace.Theodosian Code 16.5.42 Zosimus reports that Honorius was forced to repeal this law after one of his best officers, who was a pagan, resigned in protest.Zosimus 5.46 At the beginning of the year 409, Honorius enacted a law that punished judges and officials who did not enforce the laws against the pagans.Theodosian Code 16.5.46 This law even punished men of rank who simply kept silent over any pagan rite performed in their own city or district. =Sack of Rome by Alaric I, 410= The hopes of the pagans were revived with the elevation of Priscus Attalus, at Rome, in the year 409. Alaric I, however, soon tired of his puppet and Attalus was deposed in the summer of 410 when Honorius promised to negotiate a peace treaty. When these negotiations failed, Alaric took and sacked the city of Rome. This catastrophe shocked the entire Roman world. Coming so soon after the proscription of the old religion, pagans began to blame Christianity and the neglect of the traditional rites for something that had hitherto been thought impossible. In this heated atmosphere, Honorius once again reiterated his anti-pagan legislation.Theodosian Code 16.5.51 =The attack on pagan literature= Augustine's City of God is an answer to the charges that Christianity and its persecution on paganism was responsible for the precedently unimaginable Sack of Rome.Dodds, Marcus (1890) Preface to The City of God, WM. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company Little of this class of literature written from a pagan perspective has survived, which was due to Christians who destroyed these political works they considered to be contrary to their religious beliefs, and threatened copyists with the cutting of their hands;.MacMullen, Ramsay (1986) Christianity & Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries, Yale University Press, p.4 quote: \\"non Christian writings came in for this same treatment, that is destruction in great bonfires at the center of the town square. Copyists were discouraged from replacing them by the threat of having their hands cut off The transmission path of all such literature has been described as a \\"differentially permeable membrane\\" that \\"allowed the writings of Christianity to pass through but not of Christianity's enemies\\"..\\"Our sole copy of the sole work about political good sense by the person arguably best able to deliver it to us from classical antiquity, Cicero,\\" writes Ramsay MacMullen, \\"was sponged out from the vellum to make room for the hundredth copy of Augustine's meditation on the psalms.\\"MacMullen, Ramsay (1997) Christianity & Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries, Viking and Compass The only fragments of Julian's \\"Against the Galileans\\" that have survived Christian censorship appear in a refutation by Bishop Cyril of Alexandria.Kirsch, R. (1997) God Against the Gods, p.279, Viking and Compass By the time Augustine had published the early books that comprised \\"The City of God\\" he describes how pagan authors in North Africa felt it too dangerous to publish their refutations and Augustine writes nothing to reassure them about this threat.Augustine of Hippo, \\"The City of God\\", Book 5, chapter 26. There are numerous fragments extant of several pagan historical works, such as the works of Eunapius and Olympiodorus, which indicate that pagans were openly voicing their resentment in writing. =More anti-pagan laws since 415= Some pagans would appear to have continued to practice their faith when circumstances permitted, as the emperors continued issuing laws. In the year 415, Honorius enacted yet another law that appropriated the pagan temples, even though they were no longer used for their intended purpose, and ordered that all objects that had been consecrated for pagan sacrifices in the past were to be removed from public places.Theodosian Code 16.10.20 In 416, Honorius and Theodosius II ordered that pagans would no longer be admitted to imperial service nor would they be allowed to receive the rank of administrator or judge.Theodosian Code 16.10.21 In 423, Theodosius II reiterated the previous laws against pagans and declared that all pagans who were caught performing the ancient rites would now have all their goods confiscated and be exiled but at the same time seemingly indicating that there were few pagans left:Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, ch 28, note 67. \\"The pagans who remain, although we believe there are none..\\"Theodosian Code 16.10.22, 16.10.23, 16.8.26. Joannes Primicerius In August of the year 423, Honorius died and power was seized in the west by Joannes, who had held the office of Primicerius Notariorum. Joannes appears to have ushered in a period of religious toleration. Joannes seems to have attempted to curb the power of ecclesiastics and the privileges of the church in an attempt to treat all people equally.A law in the Theodosian Code (16.2.47) refers to a tyrant who issued edicts in opposition to the church. This tyrant (i.e. usurper) is most likely to be identified with Joannes the Primicerius. In the year 423, Theodosius II published a law that demanded that Christians (whether they were really such or pretended to be so) were not to disturb pagans who were living peaceably and doing nothing contrary to the law.This law (Theodosian Code 16.10.24) is interesting because it officially recognizes the fact that there were many people who only pretended to be Christian. In 425, Theodosius II accompanied an expedition to the west to depose Joannes and establish Valentinian III as emperor of the west. After Joannes was captured and executed, Valentinian III was proclaimed emperor in the city of Rome. Theodosius II anti-pagan laws since 425 Theodosius II enacted two anti-pagan laws in the year 425. The first of these stipulated that all pagan superstition was to be rooted out.Theodosian Code 16.5.63 The second law barred pagans from pleading a case in court and also disqualified them from serving as soldiers.Constitutiones Sirmondianae 6 Theodosius II then left Valentinian III to rule the west and returned to Constantinople. The numerous laws against pagans seems to have had only limited immediate effect in stamping out the old religion. Many people simply conformed outwardly and pretended to become Christian while secretly continuing to practice their beliefs. The numerous laws against apostasy, that had been continuously promulgated since the time of Gratian and Theodosius, is evidence that the emperors were having a hard time even keeping Christians from going astray.Theodosian Code 16.7.1, 16.7.2, 16.7.3, 16.7.4, 16.7.5, 16.7.6Justinian Code 1.7.2. In the year 426, Theodosius II made it illegal for Christian apostates to convert to the old religion, and against those who pretended to become Christian but continued to perform pagan sacrifices.Theodosian Code 16.7.7 He found it necessary to reiterate his prohibition of pagan rites and sacrifices in 435, this time increasing the penalty to death.Theodosian Code 16.10.25 This law also ordered that all pagan shrines, temples and sanctuaries that still existed were to be destroyed by the magistrates. Magistrates who failed to carry out this order were ordered to be punished with death. In 438 Theodosius legislated again, forbidding pagan sacrifice once more.Corpus Legum Novellarum Theodosii 2.3 Theodosius seems to admit that pagan sacrifices were still seemingly being openly celebrated in places. It reads: Theodosius II married Eudocia, the daughter of a pagan sophist named Leontius, who herself patronized various pagans including Cyrus of Panopolis and the poet Nonnus. Anti-pagan laws by Marcian (450–457) The continued vitality of pagans led Marcian, who became emperor of the east in 450 upon the death of Theodosius II, to repeat earlier prohibitions against pagan rites. Marcian decreed, in the year 451, that those who continued to perform the pagan rites would suffer the confiscation of their property and be condemned to death. Marcian also prohibited any attempt to re-open the temples and ordered that they were to remain closed. In addition to this, in order to encourage strict enforcement of the law a fine of fifty pounds of gold was imposed on any judge or governor, as well as the officials under him, who did not enforce this law.Justinian Code 1.11.7 However, not even this act by Marcian had the desired effect, as his successor Leo I the Thracian will have to issue a new anti-pagan law in 472. Two more laws against paganism, which may be from this period, are preserved in the Justinian Code.These laws (Justinian Code 1.11.9, 1.11.10) do not give any date nor do they mention the emperors who promulgated them. After the deposition of Avitus, who ruled as emperor of the West from 455 to 456, there seems to have been a conspiracy among the Roman nobles to place the pagan general Marcellinus on the throne to restore paganism; but it came to nothing.Sidonius Epistle 1.11.6 Attempted pagan revival by Anthemius Anthemius, one of the last Roman emperors of the West who ruled from 467 to 472, seems to have planned a pagan revival at Rome.Photius Bibliotheca cod. 242 He was a descendant of Procopius, the relative of Julian. Anthemius gave Messius Phoebus Severus, a pagan philosopher who was a close friend of his, the important offices of Praefectus urbi of Rome, Consul and Patrician. Anthemius placed the image of Hercules, in the act of vanquishing the Nemean lion, on his coins. The murder of Anthemius (by Ricimer) destroyed the hopes of those pagans who believed that the traditional rites would now be restored.Marcellinus Chronicle s.a. 468 Anti-pagan laws by Leo I (457–474) In the year 457, Leo I the Thracian succeeded Marcian and became the first emperor to be crowned by the Patriarch of Constantinople. In 472 Leo I published a new law in 472 which imposed severe penalties for the owner of any property who was aware that pagan rites were performed on his property. If the property owner was of high rank he was punished by the loss of his rank or office and by the confiscation of his property. If the property owner was of lower status he would be physically tortured and then condemned to labor in the mines for the rest of his life.Justinian Code 1.11.8 See also * Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire Notes and references Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire Religion in the Byzantine Empire ","title":"Anti-paganism policies of the early Byzantine Empire"},{"id":"31457994","text":"Gerardo Daniel Acosta Mateuci (born February 22, 1984 in Montevideo, Uruguay) is a Uruguayan football Defender currently playing for Sportivo Belgrano of the Primera B Nacional in Argentina.

Biography  Mackintosh is a Dutch singer, composer, actress and writer, born in Amsterdam, and the daughter of Surinamese singer Max Woiski, Jr. and granddaughter of musician Max Woiski, Sr. At seventeen she was talent scouted by the Dutch actor Jack Monkau and traded a formal education for a career in music. = The early years (1972–1990) = Being the daughter of two parents in the music industry, a career along that road seemed a natural step to take. Mackintosh became a professional singer with the acceptance of a role in the musical Hair. Next she played key roles in the Dutch rock opera Ik, Jan Cremer and the high- profile musical Barnum. Mackintosh then decided to become more experienced as a lead singer and played in different rock and hard rock bands. She also toured on a regular basis. One of the highlights was an extended tour in Sudan, Kuwait and Egypt. This was also the period in her career where she had the honor to perform with jazz legends like Oscar Peterson and B.B. King. In 1977, Mackintosh released her first jazz single, a cover version of the Rodgers and Hart classic \\"My Funny Valentine\\". = Transition to jazz (1990-now) = Winning the 1990 'Vocalistenprijs' at the Dutch Jazzconcours in Breda led to a significant career change. Mackintosh then decided to specialize in jazz music. She started to perform extensively in Europe and the United States and was a regular performer at the legendary North Sea Jazz Festival. In 1993 she released her debut album, It's not perfect to be easy. She received recognition for this album with the nomination for an Edison Jazz Award. Two more albums were released in this period: This is the strangest life I've ever known is released in 1994, followed by Seasons, in 1997. Being an artist with the desire to develop and transform, Mackintosh took a different take on her career when she formed the 'Lils Mackintosh & The Swing Cats' band in 1998. This period also marked the return to the theatre, with the Jazznight theatre tour, together with the Beets Brothers, the Stylus Horns and the Rosenberg Trio. Her fourth studio album, Black girl, produced by the renowned saxophone player Hans Dulfer, is a tribute to the American blues singer and guitar player Huddie Ledbetter. The album was released in 1999 and made a big impression in the jazz scene. This, in turn, led to Mackintosh's first Edison Jazz Award. Published on multi-channel SACD in 2002, Mackintosh's first live endeavor was a recording session at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam, in front of a live audience. The album, named 'In the wee small hours of the morning' was well received by both critics and audiophiles. That same year the Beets Brothers released the first-ever Dutch jazz DVD, featuring Mackintosh and Hans Dulfer. A close collaboration with saxophone player Wouter Kiers led to the release of the concept album Comes love in 2005. All of the songs deal with different aspects of love and relationships. After a period of extensive touring in Europe, Mackintosh released the album About crazy. This 2008 album is an intimate portrait of an artist who has seen significant ups and downs in her personal life. Mackintosh also used the classic Hammond organ to create a distinctive moody and melancholic sound. The album coincidentally marked the start of her long term collaboration with the Dutch saxophone player Clous van Mechelen. The release of the 2010 album A fine romance is an audiophile's delight. This was actually a remastering of Mackintosh's debut album. In this version, extra care was taken in finding the right balance between voice and band, and achieving the highest possible sound quality. The album is a classic demo disc for the demonstration of high-end audio systems. = Masterclasses = Mackintosh learned most of her craft by doing many performances, and has always had the desire to share her knowledge, experience and mostly her passion for singing. In 1995 Mackintosh started giving masterclasses and workshops, at jazz festivals and in theatres. In these master classes Mackintosh used her experience to help aspiring singers further develop their voices, to use the stage to their advantage, and above all, to emote. Nowadays, Mackintosh does a monthly masterclass in Amsterdam. = Future projects= 2012 marks the celebration of Mackintosh's 40-year anniversary as an artist, which will result in the release of a new live CD. Mackintosh will record this album together with the renowned Jazz Orchestra of the Concertgebouw.  Vocal type  “Few singers can do jazz with a raw and bluesy feel like Lils Mackintosh.” – Angelique van Os, journalist, 2009. Mackintosh is often compared to Billie Holiday, but that comparison is superficial at most. What these singers have in common is the capacity to immerse themselves into a song and sing it as if it were their own story. But other than that, Mackintosh's sound is very much her own. She has a multi octave range, but uses two distinctly different voices to emote her music. Her lower voice is more bluesy in character and has a full warm sound, her high voice has a husky feel to it; it's melancholic with a little rough edge to boot. Mackintosh is instantly recognizable and her timing and phrasing are exemplary.

The show was curated by William Jenkins at the International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House (Rochester, New York), and remained open to the public from October 1975 until February 1976.Jenkins, William. New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape. Catalogue. Rochester, NY: International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House, 1975. The exhibition had a ripple effect on the whole medium and genre, not only in the United States, but in Europe too where generations of landscape photographers emulated and are still emulating the spirit and aesthetics of the exhibition. Since 1975 \\"New Topographics\\" photographers such as Robert Adams,\\"Robert Adams: Landscapes of Harmony and Dissonance\\", exhibition notice, The Getty, 2006. Lewis Baltz,First of six pages of a Lewis Baltz checklist, George Eastman House, 2002. Bernd and Hilla Becher, Frank Gohlke, Nicholas Nixon, and Stephen Shore\\"Stephen Shore, Photographer\\", billcharles.com. have influenced photographic practices regarding landscape around the world. Moreover, and as a proof of the impact of this exhibition beyond the American scene, two out of the ten photographers in the show, Baltz and Gohlke, were later commissioned by the French government for the Mission de la DATAR. Details For \\"New Topographics\\" William Jenkins selected eight then-young American photographers: Robert Adams, Lewis Baltz, Joe Deal, Frank Gohlke, Nicholas Nixon, John Schott, Stephen Shore, and Henry Wessel, Jr. He also invited the German couple, Bernd and Hilla Becher, then teaching at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in Germany. Since the late 1950s the Bechers had been photographing various obsolete structures, mainly post-industrial carcasses or carcasses-to- be, in Europe and America. They first exhibited them in series, as \\"typologies\\", often shown in grids, under the title of \\"Anonymous Sculptures.\\" They were soon adopted by the Conceptual Art movement. Each photographer in the New Topographics exhibition was represented by 10 prints. All but Stephen Shore worked in black and white. The prints were in a 20 cm × 25 cm (8″×10″) format except for Joe Deal (32 cm × 32 cm), Gohlke (24 cm × 24 cm – close enough to 8”×10” though obviously square rather than rectangular), and the Bechers with typical European (for the time) 30 cm × 40 cm prints.Archives of the George Eastman House, Rochester (NY): the museum owns the entire show except for the prints by the Bechers. In his introduction to the catalogue, Jenkins defined the common denominator of the show as \\"a problem of style:\\" \\"stylistic anonymity\\", an alleged absence of style. Jenkins mentioned Edward Ruscha's work, especially the numerous artist books (26 Gasoline Stations (1962), Various Small Fires (1964), 34 Parking Lots (1967), etc.) that he self-published in the 1960s as one of the inspirations for the exhibition and the photographers it features (except for the Bechers). \\"The pictures were stripped of any artistic frills and reduced to an essentially topographic state, conveying substantial amounts of visual information but eschewing entirely the aspects of beauty, emotion and opinion,.\\" \\"[...] rigorous purity, deadpan humor and a casual disregard for the importance of the images.\\" Technically, half the photographers were working with 8″×10″; (20 cm × 25 cm) large format view cameras; those who were not were using either square medium format (Deal, Gohlke), or in the case of Baltz, 35 mm Technical Pan, a slow and high-definition Kodak film that the photographer printed on 8″x10″ paper. Only Baltz and Wessel were using regular 35 mm cameras and film. A notable element of the show was that the artists were, or would be, linked with higher education as students, professors, or both—a change from the preceding generations. The shift from craft or self-teaching to academia had somewhat been started by photographers such as Ansel Adams and Minor White, but the new generation was turning away from the approach of these forebears. This was illustrated by the subject matter that the New Topographics chose as well as their commitment to casting a somewhat ironic or critical eye on what American society had become. They all depicted urban or suburban realities under changes in an allegedly detached approach. In most cases, they gradually revealed themselves as coming from rather critical vantage points, especially Robert Adams, Baltz, and Deal. The exhibition was recreated in various locations: in 1981, six years after its original presentation, it was shown in reduced form at the Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol, UK, under the auspices of Paul Graham and Jem Southam. A large scale presentation of the exhibition was organized in 2009 at the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson. \\"New Topographics\\" began an international tour in 2009, with stagings at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2011 the exhibition was on view at the Nederlands Fotomuseum in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and later at the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum in Spain.Traveling Exhibitions at the Center for Creative Photography. Although the eight photographers included in the original exhibition make up the core of the New Topographics school, photographers such as Laurie Brown have been tied to the school.

As stated by the title, the painting is meant to portray a man playing an accordion. The division of three-dimensional forms into a two-dimensional plane indicate that the painting is in the style of analytic cubism, which was developed by Picasso and Georges Braque between 1907 and 1914. The onset of cubism is possibly due to Picasso and Braque rebelling against centuries of traditional, realistic art that imitates the natural world. In earlier stages of analytic cubism, such as Picasso's Carafe, Jug and Fruit Bowl, Picasso begins to break up the subject matter and alter the sense of depth. However, in earlier work there is still a defined sense of the subject's shape and volume. The picture plane is distorted, but not to the same extent as later paintings such as The Accordionist which verge on complete abstraction. Also differentiating early and late analytical cubism is the use of color. In Carafe, Jug and Fruit Bowl Picasso uses color to define the table cloth, bowls, and fruit, allowing the viewer to easily discern the subject matter, despite the slight flattening and separation of the picture plane. The Accordionist on the other hand is almost monochromatic which further camouflages the subject.  The painting  The Accordionist is 51.25 inches tall and 35.25 inches wide, painted in oil on canvas. The composition consists of a multitude of geometric shapes of various sizes and content. The shapes most densely populate the middle of the painting, fanning out in a kind of triangle shape from the top to the bottom of the painting. Since there is no obvious subject, this composition leads the viewer's eye around the painting in an attempt to decipher the content. Also focused toward the center of the painting are the dark colors, which aid in drawing the viewer in to explore the painting. Picasso utilized the drab, muted tones in order to place the emphasis on the subject. Picasso's dull palette also lends itself well to the piecing together of the different perspectives of the same subject.  Interpretation  In the top middle portion of the painting there is a cluster of curvaceous shapes. These shapes seem to form the face of the accordion player, which then leads down to the player's body that expands out from neck to shoulders to the rest of the body. Following the face down the painting, there is a large right angle that protrudes from the upper portion of the painting, which seems to be the player's arm. The arm is bent in such a manner that suggests the player is resting his arm on the arm of a chair and is sitting down. Further suggesting that the player is seated is the round shape to the right of Picasso's signature in the bottom left portion of the painting. This shape looks as if it could represent the embellishment on the bottom of a chair leg. The same kind of shape is seen on the right side of the painting and the spacing between the two encourages the viewer to see the shapes as legs to an armchair. A little further up from the second chair leg one can see the beginnings of the accordion. There is one fragment that has three small circles lined up in a vertical row next to what seems to be the last three fingers on a person's hand. From the title, it can be assumed that this represents someone playing the accordion. Moving left from the hand and keys, there is a series of rectangular shapes, probably meant to depict the folds in an accordion. The keys and folds around the player's hand are shown from multiple viewpoints, which make it difficult to determine the exact direction of the accordion.

Description Heath Wood contains a series of 59 barrows which is a Viking burial site near Ingleby, Derbyshire. The barrows are unusual because they are the only known Scandinavian cremation site in the British Isles. It is believed to be a war cemetery of the Viking Great Army which arrived in England between 873–8 A.D. Early excavations by Thomas Bateman in May 1855 found that some of the mounds were empty cenotaph mounds where presumably the body was not available.Ten Years Digging, Thomas Bateman Excavations between 1998 and 2000 produced a number of finds which are available in Derby Museum. It is believed that these remains are from the same period as burials discovered in nearby Repton. However, the Repton burials are not cremations. This wood is currently leased by the Forestry Agency from the Church Commissioners and it is designated \\"Derbyshire 101\\" as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. One entrance The path that goes through the wood links Foremarke Hall with Knowle Hill which are two properties previously owned by the Burdett family together with the land belong to Heath Wood. Presumably, the path was useful when the family moved to Knowle Hill whilst building work was in progress in order to visit St Saviour's church which the family built in 1662. In the eighteenth century Heath Wood was actually a field and the growth of woodland has only happened since then. Without the woods being there then this burial place would have had a fine view of the Trent valley. The path that goes through the woods neatly misses any of the ancient barrows and it is believed that no barrows were removed to ease its path.
