Also, the unaccounted money that is concealed from the tax administrator is called black money. The black money is accumulated by the criminals, smugglers, hoarders, tax-evaders and other anti- social elements of society. Around 22,000 crores of rupees are supposed to have been accumulated by the criminals for vested interests, though writ petitions in the supreme court estimate this to be even larger, at ‚Çπ300 lakh crores. The total amount of black money deposited in foreign banks by Indians is unknown. Some reports claim a total of US$1.06 - $1.4 trillions is held illegally in Switzerland. Other reports, including those reported by the Swiss Bankers Association and the Government of Switzerland, claim these reports are false and fabricated, and the total amount held in all Swiss bank accounts by citizens of India is about 2 billion. In February 2012, the director of India's Central Bureau of Investigation said that Indians have US$500 billion of illegal funds in foreign tax havens, more than any other country. In March 2012, the government of India clarified in its parliament that the CBI director's statement on $500 billion of illegal money was an estimate based on a statement made to India's Supreme Court in July 2011. In March 2018, it was revealed that the amount of Indian black money currently present in Swiss and other offshore banks is estimated to be ‚Çπ300 lakh crores or US$1.5 trillion. Sources of black money income  The root cause for the increasing rate of black money in the country is the lack of strict punishments for the offenders. The criminals pay bribes to the tax authorities to hide their corrupt activities. Thus, they are rarely punished by the judge. The criminals who conceal their accounts from the government authorities include big politicians, film stars, cricketers, and businessmen. Some Indian corporations practice transfer mispricing, by under-invoicing their exports and over- invoicing their imports from tax haven countries such as Singapore, UAE, and Hong Kong. Thus the promoters of the public limited companies who hold rarely more than 10% of share capital, earn black money abroad at the cost of majority share holders and tax income to the Indian government. By the year 2008, the cumulative Illicit Financial Out flows from the country touched US$452 billions. Political organizations, corrupt politicians and government officials take bribes from foreign companies then park or invest the money abroad in tax havens for transferring to India when needed. In addition, locally earned bribes, funds and collections are often routed abroad through hawala channels in order to evade Indian tax authorities and consequent legal implications. In the Vodafone-Hutchison tax case, a foreign multinational company also evaded tax payments in India by making transactions with shell companies registered in tax haven countries. The unlawfully acquired money kept abroad is routed back to India by the round tripping processes. Round tripping involves getting the money out of one country, sending it to a place like Mauritius and then, dressed up to look like foreign capital, sending it back home to earn tax-favoured profits. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is one of the legal channels to invest in Indian stock and financial markets. As per data released by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), two of the topmost sources of the cumulative inflows from April 2000 to March 2011 are Mauritius (41.80 per cent, US$54.227 billions) and Singapore (9.17 per cent, US$11.895 billions). It is not plausible that the small economies of Mauritius and Singapore are the true origins of such huge investments. It is apparent that the investments are being routed through these jurisdictions in order to conceal from revenue authorities the identities of such tax evaders; In many cases they are Indian residents who have invested in their own companies. Investment in the Indian stock market through participatory notes (PNs) or overseas derivative instruments (ODIs) is another way in which the black money generated by Indians is re-invested in India. The investor in PNs does not hold the Indian securities in her or his own name. These are legally held by the FIIs, but derive economic benefits from fluctuations in prices of the Indian securities, as also dividends and capital gains, through specifically designed contracts. Foreign funds received by charitable organisations, non-government organisations (NGOs) and other associations need not disclose the Indian beneficiary. Gold imports through official channel and smuggling is a major conduit to bring back the black money from abroad and convert into local black money as the gold commands high demand among the rural investors particularly. Also fictitious high value round trip transactions via tax haven countries by diamonds and precious stones exporters and importers is a channel for to and fro transactions outside the country. Also, fictitious software exports can be booked by software companies to bring black money into India as tax exemptions are permitted to software companies. Unlike in earlier decades, the interest rates offered abroad in US currency is negligible and there is no capital appreciation if the money is parked abroad by the Indians. So, Indians are routing their foreign funds back to India as the capital appreciation in Indian capital markets is far more attractive. The use of Swiss banks for storing black money In early 2011, several reports Indian media alleged Swiss Bankers Association officials to have said that the largest depositors of illegal foreign money in Switzerland are Indians. These allegations were later denied by Swiss Bankers Association as well as the central bank of Switzerland that tracks total deposits held in Switzerland by Swiss and non-Swiss citizens, and by wealth managers as fiduciaries of non-Swiss citizens. James Nason of Swiss Bankers Association in an interview about allowed black money from India, suggests \\"The (black money) figures were rapidly picked up in the Indian media and in Indian opposition circles, and circulated as gospel truth. However, this story was a complete fabrication. The Swiss Bankers Association never said or published such a report. Anyone claiming to have such figures (for India) should be forced to identify their source and explain the methodology used to produce them.\\" In August 2010, the government revised the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement to provide means for investigations of black money in Swiss banks. This revision, expected to become active by January 2012, will allow the government to make inquiries of Swiss banks in cases where they have specific information about possible black money being stored in Switzerland. In 2011, the Indian government received the names of 782 Indians who had accounts with HSBC. As of December, 2011, the Finance Ministry has refused to reveal the names, for privacy reasons, though they did confirm that no current Members of Parliament are on the list. In response to demands from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) opposition party for the release of the information, the government announced on 15 December that, while it would not publish the names, it would publish a white paper about the HSBC information. According to White Paper on Black Money in India report, published in May 2012, Swiss National Bank estimates that the total amount of deposits in all Swiss banks, at the end of 2010, by citizens of India were CHF 1.95 billion (INR 92.95 billion, US$2.1 billion). The Swiss Ministry of External Affairs has confirmed these figures upon request for information by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. This amount is about 700 fold less than the alleged $1.4 trillion in some media reports. In February 2012, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director A P Singh speaking at the inauguration of first Interpol global programme on anti- corruption and asset recovery said: \\"It is estimated that around 500 billion dollars of illegal money belonging to Indians is deposited in tax havens abroad. Largest depositors in Swiss Banks are also reported to be Indians\\". In a hint at scams involving ministers, Singh said: \\"I am prompted to recall a famous verse from ancient Indian scriptures, which says ‚Äì ‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§§‡§•‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡§æ. In other words, if the King is immoral so would be his subjects\\" The CBI Director later clarified in India's parliament that the $500 billion of illegal money was an estimate based on a statement made to India's Supreme Court in July 2011. After formal inquiries and tallying data provided by banking officials outside India, the government of India claimed in May 2012 that the deposits of Indians in Swiss banks constitute only 0.13 per cent of the total bank deposits of citizens of all countries. Further, the share of Indians in the total bank deposits of citizens of all countries in Swiss banks has reduced from 0.29 per cent in 2006 to 0.13 per cent in 2010. The through the Investigation Division of the Central Board of Direct Taxes released a White Paper on Black Money giving the Income Tax Department increased powers.Black Money, May 2012, MINISTRY OF FINANCE, DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, CENTRAL BOARD OF DIRECT TAXES, NEW DELHI http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2012/may/d2012052101.pdf 2015 HSBC leaks In February 2015,balances for the year 2006-07 in HSBC's Geneva branch. The list was obtained by French newspaper Le Monde and included the names of several prominent businessmen, diamond traders and politicians. The number of Indian HSBC clients is roughly double the 628 names that French authorities gave to the Indian Government in 2011. Indian government said it will probe into this matter. The balance against the 1195 names stood at . The list which had names of dictators and international criminals, was simultaneously published by news organisations in 45 countries including The Guardian, UK; Haaretz, Israel; BBC, London. HSBC had helped its clients evade taxes and said in a statement that \\"standards of due diligence were significantly lower than today.\\" 2016 Panama Papers leak The 2016 Panama Papers scandal is the largest-ever leak of information on black money in history. International Consortium of Investigative Journalists first obtained the leaked information, revealing over 11 million documents. These documents pertain to 214,000 offshore entities and span almost 40 years. The papers originated from Mossack Fonseca, a Panama-based law firm with offices in more than 35 countries. The list of names exposed in the scandal includes 500 Indians who flouted rules and regulations, such as Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai, Niira Radia, KP Singh, Garware family, Harish Salve, and others. 2016 demonetisation drive From 2011 to 2014, the BJP included the return of Indian black money in their manifesto. In speeches, their prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi promised to get this black money (estimated to be ‚Çπ90 lakh crores or US$1500 billion) back to India. On 8 November 2016, in a sudden address to the nation, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that banknotes of ‚Çπ500 and ‚Çπ1000 would cease to be legal tender from midnight. He said this decision was taken to crack down on black money and corruption which was destroying the country. He also said that the process of cash circulation was directly related to corruption in his country impacting the lower classes of society. However, neither Indian banks, nor the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) were adequately prepared for this, resulting in currency shortages up to March 2018 and difficulties for Indian citizens. As per government figures, the number of income tax returns filed for 2016‚Äì17 grew by 25 per cent to 2.82 crores (compared to growth rate of 9.9% in the previous year), and the advance tax collections during that period rose 41.8% over the one-year period, as more individuals filed their tax returns after demonetization. By 28 December 2016, official sources said that the Income Tax department detected over of un- disclosed income and seized new notes worth as part of its country-wide operations. The department carried out a total of 983 search, survey and enquiry operations and has issued 5,027 notices to various entities on charges of tax evasion and hawala-like dealings. The department also seized cash and jewellery worth over out of which the new currency seized (the majority of them ‚Çπ2000 notes) is valued at about . The department also referred a total of 477 cases to other agencies like the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to probe other financial crimes like money laundering, disproportionate assets and corruption. Domestic black money The Economic Times reported that Indian companies as well as politicians routinely misuse public trusts for money laundering. India has no centralized repository‚Äî like the registrar of companies for corporates‚Äîof information on public trusts. SIT and Supreme court case Noted jurist and former law minister Ram Jethmalani along with many other well known citizens filed a Writ Petition (Civil) No. 176 of 2009 in the Supreme Court of India (SC) seeking the court's directions to help bring back black money stashed in tax havens abroad and initiate efforts to strengthen the governance framework to prevent further creation of black money. In January 2011, the SC asked why the names of those who have stashed money in the Liechtenstein Bank have not been disclosed. The court argued that the government should be more forthcoming in releasing all available information on what it called a \\"mind-boggling\\" amount of money that is believed to be held illegally in foreign banks. The SC on 4 July 2011, ordered the appointment of a Special Investigating Team (SIT) headed by former SC judge BP Jeevan Reddy to act as a watch dog and monitor investigations dealing with the black money. This body would report to the SC directly and no other agency will be involved in this. The two judge bench observed that the failure of the government to control the phenomenon of black money is an indication of weakness and softness of the government. The government subsequently challenged this order through Interlocutory Application No. 8 of 2011. The bench (consisting of Justice Altamas Kabir in place of Justice B Sudershan Reddy, since Justice Reddy retired) on 23 September 2011 pronounced a split verdict on whether government plea is maintainable. Justice Kabir said that the plea is maintainable while Justice Nijjar said it is not. Due to this split verdict, the matter will be referred to a third judge. In April 2014, Indian Government disclosed to the Supreme Court the names of 26 people who had accounts in banks in Liechtenstein, as revealed to India by German authorities. On 27 October 2014, Indian Government submitted name of three people in an affidavit to the Supreme Court who have black money account in foreign countries. But on the very next day, Supreme Court of India orders centre Government to reveal all the names of black money account holders which they had received from various countries like Germany. The honorable bench of the Supreme court also asked the Centre not to indulge in any kind of probe rather just pass the names to them and Supreme court will pass the order for further probe. But the facts were the other way round, as the clarification affidavit filed by the Finance Ministry on 27 October revealed. The affidavit asserted that a complete list of cases where information had been obtained from the German and French governments, with the status of the action taken by the government was submitted by the Central Board of Direct Taxes on 27 June. It added that the CBDT officials also met and briefed the SIT on the status of the cases, background of the information received, non-sharing of information by Swiss authorities, and constraints faced by the government and alternative methods of securing account details. On 12 May 2015, Ram Jethmalani attacked Modi Government for failing to bring back the Black money as was promised before Election. International tax lawyer Ashish Goel has argued that the Modi Government failed miserably to take steps to bring back black money stacked in foreign banks. On 2 November 2015, HSBC whistleblower Herve Falciani said he is willing to \\"cooperate\\" with the Indian investigative agencies in black money probe but would need \\"protection\\". Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav furnished a letter written by Falciani on 21 August 2015, to Justice (retd) M B Shah, who is heading the SIT on black money. Under the supervision of the SIT the I-T department has recovered just around Rs 3,500 crore from some of the account holders and expected to recover a total of 10000 crore till March 2015. =Double taxation agreements= Indian Government has repeatedly argued before the Court that it cannot divulge the names. It has further argued that the privacy of individuals would be violated by the revelation of data. These arguments are only designed to stall the revelation of names of some favoured entities. BJP leader Dr. Subramanian Swamy said that DTA was not a valid reason for not revealing names of the accounts of Indians held in foreign banks. DTAA is about declared white incomes of entities so that tax may be levied in one or the other country and not in both. Black income is not revealed in either of the two countries so there is no question of double taxation. Further, this data would not be available to either of the two countries to be exchanged. It is no wonder then that till date, no data has been supplied to India by any of the countries with which this treaty has been signed. In brief, DTAA is about white incomes and not black incomes, so it is disingenuous to say that in future no data would be given to us if names are given to courts. =Criticism of government= Different governments have tried to stall SIT. A bank has been revealed to have acted like a \\"hawala\\" operator. Other MNC and private Indian banks are also suspected to have indulged in these activities. The HSBC Black money whistleblower Herve Falciani, who works with a team of lawyers and experts, told NDTV that there is \\"1000 times more information\\" available for investigators and there are a lot of business procedures to be unveiled to them. \\"It's just up to (the Indian administration). They can contact us,\\" he said. He said India was given only 2 MB of the 200 GB of data. \\"If India asks tomorrow we will send a proposal tomorrow,\\" he added. On 2 November 2015, Falciani told in a press conference organised by Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav that, India has not used information on those illegally stashing away black money in foreign bank accounts, and still millions of crores were flowing out. Hasan Ali case Hasan Ali was arrested by Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax Department on charges of stashing over 60 billion rupee in foreign banks. ED lawyers said Hasan Ali had financed international arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi on several occasions. However, media sources claimed this case is becoming yet another perfect instance of how investigative agencies like Income Tax Department go soft on high-profile offenders. Hasan Ali's premises were raided by ED as far back as 2016. According several news reports, the probe against him has proceeded at an extremely slow pace and seems to have hit a dead end. Today claimed that it had verified a letter confirming the US$8 billion in black money was in a bank of bank UBS account, and the government of India too has verified this with UBS. The bank of bank UBS has denied Indian reports alleging that it maintained a business relationship with or had any assets or accounts for Hasan Ali, accused in the US$8 billion black money case. Upon formal request by Indian and Thailand government authorities, the bank announced that the documentation supposedly corroborating such allegations were forged, and numerous media reports claiming US$8 billion in stashed black money were false. Today, in a later article, wrote, \\"Hasan Ali stands accused of massive tax evasion and stashing money in secret bank accounts abroad. But the problem is that the law enforcement agencies have precious little evidence to back their claims. For one, UBS Zurich has already denied having any dealings with Hasan Ali .\\" Estimates As Schneider estimates, using the dynamic multiple-indicators multiple-causes method and by currency demand method, the size of India's black money economy is between 23 and 26%, compared to an Asia-wide average of 28 to 30%, to an Africa-wide average to 41 to 44%, and to a Latin America-wide average of 41 to 44% of respective gross domestic products. According to this study, the average size of the shadow economy (as a percent of \\"official\\" GDP) in 96 developing countries is 38.7%, with India below average. Public protests and government's response In May 2012, the Government of India published a white paper on black money. It disclosed India's effort at addressing black money and guidelines to prevent black money in the future. =MC Joshi committee= After a series of ongoing demonstrations and protests across India, the government appointed a high- level committee headed by MC Joshi (the then CBDT Chairman) in June 2011 to study the generation and curbing of black money. The committee finalised its draft report on 30 January 2012. Its key observation and recommendations were: # The two major national parties (an apparent reference to Indian National Congress, BJP) claim to have incomes of merely and . But this isn't \\"even a fraction\\" of their expenses. These parties spend between and annually on election expenses alone. # Change maximum punishment under Prevention of Corruption Act from the present 3, 5 and 7 years to 2, 7 and 10 years rigorous imprisonment and also changes in the years of punishment in the Income Tax Act. # Taxation is a highly specialised subject. Based on domain knowledge, set up all-India judicial service and a National Tax Tribunal. # Just as the USA Patriot Act under which global financial transactions above a threshold limit (by or with Americans) get reported to law enforcement agencies, India should insist on entities operating in India to report all global financial transactions above a threshold limit. # Consider introducing an amnesty scheme with reduced penalties and immunity from prosecution to the people who bring back black money from abroad. =Tax Information Exchange Agreements= To curb black money, India has signed TIEA with 13 countries‚ÄîGibraltar, Bahamas, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Isle of Man, the Cayman Islands, Jersey, Liberia, Monaco, Macau, Argentina, Guernsey and Bahrain - where money is believed to have been stashed away. India and Switzerland, claims a report, have agreed to allow India to routinely obtain banking information about Indians in Switzerland from 1 April 2011. In June 2014, the Finance Minister Arun Jaitely on behalf of the Indian government requested the Swiss Government to hand over all the bank details and names of Indians having unaccounted money in Swiss banks. Demonetisation of 500 and 1000 rupee currency notes Following recommendations from the OECD on curbing black money on 22‚Äì23 February 2014 and previous moves by the RBI, on the night of 8 November 2016 the Indian Government decided to ban old notes and change them with new 500 and 2000 rupee notes. Similar moves had been made earlier in pre-independence era in 1946 and also in 1978 by the first non-Congress government called Janata government. ATMs all over India remained closed for two days and banks for one day. Also, until 31 December, people were only allowed to withdraw Rs 2,500 maximum per day from ATMs, Rs 24,000 per week from banks. Online bank transactions have been granted exemption from such limits. The issuing of the ‚Çπ2000 sought to throw hoarders of black money off by rendering the cash money they held in large denomination currency notes as useless. This meant they would need to get the notes exchanged at a bank or post office, which would be near impossible due to the exchange limits. Additionally, banks and authorities would question the large amounts of cash held by many hoarders, who now risked an official investigation being launched into their money situation. Economists and financial analysts believe that a large percentage of black money being held in cash in India would now be brought into the mainstream economy through the banks, which would bolster economic growth over the long term. Furthermore, the move is also intended as a way to cut down on the funding of terrorism, by rendering useless the large currency denominations of black money or counterfeit currency being paid to sleeper cells. =Previous Information= In 2012, the Central Board of Direct Taxes had recommended demonetisation, saying in a report that \\"demonetisation may be a solution for tackling black money or economy, although it is largely held in the form of benami properties, bullion and jewellery\\".http://dor.gov.in/sites/upload_files/revenue/files/Measures_Tackle_BlackMoney.pdf According to data from income tax probes, black money holders keep about 9% of their ill-gotten wealth as cash, hence targeting this cash may be considered as a successful strategy. On 28 October 2016 the total banknotes in circulation in India was . In terms of value, the annual report of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) of 31 March 2016 stated that total bank notes in circulation valued to of which nearly 86% (around ) were ‚Çπ500 and ‚Çπ1,000 banknotes. In terms of volume, the report stated that 24% (around 22.03 billion) of the total 90266 million banknotes were in circulation. In the past, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had opposed demonetisation. BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi had said in 2014 that \\"The aam aurats and the aadmis (general population), those who are illiterate and have no access to banking facilities, will be the ones to be hit by such diversionary measures.\\" The Government of India devised an Income Declaration Scheme (IDS), which opened on 1 June and ended on 30 September 2016. Under the scheme, the black money holders could come clean by declaring the assets, paying the tax and penalty of 45% thereafter. Modi said that the queues due to demonetisation were the last queues that would end all other queues. Proposals to prevent Indian black money =History= Even in colonial India, numerous committees and efforts were initiated to identify and stop underground economy and black money with the goal of increasing the tax collection by the British Crown government. For example, in 1936 Ayers Committee investigated black money from the Indian colony. It suggested major amendments to protect and encourage the honest taxpayer and effectively deal with fraudulent evasion. =Current Proposals= In its white paper on black money, India has made the following proposals to tackle its underground economy and black money. =Reducing disincentives against voluntary compliance= Excessive tax rates increase black money and tax evasion.When tax rates approach 100 per cent, tax revenues approach zero, because higher is the incentive for tax evasion and greater the propensity to generate black money. The report finds that punitive taxes create an economic environment where economic agents are not left with any incentive to produce. Another cause of black money, the report finds is the high transaction costs associated with compliance with the law. Opaque and complicated regulations are other major disincentive that hinders compliance and pushes people towards underground economy and creation of black money. Compliance burden includes excessive need for compliance time, as well as excessive resources to comply. Lower taxes and simpler compliance process reduces black money, suggests the white paper. =Banking transaction tax= Arthakranti, Pune-based think-tank has outlined policy prescription that involves replacement of most direct and indirect levies with a banking transaction tax and de-monetisation of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 to help prevent Indian black money, ease inflation, improve employment generation and also lower corruption. =Economic liberalisation= The report suggests that non-tariff barriers to economic activity such as permits and licences, long delays in getting approvals from government agencies are an incentive to proceed with underground economy and hide black money. When one can not obtain a licence to undertake a legitimate activity, the transaction costs approach infinity, and create insurmountable incentives for unreported and unaccounted activities that will inevitably generate black money. The successive waves of economic liberalisation in India since the 1990s have encouraged compliance and taxes collected by the government of India have dramatically increased over this period. The process of economic liberalisation must be relentlessly continued to further remove underground economy and black money, suggests the report.''' =Reforms in vulnerable sectors of the economy= Certain vulnerable sectors of Indian economy are more prone to underground economy and black money than others. These sectors need systematic reforms. As example, the report offers gold trading, which was one of the major sources of black money generation and even crime prior to the reforms induced in that sector. While gold inflows into India have remained high after reforms, gold smuggling is no longer the menace as it used to be. Similar effective reforms of other vulnerable sectors like real estate, the report suggests can yield a significant dividend in the form of reducing generation of black money in the long term. The real estate sector in India constitutes about 11 per cent of its GDP. Investment in property is a common means of parking unaccounted money and a large number of transactions in real estate are not reported or are under-reported. This is mainly on account of very high levels of property transaction taxes, commonly in the form of stamp duty. High transaction taxes in property are one of the biggest impediments to the development of an efficient property market. Real estate transactions also involve complicated compliance and high transactions costs in terms of search, advertising, commissions, registration, and contingent costs related to title disputes and litigation. People of India find it easier to deal with real estate transactions and opaque paperwork by paying bribes and through cash payments and under-declaration of value. Unless the real estate transaction process and tax structure is simplified, the report suggests this source of black money will be difficult to prevent. Old and complicated laws such as the Urban Land Ceiling Regulation Act and Rent Control Act need to be repealed, property value limits and high tax rates eliminated, while Property Title Certification system dramatically simplified. Other sectors of Indian economy needing reform, as identified by the report, include equity trading market, mining permits, bullion and non-profit organisations. =Creating effective credible deterrence= Effective and credible deterrence is necessary in combination with reforms, transparency, simple processes, elimination of bureaucracy and discretionary regulations. Credible deterrence needs to be cost effective, claims the report. Such deterrence to black money can be achieved by information technology (integration of databases), integration of systems and compliance departments of the Indian government, direct tax administration, adding data mining capabilities, and improving prosecution processes. =Supportive measures= Along with deterrence, the report suggests public awareness initiatives must be launched. Public support for reforms and compliance are necessary for long term solution to black money. In addition, financial auditors of companies have to be made more accountable for distortions and lapses. The report suggests Whistleblower laws must be strengthened to encourage reporting and tax recovery. =Amnesty= Amnesty programmes have been proposed to encourage voluntary disclosure by tax evaders. These voluntary schemes have been criticized on the grounds that they provide a premium on dishonesty and are unfair to honest taxpayers, as well as for their failure to achieve the objective of unearthing undisclosed money. The report suggests that such amnesty programmes can not be an effective and lasting solution, nor one that is routine. =Excessive demonetised currency notes= After the recent demonetisation of old 500 and 1000 Rs notes, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) collected these notes in excess of (more than INR 2 trillions) what it had officially released into circulation earlier. The value of fake notes received by RBI is negligible compared to total value. GoI shall conduct thorough probe to reveal how it has happened and bring to book the culprits. This could have happened by unscrupulous politicians yielding power with the connivance of RBI top brass to plunder wealth of the nation. =International enforcement= India has Double Tax Avoidance Agreements with 82 nations, including all popular tax haven countries. Of these, India has expanded agreements with 30 countries which requires mutual effort to collect taxes on behalf of each other, if a citizen attempts to hide black money in the other country. The report suggests that the Agreements be expanded to other countries as well to help with enforcement. =Modified currency notes= Government printing of such legal currency notes of highest denomination i.e.; and which remain in the market for only 2 years. After a 2-year period is expired there should be a one-year grace period during which these currency notes should be submitted and accepted only in bank accounts. Following this grace period the currency notes will cease to be accepted as legal tender or destroyed under the instructions of The Reserve Bank of India. As a consequence turning most of the unaccountable money into accountable and taxable money. =Holding United States currency= Many people in India who want to stash black money keep it as cash in US$ which will fetch appreciation in its value also as the INR gets devalued against US currency. GoI should tighten the rules to prevent acquiring/holding of the foreign currency (FC) cash in huge quantities by tracking cash transactions in US$ and limiting FC availability in small value through reputed banks / authorised firms by cashless transaction only. Smuggling of US$ into the country by NRIs, foreign tourists shall be curbed at entry ports. NRIs / foreign tourists shall conduct cashless transactions for acquiring INR currency, etc. All Indians who are going abroad should use international credit / debit cards instead of carrying US$ in cash with them. This would also prevent international trade in narcotics, terrorist funding, etc. =Corruption in education= Many institutions that are meant to provide education have been promoting corruption, and education has been a major contributor to domestic black money in India. Single common entrance exams for various professional courses (medicine and allied, engineering and allied, business management and allied), releasing the audited financial statements of the trusts/not-for-profit organizations that own these educational institutions in the public domain (website, a common e-repository), stoppage of government funds from AICTE, DST etc. to such institutions, are some of the suggestions to reduce the generation of black money in education. As per a report submitted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) to the Finance Ministry in December 2013, the capitation fees collected by private colleges, on management quota seats in professional courses, the previous year was around Rs 5,953 crores.''' =Withdrawal of currency notes of higher denomination= There have been suggestions to withdraw currency notes of higher denominations, such as the 2000 rupee notes. While this could lead to an increase in printing costs for the RBI, these costs should be weighed against the costs for misuse of high-value notes. Books Black money in India has been a popular subject of discussion but not many books have been authored on the subject. Books that have been authored on the subject of black money in India include: # The Black White & Grey: Re-coloring the Rupiah by Pragun Akhil Jindal #The Black Economy by Arun Kumar =The Black White & Grey= The book The Black White & Grey: Re-Coloring The Rupiah, authored by Pragun Jindal and published by Money Worries, looks at the black money menace and ways to curb it. Senior Congress Leader Manish Tewari and political commentator Paranjoy Guha Thakurta on 13 December 2016 launched the book, which attempts to debunk \\"a lot of lies, unknown facts and baseless rumours about Black Money\\". \\"A delinquent like poverty only affects the poor, unemployment affects those who are unemployed, alcoholism and drug abuse affect those who devour them, black money is a hitch which does not affect persons who amass 'black dough' but it affects the common man in the populace\\", said the author at the book's launch event.

Historical revision The new nomenclature of Mahyavanshi was given to a large number of the Mahyavanshi community in South Gujarat via a Government of India circular in 1939. This was due largely to the efforts of K. M. Munshi, then Home Minister of Bombay Presidency, and Dr. Purshottam Solanki, representative of the Depressed Classes of Gujarat, who stressed that its members were descendants of ancient rulers known as Mayavats. Later, in 1968, after the Indian annexation of Daman from the Portuguese, the community in Daman were given the same status. In the 1930s-40s, many depressed classes and communities were active in trying to change their caste name and elevate their social status to that of Rajput. These included the Khalpa, who wanted to be known as Rohitdesire to be known as Rishi, as well as the Vankar claim to Mahyavanshi status. Of these, only the Mahyavanshi claim was successful in gaining official recognition from the British Raj administration. In some cases, they had a history of working as butlers for members of the various European East India Companies in Surat since probably the 17th century and their success came because they were able to mobilise public opinion and procure support for their cause from both from British and Indian leaders and through books detailing their claimed history. The sociologist A. M. Shah says that the Mahyavanshi \\"have an elaborate mythology, caste journals, and written \\"laws\\" to regulate the affairs of the caste\\". A prominent figure in re-writing the history of the /Vankars was Makanji Kuber Makwana, who wrote several works on their putative ancient history and genealogy that linked them to the Mahyavat Rajputs, a branch of the Parmara clan who had ruled in eastern Bengal. He is regarded as the spearhead of the \\"Mahyavat Rajput Movement\\", which was the name given to the campaign to \\"regain\\" their Rajput status. The books of historical research concerning the Mahayavanshi were mainly published around the first decade of 20th century. These books included Makwana's Mayavat Rajput Prakash (1908) (A Light on Mayavat Rajputs), Mayavat Rajputoday (1911) (The Rise of Mayavat Rajput) and Mahyavanshi Atle Shu? (1911) (Who is a Mahyavanshi?) as well as Phakir Jeevan Mevashi's Mayavat Ranshingu arthat Khudarano Karta. In a 1931 lecture, Munshi stressed that the Mahyavanshi were the descendants of the Hattiavanshi king Arjuna, arguing that it was because of the slaughter of Parashurama that they had been relegated to a lower caste status. Others involved in this affirming this identity were Garibdasji Ramdasji and other Mahants of Ramanandi sect, Phakir Jeevan Mevasi, besides several of their community leaders spread across Bombay State (present day Maharashtra and Gujarat), Sindh ( Karachi and Raban ), Portuguese India ( Nani and Moti Daman ) and also from South Africa, where their population was living in cities like Johannesburg and Pretoria, who in unison impressed upon the government for revision of their social status. Subdivisions The Mahyavanshis are primarily divided into exogamous clans like Mathariya, Aatekar Pardinar, Damania, Kantharia, Barodia, Chaseia, Surti, Kosadia, Khanvanshi, Parmar, Rana, Rathod, Gohel, Solanki ,Tawdia Vaghela,Makwana,Zala,Padaya,Maru. Distribution The community members are mainly located in regions of Gujarat, other than Kutch, and in Daman. There are some in Rajasthan. The population is particularly numerous in Ahmedabad, Dahod, Mumbai,and from Bharuch to Dahanu Bordi of Maharashtra state, .

Hodgkinson was born in Marylebone to Sir George Edmund Hodgkinson, a shipbuilder, and Ellen Hodgkinson.London, England, Church of England Births and Baptisms, 1813-1917 Patent The patent application in 1896 (patent 1570), described a system in which :For the purpose of altering the speed of the gearing two or more pinions of different sizes are provided and arrangements made for shifting the driving chain from pinion to pinion. (\\"pinion\\" = \\"sprocket\\" in modern terms) The Gradient system based on these ideas was introduced commercially in 1900. Design The system used two chain-lifters to lift the chain from the sprockets. The cyclist would then back-pedal to disengage the chain and then shift the sprocket cluster laterally to the desired position. It would then engage when the cyclist started pedalling again. To allow for the smaller sprockets to slide into the hub, the larger gears were away from the wheel (unlike modern sprockets). A pulley on a spring-mounted arm adjusted for the chain slack; this system was originally introduced in the 1884 patent of Linley, Biggs and Tandy. In 1904, Hodgkinson sold an improved version of the Gradient design to Terot et Compagnie of Dijon, France, who were producing a version by 1907.

Plot  When the O'Glendy Wrecking Company is contracted to demolish an old hotel, \\"cannonballer\\" Duke Mason shows up at the worksite, having been hired by boss Mike O'Glendy. Wrecker Tom Kemp accuses Duke of jinxing every project on which he works, and after foreman Matt Carney breaks up the ensuing fistfight, he assigns Duke, an arrogant risk-taker, to work with him on the building's high watertower. While aloft, Matt slips and desperately clings to the edge of the tower, and Duke casually jokes with him before pulling him to safety. Later, Mike, who took over the business after her husband's death, tells Matt that she has put up a bond to save the company, and that they only have four weeks to bring down the twelve-story building. Wrecker Joe Poska then hosts a christening party after his wife Martha gives birth to a baby boy, but the wreckers have to leave suddenly to reinforce a section of unstable wall on the top of the hotel. The work goes smoothly until Joe accidentally falls to his death down the refuse chute while helping Duke dump a load of bricks. Joe's death reinforces Kemp's theory about the jinx, and Duke blames himself. While walking disconsolately on the street, Duke donates money to a missionary, who predicts that he will lighten someone's burden. Soon after, Duke rescues Peggy Starr when she is thrown out of a caf√© for trying to steal money for food, then attempts to jump into the river. Duke introduces Peggy to his friends as his cousin, and attributes his new good luck to her. After Matt falls for Peggy, both he and Duke convince Mike to hire her as a secretary. While work on the building continues, Peggy dates both Duke and Matt. Duke is promoted to the position of night foreman so that they can speed up demolition by maintaining two shifts. Kemp quits to avoid working with Duke, and while there are many near misses, no one is injured in an accident, convincing Duke that Peggy has broken his jinx. One day after breaking through a wall, Duke finds a cache of hidden money. Duke shares the money with his helper and his pal, Freddy Bunce, who needs money for arm surgery which would help him return to his true vocation as a baseball pitcher. Duke also generously gives Martha some money, saying that it is a donation from the night crew. Later, Matt proposes to Peggy, but she is hesitant to respond because she is torn between him and Duke. One night, Matt catches Duke and Freddy showing off for an audience of women on the sidewalk, and warns Duke to put away the wrecking ball for which Duke is nicknamed. Duke secures the ball, but when he later refuses to rehire Kemp because he is drunk, Kemp angrily releases it. The runaway \\"cannonball\\" severely injures a worker, Emil, and causes structural damage to the building, resulting in the crew's having to reinforce the building before they can continue to take it down floor by floor. After Duke is blamed for the accident and threatens to quit, he asks Peggy to marry him. Convinced that Duke is acting irresponsibly, Peggy rejects him, prompting Duke to pick a fight with Matt, during which Mike learns that Peggy is not really his cousin. Mike breaks up the fight as a section of the hotel wall collapses, rendering the building unstable again. Duke leaves angrily while Matt and the crew try to stabilize the structure. As Matt climbs onto an unsteady girder, a hospital worker informs Mike that after regaining consciousness, Emil named Kemp as being responsible for his injury. Mike tries to call Duke, but he has already moved out of his boardinghouse. Duke again encounters the missionary, who advises him never to falter in helping a friend. Inspired by the advice, Duke returns to the worksite just as a supporting wall collapses and Matt is trapped under a girder. Duke climbs up to save Matt, but is then trapped with his friend when another section of the wall collapses. They are finally saved by Freddy, who, although recovering from his operation, risks his baseball career to throw them a lifeline. Some time later, Matt and Peggy begin their honeymoon at the Empire State Building, and Duke nearly falls off while he is kidding around with Mike.

Since the same partial order was also independently discovered by Robert E Hartwig, some authors refer to it as Hartwig‚ÄìNambooripad order. \\"Natural\\" here means that the order is defined in terms of the operation on the semigroup. In general Nambooripad's order in a regular semigroup is not compatible with multiplication. It is compatible with multiplication only if the semigroup is pseudo-inverse (locally inverse).  Precursors  Nambooripad's partial order is a generalisation of an earlier known partial order on the set of idempotents in any semigroup. The partial order on the set E of idempotents in a semigroup S is defined as follows: For any e and f in E, e ‚â§ f if and only if e = ef = fe. Vagner in 1952 had extended this to inverse semigroups as follows: For any a and b in an inverse semigroup S, a ‚â§ b if and only if a = eb for some idempotent e in S. In the symmetric inverse semigroup, this order actually coincides with the inclusion of partial transformations considered as sets. This partial order is compatible with multiplication on both sides, that is, if a ‚â§ b then ac ‚â§ bc and ca ‚â§ cb for all c in S. Nambooripad extended these definitions to regular semigroups. Definitions (regular semigroup)  The partial order in a regular semigroup discovered by Nambooripad can be defined in several equivalent ways. Three of these definitions are given below. The equivalence of these definitions and other definitions have been established by Mitsch. =Definition (Nambooripad)= Let S be any regular semigroup and S1 be the semigroup obtained by adjoining the identity 1 to S. For any x in S let Rx be the Green R-class of S containing x. The relation Rx ‚â§ Ry defined by xS1 ‚äÜ yS1 is a partial order in the collection of Green R-classes in S. For a and b in S the relation ‚â§ defined by *a ‚â§ b if and only if Ra ‚â§ Rb and a = fb for some idempotent f in Ra is a partial order in S. This is a natural partial order in S. =Definition (Hartwig)= For any element a in a regular semigroup S, let V(a) be the set of inverses of a, that is, the set of all x in S such that axa = a and xax = x. For a and b in S the relation ‚â§ defined by *a ‚â§ b if and only if a'a = a'b and aa' = ba' for some a' in V(a) is a partial order in S. This is a natural partial order in S. =Definition (Mitsch)= For a and b in a regular semigroup S the relation ‚â§ defined by *a ‚â§ b if and only if a = xa = xb = by for some element x and y in S is a partial order in S. This is a natural partial order in S. Extension to arbitrary semigroups (P.R. Jones) For a and b in an arbitrary semigroup S, a ‚â§J b iff there exist e, f idempotents in S1 such that a = be = fb. This is a reflexive relation on any semigroup, and if S is regular it coincides with the Nambooripad order. Natural partial order of Mitsch  Mitsch further generalized the definition of Nambooripad order to arbitrary semigroups. The most insightful formulation of Mitsch's order is the following. Let a and b be two elements of an arbitrary semigroup S. Then a ‚â§M b iff there exist t and s in S1 such that tb = ta = a = as = bs. In general, for an arbitrary semigroup ‚â§J is a subset of ‚â§M. For epigroups however, they coincide. Furthermore if b is a regular element of S (which need not be all regular), then for any a in S a ‚â§J b iff a ‚â§M b.

He was the son of Svante Stensson Sture and M√§rta (\\"King Martha\\") Erikdotter Leijonhufvud. His diplomatic missions included negotiations at the court of Elizabeth I of England in 1561, with John of Finland in 1562, and at the court of Lorraine in 1566/67. As a soldier, he participated in the Nordic Seven Years War's battles of Varberg and Axtorna, where he was wounded, and in the Siege of Bohus. Sture fell into disgrace twice, due to Erik XIV's general distrust of the aristocracy and his astrology-based fear that Sture might usurp his throne. On 15 June 1566, after a death sentence Sture had received was commuted, he was publicly humiliated in Stockholm, where he was forced to ride a wretched hack through town with a straw crown on his head. On 21 May 1567, returning from his final mission in Lorraine, he was arrested again in Uppsala Castle.

He was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1851 but left after completing just one semester to go to Italy. Over the next couple of years he travelled abundantly in Europe, spending his time mainly in France, Spain, Greece and Turkey. In 1955 he made his first non-figurative pictures and had his debut with them at the Kunstnernes Efter√•rsudstilling (autumn exhibition) in Copenhagen. A stay in eastern Greenland during 1959 and 1960 inspired him to paint a series of pictures known as the Kutdleq Suite after his return home. From 1962 he developed a black-and-white geometrical style and created both objects and sculptures in various materials, including marble, granite and steel. In 1970 he became a member of the artists group Gr√∏nningen. Works J√∏rn Larsen's works include a steel sculpture for Odense University (1974‚Äì76) and floor decorations for the Royal Danish Theatre (1992).

In 1664 she gave or bequeathed the library to the Corporation of Barnstaple. The bequest was of 112 volumes, many of which were originally from the library of his uncle Sir John Dodderidge, as evidenced by his signature in several of them. The collection became known as the Bibliotheca Doddridgiana (\\"Dodderidgian Library\\"). A special building was erected to house the books at the north-east corner of the chancel of St Peter's Church, Barnstaple. The books were chiefly in Latin on the subject of theology, and include most notably a 1610 edition of John Foxe's Book of Martyrs, containing a very well preserved illustration of scenes of Protestant martyrdom. The collection was later expanded. The Dodderidge collection was removed to the North Devon Athaneum in 1888 and from there in 1957 on permanent loan to Exeter University Library.

Location Local housing on Minver Crescent It was built on a circular format with a sports playing field in the middle. It consisted originally of four wings, north, south, east and west, each with its own entrance onto Minver Crescent. The North and South sides consisted of both Ambleside Infants/Juniors and Rosslyn Infants/Junior schools. The East and West were a single senior school connected by paths around the playing field. History The William Crane Comprehensive School which was opened in 1930 struggled to provide the required metrics and in 1999 finished joint bottom in the GCSE league tables, with only 4% of the 104 pupils being awarded with five GCSE's A-C's. William Crane eventually went onto close in 2003. In an interview with The Guardian, Russell Andrews, assistant director of education at Nottingham city council, explained \\"What we've got is a multi-layered set of social problems -social unrest where the school is, low morale among staff, low expectations, low input among parents. Had we taken a multi-layered approach to solving the problems five years ago it might have been different.\\" Head teacher from around 1998 until it closed in 2003 was Godfrey Davis.

Bogstad Manor at Bogstad Main Farm. Photographer: J.P. Fagerback Paleet in Oslo Anker, also spelled Ancher, is a Danish and Norwegian noble family living in Norway. The name means anchor. Originally from Sweden, the family became a part of the Patriciate of Norway in the 18th century, and members of the family were ennobled in 1778. Name and origin The family came to Norway's capital Oslo with Erich Olufsen Ancher (1644-1699), who was a representative for merchant Peter Bahrum in L√ºbeck. His parents were trader Oluf Eriksson (‚Ä† 1682) and Kirsten in Gothenburg in Sweden. In Christiania, which was Oslo's name in those days, Erich Ancher became a wealthy trader, and through his marriage with Maren Lauritzdatter, he entered the city's class of rich merchants. Among their sons, priest Bernt Erichsen Ancher (1680-1724) got the sons Erich Berntsen Ancher (1709-1785) and Christian Berntsen Ancher (1711-1765). Due to big trade, purchase of estates, and wealthy spouses, the family became a prominent family within the trading patriciate in Eastern Norway. Members of the two principal branches above were on 14 January 1778 ennobled under the name Anker. They claimed to descend from the Swedish noble family Anckar, but this is not proven. The family name likely derived from their progenitor Oluf Eriksson in Gothenburg, who was an anchor smith. Estates Most of the family members' businesses and properties left their possession during the 1800s. This included the magnificent Pal√©et townhouse in Oslo which was bequeathed to the Norwegian royal family in 1805. The Anker Entailed Estate (Norwegian: Det ankerske Fideikomiss) in Oslo went bankrupt in 1819, and the estate complex related to Bogstad Main Farm and Nordmarka was through women inherited by the families Wedel-Jarlsberg, L√∏venskiold, and Egeberg. Bogstad Main Farm and R√∏d Main Farm were transformed into self-owning foundations in the latest part of the 1900s. Coat of arms Description: On a red shield with a narrow golden edge, a black anchor with a golden anchor stick, and through a black anchor ring three crossed black arrows. On the helm a noble coronet, and above this a six-pointed star between buffalo horns divided in red, gold, and black and in black, gold, and red, respectively. Supporters: On the dexter side a bear, and on the sinister side a wolf. Both have natural colours, and their heads are directed away from the shield. Before the ennoblement, some family members used arms displaying an anchor under two stars, and above the helm the allegorical character Spes between two hart horns. The noble arms were brought closer to the then-extinct Swedish noble family Anckar's arms. Motto Latin: Gloria ex utile.

It flows from the northern slopes of Falls Creek in the Australian Alps, joining with the Cobungra River near Anglers Rest to form the Mitta Mitta River. Course The Big River rises below the ski resort at Falls Creek in the Alpine National Park, on the northern slopes of Spion Kopje at an elevation of above sea level. The river flows north off Spion Kopje, then east in the valley between Spion Kopje and Victoria's highest peak, Mount Bogong, separating Mount Bogong itself from the Bogong High Plains. The river then flows south-southeast, forming the eastern edge of the national park, before turning southward near the Omeo Highway crossing around Glen Valley, north of Anglers Rest. The Omeo Highway then closely follows the course of the Big River until the point where the Bundara River enters it, about north of Anglers Rest. Shortly downstream from this, near Anglers Rest, the Big River forms its confluence with the Cobungra River, with the two rivers becoming the Mitta Mitta River, itself a tributary of the Murray River. The river descends over its course. =Tributaries= Key tributaries of the Big River include Cairn Creek, Beckraith Creek, Camp Creek, Hollonds Creek, Dead Horse Creek, Middle Creek, Glen Wills Creek, Wallaby Creek, Burnside Creek, and the Bundara River. The main tributaries flow off the northern slopes of Spion Kopje, the southern slopes of Mount Bogong, the north, east, and west slopes of Mount Nelse and Mount Nelse North, the eastern slopes of Mount Cope, and the western slopes of Mount Wills and The Knocker. =River health= Devastated bushland alongside the Big River near resulting from the 2003 Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires Most of the waterways in the Mitta Mitta sub-catchment basin are recognised as being in good to excellent condition. Extensive forest covers much of the catchment area. Despite some land clearing and livestock damage to river banks, the aquatic habitat is generally very good. The upper Big River above the Glen Valley is classified as a \\"Representative River of East Victorian dissected uplands\\". In early 2003, large areas of forest around the Big River and its catchments were severely impacted by the Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires. These fires burnt through approximately of the area's bushland for close to two months. The damage resulting from the fires impacted river health for some time after the fires.

Her debut single as Alice Gold, \\"Orbiter\\", was released on 23 September 2010 through Pure Groove Records, with a single launch party at The Drop in Stoke Newington. The Guardian said it \\"showcases Gold's mighty voice through its power-pop chorus\\" and described her as \\"One to watch\\". This was followed by \\"Runaway Love\\", released on Fiction Records, which has received airplay on radio stations across the UK, entering the A-List on BBC Radio 2. On the official release date, 18 April 2011, an acoustic EP was recorded live at Toerag Studios where The White Stripes have previously recorded. Gold's debut album Seven Rainbows, released on 4 July 2011, was produced by Dan Carey (Franz Ferdinand, Hot Chip, Lily Allen). In an interview with PopCultureMonster.com she said of the album, \\"the main bass, drums and guitars rhythm tracks were all recorded live and on tape like the old '60s records. The over-dubs are mostly made up of one-takes, whether it be guitar or vocal takes. My producer Dan Carey and I decided that if a take felt good then we‚Äôd keep it, so it is complete with minor ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô and quirky sounds through doing that, which we both like. It's a very honest album, quite autobiographical. The songs were born from a lot of darkness and grief but the lyrics are drenched in hope because of that, which is why I imagine people connect to it.\\" In October 2010, Gold was shortlisted for Q magazine's 'Next Big Thing' award. In September 2011, Gold's cover of the Billy Fury song \\"Wondrous Place\\" was used in an advert for the British beer brand Carling. She has toured with Eels, Athlete, Band Of Skulls, Noah and the Whale, and The Twilight Singers, and has upcoming tour support slots confirmed with The Dears and The Bookhouse Boys.

Aravindan. A mythological film, its story was adapted from C. N. Sreekantan Nair's play of the same name, which is a reworking of Valmiki's Ramayana. The film interprets a story from the Uttara Kanda of the epic poem Ramayana, where Rama sends his wife, Sita, to the jungle to satisfy his subjects. Sita is never actually seen in the film, but her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a feminist perspective. It was shot in the interior tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. The roles of the epic heroes are played by Rama Chenchu tribal people, who claim lineage to the mythological Rama. Director Aravindan interweaves the Samkhya- Yoga philosophical concepts of Prakriti-Purusha bonds throughout the film. The film was produced by K. Ravindran Nair under the banner of General Pictures. The film features an original score by classical musician Rajeev Taranath, cinematography by cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun, editing by Ramesan, and art direction by Artist Namboothiri. The film became a major critical success upon its release in 1977, although a few mainstream critics panned it. It is credited with being at the forefront of a trend towards independent filmmaking in South India. The film earned Aravindan the National Film Award for Best Direction. Plot The film begins with the journey of Rama and Lakshmana to kill Shambuka ‚Äì the shudra who performs penance ‚Äì but Shambuka's wife pleads for his life, and he is spared. Rama and Lakshmana return to Ayodhya to face Urmila, the spirited wife of Lakshmana. Rama replies to her reproaches for abandoning Sita in the Dandakaranya forests, through which they have just journeyed, that the husband of Sita is only a servant of the people of Ayodhya. The next day, Vasishta arrives to suggest that Rama perform the Ashvamedha yaga (the ritual sacrifice of a horse to Agni, the god of fire) but Rama cannot do without his wife by his side. He is averse to taking a second wife, as Vasishta further suggests. The anguish of Rama at this point is juxtaposed with the people of Ayodhya joyously celebrating the harvest. Bharata, a brother of Rama who had left Ayodhya twelve years ago, returns. He objects to Rama performing the yaga without Sita. Their argument almost culminates in a physical fight, but nature intervenes; the skies open and a cooling rain pours down upon them. The yaga begins, with Lakshmana accompanying the horse. The horse strays into Valmiki's ashram (hermitage), where Rama's son Lava and Kusha are being brought up. Lava stops the horse and is ready to fight Lakshmana (as the yaga demands). Lakshmana orders that the horse be released, but once again nature takes a hand. Valmiki is strangely moved by what he sees, and he begins to compose the Uttara Rama Charita ‚Äì the story of Rama. The horse is led back to Ayodhya, and the ritualistic second stage of the yaga starts. Just then Rama receives the news that Shambuka has resumed his penance, and Lakshmana is despatched to slay the erring shudra. As the ceremony nears completion, Valmiki arrives with Lava and Kusha, but Vasishta debars Valmiki from entering the yagashala. Rama recognises Lava and Kusha as his sons, and takes them to his heart. The joy of Sita, then, is represented in the glorious splendour of nature. =D√©nouement= The film ends with an epilogue depicting Rama's last journey, the Mahaprasthana, as he walks into the river with fire in his hand and becomes one with Sita, the all- pervading nature. When asked whether Rama was really committing suicide, Aravindan replied, \\"Yes... in all probability. That is what I think. However, his death in Sarayu river is not like any other kind of death. It was a Mahaprasthanam ‚Äì an event of supreme self-sacrifice and purification, leaving everything behind. Everyone dear to him had gone. He had parted from Lakshmana. He was troubled by many guilt feelings ‚Äì the murder of Shambuka, the unfairness meted out to Sita... Towards the end of the film, this mood prevails ‚Äì Rama walks into the Sarayu river with the sacrificial fire, bearing everything, including his loneliness, calling out for Sita ... and disappears into the depths of the waters, carrying the sacrificial fire with him into the river is not in Ramayana ‚Äì it is an interpretation. Somehow the part I liked most in the film is this end.\\" Cast * Ramdas as Rama * Venkateswarlu as Lakshmana * Chinna Pulliah as Bharata * Kesava Panicker as Valmiki * Krishnan as Vasishta * Pottiah as Lava * Rangiah as Kusha * Siva as Shambuka * Sobha Kiran as Urmila * Annapurna as Shambuka's wife Themes and analysis The Samkhya-Yoga philosophical concepts of Prakriti-Purusha bonds are used in the film., p.99 Prakriti and Purusha, as philosophical concepts, have their genealogy in the Samkhya-Yoga school of Indian philosophy. In Samkhya thought, Purusha is the Transcendental Self or Pure Consciousness. It is absolute, independent, free, imperceptible, unknowable, above any experience, and beyond any words or explanation. It remains pure, nonattributive consciousness. Purusha is neither produced nor does it produce. Unlike Advaita Vedanta and like Purva-Mimamsa, Samkhya philosophy emphasises the plurality of the Purushas., pp.155‚Äì157 Prakriti is the first cause of the universe ‚Äì of everything except the Purusha, which is uncaused, and accounts for whatever is physical, both matter and force., pp.149‚Äì168 Through its threefold gunas or characteristics of the physical universe, Prakriti binds Purusha, the self (in the minimal sense of awareness or sentience), which itself is not distinct from Prakriti., p.100-101 A written commentary that throws light on Aravindan's interpretation of the play precedes his film proper. The opening scroll reads, \\"This film is an interpretation of the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana. Our mythologies and the epics are constantly re-created in retellings. The epic is the basis for this visual interpretation as well. This film deviates from established norms in how it visualises the protagonists and portrays the course of events in the epic.\\" The scroll explains that the film will try to reflect what it calls the epic's adi-sankalpam (original conception) of the theme and the protagonists. It states that \\"the inner essence of the film is that woman is Prakriti. Ultimately Purusha, here conceived of as the masculine self, dissolves into Prakriti. Ezhuthachan's Adhyathma Ramayana, one of the first Malayalam poems, also views Rama as Purusha and Sita as Prakriti. Aravindan stated in an interview that \\"C. N. [Sreekantan Nair] had made clear the prakriti-purusha notion in Ramayana\\". But Aravindan took the extraordinary cinematic step of representing Sita as Prakriti. =Significance of the title= The title alludes to the golden image of Sita that Rama sets by his side while he performs the Ashvamedha yaga. The yaga, a symbol of imperial power, requires that the king who performs it be accompanied by his wife. Since Rama had abandoned Sita twelve years earlier, the kulaguru (family preceptor), Vasishta, advises that he place a golden image of Sita at his side. Rama Re-filmed, p.? =Differences between the play and Ramayana= Malayalam playwright C. N. Sreekantan Nair wrote his magnum opus play Kanchana Sita in 1961. He took the inspiration for this play from the Uttara Kanda (kƒÅ·πá·∏ça: chapter) of Ramayana. Uttara Kanda is the seventh and last book of Ramayana. It concerns the final years of Rama, Sita, and Rama's brothers,, p.13 and is regarded to be a later addition to Valmiki's original story., p.106 The play is the first of Sreekantan Nair's dramatic trilogy based on the Ramayana. The others are Saketham and Lankalakshmi. A reworking of Ramayana, the play is about the tragedy of power and the sacrifices demanded by adherence to dharma, including abandoning a chaste wife. Kanchana Sita was developed by Aravindan, based on the play. The screenplay and dialogues of the film were written by Aravindan himself. The film is conceived differently from both Nair's play and the original Uttara Kanda of Ramayana. If the Uttara Kanda's critique of sovereign power is buried in the karmic webs of Rama's life, Nair's play carries a sharply materialistic edge in its critique of Kshatriya-Brahminical power. In contrast with both, Aravindan's thematic content is much more directly focused on Rama's inner conflict between moksha (the desire for enlightenment) and artha (the desire for sovereign power). Sita does not appear in the film at all, but is depicted as prakriti, or all-pervading nature, and the different moods of Sita are shown as different aspects of nature. Nair rewrote the final section of Valmiki's Ramayana as a critique of brahminical privilege and political repression. Using Nair's play only a starting point, Aravindan transformed the script according to his interpretation of Indian philosophy and his minimalist aesthetic. He replaced Nair's crisply-articulated exchanges of dialogue with a cinematic meditation on Rama's separation from, and eventual union with Sita, thus carrying the concept of Sita as Prakriti to its visual limit. =Dialogues= The play's main feature is its very eloquent, long, and authoritative dialogues, whereas the film is almost silent. Aravindan explains: \\"There are some specific reasons for deciding to have sparse dialogues in Kanchana Sita. One, this episode taken from Ramayana is familiar to all. Two, Ramayana is not a supernatural reality for us, as it is ingrained in us. It is therefore not necessary to educate people about the film through lengthy dialogues. C. N. [Sreekantan Nair] had made clear the prakriti-purusha notion in Ramayana. I did not think that Sita should come in the film in the form of a woman. That is why Sita appeared in the film as prakriti and Prakriti is a character in the film. When the emotions of Sita like pain, sadness, joy, and equanimity are manifested through the moods of Prakriti, dialogue becomes redundant. I felt I could make the film without dialogue. Rama committing suicide ‚Äì (I still feel it was ‚Äì self immolation) had haunted me very badly. With all these, my Kanchana Sita became very different. Words were required only for very essentials. The dialogues, which I used, were from C. N. [Sreekantan Nair]'s play. The doubt I had then was whether my Rama and Lakshmana (as they were ordinary people) could use such an eloquent Sanskritised language.\\", p.38 In another interview, he said, \\"Dialogues are there to carry on the storyline and make it move. But when it comes to well- known stories, dialogues ceases to be an essential ingredient.\\" Dialogue was, however, included in Kanchana Sita at the end of the movie to discuss the responsibilities of the king., p.61 =Characterisation= The film significantly differs from all other adaptations of Ramayana in the characterisation of the central characters, including Rama and Lakshmana. The characters are humanised, contrary to the way divine characters from Indian mythology are usually depicted in visual media. Aravindan remembered, p.35 Rama has a pot belly, while Lakshmana has pockmarks on his face. In an interview, Aravindan stated, \\"Our sculptures are large in size and exude strength and vitality, which is absent in murals. The Rama of Kanchana Sita exudes the strength and vitality of our sculptures. He is not just a plain frontal image. The wandering tribals we encounter here and there with their medicines also share this quality. I enquired and found that these people are settled in villages near the Godavari River. Apart from this they also believe that they belong to the same race. That is why I cast two of them in my film.\\" Similarly, Aravindan deliberately did not give a superhuman quality to Rama and Lakshmana. Only when they interact with Nature do they rise to the levels of God and go beyond the ordinary. In Aravindan's own words, \\"otherwise they would have been the same as anybody else.\\" Diametrically opposed to this, Valmiki is given an appropriate form and beauty. Production The film was produced by K. Ravindran Nair, who produced some of the most significant films that put Malayalam cinema on the world map. His productions also include memorable films of Aravindan, such as Thampu (1978), Kummatty (1979), Esthappan (1980), and Pokkuveyil (1981). =Casting= In Kanchana Sita, the roles of the epic heroes like are played by Adivasis (tribal members) from Andhra Pradesh known as the Rama Chenchus (also known as Koyas), who claim that they are the descendants of the Ikshvaku clan, to which Rama belonged., p.? Aravindan's idea was not to use conventional actors, but to find people who had reached the state of awareness that the role required. Rama Chenchu healers play the central roles of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Lava, and Kusha. Shambukha was played by a wayside tapasvi, while a destitute woman acted in the role of his wife. The credited cast of the film includes Ramdas, Venkateswarlu, Chinna Pulliah, Kesava Panicker, Krishnan, Pottiah, Rangiah, Siva, Sobha Kiran, and Annapurna. Filmography: Kanchana Sita, p.?, p.90 The name of each village chief is Ramdas. The tribal who acted as Rama is also a village chief., pp.26‚Äì28 Valmiki's character was played by poet and dramatist Kavalam Narayana Panicker's brother Kesava Panicker. Director John Abraham gave voice for this character. When asked how he got the idea to use tribals for the film, Aravindan said, \\"These tribals come to Trivandrum to sell herbal medicine. They are extremely intelligent. In fact, the tribals inhabiting the nine villages around the Godavari river in Andhra are supposed to have the highest I.Q. among Indian tribals. The tribe I selected is known as the Rama Chenchus. They claim to belong to the dynasty of Rama. Physically, I feel, they fit the description given by Valmiki.\\" This experiment in casting resulted in several difficulties during production. A precise detailing had to be done because most of the actors could only react to demonstrated instructions. Communication with the actors was carried out with the help of Manmohan Dutt, painter and lecturer at the College of Fine Arts, Hyderabad. Dutt also accompanied Aravindan and his associate, journalist and filmmaker Chintha Ravi, on a preliminary trip to Andhra Pradesh to finalise the locations., p.103 =Filming= The film was shot in colour in less than three weeks during November and December 1976, entirely in Andhra Pradesh, partly on the banks of the Godavari, partly at Undavalli in Vijayawada, and in the Vicarabad forest belt in Telangana. Aravindan abandoned the typical alternation in setting of mythological films and dance dramas, including Sreekantan Nair's play, by moving Rama's story into the landscape Adivasis, imagining Ayodhya in the forest. Its places are forest caves, its streets are tracks in the wilderness, and its Sarayu river is the Godavari river winding through rural Andhra Pradesh., p.102 Aravindan identified locations away from Rajahmundry, along the expanse of Godavari river and its ribbed red earth banks. Cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun wields the camera. Karun has been a recurring collaborator in Aravindan's films. He was assisted by popular cinematographer S. Kumar who was in his early days of career., p.8 Filming took place at the time when the Emergency was declared in India. Police were combing the entire area around Rajamundhry in their hunt for the Maoist People's War Group. Members of the production team were interrogated by the police several times because they looked different from the natives. The film was completed using simple devices such as table fans to rustle the leaves. A few unexpected things happened for the good while shooting the climax scene. For instance, a rare and unexpected early morning mist on the banks of Godavari made the whole scene ethereal. Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics, but is widely regarded as a landmark film in Indian cinema history. It is credited with the formation of a new trend towards independent filmmaking in South India., p.395 The Hindu described Kanchana Sita as one of the most poetic films in Malayalam. Scholar V. Rajakrishnan noted that Aravindan had not fully considered the implications of locating Rama's story in an Adivasi community. Rajakrishnan pointed out that the rigid economy of expression and the subdued acting styles, which appear to render all dialogue artificial, reduce the element of human drama that is so prominent in Sreekantan Nair's play., p.104 Poet and scholar Ayyappa Panicker views Sita's absence as typical of Aravindan's style, in which there is a conscious, meticulous effort \\"not to communicate in order to communicate\\". Panicker described Aravindan's expressive style using his own concept of antarasannivesa, or the poetics of interiorisation. \\"Sita is not a woman, or an individual, but an eternal concept in the film\\", Panicker said in an interview., p.106 The Hindu critic Sashi Kumar stated, \\"In the film, Aravindan synthesises into a consummate whole his marginality principle and his anthropomorphic contemplation of nature.\\" Vidyarthy Chatterjee of The Economic Times said, \\"Visually stunning in many passages and using sound in such a manner as to make for heightened aesthetic pleasure, Kanchana Sita is a milestone that has unfortunately been bypassed by many who would have done better to focus on its innovative elements\\". Yves Thoraval said, \\"Kanchana Sita is a visually dazzling film illustrating this long mythological episode potentially rich in dialogue but of which G. Aravindan has chosen to make a non-realist, virtually silent and contemplative film by calling up a tribal population to portray the mythological characters\\". Kanchana Sita: The Equation of Woman with Nature, p.402 The National Film Award for Best Direction was given to Aravindan for \\"the film's courageous and uncompromising exploration of an ancient epic theme through a pronouncedly new cinematic language, for making the camera speak more eloquently than the introspective characters of the Ramayana, for projecting against the vast backdrop of nature, for matching profound philosophical ideas with astonishing evocations of the beauties of the physical world\\". 25th National Film Awards, p.?

(1766? ‚Äì 10 January 1827) was a Welsh Unitarian minister, critic, tutor and lexicographer. Life He was born about 1766 near Llandovery, in the parish of Llandingat, Carmarthenshire. His father was a farmer. In 1780, at age 14 or 15, he started study at the ‚Äòcollege of the church of Christ,‚Äô Brecon, under William Griffiths, and remained there till 1783, when his father's death called him home. Soon after the establishment in 1786 of the New College, Hackney near London, he was admitted as a divinity student on the recommendation of his relative, David Jones, who was already a student there. He was a favourite pupil of Gilbert Wakefield, classical tutor. In 1792, he succeeded David Peter as assistant-tutor in the Welsh presbyterian college, then in Swansea, Glamorganshire. With William Howell, the principal tutor, an old-fashioned Arian, Jones, who was of the Priestley and combative, had serious differences. In 1795 the presbyterian board removed both tutors, and transferred the college to Carmarthen. Jones then in 1795 succeeded John Kentish as minister of the presbyterian congregation at Plymouth, Devon, where he remained till 1798. He then established a school at Halifax, Yorkshire. From 29 March 1802 to 1804 he was minister of Northgate End Chapel, Halifax, carrying on a school at the same time. In 1804 he settled in London as a tutor in classics, where his pupils included the sons of Sir Samuel Romilly. He after a time abandoned preaching altogether. He was a member (before 1814) of the Philological Society of Manchester; received (1818) the degree of LL.D. from Aberdeen University; was elected (1821) a trustee of Dr. Daniel Williams's foundations, and (about 1825) a member of the Royal Society of Literature. He died at Great Coram Street on 10 January 1827, and was interred in the burying-ground of St. George's, Bloomsbury, where his gravestone bore a Latin inscription. Works As a Greek-English lexicographer Jones did work which earned the commendation of Samuel Parr. He discarded accents. Instances of alleged theological bias in his interpretations were sharply commented on in the second number of the Westminster Review (April 1824) by John Walker the separatist; Jones fiercely defended himself. He defended the integrity of the passages in Josephus referring to Christ, and maintained that both Josephus and Philo were Christians. The initial chapters of St. Matthew and St. Luke he rejected as interpolations, but he held the Comma Johanneum to be authentic, and to have been excised at an early date because it taught Unitarian doctrine.

Thus, Booknik touches upon many aspects of Jewish and global cultures, ranging from ritual arts to neo-klezmer music, Judeo-Christian polemics to Kabbalah studies, Biblical studies to Reform Judaism, and anti-Semitism to gender studies. The project originators declare their intentions in this way, ‚ÄúWe are as free of religious, political, territorial, language, and other commitments, as we can be, with all due respect to all groups and trends. We are equally interested in both mainstream and marginal aspects of the Jewish culture, in friendly attention and hostile stereotypes.‚Äù The web site's editorial board shares the paradigm of anti- victimity firmly set now in the field of Jewish studies, and the Jewish culture.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines howler, \\"3.3 slang. Something 'crying', 'clamant', or excessive; spec. a glaring blunder, esp. in an examination, etc.\\", and gives the earliest usage example in 1872.Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM, Version 4.0, Oxford University Press (2009). Eric Partridge's Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English says; the 1951 edition of Partridge defined it in part as: \\"... A glaring (and amusing) blunder: from before 1890; ... also, a tremendous lie ... Literally something that howls or cries for notice, or perhaps ... by way of contracting howling blunder.\\" Another common interpretation of this usage is that a howler is a mistake fit to make one howl with laughter.McArthur, Tom & McArthur, Roshan. The Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language. Page 446. Publisher: Oxford University Press 1996 Equivalent terms All over the world, probably in all natural languages, there are many informal terms for blunders; the English term \\"howler\\" occurs in many translating dictionaries.Marie-Helene Correard, Valerie Grundy, Jean-Benoit Ormal-Grenon and Nicholas Rollin. Oxford-Hachette French Dictionary. Publisher: Oxford University Press 2007. M. Clark and O. Thyen. The Oxford-Duden German Dictionary. Publisher: Oxford University Press 1999. There are other colloquial English words for howler in the sense dealt with in this article, such as the mainly United States and Canadian slang term boner, which has various interpretations, including that of blunder. Like howler, boner can be used in any sense to mean an ignominious and (usually) laughable blunder, and also like howler, it has been used in the titles of published collections of largely schoolboy blunders since at least the 1930s. Boner is another colloquialism that means much the same as howler in the context of this article, but its other meanings differ. For one, boner is not traditionally used as a general intensifier, or for specifically describing an accident or similar incidents as howler and howling are. Other assorted terms have much longer histories, and some of them are not regarded as slang. For example, Bull and Blunder have long been used in similar senses, each with its own overtones and assorted extraneous meanings. For example, Bulls and Blunders, an American book published in the 1890s,Brown, Marshall; Bulls and Blunders; S. C. Griggs & Co. Chicago, 2nd ed. 1894 uses the word howler only once, in the passage: \\"Miss A. C. Graham, of Annerley, has received a prize from the University Correspondent for the best collection of schoolboy howlers\\". Although he did not otherwise use the word himself, the author did not define a term so familiar on both sides of the Atlantic even at that time. Mathematics as a special case of terminology In mathematics, the term \\"howler\\" is used to refer to a mathematical fallacy or an unsound method of reasoning which somehow leads to a correct result. However, the distinction between mathematical howlers and mathematical fallacies is poorly defined, and the terminology is confused and arbitrary, as hardly any uniform definition is universally accepted for any term. Terms related to howlers and fallacies include sophism, in which an error is wilfully concealed, whether for didactic purposes or for entertainment. In one sense, the converse of either a howler or a sophism is a mathematical paradox, in which a valid derivation leads to an unexpected or implausible result.\\"number game.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite . Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2011. However, in the terminology of Willard V. O. Quine, that would be a veridical paradox, whereas sophisms and fallacies would be falsidical paradoxes.Quine, Willard Van Orman. The Ways of Paradox. Harvard 1976 Forms of howler Typically such definitions of the term howler or boner do not specify the mode of the error; a howler could be a solecism, a malapropism, or simply a spectacular, usually compact, demonstration of misunderstanding, illogic, or outright ignorance. As such, a howler could be an intellectual blunder in any field of knowledge, usually on a point that should have been obvious in context. In the short story by Eden PhilpottsPhilpotts, Eden; The Human Boy; Pub: Harper & Brothers 1899 Doctor Dunston's Howler, the \\"howler\\" in question was not even verbal; it was flogging the wrong boy, with disastrous consequences. Conversely, on inspection of many examples of bulls and howlers, they may simply be the products of unfortunate wording, punctuation, or point of view. In particular, schoolboy howlers might sometimes amount to what Richard Feynman refers to as perfectly reasonable deviations from the beaten track. Such specimens may variously be based on mondegreens, or they might be derived from misunderstandings of fact originated from the elders, teachers or communities. Not all howlers originate from the pupil. Fields in which howlers propagate As illustrated, terms such as howler need not specify the discipline in which the blunder was perpetrated. Howlers have little special application to any particular field, except perhaps education. Most collections refer mainly to the schoolboy howler, politician's howler, epitaph howler, judicial howler, and so on, not always using the term howler, boner or the like. There are various classes in mood as well; the typical schoolboy howler displays innocent ignorance or misunderstanding, whereas the typical politician's howler is likely to expose smugly ignorant pretentiousness, bigotry, or self-interest (see examples below). The howlers of prominent or self-important people lend themselves to parody and satire, so much so that Quaylisms, Bushisms, Goldwynisms, and Yogiisms were coined in far greater numbers than ever the alleged sources could have produced. Sometimes such lampooning is fairly good-humoured, sometimes it is deliberately used as a political weapon. In either case, it is generally easier to propagate a spuriously attributed howler than to retract one. The popularity of howlers Collections of howlers, boners, bulls and the like are popular sellers as joke books go, and they tend to remain popular as reprints; Abingdon, for example, remarks on that in his preface. People commonly enjoy laughing at the blunders of stereotypes from a comfortable position of superiority. This applies especially strongly when the object of the condescension and mockery is a member of some other social class or group. National, regional, racial, or political rivals, occupational groups such as lawyers, doctors, police, and armed forces, all are stock targets of assorted jokes; their howlers, fictional or otherwise, are common themes. Older collections of cartoons and jokes, published before the modern sensitivity to political correctness, are rich sources of examples.Esquire Cartoon Album 25th Anniversary Volume; Pub: Esquire, Inc. Distributed by Doubleday; First Edition 1956Williams, R. E., Ed.; A Century of Punch; Pub: William Heinemann 1956Cerf, Bennett A.; Laughing Stock; Grossett & Dunlap 1945 Sometimes, especially in oppressed peoples, such wit takes on an ironic turn and the butt of the stories then becomes one's own people. It is very likely that such mock self- mockery gave rise to the term Irish bull (as opposed to just any bull), which is reflected in works such as Samuel Lover's novel Handy Andy.Lover, Samuel; Handy Andy; Pub: H.G. Bohn, London 1853 Similarly, the Yiddish stories of the \\"wise men\\" of the town of Chelm could be argued to be as rich in self-mockery as in mockery. There are many similar examples of mixed mockery and self- mockery‚Äîgood-natured or otherwise.Blaustein, Richard; Teuchters, Newfies and Hillbillies: Comparing Comic Stereotypes in Scotland, Newfoundland and Appalachia; Scottish Affairs, no.46, winter 2004Wehman, Henry J.; Black Jokes for Blue Devils; Pub. Henry J. Wehman, 1897 Throughout the ages and in practically all countries, there have been proverbial associations of given regions with foolishness or insanity, ranging from the Phrygians and Boeotians of classical times, down to the present. Stories of the Wise Men of Gotham are prominent medieval examples. Apocryphally, the men of Gotham feigned insanity to discourage unwelcome attention from the representatives of King John early in the thirteenth century. Their fictitious activities recalled stories from many other alleged regions of dunces and in fact, many recurring stories have been borrowed through the ages from other times and places, either for entertainment or satire. For example, some Gotham stories, variously embellished, are far older than the actual town of Gotham; consider for instance the second one: it concerned the man who, not wishing to overburden his horse, took the load off his horse onto his own back as he rode it. That story dates back much further than medieval times and since the time of the alleged event in Gotham, it has appeared in Afrikaans comics of the mid- twentieth century,T. O. Honiball. Jakkals en Wolf collections ranging from 1942 to 1961, e.g. F. P. Verster. \\"T.O.Honiball: Culture with a Smile\\". and no doubt elsewhere. However, such traditions often grow on histories of tyranny and are nurtured as two-edged weapons; as the men of Gotham reputedly said: \\"We ween there are more fools pass through Gotham than remain in it.\\" Howler propagation and afterlife ‚Äì Ghost words Howlers \\"in the wild\\" include many misuses of technical terms or principles that are too obscure or too unfunny for anyone to publish them. Such examples accordingly remain obscure, but a few have reappeared subsequently as good faith entries in dictionaries, encyclopaedias, and related authoritative documents. In the nature of things, encyclopaedic and lexicographic sources rely heavily on each other, and such words have a tendency to propagate from one textbook to another. It can be very difficult to eradicate unnoticed errors that have achieved publication in standard reference books.Wheatley, Henry Benjamin; Literary Blunders; A Chapter in the ‚ÄúHistory of Human Error‚Äù; Publisher: Elliot Stock, London 1893 Professor Walter William Skeat coined the term ghost-word in the late nineteenth century. By that he meant the creation of fictitious, originally meaningless, words by such influences as printers' errors and illegible copy. So for example, \\"ciffy\\" instead of \\"cliffy\\" and \\"morse\\" instead of \\"nurse\\" are just two examples that propagated considerably in printed material, so much so that they occasionally are to be found in print or in usage today, more than a century later, sometimes in old books still in use, sometimes in modern publications relying on such books. Apart from the problems of revealing the original errors once they have been accepted, there is the problem of dealing with the supporting rationalisations that arise in the course of time. See for example the article on Riding (country subdivision), paying particular attention to the reference to farthing and the sections on Word history and Norse states. In the context of such documented material the false etymology of \\"Riding\\" is particularly illustrative: \\"A common misconception holds that the term arose from some association between the size of the district and the distance that can be covered on horseback in a certain amount of time\\". As a notorious example of how such errors can become officially established, the extant and established name of Nome, Alaska allegedly originated when a British cartographer copied an ambiguous annotation made by a British officer on a nautical chart. The officer had written \\"? Name\\" next to the unnamed cape. The mapmaker misread the annotation as \\"C. Nome\\", meaning Cape Nome. If that story is true, then the name is a material example of a ghost word. As an example of how such assertions may be disputed, an alternative story connects the source with the place name: Nomedalen in Norway. Technical terms and technical incompetence The misuse of technical terms to produce howlers is so common that it often goes unnoticed except by people skilled in the relevant fields. One case in point is the use of \\"random\\", when the intended meaning is adventitious, arbitrary, accidental, or something similarly uncertain or nondeterministic. Another example is to speak of something as infinite when the intended meaning is: \\"very large\\". Some terms have been subject to such routine abuse that they lose their proper meanings, reducing their expressive value. Imply, infer, unique, absolute and many others have become difficult to use in any precise sense without risk of misunderstanding. Such howlers are lamented as a pernicious, but probably unavoidable, aspect of the continuous change of language.Sir Ernest Gowers, Fowler's Modern English Usage, Second Edition. Published: Book Club Associates (1965) One consequence is that most modern readers are unable to make sense of early modern books, even those as recent as the First Folio of Shakespeare or the earliest editions of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. The popularity of nautical themes in literature has provided some conspicuous examples. It has tempted many authors ignorant of the technicalities, into embarrassing howlers in their terminology. A popular example is in the opening line of the song Tom Bowling by Charles Dibdin. It refers metaphorically to a human corpse as a \\"sheer hulk\\". The intent is something like \\"complete wreck\\", which is quite inappropriate to the real meaning of the term. In literature, blunders of that type have been so common for so long that they have been satirised in works such as the short story by Doyle: Cyprian Overbeck Wells, in which he mocks the nautical blunders in the terminology Jonathan Swift used in Gulliver's Travels. Sources and authenticity In contrast to tales representing people's rivals as stupid or undignified, it is easy to believe that many or most schoolboy howlers are genuine, or at least are based on genuine incidents; any school teacher interested in the matter can collect authentic samples routinely. However, it is beyond doubt that the collections formally published or otherwise in circulation contain spurious examples, or at least a high degree of creative editing, as is variously remarked upon in the introductory text of the more thoughtful anthologies. It most certainly is not as a rule possible to establish anything like definitive, pedantically correct versions with authentic wording, even if there were much point to any such ideal. Howlers typically are informally reported, and some of them have been generated repeatedly by similar confusion in independent sources. For example, two members of parliament independently approached Babbage with the same uncomprehending question about his machine.Babbage, Charles; Passages from the Life of a Philosopher; Publisher: Longman, Green, London (1864) Examples and collections of allegedly genuine howlers John Humphrys relates the following example of a journalistic howler: ...The headline above one of the stories on my page read: \\"Work Comes Second For Tony And I\\". In case you did not know, newspaper headlines are written not by the contributors but by sub-editors ... I was shocked. That a sub on the Times should commit such a howler was beyond belief.John Humphrys; John Humphrys Explains Bad English; The Guardian, Monday 20 October 2003 (The howler is that the headline should read, \\"Tony And Me\\", given that they are the object of the sentence; however, see coordinative constructions.) Charles Babbage related his reaction as an intellectual when he wrote: 'On two occasions I have been asked, ‚Äî \\"Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?\\" In one case a member of the Upper, and in the other a member of the Lower, House put this question. I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.' One might see this as a politicians' howler, a layman may so radically fail to understand the logical structure of a system, that he cannot begin to perceive the matching logic of the problems that the system is suited to deal with. One must of course respect the fact that the members concerned had done no worse than reveal their lack of insight into a technical matter; they had not pretentiously propounded personal delusions as fact, which would be more typical of the most notorious howlers perpetrated by politicians. Probably the most prominent anthologisers of howlers in the United Kingdom were Cecil HuntCecil Hunt; My Favourite Howlers; Publisher: Ernest Benn, London (1951)Cecil Hunt; More Hand- Picked Howlers; Illustrator: Blampied; Publisher: Methuen, (1938) and Russell Ash. In the United States, probably the most prominent was Alexander Abingdon. According to Abingdon's foreword to Bigger and Better Boners, he shared material with Hunt at least. However, since their day many more collections have appeared, commonly relying heavily on plagiarism of the earlier anthologies. Here are a few short, illustrative examples of mainly schoolboy howlers culled from various collections: Examples of retention of misinformation, or where information is presented in an unfamiliar context: :* A Cattle is a shaggy kind of cow. (Perhaps a city child had been shown a picture of highland cattle before he knew the word ‚Äúcattle‚Äù. If so, the error was natural.) :* Africa is much hotter than some countries because it is abroad. (To a British child growing up in a cold temperate zone, a natural idea.) :* Poetry is when every line starts with a capital letter. (Even many adults struggle to distinguish poetry from prose after first encountering free verse.) :* The locusts were the chief plague, they ate the first-born. :* All creatures are imperfect beasts. Man alone is a perfect beast. Unfamiliar instruction heard without comprehension frequently leads to mondegreens and malapropisms: :* Hiatus is breath that wants seeing to. (for \\"halitosis\\") :* A gherkin is a native who runs after people with a knife. (for \\"Gurkha\\") Mistranslations from foreign languages happen: :* \\"Cum grano salis\\" means: \\"Although with a corn, thou dancest.\\" (mistranslation from Latin; salis also means \\"of salt\\") :* \\"Mon fr√®re ain√©\\" means: \\"My ass of a brother\\". (mistranslation from French; √¢ne = \\"donkey\\", ain√© = \\"older\\") :* \\"Ris de veau financi√®re\\" (a cookery dish) misrendered from French as \\"the laugh of the calf at the banker's wife\\" :* \\"La primavera es el parte del ano en que todo se cambia.\\" (The pupil neglected a tilde; a√±o means \\"year\\" and ano means \\"anus\\".) Bull: a confusion of wording often related vaguely to a valid idea; not all howlers are bulls in this sense, but the following are: :* The Magna Carta provided that no free man should be hanged twice for the same offence. :* Edward III would have been King of France if his mother had been a man. :* To be a good nurse you must be absolutely sterile. :* Tundras are the treeless forests of South America. In extreme examples of bulls it is hard to guess exactly what the pupil had in mind, or how to correct it. For example: :* Homer was not written by Homer, but another man of that name. Perhaps this stems from some idea that Homer‚Äôs works were written by someone else. Whatever its origin, it is a prime example of how a howler, and in particular the paradoxical aspects of a bull, presumably inadvertently, may constitute deeper comment on the human condition than most deliberate epigrams. Sometimes the pupil simply may have been groping for any answer that might placate the examiner. :* The plural of ox is oxygen. :* The Israelites made a golden calf because they didn't have enough gold to make a cow. :* SOS is a musical term. It means Same Only Softer. :* There are four symptoms for a cold. Two I forget and the other two are too well known to mention. Some howlers are disconcertingly thought-provoking or look suspiciously like cynicism. :* Dictionaries are books written by people who think they can spell better than anyone else. :* \\"Etc\\" is a sign used to make believe that you know more than you do. :* The difference between air and water is that air can be made wetter, but not water. :* What is half of five? It depends on whether you mean the two or the three. As already remarked, not all howlers are verbal: :* One youngster copied down a subtraction sum wrongly, with the smaller number above. As it happened, the date was just above his sum, so he borrowed from his date.

It takes its name from the town of Samolaco, near Chiavenna in the province of Sondrio. Gravely endangered, it is not among the fifteen indigenous horse \\"breeds of limited distribution\\" recognised by the AIA, the Italian breeders' association. The population is listed in DAD-IS as over 12 in 1994, and under 100 in 1998; one further example of the breed may have been identified during a television broadcast. History The Samolaco horse is thought to originate from crossing between indigenous animals and Spanish horses abandoned in about the 17th century by the garrisons of Spanish fortifications in the areas known as Trivio di Fuentes and Pian di Spagna, which were surrendered to Prince Eug√®ne of Savoy in 1706. The FAO describes the breed as a composite of Andalusian and local populations. The horses were usually stabled during the winter and transhumed to higher alpine pasture in summer. Powerful Bruna Alpina oxen were preferred for agricultural and forestry work in the area, and the Samolaco horse was never widely distributed. Production of horsemeat was not economically attractive, and raising of the breed was largely abandoned. The few horses seen in the 1980s were gravely degenerated, with poorly conformed legs and heavy heads; their pale chestnut colouring may be attributed to the systematic introduction of Avelignese blood, which was at first a programme of improvement but effectively became one of outright substitution. The Samolaco is discussed in detail by Fogliata (1910): References Horse breeds Horse breeds originating in Italy ","title":"Samolaco horse"},{"id":"31465165","text":"Huitfeldt Coat of Arms. from Danmarks Adels Aarbog (Anders Thiset. 1887) 250px Huitfeldt is a Norwegian noble family. Name and origin Huitfeldt is originally an old Danish noble family. It came to Norway around 1581 with Anders Huitfeldt (ca. 1555‚Äì1620). In 1582 he married Margrete Pedersdatter Litle, the daughter of Peder Hansen Litle, officer in command at Akershus Fortress, and Ingeborg Nilsdatter Gyllenl√∏ve. Anders Huitfeldt became the owner of the seat farm Tronstad (Tronstad G√•rd) in Hurum in Buskerud, which for 220 years remained in the family's possession. In Denmark, the family's certainly documented paternal line goes back to Henrik Nielsen (fl. 1429) in Ventofte on Funen. During the Middle Ages, the family used the name Hogenskild. Among these are the known knight Claus Hogenskild (fl. 1386) and member of the Council of the Kingdom Lord Peder Hogenskild (ca. 1400‚Äì1478). In 1526, when King Frederik I of Denmark and Norway instructed the Danish nobility to adopt permanent family names, the family took the name Huitfeldt based on their arms. The name consists of the words huit (modern spelling: hvit) and feldt (ditto: felt), meaning respectively white and field. Coat of arms Description: On a white shield a red bend. On the helm alternately five red and five white banners. Hurum Municipality's arms are inspired by the Huitfeldt arms. Hurum Church (Hurum kirke)  Lying by Hurum Church (Hurum kirke) is the grave chapel for the Huitfeldt family, which in the early 1660s was constructed under T√∏nne Huitfeldt and which was renovated in 1750. The chapel has one of the country's biggest and richest collections of coffins. Naval hero and native son, Ivar Huitfeldt (1665-1710) was buried in the church yard. The pulpit was received as a gift from his wife, Kirsten R√∏yem Huitfeldt (1671‚Äì1750). See also * Huitfeldt * Danish nobility * Norwegian nobility References Literature * H.J.

Registered in Bideford, North Devon, but presently based in Liverpool, she is listed as part of the National Historic Fleet. History She was built in 1900 by Ferguson and Baird at their Connah's Quay, Flintshire yard, for local shipping company Coppack Bros. Constructed with a doubled frame of oak, these were covered by thick seasoned pitch pine planks, fastened to the frames with treenails and iron bolts. Equipped with the first known fitting of Appledore roller reefing, the sails are reefed by a ratchet lever that engaged the cogs on the Gaff boom, thereby winding the sail around it, and then locked to prevent the sail unwinding from the boom. Launched in April 1900 under Captain John Coppack, she was named Lizzie May after the Captain‚Äôs daughters. Placed to work on the Irish Sea, by 1908 she had sailed nearly , when she was sold into the coal-shipping fleet of Martin J Fleming of Youghal, Ireland, and renamed the Kathleen and May after his daughters. Fleming modified her, adding before World War I both a longer lower yard to lengthen the middle sail, and a martingale fitted to the bowsprit. She now plied her trade between Youghal and the ports of the Bristol Channel, as a coal lugger. In 1931 she was sold to Captain Jewell of Appledore, North Devon. On arrival in her new home port, she was fitted with an Beardmore diesel engine, and with her topsails removed her topmasts were reduced in height. After surviving the storms of February 1936, in 1937 she experienced engine trouble in sight of Youghal‚Äôs lighthouse, but managed to make port. In 1943, her engine was upgraded to a Deutz diesel. After the death of Captain Jewell in 1945, she passed to his son Tommy. In 1947 he had the martingale removed, but continued to ply her on the Irish Sea coal trade, which was now in severe decline. Restoration Restored bow sprit of Kathleen & May, beside the quay in Whitehaven She was acquired by a film company in the early 1960s, used in a small number of films and then laid up in Southampton Water, where she was spotted in 1966 by master mariner Capt WP (Paul) Davis, a James Fisher skipper. He sold most of his collection of vintage and veteran motor cars to raise the money to buy her. With a crew of one (a retired agricultural engineer, McKenzie (Ken) Morgan), Paul sailed her around the coast to Appledore, where she was berthed on the mud in the estuary outside the port (to avoid port dues). Paul resigned his post with James Fisher and spent the next five years working on the restoration of the schooner with the help of friends, financed by the sale of more of his collection of vintage cars and on occasion by work conducting sea trials on new vessels for Appledore shipbuilders. Paul's ambition was to restore her to working condition and then to ply the Bristol channel as a merchantman again, but the job proved too big a challenge and in 1970 he sold her to the Maritime museum. The Duke of Edinburgh in a bid to preserve a number of examples of Britain's decaying maritime heritage set up the Maritime Trust in London. The Trust moved her to Gloucester Docks, and began restoring her as a typical West Country schooner., but failed to secure a ¬£2 million National Lottery Heritage Fund grant. Businessman Steve Clarke from Bideford, Devon then bought her. Towed by sea to Bideford, in February 1999 she was hauled out of the water by two heavy lift mobile cranes, and placed on to the disused Brunswick Wharf at East-the-Water. 70% of the original planking was stripped from the frames, enabling most of her internal timbers to later be refitted. While the stern of the ship was stripped down to the keels, the reconstruction of the bow required the replacement of of sacrificial oak timber. Once the frames were refitted, the surviving parts of the original frames were steam cleaned at 3000psi, to kill fungal spores. The ship was fitted with a Detroit diesel ex-lifeboat engine, and the single propeller was replaced by a pair of hydraulically driven propellers. The ship now carries enough fuel to do under engine power alone. Redecked with new seasoned timbers, she was given a second refit, with all masts and rigging restored to the originally constructed and researched 1900 specification. On completion, she underwent a rigorous MCA CAT2 inspection. As a result of his efforts in restoring Kathleen and May, Councillor Steve Clarke was awarded the OBE in 2008. Present A restored Kathleen & May returns to Cardiff Bay in 2003, with the St David's Hotel & Spa in the background Based in Bideford on the River Torridge, since her restoration Kathleen & May now regularly sails across the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea. She has returned to Youghal, attended various festivals, and sailed across the Bay of Biscay to Bilbao as the paid guest of the Guggenheim museum. Since 2010 Kathleen & May is berthed in Albert Dock beside Merseyside Maritime Museum.

(November 18, 1906January 26, 1989) was a Spanish Jesuit, philosopher and author who spent 40 years as a missionary among the Yup'ik in the most remote parts of Alaska. In 1960, he won a seat in the 2nd Alaska State Legislature as a write-in candidate, becoming the state‚Äôs first Catholic priest elected to office, as well as one of two write-in candidates elected that year from rural Alaska. He wrote hundreds of essays and one dozen autobiographical books in Spanish and English about his life in Alaska. Llorente is called the \\"favorite son\\" of his hometown, Mansilla Mayor. Early life in Spain =Childhood and youth= Segundo Llorente Villa was born on November 18, 1906 in Mansilla Mayor, a little town in the Province of Le√≥n in northwestern Spain. He was the eldest of nine children in the family of Luis Llorente and Modesta Villa, who were farmers. When he was 13 years old, he entered the diocesan seminary of Le√≥n. He felt called to the Society of Jesus and in 1923, at age 17, began his novitiate in the Jesuit seminary of Carri√≥n de los Condes in the province of Palencia. This seminary would also educate his brother Amando, a Jesuit who became a teacher and mentor to Fidel Castro, and later was a chaplain and director of spiritual services for the U.S. Army in Miami. =Missionary vocation= During his novitiate years, Llorente‚Äôs devotion to his chosen career solidified. Young and passionate, he became obsessed with the Territory of Alaska which, by his own accounts, was considered the most isolated, difficult, and challenging of all Catholic missions. His superiors recommended his appointment to a mission in Anqing, China, but he refused. Thus, he had to wait. While studying humanities and Latin at Salamanca (1926) and philosophy in Granada (1927), he entered into deep religious and philosophical discussions. Finally in 1930, at age 24, he received permission to go to Alaska due to his determination and persistence. Life in the United States =Education= After arriving in America, Llorente attended Gonzaga University, a Jesuit institution in Spokane, Washington, to learn English. Becoming proficient, he began teaching at Gonzaga Preparatory School in the same city. He started writing his first articles at the same time, which were published in the religious journal Century Mission. In 1931, he studied theology at St. Mary's College in Kansas. In June 1934, at age 28, he became an ordained Roman Catholic priest and traveled to Alma, California, where he continued his religious studies at the former Alma College as well as at Santa Clara University. =In the \\"Arctic Circle\\"= In the fall of 1935, Llorente arrived in Alaska. His first mission was at Akulurak, on the south bank of the Yukon River Delta near the Bering Sea coast. It was here that he first experienced difficulties in the frozen arctic tundra, since not only did he have to learn the extremely difficult dialects of the Yup'ik language, but he had to introduce the concept of God to people with a psychology and conception of the world radically different from Europeans. However, these were exactly the challenges that had attracted him to Alaska in the first place. In this missionary posting, Llorente traveled along the Kuskowkim River drainage, where he served in Bethel and as far upriver as McGrath. In 1938, he was assigned to the far north mission of Kotzebue, on the end of the Baldwin Peninsula in Kotzebue Sound. In 1941, he returned to Akulurak and was named Superior, where he served until 1948. Llorente served numerous remote parishes based in Bethel during the next three years, returning to the Akulurak district in 1951. After 21 years in Alaska, in 1956, he became a U.S. citizen in Nome. Most of Llorente's best known stories about experiences in Akulurak, Alakanuk, Bethel, and Kotzebue are recounted in his books Memoirs of a Yukon Priest and Cuarenta a√±os en el c√≠rculo Polar (\\"Forty Years in the Arctic Circle\\"). In October 1952, he was honored by being selected to attend the Third Congress of Missions in Monterrey, Mexico, which is discussed in his book Trineos y eskimales (\\"Sleds and Eskimos\\"). =State Representative= In 1958, the Territory of Alaska became the 49th state of the United States by virtue of the passage of the Alaska Statehood Act by the U.S. Congress. The results of the already- conducted territorial primary elections (described by Alaskan historian R. N. DeArmond as \\"the lost primary\\") were abandoned and elections for state offices were called by territorial governor Mike Stepovich, who resigned from office to launch a campaign for the U.S. Senate, challenging eventual winner Ernest Gruening. Under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, statehood was officially proclaimed on January 3, 1959, which was also the first day of the 86th United States Congress. The second elections for state offices occurred in 1960. Fr. Llorente was already serving his community in a minor function in the remote Wade Hampton electoral district where 90% of the population was Eskimo. Given the great affection that he had for Native Alaskans, they set out to elect him as their state representative as a write-in candidate rather than one of the candidates promoted by the state political parties. Upon Fr. Llorente‚Äôs surprising election, his religious superiors accepted his election after reviewing his mission, and he became the first Catholic priest elected to a state legislature. His term of office coincided with the term of John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic president of the United States, and there was speculation about influence by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, however, nothing came of it. Llorente‚Äôs election was eventually recognized as one of the first occasions where the political desires of Native Alaskans became reality. The entire tumultuous episode was followed by the Associated Press and Time magazine, which spread news about his election around the world. =Later career and death= Fr. Llorente returned to Spain only once, in 1963, on a trip designed to encourage vocations in the priesthood. He wrote twelve books about Alaska throughout his life, all but one in Spanish, although he was perfectly fluent in English. (He could converse in Yupik, however he said it never amounted to more than \\"patter\\".) His final assignments took him to posts in Nome, Cordova, and Anchorage. He retired at age 68, in 1975, after 40 years of service to the Alaska missions, and was transferred to Moses Lake, Washington where he worked with the local Hispanic community. He became assistant pastor at St. Joseph's Church in Pocatello, Idaho in 1981, and three years later, he was chaplain at St. Joseph's Hospital in Lewiston, Idaho. Llorente died at Jesuit House in Spokane, Washington on January 26, 1989 at age 82 and was buried in a Native American cemetery in De Smet, Idaho, where he was interred by request on January 30, 1989. Bibliography Llorente wrote hundreds of deeply moving and engaging essays with unusual cheerfulness about his challenging religious vocation in extremely frigid and difficult conditions. In letters and articles, he described the day-to-day lives and stories of Eskimo peoples that were published in mission journals, mainly in the now defunct \\"Century Mission.\\" Selected articles were later compiled, which led to the publication of autobiographical books in both Spanish and English. Cuarenta a√±os en el c√≠rculo Polar (\\"Forty Years in the Arctic Circle\\"), his best known work, is an anthology of his previous books. It was compiled by Fr. Jos√© A. Mestre, who also was a Jesuit. In the volume‚Äôs prologue and epilogue, his brother Fr. Amando Llorente called him \\"Hercules of God and the Missions\\" (H√©rcules de Dios y de las Misiones) who was happy to be a priest that would not keep anything from God. Fr.

Early life  Radha Kishan was born in 1925 in a family of farmers on Krishna Janmashtami in Bid village (currently in Harda district, Madhya Pradesh). Radha Kishan first saw Mahatma Gandhi in December 1933 when Gandhi visited Harda. It was his passion for studies that he got himself enrolled for studies in a school at Chipawad near Khirkiya, which was miles away from his native village. Though he had to experience the hardships of the life very early in his life as his father died while he was a child, but his love for his nation drive him for what he did in his life to come. In the school he read a book authored by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin on the revolutionary struggle of Russia and an article about Indian Independence movement activists Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil, Sukhdev Thapar, Bhagat Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad. Influenced by the martyrdom of the revolutionaries he left his studies to join the Independence struggle of India after hoisting the tricolour Independence flag in his school and for his this act he was sent to a reformatory school by the British colonial authorities. This was the beginning of his revolutionary career which inspired him to leave his native place with the intentions to do something for his country as said by Mahatma Gandhi in his speech at Harda.  Early career  Social reformist, philosopher and member of Constituent Assembly of India, Shankar Trimbak Dharmadhikari popularly known as Dada Dharmadhikari was first major personality to notice Kishan's patriotism and dedication for the Independence movement. Dada sent a patriotic message to Kishan when he came to know about the courage shown by him during a protest rally against colonial government. Independence movement had acquired momentum in Madhya Bharat when this young firebrand activist Radha Kishan publicly challenged a British Police official and slapped him in front of a large gathering while the officer started abusing the activists at an Independence movement rally in Indore. Guru Radha Kishan was imprisoned in the notorious Mahidpur jail where he was in solitary confinement in terrible conditions. He always protested against insane British laws. As one of the youngest activist from Madhya Pradesh he spent months in prison after being under grounded for more than two years. His colleagues includes Homi F Dazi, former MP from Indore and General Secretary of All India Trade Union Congress, Independence activists Ram Chandra Sarvate, Prof. Mahesh Dutt Mishr, Member of Constituent Assembly of India Vinayak Sarvate, Vinayakrao Sahasrabudhe, Sarjoo Pandey, eminent painter N S Bendre, Anant Laagu and award winning writer from Malwa region Shivnarain Shrivastava, author of ek sair gehun. The social movement started by these activists against British government got easy sustenance and firm roots between the masses of Indore and Madhya Bharat as issues of economic and social deprivation were also highlighted by them.  Narmada Ke Sacche Sapoot  In an address Governor of Madhya Pradesh, Mohammad Shafi Qureshi said about him that: \\" Freedom fighter and social worker of unconditional integrity Guruji is a noble soul with a pious heart. People like him are extremely rare in the society today, it's an honour to facilitate such a selfless individual. Despite political differences, former president of BJP Kushabhau Thakre praised Guru Radha Kishan as Narmada ke Sacche Sapoot mentioning his selfless social work and dedication for the underprivileged class. Thakre also known for his simple lifestyle in political circles once stated about Guru Ji that he was a gandhian in politics with no ambitions for himself or his family at all. Prior to this, on many occasions Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and senior Congressman Prakash Chandra Sethi requested him to accept the Freedom Fighter Pension, which he humbly but strongly denied. He was entirely not interested to accept any pension for his participation in the Independence struggle of India. This sets him apart from many other Independence activists who held high offices in independent India is his complete insulation from material desire. He refused to accept any pension and never applied for the same till it was declared as Sammaan Nidhi by the government. Only after being declared as Samman Nidhi he accepted the recognition from the government for being an Independence activist even when he had no source of income and would not accept any favours from any well wisher.  Mass Organisations and Communist Party  After India gained independence Kishan undertook a fast unto death for 24 days to promote the cause of textile workers in Delhi prior to becoming the youngest member of Delhi Municipal Committee. The first elected mayor of Delhi and noted Independence activist Bharat Ratna Aruna Asaf Ali was so impressed by his simplicity and selflessness that she started calling him Guru Bhai. Before Independence he was involved in mobilising youth and organising trade union activities in textile mills and unorganised sectors at various locations for All India Trade Union Congress primarily in Indore, Kota and Gwalior to name a few. This was continued in Delhi during 1948-50 where he worked prominently to unite the workers in textile, municipal and unorganised sectors when there was a crackdown on communists nationwide. In fact the idea of uniting unskilled labour of unorganised sector and his exceptional organising capabilities made him so popular in political and social circles that workers and colleagues started calling him Guruji. He was arrested many times for social causes, for leading under privileged class, textile employees, during general strikes and even for a strike of Delhi Police. He worked with prominent communists and social activists of that era like Aruna Asaf Ali, Mukimuddin Farooqui, Devdutt Atal, H L Parwana, Nuruddin Ahmed, Yagya Dutt Sharma, Vimla (Kapoor) Farooqui, Premsagar Gupta, Pandit Madan Mohan, Ram Chandra Sharma, N N Manna, Shaadi Lal, Janardan Sharma, B D Joshi, Shakeel Ahmad, Sarla Sharma and educationists like Prof. Nand Lal Gupta to erect and lead the communist movement in Delhi. As first state president of the youth wing of Communist Party, Kishan always encouraged young political and social activists and nurtured them to be in forefront throughout his life. When P K Vasudevan Nair and Balraj Sahani conveyed him about the idea of All India Youth Federation he actively participated in organising the first national conference of AIYF in Delhi. About 250 delegates and observers representing several youth organizations of eleven states of India attended this six-day session and the event was a huge success. His wholehearted sincere efforts were visible when strong presence of the organisation was noticed by E.M.S. Namboodiripad, Telangana hero Chandra Rajeswara Rao and other prominent leaders. Balraj Sahani was named first President and Sarda Mitra was elected as general secretary of AIYF.  Social and Public Representation  As an opposition stalwart and leader of the CPI, Guru Radha Kishan's speeches in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi were marked with positive criticism and earned him the admiration of even his political opponents. Never enamoured of office, he was severely blunt about government's failures and raised many an eyebrow among the benches with his frank observations and constructive reasoning. Kishan was very close to the masses and a known champion of the causes of underprivileged people while serving as Municipal Councillor of Delhi. He also served as member of various administrative committees for state and central government with equal distinction. That was the impact of Guruji between the masses of his area that even in 1977 when Janta Party swept away the polls almost everywhere he won the civic body elections from his constituency and being the senior most in the house he presided over the house as pro tem Mayor of Delhi. Kishan represented India in Germany leading a delegation to D√ºsseldorf. He discussed about the welfare plans for working class in Germany and briefed about Indian Civic System to his counterparts from other countries. Returning from Europe he enforced Delhi administration and MCD officials to adapt many of those welfare schemes for a better life of working class in Delhi. People from all walks of life come out to support Guru Radha Kishan when Communist Party of India announced his candidature from Delhi Sadar Parliamentary Constituency in 1977, the same year he successfully contested the civic body polls also. He was the firm believer of the fact that only the education can bring the changes in the underprivileged people of the society, he took the initiative to bring the first Janta Library in his constituency which was inaugurated by Sh. Balraj Sahni, an eminent film personality in the presence of the writers Amrita Pritam, Bhishm Sahani, Santosh Anand, painter Narayan Shridhar Bendre and social activist Aruna Asaf Ali. Guru Ji's firm belief that education is a must for progress in the life has paved the way for a social centre at Guru Radha Kishan Smarak Bhavan, Clock Tower in Delhi, where his family still resides.  Independent and Secular India  Radha Kishan worked for communal harmony during his six-decade-long political life; when violence in Delhi was triggered by the assassination of Indira Gandhi on 31 October 1984 by two of her Sikh bodyguards, Guru Radha Kishan came out on the streets of Delhi to save innocent Sikhs in the worst-affected regions of Delhi. He worked to protect Sikh families even when his office caught fire in Delhi during that period. Guruji along with other persons from the civil society came forward to provide immediate relief for the suffering Sikh community. A powerful speaker and voracious reader himself, Guru Radha Kishan continued to read and analyze on several social issues, secularism, political extremism and communist ideological issues till his death. He was against communalism and worried by the rise of the communal forces in our secular state. He always stood firm in fighting against any kind of terrorism to counter the threat from the divisive forces. He was first to criticise the extremism and applauded the glorious chapter of sacrifice made by Communists in fighting extremism in Punjab under the leadership of his colleague and Punjab MLA Darshan Singh Canadian. Guru Radha Kishan severely criticised HKL Bhagat and MP from Karol Bagh Dharam Das Shastri for their alleged role in anti-Sikh riots even when they were very closely associated with him personally. Till he passes away he strongly believed and condemned 1984 anti-Sikh riots along with 1947 Partition riots and Babri Masjid demolition. Ideally, according to him they were the worst incidents in independent India and any such incidents should not have happened at any cost.  Recognition  Guru Radha Kishan.. a final tribute Addressing a large gathering at Ghantaghar Chowk in Delhi after his death on January 10, 1996 Madan Lal Khurana, Delhi Chief Minister said \\" No house of his own to live, no money, simple lifestyle and total commitment for public life to serve selflessly the people, specially poor and deprived class makes Guru Radha Kishan a perfect example to follow in public life and politics. \\" Kisi se koi man-bhaid nahin chhahe kitne bhi raajnaitik mat-bhaid hon. Guruji was a constant source of support for all progressive people of Delhi, a true saint in the politics.\\" The Leader of Opposition of Delhi Assembly Jagpravesh Chandra said \\" If you ask me to name any other politician like him in Delhi its extremely difficult for me because Guru Radha Kishan was a gandhian in approach and a true communist in his ideas. He was a man of masses, a role model for integrity and honesty in public life.\\" Former Union Minister and Delhi Sadar MP Jagdish Tytler added \\" Guruji never asked for any personal favour from anyone ever, he will keep guiding us as he will survive in our hearts forever.\\" Home Minister of India Indrajit Gupta, also present at his funeral ceremony called this as severely painful personal loss. He further added that it was a great loss for the underprivileged class and communist movement as a whole and for the members of All India Trade Union Congress in Delhi specially. Communist historian Anand Gupta wrote in a special mention about him \\"Guruji was always so involved with the people that often he had no time for the basic requirements of his own life.\\" In short, he was always available for the general public and the underprivileged class of the society. M Farooqui, Sudhakar Reddy MP, Abani Roy, Politburo Member CPM and MP S. Ramachandran Pillai, National Secretary CPI and MP J Chittranjan, President of Delhi State Congress and Member of Congress National Working Committee Deep Chand Bandhu, Film actor-wrestler and MP Dara Singh, Journalist Prabhash Joshi and E Srinivasan, Secretary Government of India were also present to give the final salute to this Swatantrata Sangram Sainik. National Minorities Commission Member Harcharan Singh Josh remembered him as a man of principles and impeccable integrity with a pious soul, he added \\"Guruji always condemned any discrimination based on the religion or caste and worked for substantial improvements in the position of underprivileged people.\\" Prominent Communist Prem Sagar Gupta said that \\" Guru was a man of masses and loved to be with them. Though not much has been said about him despite his exceptional service to the nation pertaining to his period, his dedication for red flag and communist movement, passion for social work and organisational capabilities will be remembered for a long time by communist cadre and masses.\\" Loksabha Speaker PM Sayeed, Aruna Asaf Ali, Com. P K Vasudevan Nair, Com. Homi F Dazi, NFIW leader Vimla Farooqui, Union Minister Chaturanan Mishra, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh, Independence activists Chaudhary Ranbir Singh Hooda, Sheelbhadra Yazee, Sarla Sharma, BD Joshi, Mohammad Shafi Qureshi, Chaudhary Prem Singh, Former Union Minister Rajesh Pilot, HKL Bhagat, Santosh Anand, Kedar Nath Sahani, Brijmohan Toofaan, Guru Hanuman, Purshottam Goyal and Viresh Pratap Chaudhary send their condolences to the family. Many social and religious leaders apart from other dignitaries from major political parties, social outfits and trade unions also attended the gathering to pay final tribute to him.  Wife and Child  right Guru Radha Kishan was ably supported by his better half Sunita Sharma throughout his life. His family was arrested so many times for social and political reasons but his wife Sunita Guru, herself a prominent NFIW activist even though came from a rich family of landowners neither regretted nor complained about this lifestyle and always supported him. She held various positions in NFIW and lead from the front to serve the people, be it the relief camps organised by NFIW for flood effected people or the Shanti March after 1984 Sikh riots. She was a source of constant encouragement for college students and women volunteers during mass movements and election campaigns. She treated them like her family and always ensured the safety and timely meals for them, so many times she has to cook for them herself which she happily did. She worked rigorously to organise the first Shanti March in Delhi and ensured a noticeable participation of Sikhs and their families demanding immediate relief for Sikh community and severe prosecution for the killers. Several human rights organizations along with the media applauded this humanitarian act of her and comrades. Like her husband she always followed the path of simplicity and impeccable integrity and insisted others to follow the same course in public life. She suffered a lot and had very tough times but she never compromised with her principles. Neither she demanded nor accepted any favours from anyone throughout her life. Born at Saharanpur on 2 March 1939 in a Zamindaar family, Sunita zealously started working for the underprivileged after her marriage and remained involved with NFIW and Communist movement till her eternal sleep on Deepawali, 13 November 2012. Amarjeet Kaur, Secretary CPI National Council, Senior Communist Ramsaran Ram, Prof. Dinesh Varshney and Dhirendra Sharma, Secretary Delhi Communist Party were among the people and Social activists gathered to pay her the last tributes. His son Sameer Sharma Guru is an advocate of Social Justice. Sameer Guru, presently a member of Centre for Environment and Social Empowerment started his career with The Independent Media Group. His writings on Socio-Legal issues and work for Structural Stability of Buildings, Vrindavan Widows and Underprivileged Elders in the society talks about his personality.  Legacy  English daily The Hindustan Times wrote in an article about him: > Despite being a prominent politician of Delhi he was always accessible to > public, a man of masses loved by every class of the society. Guru Radha > Kishan fought valiantly for the economic deprivation for the poor and the > issues of social deprivation in Delhi.

The UK Government decided that there was a need to centralise the construction of school buildings in order to save money and improve standards., Rationing limited materials available and meant that a programme for rebuilding schools, and building new schools for the expanding population, had to be phased, and carefully managed. Formed by the merger of the Architects Branch and the Buildings and Priority Branch of the Ministry of Education, the department brought together both administrative personnel and professional architects into one multi-disciplinary team.  Structure  The Branch began as a team of \\"territorial\\" architects.Saint, Andrew. Towards a Social Architecture; the role of school-building in post-war England. (New Haven, 1987). and was later split into two sections; the Territorial, and Development teams, headed by Stirrat Marshall-Johnson, and Anthony Pott respectively. The purpose of the Territorial team was to work with local authorities and private architects on the approval of school plans. Their work was often very technical, with some visits and involvement of educational advisors. The Development team investigated technical and educational matters and designed and built schools for local authorities. Effectively, the Development team were an action research body whose findings are used and applied by the Territorial architects. Their work was used for reference by the Branch and round the world, areas they investigated include buildings furniture and components, and publications. Investigations were not limited to the UK, visits were made to other countries including France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Activity The Branch designed and built around 30 educational buildings and schools during their period of operation. They were revolutionary in their consideration of the child as the most important client. The Branch commissioned some of the first measurements of school children in order to create spaces, and furniture designs that would aid children's learning. Every part of a school was designed by the Branch; ironmongery, light fittings, furniture, heating, outdoor play areas. Assistance from the relevant industries was sought and throughout its existence the department worked in close collaboration with Local Authorities and other organisations such as the Furniture Industry Research Association to ensure their work was suited to the purpose it intended.

Here are some of the initiatives undertaken in the past few editions. =Guwahati Half Marathon (GHM)= Guwahati Half Marathon The Guwahati half marathon initiative was started on 30 August 2009 with an aim to unify the north-east. It witnessed a huge participation in the two events proposed in the debutante year ‚Äì The Glory Run (18 km) and The Dream Run (6 km). In 2010, Techniche introduced a 21-km cycle race with the motto of shaping the youth's attitude towards the environment with the motto \\"Youth for environment\\". As the years unfolded, the initiative grew, now standing as the largest of its kind in north-east India. For the first time, a new category of marathon was introduced, namely, the Courage Run for specially-abled participants. The illustrious Amit Kumar Saroha, Shimit Amin, and Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra were invited to spread the marathon's motto \\"Run for Peace\\" (in 2015), \\"Run to affect the shift\\" (in 2014) and \\"Run for a better tomorrow\\" (in 2013) respectively. Their support was integral in drawing large crowds to the event. Special attendees to the event include singer Zublee Baruah, cricketer Akash Chopra and the world's largest parkour group \\"American Parkour\\", and a coverage of the events were provided by Assam Tribune and NDTV India. Later in 2014, a college championship was also introduced to inspire young students to hone their athletic skills. = Pragati = This initiative, pioneered during Techniche 2015, was inspired by the Government of India's call for every IIT to adopt a neighbouring village, with the vision of transformational change in rural India. The students from the IIT campus undertake several developmental projects in the rural villages of Assam. One of these is the setting up of bio-toilets and clean drinking facilities in the villages, an important step towards achieving the vision of a smart village. Also, in collaboration with the Technical Board of IIT Guwahati and support from NGOs, energy efficient, solar street lights were installed in the villages. Another important facet of the initiative is its mission to educate schoolchildren in rural areas and make them conversant in modern technology. Students from the IIT campus visit the rural villages of Assam, including the campus' adopted village of Lathiya Bagicha, and educate the elementary schoolchildren on fundamental subjects like science, using simple experiments and projects. The adults of the village were helped in other ways, like teaching them about cashless transactions. Some of the villages covered under this initiative are Dolibari, Dadara, Singimari and Hajo. =Wake Up and Vote= The Wake Up and Vote campaign was launched in the wake of the 2014 Indian General Election, in order to build awareness among citizens about their right to vote, and how they could exercise that right. Organized in cities as well as towns, the initiative has reached over 2 lakh people, as of 2018. The initiative has been endorsed by celebrities like Mary Kom and Sushmita Sen.https://techniche.org/initiatives#wuav A video-making competition was also organized as a part of this initiative. =Muskaan= An attempt to lighten up special hearts on the occasion of Diwali, Techniche invites children from the Shishugram Orphanage to the IIT Guwahati campus. Here, they participate in and are taught activities like lantern-making and diya painting. A Rangoli competition is also organized as a part of the initiative. Techniche organized the third edition of MUSKAAN in IIT Guwahati with the theme \\"Spreading Smiles\\". =Litre of Light= \\"Lighten up someone's life and you have at-least lightened some part of the world\\". The Litre of Light campaign was initiated to illuminate the homes and streets of the rural areas of Assam. On 9 March 2014, team Techniche successfully organized the \\"Litre of Light\\" event in the Bhutnath slum locality near Guwahati city. The invention, being relatively simple, involves filling up a 1.5-litre PET bottle with purified water and bleach and installing it onto the roof of a house. As the water inside the bottle refracts the sunlight during the daytime, it creates the same intensity as a 55-watt light bulb used in modern houses. Economic and eco-friendly lights like these were set up in multiple households in the locality In 2018, over 100 LED street lights were set up in over 50 villages, providing around 40-45% in energy and monetary savings. Also, over 50 low-cost, easy to install lights were placed in rural homes across Assam. =Blood donation camp= Recognized by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), this student campaign raises awareness on the importance of blood donation. As a part of the initiative, the team conducts blood donation camps in the IIT Guwahati Hospital, during the three days of the festival. =Health Camp= The initiative aims at inspiring the local people about health. The volunteers, with the help of few medical practitioners, roam in the nearby villages wherein proper hospital facilities are set up and provide free medical services.

The rules governing play were based on the London Football Association's 1863 rules that disallowed carrying or throwing the ball. For spectators, therefore, the game more closely resembled soccerFirst ever college soccer football game on Pro Football Hall of Fame than gridiron football. Moreover, the match was played with a soccer ball.First college football game played at Rutgers in 1869 by Shaunna Stuck, The Pitt News, 20 Sep 2002 As a result, it is considered the first collegiate soccer match and the birth of soccer in the United States. Because gridiron football developed from the rules of association football and rugby football, many also consider the game played on November 6 to be the first gridiron game and the first collegiate football game. Rutgers won the game 6‚Äì4. Details and rules Part of the first season of college football, the game took place on November 6, 1869 at a field on College Avenue (now the site of the College Avenue Gymnasium) in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Because the game was played at Rutgers, it was also played under Rutgers' rules. They were based on the Football Association's rules of the time, in which two teams of 25 players attempted to score by kicking the ball into the opposing team's goal. The teams played 10 \\"games\\" against each other. When a team scored a goal, it counted as the end of that game, and the team with the most goals after 10 games was the winner. It is clear that this format did not resemble the game of college football as known today. The first such game in the United States in which the ball is advanced by physically picking it up and running, where play is stopped by knocking down the ball carrier, and each team fields eleven members was played on June 4, 1875 between Tufts and Harvard colleges. William J. Leggett, later a distinguished clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church, was the Rutgers captain; William Gummere, who later became chief justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, captained the New Jersey squad. The game was played in front of approximately 100 spectators. The players from Rutgers wore scarlet-colored turbans and handkerchiefs to distinguish themselves from the New Jersey players. The scarlet of the Rutgers Scarlet Knights came from this episode. Gameplay Painting by Rutgers graduate, William Boyd, depicting the game. See the goal posts and ball used, more in the style of association football rather than American football As the first of the 10 games began, two players from each of the teams positioned themselves near the opponent's goal. This was presumably because the participants were hoping to easily score when the ball reached their territory on the field of play. On each team, there were eleven so-called \\"fielders\\" who were assigned to defend their own territorial area. There were 12 participants on each team that they named \\"bulldogs\\" who were the ones playing in the other team's territory. Rutgers was the first to score a goal, as S. G. Gano and G. R. Dixon successfully kicked the ball across the New Jersey goal. At some point early in the contest, the \\"flying wedge\\" play was first used as the team with the ball formed a wall-like formation of players, allowing them to charge at the defenders. This flying wedge tactic was successful early on for Rutgers because of their size disadvantage over New Jersey. However, New Jersey countered the tactic when J.E. Michael, better known as \\"Big Mike\\", broke up the Rutgers' flying wedge during the fourth game. New Jersey took advantage and tied the score at 2‚Äì2. A Rutgers player named Madison M. Ball, a wounded veteran of the American Civil War, used his quickness and kicking the ball with the heel of his foot to again take the lead in the contest. Whenever the ball entered Rutgers territory, Ball would get in front of it and use a heel- kick to prevent New Jersey from scoring. Ball was able to successfully use that technique to set up Dixon to score another goal which gave Rutgers a 4‚Äì2 lead. Rutgers then allowed New Jersey to score a goal as one of their players, whose identity is not known, had kicked a ball towards their own goal. It was blocked by a Rutgers player, but New Jersey soon was able to take advantage to cut the lead down to 4‚Äì3. The Tigers scored on their next possession when they used a flying wedge play of their own led by Big Mike to march down the field to score to tie the game again at 4. Rutgers captain John W. Leggett had a strategy for his team at this point. He suggested that the Rutgers team keep the ball low on the ground to counter the much taller players on New Jersey team. This strategy appeared to work as Rutgers easily scored the final two goals of the contest to win the first intercollegiate football game played 6 games to 4. New Jersey had more size, which would normally be an advantage on a field with 50 total players, but the Tigers had trouble kicking the ball as a team which is something Rutgers did very well. In a 1933 account, a Rutgers player from the game named John W. Herbert said that he thought Rutgers was the smaller team, but that they had more speed than New Jersey. Aftermath The 1869 Rutgers football team, being honored on the field in 1918 In what might be considered a beginning to college football rivalries, immediately after Rutgers won this game, New Jersey's players were literally run out of town by the winning Rutgers students. The New Jersey students reportedly jumped in their carriages and quickly made the 20-mile trip back to their campus. In 1968, Arnold Friberg was commissioned by Chevrolet to create a painting commemorating the game. His work The First Game was one of four works that he created to celebrate 100 years of college football.

Boonzaier, was a South African cartoonist. He was famous for his caricatures of Cape politicians and celebrities at the turn of the century, and later for his anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist cartoons for Die Burger. He fathered the artist Gregoire Boonzaier. __TOC__ Early life Boonzaier was born on a Karoo farm in the country districts near Harmsfontein (later renamed Carnarvon), then part of the Cape Colony, in 1865. He received his first education at Carnarvon and joined the local magistrate's office as a clerk. In 1882, when he was 16 years old, Boonzaier moved to Cape Town to work in the office of the Master of the Cape Supreme Court, having been offered the job because of his impressive copperplate handwriting. He also worked in the Colonial Office and Orphan Chamber. Career Boonzaier had drawn amateur caricatures since 1884. He was inspired by the work of William Howard Schr√∂der, a cartoonist and publisher of the humorous weekly, The Knobkerrie, whom he later met when a work of his was accepted for publication. Boonzaier had no formal art tuition, but closely studied the work of George du Maurier and Phil May of Punch fame.Caricature of Louis Botha (Owlographs, 1901). In 1889 he resigned from his job in the civil service and became a professional cartoonist. Several newspapers, like Cape Punch, The Telephone and The Owl, began regularly publishing his work. In 1891 he started work on a gallery of South African and foreign notables and persuaded them to sign their caricatures; included are Paul Kruger, Piet Joubert, Ellen Terry, Sarah Bernhardt, Henrik Ibsen, Leo Tolstoy, √âmile Zola, Alphonse Daudet and Pierre Loti. Another collection, Owlographs, published in 1901, was dedicated to the members and visitors of the celebrated Owl Club, a society co-founded by Boonzaier in 1894 and \\"whose particular purpose was to entertain important visitors to the Cape\\". The collection is of great historical interest, as it depicts virtually all the main political actors of the time: Lord Milner, Cecil Rhodes, Gordon Sprigg, John X. Merriman, J. W. Sauer and W. P. Schreiner; Sirs John Henry de Villiers, Henry Juta and James Rose Innes; and Boer leaders like Paul Kruger, Marthinus Steyn, Louis Botha, Christiaan de Wet and F. W. Reitz. In 1903 Boonzaier was hired by The South Africa News, becoming South Africa's first full-time newspaper cartoonist. Boonzaier began working for Die Burger when it was founded in 1915 and continued to do so until 1940. The paper was the mouthpiece of J. B. M. Hertzog's newly formed National Party (NP) and was edited by D. F. Malan, then beginning his political career as NP leader in the Cape Province. Boonzaier's cartoons were powerful propaganda for the NP's resurgent Afrikaner nationalism, which opposed Louis Botha and Jan Smuts' relatively pro-Imperial and free-market South African Party. Though Botha had been a prominent bittereinder during the Boer War, as South Africa's first Prime Minister he was perceived as naively conciliatory and pro-Imperial, and became a regular target of Boonzaier's caricatures. But most influential were Boonzaier's anti-capitalist cartoons featuring the character Hoggenheimer, whom Boonzaier had borrowed from turn- of-the-century musical The Girl from Kays to evoke Randlords like Sir Ernest Oppenheimer. Though Boonzaier denied it, the character was widely assumed to be Jewish and came to be used to inflame anti-Semitism, most notoriously in the strident opposition to Jewish immigration in the 1930s. Certainly Boonzaier's cartoons expressed contempt for mining interests on the Rand, whose supposed exploitation of poor Afrikaners Smuts' government did little to prevent. These sentiments intensified when Smuts brutally suppressed the 1922 Rand Revolt, after which Hertzog swept to election victory over him and initiated a series of measures to protect white workers. Hertzog's later alliance with Smuts was vehemently opposed by Malan's Cape NP and Die Burger, and Hertzog soon came to be caricatured by Boonzaier as Hoggenheimer's stooge. Contribution to the arts Remarkably for a boy from the veld with very little schooling, Boonzaier's home was \\"a haven of culture in Cape Town\\". He was a lifelong enthusiast for theatre, both as an actor and producer, and kept a journal of his theatre-going which was later published and became important source material. He was probably the first owner of a gramophone in Cape Town, and collected books on the Impressionists and Hague School and colour reproductions of their work not otherwise available in South Africa. He maintained correspondence with Leo Tolstoy, Bernhardt, George Bernard Shaw, Henry Irving and Gilbert and Sullivan. Boonzaier was a major patron to painter Pieter Wenning; Moses Kottler was another prot√©g√©. Boonzaier's closest friends were Wenning, Kottler, Sangiro (A. A. Pienaar, one of the first writers of Afrikaans prose) and the Dutch-South African sculptor Anton van Wouw. His son Gregoire Boonzaier is considered a household name in Cape Impressionism and founded and organised the New Group. In popular culture James A. Michener's historical novel The Covenant refers to Boonzaier's Hoggenheimer cartoons and their contribution to populist fears.

From launch until June 1983, programming was based on BBC1 during the daytime, apart from coverage of major news events which saw the programmes shifted to BBC2. In September 1983 programming was transferred permanently to BBC2 freeing BBC1 to develop its own daytime schedule. The strand, named Daytime on Two, remained on BBC Two until March 2010, later supplemented by the 'Class TV' strand on the CBBC Channel. Origins The BBC began broadcasting schools programmes on BBC Television in the Autumn of 1957 in the afternoons. Morning transmissions began on 19 September 1960. Until 1972, schools programming along with adult education programmes were usually the only daytime programmes shown on both BBC and ITV, as the government regulated and restricted the amount of broadcasting hours the television channels could do each day. From the mid 1960s onwards a typical weekday on the BBC and ITV was limited to just 7 hours of normal programming during the day. Schools programmes were exempt from those restrictions, so the BBC and to a lesser degree ITV used the programming for schools to fill their daytime schedules. The restrictions were eased during 1971 and on 19 January 1972 the restrictions on broadcasting hours were lifted fully. ITV decided to move their schools programming to a new 2.5 hour block, airing from 9.30am-12.00pm each weekday, followed by their normal full daytime schedules after midday.https://www.transdiffusion.org/2016/01/27/why- is-tv-still-rationedhttps://www.transdiffusion.org/2015/01/19/not-open-all- hours Presentation =The Pie Chart= From September 1960 until September 1974, the presentation was a black and white card with a pie chart split into five segments with a BBC logo in the bottom right corner. The pie chart segments disappeared with the seconds and was operated via a mechanical model. They were introduced, from 1969, by a special version of the BBC1 mirror globe, but without the 'Colour' legend, as most schools programmes were still in black and white while the rest of BBC1's programmes were in colour. =The Diamond= In September 1974, the presentation was changed to a blue diamond on a black background with the BBC1 legend. It was commissioned to mark the start of schools programmes in colour, and consisted of the three diamonds of increasing size inside one another, first forming out of the background before pulsating and splitting into smaller diamonds, before eventually decreasing altogether. The colour scheme was changed following the BBC1 rebrand of image to orange on a navy blue background with, unusually, an orange legend. This was accompanied by an orange version of the BBC1 Network clock. A still version of the diamond was occasionally used on the channel, with a double lined version of the BBC1 logo. This was accompanied by a similar version for BBC2 with double lined BBC2 logo, for occasions when schools programmes were transferred to that channel. =The Dots= In September 1977, presentation was again changed to a countdown clock of disappearing dots around a spinning 'Schools and Colleges' legend. A white BBC1 legend was underneath, with the altered network clock discontinued. The spinning Schools and Colleges legend was in fact unintended and was a result of an issue with the mechanical model used. This was amended by the following summer. In autumn 1981, the new corporate double lined BBC1 logo was added to the model in replacement of the old one, however this amended model only lasted three months, as the whole mechanical model was replaced by a computer generated version. The primary difference was that the dots, instead of fading to the background colour of blue, faded to black. Upon occasions when the schools strand was transferred to BBC2, a version with the BBC2 double lined logo was used the 2 legend replacing the BBC1 legend. Following the switch to electronic, the BBC2 version was also recreated, however during the Falklands War, a version with a hastily added BBC2 ident was used, with the replaced caption being the orange logo on a black background box.Schools page at TVARK containing a video of Falklands War BBC2 legend At around this time, special holding captions with the phrase 'Follows Shortly' were beginning to be used for junctions longer than the 60 seconds that the ident required. During a junction, the follows shortly caption would be shown over music before the screen faded into the ident. Library music was mostly used but chart music was used on occasions including Night Fever, Summer Nights, (Remember the Days of the) Old Schoolyard, and I'm A Believer. =Daytime on 2= In September 1983, Schools programmes were moved from BBC1 to BBC2. This gave BBC1 the space to broadcast a daytime schedule although it was another three years until BBC1 launched a full daytime service. A special strand was set up on BBC2: Daytime on 2 as programmes were broadcast all day (from just after 9am until 3pm during the autumn and spring terms - fewer programmes were shown during the summer term) as opposed to just during the morning and early afternoon as had been the case on BBC1. The lunchtime period was occupied by adult education programmes which had previously been broadcast on BBC2 on Mondays and Tuesdays. The adult education programmes were only broadcast during the autumn and spring terms so Pages from Ceefax and sometimes Open University programmes were shown at lunchtimes during the summer term. A special version of the striped 2 ident was created, featuring an orange background instead of the usual black. Clocks were not used alongside the look but the 'Follows Shortly' captions were retained. For the first two years of Daytime on Two, special Ceefax pages were broadcast during the longer intervals. The pages, branded as The Daytime on 2 Information Service, featured schedules and information about Daytime on 2 output.Broadcast of the Daytime On 2 Information Service The pages were discontinued at the end of the 1984/85 school year. In March 1986, BBC2 rebranded to the white embossed TWO on a white background. From here on, no special ident was used to introduce Daytime on Two programmes, instead using the normal ident as by now the special Daytime on 2 Ceefax pages had been discontinued. All gaps of less than fifteen minutes were now filled using the newly designed 'Follows Shortly' captions over music, before cutting to the ident and announcement. A later addition was that of a 15-second countdown timer, displaying the seconds in a box, usually located in the top right corner of the screen. However, there are examples of the location being changed depending on the programme caption that preceded the ident.Videos of different places for the 15 second countdown clock at TVARK =1991 onwards= Following the rebrand of TWO to BBC2, including the introduction of the '2' idents, no special strand was set out to mark schools programmes. The 'Follows Shortly' captions were phased out in place of promotions of other appropriate programmes, through static programme captions and fillers that may be considered similar to the intervals on the BBC Television Service in the 50s and 60s. Between 19 January 1993 ‚Äì 5 October 1995, some programmes were shown (as subject blocks or a series block) overnight as part of a new experiment called Night School. This moved to the overnight service The Learning Zone in October 1995, Airings of Nightschool from 1993-1995 which later rebranded as BBC Learning Zone in October 1997. On 9 October 1995, following the launch of the BBC Learning Zone, some programming, generally the secondary education programming, was transferred to the new overnight service, as more schools were showing recordings of the programmes rather than the programmes live. It was announced in 2009 that school programming would be moved to the BBC Learning Zone. Primary school programming left the daytime schedules on 26 March 2010. When the CBBC Channel launched in February 2002, their remit resulted in their need to show schools programming. This resulted in the Class TV strand, shown during schools hours for a few hours (usually repeats of previous programmes, rather than new ones). In March 2008, the CBBC remit was altered to remove the schools element from the channel. All schools programmes were then shown overnight on the BBC Learning Zone, until the strand ended on 24 July 2015 due to budget cuts. This meant that BBC Schools output was now online-only.

China also makes 99% of the world's electric buses.  History  China's first subway was constructed in Beijing in the late 1960s, nearly one hundred years after its initial development in London. By 1984, 66 major subway systems existed worldwide. Urban rail transit helped ease the immense pressure caused by urban traffic congestion, while allowing commuters to travel at great speed and convenience. Tianjin was the second city to have an urban rapid transit system and Shanghai was the third, the latter opening its Metro in 1995 that incorporated both subway and light railway lines.  Electric bike and motorcycle development in the 90s  The two principal types of two-wheeled vehicles in China: two-wheel bicycles propelled by human pedaling supplemented by electrical power from a storage battery (bicycle-style), and low-speed scooters propelled almost solely by electricity (scooter style). The technology of both types is similar. China's two-wheeled electric vehicle industry started under the planned economy of the Maoist 1960s. However, early efforts to develop and commercialize these electric vehicles failed. A group of entrepreneurs gathered during the 1980s to revive the fledgling industry but their ambitions were thwarted by poor technology and limited government support. By the 1990s, China witnessed the world's most spectacular growth in two-wheeled electric vehicles and annual sales of bicycles and scooters grew from fifty six thousand in 1998 to over twenty one million in 2008.Comparison of common urban travel modes in China (Weinert et al. 2006) In 2008 only, Chinese bought 21 million electric-bikes, compared with 9.4 million autos.J. Weinert, C. Ma, C. Cherry, The transition to electric bikes in China: history and key reasons for rapid growth, Transportation 34 (3) (2007) 301‚Äì318/ This growth of electric-bicycles in China was less technology-driven and more policy-driven, facilitated by favorable local regulatory practices in the form of gasoline powered motorcycle bans and loose enforcement of electric bicycle standards. The alleged justifications for these bans included relieving traffic congestion, improving safety and reducing air pollution. Many Chinese cities started to ban or restrict motorcycles and scooters using a variety of measures: some cities suspended the issuance of new motorcycle licenses, others banned the entrance of motorcycles and scooters into certain downtown regions or major roads, and some capped the number of licenses and then auctioned the license plates that were available. These bans were imposed on all motorcycles, regardless of their power sources, and since electric-bikes are categorized as non-motor vehicles they were exempt from the bans. According to the motorcycle committee of the Society of Automotive Engineers of China, the use of motorcycles is now banned or restricted in over ninety major Chinese cities. In fact, the government further supported the use of electric-bicycles by including them as one of 10 key scientific-development priority projects in the country's ninth Five-Year Plan. Some insiders claim that their development had the personal endorsement of former Premier Li Peng. In addition, improved technology, low barriers to entry, decreasing purchase price, and urban living were factors that furthered the popularity of electric-bicycles as a transportation mode. First, bicycle technology - specifically for motors and batteries - improved significantly during the late 1990s and this, coupled with a vast supplier base and weak intellectual property protection, increased competition. An increase in competition drove down the price of electric-bicycles and at the same time, a rise in gasoline prices made them more competitive economically with alternatives like gasoline-powered scooters or cars. An increased influx of workers to urban areas further increased demand for an affordable, motorized, and convenient form of private mobility since traveling by bicycle or bus in congested areas or across long distances was no longer viable. Recently, restrictions on electric-bicycles in China have been gradually spreading and there is a growing concern amongst consumers that the government may impose an outright ban. Nevertheless, since they are an important mode of electric transportation, the experience found with electric-bicycles offers important lessons for the launch of other types of electric vehicles.  Electric car development after 2000  = Political background and government support = According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, China surpassed the United States to become the world's largest automobile market in 2009 with a record 13.9 million vehicles sold in the country, compared to 10.43 million cars and light trucks sold in the United States. There is a quickly growing demand for transport in China as more people can afford to buy cars. To support its commitment to encourage electric-vehicle development the government will provide US$15 billion to the industry.\\"Freidman OpEd: China's 'Moon Shot' Versus America's\\" http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=24054 \\" Their intention, in addition to creating a world-leading industry that will produce jobs and exports, is to reduce urban pollution and decrease its dependence on oil. As such, government's goal is to have five million battery-electric and plug-in hybrid electric cars on the road by 2020, while also producing one million such vehicles annually by 2020. The government has established a policy framework to accelerate electric-vehicle technology development, while encouraging market transformation that will support research and development, regulate the industry and encourage consumption. The milestones in government support for the electric-vehicle industry are numerous: ;2001 ‚Ä¢ China starts the \\"863 EV Project\\" (pure EV, hybrid EV, and fuel cell vehicles are included) ;2004 ‚Ä¢ National Development and Reform Commission publishes Auto Industry Development Policy ‚Ä¢ Sixteen Chinese state-owned companies formed an electric vehicle industry association in Beijing called www.ceva.org.cn/EN. The goal of the association is to integrate technological standards and create a mechanism through which stakeholders share information in order to develop a top of the market e-vehicle. The companies are anticipated to invest a total of US$14.7 billion on the growing electric vehicles market by 2012. ;2007 ‚Ä¢ China invests over RMB2 billion (US$300 million) in new energy vehicle development. ;2008 ‚Ä¢ Sales volume of Chinese new energy vehicles surges to 366 units in the first half of 2008, reaching a year-on-year increase of 107.9%. Chinese automakers provide around 500 independently developed new energy and fuel efficiency vehicles to serve Beijing Olympics. ‚Ä¢ 13 cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Changchun, Dalian, Hangzhou, Jinan, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Hefei, Changsha, Kunming, and Nanchang) are chosen as pilot cities for new EV usage in 2009. ;2009 ‚Ä¢ The State Council approves the Auto Industry Restructuring and Revitalization Plan to invest RMB10 billion (US$1.50 billion) for new e-vehicle industrialization. ‚Ä¢ The State Council invests RMB20 billion (US$3 billion) in technique development. ‚Ä¢ To improve air quality and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, the government announces a two-year pilot program of subsidizing buyers of alternative energy cars in five cities (Shanghai, Changchun, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Hefei). The subsidy for EV customers is RMB60,000 for battery electric vehicles (BEV) and RMB50,000 for plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV).Liza, Lin. \\"China to Subsidize Alternative Energy Car Purchases\\", Bloomberg, China, 6 January 2010. ;2010 ‚Ä¢ An auto industry (including new energy) development plan for 2011 to 2020 was drafted to include a plan to transform the domestic auto industry. Approval has been delayed. ‚Ä¢ China plans to expand a project of encouraging the use of energy-efficient and alternative-energy vehicles in public transport to 20 cities from 13. EV). ;2011 ‚Ä¢ There are several major electric vehicle R&D; and manufacturer company in Chinese market. The company including: SAIC, FAW, Dongfeng, Chana, BAIC, GAC, Chery, BYD and Geely. Additionally, there are several R&D; institutes has been built up such as Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Technology, and Tongji University. They all have their own centers focusing NEV research. 2018 China manufactured and sold about 1.2 million plug-in electric vehicles in 2018, which was more than three times the sales in the US. China has become the fastest and largest growing market for electric vehicles in the world. New electric cars (EV) had a market share of 4.2% of new cars sold in China for the entire year of 2018. Big cities like Shenzhen and Beijing are rapidly adopting electric vehicles -- for example, all of Shenzhen's 16,000 public buses are now electric, and soon all of its 22,000 taxis will be electric cars as well. = Environment concerns and Chinese oil demand = Developing electric-vehicles will assist energy conservation and security in China since energy efficiency is 46% higher than that of internal combustion engines (ICEs). Electric-vehicles also have the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 13-68%: directly, through advanced V2G (vehicle-to-grid) technology and indirectly, through peak shaving. Developing electric-vehicles will also reduce China's reliance on oil imports. China became a net oil importer in 1993, the world's second-largest petroleum consumer after the United States in 2004, and imported 52% of its oil by 2009. The International Energy Agency projects that Chinese oil consumption will more than double from in 2008 to by 2030. At the same time, it became the largest automobile market in the world by the end of 2009 and McKinsey estimates that China's vehicle fleet will increase tenfold between 2005 and 2030. As the demand for cars continues to grow in China, the associated demand for gasoline will put continual pressure on China's energy security. China is building its own Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) that can hold , about enough to supply its oil needs for 20 days, and also plans to build eight additional coastal oil reserves by 2011 to increase its total emergency supply to . At the same time, China is encouraging and supporting the development of alternative energy options, especially in terms of electric-vehicle development, because they anticipate the rise of new fuel technologies and greater fuel efficiency will give them greater energy independence. According to Wan Gang, Minister of Science and Technology, \\"green vehicles are key for the development of China's auto industry as auto exhaust emissions already account for 70% of the country's air pollution in major Chinese cities.\\"  Value chain  The Chinese government has developed a plan to make China one of the leading producers of electric and hybrid vehicles by 2012. The goal meets two basic needs: to improve the environment and save energy at home, and to transform Chinese automakers into major players in the global automobile industry. Although China already has one of the largest automotive industries in the world, one of its biggest shortcomings is its outdated gasoline engine technology. Transitioning to large-scale electric-vehicle activity could give China a competitive advantage over the West. Capitalizing on the low barriers to entry in the industry, stakeholders are establishing credibility in the manufacturing of electric- vehicles. However, there has also been a recent push in China to complement manufacturing with defined segments across the value chain including energy storage, energy infrastructure, distribution, and value added services. = Energy storage = E-vehicles use only electric motors and gearboxes, and have few parts requiring maintenance. Compared to traditional vehicles and excluding the battery, they are cheaper easier to build.(Reference: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123172034731572313) 2009 paywall However, building battery with sufficient capacity and discharge-cycles is a challenge. BYD Company is a Chinese company that builds rechargeable batteries using a new technology that, according to the company, makes them safer than other lithium-ion models. In 2005, it became the world's leading small battery company and is one of the world's largest manufacturers of rechargeable batteries. It is emerging as a leader in the technology sector. Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint-Stock Co. Ltd. is another China based battery manufacturer. The company has a partnership with Coda Automotive, a California based company, to develop a Coda electric vehicle and ultimately, batteries for use in electricity generation. The focus of the latter will be to provide energy storage for wind and solar energy generation. In 2017, the government battery subsidies fell by 30% and Chinese EV sales dropped. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bF6TqCF7OA&sns;=fb = Energy infrastructure = While the shape of this industry is still emerging, electricity generation and the infrastructure to deliver energy appear to be the areas with the highest potential and relevancy to manage future energy use. According to consulting group Oliver Wyman, \\"some utilities are already engaging a specific area of the value chain, setting priorities for near-term, medium-term, and long-term initiatives. They have begun to model different market and business impact scenarios, with the goal of identifying the biggest upsides and pitfalls.\\" Utilities have begun to develop focused strategies in areas where they are well positioned to serve the electric-vehicle value chain. At the moment, a variety of business design ideas are competing to shape the new marketplace. China has invested a great deal into this fundamental component of the value chain, and some of the principal facilitators are as follows: * State Grid Corporation of China * Jiangxi Ganneng. Co An electricity provider, year-end 2009, the Company finished approximately six billion kilowatt-hours of on-grid electricity, and had an attributable installed capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts, including 1.4 million kilowatts of thermal power and 100,000 kilowatts of hydropower. * Nari Technology Development The Company develops, manufactures and sells software and hardware products serving the power industry, and also provide system integration services. It also provides software and hardware services and system integration services for things such as power grid dispatching automation products, electricity market commercial operating systems, and electrical control automation products. *XJ Electric Co. This Company is primarily engaged in research, development, manufacture and distribution of automation, protection and controlling products for electric power systems. Specifically, it provides power grid and power generation equipment, transformers, electrical systems, power distribution network products, electrified railway products and direct current (DC) power distribution systems. = Multibrand and multimaker distribution and value added services= China is implementing policies that advocate diversified energy sources for use across industries. In a parallel effort, private companies are introducing innovative ways that support the use of clean energy. To bridge the gap between the customers and suppliers, Shanghai based company TZGEV has introduced distribution and value added services that integrate and streamline resources from electric-vehicle carmakers and related equipment suppliers in the private and public sectors. Recognizing a need for activity across the electric-vehicle value chain, they are offering EV's for sale and for rent, technical repair and maintenance, and value added services inclusive of fleet management.  Challenges to the industry  The Climate Group has published an extensive report regarding the challenges that can be summarized into four factors: How can the bottlenecks in technology and industrialization be addressed? Can China catch up to the West in design, research and development, manufacturing of key components and the vehicle assembly? Can China create a large-scale infrastructure to support the industry? And can China reduce the price so that e-vehicles are competitive and accessible? One challenge is the decreasing prices of competing fuel. Crude oil prices are currently softening and may soften further in future.

Personal life Musgrave was born in London to Thomas and Elizabeth Musgrave (n√©e Hide) on 28 December 1774. His mother died two years later, and his father's will made him his chief beneficiary upon his death when Musgrave was fourteen. He lived abroad for some time, and became fluent in German and Portuguese. In 1802, he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Home Secretary, Lord Pelham. In 1804, he took the post of Secretary and Confidential Superintendent of the Aliens Office. Lord Minto gave him the position of Secretary to the Government of Ireland, in which he served one term, afterwards returning to the Aliens Office post, which Earl Spencer had kept open for him. He was released from this post in 1816 as part of a government shake-up, and was endowed with a pension. Lord Pelham, who was now Postmaster General, appointed Musgrave to become the Mail Agent for Lisbon, in which post he was able to communicate valuable political information back to England during the Peninsular War. In 1821, Francis Freeling, Secretary of the Post Office, appointed him as Postmaster and Mail Agent for Falmouth, which was a leading hub of the Post Office Packet Service. This was handed over to the Admiralty in 1824, with Musgrave managing the transfer, whereupon his post as Postmaster was passed to William Gay, who served until 1843. Musgrave was then Comptroller of the London Twopenny Post until 1833, when it was taken over by the General Post Office. He was then offered the post of Postmaster General of Jamaica, which he declined, fearing for his health in Jamaica's hot climate. He was Postmaster of Bath from 1833 until his death in 1854. In this role, he was influential in the introduction of the Penny Black, the first postage stamp, and Mulready stationery. The first posting of a stamp in the world was from Bath post office on 2 May, four days prior to the official issue date. Only three blue (twopenny) Mulready envelopes marked 6 May 1840 are known to exist, one of which was from Musgrave and addressed to Isabella Tudor of Bath, and now resides in the Bath Postal Museum, which also has an exhibition about Musgrave. Musgrave died on 4 September. He left behind one daughter, Ann, aged 32 at the time of his death, to whom he left everything in his will. Ann married her father's Chief Clerk, Jabez Rich, who later became Postmaster of Liverpool. Writings As an author, Musgrave published several books and pamphlets, such as Considerations on the re-establishment of an effective Balance of Power (1813). As a translator, he is best known for his translation of the Portuguese epic poem Os Lus√≠adas (The Lusiads) into English blank verse, which was published in 1826 by John Murray.

This makes it possible to rewind the information to \\"as it actually was\\" in combination with \\"as it was recorded\\" at some point in time. In order to be able to do so, information cannot be discarded even if it is erroneous. Within, for example, financial reporting it is often desirable to be able to recreate an old report both as it actually looked at the time of creation and as it should have looked given corrections made to the data after its creation. Implementations of Bitemporal Modeling are mostly done using relational databases. As such, Bitemporal Modeling is considered different from Dimensional Modeling and complementary to database normalization. The SQL:2011 standard provides language constructs for working with bitemporal data. However, many of current solutions are still vendor-specific.  Philosophy  Bitemporal modeling uses bitemporal structures as the basic components. This results in the databases which have a consistent type of temporality for all data.  Benefits of Bitemporal Modeling  By focusing on completeness and accuracy of data, Bitemporal Modeling facilitates the creation of complete audit trails of data. All data becomes immutable. Specifically this allows for queries which provide: # The most accurate data possible as we know it now # Data as we knew it at any point in time # When and why the most accurate data we had changed Implementations in notable products * MarkLogic introduced bitemporal data support in version 8.0.

The one example built was flown across the country to every EAA chapter at the time. Design and development The first drawings of the Pober Sport were published in the November 1956 issue of the experimenter. The Pober Sport is a strut-braced, low-wing, taildragger aircraft. The fuselage is a modification of the Ace Baby Ace. The landing gear is from a J-3 Cub. The fabric covered aluminium wings are from a high-wing Luscombe Aircraft design. The elevators are controlled with push-pull tubes. Operational history The Pober Sport was introduced at the 1959 EAA convention. During the sourcing of the parts, Poberezny used a C-47 to pick up the Luscome wings, and started work on the ailerons while in- flight. Anders ‚ÄúAndy‚Äù Ljungberg later toured the United States on a 72 stop tour with the aircraft to visit every EAA chapter in the country.

Youth  A member of the House of Kotromaniƒá, Stephen was the only legitimate son of King Ostoja, born by his second wife, Kujava Radinoviƒá. His parents married in 1399, while Stephen first appears in historical records in late 1408 as endorser of his father's donation to the noble brothers Vukiƒá and Juraj Radivojeviƒá for their loyal service. Along with his mother, Stephen next endorsed his father's charter of privileges to the Republic of Ragusa in 1409. King Ostoja repudiated Queen Kujava in 1416, and it appears that Stephen left him too; the 16th-century Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini claimed that Stephen was mentioned as Ostoja's opponent in 1417. Ostoja remarried immediately, taking the wealthy widow Jelena Nelipiƒá as his third wife. By 22 July 1417, Stephen reconciled with his father and, with his stepmother, endorsed another Ostoja's donation to the Radivojeviƒá brothers, who had helped suppress a rebellion by Zachlumians. Stephen was given authority over them.  Reign  King Ostoja died in 1418 and the stanak was convoked to recognize Stephen as the new king. He immediately restored his mother's royal honours and had his stepmother imprisoned. Stephen's first act as king was to notify Ragusa of his election and claim tributes now due to him. An Ottoman raid enabled the Ragusans to stall the payement. Stephen took into his service Miho Kaboga (of the Ragusan Kaboga family), a former protovestijar of Grand Duke Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá, and soon fell under his influence, which the nobility resented. Kaboga urged him to conquer the Ragusan city of Ston, claiming it was not strongly fortified and that the peninsula of Pelje≈°ac was not protected. Stephen claimed the Hrvatiniƒá house in Ragusa, as well as the coast surrounding Slano and all the \\"royal goods\\", but eventually relented. After a council with his mother and the nobility in the town of Zveƒçaj in March 1419, Stephen confirmed the privileges granted to Ragusa by his predecessors. The same year he confirmed the sale of Konavli and the Sokol Fortress of his vassal Sandalj Hraniƒá Kosaƒça to Ragusa. In September 1419, Stephen offered an alliance to the Republic of Venice in all their wars, and then enjoyed their war for Albania against Bal≈°a III. The conflict strained his relations with his vassal Kosaƒça, Bal≈°a's stepfather and protector, but the two did not engage directly. When the Ottoman army led by Ishak Bey launched a raid against Bosnia, specifically targeting the domains of Stephen and his maternal relatives and supporters, the Pavloviƒá noble family, Kosaƒça took the opportunity to turn against Stephen and declare his support for the former king Tvrtko II, his cousin and father's long-time rival supported by the Ottomans. Other magnates followed him. Stephen had been formally deposed by August 1420. The last extant document mentioning him dates from April 1421, when he offered a renewal of alliance to Venice.

The Fable There is a short Greek version of the fable and a longer, more circumstantial late Latin poem by Avianus. It concerns two pots, one of earthenware and the other of metal, that are being swept along a river. While the metal pot is willing that they should journey together, the clay pot hopes it will keep its distance for ‚ÄòWhether the wave crashes me into you or you into me, in either case I will be the only victim‚Äô. The moral drawn is that equal partnership is best, and especially that the poor or powerless should avoid the company of the powerful. In this connection, there is a likeness between the story and a passage in the debated book of Ecclesiasticus that advises caution in such unequal relationships: 'Have no fellowship with one that is richer than thyself. What agreement shall the earthen pot have with the kettle? For if they knock one against the other, it shall be broken' (13.2-3). Since this particular scripture is in Greek and dates from the 2nd century BCE, it is possible that the passage quoted and the fable are both based on a popular proverb. But there is also a connection with a later Talmudic proverb which underlines the no-win situation of the fable: 'If a pot falls upon a stone, woe to the pot; if a stone falls upon a pot, woe to the pot; either way, woe to the pot' (Esther Rabbah, 7:10). A Japanese print of Aesop's fable by Kawanabe Kyosai dating from 1870-80 Yet another oriental connection with this proverbial lore occurs in the Indian Panchatantra. In its second section, which deals with the gaining of friends, there is a long debate between Hiranyaka the rat and Laghupatanaka the crow about partnership between such natural enemies as themselves. One of the points made is that 'Friendship with bad men is like a pot of clay, easy to break but difficult to rejoin. With good men it is like a pot of gold, difficult to break but easy to mend.'Panchatantra, reconstructed by Franklin Edgerton, London 1965, p.83 Here once again we find earthenware and metal pots contrasted. The connection with the passage in Ecclesiasticus was noted by Andrea Alciato in the various editions of his Emblemata. The aim of his collection was to point a moral lesson through an iconic illustration, supported by Latin verses (and translations into other languages) and a commentary. The fable of the two pots was chosen to illustrate the Latin proverb Aliquid mali propter vicinum malum (Bad comes of a bad neighbour), which Erasmus had included in his Adagia (Adage 32).View online The English poet Geoffrey Whitney followed Alciato in all this, using an illustration from one of his editions in his Choice of Emblemes (1568), but supporting it with an 18-line poem of his own.Page 164, view online The final stanza sums up the meaning of the fable: :The running streame, this worldlie sea dothe shewe; :The pottes present the mightie, and the pore: :Whoe here, a time are toss√©d too and froe, :But if the meane dwell nighe the mighties dore, ::He maie be hurte, but cannot hurte againe, ::Then like, to like: or beste alone remaine. While the title of Aesop's fable is almost always given as \\"The Two Pots\\", La Fontaine's Fables contrast their different constituents in a rather different fable based on it, Le pot de terre et le pot de fer (Fables V.2).An English version is online In this the iron pot proposes a journey together to the clay pot, which is only persuaded by the stronger pot's offer to protect him. When they are jostled together on their way, the clay pot is shattered and only has himself to blame. 'Only equals should associate' is the conclusion. A French proverb derives from this fable, where the phrase 'It's the iron pot against the clay pot' (C'est le pot de fer contre le pot de terre) is used in cases when the weak come off worst. In 1713 Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, was to use La Fontaine's version of the story in her lively recreation, \\"The Brass-Pot and Stone- Jugg\\".Miscellany poems, on several occasions, pp.55-8 Artistic interpretations Book illustrations of Aesop's fable inevitably picture two contrasting pots being carried along a river. In the lively woodblock print by the Japanese artist Kawanabe Kyosai, the pots are given human forms and shown tossed on the waves of a heavy sea. There the earthen pot is desperately fending off the friendly approach of the metal pot. In the distance is a town with mountains behind it. How much Kyosai has added is plain when one compares his version with the one by John Tenniel on which it is based. The gated town in the background is almost identical, but Tenniel shows the two pots becalmed in an eddy near the mouth of an estuary.Thomas James, Aesop's Fables, a new version, London 1874, p.75 This in turn looks back to the various illustrations in Alciato's Book of Emblems, especially that of the 1591 edition. There the pots are tossed on waves as they are carried towards the sea; in the background are mountains with a town at their foot and a castle perched on a height.Available on Flickr Two French composers have set La Fontaine's fable.

It is owned by Waste Management, Inc. The landfill dates to 1965, when it started as a ten-foot high pile of debris in what was then a remote section of the county. It currently takes in an average of 3,500 tons of trash daily and has the capacity to accept 10,000 tons of trash daily. The site has long emitted foul odors into the air of neighboring Coconut Creek. Complaints from the city in the 1990s resulted in Waste Management being fined for violating air standards. The company attempted to alleviate the problem by covering the garbage with extra dirt and spraying deodorizer from 55-gallon drums. In 2008, Waste Management withdrew its application to increase the height of the landfill from 225 feet to 280 feet. In 2011, Waste Management renamed the site the \\"Monarch Hill Renewable Energy Park.\\" In 2010, after Coconut Creek threatened a lawsuit, Waste Management agreed that particularly odorous trash, such as food and other materials that decay, would no longer go into the landfill after three years. After Waste Management received a series of warnings from Broward County in 2012, it also agreed to place a cap over 10 acres of the landfill, spread 18 inches of soil over trash instead of the required 6 inches, employ greater use of odor-neutralizing chemicals, and pay over $100,000 in fines and costs. Nevertheless, by 2013, Waste Management had accumulated $1.6 million in fines, and Coconut Creek was still plagued by foul odors from Mount Trashmore.

In the Middle Ages, Ktenia often changed hands between Bulgaria and Byzantium. The ruins of the fortress lie northeast of the town of Sungurlare, in the Grebenets section of the Eastern Balkan Mountains. In ancient and medieval times, it served as an important defensive position guarding the Karnobat Pass through the mountains. Neighbouring castles included Rusokastro to the southeast and Aytos to the east. It is uncertain whether Ktenia is identical with the castle named Goloe, which lay in the same region, or whether these were separate fortifications. In 705, Ktenia became part of the First Bulgarian Empire when the Zagore area was ceded to Tervel by the Byzantine Empire. When the Bulgarian Empire was reestablished at the end of the 12th century, Ktenia was once again under Bulgarian control until it was conquered by the Byzantines during the Uprising of Ivaylo (1277‚Äì1280). The fortress was recovered by Bulgaria after a successful war by emperor Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300‚Äì1321) in 1304.

He was recognized as king by the Ottoman Empire and the Despotate of Serbia, as well as by the Bosnian noble houses of Kosaƒça and Pavloviƒá, but never by the West. Radivoj is thus seldom included in the list of rulers of Bosnia.  Background  Radivoj was the older of the two illegitimate sons of King Ostoja. He was most likely born before 1410, during Ostoja's marriage to Kujava Radinoviƒá, the mother of the King's only legitimate son, Stephen Ostojiƒá. Like his younger brother Thomas, Radivoj was a doubly adulterine child, as his father confessed to the pope that their mother too had a living husband at the time of their births. The surname Kristiƒá (or Krstiƒá or Hrstiƒá), which was often appended to his name, was most likely derived from his mother's family name. Upon Ostoja's death in September 1418, Radivoj's older half-brother Stephen ascended the throne, but was deposed by their father's nephew and rival Tvrtko II in 1421, dying soon afterwards.  Anti-king  Radivoj started claiming the crown in 1428, but did not become a serious pretender until the War for Konavli in 1430, when the Ottomans lent him their support. Acting as anti-king, Radivoj sent a delegation to the Republic of Ragusa in 1431. The following year, the Burgundian spy Bertrandon de la Broqui√®re found him at the Sublime Porte asking Murad II for help in his bid to the throne. The Despot of Serbia ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and Bosnia's most powerful noblemen, Sandalj of the House of Kosaƒça and Radoslav of the House of Pavloviƒá, also rallied to support Radivoj. By 1433, Radivoj controlled most of the kingdom, with Tvrtko being reduced to its central and northwestern parts. ƒêuraƒë and the noblemen eventually lost interest in Radivoj, but the Ottomans persisted and took possession of Bobovac in his name in 1434. The Hungarians restored Jajce, Hodidjed, Boƒçac and the Komotin Castle to Tvrtko in mid-1434, but lost it all again to Radivoj as soon as they retreated, and appears to have followed them out of Bosnia. This made Radivoj the de facto King of Bosnia, but he was not recognized as legitimate monarch by any Christian state. Radivoj's fortunes overturned, however, when the Ottomans ceased supporting him in 1435, and he fled to the Kosaƒça court in Zachlumia in the spring of 1435. Tvrtko seized the opportunity and, again with Hungarian help, reestablished himself in the kingdom. Radivoj continued styling himself king of Bosnia for the remainder of Tvrtko II's reign, but without any recognition. The death of the childless Tvrtko II in November 1443 opened a new possibility for Radivoj, who was at that time residing at the court of Sandalj's nephew and successor, Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça. Tvrtko, however, had specifically intended to exclude Radivoj from succession, and appears to have designated Radivoj's younger brother Thomas as his heir. Thomas was elected king by a majority of the nobility despite Radivoj's attempts in Ragusa to prevent his brother's recognition as heir. A pro-Ottoman faction led by Stjepan, who did not take part in the election, declared for Radivoj. A war was waged until 1446, and it ended with Thomas being acknowledged as king by all the noblemen and by Radivoj himself. Radivoj was granted appanage by his brother, including the fortresses of Vranduk near Doboj, Sokol near Graƒçanica and Komotin near Jajce.  King's brother  In June 1449, Radivoj married Catherine, the second of the three daughters of the Hungarian nobleman Nicholas of Velika, who had no sons. An inheritance pact was signed between the men on 19 June, establishing that the marriage would be contracted according to Roman Catholic rite and that the couple would inherit a third of Nicholas' Slavonian and Hungarian possessions after he and his wife Margaret die. Radivoj, in turn, gave half of his estates in Bosnia and Slavonia to his parents-in-law. Catherine and Radivoj had three sons; Tvrtko and George, who are mentioned in 1455, and Matthias, probably the youngest. Smederevo Fortress Radivoj spent the remainder of Thomas' reign peacefully and aiding his brother when necessary. In 1458, he took part in the negotiations with the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus and the Serbian despoina Helena Palaiologina regarding the marriage of his nephew Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá and Helena's daughter Helena. King Thomas' sent Radivoj to Hungary as an envoy in October. In January the following year, Radivoj accompanied his nephew to the session of the Diet of Hungary in Buda, and two months later to Smederevo, where Stephen married Helena and became the new despot. In June, however, the Ottomans army attacked Serbia and approached the Smederevo Fortress. No attempt to defend it was made, and Radivoj negotiated surrender and safe conduct of the royal family. The King of Hungary accused Radivoj and Thomas of betrayal and selling the fortress to the Ottomans, \\"damaging the Christendom\\", and confiscated the estates Radivoj held in his kingdoms. Matthias circulated the allegation throughout Europe, while Thomas made great effort to deny it. He sent emissaries to Mantua, where they were received by Pope Pius II on 10 July before Matthias's accusation reached him. Radivoj was probably one of the envoys, as the Pope took the opportunity to address a request he made regarding private worship.  Last years  The death of King Thomas in July 1461 was shrouded in rumours of foul play by his brother and son, likely unsubstantiated and fabricated. Radivoj's relationship with his nephew, the new king, was cordial. A charter of questionable authencity, in Bosnian language, was allegedly issued by Stephen on 18 September, confirming all of Radivoj's fortresses and other holdings in the kingdom for his \\"faithful and true services to the crown\\". Stephen's reign was brief; he tactlessly provoked an Ottoman attack which put an end to Bosnia's independence in May 1463. Radivoj accompanied him in his attempt to escape to Croatia, but they were captured by Mehmed the Conqueror's army in Kljuƒç, shortly after Ragusan authorities decided to send him gunpowder. Radivoj was executed on spot or along with Stephen at Mehmed's camp near Jajce shortly afterwards. Radivoj's 13-year-old son Tvrtko was executed alongside him. His widow escaped to Dalmatia and remarried, while his son Matthias was for a while a puppet king installed by the Ottomans.

In 1618/1619 - five generations later - Holger Rosenkrantz (died 1638) sold Boller to Ellen Marsvin (1572- 1649), the widow of Ludvig Munk, who in 1607 married secondly Knud Rud, and whose daughter Kirsten Munk had in 1615 married King CHRISTIAN IV (1577-1648).

The so-called \\"Legitimised Line\\" is an unnecessary creation, suggesting that it was illegitimate before; it was begun by the Boller-descendant Holger Rosenkrantz (1599-1634 Venlo), who was a soldier in Danish and Dutch service and apparently had been abroad for so long that no one remembered him so that his sons Ludvig (fief baron of Rosendal in 1678) and Maximilian (at Nyboellegaard) had to prove that Holger's father was Frederick Rosenkrantz (1571-1602 Moravia!) of the Boller line. =Line III: Arreskov= The Arreskov line descends from the Boller line Faaborg on Funen, when in 1558 Erik Rosnkrantz (1520 - 1575) married the heiress of Arreskov: Helvig Jacobsdatter Hardenberg (1540 - 1599). =Line IV: Rosenholm= The Rosenholm line also descends from the Boller line and consists of descendants of J√∏rgen Ottesen Rosenkrantz at Rosenholm (1523 - 1596). This line became extinct in the paternal line in 1802 with the death of Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz (1724-1802). =Line V: Villestrup (baronial)= The baronial line of Villestrup, a side line of line IV. This line descends from Baron Werner Rosenkrantz til Villestrup (1700‚Äì1777), who in 1757 received the royal patent for this fief barony. The family seat Rosenholm was inherited by this line in 1802, and all present Danish members of the Rosenkrantz family, belong to this line. =Line VI: Brusgaard / Barritskov= The Brusgaard /Barritskov line is also a side line of line IV. This line was founded by Holger Rosenkrantz (1645-1704). Niels Rosenkrantz (1757-1824) of the Brusgaard line had inherited Barritskov from Staatsminister Frederik Christian ROSENKRANTZ (Barritskov estate near Hedensted in Midtjylland, according to whose will it was transferred to the Rosenkrantz family estate. The line became extinct in 1838 with Marcus Gi√∏e Rosenkrantz (1762‚Äì1838). =Line VII: Rydhave= Rydhave near Vinderup in Jutlanddescends from Stensballegaard, which in around 1440 descended from Hevringholm. The son of Axel Rosenkrantz (1472-1551) at Stensballegaard and Rydhave, Niels Rosenkrantz (1505-1581) inherited a part of Rydhave and subsequently acquired the parts of his brothers in 1551. =Line VIII: Glimminge= The Glimminge line started from the Rydhave line with Erik Rosenkrantz (born 1516) marrying firstly in 1551 the heiress of Glimminge Sk√•ne, Margrethe Boergesdatter Ulfstand (died 1582). Among his descendants were Holger Axelsen Rosenkrantz (1586-1647) of Glimmingehus etc. and Palle Rosenkrantz (1587-1642) of Krenkerup on Lolland, Noerregaard and Rosenlund. The line ended with Eleonore Gustaviane Rosenkrantz (1737-1825), when Glimminge had already been integrated into a fideimommiss. =Line IX: Older Scanian line= The older Scanian line (√òrup line) emanated from the Rydhave line, when Erik Rosenkrantz (born 1516) in 1551 married firstly Margrethe Ulfstand (see Rydhave). Oerup was inherited by his son Boerge (died 1614). The family remained on the √òrup estate after Sk√•ne in 1660 was ceded to Sweden. Holger Rosenkrantz (1688‚Äì1758) was in 1752 naturalized as Swedish nobleman under the surname Rosencrantz. They seem to have held Oerup until 1840, the line continuing at least until the end of the 20th century =Line X: Newer Scanian line= The newer Scanian line, which emanated from line IX in the beginning of the 18th century. Members of this family are still living in Sweden. =Line XI: Southern Jutlandic line / Soenderjyske linie at Kogsboel= The Southern Jutlandic line, which emanated from line I (Hevringholm) before 1355 (death of Erik Rosenkrantz at Hevringholm) and ended with the death after 1625 of Carsten Rosenkrantz at Gribsgaard, Kambo and Kogsboel, who outlived his son Bendix (died 1622). Rosenkrantz in Norway 250px =Rosenkrantz Tower= Rosenkrantz Tower (Rosenkrantzt√•rnet) is located near V√•gen in Bergen, Norway. Parts of the tower date back to the 1270s, but have been rebuilt several times. Erik Ottesen Rosenkrantz (1519-1575) was governor of Bergenhus Fortress from 1560 to 1568. In 1562, Rosenkrantz decided to build a combined defense and residence tower with five floors and facade towards Bryggen. The work was carried out by Scottish masons and the finished building had many common features with fortified Scottish towers of the time period. =Barony of Rosendal= 250px The history of Rosendal dates back to the 1650s, when Ludwig Holgersen Rosenkrantz (1628‚Äì1685) came to Bergen as commissioner of war for the Danish king. At a ball at the fortress of Bergenhus, he met Karen Axelsdatter Mowat (1630‚Äì1675), sole heiress to the largest fortune in the country at the time. Her father Axel Mowat (1592‚Äì1661) was a great land-owner, and had more than 550 farms all over Western Norway. They married in 1658, and were subsequently given the farm Hatteberg in Rosendal in Kvinnherad as a wedding present. In 1661, Ludwig Rosenkrantz started building his own manor at Rosendal. He completed this in 1665. In 1678, King Christian V of Denmark gave the estate the status of Barony of Rosendal (Baroniet Rosendal). It was and remained the only fief barony in Norway.

The family's name appears to be derived from the coat of arms, in which we find a wreath of heraldic roses instead of the usual torse between the helm and the crest. Coat of arms Modern drawing after the 18th century Roll of arms The standard arms of Rosenkrantz are party per bend gules and azure, a bend checky argent and sable. Above the helm and the wreath of roses, there is a peacock feather between two buffalo horns having four ditto feathers each. The horns are divided into silver and pattern, and pattern and red, respectively. The oldest known illustration of the standard arms is found in the Gelre Armorial of the 14th century.

He subsequently became the chief engineer and completed the canal between Bingley and Skipton before resigning in 1775. Career In 1766, Longbotham, together with John Hustler, a Bradford wool merchant and Quaker, called a public meeting at the Sun Inn, Bradford to discuss a broad canal linking Liverpool to Hull via the Aire and Calder Canal. He prepared a survey which was presented in 1768. To gain wider support the canal was promoted by committees in Bradford and Liverpool, with the Bradford committee controlling finances. The Liverpool committee objected to Longbotham's line down the valleys of the Calder and Ribble to Preston as it avoided a number of industrial Lancashire towns and suggested an alternative route which the Bradford committee found too long and expensive. James Brindley was brought in to arbitrate and ruled in favour of Longbotham's line and an Act of Parliament was passed in 1770. Although Brindley was appointed as chief engineer he did not take up the appointment and Longbotham was appointed as both chief engineer and clerk of works. By April 1773 the canal was open between Bingley and Skipton. In 1774 it was open between Liverpool and Newburgh and the Bingley Five Rise Locks and the Bradford branch were open. Meanwhile, he was also involved with surveys on the Bradford canal and the proposed Leeds and Selby Canal and bought coal mines at Upholland, near Wigan. Because of these activities the committee of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal complained that he was not spending enough time on their project and he either resigned his post or was dismissed because the accounts were not in order. In 1774, he started a packet service between Liverpool and Newburgh. In 1787 he was doing surveys for the proposed Lancaster Canal, with a route that combined navigation and drainage requirements. By 1791 he was brought back to advise the Leeds and Liverpool Canal committee on a new line in response to Robert Whitworth's proposal. In 1792 he did preparatory surveys for the Grand Western Canal crossing Devon and Somerset and worked on the proposed Bristol and Western Canal from the Avon to Taunton. By 1800 he was in poverty and when he died in 1801, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal paid for his funeral expenses.

It is contrasted with focus on forms,Sometimes the final \\"S\\" is capitalized, making focus on formS, or form- focused instruction,; this is done to more readily distinguish it from focus on form, which is limited solely to the explicit focus on language features, and focus on meaning, which is limited to focus on meaning with no attention paid to form at all. For a teaching intervention to qualify as focus on form and not as focus on forms, the learner must be aware of the meaning and use of the language features before the form is brought to their attention.. Focus on form was proposed by Michael Long in 1988.. This paper was originally presented at the European-North-American Symposium on Needed Research in Foreign Language Education, Bellagio, Italy, in 1988.  Background  The FonF (focus on form) model of practice introduced by Bahari (2019a) was prepared and contextualized based on the effectiveness of FonF-based instruction for its potential for incidental and preplanned L2 learning (Bahari, 2018a; Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004; Nassaji, 1999, 2016; Nassaji & Fotos, 2007, 2011; Williams, 2005). The FonF practice model has proved effective in catering for learners‚Äô nonlinear and dynamic motivational factors at individual level and taking advantage of the CALL affordances towards developing listening and speaking skills (Bahari, 2019a). In keeping with Nassaji and Fotos (2011) the FonF is considered as an optimal approach for learning which aims at mixing the best features of classroom L2 learning with computer-assisted L2 learning by using CALL tools and applications to facilitate L2 learning process. In contrast to previous L2 learning practice models sharing the feature of generality at group level, the FonF practice model addresses the nonlinearity and dynamicity of individual differences during learning process (Bahari, 2018a). This is in response to the call for integrating complex dynamic systems perspective (Larsen-Freeman & Cameron, 2008) towards implementing interactive-collaborative CALL environment. Under the FonF practice model, on the one hand, form, meaning and communication are addressed as critical learning components and on the other hand, individual learner‚Äôs motivation is catered to by selecting learning materials with respect to the nonlinearity and dynamicity of individual learners (D√∂rnyei & Ott√≥, 1998) in a systematic but flexible framework. The concept of focus on form was motivated by the lack of support for the efficacy of focus on forms on the one hand, and clear advantages demonstrated by instructed language learning over uninstructed learning on the other. The research conflicting with focus on forms has been wide-ranging;. learners typically acquire language features in sequences, not all at once,For review, see e.g. . and most of the stages the learners' interlanguages pass through will exhibit non- native-like language forms., . Furthermore, the progression of these stages is not clean; learners may use language features correctly in some situations but not in others,, . or they may exhibit U-shaped learning, in which native-like use may temporarily revert to non-native-like use.. None of these findings sit well with the idea that students will learn exactly what you teach them, when you teach it. In a review of the literature comparing instructed with uninstructed language learning, Long found a clear advantage for instructed learning in both the rate of learning and the ultimate level reached. An important finding that supported Long's view came from French language immersion programs in Canada; even after students had years of meaning-focused lessons filled with comprehensible input, their spoken language remained far from native-like, with many grammatical errors. This is despite the fact that they could speak fluently and had native-like listening abilities..

The enlisting of such areas is part of a strategy being used toward the conservation of the world's natural environment and biodiversity. The IUCN has developed the protected area management categories system to define, record, and classify the wide variety of specific aims and concerns when categorising protected areas and their objectives. This categorisation method is recognised on a global scale by national governments and international bodies such as the United Nations and the Convention on Biological Diversity.IUCN Guidelines for Applying Protected Area Management Categories, Published 2 October 2008  Categories  = Category Ia ‚Äì Strict Nature Reserve = A strict nature reserve (IUCN Category Ia) is an area which is protected from all but light human use in order to preserve the geological and geomorphic features of the region and its biodiversity. These areas are often home to dense native ecosystems that are restricted from all human disturbance outside of scientific study, environmental monitoring and education. Because these areas are so strictly protected, they provide ideal pristine environments by which external human influence can be measured. In some cases strict nature reserves are of spiritual significance for surrounding communities, and the areas are also protected for this reason. The people engaged in the practice of their faith within the region have the right to continue to do so, providing it aligns with the area's conservation and management objectives. Human impacts on strict nature reserves are increasingly difficult to guard against as climate and air pollution and newly emerging diseases threaten to penetrate the boundaries of protected areas. If perpetual intervention is required to maintain these strict guidelines, the area will often fall into category IV or V.Category Ia Strict Nature Reserve = Category Ib ‚Äì Wilderness Area = The Serengeti National Park, Tanzania is a designated Wilderness AreaData for Serengeti National Park (Category Ib) on Protected Planet A wilderness area (IUCN Category Ib) is similar to a strict nature reserve, but generally larger and protected in a slightly less stringent manner. These areas are a protected domain in which biodiversity and ecosystem processes (including evolution) are allowed to flourish or experience restoration if previously disturbed by human activity. These are areas which may buffer against the effects of climate change and protect threatened species and ecological communities. Human visitation is limited to a minimum, often allowing only those who are willing to travel of their own devices (by foot, by ski, or by boat), but this offers a unique opportunity to experience wilderness that has not been interfered with. Wilderness areas can be classified as such only if they are devoid of modern infrastructure, though they allow human activity to the level of sustaining indigenous groups and their cultural and spiritual values within their wilderness-based lifestyles. = Category II ‚Äì National Park = A national park (IUCN Category II) is similar to a wilderness area in its size and its main objective of protecting functioning ecosystems. However, national parks tend to be more lenient with human visitation and its supporting infrastructure. National parks are managed in a way that may contribute to local economies through promoting educational and recreational tourism on a scale that will not reduce the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The surrounding areas of a national park may be for consumptive or non-consumptive use but should nevertheless act as a barrier for the defence of the protected area's native species and communities to enable them to sustain themselves in the long term.Category II National Park = Category III ‚Äì Natural Monument or Feature = A natural monument or feature (IUCN Category III) is a comparatively smaller area that is specifically allocated to protect a natural monument and its surrounding habitats. These monuments can be natural in the wholest sense or include elements that have been influenced or introduced by humans. The latter should hold biodiversity associations or could otherwise be classified as a historical or spiritual site, though this distinction can be quite difficult to ascertain. To be categorised as a natural monument or feature by IUCN's guidelines, the protected area could include natural geological or geomorphological features, culturally-influenced natural features, natural cultural sites, or cultural sites with associated ecology. The classification then falls into two subcategories: those in which the biodiversity is uniquely related to the conditions of the natural feature and those in which the current levels of biodiversity are dependent on the presence of the sacred sites that have created an essentially modified ecosystem. Natural monuments or features often play a smaller but key ecological role in the operations of broader conservation objectives. They have a high cultural or spiritual value that can be utilised to gain support of conservation challenges by allowing higher visitation or recreational rights, therefore offering an incentive for the preservation of the site.Category III Natural Monument or Feature = Category IV ‚Äì Habitat/Species Management Area = The Gal√°pagos, Ecuador, is managed under category IV to preserve the islands' native flora and faunaData for The Gal√°pagos Islands (Category IV) on Protected Planet A habitat or species management area (IUCN Category IV) is similar to a natural monument or feature, but focuses on more specific areas of conservation (though size is not necessarily a distinguishing feature), like an identifiable species or habitat that requires continuous protection rather than that of a natural feature. These protected areas will be sufficiently controlled to ensure the maintenance, conservation, and restoration of particular species and habitats‚Äîpossibly through traditional means‚Äîand public education of such areas is widely encouraged as part of the management objectives. Habitat or species management areas may exist as a fraction of a wider ecosystem or protected area and may require varying levels of active protection. Management measures may include (but are not limited to) the prevention of poaching, creation of artificial habitats, halting natural succession, and supplementary feeding practices.Category IV Habitat/Species Management Area = Category V ‚Äì Protected Landscape/Seascape/Area = A protected landscape or protected seascape (IUCN Category V) covers an entire body of land or ocean with an explicit natural conservation plan, but usually also accommodates a range of for-profit activities. The main objective is to safeguard regions that have built up a distinct and valuable ecological, biological, cultural, or scenic character. In contrast with previous categories, Category V permits surrounding communities to interact more with the area, contributing to the area's sustainable management and engaging with its natural and cultural heritage. Landscapes and seascapes that fall into this category should represent an integral balance between people and nature and can sustain activities such as traditional agricultural and forestry systems on conditions that ensure the continued protection or ecological restoration of the area. Category V is one of the more flexible classifications of protected areas. As a result, protected landscapes and seascapes may be able to accommodate contemporary developments, such as ecotourism, at the same time as maintaining the historical management practices that may procure the sustainability of agrobiodiversity and aquatic biodiversity.Category V Protected Landscape/Seascape: =Category VI ‚Äì Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources= Satellite image of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, AustraliaData for The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Category VI) on Protected Planet Though human involvement is a large factor in the management of these protected areas, developments are not intended to allow for widescale industrial production. The IUCN recommends that a proportion of the land mass remains in its natural condition‚Äîa decision to be made on a national level, usually with specificity to each protected area. Governance has to be developed to adapt the diverse‚Äîand possibly growing‚Äîrange of interests that arise from the production of sustainable natural resources. Category VI may be particularly suitable to vast areas that already have a low level of human occupation or in which local communities and their traditional practices have had little permanent impact on the environmental health of the region. This differs from category V in that it is not the result of long-term human interaction that has had a transformative effect on surrounding ecosystems.Category VI Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources  See also  * UNEP-WCMC ‚Äî United Nations Environment Programme - World Conservation Monitoring Centre. * World Commission on Protected Areas * World Database on Protected Areas *IUCN protected area categories: :* Strict nature reserve ‚Äî Category Ia :* Wilderness area ‚Äî Category Ib :* National park ‚Äî Category II :* Natural monument and Natural feature ‚Äî Category III :* Habitat management area and Species management area ‚Äî Category IV :* Protected landscape and Protected seascape ‚Äî Category V :* Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources ‚Äî Category VI  References   External links  *IUCN Official IUCN Website *IUCN IUCN: Global Protected Area Programme *IUCN IUCN: World Commission on Protected Areas *World Database on Protected Areas *IUCN Databases *UNEP-WCMC Protected Areas Programme *WDPA's Management Effectiveness Information Module *2010 Biodiversity Indicators Partnership Indicator Factsheet: Management Effectiveness of Protected Areas *IUCN protected area categories: A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: IUCN Protected Area Categories A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: IUCN Category Ia ‚Äì Strict Nature Reserve A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: IUCN Category Ib ‚Äì Wilderness Area A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: IUCN Category II ‚Äì National Park A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: IUCN Category III ‚Äì Natural Monument or Feature A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: IUCN Category IV ‚Äì Habitat / Species Management Area A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: IUCN Category V ‚Äì Protected Landscape / Seascape A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: IUCN Category VI ‚Äì Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources 01 Ecology lists Nature-related lists Protected areas Protected areas ","title":"IUCN protected area categories"},{"id":"31466349","text":"Isorenieratene is a carotenoid light harvesting pigment with the chemical formula C40H48. Isorenieratene and its derivatives are useful to marine chemists studying the carbon cycle as biomarkers that indicate photic zone anoxia. Isorenieratene is produced by green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobium) which perform photosynthesis using hydrogen sulfide rather than water: :H2S + CO2 ‚Üí SO42‚àí + organic compounds Such anoxygenic photosynthesis requires reduced sulfur (and therefore strictly anaerobic conditions) and light (hŒΩ). This combination of conditions is very unusual nowadays, since it requires very stratified water columns to achieve a sharp density gradient, i.e. a constrained basin with fresh water flowing, or warm water on top of cooler water. Green sulfur bacteria are commonly found in meromictic lakes and ponds, sediments, and some sinkholes. Some marine environments, such as certain fjords and the Black sea also fulfill these criteria. In the early history of the Earth, however, these conditions were present in all oceans at depths of about . At such depths, sunlight has a very different wavelength profile than at the surface, so isorenieratene is used instead of chlorophyll to harvest light for photosynthesis.

In the Middle Ages, Lardea often changed hands between Bulgaria and Byzantium. History Lardea was founded in the late 3rd or early 4th century. In 705, it was ceded to the Bulgarian Empire along with the Zagore area by the Byzantine Empire. After the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian Treaty of 815, its fortifications were reinforced. Lardea was conquered by the Byzantine Empire in the aftermath of the Rus' invasion of Bulgaria (967‚Äì971). In 1051 or 1052, Nikephoros Bryennios defeated a Pecheneg detachment near Lardea. According to Alexiad by Anna Komnene, the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118) spent 40 days in the fortress during his war with the Pechenegs in 1088. In her account, Komnene describes the fortress as lying between Diampolis and Goloe. Lardea was conquered by the re-established Bulgarian Empire in the late 12th century. In 1186, the Bulgarian and Cuman forces of the brothers Asen and Peter engaged the troops of Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos, who were retreating to the fortress of Lardea amidst an anti- Bulgarian campaign. The Bulgarian army employed its cavalry to weaken the Byzantine force before organizing a successful all-out attack. Forced to retreat, Isaac II Angelos abandoned his campaign and fled to Adrianople. Lardea was captured by the Byzantines along with Ktenia in 1278 during the Uprising of Ivaylo. In 1304, emperor Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300‚Äì1321) regained north-eastern Thrace including Lardea for Bulgaria. The fortress became part of the enlarged Despotate of Kran, which served as the appanage of Aldimir, a Bulgarian noble loyal to his nephew Theodore Svetoslav. However, the fortress was lost once again during the interregnum after the premature death of Theodore Svetoslav's son George II Terter in 1322.Andreev, pp. 255-256 It was recovered by the new emperor Michael Shishman (r. 1323‚Äì1330) in 1324.Andreev, p. 256 After another brief Byzantine occupation between 1330 and 1332, it was once again in Bulgarian hands in the aftermath of the Battle of Rusokastro on 18 July 1332.Andreev, p. 268-270 In 1373, the Ottomans captured the important city of Diampolis and the surrounding fortresses including Lardea.

Plot The player adopts the role of a dragon, Thanatos the Destroyer, who must rescue a sorceress, Eros, from imprisonment by an evil Lord of the underworld. After she is recovered from the first castle, Thanatos must take her across the sea to find her spellbook, then carry her to a cauldron so she can complete a spell which will bring enlightenment to the land. Gameplay A screenshot of the ZX Spectrum version of Thanatos The player character Thanatos has two resources: Flame and Heart. Flame is expended by breathing fire. This attack is required to burn down the gate of the castle and may be used to burn foreground objects such as rocks, knights, horses, soldiers and different dangerous creatures (such as other dragons, huge spiders, and giant sea snakes). Flame may be recovered by eating witches, who may be found tied between stakes, though a knight could still ambush nearby. Heart is depleted as Thanatos is attacked by soldiers, knights, big creatures and rockfalls; this results in a quicker heartbeat and may finally cause an infarction. Heart is also spent when flying too fast for too long. Heart's level may be recovered by landing and walking slowly or staying still without being injured. Thanatos may also attack enemies by picking up an object in his claw and dropping them from a height; rocks and most enemies can be caught this way, even giant sea snakes. Thanatos opens his grasp when flying low - either ready to land or ready to catch something - and can catch an object if flying at a convenient height. Once Eros is rescued, she clings to Thanatos's neck, and rapidly turning may cause her to fall off. This is generally as well, for Thanatos can usually land near to wait for her climbing back; most of his enemies do not pay attention to her. But there are several special cases, which Thanatos should avoid at all costs: dropping Eros over the sea, for she would drown immediately; dropping Eros inside or even near a spider-infested cave, for she would be killed by a crawling spider, if Thanatos were not to land and take her away immediately; accidentally killing Eros himself, either by burning her (instant death) or catching her with the claw (the game will continue until the next landing, for there is no safe way to put an object back on the ground without crushing it). The player should not mistake her for a soldier, for she constantly waves her hands, drawing Thanatos' attention. If either of the two dies, the game ends, stating a reason why it is impossible to continue and complete it. The game ends in victory if the Thanatos carried Eros safely to her spellbook and then landed with her near the cauldron. Reception Thanatos was critically acclaimed. The ZX Spectrum version was Popular Computing Weekly's \\"Pick of the Week\\", and received a \\"CRASH Smash\\" accolade from CRASH, a \\"Megagame\\" award from Your Sinclair, 4 out of 5 stars from Sinclair User, and 8 out of 10 from Computer & Video Games. The size of the protagonist was highlighted in these reviews, the dragon sprite taking up a third of length of the display. On the animation of the dragon Jim Douglas commented that \\"the graphics really come into their own when you see the dragon flying over the landscape. The wings flap with superbly convincing swooshing sound effects, and the dragon waves his head around too.\\" CRASH opined \\"the movement of the main dragon is very smooth and realistic\\" and C&VG; found that Thanatos \\"is a big, nicely animated character who performs neat turns and landings on request.\\" The parallax scrolling background was also praised, as was the overall atmosphere and satisfaction of controlling a traditionally villainous creature. There were minor criticisms; CRASH felt that Thanatos was \\"a little too hard\\" and PCW concluded \\"I'm not 100% sure that it would keep you hooked for weeks on end.\\" Further reading *\\"The making of...

There was no smoking, no eating between meals, no candy, no evening dresses and no low-neck dresses. Jewelry was to be kept at a minimum, outings required chaperons and of course, bills had to be paid on time. There were no exceptions. Miss Dana's curriculum was classical and collegiate.

Facts Mr Jennings, a gardener and bricklayer, sued the administrators of his former employer, for a large house and furniture (worth ¬£435,000) on the ground that he had been given an assurance he would get it. Jennings worked as gardener of Mrs Royle since 1970 and from the late 1980s had increasingly begun to care for her, doing washing (laundry), helping dressing, shopping, overnight security following a break-in and in going to the toilet. She was running out of money and could not continue to pay him. She told him he need not worry about that since ‚Äúhe would be alright‚Äù and with more doubt expressed by the court, as to the claimant's recollection of exact words, perhaps words to the effect that ‚Äúthis will all be yours one day‚Äù, if not the court deemed then similar promises. Royle (who lived at Lawn House, Shapwick, Somerset) died in August 1997, aged 93, without a will and without issue. Jennings claimed that either he had: a claim under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975; or under a contract regarding land not falling foul of the Acts on formalities; or that he had a right to the house under the doctrine of proprietary estoppel. The administrator contested all three heads of claim. The High Court awarded Jennings ¬£200,000 taking into account the payments he had foregone, finding proprietary estoppel. It rejected his dependency claim, and stated that Royle's words had been too vague to make a contract or quasi-contract.[2001] WTLR 871 The Court of Appeal approved the first instance decision on quantum: > The judge reminded himself that the house was valued at ¬£420,000 and was not > a suitable house for [Jennings] to live in on his own and he took into > account that [Royle] had no special obligations to her family. He said that > to reward an employee on the scale of ¬£420,000 was excessive. He also > compared the cost of full-time nursing care, which he estimated at ¬£200,000, > with the value of the house. He reasoned that [Jennings] would probably need > ¬£150,000 to buy a house. He concluded: \\"I do not think that he could > complain that he had been unfairly treated if he had been left ¬£200,000 in > [Royle]'s will. Most people would say that she would, at least, then have > performed her promise to see him all right. The quality of her assurance > affects not only questions of belief, encouragement, reliance and detriment, > but also unconscionability and the extent of the equity. In my judgment the > minimum necessary to satisfy the equity in the present case is the sum of > ¬£200,000.\\" Jennings appealed to the Court of Appeal for the full value of the house (under the found proprietary estoppel). Rice for the statutory beneficiaries of the death estate argued including the nieces and nephews argued that instead of the full value of the house -- the maximum awardable -- the reviewing court should uphold the decision below which took into account the actual detriment experienced. Judgment The Court of Appeal held that the High Court had made a correct assessment: proportionality was essential between expectation and detriment in deciding how to satisfy an equity based on proprietary estoppel. The detriment to Jennings was more difficult to establish than his expectation, however courts must consider unconscionability.

FortressCraft cites Minecraft, Infiniminer and Dwarf Fortress as direct inspirations for the design aspect of the game. The game utilizes textured voxels to simulate landscapes, traditionally reminiscent of other titles in the genre. FortressCraft makes use of Xbox Live Avatars that are associated with each player's Gamertag. The first and only chapter of FortressCraft has no set parameters, quests, or objectives‚Äîgamers are to forge their own personal worlds block-by-block alone or with friends on Xbox Live. Gameplay Upon starting a new game, players spawn on a water-filled tower in a randomly generated world. From this point they may start exploring their world or assembling structures with the various block sets given to them. Conversely they may also choose to dig through the ground, hunting for Relics that give bonuses such as the ability to fly, to jump higher, to place TNT charges and blow up blocks, and more. There are currently a total of 615 different cubic blocks in the game, each with their own pattern and design, along with 64 custom user-defined blocks. These cubic blocks in conjunction with the custom user-defined blocks can be used to build anything the player wants. The blocks vary from simple color and texture variants to being quite unique‚Äîthe trampoline block, for example, is a unique block that propels players up in the air higher and higher with each jump. There are four game modes playable in the latest version of FortressCraft: * Freezetag ‚Äì a variation of \\"tag\\", one player holds a freeze-ray and has to shoot another player to pass it on. * Spleef ‚Äì all players start on a canvas block arena, they have to shoot out the canvas from underneath the other players. Once a player touches a block that isn't a canvas, they are \\"spleefed\\" and out of the game, and the last man standing wins. * Hunt ‚Äì one player is \\"the hunter\\", a character that has partial invisibility and sees with vision similar to thermal imaging. This player has to find and attack the other players who have none of the perks listed above, the last player who hasn't been 'hunted' is the round winner. A new hunter is chosen for the next round. * FPS mode (Fight, Protect, Survive) ‚Äì this game mode was introduced in the 1.1 alpha patch. Two types of mob are spawned in the map: \\"harvesters\\" and \\"wasps\\". The player is required to kill the mobs to collect gears which are used to buy various items used in the game mode. This game mode is in very early stages of development and is likely to change in future patches. The game also features a \\"Workshop\\", where the player can place down blocks to make an 8 x 8 x 8 block scale model which is then transformed into a single custom block allowing players to make unique blocks. These blocks can have effects added to them to allow them to rotate, wiggle, emit smoke, and many other actions when placed. In a recent update new custom block effects were added, one such instance makes custom blocks emit lasers. When these lasers hit a \\"factory\\" custom type, the factory emits a \\"doodad\\". In its default state the doodad appears as a crate with the ProjectorGames logo, but the appearance can be changed upon placing a custom block on top of the factory. The doodads are affected by gravity and can be moved about on \\"conveyor\\" custom blocks or launched from \\"jumppad\\" customs. Ports In 2012 it was announced that FortressCraft was to be released on the OnLive marketplace. Adam Sawkins stated that he was looking forward to having FortressCraft playable on the multiple platforms that OnLive provides, specifically the mobile versions. It was also announced that FortressCraft would be a part of the OnLive PlayPack subscription service. After Onlive was bought out, communications stopped between Sawkins and Onlive. FortressCraft is now ported to the Unity game engine as \\"FortressCraft Evolved\\", allowing multiple platform support. Reception FortressCraft was met with favorable sales. Within the first two days of the game's release it was downloaded 40,000 times and purchased around 35,000 times. In August 2011, FortressCraft became the highest-grossing Xbox Live Indie Game title, with over one million dollars in sales. FortressCraft retained this record until May 2012, when Total Miner was announced to have sold 800,000 copies. As of May 1, 2012, the game has sold 750,000 units. Markus Persson, the creator of Minecraft, commented on the game, saying \\"FortressCraft is an obvious attempt to just take something popular and clone it as closely as possible. I still think it's important that people are allowed and able to do things like that, but it's hardly graceful.\\" Adam Sawkins first responded to the criticism with an open letter to Persson, citing Minecraft as an inspiration, but crediting the differences present in FortressCraft. Sawkins later defended the credibility of FortressCraft in a feature run by IGN, stating, \\"It might do well on the name alone, but if you want sexy graphics and shaders and the creative aspect, you have FortressCraft. If you want to fight monsters and share stuff with your friends, you have Total Miner. Nobody will pay for Minecraft when they can pay $3.00 for Total Miner or FortressCraft\\". When asked about Mojang's perception of FortressCraft, the company's business chief Daniel Kaplan stated that they were bored with the video game clones, but that no legal action would be taken against ProjectorGames. Adam Sawkins responded to Kaplan's comments in an interview with Eurogamer, pointing out key differences between the vox games on the Xbox Live Marketplace and Minecraft. He also addressed how he believed the word \\"clone\\" was being unfairly used against recent vox games, whereas Minecraft, originally a clone of Infiniminer, did not receive the same treatment.

The ship was laid down as a at the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard at Hingham, Massachusetts on 23 June 1943, with the hull number DE-84, and launched on 18 September 1943. The ship was transferred to the UK under Lend- Lease on 20 November 1943, and named after either Captain Henry Curzon, who commanded at the First Battle of Groix (1795), or Captain Edward Curzon who commanded at the Battle of Navarino (1827). There is official uncertainty about which is correct. Service history Curzon was attached to the 16th Escort Group, based at Sheerness, part of Nore Command, for coastal convoy escort duty. She was not involved in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, but afterwards escorted convoys to the invasion beaches. On 21 July Curzon and sank the south of Beachy Head. Towards the end of 1944 Curzon became a Coastal Forces Control Frigate (CFCF), controlling a flotilla of Motor Torpedo Boats operating in the Channel and North Sea to counter the threat of enemy E-boats. On the night of 22/23 December 1944, Curzon, , the destroyer and the sloop were on patrol off Ostend when they engaged a group of mine-laying E-boats. Curzon sank S912 and damaged two others. On 14/15 January 1945 Curzon and the destroyer were on patrol off Westkapelle, when a group of five E-boats fired on a convoy with long-range torpedoes, claiming two hits. Curzon and Cotswold attacked, scattering the enemy. At 01:27 on 17 January 1945 Curzon and Cotswold were patrolling off the Scheldt estuary when they made radar contact with two groups of E-Boats. Cotswold attacked the nearest group, while Curzon closed to within 3,000 yards of the other before opening fire. The enemy laid a smoke screen and retreated at high speed into shallow water. The E-boats regrouped and attempted another attack, but it was also repulsed. Curzon was then refitted at Tilbury. Her 2-pounder \\"pom pom\\" bow chaser was removed, the two 20 mm Oerlikons mounted in front of the bridge were replaced with two single 40 mm Bofors, and splinter shields were fitted to her guns. After VE Day Curzon was refitted for service with the British Pacific Fleet, but this assignment was later cancelled, and she remained in home waters until returned to the U.S. Navy on 27 March 1946.

Founded in 1962, it was the second integrated school to be established in Singapore. It is currently located in the satellite town of Yishun. The school is named after Ahmad Bin Ibrahim, the first Minister for Health of the Republic of Singapore, who was remembered as a politician in Singapore's history who \\"garnered the support of all races at a time when communal relations were sensitive and volatile\\". History = Ahmad Ibrahim Integrated Secondary School (1962‚Äì1986) = Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School was established in 1962 as Ahmad Ibrahim Integrated Secondary School (AISS). The name \\"Ahmad Ibrahim\\" commemorated Ahmad Bin Ibrahim, an ethnic-Malay community leader and politician who died in August of that year. It was the second integrated school established after the introduction of the integrated education scheme in 1960. The school was declared open by Lee Khoon Choy, who was at the time the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Education. The school adopted the motto of \\"Tolerance and Cooperation\\", as its aim was to break away from the language barriers that existed in most schools then. Chia Meng An was appointed as the first Principal. The school begun functioning in 1963, with both Chinese and English streams. In 1967 the school was selected as the first pilot school for the Open Education Programme for the blind, which aimed to place visually-impaired students in mainstream secondary school through providing adequate support and facilities. In 1985 the school moved to a new building in Yishun. It was the first school to function in the new satellite town. The last batch of Chinese stream students graduated from Ahmad Ibrahim Integrated Secondary School in 1986, the same year that the institution was renamed as Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School to reflect the transition into an English stream school. = Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School (1986‚Äìpresent) = In 1987, the school received the Guinness Stout Effort award for its Open Education Program, which was given out by Tan Cheng Bock, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Education. In 2006, Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School was recognised as a Niche Programme School for shooting due to its strong track record in that sport. In 2012, Ahmad Ibrahim celebrated its 50th anniversary, with President of Singapore Tony Tan launching a heritage gallery and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam launching a student centre as part of the celebrations. School culture and identity = School Crest = The torch with its red glowing flame symbolizes the light of integrity and the warmth of compassion. The twirling background design together with the torch is a stylized depiction of the letters \\"ai\\", the abbreviated form of the school's name. The green colour represents the school's value of harmony in a multi-racial, multi-religious school, and the silver colour its perseverance in the pursuit of excellence. =Uniform and discipline= Junior (secondary 1 and 2) boys wear light grey short trousers. Senior boys wear grey long trousers. Girls wear a green skirt. All students wear a white shirt with the school badge, and white socks. Conduct marks are given for compliance with the school's expectations, including responsibility and appropriate work habits. Detention and (for male students) corporal punishment are penalties for misbehaviour. For \\"Category 1\\" (serious) offences such as truancy, defiance, smoking, vandalism and fighting, at the first offence, boys receive caning plus detention, while girls receive extended detention. The same penalties apply to a repeated \\"Category 2\\" offence such as latecoming, chewing gum or use of electronic devices. The less serious offences are punished with detention or Cleaning Work Order. Co- curricular activities The school has produced several outstanding shooters who went on to represent Singapore in major competitions, and has consistently been ranked highly for the National Inter-school Shooting Championships for its 10 metre air rifle event (as part of the International Shooting Sports Federation (ISSF) shooting event) despite its background as a neighbourhood school in Yishun. After being awarded as the Niche Programme School for shooting, the school has since received a boost in funding, and is allowed to admit students based on their potential in shooting via Direct School Admission.

The sole appellate judge, the Lord Chancellor of England and Wales held: \\"by virtue of the original gift made by the testator and of the subsequent expenditure by the Plaintiff with the approbation [approval] of the testator, and of the right and obligation resulting therefrom, the Plaintiff is entitled to have a conveyance.\\" Facts In 1847 the parties' father (Lewis Weston Dillwyn of Sketty Hall) earlier bequeathed his lands on trust to his widow for life and with a complex remainder so that his younger son, the \\"plaintiff\\", would inherit absolutely if he obtained 21 years of age; otherwise charged with annuities (equity partly-released) for certain daughters and thereafter to the defendant (and his heirs). He later wished to give immediately to the plaintiff (Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn) one of these parcels, his farm at Hendrefoilan near to Sketty Hall, and thought he had done so by signing a memorandum presenting it to him ‚Äúfor the purpose of furnishing himself with a dwelling-house‚Äù. The memorandum was not a deed -- a proper deed would make it binding to all the world at common law. The younger son, the plaintiff, incurred great expense in building a house on the land. The elder son and father signed and dated the memorandum. Two years later in 1855 the father died and the elder son (John Dillwyn Llewelyn) disputed his younger brother's imperfect title (ownership). The widow, noted photographer, Mary Dillwyn died in 1906 and chose to waive her life interest in the property. At first instance, Sir John Romilly MR decreed that the claimant was entitled to a life interest (possession for life in the estate in land, worth ¬£14,000).

The documentary examines the causes of the Greek debt crisis in 2010 and advocates for the default of \\"odious debt\\". The documentary has been distributed online under a Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 license since 6 April 2011, and the production said that it has no interest in any kind of commercial exploitation of the project. The documentary is available in Greek and English and is subtitled in French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. According to The Nation, half a million people watched the film in the first five days of its release.Debtocracy at VideoNation The film was followed by a Greek-language book with the same title. Name The production team coined the word \\"debtocracy\\" (Greek \\"ŒßœÅŒµŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±\\"), defining it as the condition by which Greece found itself trapped in its debt. The term is derived from the words \\"œáœÅŒ≠ŒøœÇ\\" (debt) and the Greek \\"Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ\\" (power, rule -ocracy). The title implies that the Greek government has been functioning mainly under the interests of the financial debt (at points superseding or even replacing the principles of Democracy and the Constitution of Greece), and therefore the debt has been elevated as a de facto form of government by itself. Content summary PIIGS. The documentary opens with the statements of Greek Prime Ministers, starting with the dictator Georgios Papadopoulos and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and ending with some of the most prominent figures in Greek politics since the metapolitefsi: Andreas Papandreou, Konstantinos Mitsotakis, Kostas Simitis, Kostas Karamanlis and the then Prime Minister George Papandreou. The focus then shifts to the prelude to the recent global economic crisis and its origins in the 1970s. Interviews with prominent figures of the global philosophical and economic scene argue that the euro is non-viable and contributed to the worsening of the finances of Greece due to a systematic loss of competitiveness in the markets by the PIGS. The documentary traces the roots of the Greek debt back to the revolution of 1821 and the British loans that were issued. The documentary criticises the notion that the Greek population, since it enjoyed the country's prosperity produced by past loans, is now accountable as a whole for the debts. Debtocracy argues Greek politicians encouraged too much borrowing and corruption. The documentary praises Ecuador's decision to unilaterally default on part of its sovereign debt, on grounds of social justice. The solution suggested for the Greek crisis is the formation of a committee for the analysis of the debt in a similar way that Ecuador did. If the analysis proves all or part of the debt to be odious the people should not have to pay for it and therefore it should be erased, the film argues. Production and participation The production team of Debtocracy have said that the producers are all those individuals that donated money in order to finance the project. Interviewees include: *David Harvey, geographer and social theorist *Hugo Arias, president of the debt analysis committee of Ecuador *Samir Amin, economist *Eric Toussaint, political scientist and spokesperson of the Committee for the Abolition of Illegitimate Debt *G√©rard Dum√©nil *Costas Lapavitsas, economist *Alain Badiou, philosopher *Manolis Glezos, member of the Greek Resistance and left-wing politician *Avi Lewis, journalist and film director * Sahra Wagenknecht Critical response The documentary has received mixed reviews, both for its use of economics and its political intention as a film, both by Greek and international media. The documentary depicted scenes where Argentinian and Ecuadorian politicians had to evacuate the besieged parliaments by means of a helicopter. Iconic images and references to helicopters were adopted by the Aganaktismenoi movement who surrounded the Greek Parliament in 2011. Critics of the film make four main points: ; Accusation of propaganda : The film is suspected to be only a part of a marxist propaganda ; False comparison of Greece with Argentina and Ecuador : The film argues that Argentina and Ecuador were right to default but the comparison has been described as incorrect. ; Lack of opposing point of views : Only people in favor of a Greek default were questioned ; No alternative propositions : Only a cancellation of the Greek debt is invoked. Nothing about the competitiveness of the Greek economy. Writing for the British newspaper The Guardian, Aditya Chakrabortty said the movie's criticism of the euro was \\"compelling\\" and, despite its low budget, called the documentary \\"the best film of Marxian economic analysis yet produced\\". Major Greek newspapers such as To Vima and Kathimerini have criticized the documentary as a work of political propaganda. To Vima argues that Greece's and Ecuador's economies have little in common, as Ecuador is a major oil producer for its size and population, contrary to Greece. A similar critical review was published by Kathimerini, stating that Debtocracy is aimed at promoting political propaganda rather than objectively presenting a proposed solution to the Greek crisis. Kathimerini's review also echoed that of To Vima, saying that the examples of both Ecuador and Argentina are unfortunate as they bear no resemblance to Greece and come in full contrast with the documentary's line of argument. Other Greek media that have criticized the film include Skai TV. = In universities = Professor of Economics at the University of Athens wrote a letter to the producers of Debtocracy explaining the reasons for which he refused to be included in the documentary production team, and said among other things that he does not believe that Greece and Argentina have anything in common and that a default would not be an easy solution. Former Aristotle University of Thessaloniki professor Eleftheria Karnavou wrote a letter to the newspaper Agelioforos arguing that being completely against the documentary is unjustified, even though it is politically and scientifically unfounded, as it provides food for thought. = Response to criticisms = When asked about the one-sidedness of the film by the Greek newspaper Eleftherotypia, the producers replied that they had made it clear from the start who was funding the project, that they used abstracts from documentaries produced by reporters of the BBC, and that those people that speak out against Debtocracy are the same people that find the television news broadcasts to be objective and credible.

WCD first came to prominence in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill to determine potential liability if another oil spill were to occur. History The now defunct Minerals Management Service planned to implement Worst Case Discharge studies before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill though the first actual was performed in August 2010 to model the Deepwater Horizon spill. In January 2011, several major oil and gas companies were allowed to resume deepwater drilling while Worst Case Discharge studies were being completed. In March 2011, the Worst Case Discharge study on the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill was released to the public in the Flow Rate Technical Group final report. Calculation methods =Analytical equations= Analytical equations are the simplest method for calculating WCD. However analytical equations cannot account for the rapid change in pressure and saturation near the well bore and have been replaced by simulation modeling. =Reservoir simulation= Reservoir simulation is the method used by the BOEMRE to calculate WCD as simulation can accurately model the rapid changes near well bore that occur in an uncontrolled blow out event. The BOEMRE currently uses the Merlin finite difference simulator and nodal analysis package to perform all WCD studies since using the software to determine the official flow rate for the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Engineers typically use radial modeling to calculate WCD as a radial model can employ sufficiently small grid cell sizes around the well bore that increase in volume as cells extend into the aquifer. Full field modeling is generally only needed if a geologic barrier like a fault or pinch out is close enough to the well being studied there is pressure interference. Engineers also need to calculate the highest rate in each combination of geologic layers as the well is drilled. The WCD rate can be higher in certain cases if specific layers blowout rather than the entire reservoir as different combinations of aquifers, gas layers, and oil layers can limit or enhance flow.

There are almost no historical sources about her. Her name is mentioned in the Boril obituary in the following manner: The interpretation of the cited extract is not certain. It is possible that Maria and Kira Maria were two different women. It is known that Ivan Shishman had a second wife - Dragana, daughter of Prince Lazar of Serbia and Milica. Prince Lazar did not have a wife called Desislava and therefore it is possible that the name of the emperor's first wife was only Maria, while Dragana could have been called Kira Maria, unless there was a mistake in the paragraph and the places of the two empresses were changed. Another possibility is that the two names were of one person, the first wife of the emperor, mentioned once as Kira Maria and then as Maria. That option, however, raises the question why is the name of the second wife of Ivan Shishman omitted. It has been suggested that Kira Maria descended by an important noble family from the capital Tarnovo. The names of children produced by the first marriage of Ivan Shishman are unknown.

Hope Davies' solicitors delayed making requisitions and completion till the deed was sent, and this put Ogilvy at a loss. Ogilvy sued for losses resulting from the delayed completion.

The late delivery of the deed of appointment, together with a letter sent by the vendors asking that all the requisitions be raised at the same time, amounted to a waiver by Ogilvy of the time limits on requisitions, and it would be inequitable to allow them to claim for losses occasioned by the delay.

Its purpose was to determine if nuclear explosions could be useful in fracturing rock formations for natural gas extraction.Project Gasbuggy. Popular Mechanics, September 1967. The site, lying in the Carson National Forest, is approximately southwest of Dulce, New Mexico and east of Farmington, and was chosen because natural gas deposits were known to be held in sandstone beneath Leandro Canyon.A Good Start for Gasbuggy.

The detonation produced a rubble chimney that was wide and high above the blast center.Gasbuggy Nuclear Test Site . Center for Land Use Interpretation. Accessed April 11, 2011. After an initial surface cleanup effort the site sat idle for over a decade. A later surface cleanup effort primarily tackled leftover toxic materials. In 1978, a marker monument was installed at the Surface Ground Zero (SGZ) point that provided basic explanation of the historic test. Below the main plaque lies another which indicates that no drilling or digging is allowed without government permission. The site is publicly accessible via the Carson National Forest, F.S. 357 dirt road/Indian J10 that leads into the Carson National Forest. Following the Project Gasbuggy test, two subsequent nuclear explosion fracturing experiments were conducted in western Colorado in an effort to refine the technique. They were Project Rulison in 1969 and Project Rio Blanco in 1973. In both cases the gas radioactivity was still seen as too high and in the last case the triple-blast rubble chimney structures disappointed the design engineers. Soon after that test the ~ 15-year Project Plowshare program funding dried up. These early fracturing tests were later superseded by hydraulic fracturing technologies.

Tensions had mounted as the Druze captured an Egyptian garrison outside of Safed.Rossoff, David. Safed: the mystical city. p.162-165. The local Safed militia of several hundred was heavily outnumbered by the Druze, and the city was gripped in despair as the militia eventually abandoned the city and the Druze rebels entered the city on July 5.p. 189 The Druze rebels and a Muslim mob descended on the Jewish quarter of Safed and, in scenes reminiscent of the Safed plunder four years earlier, spent three days attacking Jews, plundering their homes and desecrating their synagogues.

Among them was Israel Beck, whose printing press had been destroyed a second time. Prelude By the 19th-century, the Galilean city of Safed comprised a major Jewish center. It had become a kabbalistic centre during the 16th-century, reaching a size of about 15,000 at its peak. Despite the decline through the 17th and 18th centuries, by the 1830s there were still around 3,500-4,000 Jews living there, comprising at least half the population. The Jews of Safed had been subjected to a prolonged attack in 1834 during the Peasants' Revolt: Over 5,000 Arab peasant rebels had launched a revolt protesting against legislation imposed by the new Egyptian ruler Muhammad Ali and some had used the uprising as an opportunity to attack the Jews. After several months, the Egyptians managed to crush the rebellion and regain control of the county and the Jews of Safed began to rehabilitate themselves. Not long after, Safed was again the scene of devastation when in 1837 a strong earthquake resulted in thousands of deaths and the destruction of many buildings.\\"The earthquake of 1 January 1837 in Southern Lebanon and Northern Israel\\" by N.

Bloch - 1987 and a full-scale Druze revolt erupted in January. In summer of 1838, the Druze captured a heavily outnumbered Egyptian garrison outside Safed. The attack The Jewish population relied on the protection of an Arab governor against the Druze. Dr. Elizer Loewe wrote in his diary: :We huddled together in Rebbe Avraham Dov's house... The women were hysterical and the children crying. The Rebbe asked me to write a note in Arabic to the mayor, pleading with him not to forsake us in this desperate time. I did so, but his answer was mere lip service. According to Loewe, the mayor and his militia fled the city, and the Jews became Open prey for the ravenous rebels. The Druze rebels were joined by Muslim mob and they looted the Jewish quarters, as the Druze rebels thought the Jews possessed hidden treasures and local Muslims encouraged them to attack. The plunder lasted for 3 days. During the course of the attack, some Jews were assisted by friendly Arabs. One Arab by the name of Muhammed Mustafa, had helped protect them, lending them money and providing them with food and clothing.Emile Marmorstein (1975).

Bernard showed talent as a schoolboy, but his request to study art was refused. He spent two or three years working in an office and the merchant who found sketches and drawings instead of figures in the ledgers gave him a commission to make a portrait of his wife. With the merchant's encouragement, Bernard was sent to a drawing master and afterwards to a drawing academy. The last few years as a student were made easier by his success in gaining the subsidy from the Dutch Queen, which he held for two years. He worked for some time under one of the greatest Dutch animal painters, Jan van Essen, and copied many of the old masters, such as Pieter de Hooch and Frans Hals. His painting from nature enabled him to understand the old masters. During the year 1886 De Hoog's talent became noticed. He had admired the paintings of Jozef Isra√´ls and Albert Neuhuys. The first great picture that he exhibited was shown in Amsterdam, entitled 'During the Sermon in the new Church'. The Mother Soon De Hoog came to be a painter of interiors, because he lived in a village rich in them. He painted interiors for four years, and then migrated to other provinces with his family. His effective talent was by this time fully appreciated, and people understood his originality. Although influenced by the work of Isra√´ls, no one can deny the individuality of De Hoog. De Hoog followed the Hague School, primarily a movement of realism, a reaction against the previous mood of romanticism. He was advocating the simple country life, a happy and innocent atmosphere where children play a major part. He painted many small pictures of the life of the country people, of the homes of the peasants, with the light shining through the ancient windows. De Hoog had a developed mind and excellent taste. In the simple appearance of the simple life of the Dutch people he discovered a beauty of thought which dictated his management of tone, he knew exactly the way to express the sentiment that was in him. On the Continent his pictures attracted much attention, and he was well received in the Netherlands, where his popular scenes were exhibited and sold at many provincial and National galleries. His paintings were also readily exported around the world, especially to the US, Canada, and England. De Hoog died at the Hague in 1943.

Life as a solar energy advocate Born in 1938 in Paris, Dominic Michaelis studied architecture and engineering at Cambridge. His thesis, written in 1964, was on a solar house and a floating solar village. He continued at Cornell studying for an MS in architectural structures and town planning.Full biography including image at  In 1974 Michaelis opened a consultancy to design solar buildings, one of which received the first joint RIBA, RICS and CIBSE award. He consulted for many known solar heated or cooled projects, being responsible for some of the early solar and low energy houses in Milton Keynes. He also built many projects abroad including neighborhoods and structures, in Pisa, Rome, Marrakech, Barbados and Mali, where he built five pise walled low cost health clinics for the EU.A list of projects by Michaelis on Solar Energy LTD website, the company that continued Michaelis' projects. A full description of the projects can be found on Michaelis's bio page. Solar balloon Dominic Michaelis imagined a hot air balloon flying only by solar power. He built and tested small solar balloons with a double skin envelope. The temperature differential between the skins provided lift. His son St√©phane became the first human pilot lifted by a solar tethered balloon. In 1972, Michaelis built a 240 panel, 22 meter diameter solar balloon using polyester film and aluminum honeycomb basket. Inside the solar ballon, three vertical black screens heated through the greenhouse effect and the black screens absorbed energy through the transparent polyester film. His tethered test flights showed strong thermodynamic forces. Inspired by US pioneer Tracy Barnes' first manned solar balloon flight on 1 May 1973, Michaelis designed a free flight solar balloon. The design included a double envelope; the internal layer black polyester, while the outer was transparent. He hired Cameron Balloons in Bristol to build solar balloon G-BAVU. The solar balloon's envelopes worked in tandem: transparent surface allowed air to flow in, enabling a greenhouse effect and absorbed the trapped solar radiation from the black envelope. The twin envelopes were attached to a basket carrying a gas burner. The burner eased inflation and aided launch with cloudy skies. Altitude control was achieved through opening or closing horizontal panels located at the balloon equator. The deflation was made possible by rip-stop panels at the balloon crowns. From 1976 to 1980, his balloon (aircraft registration number G-BAVU) participated in a number of hot air balloon festivals in England. Julian Nott used Dominic Michaelis's solar balloon (aircraft registration number G-BAVU) to cross the English channel. On 22 August 1981, lifting off North West of Dover, he silently crossed the channel, landing at Tournehem-sur-la-Hem of the Pas-de- Calais in France. Nott used the burner once, during the landing, to arrest the descent rate. The envelope of solar balloon G-BAVU is conserved at the British Balloon Museum, a testament to its groundbreaking status in balloon travel history. Energy innovations An idea for a wave energy converter was formulated and patented in 1980 with engineer John Field. Peter Rice a senior partner of ARUPS became interested in the project and a test was carried out at sea to validate the concept. The wave energy converter known as THE LILYPAD, is based on recovering energy from seas and oceans using flexible membranes only. It is now being developed for trials in the Mediterranean. In 1990 Michaelis developed a low cost geodesic geometry solar cooker, which cooks at over two hundred degrees Celsius. It also boils five litres of water in twenty minutes and can therefore sterilise 100 litres of water a day. In 2002 he patented the 'Energy Island' concept following a Call for Ideas by the International OTEC Association, a proposal for an offshore platform that would employ various techniques to generate renewable energy. His son Alex Michaelis continues his father's solar projects, and particularly the energy island idea.Treehugger: Michaelis also holds patents which dispense OTEC from the cold water pipe concept, removing many environmental and economic concerns. Dominic Michaelis died on 22 December 2015 after a long battle with illness.

Edwards escaped from jail in Akron, Ohio in 1955 and fled across the country, holding up gas stations. By 1961, he was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Edwards was captured and arrested in Atlanta, Georgia on January 20, 1962. After he was granted parole in 1967, Edwards murdered at least five people between 1977 and 1996, and he is suspected of several additional killings. Background Edwards was born in Akron, Ohio in 1933. In his autobiography Edwards wrote that he grew up in an orphanage, and that he was abused both physically and emotionally by nuns there. Edwards was allowed out of juvenile detention to join the U.S. Marines, but he eventually went and was dishonorably discharged. He traveled frequently during his 20s and 30s, working assorted jobs such as working as a ship docker, vacuum cleaner retailer and handyman. In 1955, Edwards escaped from a jail in Akron and drifted around the country robbing gas stations. He wrote that he never disguised himself during crimes because he wanted to be famous. He was placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list in 1961. After his 1962 capture, he was imprisoned in Leavenworth, from which he was paroled in 1967. Edwards claimed that the influence of a benevolent guard at Leavenworth reformed him. He married and became a motivational speaker. Edwards appeared on two television shows, To Tell the Truth (1972) and What's My Line? He wrote an autobiography, The Metamorphosis of a Criminal: The True Life Story of Ed Edwards, in 1972. By 1982 he had returned to crime, and was imprisoned in Pennsylvania for two years for arson. Between 1974 and 2009, Edwards lived in more than a dozen different states when not incarcerated, according to his daughter April, using many false names. In a 1993 letter to the FBI found in his papers, Edwards requested his criminal and history records for cities in 19 States, claimed that J. Edgar Hoover \\"more or less gave me permission to proceed\\" with his 1972 autobiography \\"after I assured him there was nothing in it bad about the FBI\\" and he was writing a new book about criminals he met while incarcerated, such as Tony Provenzano, Charles Manson and Jimmy Hoffa. = Arrest and conviction = In 2009, Edwards was arrested for murder in Louisville, Kentucky. Neighbors described him as pleasant and neighborly. In 2010, he pleaded guilty to the murders of Billy Lavaco, 21, of Doylestown, Judith Straub, 18, of Sterling, Ohio, Tim Hack, 19, and Kelly Drew, 19, both of Jefferson, Wisconsin. Soon after, in a jailhouse interview, Edwards confessed to killing Dannie Law Gloeckner, 25. In 2011, he was sentenced to death for that killing. Known murders The first murders for which Edwards was convicted, of Billy Lavaco and Judy Straub, took place in Ohio in 1977. He received life sentences for these crimes in 2010. The second pair of murders, another double homicide, occurred in Concord, Wisconsin in 1980 when Tim Hack and Kelly Drew were stabbed and strangled. These were referred to as the \\"Sweetheart Murders.\\" Edwards had been questioned at the time, but there was no basis to hold him. Almost 29 years later, his connection to the crime was established by means of DNA testing. Edwards' own child, April Balascio, tipped off police about his possible involvement. Edwards confessed to the 1996 murder of 25-year-old Dannie Boy Edwards in Burton, Ohio. The victim had lived with Edwards and his family for several years as an unofficial adopted son. Dannie's original name was Dannie Law Gloeckner. Edwards murdered Gloeckner in a scheme to collect insurance money. Edwards was sentenced to death for this crime in March 2011. He died in prison of natural causes a month later. Other possible murders According to Phil Stanford in his book The Peyton-Allan Files, Edwards may have been responsible for the murders of Beverly Allan and Larry Peyton in Portland, Oregon, in 1960. Two men were arrested and imprisoned for these murders, but released from prison early. Authorities maintain that the correct persons were prosecuted. In March 2017, Detective Chad Garcia of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office who was in charge of the \\"Sweetheart Murders\\" case described how the murders of Hack and Drew were solved following a tip off from Edwards' daughter. Garcia said he was \\"pretty confident\\" there are at least five to seven more murders Edwards committed and \\"who knows beyond that.\\" He gave a list of 15 confirmed and suspected victims, adding that he was less sure Edwards was involved in the Zodiac killings. Like many serial killers, Edwards attempted to take credit for several high-profile cases, including the Zodiac killings in the Bay Area of California and the murder of JonBen√©t Ramsey. Death Edwards died of natural causes at the Corrections Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio on April 7, 2011, avoiding execution by lethal injection set for August 31. In media In October 1972, Edwards appeared on the television game show To Tell The Truth, claiming to be reformed and denying having committed any murders. In 2014, Golden Door Press published It's Me, Edward Wayne Edwards, the Serial Killer You Never Heard Of, by former police detective and cold case investigator John A. Cameron. The book and Cameron's claims were \\"met with almost universal disdain, especially from law enforcement\\". In March 2017, A&E; broadcast a Cold Case Files episode\\"Cold Case Files (2017-)\\" \\"Sweethearts, Silenced\\" (Season 1, Episode 4) about the murders of Tim Hack and Kelly Drew. On January 15, 2018, Investigation Discovery broadcast a documentary called People Magazine Investigates ‚Äî My Father, the Serial Killer which tells the story of how Edwards' daughter realized her father had committed the so-called \\"Sweetheart Murders\\" and tipped off authorities, leading to his arrest and conviction.\\"Investigation Discovery, People Magazine Investigates - My Father the Serial Killer\\" The daughter told People that Edwards had a dark side, verbally and physically abusing her mother Kay, and making the children watch videos about the Zodiac Killer while screaming, ‚Äúthat's not how it happened!‚Äù When asked by Wayne Edwards \\"Do you think your Dad was the Zodiac Killer?\\" she replied, \\"I do\\". https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=445464999271515 she replied In April 2018, A&E; aired a six part series, It Was Him: The Many Murders of Ed Edwards. According to an article in Rolling Stone by Amelia Mcdonell-Parry, Larry Harnish, who has also researched the Black Dahlia case, ridiculed Cameron's use of a website which Cameron believes was authored by Edwards; Cameron's efforts to reach out to Kathleen Zellner, attorney for Steven Avery, were unsuccessful, but in an email Zellner doubted that Edwards could have murdered Teresa Halbach, while citing no evidence which definitively excluded him; Mcdonell-Parry claimed that Cameron embellished his theories in the A&E; documentary, citing a lack of evidence that the Zodiac Killer's hood was made of leather, but also noted that Detective Chad Garcia agreed that Edwards had committed more than the five murders for which he was convicted. In July 2019, Pineapple Street Media, in association with Gimlet Media, launched a podcast called The Clearing about Edward Wayne Edwards. The podcast story starts with the moment Edwards' daughter April Balascio realises her father might be involved in the \\"Sweetheart Murders\\" and includes what came after, as well as delves into Edwards' past by way of Balascio's memories.

In March, Super √âtendards and six Mirage 2000 aircraft carried out airstrikes against targets claimed to be al Qaeda. A few targets suggested by US forces were denied out of fear of hitting civilians. Nevertheless, French involvement was complimented on 11 March 2002 by US President George W.

Henze, Layers of Time (New York, 2000), p. 62 n. 49 According to a tradition recorded by Justin de Jacobis, the monastery was built on a crater where a dragon named Gabella dwelled, which was appeased with the periodic sacrifice of young women until the monks' prayers tamed it.Letter to M. de Spaccapietra, in A. Devlin, Abyssinia and its Apostle, translated by Mary Elizabeth, Lady Herbert (London, 1867), pp. 77f The remoteness of the monastery attracted other groups at odds with the mainstream Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. One of these dissidents were the Stephanites, who were accused of failing to venerate the cross and the Virgin Mary; Gebre Masih, abbot between 1475/1476 until his death around 1520, was one Stephanite, while another was Ezra, a monk belonging to Gunda Gunde.Steven Kaplan, \\"The F√§lasha and the Stephanite: An Episode from 'G√§dl√§ G√§br√§ M√§sih'\\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 48 (1985), pp. 278-282 Its remoteness also saved Gunda Gunde from the 16th century ravages of the Muslim assault by the forces of Imam Ahmad Gragn, which had plundered or destroyed many churches and other centers of Ethiopian Christianity. When Mgr. de Jacobis visited Gunda Gunde in the 1840s, the internal disorder of the Ethiopian Church had made it receptive to his missionary work: several monks converted to Catholicism, and its abbot Walda Giyorgis (died 1850) was openly pro-Catholic. The community's support led to the establishment of the first modern Catholic parish at Gwala, one of the fiefs of the monastery. The monastery's support of Catholicism came to an end with Walda Giyorgis' death and the election of a new abbot.Donald Crummey, Priests and Politicians (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2007), p. 77 The next notable European visit was by the Italian scholar, Antonio Mordini, who visited the monastery more than once in 1940. However, he did not publish an account of his visit until 1954.Mordini, \\"Il Convento di Gunda Gundie\\", Rassegna di Studi Etiopici, 12 (1954), pp. 29-48 Several years later Beatrice Playne, excited at the prospect of finding a religious site that had avoided Ahmad Gragn's attention, visited the monastery in 1948. After travelling for two days across several roadless mountain ranges, she found Gunda Gunde in a narrow valley with \\"cultivated gardens on either bank... irrigated by a careful system of wooden, trough-like pipes and primitive aqueducts\\". Unable to enter the compound due to her gender (Ethiopian tradition forbids women from entering monastery grounds), she had to be content with having the monks bring out selections of ancient manuscripts from its library and paintings from its church.Playne, Saint George for Ethiopia (London: Constable, 1954, pp. 86-92 Just as its remoteness had discouraged Imam Ahmad from visiting, so the Derg likewise failed to impose their authority on this distant corner of Ethiopia -- although the Tigray People's Liberation Front reportedly held a field conference at Gunda Gunde in the late 1980s.Paul B. Henze, \\"A visit to Gunda Gunde (Irob) - February 1998\\" , based on a presentation to the annual Orbis Aethiopicus conference in Cologne 11 October 1998  Compound  The buildings of Gunda Gunde include a numerous buildings intended to house the establishment's monks, built \\"of flat stones without mortar with roofs held up by huge logs darkened by the smoke and wear of centuries\\". In the middle stands a large, rectangular church which Henze speculated dated to the foundation of the monastery. Mordini measured the walls of the church, and reported its facade was 13.48 meters wide, the length of its left and right outer walls as 18.7 and 17.65 meters respectively, and rear wall as 14.9 meters wide. Henze describes its outer walls as consisting \\"of neatly laid flat tannish stone which has a bit of clay as mortar. They do not give the impression of ever having been rigidly regular. At several places there has been a moderate degree of subsidence which has caused cracks, never very wide, and there is occasional evidence of repairs. Between the outer and inner walls there is a passage about 1-1/2 m. wide.\\" He was unable to determine whether this passage extends completely around the inner square structure of the church. Following Ruth Playne's visit, a church dedicated to Saint Tekle Haymanot was erected outside the monastery for the convenience of women who had come to the monastery to observe religious holidays. Henze was told it had been endowed by Emperor Haile Selassie. Another important monastic building is the eqabet or treasury, which Henze describes as a small, rectangular building built in the 20th century with mortared walls and a tin roof. This building contains the monastic library.  Library  When de Jacobis was shown the monastic library at Gunda Gunde, he was told it held \\"the largest known collection of Abyssinian works.\\"Letter to M. de Spaccapietra, in Devlin, Abyssinia, p. 79 Although the collection of the monastic library remains an important collection, larger ones have been created since then.

He was a lieutenant de vaisseau on board the G√©ographe, a vessel whose officers also included an ensign (aspirant) called Charles Baudin. Fran√ßois-Andr√© Baudin fell ill and was left behind on √Æle de France in April 1801.Voyage de d√©couvertes aux terres australes, Fran√ßois P√©ron. Under the First French Empire, Fran√ßois-Andr√© Baudin rose to capitaine de vaisseau, commanding a force made up of the frigate Topaze (his flagship), the corvettes D√©partement- des-Landes (captained by Desmontils) and Torche (captained by Dehen) and the brig Faune (captained by Brunet). Cruising off Barbados, this force captured the British frigate Blanche, though Faune and Torche were later captured by the ship of the line , the frigate and . Topaze was also involved in the action with the Raisonnable and managed to escape to the Tagus. In November 1809 Baudin was ordered to take the 80-gun ships of the line Robuste and Bor√©e, the 74-gun Lion and the frigates Pauline and Pomone and escort a twenty ship convoy from Toulon to Barcelona to supply the Napoleonic forces fighting the Peninsular War. This French force was met by a hugely superior British squadron under George Martin. Seeing that the enemy had gained speed and was trying to block his path, Baudin ordered his ships to make for land as fast as possible, but this only led to the Robuste and Lion going aground - to deny them to the British, Baudin ordered them set on fire and scuttled near Frontignan. Captain Sen√®z, commanding the Bor√©e, stayed further offshore whilst still obeying Boudin's orders - he passed through the middle of the British squadron and escaped into the port of S√®te, normally too small for ships of the line.

History The present church dates from the 12th or the 13th century, and it is considered to be the oldest standing building in Brent. However an earlier church had been on the site, possibly from the Saxon period. By about 1244‚Äì48 the church had been appropriated to the hospital of St John of Jerusalem. In 1393 it had a dual dedication to Saint Andrew and Saint John the Baptist. Additions and alterations were made to the church in the 14th and 15th centuries. However, by 1796 it was in a dilapidated state. In 1840 it had a major restoration; the south porch, the roof bosses and the rood screen were removed. The exterior was covered in roughcast, a gallery was added and a brick vestry was built. The bellcote was rebuilt in 1870, and another restoration took place in 1888 when the vestry was removed, and a new vestry built on the north side of the church. In 1906 the roof was re-tiled, and there was a further restoration in 1955. In 1884 a new church had been built in the parish, dedicated to the Holy Innocents, and St Andrew's became its chapel of ease. By the late 1920s, due to an increase in the size of the local population, the Holy Innocents church was too small. In 1933 a new church, also dedicated to Saint Andrew, was erected on a site close to the old church. This church had originated in 1847 in Wells Street in the Marylebone area of London. It was dismantled, transported and rebuilt in Kingsbury. The old church was declared redundant on 1 April 1977, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 7 October 2010. =Lease to the Romanian Orthodox Church= In 2008 the Church of England gave permission for Old St Andrew's Church to be used as a place of worship for north-west London's growing Romanian community. In 2012 the Romanian Orthodox Church was given a twenty- year lease for use of the church as a place of worship. Architecture St Andrew's is constructed in rendered flint rubble, and contains some Roman bricks and tiles. It has a simple plan, consisting of a nave and a chancel in a single cell, a north vestry, and a turret at the west end surmounted by a spire. The font probably dates from the 13th century, and consists of a circular bowl with an octagonal rim, standing on a modern pedestal. The oak lectern dates from the 17th century; it was used by W. E. Gladstone when he visited the church and read the lesson. Also in the church are three brasses, the oldest dated 1520. There are three bells, dating from about 1350, from 1604, and from 1708. External features In the churchyard are six structures, each of which has been listed at Grade II. Four of these are tombstones: these are to Timothy Wetherilt, who died in 1741, to Henry Wetherilt, who died in the same year, to Thomas Raworth, who died in 1744, and to Edwin Austin Abbey, an American painter, who died in 1911. The other structures are a monument to William Frederick Ashton, who died in 1802, and the chest tomb of Joseph Finch, who died in 1776.

United States, 312 U.S. 19 (1941), was a United States Supreme Court case. It involved the Espionage Act of 1917 and its use against Mihail Gorin, an intelligence agent from the Soviet Union, and Hafis Salich, a United States Navy employee who sold to Gorin information on Japanese activity in the U.S.  Background  Hafis Salich was a Georgian immigrant who had worked in the Berkeley Police Department and knew some Japanese. In 1936, he became a civilian employee of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) working in ONI's branch office in San Pedro, California. Mihail Gorin came to the US in 1936, and operated the Los Angeles office of the Soviet tourist agency Intourist. He was also an intelligence agent of the Soviet Union. Gorin met Salich in 1937. Salich had access to ONI's files on pro-Japan activities among Japanese- Americans and the covert activities of Japanese consular officials. He was also short of money because of gambling losses. By 1938, Gorin persuaded Salich to sell him classified information from ONI covering US monitoring of Japanese officials and also private persons (Japanese-American citizens and resident aliens). Salich agreed by justifying his action on the theory that Japan was a 'common enemy' of the Soviet Union and the United States. Gorin and Salich were caught in late 1938, when Gorin left a spy note and cash in clothes sent for dry cleaning. The dry cleaners checked the pockets of all clothes before cleaning and found the money and note. They immediately contacted police, who contacted Ralph Van Deman, a former head of Army intelligence. Van Deman in turn informed the FBI, which investigated Salich and Gorin and obtained a confession from Salich.  Indictment and prosecution  In January 1939, Gorin and his wife, Natasha, as well as Salich, were indicted under the Espionage Act of 1917. The Act was then under Title 50 of the US Code. There were three counts against each defendant: *Count One: USC 50 ¬ß31 Copying, taking, making and obtaining documents, writings and notes of matters connected with the national defense (¬ß1 of the Act). *Count Two: USC 50 ¬ß32 Communicating, delivering and transmitting to Gorin as a representative of the Soviet Union writings, notes, instruments and information relating to the national defense (¬ß2 of the Act). *Count Three: USC 50 ¬ß34 Conspiring to communicate, deliver, transmit, and attempt to communicate, deliver and transmit to the Soviet Union and to a representative thereof, documents, writings, plans, notes, instruments and information relating to the national defense (¬ß4 of the Act). All defendants pleaded not guilty. The defense had several main arguments: *The Espionage Act of 1917 was too vague in its description of what information was considered illegal and so violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and \\"the right... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\\" provided in the Sixth Amendment. *The \\"innocuous\\" nature of the documents meant there was no intent to harm the US or to aid a foreign nation. *The information trafficked in by the defendant was not related to the national defense. *Courts, not juries, should decide whether information is \\"connected or related\\" to national defense *Some of the information was later published in a periodical and so not secret. The jury rejected the arguments and convicted Gorin and Salich on all three counts. Gorin got six years and Salich got four years. The Court instructed the jury to find Natasha not guilty of the first two counts, and the jury also found her not guilty of the third count. The case was appealed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in April 1940. The case was heard by Judges Garrecht, Haney, and Healy, who rejected all of defense counsel's arguments. The case then went to the Supreme Court. It was argued in December 1940 and decided in January 1941. The Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeals and rejected all of defense counsel's arguments.  Legal principles considered Several important legal principles involving the Espionage Act were discussed in Justice Stanley Forman Reed's opinion for the Court: *The act covers \\"obtaining\\" as well as \\"delivery\\" of information. *The act covers information \\"connected or related\\" to national defense, not only specific items listed (ships, aircraft, forts, etc.). *The definition of \\"national defense'\\" is that of the Defense Secrets Act of 1911, \\"a generic concept of broad connotations, referring to the military and naval establishments and the related activities of national preparedness.\\" *The jury, not the court, is to decide whether or not information was \\"connected or related\\" to national defense. *The vagueness and uncertainty of the law does not violate the Fifth or Sixth Amendments. *Sections 1(b) and 2 require \\"bad faith\\" (scienter). The defendant must have \\"intent or reason to believe that the information to be obtained is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation.\\" *Congress meant any foreign nation: \\"No distinction is made between friend or enemy.\\" *If there is no \\"occasion for secrecy\\" as with public Congressional reports, there can be no \\"reasonable intent to give advantage to a foreign government.\\" Gorin was cited in the 1971 case New York Times v. United States. The government also used Gorin in its arguments in the case of Stephen Jin-Woo Kim in 2010.

Paveliƒá was born in Zagreb as the son of politician and dentist Ante Paveliƒá and experienced his only international swimming tournament at the 1924 Games in Paris, where he failed to advance beyond the first round of the men's 200 metre breaststroke event. He did, however, travel internationally with the Yugoslav national tennis and football teams (winning five caps 1927-30) and won the 1930 Yugoslav Football Championship with H≈†K Concordia. He eventually graduated from the University of Zagreb with a law degree and opened a private practice in the city after two years of work in the courts. Fluent in five languages, he built an international client base prior to World War II, eventually moving to Switzerland in 1943 during the conflict. While in the country, he competed actively in skiing. Paveliƒá moved to New York City in 1946 and married his Swiss lover Irene Gmur. Soon after he founded Pavimpex Co., an import/export business focusing on lead and copper, with his brother. He moved to Greenwich, Connecticut in 1951 and continued his business, with an emphasis on specialty gifts from Italy and Austria. He retired in 1975 and his wife died in December 1984.

Murphy was later tried and convicted of rape and attempted murder. He was released on 12 August 2010 after serving only ten years.

Even though a life sentence was available to the court and would mean Murphy could be held in custody indefinitely, Judge Carney sentenced Murphy to only fifteen years (taking into account Murphy's guilty plea which spared his victim having to testify in court and highlighting the fact that sentences by him had been overturned by the Criminal Court of Appeal) and he served just ten. Murphy was sentenced before the Sex Offenders Act was introduced in 2001 so he is not subject to a post-release supervision order. Suspect Although only convicted of this crime, Murphy is regarded as being the prime suspect in the disappearance of a number of young women in the mid to late 1990s in the Leinster area, when he was known to be living in the region. These women have become known in popular parlance having disappeared within \\"Ireland's Vanishing Triangle\\". The list of vanished women include: # Annie McCarrick, 26 (1993) # Eva Brennan, 39 (1993) # Imelda Keenan, 22 (1994) # Jo-Jo Dullard, 21 (1995) # Fiona Pender, 25 (1996) # Ciara Breen, 17 (1997) # Fiona Sinnott, 19 (1998) # Deirdre Jacob, 18 (1998) No other such disappearances occurred while Murphy was in prison. In particular Murphy has been suspected of being responsible for the disappearances of Annie McCarrick, Jo-Jo Dullard and Deirdre Jacob, all of whom vanished close to the area where Murphy lived at the time. The bodies of these individuals have never been found despite massive searches and investigations for over 10 years. Despite intensive questioning by Garda√≠ (Irish police), Murphy denies any knowledge or involvement in the disappearance of these women. Murphy has been ruled out of as a suspect in the Dullard investigation. Release from prison There was widespread opposition upon Murphy's early release, and the residents of his home town, Baltinglass, announced that he would not be welcome in the village. After he was released he was considered a high risk offender and was visited by a member of the Garda√≠ every month.\\"Notorious rapist Larry Murphy released from prison\\". Independent.ie (12 August 2010). Retrieved 22 November 2012. It was known that Murphy had fled the country and taken up residence in the south of Spain, where he was under surveillance by police. Shortly afterwards he moved to Amsterdam. During his time there witnesses, hitherto unaware of his past, reported that he frequented several bars but was quiet and kept to himself. He drank and smoked cannabis regularly and at times approached and attempted to strike up conversation with young women. In time the media became aware of his location and under increased scrutiny from Dutch police, Murphy fled to Spain through France.Jim Cusack (7 August 2011). \\"Rapist Murphy visited Amsterdam's red-light district\\".

Living in the south of Spain, in late May 2011, Murphy's wallet and passport were allegedly stolen while engaging the services of a prostitute. This led him to consult the Spanish authorities in a bid to travel back to Ireland to obtain a new passport. As a result of his background becoming known, there was much dissention among the local population regarding his presence there. Two weeks later, after his new documents were in order, he returned to southern Spain. In November 2012 he was photographed by journalists in Amsterdam, where he was found living with a friend, a convicted double rapist. This was aired on a 60-minute exclusive episode of TV3's prime-time Midweek TV program.YouTube In January 2013, there were some local rumours (quickly spread on social media) that he had been seen in Saggart, Co. Dublin, but this was quickly denied by crime journalist Paul Williams, who stated that he was then living in Amsterdam. In June 2014, it was reported that he was living in South London under an alias, working as a carpenter. Alleged \\"sightings\\" and hysteria In the period after Murphy's release, there developed what sometimes approached mass hysteria surrounding the whereabouts of Murphy. This was usually, in part, driven by rumours initiated via social networking sites that Larry Murphy was living in or visiting a particular town or locality.\\"Tullamore in panicked frenzy with false Larry Murphy sightings\\".

The forest is characterized by a relatively flat landscape with alluvial plains dissected by undulating hills or high terraces. The biota of the southwest Amazon moist forest is very rich because of these dramatic edaphic and topographical variations at both the local and regional levels. This ecoregion has the highest number of both mammals and birds recorded for the Amazonian biogeographic realm: 257 with 11 endemic species for mammals and 782 and 17 endemics for birds. The inaccessibility of this region, along with few roads, has kept most of the habitat intact. Also, there are a number of protected areas, which preserve this extremely biologically rich ecoregion.  Location  Mauritia flexuosa, or moriche palm, is an economically important species dominant in some parts of the ecoregion. The southwest Amazon moist forest region covers an extensive area of the Upper Amazon Basin comprising four sub-basins: (1) both the Pastaza-Mara√±on and (2) Ucayali River sub-basins drain into the Upper Amazon River in Peru; (3) the Acre and (4) Madre de Dios- Beni sub-basins drain to the east into the Juru√°, Purus and Madeira Rivers; which, in turn, feed into the Amazon River lower down in Brazil. The region is bisected north to south between Peru and Brazil by the small mountain range Serra do Divisor. It extends east to the edge of the Purus Arch, or ancient zone of uplift, in the southwestern area of the Brazilian State of Amazonas. It then extends southeast into northern Bolivia and in a narrow band south along the base of the Andes Mountains. Elevations range from in the west to on the eastern edge of the region. Landforms present in this region include the upland terra firme (non-flooded) mostly on nutrient-poor lateritic soils, ancient alluvial plains (mostly non-flooded) on nutrient-rich soils, and present alluvial plains (v√°rzea, seasonally flooded) of super-rich sediments renewed with each annual flood. Floristically, distinct lowland humid forest types occur on each of these landforms with the terra firme mature forests and late successional, seasonally flooded forest being the two major types. Permanent swamp forests are common on the alluvial plains. Pockets of nutrient-poor white sand soils are found here that host forests of lower height, a more open forest canopy, and lower alpha diversity, but with many endemics. The forests are mostly dense tropical rain forest, but some patches of open forest exist. The ecoregion contains stretches of Iquitos v√°rzea along the main rivers, blending into Purus v√°rzea near the eastern border, where it adjoins the Juru√°-Purus moist forests ecoregion. In the southeast it adjoins the Purus-Madeira moist forests and Madeira-Tapaj√≥s moist forests, and in the south merges into the Llanos de Moxos and Bolivian Yungas. In the southwest it adjoins the Peruvian Yungas. To the west it adjoins the Ucayali moist forests. In the north it is separated by a band of Iquitos varzea from the Solim√µes- Japur√° moist forests. General description of flora Because the ecoregion covers such a vast area, there are climatic, edaphic and floristic differences within it. Generally, the wetter and less seasonal northern forests ( of rain annually) share only 44 percent of the tree species with forests in the slightly drier, more seasonal southern region. This region receives from of rain annually, in different parts. Temperatures over the year range from . At first glance, large areas may appear to be homogeneous dense forests with a canopy high with some emergent trees to towering above the canopy. Structurally, this may be the case; however, the species composition reflects much the opposite: tree species variability reaches upwards to 300 species in a single hectare. There are a few exceptions to this high diversity, mainly where stands dominated by one or several species occur. The first are vast areas (more than ) dominated by the highly competitive arborescent bamboos Guadua sarcocarpa and Guadua weberbaueri near Acre, Brazil extending into Peru and Bolivia. Other monodominant stands include swamp forests of the economically important palms Mauritia flexuosa and Jessenia bataua. In the north of the region, some of the best known plants yield products of commercial value, such as rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), balsam wood (Myroxylon balsamum), timber and essential oil (Amburana acreana), tagua nut (Phytelephas microcarpa), and strychnine (Strychnos asperula). An area representative of the southern part of this region, in the north of Bolivia, hosts a seasonal humid high forest to with some emergents reaching in height and many buttressed trunks. The largest trees are Ceiba pentandra, Poulsenia armata, Calycophyllum spruceanum, Swietenia macrophylla, and Dipteryx odorata. Other trees typical in this area are Calycophyllum acreanum, Terminalia amazonica, Combretum laxum, Mezilaurus itauba, Didymopanax morototoni, Jacaranda copaia, Aspidosperma megalocarpon, Vochisia vismiaefolia, Hirtella lightioides, and Hura crepitans. Palms include, among others, members of the genera Astrocaryum, Iriartea and Sheelea, Oenocarpus mapora, Chelyocarpus chuco, Phytelephas macrocarpa, Euterpe precatoria, and Jessenia bataua. Lianas are common with about 43 species present. Many Amazonian species reach the southern limit of their distribution here. The Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) is present in the south, but is likely not native this far west in Amazonia. Biodiversity features Leopardus pardalis, the ocelot, is a threatened species that finds a home in the southwest Amazon moist forests. What is distinctive about this region is the diversity of habitats created by edaphic, topographic and climatic variability. Habitat heterogeneity, along with a complex geological and climatic history has led to a high cumulative biotic richness. Endemism and overall richness is high in vascular plants, invertebrates and vertebrate animals. This is the Amazon Basin's center of diversity for palms. The rare palm Itaya amicorum is found on the upper Javari River. This ecoregion has the highest number of mammals recorded for the Amazonian biogeographic realm: 257 with 11 endemics. Bird richness is also highest here with 782 species and 17 endemics. In the southern part of the Tambopata Reserve, one area that is holds the record for bird species: 554. On the white sand areas in the north, plants endemic to this soil type include Jacqueshuberia loretensis, Ambelania occidentalis, Spathelia terminalioides, and Hirtella revillae. Many widespread Amazonian mammals and reptiles find a home in this region. These include tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), jaguars (Panthera onca), the world's largest living rodents, capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), kinkajous (Potos flavus), and white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari). Some of the globally threatened animals found in this region include black caimans (Melanosuchus niger) and spectacled caimans (Caiman crocodilus crocodilus), woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha), giant otters (Pteronura brasiliensis), giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), and ocelots (Leopardus pardalis). Pygmy marmosets (Cebuella pygmaea), Goeldi marmosets (Callimico goeldii), pacaranas (Dinomys branickii), and eastern lowland olingos (Bassaricyon alleni) are found here, but not in regions to the east. Other primates present include tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis and Saguinus imperator), brown pale-fronted capuchins (Cebus albifrons), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), white-faced sakis (Pithecia irrorata), and black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus). The rare red uakari monkeys (Cacajao calvus) are found in the north in swamp forests. Nocturnal two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni) are well distributed throughout this region along with the widespread three-toes sloths (Bradypus variegatus). The Amazon River is a barrier to a number of animals such as the tamarins Saguinus nigricollis, which occur on the north side, and Saguinus mystax, which occurs on the southwest side of the Amazon-Ucayali system. In the region of Manu, 68 species of reptiles and 68 species of amphibians have been reported for the lowland areas while 113 species of amphibians and 118 species of reptiles are reported from Madre de Dios, including the rare and interesting pit-vipers (Bothrops bilineatus, Bothrops brazili), and frogs such as Dendrophidion sp., Rhadinaea occipitalis, and Xenopholis scalaris. Current status The riverbank of Man√∫ National Park. Much of the natural habitat of the region remains intact, protected by sheer inaccessibility. People have dwelled along the major rivers for millennia and have subtly altered the forests on a small scale, but around the urban centers development proceeds. Very few roads exist in the region, limiting development. Intense deforestation is constrained to the few roads that do exist or around urban centers such as Iquitos, Puerto Maldonado, and Rio Branco. Man√∫ National Park, a World Heritage Site, protects of pristine lowland forest in southern Peru, a large part of which falls into this ecoregion. The nearby Tambopata-Candamo reserve protects seven major forest types. This reserve offers refuge to game species that have been over-hunted in other areas such as tapirs, spider monkeys, jaguars, capybaras, white-lipped peccaries, monkeys, caimans and river turtles. The Manuripi-Heath Amazonian Wildlife National Reserve is located in the southernmost area of this region in Bolivia covering of dense tropical forest. Several extractive reserves, the largest being Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve and Alto Juru√° Extractive Reserve, are actively managed in Brazil. Other protected areas include national parks (Serra do Divisor National Park, Madidi National Park, Isoboro Secure National Park, Bahuaja- Sonene National Park), national forests, Rio Acre Ecological Station, Antimari State Forest, Apurimac Reserve Zone, among others. Most protected areas suffer from insufficient administration and patrol. Types and severity of threats invasive Guadua bamboo is threatening the natural ecodiversity of the region. Hunting may be threatening populations of the tapir (Tapirus terrestris) and large primates in the north. Some habitat is threatened by expansion of the agricultural and pastoral frontier, gold mining, and selective logging that erodes the genetic diversity of a few valuable timber species. The economically important palm Euterpe precatoria is being depleted in some areas by unsustainable palm heart extraction. A dramatic problem that exists in the Brazilian State of Acre and in the adjacent area of Peru is the spread of the invasive Guadua bamboo forests. This highly competitive bamboo invades and dominates abandoned clearings and threatens to dominate the disturbed areas in this region. Logging along major rivers and near urban centers has decimated populations of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), tropical cedar (Cedrela odorata), and kapok (Ceiba pentandra). During the period from 2004 to 2011 the ecoregion experienced an annual rate of habitat loss of 0.17%. References Sources Further reading *Daly, D. C., and J. D.

It was disapproved by the House of Lords in Murphy v Brentwood DC and is now bad law[1991] UKHL 2, [1991] 1 AC 398 except in Canada and New Zealand.[2012] , [2012] Facts Mrs Dutton sought to recover damages from a builder, Bognor Regis Building Co Ltd, and the local council, Bognor Regis Urban District Council, that certified her house was sound, when it emerged that her house's foundations were defective because it had been built on a rubbish tip. This would have been discoverable if proper checks had been made. Mrs Dutton had bought the building from a Mr Clark, who in turn had bought the building from the builder, so that Mrs Dutton had no direct contract with either the builder or the council. She settled the claim with the builder for ¬£625 after getting advice that an action in negligence could not succeed, but continued in an action against the council, and Cusack J awarded damages ¬£2,115. The council appealed. Judgment The Court of Appeal held that Mrs Dutton could recover money from the council, as an extension of the principle in Donoghue v Stevenson. It was fair and reasonable that the council should be liable to a later purchaser of a house that its surveyor had negligently certified to be sound. Lord Denning MR's judgment went as follows. Critique Denning essentially argues (not unlike noblesse oblige) that if an inspector has a statutory right to inspect the property under construction, he thereby acquires a duty of care to inspect carefully. That is to say: a person who has a right has duties attached to that right. But jurists Mickey Dias and Hohfeld have shown that rights and duties are jural correlatives.Dias - \\"Jurisprudence\\" That is to say: if someone has a right, someone else owes a duty to them. So here, the inspector has a right (to inspect), and the builder has a duty to let them inspect. The later Murphy v Brentwood DC case revealed Denning's reasoning in Dutton to be flawed.

He was an exponent of empirio-criticism. He was also known as Nikolai Valentinov-Volski and, later, as E. Yurevski. Biography =Early years= Nikolai Vladislavovich Volski was born in Morshansk, in the Tambov Governorate of the Russian empire, in 1879. His family was of Lithuanian origin. As a student at the St. Petersburg Technological Institute, Volski became involved in the revolutionary movement. At first he sympathised with the Narodniki (populists) and became affiliated with some of the early Socialist-Revolutionary circles. Later he discovered Marxism and became involved in the Social-Democratic party. In 1898, Volski was arrested and banished to Ufa. In 1900, after his release, he moved to Kiev, where he attended the Polytechnic and resumed his revolutionary activities. He also met his future wife Valentina there; in her honour he came to use the pseudonym 'Nikolai Valentinov'. During these years, Valentinov-Volski undertook a thorough study of Marxism, reading Karl Marx' magnum opus Capital and writings by Georgi Plekhanov and V.I. Lenin. He also took an interest in contemporary philosophy of science, especially in the empirio-criticism and empirio-monist theories of Ernst Mach and Richard Avenarius. =Bolshevik activist= Valentinov played an active part in the student revolutionary movement and was arrested several times. In 1902, he received a serious head wound, which almost killed him, during a demonstration. In 1903, after his release from yet another term of imprisonment, he went into exile to Switzerland. In Geneva, he associated with Lenin. Under Lenin's influence, Valentinov joined the Bolshevik wing of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP) after the party's split at its second congress in 1903. Valentinov later recounted his time with Lenin in his 1953 book entitled My Encounters with Lenin. Valentinov had been attracted to Lenin because of the latter's pamphlet What Is To Be Done? (1902), whose vision of a conspiratorial vanguard party appealed to the former sympathizer of Narodnaya Volya. However, Valentinov soon came into conflict with Lenin, particularly with respect to philosophical issues. Valentinov set out to combine Marxism with the empirio-criticism philosophy of Mach and Avenarius. He was not unique in this; Machism was a popular current in the Russian, German and Austrian socialist movements of the period: The Russian Bolsheviks Alexander Bogdanov and Anatoli Lunacharski, the Socialist-Revolutionaries Viktor Chernov and Nikolai Avksentiev and the Austro-Marxist Friedrich Adler were Russian machists strongly influenced by empirio-criticism. Valentinov claimed Lenin was not so much an orthodox Marxist as a materialist influenced by Nikolay Chernyshevsky. This, Valentinov maintained, was behind Lenin's utter rejection empirio-criticism as a form of subjective idealism. Valentinov objected to this critique, since in his view empirio-criticism was designed to overcome the metaphysical dichotomy of idealism and realism.The basic idea of empirio-criticism was that the question whether objects are constituted by the mind in some way (idealism) or exist independently of any mind (realism) is a piece of unverifiable and therefore meaningless metaphysics; what objects are is determined by empirical science, and science relies on sense data whose ontological status is undetermined or 'neutral'. For Lenin, the dispute had not merely philosophical but political implications: empirio-criticism was a form of petty bourgeois ideology that not only threatened the philosophical purity of Marxism but would also, in time, reveal its objectively counterrevolutionary political consequences. Valentinov considered Lenin's position dogmatic, unscientific and based on an inadequate understanding of philosophy. Relations soon deteriorated. In 1905, Valentinov returned illegally to Russia and defected to the Menshevik faction of the RSDRP. Valentinov had laid out his philosophy in the book Ernst Mach and Marxism (1907). Lenin wrote a long polemic, Materialism and Empirio- criticism (1908), against what he considered the baleful influence of empirio- criticism on the revolutionary movement. Valentinov, along with Bogdanov and Lunacharski, was one of his targets. Valentinov countered with the book The Philosophical Conceptions of Marxism (1908). In this work he rejected the charge of idealism and, in his various philosophical writings, went out of his way to criticise former Marxists like Sergei Bulgakov and Petr Struve, who had embraced idealist philosophies. =Post-Bolshevik activities= During the abortive Revolution of 1905, Valentinov worked for the Ukrainian Menshevik party in various capacities but played a minor role in the political events of the day. He concentrated primarily on journalism, contributing to such papers as Russkoe Slovo (Russian Word) and Kievskaya Mysl (where Leon Trotsky was one of his colleagues). Valentinov published his articles under various pseudonyms. He adopted a moderate Internationalist position during the First World War. He welcomed the Revolution of 1917 but gradually grew disillusioned with Kerenski's provisional government and the Menshevik/SR leaders of the soviets. After the October Revolution, Valentinov left the Menshevik party. He was appointed as a 'non-party specialist' to the Supreme Economic Council of Soviet Russia (Vesenkha), and was one of the architects of the New Economic Policy (NEP) after the Russian Civil War. He also founded the journal Torgovo- Promyshlennaya Gazeta (Commercial-Industrial Gazette). During those years he collaborated closely with Nikolai Bukharin. After Lenin's death in 1924, Valentinov found his position in Soviet Russia increasingly precarious. He watched the rise of Joseph Stalin with alarm and firmly opposed moves to abandon the NEP in favour of a programme of rapid industrialisation and collectivisation of agriculture.During this period, Valentinov also opposed Trotsky, who called for an end to the NEP. As one of the most ardent defenders of the NEP, Valentinov felt that his life was in danger when Stalin decided definitively to abandon the NEP. In 1928, he fled from the Soviet Union and settled in Paris. He contributed to various √©migr√© journals, now generally using the pseudonym 'E. Yurevski', and reconnected with the Menshevik exiles. Valentinov survived the Second World War in Paris. Valentinov was frequently consulted by scholars (e.g., Leopold Haimson) on the early history of the Russian revolutionary movement and the Soviet Union. In the 1950s and '60s, Valentinov authored and edited various books on historical, philosophical, literary and economic subjects, including: My Encounters with Lenin (1953), Two Years with the Symbolists (1969), The Early Years of Lenin (1969) and The New Economic Policy and the Party Crisis after the Death of Lenin (1971). Several of these works appeared posthumously, as Nikolai Valentinov died in Paris on August 26, 1964. Footnotes Further reading * Valentinov, N., R. Magee and G.

Background Tuileagna was a member of the √ì Maolconaire Brehon family, but it has proved difficult for researchers to uncover more detail about him. His antagonist, Fearfeasa √ì Maol Chonaire, said in a poem that his father's name was Seanch√°n. He might be identified with the Tuileagna √ì Maol Chonaire who was a student at the University of Louvain in 1625, or a student at the Irish College at Salamanca in April 1610, who was aged about twenty-five. He is usually thought to have been the Tuileagna √ì Maol Chonaire recorded living in Madrid some years later. In March 1658, a man of that name authenticated a genealogical transcript, identifying himself as seancha coitcheann √âireann/general historian of Ireland. In September 1659, the same man transcribed a tract on grammar and prosody for Father Patrick Tyrrell, OFM, indicating that the man in Madrid had links with the Irish Franciscans, perhaps himself being a member of the order. A later Tuileagna √ì Maol Chonaire added a note to Laud Misc 610 in Oxford, 1673, but his identity is unknown. An earlier Tuileagna √ì Maoil Chonaire, was a poet alive about 1585. Dispute with the Four Masters In 1637, upon M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh's return to Louvain with the finished autograph of the Annals of the Four Masters, Tuileagna publicly expressed concerns on four points of detail in Genalogiae regum et sanctorum Hiberniae and the Four Masters text, stating that the points cast a slur on the status of Connacht. He furthermore stated that Conchobhar Mac Bruaideadha withdrew his approbation in public following a general chapter of the Franciscans in Thomond in 1638, while stating that Flan Mac Aodhag√°in had temporarily withdrawn his approbation in 1637 until the disputed points were resolved. Discussion of the matter continued after √ì Cl√©irigh's death in 1643, and in part led to the delay in publication of the work. Two of the Masters, C√∫ Choigcr√≠che √ì Cl√©irigh and Fearfeasa √ì Maol Chonaire, wrote responses in prose and verse to Tuileagna, though that of C√∫ Choigcr√≠che has not survived. Bernadette Cunningham has noted \\"That the Tuileagna √ì Maol Chonaire who criticized √ì Cl√©irigh's work was a Franciscan would have made it relatively easy for him to have the matter of the accuracy of AFM and associated texts raised at no less than three formal chapters of the order - at Thomond (1638), Multyfarnham (1641) and Dublin.\\" (p. 266) She furthermore states: (p. 266) Tuileagna did not offer to revise the text himself, instead proposing that the Reverend Brian Flann Mac Aodhag√°in and others assess it. Publication delay Tuileagna's views held enough influence within the Irish Franciscan community to delay publication. While manuscripts of the Annals circulated for generations, it was only in 1846 that a version translated into English was published by Owen Connellan, and only as far as 1171. John O'Donovan edited the six volumes that comprised the full text published in the 1850s.

Govindan, Ayyappa Panikkar, G. Aravindan, Kainikkara Kumara Pillai and G. Sankara Pillai were involved with the movement. \\"Thanathunatakavedi\\", the idea of having a theatre involving indigenous art forms of Kerala was first evolved from C.N.

Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), was a United States Supreme Court case in which a unanimous Court found that \\"the legacy of official discrimination ... acted in concert with the multimember districting scheme to impair the ability of ... cohesive groups of black voters to participate equally in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice.\\" The ruling invalidated districts of the North Carolina General Assembly and led to more single-member districts in state legislatures. Background =Legislative history= Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits any jurisdiction from implementing a \\"voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure ... in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right ... to vote on account of race,\\" color, or language minority status.Voting Rights Act of 1965 ¬ß 2; (formerly 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1973) The Supreme Court has allowed private plaintiffs to sue to enforce this prohibition. In City of Mobile v. Bolden (1980), the Supreme Court held that as originally enacted in 1965, Section 2 simply restated the Fifteenth Amendment and thus prohibited only those voting laws that were intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose.City of Mobile v. Bolden, Congress responded by passing an amendment to the Voting Rights Act which President Ronald Reagan signed into law on June 29, 1982. Congress's amended Section 2 to create a \\"results\\" test, which prohibits any voting law that has a discriminatory effect irrespective of whether the law was intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose. The 1982 amendments provided that the results test does not guarantee protected minorities a right to proportional representation. When determining whether a jurisdiction's election law violates this general prohibition, courts have relied on factors enumerated in the Senate Judiciary Committee report associated with the 1982 amendments (\\"Senate Factors\\"), including: # The history of official discrimination in the jurisdiction that affects the right to vote; # The degree to which voting in the jurisdiction is racially polarized; # The extent of the jurisdiction's use of majority vote requirements, unusually large electoral districts, prohibitions on bullet voting, and other devices that tend to enhance the opportunity for voting discrimination; # Whether minority candidates are denied access to the jurisdiction's candidate slating processes, if any; # The extent to which the jurisdiction's minorities are discriminated against in socioeconomic areas, such as education, employment, and health; # Whether overt or subtle racial appeals in campaigns exist; # The extent to which minority candidates have won elections; # The degree that elected officials are unresponsive to the concerns of the minority group; and # Whether the policy justification for the challenged law is tenuous. The report indicates not all or a majority of these factors need to exist for an electoral device to result in discrimination, and it also indicates that this list is not exhaustive, allowing courts to consider additional evidence at their discretion. Section 2 prohibits two types of discrimination: \\"vote denial\\", in which a person is denied the opportunity to cast a ballot or to have their vote properly counted, and \\"vote dilution\\", in which the strength or effectiveness of a person's vote is diminished. Most Section 2 litigation has concerned vote dilution, especially claims that a jurisdiction's redistricting plan or use of at-large/multimember elections prevents minority voters from casting sufficient votes to elect their preferred candidates. An at-large election can dilute the votes cast by minority voters by allowing a cohesive majority group to win every legislative seat in the jurisdiction. Redistricting plans can be gerrymandered to dilute votes cast by minorities by \\"packing\\" high numbers of minority voters into a small number of districts or \\"cracking\\" minority groups by placing small numbers of minority voters into a large number of districts. =Procedural history= In July 1981 the North Carolina General Assembly enacted a redistricting plan in response to the 1980 United States Census.Gingles v. Edmisten, 590 F.Supp. 345 (EDNC 1984). In September 1981 plaintiffs sued North Carolina Attorney General Rufus L. Edmisten, alleging their votes would be submerged by multimember districts in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Meanwhile, in June 1982 Congress amended the Voting Rights Act, extending Section 5 and substantially revising Section 2.Thomas M. Boyd & Stephen J. Markman, The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act: A Legislative History, 40 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 1347 (1983). In January 1984 a special three-judge district court in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina made up of Circuit Judge James Dickson Phillips, Chief District Judge William Earl Britt, and Senior District Judge Franklin Taylor Dupree Jr. agreed, finding that all the challenged districts violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and enjoined holding any elections under the General Assembly's redistricting plan. North Carolina Attorney General Lacy Thornburg directly appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. The case was argued on December 4, 1985 with Attorney General Thornburg appearing himself, and the Solicitor General of the United States Charles Fried also appearing, both arguing for reversal. Julius L. Chambers argued for the respondents.https://www.oyez.org/cases/1985/83-1968 Chambers was supported by co-cousels, Lani Guinier, and Leslie Winner. Opinion of the Court On June 30, 1986, the last day of the term, the Supreme Court announced its decision, alongside Davis v. Bandemer and Bowers v. Hardwick. The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed that there were Section 2 violations in all of the statehouse districts except the Durham County, North Carolina multimember district, which a majority reversed.Adam B. Cox and Thomas J. Miles, Judging the Voting Rights Act, 108 Columbia Law Review 1 (2008). In an opinion by Justice William J. Brennan joined partially by Justices Byron White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, and John Paul Stevens the Court used the term \\"vote dilution through submergence\\" to describe claims that a jurisdiction's use of an at-large/multimember election system or gerrymandered redistricting plan diluted minority votes, and it established a legal framework for assessing such claims under Section 2. Under the Gingles test, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions: # The racial or language minority group \\"sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district\\"; # The minority group is \\"politically cohesive\\" (meaning its members tend to vote similarly); and # The \\"majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it ... usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\\"Thornburg v. Gingles, The first precondition is known as the \\"compactness\\" requirement and concerns whether a majority-minority district can be created.Katz, Ellen D., co-author. \\"Documenting Discrimination in Voting: Judicial Findings Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act Since 1982.‚Äù M Aisenbrey et al., co-authors. U. Mich. J. L. Reform 39, no. 4 (2006): 643-772. The second and third preconditions are collectively known as the \\"racially polarized voting\\" or \\"racial bloc voting\\" requirement, and they concern whether the voting patterns of the different racial groups are different from each other. If a plaintiff proves these preconditions exist, then the plaintiff must additionally show, using the remaining Senate Factors and other evidence, that under the \\"totality of the circumstances\\", the jurisdiction's redistricting plan or use of at-large or multimember elections diminishes the ability of the minority group to elect candidates of its choice. =Plurality opinion= Justice Brennan goes on, in a section Justice White refused to join, to reject the Solicitor General's argument that a multiple regression analysis is needed to take into account the other socioeconomic factors that might influence voting patterns.John M. Powers, Statistical Evidence of Racially Polarized Voting in the Obama Elections, and Implications for Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 102 Georgetown Law Journal 881 (2014). According to the plurality, race is the determinant, not a mere corollary, of voter behavior. As illustration Justice Brennan notes that 47.8% of the black population of Halifax County, North Carolina lives in poverty, compared with only 12.6% of whites. Because race, and only race, is the relevant evidence of polarized voting, the four justices believed the lower court correctly relied only on an ecological regression and bivariate analysis. =Concurrence= Justice White wrote separately to note that he disagreed with Justice Brennan's view that only voters‚Äô race can be relevant evidence of polarized voting.Yut, Scott, Using Candidate Race to Define Minority-Preferred Candidates under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, University of Chicago Legal Forum: Vol. 1995: Iss. 1, Article 22. For Justice White the race of the candidates also mattered; it would not be racially polarized if white voters elected a black candidate not supported by black voters. Without Justice White's fifth vote Justice Brennan's section on the relevant evidence only carried the authority of a plurality opinion. =Concurrence in judgment= Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., and Justice William Rehnquist concurred in the judgment only. Justice O‚ÄôConnor, a former Arizona statehouse legislator, began by noting that Senator Bob Dole, ‚Äúthe architect of the compromise‚Äù, had insisted the 1982 amendment explicitly disclaim any right to racially proportional representation. Nevertheless, Justice O‚ÄôConnor sees the majority opinion as attempting to create a right to ‚Äúusual, roughly proportional representation‚Äù. Justice O‚ÄôConnor next agrees with Justice White that the plurality was wrong to insist the only relevant evidence is the race of the voters. She writes that the law does not permit ‚Äúan arbitrary rule against consideration of all evidence considering voting preferences‚Äù. =Concurrence in part and dissent in part= Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun, joined the Court in affirming the three judge district court but dissented from reversing the judgment regarding the Durham County multimember district. Justice Stevens wrote that although Durham County had elected a black candidate in every election since 1972, the multimember district still violates the Voting Rights Act considering ‚Äúthe political realities of the State‚Äù. Furthermore, Justice Stevens felt reversing without a remand was ‚Äúmystifying‚Äù and ‚Äúalso extremely unfair.‚Äù Subsequent developments Subsequent litigation further defined the contours of \\"vote dilution through submergence\\" claims. In Bartlett v. Strickland (2009),Bartlett v. Strickland, the Supreme Court held that the first Gingles precondition can be satisfied only if a district can be drawn in which the minority group comprises a majority of voting-age citizens. This means that plaintiffs cannot succeed on a submergence claim in jurisdictions where the size of the minority group, despite not being large enough to comprise a majority in a district, is large enough for its members to elect their preferred candidates with the help of \\"crossover\\" votes from some members of the majority group. In contrast, the Supreme Court has not addressed whether different protected minority groups can be aggregated to satisfy the Gingles preconditions as a coalition, and lower courts have split on the issue. The Supreme Court provided additional guidance on the \\"totality of the circumstances\\" test in Johnson v. De Grandy (1994). The Court emphasized that the existence of the three Gingles preconditions may be insufficient to prove liability for vote dilution through submergence if other factors weigh against such a determination, especially in lawsuits challenging redistricting plans. In particular, the Court held that even where the three Gingles preconditions are satisfied, a jurisdiction is unlikely to be liable for vote dilution if its redistricting plan contains a number of majority-minority districts that is proportional to the minority group's population. The decision thus clarified that Section 2 does not require jurisdictions to maximize the number of majority-minority districts. The opinion also distinguished the proportionality of majority-minority districts, which allows minorities to have a proportional opportunity to elect their candidates of choice, from the proportionality of election results, which Section 2 explicitly does not guarantee to minorities. An issue regarding the third Gingles precondition remains unresolved. In Gingles, the Supreme Court split as to whether plaintiffs must prove that the majority racial group votes as a bloc specifically because its members are motivated to vote based on racial considerations and not other considerations that may overlap with race, such as party affiliation. A plurality of justices said that requiring such proof would violate Congress's intent to make Section 2 a \\"results\\" test, but Justice White maintained that the proof was necessary to show that an electoral scheme results in racial discrimination. Since Gingles, lower courts have split on the issue. Statisticians have observed that the Court's approach is invalidated by the ecological fallacy.Wildgen, John K.. 1988, Adding Thornburg to the Thicket: The Ecological Fallacy and Parameter Control in Vote Dilution Case, 20 The Urban Lawyer 1. American Bar Association: 155‚Äì73. . Social scientists have found that federal judges vary widely when applying the Gingles preconditions. Three judge courts made up of all Democrat appointees have ruled in favor of Section 2 liability in 41% of cases, contrasted with 11% under the all Republican appointed panels. North Carolina would face continued redistricting woes after the 1990 United States Census. In Shaw v. Reno (1993) the Supreme Court 5-4 struck down North Carolina's attempt to create two majority minority districts. After hearing the case three more times, in Easley v. Cromartie (2001) the Supreme Court would 5-4 uphold the redistricting because the General Assembly's motivations had been purely political.Robinson O.

Moore had herself recorded \\"Lean on Me\\" in 1972, her rendition being featured on her concert album Melba Moore Live!. However the recruitment of McCoy to helm Moore's album was essentially due to McCoy's success as a producer of disco records, it being hoped that a disco hit would consolidate the somewhat nebulous success Moore had to that point experienced as a recording artist: (Melba Moore quote:)\\"I just couldn't ignore the [impact] that disco was having on music\\".Miami News 29 March \\"'Hair' is Here, Melba Moore is Sparkling\\" by Patricia Smith p.6C Reception The album's disco-oriented title track was released in March 1976 and became a discoth√®que favorite: while the \\"This Is It\\" single did afford Moore her first major R&B; hit, reaching #18 on the Billboard ranking of R&B; singles the track failed to provide her with the desired Pop music breakout, rising no higher than #91 on the Billboard Hot 100 (\\"This Is It\\" did become a Top Ten hit on the singles chart for the United Kingdom). \\"Lean on Me\\" was issued as followup single to afford Moore a second Top 20 R&B; hit peaking at #17.

He had previously tried to register to vote and had allegedly talked to federal officials after witnessing the 1961 murder of Herbert Lee, an NAACP member, by E. H. Hurst, a white state legislator. Civil rights activists had come to Liberty that summer to organize for voter registration, as no African-American had been allowed to vote since the state's disenfranchising constitution was passed in 1890. Allen was harassed and jailed repeatedly by Amite County Sheriff Daniel Jones. The day before he planned to move out of state, Allen was fatally shot on his own property. Since the late 20th century, his case has been investigated by Tulane University history professor Plater Robinson. The case was reopened by the FBI beginning in 2007 as part of its review of civil rights-era cold cases. In 2011 the CBS program 60 Minutes conducted a special on his murder as well. Their work suggested that Allen was killed by Jones. However, no one has been prosecuted for the murder. Early life Louis Allen was a native of Amite County, Mississippi, where he was born in 1919. The county's population was majority African-American, with an economy based on agriculture: cotton, dairy farming and logging. Many blacks left before World War II because of poor economic opportunities, racial violence, and social oppression under Jim Crow, decreasing the black population by 29% from 1940 to 1960, following earlier declines. More than six million blacks left the Southern United States in the Great Migration to the North, the Midwest, and, beginning in the 1940s, the West Coast.

Mississippi's state constitution, enacted in 1890, politically disfranchised African-Americans, using provisions such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses to raise barriers to voter registration and exclude blacks from voting. In the early 1960s, a local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was founded by E.W. Steptoe for the purpose of registering black voters. He was soon joined by Bob Moses of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In August 1961, Moses filed charges against Billy Jack Caston, cousin to Sheriff Daniel Jones and son-in-law of pro-segregation state legislator E.H. Hurst, for an assault against him and other civil rights activists by a white mob. It was the first time that an African-American had legally challenged white violence in Amite County. The all-white jury acquitted Caston, and Moses was escorted to the county line, ostensibly for his own safety. Moses left the county in January 1962.\\"Murder of Herbert Lee and Louis Allen\\", Amite County, Mississippi Civil Rights Project. Retrieved March 16, 2014 Steptoe consulted with Justice Department agents in Jackson about intimidation tactics used by Hurst and other prominent whites in the town of Liberty. On September 25, 1961, Hurst shot and killed an NAACP member named Herbert Lee at the Westbrook Cotton Gin. Allen and eleven other men witnessed the murder. When a coroner's inquest was conducted hours later, in a courtroom filled with armed white men, Allen and the other witnesses were pressured into giving false testimony. They supported Hurst's claim of shooting Lee in self-defense, leading Hurst to be cleared of any wrongdoing. However, Allen later told fellow activists the truth behind Lee's killing. He also discussed the incident with Julian Bond, who encouraged him to tell his story to the FBI. Bond was aware that, in the racially charged atmosphere of Amite County, Allen was at high personal risk if it became known that he had talked to the Bureau. Interviewed in 2011, Bond said: > \\"He lied [at Hurst's inquest] because he was in fear of his life...If he had > implicated a powerful white man in a murder of a black man, he was risking > his life...I tried to encourage him to tell the truth, but you know, it was > like saying, 'Why don't you volunteer to be killed?'\\" Learning that a federal jury was to consider charges against Hurst, Allen talked to the FBI and the United States Commission on Civil Rights in Jackson, asking for protection if he testified. An FBI memo reported that Allen \\"expressed fear that he might be killed\\", but the Justice Department said it could not give him protection. Allen chose to repeat the official version of events which exonerated Hurst. Harassment and murder Although Allen had not cooperated with the Justice Department, rumors of his visit in Jackson quickly spread among Liberty's white community. Local whites shunned Allen and cut off customers for his logging business. In August 1962, as Allen and two other black men tried to register to vote at Amite County Courthouse, they were shot at by an unknown assailant. (No black person had been allowed to vote in Amite County since 1890.)Jack Newfield, \\"Amite County\\", from Chapter: \\"Racist Power & Terror in Southwest Mississippi\\" (1960), in A Prophetic Minority, New American Library, 1966, hosted at Chicken Bones Journal Following this incident, a white businessman threatened Allen, saying, \\"Louis, the best thing you can do is leave. Your little family‚Äîthey're innocent people‚Äîand your house could get burned down. All of you could get killed.\\"Louis Allen Murdered (Jan), CRMVet.org (Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement) When Allen reported the death threats, the FBI ‚Äì which had limited jurisdiction over civil rights cases at the time ‚Äì referred the matter to Sheriff Jones's office. The FBI did so despite an agent acknowledging in a 1961 memo that, \\"Allen was to be killed and the local sheriff was involved in the plot to kill him.\\"Cold case: \\"The Murder of Louis Allen\\", 60 Minutes (CBS), April 10, 2011, video and text Allen then allegedly became a target of harassment by Jones. In a later interview, Hank Allen described Jones as \\"mean\\", recounting how he arrested his father on trumped-up charges and beat him outside his home. On one such occasion in September 1962, Jones broke Allen's jaw with a flashlight. Moses wrote to Assistant Attorney General John Doar about Allen, making reference to \\"a plot by the sheriff and seven other men.\\" Jones' father was a high-ranking Exalted Cyclops in Liberty's chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. FBI documentation from the 1960s claimed that Jones was also a Klan member. When Allen was released from jail, he filed an assault complaint with the FBI against Jones. He summarily testified before an all- white federal grand jury; as blacks had been prevented from registering and voting, they could not serve on juries. The jury dismissed his complaint. Allen stayed in Liberty because he was caring for his elderly parents.\\"Deposition of Mrs. Elizabeth Allen, Amite County, Mississippi, 1965\\", Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement website, 2011 Among his associates was Leo McKnight, who had worked with him and twice tried to register to vote with him. In February 1963, McKnight and his family died in a suspicious fire that local blacks believed was a murder. In November 1963, Jones arrested Allen again, falsely charging him for bouncing a check and having a concealed weapon. Law enforcement officials threatened Allen with three to five years in prison; after three weeks, the NAACP raised the bail for Allen. In January 1964, after his mother died, Allen arranged to leave Liberty and move in with his brother in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as he feared for his life. On January 31, the night before his planned departure, Allen was ambushed at the cattle grid at the border of his property. He was killed by two shotgun blasts to the head. His body was found by his son Hank. Interviewed in 2011, Hank said, \\"He [Sheriff Daniel Jones] told my mom that if Louis had just shut his mouth, that he wouldn't be layin' there on the ground. He wouldn't be dead.\\" Allen's death is mentioned in the first memoir of civil rights activist Anne Moody titled Coming of Age in Mississippi. When Moody writes about reasons she should stay away from her family, she mentions Allen's murder. Investigations No thorough investigation into Allen's murder was conducted until 1994. That year, Plater Robinson, a history professor at Tulane University, began examining the case files. Robinson's research in the following years pointed to Jones as a likely suspect in the killing. In 1998, Robinson conducted a tape-recorded interview with Alfred Knox, an elderly black preacher in Liberty, who reported that Jones had recruited his son-in-law, Archie Weatherspoon, to \\"kill Louis Allen\\". When Weatherspoon refused Jones' request to \\"pull the trigger\\", Jones allegedly killed Allen himself. Both Knox and Weatherspoon have since died. In 2007, the FBI reopened Allen's case as one of a number of civil rights-era cold cases it was examining. Its staff identified Jones as the prime suspect. , the FBI has been unable to collect enough evidence to prosecute. In April 2011, the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes broadcast a report about the Allen case. Correspondent Steve Kroft had traveled to Liberty to interview local residents and was largely met with silence. Kroft interviewed Jones on his property; the elderly man denied killing Allen, and he invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about his alleged Klan membership.

The cases concerned substantial defective works and whether the assignee who was directly impacted could recover money for this directly (the Linden appeal) and/or the assignor (the original owner) could recover the money by suing the works contractor (the St Martin's appeal). The standard Joint Contracts Tribunal contract clause used could, the Court held, legitimately on grounds of public policy somewhat prohibit assignment (that is be subject to its qualified consent to assign the underlying asset, the property). The two potential lines of liability were decided in the negative and in the affirmative respectively. In summary, the first case was not brought by the original owner who commissioned the works (the new owner of the building should have considered the old asbestos contractor in his purchase transaction), the second case was brought by the original owner, still in business, at the behest of the new owner and in a case where both the original parties knew the development would very likely be assigned and relied on by third parties. Facts Stock Conversions Ltd, the original lessee of a building, used a JCT standard form contract to hire Lenesta to remove asbestos. Clause 17(1) said \\"The employer shall not without written consent of the contractor assign this contract.\\" Lenesta subcontracted another firm to do the job. More asbestos was soon found, and a third business was contracted. Then Stock Conversions Ltd assigned the building lease to Linden Gardens, and at the same time, without Lenesta ever having consented, assigning its right of action (against Lenesta) to Linden Gardens. More asbestos was found and Linden Gardens sued the contractors for negligence and breach of contract. The Court of Appeal found the assignment was effective. Lenesta appealed. In a second joined case, St Martin's Property Corp Ltd (\\"St Martin's\\") had been granted a 150-year lease on a site where they commissioned a shop development -- in 1974 using the JCT standard contract with clause 17 as in the other conjoined appeal to hire Sir Robert McAlpine as a builder. St Martin's assigned their property interest and the benefits of the contracts to a new owner after the works were completed, without their contractor's consent. Then in 1981 it was found that the building work was defective, and remedial work would cost ¬£800,000. The Court of Appeal by a majority held the assignment was incorrect but that St Martin's was entitled to damages. Judgment The House of Lords held that a true construction of clause 17(1) prohibited assignment without consent and that since a party to such a contract might have a genuine commercial interest in ensuring that contractual relations with the party he selected were preserved, there was no reason for holding the contractual prohibition on assignment as being contrary to public policy. In the second case because the development was, to the knowledge of the parties, very likely to be occupied or purchased by third parties, any defective works damage would accrue to a subsequent owner rather than the original developer. Because of the specific contractual provision that rights of action were not assignable without the defendants' consent, the parties could properly be treated as having entered into the contract on the basis that the first claimants would be entitled to enforce against the defendant's contractual duties on behalf of all those third parties who would suffer from defective performance of the contract but were unable to acquire rights under it, subject to causation, limitation periods and quantum. Accordingly, the first plaintiffs were entitled to substantial damages for any breaches of the contract by the defendants. Lord Browne-Wilkinson adapted the concept of Lord Diplock in The Albazero[1977] AC 774, 847 that there is an exception applicable to contracts of carriage: ‚Äòthat the consignor may recover substantial damages against the shipowner if there is privity of contract between him and the carrier for the carriage of goods; although, if the goods are not his property or at his risk, he will be accountable to the true owner for the proceeds of his judgment.‚Äô See also *English contract law Notes References * External links * English contract case law 1993 in British law 1993 in case law House of Lords cases ","title":"Linden Gardens Trust Ltd v Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd"},{"id":"31468218","text":"Eric George Munn was the sixth Bishop of Caledonia.\\"Who was Who\\" 1897-2007 London, A & C Black, 2007 He was born 8 March 1903, educated at University of Leeds and ordained in 1930 after studying at the College of the Resurrection, Mirfield.Crockford's Clerical Directory1940-41 Oxford, OUP, 1941 After a curacy at Wigan he was a missionary at Quesnel and the Lytton, British Columbia.

Lord Chief Justice Cockburn said the following. Blackburn J concurred. Lush J and Mellor J stated their concurrence. New Zealand case law, Couch v Branch Investments (1969) Ltd, cites this case.

It is located entirely in Austria within the state of Tyrol. This sub-group is somewhat in the shadows of its more famous neighbour, the Wetterstein to the north. Whilst the region around the Coburger Hut and the lakes of Seebensee and Drachensee in the west (Ehrwalder Sonnenspitze and Vorderer Tajakopf with its new klettersteig over the Tajakante) and the Hohe Munde in the extreme east receive large numbers of visitors, the less developed central area remains very quiet. The Hohe Munde is also a popular and challenging ski touring destination. Public transport links: The Au√üerfern Railway stops at Ehrwald on the western side of the range. Busses run from Leutasch on the southern side of the mountains to Mittenwald and Seefeld in Tirol.  Geology  The Mieminger Mountains lie in a particularly interesting region from a geological standpoint. Between the peaks of the Sonnenspitze, Wetterstein and Daniel, three geological units meet that, during the course of mountain building, were piled on top of one another as nappes and today are adjacent to one together. The Mieminger Mountains are located in one of these stacks: the Inn Valley or Inntal Stack. Almost all the rocks in the Mieminger range were formed at one stage on the seabed and consist of limestone and its derivative, dolomite. In addition there are sandstones, argillites, hornfels, carbonate breccias (rauhwackes) and volcanic tuffs. In relation to the total age of the Earth, which is about 4,500 million years, the rocks of the Mieminger Mountains come mainly from two relatively small windows of time. One of these began about 250 million years ago and ended 130 million years ago (during the Triassic and Jurassic Periods), whilst the second window is the last 10,000 years since the end of the W√ºrm glaciation (part of the Cenozoic). There are no older rocks that predate those from in the first window, and the more recent ones have been eroded by wind, weather and water since the Alpine orogeny about 35 million years ago. =Mesozoic Era= The mountains' geological history began in tropical climes, on the edge of a broad and shallow sea: the Alpine Tethys. To begin with, material was deposited that had been washed into the sea from the land; then the sea level rose and limestone-forming organisms began to populate it. Marine deposits that were near the shore, made of limestones, dolomitic rocks and breccias, are still layered in places in a narrow strip of land between Langlehn and Igelskar (Reichenhall Strata). Because they weather relatively easily, they form cols (Scharte) and T√∂rle like the Biberwierer Scharte or the Tajat√∂rl. During the next time period, a thick sequence of dark limestones was formed - the Alpine muschelkalks - which, when struck, often smell slightly of bitumen and are striking because of their uneven, irregular surface layers. Irregularly shaped, dark brown to black hornfels nodules (Knauern) and greenish tuffs occur in these limestones that indicate the presence of nearby Stromboli-like volcanoes. This sequence arose from a shallow, oxygen-rich marine environment, in which reefs and basins alternated with one another. Some time afterwards the Partnach Strata were formed that are especially attractive in the Schw√§rz between the Marienbergspitzen and Wampertem Schrofen. They consist of light-coloured limestone interbedded with argillites. Next, reefs began to develop in the shallow waters of the sea, in which small coralline algae (haptophytes) and corals lived. Their dead, limy skeletons form the most important rock: Wetterstein limestone. This mostly bright white and weather-resistant limestone contrasts strongly with the other rocks. It forms the striking summits of the Mieminger and Wetterstein Mountains, not least the Sonnenspitze, Igelskopf and Zugspitze. Because Wetterstein limestone contains few plant nutrients, its scree and talus slopes are largely unvegetated and this tends to characterise the scene above the tree line. A feature of Wetterstein limestone is silver-containing lead and zinc ore. These were mined at Silberleithe and in the rest of the Mieminger Mountains. The Triassic Period in the Mieminger Chain ends with Wetterstein limestone and is then followed by the Jurassic whose deposits are of less importance. They were largely carried off in the course of the millions of years and only still exist in a few sheltered sites or underground. =Alpine Orogeny= At the time of their deposition the rocks of the Northern Limestone Alps were located several hundred kilometres south of their present position. About 35 million years ago, tectonic forces, that are still active today, began to push these geological units northwards. At that time several kilometres of rock and several hundred metres of water lay on top of the rocks visible today. As a result there was a massive overlapping pressure that prevented the formations underneath from breaking up as they were pushed together. As a result of the compressional forces, thrust faulting occurred piling the rock layers up into nappes (Gesteinsdecken). For example, the steep slopes falling away from the Mieminger Mountains into the Ehrwald Basin or the Leutasch River are the front of such a nappe, also called the Inn Valley Stack (Inntaldecke). At the same time the rocks were uplifted. Taken together these processes are referred to as orogeny or mountain building. =Ice ages= The relatively recent deposits in the up to 70 metre deep moors are predominantly gravels, shingles, clay, humus and peat; the latter even being used at one time near Lermoos for the lead-zinc smelter of the Silberleithen cooperative (Gewerkschaft). The finishing touches to the mountains and valleys took place during the W√ºrm glaciation. The ice sheet of the Loisach Glacier was about 1,000 metres thick and, after the ice had melted about 10,000 years ago, it left behind that typical feature of ice age terrain: moraines. The remnants of the ice sheet in the mountains formed classic cirques, in which the last moraines of the glacier have survived. The major change to the landscape since the last ice age was the Fern Pass landslide that filled the valley between Biberwier and Nassereith to a depth of 200 metres. Since then the scenery has changed very little. Occasionally there are rock avalanches, landslides or mudflows. Water, ice and wind continue to attack the rocks, transporting their debris down the mountain torrents into the valleys and reminding us that these geological processes continue today.  Neighbouring ranges  The Mieminger Chain borders on the following other mountain ranges of the Alps: * Stubai Alps (to the south) * √ñtztal Alps (to the southwest) * Lechtal Alps (to the west) * Wetterstein (to the north) * Karwendel (to the east) In the AVE, the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps, published in 1984, the Mieminger and Wetterstein ranges are shown as a single unit.  Boundaries  To the south the River Inn forms the boundary of the range from the Niederbach stream near Inzing upstream as far as its confluence with the Gurglbach near Imst. Its western boundary runs along the Gurgltal valley from Imst to Nassereith and over the Fern Pass to Ehrwald. To the north its boundary runs from Ehrwald along the Gaisbach stream and the Ehrwalder Alm into the Gaistal (Leutascher Ache) and continues through Leutasch‚ÄìOberweidach and past the Simmelberg to the north to the Drahnbach. The eastern boundary runs along the stream of Drahnbach and over the Seefelder saddle, then downhill along the Niederbach to its confluence with the Inn. The Fern Pass links the Mieminger range with the Lechtal Alps. The unnamed saddle near the Ehrwalder Alm is the link between the Mieminger Chain and the Wetterstein. The Seefelder saddle links the Mieminger Chain with the Karwendel.  Sub-divisions  The Alpine Club Guide divides the Mieminger Chain into the following sub-groups: * Main crest (Hauptkamm) (from the Hohe Munde to the Hochwannig) * Northern side ridges (N√∂rdliche Seitenk√§mme) (Wampeter Schrofen, Schartenkopf, Sonnenspitze, Breitenkopf, Igelsk√∂pfe, Tajak√∂pfe, Drachenk√∂pfe) * Southern side ridges (S√ºdliche Seitenk√§mme) (Hintereggenkamm, Judenkopfkamm, Schlosskopfkamm, Wankspitzen, Arzbergkamm, H√∂llkopf) * Tschirgant-Simmering massif (Tschirgant- Simmering-Stock) (Tschirgant, Simmering) * The hills between Seefeld and the Buchener Saddle near the Hohe Munde are not described in the guide. Orographically they are definitely part of the Mieminger Chain.  Peaks  The Ehrwalder Sonnenspitze (2,412 m) from the Coburger Hut The Hochplattig (2,768 m) and Hochwand (2,719 m) from the Hohe Munde The 10 highest peaks in the Mieminger Chain are the: * Hochplattig, main summit, 2768 m * Hochplattig, Westeck, 2749 m * √ñstliche Griesspitzen, 2747 m * Westliche Griesspitzen, 2741 m * Hochwand, Nordostgipfel, 2719 m * Hochwand, S√ºdwestgipfel, 2715 m * √ñstliche Mitterspitze, 2705 m * Hochplattig, Signalgipfel, 2698 m * Westliche Mitterspitze, 2693 m * Mittlere Mitterspitze, 2686 m In the Mieminger Mountains there are over 60 named peaks with spot heights. The best known, in order of height, are the: * Gr√ºnstein, 2,666 m * Hohe Munde, 2,659 m * Wannig, 2,493 m * Vorderer Tajakopf, 2,452 m * Ehrwalder Sonnenspitze, 2,417 m * Hinterer Tajakopf, 2,409 m * Tschirgant, 2,370 m * Wankspitze, 2,208 m * Simmering, 2,096 m In the area of the 1,789 m high Marienbergjoch is a ski area.  Tourism  = Huts = There are three Alpine Club huts in the Mieminger Mountains, only one of which is managed. * Alplhaus: height: 1,506 m, self-catering (special lock), not managed, key obtainable from the Munich Alpine Club, 16 mattress spaces, base: Wildermieming, duration from Wildermieming: 2 hours * Breitenkopf Hut: height: 2,040 m, self-catering (Alpine Club key), not managed, 5 mattress spaces, base: Ehrwald, duration from Ehrwald: 3.5 hours * Coburger Hut: height: 1,920 m, managed from the start of June to October, 80 mattress spaces, winter room with 10 bedspaces, base: Ehrwald, duration from the Ehrwalder Alm (cable car): 2 hours = Long- distance trails = The Via Alpina, a cross-border long-distance trail with five sections through the whole Alps, runs through the Mieminger Mountains. The Red Path (Rote Weg) of the Via Alpina has two stages running through the range as follows: * Stage R46 runs from the Reintalanger Hut to the Coburger Hut. The first part of this stage runs through the Wetterstein. * Stage R47 runs from the Coburger Hut through Biberwier to the Wolfratshauser Hut. The second part of this stage runs through the Lechtal Alps.  References  * Rudolf Wutscher: Alpenvereinsf√ºhrer Mieminger Kette.

Formed in the year 1991, the band had released numerous albums and singles, and toured the US and internationally.  History  Mickie Rat attended Sacramento State University where he met D.J. Willis (a guitarist with whom he worked on the college radio station) and a drummer named Dave Leon. They decided to form a band, naming it \\"The Secretions\\" based on a list of band names Willis kept on his fridge. Shortly after the decision to form the band, Willis died in a vehicular accident. Mickie Rat met Danny Secretion (who had worked on the radio station, but whom he had never met) at Willis's funeral, and recruited him as a guitarist. The original band lineup was Mickie Rat on bass, Dave Leon on drums, and Danny Secretion on guitar. The band went through a number of lineup changes and various short-lived members through the early to late 1990s. Kevin Stockton joined as guitarist, replacing Morgan Giles. The lineup then stabilized for several years, with Danny Secretion on drums, Mickie Rat on bass, and Kevin Stockton on guitar. Stockton was replaced on guitar by Paul Filthy in 2005.  Musical style and influences  The Secretions wrote songs on a range of subjects, including non-human love interests (\\"Zombie Girl\\", \\"Alien Girl\\", \\"She's A Robot/Boxcar II\\"), horror themes (\\"Fuckin' Zombies\\", \\"Cemetery Pogo\\"), Mexican wrestling (\\"Viva La Lucha Libre\\", \\"Tony Silva Rides The Bus\\"), touring and performing (\\"Double O Summer\\", \\"Mickie's On The Crapper\\"), and experiences of not fitting in (\\"I Still Think Cindy Crawford Is Ugly\\", \\"Freaks Like Us\\"). They did not have an overall theme or favorite subject, and said that they just wrote about whatever they felt like at the time. The band cited Screeching Weasel, The Ramones, The Queers, Mot√∂rhead, and Rancid as their main influences.  Tours, collaborations, and other projects  The Secretions released numerous albums and EPs, including split EPs and appearances on compilations. They have completed national USA tours with bands like The Teenage Harlets and Final Summation, and have shared the stage with Chixdiggit, Pansy Division, Luckie Strike, Link 80, Good Riddance, Marky Ramone, and The Crumbs. In 2006, the Secretions won a competition on Sacramento's KWOD radio station to play the Arco Arena with Papa Roach, Gnarls Barkley, and My Chemical Romance. The Secretions have won local area music awards SAMMIES (Sacramento Area Music Awards) three consecutive times and were nominated to the local area music hall of fame. Danny Secretion toured as the drummer for the Groovie Ghoulies on their first North American tour with Screw 32 and The Queers, and is listed as a past member of the band on their Myspace page. He was the recording and touring guitarist for Kepi Ghoulie's first electric solo efforts. Danny currently plays guitar for the Knockoffs, guitar for The Moans, bass for Captain 9's & The Knickerbocker Trio, plays solo acoustic, and performs as his lounge singer alter-ego Gene Chowder. Mickie Rat briefly drummed for Sacramento band the Mallrats and played bass for Rat-o-Matic. He currently drums for Spitting Roses.

Biography Chertok obtained his doctorate in medicine in Prague in 1938. He came to Paris in 1939, and joined the French resistance. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre. In 1947 he worked in a psychiatric ward at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, in a psychosomatic unit directed by the psychoanalyst Lawrence Kubie. When back in France he underwent analysis with Jacques Lacan from 1948 until 1954. From 1948 to 1949 he worked as an assistant for Marcel Montassut at the psychiatric hospital in Villejuif. In 1950 he organized the center for psychosomatic medicine at Villejuif, with Victor Gachkel; also visited by Franz Alexander. During this period he did voluntary work under the urologist Pierre Aboulker. In the 1950s he went to the USA and let himself be hypnotized by Milton Erickson, and in Germany by Johannes Heinrich Schultz. It was at this time that he met the psychoanalyst Raymond de Saussure and the specialist on animal magnetism Robert Amadou. In 1957 he took part in the founding of the French society of psychosomatic medicine, with Michel Sapir and Pierre Aboulker. In 1959, he gave his first lecture on hypnosis for psychoanalysts under the auspices of Henri Ey's society L'√©volution psychiatrique. The end of the 1970s and the 1980s was marked by his exchanges with philosophers such as Fran√ßois Roustang, Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen, Michel Henry and Isabelle Stengers. Chertok found that the psychoanalysts neglected the practice and phenomenon of hypnosis, and thus made himself an object of fierce criticism from their side. He underwent, as mentioned, analysis with Jacques Lacan, and was a student of Francis Pasche, but he was not accepted as a member of the Societe Psychanalytique de Paris. Chertok also had some contact with Soviet psychiatrists. His position as a \\"heretic\\" led to his isolation and to the neglect of his ideas concerning hypnosis, thus favoring the Ericksonian school. In several books and papers written in collaboration with Isabelle Stengers Chertok repeatedly criticized traditional psychoanalysis and its institutions.

There also was a book written by Conrad of Megenberg in the 14th century with the original German title of \\"Buch der Natur\\". Early theologians believed the Book of Nature was a source of God's revelation to mankind: when read alongside sacred scripture, the \\"book\\" of nature and the study of God's creations would lead to a knowledge of God himself. The concept corresponds to the early Greek philosophical belief that man, as part of a coherent universe, is capable of understanding the design of the natural world through reason. The concept is frequently deployed by philosophers, theologians, and scholars. The first use of the phrase is unknown. However, Galileo used the phrase, quoting Tertullian, when he wrote of how \\" ‚ÄúWe conclude that God is known first through Nature, and then again, more particularly, by doctrine; by Nature in His works, and by doctrine in His revealed word.‚Äù (5) (5) Adversus Marcionem, I, 18..\\"Galileo, Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany, 1615, Verses 272-279 Origins From the earliest times in known civilizations, events in the natural world were expressed through a collection of stories concerning everyday life. In ancient times, a mortal world existed alongside an upper world of spirits and gods acting through nature to create a unified and intersecting moral and natural cosmos. Humans, living in a world that was acted upon by free acting and conspiring gods of nature, attempted to understand their world and the actions of the divine by observing and correctly interpreting natural phenomena, such as the motion and position of stars and planets. Efforts to interpret and understand divine intentions led mortals to believe that intervention and influence over godly acts was possible‚Äîeither through religious persuasion, such as prayer or gifts, or through magic, which depended on sorcery and the manipulation of nature in order to bend the will of the gods. Knowing divine intentions and anticipating divine actions through the manipulation of the natural world was believed achievable and the most effective approach. Thus, mankind had a reason to know nature.Pedersen (1992), pp. 5-6 Around the sixth century BC, man‚Äôs relationship with the deities and nature began to change. Greek philosophers, such as Thales of Miletus, no longer viewed natural phenomena as the result of free acting, omnipotent gods. Rather, natural forces resided within nature, which was an integral part of a created world, and appeared under certain conditions that had little to do with the manipulative tendencies of personal deities. Furthermore, the Greeks believed that natural phenomena occurred by ‚Äúnecessity‚Äù through intersecting chains of ‚Äúcause‚Äù and ‚Äúeffect.‚Äù Greek philosophers, however, lacked a technical vocabulary to express such abstract concepts as ‚Äúnecessity‚Äù or ‚Äúcause‚Äù and consequently co-opted words available in the Greek language to refer metaphorically to the new philosophy of nature. Accordingly, the Greeks conceptualized the natural world in more specific terms that aligned with a new philosophy that viewed nature as immanent in which natural phenomena occurred by necessity. In Christianity early Church Fathers appeared to use the idea of a book of nature, librum naturae, as part of a two-book theology: \\"Among the Fathers of the Church, explicit references to the Book of Nature can be found, in St. Basil, St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. Augustine, John Cassian, St. John Chrysostom, St. Ephrem the Syrian, St. Maximus the Confessor.\\" \\"The two books prior to the scientific revolution.\\" Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith (2005): 4-5. Link: http://inters.org/tanzella- nitti/pdf/9.TwoBooks.pdf The Aristotelian corpus The Greek concept of nature, metaphorically expressed in the Book of Nature, gave birth to three philosophical traditions that became the wellspring for natural philosophy and early scientific thinking. Among the three traditions inspired by Plato, Aristotle, and Pythagoras, the Aristotelian corpus became a pervasive force in natural philosophy until it was challenged in early modern times. Natural philosophy, which encompassed a body of work whose purpose was to describe and explain the natural world, derived its foremost authority from Aristotle, who viewed natural philosophy as a doctrine intended to explain natural events in terms of readily understood causes. In contrast, Aristotle considered the purely abstract mathematical constructs by Plato and Pythagoras inadequate for knowing the natural world because of their inability to provide causal explanations. Aristotle reasoned that knowledge of natural phenomena was derived by abstraction from a sensory awareness of the natural world‚Äîin short, knowledge was obtained through sensory experience. A world constructed by abstract ideas alone could not exist. Furthermore, the structures inherent in nature are revealed through this process of abstraction, which may result in metaphysical principles that can be used to explain a variety of natural phenomena, including their causes and effects. Events that have no identifiable cause happen by chance and reside outside the boundaries of natural philosophy. The search for causal explanations became a dominant focus in natural philosophy whose origins lay in the Book of Nature as conceived by the earliest Greek philosophers. Rediscovering God The Greeks succeeded in constructing a view of the natural world in which all references to mythological origins and causes were removed. By abandoning ancient ties to free acting, conspiring gods of nature, Greek philosophers inadvertently left the upper world vacant. The new philosophy of nature made unseen mythological forces irrelevant. While some philosophers drifted toward atheism, others worked within the new philosophy to reconstitute the concept of a divine being. Consequently, the new outlook toward the natural world inspired the belief for a supreme force that was compatible with the new philosophy‚Äîin other words, monotheistic. However, the path leading from nature to rediscovering a divine being was uncertain. Once again, the Book of Nature was consulted, and it was Aristotle who interpreted its spoken text. The belief in causality in nature implied an endless, interconnected chain of causation acting upon the natural world. It is presumed, however, that Greek thought denied the existence of a natural world where causality was infinite, which gave rise to Aristotle's doctrine of \\"efficient cause,\\" or ‚Äúfirst cause,\\" upon which the order of other causes must rely. The pathway to heaven became clear: ‚Äúthe First Cause is also the Prime Mover of the world; and, since motion is a fact revealed by the senses, the Prime Mover must exist by necessity, a being unable to be otherwise than it is. Consequently, it is also perfect and thus the ultimate object of desire, or the ‚ÄòSupreme Good‚Äô. And, since nature operates for a purpose, the Prime Mover must also be intelligent. Being eternal it is divine‚Ä¶‚Äù and we now know of it as ‚ÄúGod.‚Äù The ultimate cause, or source, of all natural phenomena occurring in the natural world had been discovered. There was but one God, and He has created all that resides in the Book of Nature. Christianity and Greek culture The first contact between Christianity and Greek culture occurred in Athens in the first century A.D. Christian theologians viewed the Greeks as a pagan culture whose philosophers were obsessed with the wonders of the material, or natural, world. Observation and explanation of natural phenomena were of little value to the Church. Consequently, early Christian theologians dismissed Greek knowledge as being perishable in contrast to true knowledge derived from sacred Scripture. Yet, the Church Fathers struggled with questions concerning the natural world and its creation that reflected the concerns of Greek philosophers. Despite their rejection of pagan thinking, the Church Fathers benefited from Greek dialectic and ontology by inheriting a technical language that could help express solutions to their concerns. As Peter Harrison observes, ‚Äúin the application of the principles of pagan philosophy to the raw materials of a faith, the content of which was expressed in those documents which were to become the New Testament, we can discern the beginnings of Christian theology.‚Äù Eventually, Church Fathers would recognize the value of the natural world because it provided a means of deciphering God‚Äôs work and acquiring true knowledge of Him. In other words, God has infused the material world with symbolic meaning, which if understood by man, reveals higher spiritual truths. For the moment, however, the Church‚Äôs indifference to nature would prevail in ecclesiastical matters. What the Church Fathers needed, and did not inherit from the early Greek philosophers, was a method of interpreting the symbolic meanings embedded in the material world. According to Harrison, it was Church Father Origen in the third century who perfected a hermeneutical method that was first developed by the Platonists of the Alexandrian school by which the natural world could be persuaded to give up hidden meanings. ‚ÄúThis universal hermeneutic was to provide interpretive strategies for dealing with both texts and objects in the physical world. It lay at the foundation of the ‚Äòsymbolist mentality‚Äô of the middle ages, and was the sine qua non of the medieval image of the ‚Äòbook of nature‚Äô.\\" For their part, the Platonists believed the visible world reveals knowledge about the invisible world, which in turn, reveals truth and knowledge of the Creator. Origen then demonstrated how the natural world could be made intelligible to man through a process that exposed the spiritual realities which the material world signified. Thus, if the natural world was created to minister to the physical and spiritual needs of mankind, reading the Book of Nature ensured both needs could be fulfilled, in part through what the visible world signifies. The importance of reading the Book of Nature alongside sacred Scripture became evident because references to the natural world in sacred text were unintelligible unless the reader was knowledgeable about the Book of Nature in order to understand these references and interpret their meaning. However, whereas the Book of Nature served Scripture well, it lacked internal order and discernible relationships between the objects it represented thereby reducing nature to an inchoate and unintelligible language. The Book of Nature required substantial editing and revision, which would not occur for another nine hundred years. Rediscovering the natural world By the twelfth century, a renewed study of nature was beginning to emerge along with the recovered works of ancient philosophers, which were being translated from Arabic and original Greek. The writings of Aristotle were among the most important of the ancient texts and had a remarkable influence among intellectuals. Interest in the material world, in conjunction with the doctrines of Aristotle, elevated sensory experience to new levels of importance. Earlier teachings concerning the relationship between God and man‚Äôs knowledge of material things were giving way to a world in which knowledge of the material world conveyed knowledge of God. Whereas scholars and theologians once held a symbolist mentality of the natural world as expressive of spiritual realities, intellectual thinking now regarded nature as a ‚Äúcoherent entity which could be systematically investigated by the senses. The idea of nature is that of a particular ordering of natural objects, and the study of nature the systematic investigation of that order.‚Äù The notion of order in nature implied a structure to the physical world whereby relationships between objects could be defined. According to Harrison, the twelfth century marked an important time in the Christian era when the world became invested with its own patterns of order‚Äîpatterns based on networks of likeness or similarities among material things, which served to determine the character of a pre-modern knowledge of nature. While God has made all things that reside in the Book of Nature, certain objects in nature share similar characteristics with other objects, which delineates the sphere of nature and ‚Äúestablishes the systematising principles upon which knowledge of the natural world is based.‚Äù Thus, the Book of Nature was acquiring a table of contents and its subject matter could now be indexed. No longer a catalogue of religious symbols, the Book of Nature attained a unified and coherent whole in which the meaning of its contents was discernible. Indeed, nature could now be read like a book. Reading the Book of Nature Scholars, natural philosophers, emerging naturalists, and other readers of the new Book of Nature enthusiastically renewed their investigation of the natural world. Alongside sacred Scripture, the Book of Nature also became a font of divine revelation and a source of knowledge of God. This also implied that for mankind, nature itself became a new authority concerning the divine. There now existed two ways of knowing God‚Äîtwo texts, or two \\"books\\"‚Äîsacred Scripture and the Book of Nature, and two separate authorities, which was disquieting to many contemporary observers. Which textual authority took precedence? How would inconsistencies between the two texts be resolved? Who would mediate between the two books and exercise final interpretive authority? As Harrison points out, the exegesis of the Book of Nature became a critical concern, especially to the Church. Religious indifference to the material world, which had survived for centuries, came to an end by the thirteenth century. Interest in nature by Church Fathers would transform the study of nature into a theological enterprise. The Book of Nature became a bestseller among clerics and theologians anxious for its knowledge in their search for divine truth and concern for preserving and strengthening the authority of the Church in all matters ecclesiastical, which now included the Book of Nature. Two books ‚Äî two worlds? By the sixteenth century, discord between traditional authorities was beginning to surface. Ancient texts and doctrines were disputed, knowledge of the natural world was found to be incomplete, interpretation of Scripture was being challenged, and Greek philosophy, which helped draft the Book of Nature, and Scripture were viewed as fundamentally opposed. The Book of Nature was acquiring greater authority, for its wisdom and as an unmediated source of natural and divine knowledge. As a source of revelation, the Book of Nature remained moored to the Christian faith and occupied a prominent location in Western culture alongside sacred Scripture. The concern that these two books would eventually collide, however, was becoming increasingly evident among scholars, natural philosophers, and theologians, who viewed with trepidation the possibility of two separate and incompatible worlds‚Äîone determined to possess nature, and the other determined to uphold Christian faith. The social and religious transformations already underway in European society and western culture would shove these two diverging worlds even farther apart. The purpose for which the Book of Nature was written and the emerging confrontation between natural science and religion over the locus of authority on matters of truth and ideological certitude were fundamental issues that mankind, perched on the threshold of modernity, would be forced to contemplate.

USPS 499-920 The HP-10 in the centre of this line-up of Schreder gliders at the 1963 US Soaring Championships at Harris Hill, Elmira, NY. Design and development The HP-10 (HP stands for high performance) was designed by Schreder for the 1961 US Nationals. The aircraft is built from aluminium and has a V-tail. The constant-chord wing is made up from eight aluminum honeycomb-sandwich structural panels and has large flaps, using up , or 70%, of the wingspan. The wing uses a NACA 65 (3)-618 airfoil, the same profile as the HP-8. Some HP-10s were finished with Helisoar-produced fiberglass Hoerner wingtips. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel. The production rights to the HP-10 were purchased by Helisoar, a company owned by Steve duPont. The company produced a number of kits for the aircraft before production was ended. At least nine kits were completed, most in the Experimental - amateur-built category. Some were registered with the Federal Aviation Administration as Helisoar HP-10s. When Helisoar was liquidated duPont donated all the tooling, parts, drawings and engineering reports to the EAA AirVenture Museum as the Soaring Society of America had no storage space at that time. Operational history Schreder and the HP-10 won the Stroukoff Trophy in 1961 for a 57 km/h (35.5 mph) 229 km (142 miles) goal and return flight. With its high wing loading of 6.75 lb/sq ft (33.0 kg/m2) and small wing area of 114 sq ft (10.6 m2), the HP-10 developed a reputation of being difficult to keep aloft in weak soaring conditions.

It is California Historical Landmark #137. History The 49ers, on their way to the gold fields during the California Gold Rush, used this place as a ford crossing. In 1853, as the Kern River Gold Rush began, Major Aneas Gordon begin operating a ferry at the crossing of the Stockton - Los Angeles Road. It was an overhead cable type, with a flat bottom boat. With a growing number of settlers coming to the region, the ferry experienced much traffic. =Butterfield Overland Mail= In 1857, the Butterfield Overland Mail 1st Division was established and used the ferry on its San Francisco to St. Louis postal route. The stage company would establish a station at that location (one of six in Kern County), which was called the Kern River Station.Gordon's Ferry. Bakersfield Life. Accessed: 04-11-2011. Butterfield Overland Mail continued to use the ferry until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Because the original route crossed into the Confederacy, the U.S. postmaster directed Butterfield to change to the Central Overland Route. Kern River Station would continue to be used by other stagecoach companies until the railroad made them obsolete. The ferry would continue to be used by settlers and residents until 1877, when the Jewett Avenue bridge was constructed to the west. =Oilfield and bridges= As a river crossing, Gordon's Ferry sat empty for many years. However, oil was discovered in the Kern River Oil Field in 1899 (the first oil discovery in Kern County). The oilfield was just north of Gordon's Ferry. Oil was hauled out by trains, which were located in Sumner and Bakersfield, which is south of the river. As a result, in 1901 a wooden bridge was constructed at the previous ferry crossing. It would later be replaced with the concrete bridge that exists today. In 1937, the site would be declared a California Historical Landmark--the first in Kern County.Kern County Historical Chronology . Kern County Museum. Accessed: 04-11-2011.

Koun was the first Chinese American to develop an aircraft in America. Design and development Koun, a cook by profession, developed the Aircraft Dirigible Helicopter to demonstrate an aircraft with vertical takeoff and landing capability. The vehicle was constructed over the course of five years. The vehicle resembled a conventional light aircraft with the exception of two large airfoil-shaped cuffs over the wings intended to hold compressed Helium. The designer felt that using compressed helium would provide additional buoyancy, requiring less volume than an unpressurized dirigible. The exposed forward mounted engine was designed to tilt for forward or vertical thrust. A set of outrigger wheels on the wingtips were set for stability on the ground. Operational history The prototype was assembled at Roosevelt Field, New York in 1939. The CAA gave the aircraft a registration number, but not an experimental certificate. The sole flight attempt was performed in front of media. After many failed engine start attempts, the aircraft was started without the pilot and the vehicle was damaged while securing it.

They consist of five chansonniers: Copenhagen, Dijon, Nivelle, Laborde and Wolfenb√ºttel. The songbooks, smaller than a modern paperback, personalized and lavishly decorated, are the earliest surviving examples of a new genre which offered a combination of words, music, and illuminations. History The chansonniers of the late 15th century were objects of leisure, offering artistic, musical and textual aspects to form a multidimensional reading experience. Prior to the 1470s, words were written first by scribes, and then musical symbols were aligned to them. But in the 1470s, melodies were set out first, followed by their words, but not in systematic alignment, only in proximity. The books contain secular vernacular songs in three or four voice parts with text that drew upon the poetic tradition of courtly love, written by composers that were active in the Loire Valley region at approximately the same time. Each voice part is introduced by decorated initials. Out of a total 273 songs, 107 are songs surviving in just one source. Two of the chansonniers (Dijon and Laborde), have quasi- alphabetical indexes. Unlike those of Antoine Busnois, Firminus Caron's songs are poorly represented in the Loire Valley chansonniers. Of the two song attributed to Josquin des Prez, one is \\"Adieu mes amours\\". Chansonniers The Chansonnier Nivelle de la Chauss√©e is located at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris. It contains many small-scale corrections and crossed-out notes which gives insight into its principal scribe as well as several instances of large-scale erasures, post-binding, where entire voice parts were erased. Seven works of the composer Johannes Delahaye appear in it. It is widely accepted as being the earliest of the group. The Dijon Chansonnier is located in the Biblioth√®que municipale de Dijon. The composers are Barbiguant, Gilles Binchois, Busnois, Caron, Compere, Convert, Delahaye, Guillaume Dufay, Hayne van Ghizeghem, Jean Molinet, Robert Morton, Johannes Ockeghem, and Johannes Tinctoris. The Laborde Chansonnier contains over a hundred songs by Binchois, Busnois, Dufay, Ockeghem and others. Many of the songs are unique and the pages are illustrated. The songbook first came to scholarly attention in 1857 at the \\"Comit√© de la langue, de l'histoire et des arts de la France\\", the manuscript having been presented by a Comit√© member, count L√©on de Laborde, and having been sent to the Comit√© by L'abb√© Jacques- R√©mi-Antoine Texier. In 2011, Goldberg Stiftung made available their transcription of it in both modern and original clefs. It was the last to receive close musicological attention. The Copenhagen Chansonnier is a parchment manuscript containing 33 three-voiced songs from the late 15th century; one song, \\"Lactens secours\\", which was added in the 16th century; as well as modulation essays. It has been characterized as the perhaps most valuable medieval manuscript of music in the Royal Danish Library. The Wolfenb√ºttel Chansonnier Codex Guelf 287 Extrav is related to the Laborde Chansonnier. It is located at the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb√ºttel, Germany.

Life Leigh was born as Mary or Marie Brown in 1885. She was born in Manchester and was a schoolteacher until her marriage to a builder, surnamed Leigh. She joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1906, aged 20 or 21. In 1908 Leigh, Jennie Baines, Lucy Burns, Alice Paul, Emily Davison and Mabel Capper were arrested for trying to stop a Limehouse meeting on the Budget by Lloyd George. On 17 September 1909, she, Charlotte Marsh and Patricia Woodlock climbed onto the roof of Bingley Hall in Birmingham to protest at being excluded from a political meeting where the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith was giving a speech. They threw tiles which they levered up with an axe at Asquith's car and at the police. Leigh was given sentences totaling four months in Winson Green Prison. There she again protested about not being treated as a political prisoner by breaking a window and by going on hunger strike. Leigh and Patricia Woodlock were force- fed in Winson Green gaol in 1909.Myall, M. (23 September 2004). Leigh [n√©e Brown], Mary [Marie] (b. 1885, d. in or after 1965), militant suffragette. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; retrieved 1 December 2017 Leigh had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. On 18 July 1912 in Dublin, she threw a hatchet at Asquith, hitting instead Irish nationalist leader John Redmond who was injured. Leigh was unhappy with the WSPU, but refused to leave when Emmeline Pankhurst asked for loyalty or for members to leave. She remained loyal as she felt an ownership for the organisation she had helped create. Edith New and Mary Leigh's carriage being pulled from Holloway to Queen's Hall in 1908 After Emily Davison was run over by the King's horse at the Epsom Derby in 1913, Leigh and Rose Yates was at the dying Davison's bedside, and headed a guard of honour for the funeral procession. On 13 October 1913, at the Bow Baths in the East End of London, Leigh was hurt when police were hitting women and men protestors with clubs, according to Mrs Pankhurst. World War I precipitated a split between Leigh, Yates and other leading suffragettes with Emmeline Pankhurst. Pankhurst had agreed that the WSPU would suspend its militant campaign for female suffrage and back the government's fight against Germany. Leigh and other radicals disagreed with this policy, and broke away to form the \\"Suffragettes of the WSPU\\" (SWSPU). The organisation intended to be militant and national but never achieved a large impact. Like the Independent WSPU, it was created in 1916. The SWSPU passed a resolution to concentrate on women's suffrage and to not encourage debate about former WSPU leaders.

It is the only official French emblem, according to article 2 of the current Constitution of France, adopted in 1958. French Flag  French cockade  The cockade of France is the national ornament of France, obtained by circularly pleating a blue, white and red ribbon. It is composed of the three colors of the French flag with blue in the center, white immediately outside and red on the edge.  National anthem  The national anthem \\"La Marseillaise\\" was composed by Rouget de Lisle in 1792.  Marianne  Marianne embodies the Republic. A personification of liberty and reason, and a portrayal of the Goddess of Liberty, her bust is present in every city hall in France. Her face is also drawn on stamps. The name Marianne enabled the French people to take over the newborn Republic, by creating a popular figure with whom French people could easily identify.  Great Seal of France  Great Seal of France, in 1848. The headdress of Liberty is similar to the Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World), which are both prominent republican symbols. The Great Seal of France (French: Grand sceau de la R√©publique fran√ßaise) is the official seal of the French Republic. The Great Seal features Liberty personified as a seated Juno wearing a crown with seven arches. She holds a fasces and is supported by a ship's tiller with a cock printed on it. At her feet is a vase with the letters \\"SU\\" (\\"Suffrage Universel\\", \\"Universal suffrage\\"). At her right, in the background, are symbols of the arts (painter's tools), architecture (Ionic order), education (burning lamp), agriculture (a sheaf of wheat) and industry (a cog wheel). The scene is surrounded by the legend \\"R√âPUBLIQUE FRAN√áAISE, D√âMOCRATIQUE, UNE ET INDIVISIBLE\\" (\\"French Republic, democratic, one and indivisible\\") and \\"24 FEV.1848\\" (24 February 1848) at the bottom. The reverse bears the words \\"AU NOM DU PEUPLE FRAN√áAIS\\" (\\"In the name of the French people\\") surrounded by a crown of oak (symbol of perennity) and laurel (symbol of glory) leaves tied together with weed and grapes (agriculture and wealth), with the circular national motto \\"LIBERT√â, √âGALIT√â, FRATERNIT√â\\".  Coat of arms  The current coat of arms of France has been a symbol of France since 1953. A different emblem appears on the cover of French passports; it had been adopted originally by the French Foreign Ministry as a symbol for use by diplomatic and consular missions in 1912, using a design by the sculptor Jules-Cl√©ment Chaplain.  Gallic rooster  The choice of the Gallic rooster as a symbol for France dates back to the collapse of the Roman Empire and the formation of Gaul. It finds its origin in a play on word on gallus (Latin for rooster) and Gallus (Gallic). Despite its frequent use as a symbol for France, in particular by sports federations, the rooster has never been an official emblem. ‚ÄúCocorico !‚Äù (French for ‚Äúcock-a-doodle-doo‚Äù) is often used as an affirmation of French patriotism.

In November 2010 the British Centre for Science Education reported on a potential of the Centre for Intelligent Design to damage education in Scotland as well as in Northern Ireland, due to lack of safeguards against creationism and the power of the creationist organisations. In April 2011 an article was published in the Scottish newspaper The Herald which said that \\"critics have pointed to the leaders' fundamentalist Christian backgrounds and the leaps of faith inherent in their logic.\\" Its president was quoted as saying that he believed Adam was a real person, that the universe was created in six days, and that the story of Noah and the Ark was historical.

It used three separate video tubes with colored phosphors producing the primary colors, combining the images through dichroic mirrors onto a screen for viewing. As a consumer system it was enormous, expensive, impractical, and dropped as soon as the shadow mask system was successful. However, the Triniscope idea was used commercially in several niche roles for years, notably as a color replacement for the kinescope, from which it took its name. The term can also be applied to any projection television system using three tubes, but this use is rare in the literature. History =Color television= Color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common, but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or \\"gel\\") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used. In spite of these problems, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from CBS as their color broadcast in 1950.Ed Reitan, \\"CBS Field Sequential Color System\\" , 24 August 1997 RCA worked along different lines entirely, using the luminance-chrominance system. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it first combined the RGB signals from the camera into one overall brightness figure, the \\"luminance\\". The luminance signal closely matched the existing black and white broadcasts, and would display properly on existing sets. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the broadcast signal at high-frequency. On a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets, a decoder would notice the signal, filter it out from the luminance, and then process it to retrieve the color again. Although RCA's system had enormous benefits over CBS's, it had not been successfully developed because it proved difficult to produce the display tubes. Compared to the CBS system, where the color changed once a frame at 144 times a second, RCA's system changed the color continually across the line, thousands of times a second, far too fast for a mechanical filter like the CBS design. Instead, the system required small dots of colored phosphor to be deposited on the screen, instead of the even coating used in conventional sets or mechanical color systems. These dots were far too small to be accurately hit by an electron gun. If a single tube could not be built with the required performance, an obvious solution is to use multiple tubes, one for each color. A wide variety of systems attempted to use this concept, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the images for display. =Triniscope= RCA's solution was to use three conventional black and white tubes with filters on the front to produce the three primary colors. The tubes were arranged with the green-filtered tube at the bottom of the chassis, facing up. Above it and to one side was the blue-filtered tube This was aimed at right angles to the green, so light from the two crossed in space between them. At the crossing point, a dichromic mirror was positioned to reflect the blue light up, while allowing the green light to pass through unchanged. Both \\"beams\\" were now traveling toward the top of the tube.Ed Reitan, \\"RCA Laboratories Developmental Color Receivers\\" , 18 January 1997 A third tube and mirror completed the system by adding red to the image. A suitable red phosphor was not available at the time; instead, a red Wratten filter was placed over a tube with bright yellow phosphor, and then neutral filtered to get the proper brightness in relation to the other two tubes. All three signals then shone onto a mirror at the top of the chassis, which reflected the light forward toward the viewer. There were numerous problems with the arrangement. The first, and most difficult to solve, was that the resulting system was enormous. One example system using three 10-inch kinescope monitors, was 40-inches high, 38-inches wide and 21-inches deep. This was the smallest of the Triniscope models produced with a reasonable display size; others had smaller chassis, but only at the cost of much smaller displays. The signal was decoded by filtering out the color portion of the signal and sending the left-over luminance signal to all three tubes evenly. The color signal was then used to gate each color tube to the correct brightness levels. This required separate circuits for each tube, and even the most developed example required a total of 44 vacuum tubes in four separate chassis units. The system was expensive, both to build and to keep running. Given the cost and complexity, RCA also built prototype units using a two-color system, orange and cyan. Similar systems had been used to produce low-cost color films as early as the 1920s.Ed Reitan, \\"RCA Dot Sequential Color System\\" , 28 August 1997 =NTSC= During the early color meetings hosted by the FCC, the selection board made it clear they did not consider the Triniscope to be an acceptable solution. They allowed RCA to use the system in order to illustrate the dot-sequential system, but stated that only a system with a single display tube would be selected.George Harold Brown, \\"And part of which I was: recollections of a research engineer\\", Augus Cupar Publishers, 1982, pg. 197 In any event, RCA's displays never produced a reasonable image in testing. As the FCC meetings evolved into the NTSC, other researchers at RCA were hard at work on the competing shadow mask concept. By the time the next set of presentations was ready, shadow mask tubes using one or three guns were available. These did not fare any better in viewing tests, but critically, it was due to the signaling system, not the tubes. By that point, RCA had abandoned further development of the Triniscope. =Further use= Although the shadow mask worked, it had a number of practical drawbacks. Notable among these was the dim images it produced as a side-effect of the mask blocking off most of the power from the electron guns. Development of other solutions to the color problem continued throughout the 1950s and 60s, including commercial development of the Triniscope. The Triniscope was first used as a color analog of the existing kinescope systems it was originally developed from. NBC and Path√© demonstrated a working system as early as 1954.\\"NCB Ready With 35-MM. Color Kine\\", Billboard, 1 May 1954, pg. 9 However, in tests the system proved to be only \\"resonsable\\" so development continued in order to improve the quality.Abramson & Sterling, pg. 67 However, during the same period the first video tape systems were being introduced, and the expense of the color printing used in the Triniscope made it an expensive option. Improvements in color film technology improved the system and work on the concept continued into the 1970s.Abramson & Sterling, pg. 198 The Triniscope also saw limited development for consumer television use. One example is the Mitsubishi 6CT-338, which used three 5-inch CRTs arranged behind a faux screen on the front of the display. The image was viewable as a small image centered within the larger faux screen. Using three separate tube resulted in image brightness no shadow mask set could match, but because the image was \\"behind\\" the front of the display, the system had a limited display angle.\\"LabGuy's World: Early Television Foundation Convention 2010\\" See also * Geer tube, used three guns in a single tube to produce color * Shadow mask, the first really successful color television design, and the basis for the vast majority of televisions produced before 2000 * Chromatron, Penetron and beam-index tube were contemporaries of the shadow mask that did not see widespread use * Aperture grille, the only really successful competitor to the shadow mask References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Albert Abramson and Christopher Sterling, \\"The History of Television, 1942 to 2000\\", McFarland, 2007 External links * Triniscope receiver (1965), several photos of the Mitsubishi 6CT-338 History of television Television technology Vacuum tube displays Early color television ","title":"Triniscope"},{"id":"31469570","text":"Michael Peterson (born January 4, 1967 in Gulph Mills, Pennsylvania) is an American rower.

Development Miles Westfall was born in 1901, and raised in New Richmond, Indiana. At age 6 his passion for flying machines was ignited when he saw a group of balloons fly over his house. He brought this passion to life as an adult. He made a living in Oklahoma City by running a cafe, tuning pianos, and selling restored pianos. He built his first airplane in 1930, a Church Midwing JC-1, using a motorcycle engine for propulsion. After his experience with the Midwing, Westfall began planning an aircraft of his own design. This resulted in his Sport, first flown in 1934. Design The Westfall Sport had a welded steel tube fuselage with fabric covering. Its biplane wings were positively staggered, and were made of wood. It initially flew powered by a Ford automobile engine. Westfall mounted a cooling radiator ahead of the engine as in an automobile, cutting a hole through to allow a propeller shaft. After some experience with this layout, he replaced it with a modified OX-5 radiator below the cowling. By 1935, Westfall had reworked the airplane to use a LeBlond radial engine rated at 65 hp. Operational history The prototype was finished and test flown in Oklahoma City in 1934. After replacing the Sport‚Äôs Ford Model A engine and modified OX-5 radiator with an air-cooled 65-hp LeBlond radial, Westfall logged 1000 hours flying air tours across the United States. Just before the war began, the US Civil Aeronautics Administration mounted a crackdown against homebuilt aircraft, and Westfall was sent to jail for several months as an example to other experimenters. Variants By 1964 Westfall desired a two-place airplane, and began designing a negative-stagger biplane which he named the Mark V Special, a loose reinterpretation of the Beechcraft Model 17 Staggerwing. It had steel- tube fabric-covered fuselage and wood wings, a streamlined windscreen and Cessna-type spring main landing gear. The project took nearly eight years to completion. Westfall flew the airplane to Oshkosh in 1978. Westfall's Special was noted for its excellent landing characteristics and gentle stall, a result of installing its lower wing at a lower angle of attack than the upper and of using wings of unequal span. The airfoil was a Boeing 106R. The 43-inch-chord wings were separated by a 46-inch gap. The aerodynamics resulting from this arrangement were analyzed by William H Durand in a series of articles in EAA's Sport Aviation magazine. The fuselage is 21 feet 2 inches long with a 42-inch- wide cabin. The forward-mounted fuel tank held 30 gallons, and it was powered by a Lycoming O-290 (125 hp) and a metal propeller. Designer death Miles Westfall died on 27 April 1979, not long after introducing his Mark V Special to the aviation community. His aviation output was summarized in a 2006 magazine article.

Located on the corner of Cashel and Madras Streets in Christchurch Central City, New Zealand. It became one of the symbols of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake after 115 people lost their lives when the building collapsed during the disaster; the deaths made up about 60% of the earthquake's total fatalities. History Ruins of the CTV Building, 24 February 2011 The CTV Building was designed and constructed in about 1986. Christchurch City Council gave building consent in September 1986. Building codes for earthquake design changed frequently in New Zealand following the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake (in 1935, 1965, 1976, 1984 and 1992). A significant change in design philosophy was the change from non- ductile design of a reinforced concrete structure to a ductile approach, where it is expected that building joints yield in design earthquake events, which might make a structure uninhabitable but without it collapsing. A new reinforced concrete standard emphasising ductility came into effect in New Zealand in 1982. Stefano Pampanin, an associate professor at the University of Canterbury who teaches in structural and seismic design, described the non- ductile philosophy as \\"an obsolete design based on the levels of knowledge and code provisions that existed before the mid-1980s\\". The structural design engineer was Alan Reay Consultants (named after the company's owner) and the architect was Alun Wilke Associates Architects, both of which are firms based in Christchurch. Alan Reay in 2014, whose company designed the CTV Building In September 2012 it was discovered the man who supervised the building's construction had faked his engineering degree. Gerald Shirtcliff had stolen the identity of a retired engineer based in the UK, William Fisher. The pair had been friends in the 1960s, and Shirtcliff stole Fisher's degree by adopting his name. It was later discovered Shirtcliff's father had done most of the work on his masters in highway engineering. The CTV Building was inspected by engineers after the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake and after the 26 December 2010 4.9 magnitude aftershock. On both occasions, the building was declared safe, having suffered only superficial damage. The building collapsed in the 22 February 2011 earthquake and, due to its high death toll of over 100 people, has become one of the symbols of the earthquake. The building was owned since 1991 by Madras Equities, a company owned by shareholders Russell Warren Ibbotson and Lionel Walter Hunter. Hunter lost a friend in the building and told a reporter if he had known that there was anything wrong with the building, \\"I would have pushed it over myself.\\" Tenants The building's main tenant was Canterbury Television and the company held the naming rights. CTV occupied the ground and first floors, Levels 1 & 2. The second floor, Level 3, was not tenanted during the quake. King's Education, an English-as-a-second-language school occupied the third floor, Level 4. The Clinic, a medical clinic, was on the fourth floor, Level 5; and the not-for-profit relationship counselling agency Relationship Services\\"About Us\\" , Relationships Aotearoa was on the fifth floor, Level 6. A nursing school was also located in the building. 2011 Christchurch earthquake A Japanese urban search and rescue team at the ruins of the CTV Building The building collapsed in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, with only the north shear wall that included the lift shaft left still standing. One survivor was quoted as running out of the ground floor during the shaking. When she had reached the other side of the 14 meter wide road, she looked back and \\"the building was down.\\" Within minutes, a fire broke out. Most of the deaths were caused by the collapse, but it is assumed that some of the victims suffered fatal burns, and some may have even drowned during the efforts of putting the fire out. King's Education was an ESL school that was located on Level 4 of the CTV building. There were an estimated 87 regular students and 27 visiting students in the building at the time of the earthquake, as well as 17 staff members. Some people had already left the building for lunch when the earthquake struck.King's Education ‚Äì Christchurch New Zealand . Kingseducation.co.nz. Retrieved on 25 April 2011. The loss of hard copy and server records in the earthquake complicated the school's attempts to contact students and next-of-kin; as a last resort, the school decided to post best-known student and staff status and location on the Internet in spite of privacy issues, in an effort to update friends and relatives and to find students who were not accounted for but who were not in the building at the time of its collapse. The disaster received particularly wide coverage in Japan due to 27 of the victims being Japanese.New Zealand police to probe building collapse that killed 115, including 28 Japanese September 2, 2014 Japan Times Retrieved 16 March 2016]Christchurch marks quake, two years on February 22, 2013 Japan Times Retrieved 16 March 2016 The building collapse killed 115 persons, consisting of 16 Canterbury Television employees on Levels 1 & 2; 79 King's Education staff (4), teachers (5) and foreign students (70) on Level 4; 19 medical centre staff (13), patients (5) and one patient's friend on Level 5; and an Administrator for Relationship Services on Level 6. The bodies of four victims in the CTV building could not be identified because the high temperature of the building fire had destroyed any traces of DNA. The inquest into the CTV building deaths was adjourned in September 2011 and resumed in October 2012. This second inquest, continuing until December 2012, paid particular attention to six CTV building victims who were alive for some time but could not be rescued. The follow-up report was completed and released in March 2014 by Coroner Gordon Matenga. Eight victims were identified as making cell phone contact following the building collapse, apparently all affiliated with the King's Education program located on Level 4. Two of the eight died from their injuries early on, but six of them were identified as being injured but alive until the early hours of the next day, when uncontrollable fire, smoke, and further collapse resulted in their deaths. The report is mainly for establishing time and cause of death but is 56 pages long and it includes detailed observations and conclusions from rescuers, administrators, survivors, and friends and family members of several victims, and it includes several recommendations for additional training. Dozens of people survived the collapse of the building. At least 18 staff and patients from Relationship Services on the top level, Level 6, survived the building collapse. Nina Bishop, a Relationship Services administrator, was the only fatality on that level. CTV receptionist Maryanne Jackson was the only person to survive from the ground floor; she did so by running out of the building as the quake struck.  Demolition and land ownership In May 2011 the last remnants of the building, the lift shaft, were demolished. It was announced in July 2013 that the Crown had bought the land for the Eastern Frame, a new park proposed on the east side of the central city. The site was subsequently developed into a garden of remembrance with some elements of the original building foundations still visible.  Royal Commission of Inquiry  The Royal Commission of Inquiry heard evidence into why the CTV Building collapsed during the 2011 earthquake from 25 June 2012, and was scheduled to run for eight weeks. Witnesses before the Commission debated whether the building was code-compliant when it was built, and whether the engineers designing and approving the building had adequate experience. Consulting firm head Alan Reay stated that the building did not meet his own standards, and he thought the engineer he employed for the design, David Harding, had adequate experience. Harding had not designed buildings of more than two floors before. He said he relied on Reay for guidance, and that the developers wanted a minimum-cost design to (just) meet the code; no extra reinforcing was to be added or you \\"got your hand smacked\\". Witness Arthur O‚ÄôLeary, a structural engineer, said that a \\"critical eye\\" should have been cast over the building design. The \\"pioneering\\" structural design could have been beyond the experience of council staff to evaluate, though the \\"pioneering\\" design meant that non-compliant elements in the building columns were not obvious. Panel member Barry Davidson also disagreed with an \\"opportunistic and legalistic\\" interpretation of the code that found they were compliant. The commission's findings were released on 10 December 2012. The report found the building's design was deficient and should not have been approved. The building's engineer, David Harding, of Alan Reay Consultants Ltd, was found to have no experience in designing multi-storey buildings and was \\"working beyond his competence.\\" His supervisor, Alan Reay, left Harding unsupervised then pressured city officials to approve the building design even though several members had reservations about the design.Associated Press/Jiji Press, \\"CTV building collapsed in N.Z. quake poorly designed, built: report\\", Japan Times, 11 December 2012, p. 1 References External links *Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission ‚Äì report into the collapse of the CTV Building :* Translations of section 9 of volume 6 of the report are available in Thai, Korean, Japanese and (simplified) Chinese *Collapse of accountability, an in- depth report on the building's collapse by the New Zealand Listener (September 2014) *Mini-documentary about CTV employees seeing the building collapse in front of them Office buildings completed in 1986 Christchurch Central City Buildings and structures in Christchurch 2011 Christchurch earthquake Mass media company headquarters Collapsed buildings and structures 1980s architecture in New Zealand Buildings and structures demolished as a result of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake ","title":"CTV Building"},{"id":"31469592","text":"Mark Sutcliffe (born 1979) is a British Army soldier.

A natural process by which this channel can occur is a spin chain through which a number of spin states, coupled by a time independent Hamiltonian, can be used to send a quantum state from one location to another. The resulting quantum channel ends up being identical to an amplitude damping channel, for which the quantum capacity, the classical capacity and the entanglement assisted classical capacity of the quantum channel can be evaluated. Qubit Channel The amplitude-damping channel models energy relaxation from an excited state to the ground state. On a two-dimensional system, or qubit, with decay probability gamma, the channel's action on a density matrix rho is given by :{cal N}_gamma(rho) = K_0 rho K_0^dagger + K_1 rho K_1^dagger;, where K_0, K_1 are the Kraus operators given by :K_0 = begin{pmatrix}1&00&sqrt{1-gamma}end{pmatrix}, ; K_1 = begin{pmatrix}0&sqrt{gamma}0&0end{pmatrix};. Thus :{cal N}_gammaleft[begin{pmatrix}rho_{00}&rho_{01}rho_{10}&rho_{11}end{pmatrix}right] = begin{pmatrix}rho_{00} + gamma rho_{11} & sqrt{1-gamma} rho_{01}  sqrt{1-gamma} rho_{10} & (1-gamma) rho_{11}end{pmatrix};. Model for a Spin Chain Quantum Channel The main construct of the quantum channel based on spin chain correlations is to have a collection of N coupled spins. At either side of the quantum channel, there are two groups of spins and we refer to these as quantum registers, A and B. A message is sent by having the sender of the message encode some information on register A, and then, after letting it propagate over some time t, having the receiver later retrieve it from B. The state rho_{A} is prepared on A by first decoupling the spins on A from those on the remainder of the chain. After preparation, rho_{A} is allowed to interact with the state on the remainder of the chain, which initially has the state sigma_{0}. The state of the spin chain as time progresses can be described by R(t) = U(t)(rho_{A} otimes sigma_{0})U^{dagger}(t). From this relationship we can obtain the state of the spins belonging to register B by tracing away all other states of the chain. rho_B(t)= mbox{Tr}^{(B)} [ U(t) (rho_A otimes sigma_0) U^{dagger}(t)] This gives the mapping below, which describes how the state on A is transformed as a function of time as it is transmitted over the quantum channel to B. U(t) is just some unitary matrix which describes the evolution of the system as a function of time. rho_A rightarrow mathcal{M}(rho_A ) equiv rho_B(t)= mbox{Tr}^{(B)} [ U(t) (rho_A otimes sigma_0) U^{dagger}(t)] There are, however, a few issues with this description of the quantum channel. One of the assumptions involved with using such a channel is that we expect that the states of the chain are not disturbed. While it may be possible for a state to be encoded on A without disturbing the chain, a reading of the state from B will influence the states of the rest of the spin chain. Thus, any repeated manipulation of the registers A and B will have an unknown impact on the quantum channel. Given this fact, solving the capacities of this mapping would not be generally useful, since it will only apply when several copies of the chain are operating in parallel. In order to calculate meaningful values for these capacities, the simple model below allows for the capacities to be solved exactly. =Solvable Model= A spin chain, which is composed of a chain of particles with spin 1/2 coupled through a ferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction, is used, and is described by the Hamiltonian: H=-sum_{langle i,j rangle} hbar J_{ij} left({sigma}_x^{i}{sigma}_x^{j} +{sigma}_y^{i}{sigma}_y^{j}+gamma {sigma}_z^{i}{sigma}_z^{j}right)-sum_{i=1}^{N} hbar B_i sigma_z^{i} It is assumed that the input register, A and the output register B occupy the first k and last k spins along the chain, and that all spins along the chain are prepared to be in the spin down state in the z direction. The parties then use all k of their spin states to encode/decode a single qubit. The motivation for this method is that if all k spins were allowed to be used, we would have a k-qubit channel, which would be too complex to be completely analyzed. Clearly, a more effective channel would make use of all k spins, but by using this inefficient method, it is possible to look at the resulting maps analytically. To carry out the encoding of a single bit using the k available bits, a one-spin up vector is defined j rangle , in which all spins are in the spin down state except for the j-th one, which is in the spin up state.  { j}rangle equiv leftdownarrow downarrow cdots downarrow uparrow downarrow cdots downarrow rightrangle The sender prepares his set of k input spins as: Psirangle_A equiv alpha leftDownarrowrightrangle_A + betaphi_1 rangle_A where leftDownarrowrightrangle is the state where all positions have spin down, and phi_1 rangle is the superposition of all possible one-spin up states. Using this input, it is possible to find a state which describes the whole chain at a given time t. From such a state, tracing out the N-k spins not belonging to the receiver, as we would have done with the earlier model, leaves the state on B: rho_B(t) = (alpha^2 + (1-eta) beta^2) left Downarrow rightrangle_Bleftlangle Downarrow right + eta beta^2 phi_1^{prime}rangle_B langle phi_1^{prime}+ sqrt{eta} alpha beta^* left Downarrow rightrangle_Blangle phi_1^{prime}  + sqrt{eta} alpha^* beta  phi_1^{prime} rangle_Bleftlangle Downarrow right where eta is a constant defining the efficiency of the channel. If we represent the states in which one spin is up to be 1 rangle and those where all spins are down to be  0 rangle , this becomes recognizable as the result of applying the amplitude damping channel mathcal{D}_n , characterized by the following Kraus operators: A_0 = 0ranglelangle 0 +sqrt{eta}1rangle langle 1 ; A_1 = sqrt{1-eta}0rangle langle 1 Evidently, the fact that an amplitude damping channel describes the transmission of quantum states across the spin chain stems from the fact that Hamiltonian of the system conserves energy. While energy can be spread out as the one-spin up state is transferred along the chain, it is not possible for spins in the down state to suddenly gain energy and become spin up states.  Capacities of the Amplitude Damping Channel  By describing the spin-chain as an amplitude damping channel, it is possible to calculate the various capacities associated with the channel. One useful property of this channel, which is used to find these capacities, is the fact that two amplitude damping channels with efficiencies eta and eta' can be concatenated. Such a concatenation gives a new channel of efficiency etaeta'. =Quantum Capacity= In order to calculate the quantum capacity, the map mathcal{D}_eta is represented as follows: mathcal{D}_eta (rho) equiv mbox{Tr}_C [ V left( rho otimes 0 rangle_C langle 0 right) V^{dagger}];. This representation of the map is obtained by adding an auxiliary Hilbert space mathcal{H}_C to that of mathcal{H}_A . and introducing an operator V which operates on A and C. A complementary channel, tilde{mathcal{D}}_eta is also defined, where instead of tracing over C, we trace over A. A swapping operation S which transforms A into C is defined. Using this operation, as well as the rule for concatenation of amplitude damping channels, it is shown that for eta geqslant 0.5: tilde{mathcal{D}}_eta (rho) = S mathcal{D}_{(1-eta)/eta} left({mathcal{D}}_{eta} (rho)right);. This relationship demonstrates that the channel is degradable, which guarantees that the coherent information of the channel is additive. This implies that the quantum capacity is achieved for a single channel use. An amplitude damping mapping is applied to a general input state, and from this mapping, the von Neumann entropy of the output is found as: S(mathcal{D}_{eta} (rho)) = H_2 (left(1 + sqrt{(1- 2,eta, p)^2 + 4,eta, gamma^2} right)/2);, where pin[0,1] with state 1 rangle and gammaleqslant sqrt{(1-p)p} is a coherence term. By looking at a purification of the state, it is found that: S((mathcal{D}_{eta} otimes1_{anc}) (Phi)) = H_2 (left(1 + sqrt{(1- 2,(1-eta), p)^2 + 4,(1-eta), gamma^2} right)/2) In order to maximize the quantum capacity, we choose that gamma = 0 (due to concavity of entropy, which yields the following as the quantum capacity: Q equiv max_{pin[0,1]} ; Big{ ; H_2 (eta, p) - H_2((1-eta), p); Big}; Finding the quantum capacity for eta < 0.5 is straightforward, as the quantum capacity vanishes as a direct result of the no-cloning theorem. The fact that channels can be composed in this fashion implies that quantum capacity of the channel must increase as a function of eta. =Entanglement Assisted Classical Capacity= To calculate the entanglement assisted capacity we must maximize the quantum mutual information. This is found by adding the input entropy of the message to the derived coherent information in the previous section. It is again maximized for gamma = 0. Thus, the entanglement assisted classical capacity is found to be C_E equiv max_{pin[0,1]} ; Big{ ; H_2( p) + H_2 (eta, p) - H_2((1-eta), p); Big}; =Classical Capacity= We now calculate C1, which is the maximum amount of classical information that can be transmitted by non-entangled encodings over parallel channel uses. This quantity acts as a lower bound for the classical capacity, C. To find C1, the classical capacity is maximized for n=1. We consider an ensemble of messages, each with probability xi_{k}. The Holevo information is found to be: chi equiv H_2 left(frac{1 + sqrt{(1- 2 ,eta,p)^2 +4 ,eta, gamma^2}}{2} right)-sum_k xi_k H_2 left(frac{1 + sqrt{(1- 2 ,eta,p_k)^2 +4 ,eta, gamma_k^2}}{2} right); In this expression, p_k and gamma_k are the population and a coherence term, as defined before, and p and gamma are the average values of these. In order to find C1, first an upper bound is found for C1, and then a set of p_k,gamma_k,xi_k are found that satisfy this bound. As before, gamma is set to be 0 in order to maximize the first term of Holevo information. From here we use the fact that the binary entropy H_2(z) is decreasing with respect to 1/2 + z as well as the fact that H_2(1 + sqrt{1-z^2}/2) is convex with respect to z to find the following inequality: sum_k xi_k H_2 left(frac{1 + sqrt{(1- 2 ,eta,p_k)^2+4 ,eta, gamma_k^2}}{2} right) geqslant H_2 left(frac{1 + sqrt{1- 4 ,eta,(1-eta) (sum_k xi_k p_k)^2}}{2} right) By maximizing over all choices of p, the following upper bound for C1 is found: C_1 leqslant max_{pin[0,1]} Big{ H_2 left(eta , p right)- H_2 left(frac{1 + sqrt{1- 4 ,eta,(1-eta) ,p ^2}}{2} right) Big} ; This upper bound is found to be the value for C1, and the parameters that realize this bound are xi_k=1/d ,!, p_k=p ,!, and gamma_k=e^{2pi i k/d} sqrt{(1-p)p} . =Numerical Analysis of the Capacities= From the expressions for the various capacities, it is possible to carry out a numerical analysis on them. For an eta of 1, the three capacities are maximized, which leads to the quantum and classical capacities both being 1, and the Entanglement assisted classical capacity being 2. As mentioned earlier, the quantum capacity is 0 for any eta less than 0.5, while the classical capacity and the entanglement assisted classical capacity reach 0 for eta of 0. When eta is less than 0.5, too much information is lost to the environment for quantum information to be sent to the receiving party. Effectiveness of Spin-Chains as a Quantum Communication Channel Having calculated the capacities for the amplitude damping channel as a function of the efficiency of the channel, it is possible to analyze the effectiveness of such a channel as a function of distance between the encoding site and the decoding site. Bose demonstrated that the efficiency drops as a function of r-s^{-2/3}, where r is the position of the decoding and s is the position of encoding. Due to the fact that the quantum capacity vanishes for eta less than 0.5, this means that the distance between the sender and the receiver must be very short in order for any quantum information to be transmitted. Therefore, long spin chains are not suitable to transmit quantum information. Future Study Possibilities for future study in this field would include methods whereby spin-chain interactions could be used as a more effective channel. This would include the optimization of the values of eta by looking more closely at the interaction between the spins, and choosing interactions which have a positive effect on the efficiency. Such an optimization could allow for more effective transmission of quantum data over distance. An alternative to this would be to split the chain into smaller segments, and to use a large number of spin chains to transmit quantum data. This would be effective since the spin chains are themselves good at transmitting quantum data short distances. On top of this, it would be possible to increase the quantum capacity by allowing for free two way classical communication between the sender and receiver and making use of quantum effects such as quantum teleportation. Other areas of study would include an analysis for an encoding that makes use of the full k spins of the registers, as this would allow for more information to be communicated at a time.

There are also problems of privacy when confidential information is lost or intercepted, lawfully or otherwise. On the global level, both governments and non-state actors continue to grow in importance, with the ability to engage in such activities as espionage, and other cross-border attacks sometimes referred to as cyber warfare. The international legal system is attempting to hold actors accountable for their actions, with the International Criminal Court among the few addressing this threat.Ophardt, Jonathan A. \\"Cyber warfare and the crime of aggression: the need for individual accountability on tomorrow's battlefield\\" Duke Law and Technology Review, February 23, 2010 A cyber countermeasure is defined as an action, process, technology, device, or system that serves to prevent or mitigate the effects of a cyber attack against a victim, computer, server, network or associated device. Recently there has been an increase in the number of international cyber attacks. In 2013 there was a 91% increase in targeted attack campaigns and a 62% increase in security breaches. A number of countermeasures exist that can be effectively implemented in order to combat cyber-crime and increase security. Types of threats =Malicious code= Malicious code is a broad category that encompasses a number of threats to cyber-security. In essence it is any ‚Äúhardware, software, or firmware that is intentionally included or inserted in a system for a harmful purpose.‚ÄùNewman, R. (2006) Cybercrime, Identity Theft, and Fraud: Practicing Safe Internet ‚Äì Network Security Threats and Vulnerabilities. Proceedings of the 3rd Annual Conference on Information Security Curriculum Development. Kennesaw, GA: ACM. p. 69. Commonly referred to as malware it includes computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, keyloggers, BOTs, Rootkits, and any software security exploits. Malicious code also includes spyware, which are deceptive programs, installed without authorization, ‚Äúthat monitor a consumer‚Äôs activities without their consent.‚ÄùLoibl, T. (2005) Identity Theft, Spyware, and the Law. Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Conference on Information Security Curriculum Development. Kennesaw, GA: ACM. p. 119. Spyware can be used to send users unwanted popup ads, to usurp the control of a user‚Äôs Internet browser, or to monitor a user‚Äôs online habits. However, spyware is usually installed along with something that the user actually wishes to install. The user consents to the installation, but does not consent to the monitoring tactics of the spyware. The consent for spyware is normally found in the end-user license agreement. akua AB =Network attacks= A network attack is considered to be any action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information residing on a computer and computer networks. An attack can take four forms: fabrication, interception, interruption, and modification. A fabrication is the ‚Äúcreation of some deception in order to deceive some unsuspecting user‚Äù; an interception is the ‚Äúprocess of intruding into some transmission and redirecting it for some unauthorized use‚Äù; an interruption is the ‚Äúbreak in a communication channel, which inhibits the transmission of data‚Äù; and a modification is ‚Äúthe alteration of the data contained in the transmissions.‚Äù Attacks can be classified as either being active or passive. Active attacks involve modification of the transmission or attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system, while passive attacks involve monitoring transmissions. Either form can be used to obtain information about a user, which can later be used to steal that user‚Äôs identity. Common forms of network attacks include Denial of Service (Dos) and Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS), Man-in-the-middle attack, packet sniffing, TCP SYN Flood, ICMP Flood, IP spoofing, and even simple web defacement. =Network abuse= Network abuses are activities which violate a network's acceptable use policy and are generally considered fraudulent activity that is committed with the aid of a computer. SPAM is one of the most common forms of network abuse, where an individual will email list of users usually with unsolicited advertisements or phishing attacks attempting to use social engineering to acquire sensitive information such any information useful in identity theft, usernames, passwords, and so on by posing as a trustworthy individual. Pharming is also another form of network abuse where a website‚Äôs traffic is redirected to a bogus website, usually by exploiting vulnerabilities in Domain Name System(DNS) servers. =Social engineering= Social engineering is the act of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information, rather than by breaking in or using technical cracking techniques. This method of deception is commonly used by individuals attempting to break into computer systems, by posing as an authoritative or trusted party and capturing access information from the naive target. Email Phishing is a common example of social engineering's application, but it is not limited to this single type of attack. =Technical= There are a variety of different technical countermeasures that can be deployed to thwart cybercriminals and harden systems against attack. Firewalls, network or host based, are considered the first line of defense in securing a computer network by setting Access Control Lists (ACLs) determining which what services and traffic can pass through the check point.Firewall http://www.tech-faq.com/firewall.html Antivirus can be used to prevent propagation of malicious code. Most computer viruses have similar characteristics which allow for signature based detection. Heuristics such as file analysis and file emulation are also used to identify and remove malicious programs. Virus definitions should be regularly updated in addition to applying operating system hotfixes, service packs, and patches to keep computers on a network secure. Cryptography techniques can be employed to encrypt information using an algorithm commonly called a cipher to mask information in storage or transit. Tunneling for example will take a payload protocol such as Internet Protocol (IP) and encapsulate it in an encrypted delivery protocol over a Virtual Private Network (VPN), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), or Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)to ensure data security during transmission. Encryption can also be employed on the file level using encryption protocols like Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES, or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to ensure security of information in storage. Additionally, network vulnerability testing performed by technicians or automated programs can be used to test on a full-scale or targeted specifically to devices, systems, and passwords used on a network to assess their degree of secureness. Furthermore, network monitoring tools can be used to detect intrusions or suspicious traffic on both large and small networks. Physical deterrents such as locks, card access keys, or biometric devices can be used to prevent criminals from gaining physical access to a machine on a network. Strong password protection both for access to a computer system and the computer's BIOS are also effective countermeasures to against cyber-criminals with physical access to a machine. Another deterrent is to use a bootable bastion host that executes a web browser in a known clean and secure operating environment. The host is devoid of any known malware, where data is never stored on the device, and the media cannot be overwritten. The kernel and programs are guaranteed to be clean at each boot. Some solutions have been used to create secure hardware browsers to protect users while accessing online banking. Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition The Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition (CT-SNAIR) project uses the Terrorist Action Description Language (TADL) to model and simulate terrorist networks and attacks. It also models links identified in communication patterns compiled from multimedia data, and terrorists‚Äô activity patterns are compiled from databases of past terrorist threats.Weinstein, C., et al. (2009) Modeling and Detection Techniques for Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition. Proceedings from the Aerospace Conference. Piscataway, NJ: IEEE. p. 2. Unlike other proposed methods, CT-SNAIR constantly interacts with the user, who uses the system both to investigate and to refine hypotheses. Multimedia data, such as voice, text, and network session data, is compiled and processed. Through this compilation and processing, names, entities, relationships, and individual events are extracted from the multimedia data. This information is then used to perform a social network analysis on the criminal network, through which the user can detect and track threats in the network. The social network analysis directly influences and is influenced by the intent recognition process, in which the user can recognize and detect threats. In the CT-SNAIR process, data and transactions from prior attacks, or forensic scenarios, is compiled to form a sequential list of transactions for a given terrorism scenario. The CT-SNAIR process also includes generating data from hypothetical scenarios. Since they are imagined and computer-generated, hypothetical scenarios do not have any transaction data representing terrorism scenarios. Different types of transactions combine to represent the types of relationships between individuals. The final product, or target social network, is a weighted multiplex graph in which the types of edges (links) are defined by the types of transactions within the social network.Weinstein, C., et al. (2009) Modeling and Detection Techniques for Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition. Proceedings from the Aerospace Conference. Piscataway, NJ: IEEE. p. 7. The weights within these graphs are determined by the content-extraction algorithm, in which each type of link is thought of as a separate graph and ‚Äúis fed into social network algorithms in part or as a whole.‚Äù Links between two individuals can be determined by the existence of (or lack of) the two people being mentioned within the same sentence in the compiled multimedia data or in relation to the same group or event.Weinstein, C., et al. (2009) Modeling and Detection Techniques for Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition. Proceedings from the Aerospace Conference. Piscataway, NJ: IEEE. p. 8. The final component in the CT-SNAIR process is Intent Recognition (IR). The goal of this component is to indicate to an analyst the threats that a transaction stream might contain.Weinstein, C., et al. (2009) Modeling and Detection Techniques for Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition. Proceedings from the Aerospace Conference. Piscataway, NJ: IEEE. p. 10. Intent Recognition breaks down into three subcategories: detection of ‚Äúknown or hypothetical target scenarios,‚Äù prioritization of these target scenarios, and interpretation ‚Äúof the resulting detection.‚Äù =Economic= The optimal level of cyber-security depends largely on the incentives facing providers and the incentives facing perpetrators. Providers make their decision based on the economic payoff and cost of increased security whereas perpetrators decisions are based on the economic gain and cost of cyber-crime. Potential prisoner‚Äôs dilemma, public goods, and negative externalities become sources of cyber- security market failure when private returns to security are less than the social returns. Therefore, the higher the ratio of public to private benefit the stronger the case for enacting new public policies to realign incentives for actors to fight cyber-crime with increased investment in cyber-security. =Legal= In the United States a number of legal statutes define and detail the conditions for prosecution of a cyber-crime and are used not only as a legal counter-measure, but also functions as a behavioral check against the commission of a cyber-crime. Many of the provisions outlined in these acts overlap with each. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act passed in 1986 is one of the broadest statutes in the US used to combat cyber-crime. It has been amended a number of times, most recently by the US Patriot Act of 2002 and the Identity theft enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008.

Description Leuenbergeria bleo grows as a shrub or small tree and reaches a height of 2 to 8 metres with trunks up to 15 centimetres in diameter. The olive-green to brownish grey branches are smooth. The leaves are arranged alternately on the branches and are distinctly stalked with petioles up to 3 centimetres long. The leaf blade is 6 to 20 centimetres long and 2 to 7 centimetres wide, elliptic to oblong or lanceolate in shape. The five nerved leaf blades have four to six, often fork-shaped, side lobes. The thorns are either parallel in bundles or spread widely out. Long thorns on the branches are up to five to ten millimetres long. Along the main shoots there are up to 40 spines per areole, each 2 centimetres long. The flowers are arranged in terminal lateral inflorescences. The bare, bright red, scarlet, salmon pink and orange-red-pink flowers reach diameters of 4 to 6 centimeters. The fruits are conical, truncated in the apex, ripening yellow. They are edible but sour tasting. Taxonomy The first description of the species, as Cactus bleo, was in 1828 by Karl Sigismund Kunth. Distribution and habitat Pereskia bleo is found by rivers and streams in Panama and Colombia as well as in secondary forest, from sea level to altitudes of 1300 metres.

Opiate abuse was uncommon until the 1980s, following events in the opium production centres of Afghanistan and Iran. Government task forces and private programmes were formed to tackle increased opiate abuse. Dublin and Ballymena have been centres of increased heroin use and preventative efforts. Studies confirmed significant opiate use in the 1990s, when action to reduce harm caused by drug use became favoured. Programmes focussed on controlling the spread of HIV, seen as a greater social threat than drug abuse itself. Heroin =1970s= Heroin use in Ireland has always centred on Dublin, and to a lesser extent Cork city. Heroin abuse became a major problem in inner- city Dublin in the late 1970s. Earlier, there was no evidence of anything more than isolated use of heroin. In December 1968, the Minister for Health, Se√°n Flanagan, established a working party to investigate the extent of drug abuse at the time and to advise the government. Their research, reported in 1971,Report of working party on drug abuse. Irish Government Stationery Office; 1971. could not find any evidence of significant use of heroin, which they attributed to the difficulty of obtaining supplies at the time. Drug use was limited mostly to cannabis and LSD. These drugs were seen as part of student sub-culture; Dr. Hugh Byrne, a TD debating what was to be the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act, described Trinity College Dublin as \\"a nest and a hive for the production of LSD [...] leaflets containing the formula of LSD have been freely sold around the campus\\". He blamed this activity on foreign students in areas of \\"advanced study\\".D√°il debates, 1975. Volume 278, 20 February, Column 938 The main treatment centre for drug users was at Jervis Street Hospital. The National Drug Advisory and treatment Centre was founded there in 1969. In 1973, the Coolmine therapeutic community was founded as a voluntary body to provide a structure for people to \\"maintain a drug-free existence\\".Coolmine Therapeutic Community In 1979, there was a dramatic increase in the supply of heroin to Western Europe, usually attributed to the fall of the Shah in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This marked the start of an epidemic in inner-city Dublin. =1980s= The number of heroin users in Dublin continued to grow in the early 1980s. The 1983 Bradshaw Report found that in north central Dublin, 10% of 15- to 24-year-olds had used heroin in the previous year; the figure was 12% for 15- to 19-year-olds, and 13% for females of the same age group. The report also confirmed Dublin as a centre for heroin use, with only three or four heroin users in Cork and Galway.Bradshaw J, Dean G. Drug misuse in Ireland, 1982‚Äì1983: investigation in a north central Dublin area, and in Galway, Sligo, and Cork. The Medico-Social Research Board; 1983. Following this report, the government created a Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse in April 1983. Their report recommended funding community facilities in deprived areas, but this was at odds with government policy at the time, so the report went unpublished. The government's position was that drug abusers were victims of their own choices, rather than their socio-economic circumstances.Butler S. Drug problems and drug policies in Ireland: a quarter of a century reviewed. Administration. 1991;39(3):210{235. The Misuse of Drugs Act 1984 was enacted to provide for tougher punishments than the 1977 Act. The 1980s also saw the rise of community groups which organised themselves to rid their local areas of drugs. Priests, politicians and even Provisional IRA members took part in residents' associations in areas of Dublin such as Fatima Mansions, the Hardwicke Street flats, St. Teresa's Gardens, and Dolphin House. Groups met to name and shame drug dealers, giving them the choice either to stop dealing or leave the area. Actions broadened to include patrols by residents, checkpoints to search vehicles for drugs, forced evictions, and other vigilante actions. These local groups got together and adopted a constitution in February 1984, naming themselves \\"Concerned Parents Against Drugs\\". The Drug Treatment Centre Board moved to Trinity Court in 1988 following the closure of Jervis Street hospital. The most significant event of the decade was the arrival of the HIV/AIDS epidemic to Ireland. The first diagnosed case of AIDS was in 1982. Early cases before 1987 were found in homosexual men, this soon spread to intravenous drug users, overtaking cases amongst homosexual men.O'Kelly FD. The natural history of injecting drug use in a Dublin community (1985-1995) [MD thesis]; 2000. Department of Community Health and General Practice, Trinity College, University of Dublin. A survey by the Department of Health in 1986 found that 30% of intravenous drug users were HIV positive. =1990s= There were an estimated 13,460 opiate users in Ireland in 1996. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ireland was most active among intravenous drug users. Treatment in centres such as Trinity Court required a commitment from the patient to achieve abstinence from drugs. In light of the HIV epidemic, this policy was revised in 1992 to one of harm reduction. This different approach recognised that the harms of drug use, such as the spread of HIV, were of a greater danger to society than drug use itself.National Advisory Committee on Drugs, the National Drugs Strategy Team. Needle exchange provision in Ireland; 2008. Harm reduction was implemented in the form of methadone maintenance and needle exchange programmes.

Following this legislation, the number of head shops declined dramatically from 112 to just 12.Irish Times - Minister seeks to ban more products sold in head shops (5 October 2011) = 2015 legislation = Before a Government order took effect in 2011, head shops had been legally selling methylethcathinone, a recreational drug. Earlier Government orders, also pursuant to the Misuse of Drugs Act, outlawed the possession of other head shop drugs like ecstasy and magic mushrooms. Stanislav Bederev, charged with methylethcathinone possession in 2012, challenged the constitutionality of such Government orders. On 10 March 2015, the Court of Appeal ruled in Bederev's favour, on the basis that the orders amounted to law-making, a power reserved for the Oireachtas. Emergency legislation to reinstate the ban on drugs previously banned by Government orders, which also include amphetamine, khat and ketamine, took effect on 12 March 2015.RTE.IE news report 10/03/15 The Court of Appeal ruling implicated pending cases involving possession of those drugs, and may potentially have led to appeals from those previously convicted of possession of those drugs. However, in June 2016, the Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal's ruling, finding the original Government orders constitutional, on the basis that the Government was bound to outlaw only drugs of the same nature as those already listed in the Misuse of Drugs Act, and that the Oireachtas was given the right to annul the Government's orders if the Oireachtas so chose.

Facts Ms Frances Mary Cope had bought a flat in a refurbished housing block, Kilner House Clayton St, London SE11 5SE, that had been owned by the Greater London Council until the Conservative Party began its right to buy policy of privatising council housing. Estmanco (Kilner House) Ltd was set up to hold properties, and allot to each buyer a share, but with the GLC retaining all voting rights until the last flat was sold. Then the Labour Party won the election, and halted the privatisation policy. Ms Cope requested permission to bring a derivative claim for herself and other people who had bought their flats, alleging that the directors (now effectively the Labour administration of the GLC) breached their duty to act for proper purposes. Judgment Sir Robert Megarry VC held that the derivative claim could continue, and the Greater London Council could not use its voting power to permanently prevent other shareholders acquiring voting rights, as that would undermine the purpose for which the company was formed.

The airfoil was altered from the stock Wortmann FX 61-163 to simplify construction, even at the cost of some measure of performance. The construction of the airframe was modified to eliminate the use of pop rivets and the structure and assembly requirements were simplified. The flap and flight control systems were also redesigned. Bikle also developed the T-tail, installing it in place of the HP-14's V-tail. The T-6 is named for Bikle's competition number \\"6\\" and the T-tailed design of the aircraft.

It is known from the site of Karydia, assigned to the biostratigraphical zone MN 4; similar fossils have been found at an approximately contemporary Czech site and a slightly younger Greek site. With characters like the presence of a hypocone (fourth cusp) on the upper third premolar, the presence of a connection between the protocone and metaconule cusps on the second upper molar in only a few specimens, this species is intermediate between the slightly older Galerix symeonidisi and the slightly younger Parasorex pristinus. It may form part of the lineage leading from the genus Galerix to the younger genus Parasorex. Taxonomy and range Galerix kostakii was first described in 2006 by Greek and Dutch paleontologists Constantin Doukas and Lars van den Hoek Ostende from the Greek paleontological site of Karydia. The specific name, kostakii, honors Constantin \\"Kostaki\\" Theocharopoulos, who studied the cricetid rodents found at Karydia. Karydia is dated to the mammal zone MN 4 (late early Miocene). Galerix kostakii dominates the insectivore fauna of Karydia, forming 60% of the total fauna. In contrast, at Aliveri, a slightly older Greek site also assigned to MN 4, Galerix (represented by the related species Galerix symeonidisi) forms only about 25% of the insectivore fauna. The reason for this difference is unknown. In Komotini, a slightly younger site (assigned to zone MN 5) near Karydia, a single first upper molar (M1) of an unidentified Galerix species similar to G. kostakii has been found. In the Czech region of Mokr√°, at a site known as \\"Mokr√° ‚Äì 1/2001 Turtle Joint\\" (MN 4), a few fossils of a Galerix very similar to G. kostakii have been found. Description and relationships Unlike most species of the genus Galerix, G. kostakii has a fourth cusp, the hypocone, on its upper third premolar (P3). Galerix symeonidisi and Galerix iliensis also have this cusp, but are smaller and larger, respectively, than G. kostakii. In addition, G. kostakii differs from G. symeonidisi in that a connection between the protocone and metaconule cusps of M2 is more rarely present and the back arm of the metaconule always reaches the back corner of the tooth. Members of the related genus Parasorex are similar, but never have a protocone-metaconule connection, which is still occasionally present in G. kostakii. The primitive Parasorex species Parasorex pristinus is about as large as G. kostakii, but its molars are narrower, the first lower premolar (p4) is smaller, and the metacone cusp on M2 has a straight anterior arm. Furthermore, Galerix kostakii lacks the paralophid on p4, a crest that connects the paraconid and protoconid cusps. Galerix kostakii shares some of the features present in Parasorex and Schizogalerix, both derived descendants of Galerix, including the presence of a hypocone on P3, a partitioned posterior cingulum on m1 and m2, and the absence of the protocone-metaconule connection in most M1 and M2. However, it also retains primitive, Galerix-like features, including the condition of p4 and the presence of a protocone-metaconule connection in some specimens. Galerix kostakii may be part of a lineage that led from the slightly more primitive G. symeonidisi through G. kostakii to Parasorex pristinus, the oldest species of its genus, and then to the other Parasorex species. This lineage may have evolved these traits, which may be adaptations to a herbivorous diet, convergently with Schizogalerix, which appears earlier in the fossil record.

Esthappan's story unfolds through narrations of other fishermen about the miracles created by him. Through the contradictory statements of these people, a mystical figure of Esthappan unfolds. The first sequence of Esthappan is a long shot of Esthappan walking by the seashore, which creates an illusory feeling that he is walking over the waves and crossing the sea. Esthappan's miraculous acts like printing his own money and drinking whisky without getting drunk are narrated by people. He is described as a prophet, miraculous healer, thief and charlatan by different people. Finally when the disappearance of Esthappan from the colony creates concern among fellow fishermen, the priest of the church consoles them that Esthappan would definitely come back. Critical Commentary The character of Esthappan is always engaged in all sorts of things (in a moral way) to make people remind of Christ. At the sea shore and on the walls he draws pictures of Christ. It is evident after the homily given by the priest that the film gives importance to act besides belief. This very thing acts as the manifesto of the film Esthappan. The fishermen community of the place works (different sorts of ‚Äòacts‚Äô) so hard and so do all other men and women of the locality. Yet the greatness of their acts is lost once the same community indulges without any moral concerns, in immoral and illegal acts. They lose the greatness of their effort (acts) through excessive drinking, gossiping, being promiscuous and through exploiting each other in many ways. This reprobate state of the people is what drives Esthappan to do what he does. He, who was once a fisherman now does no work other than doing things that will remind the people of Christ. He thinks that to work without a philosophy, is a waste. Therefore, his attempt is at the heart of the people who have forgotten Christ. In order to do that he comes to help people from diseases, from false acquisitions, from debt, from dangers etc. like Christ did. But his constant worries and thoughts while doing all these suggest us that he is not satisfied from these external acts alone. He is worried more about getting into the hearts of people where lay the real problem; the question of morality and conscience. Esthappan is not against established dogmas of the Church or against the practices of her. His attendance of mass celebrated in the church and his asking for the incenses are examples for this. The audience come to know about Esthappan solely through the narration of different characters. Though for most part Esthappan is doing benevolent deeds he is seen by some as a trickster. Sometimes people talk about him in hostile tones. However those who directly received the goodness of his deeds, like the children and women, talk nicely about him. The reason why others talk ill of Esthappan is that either he does things that they are not capable of (for which they are jealous) or because they basically are immoral to accept someone‚Äôs good deeds. He can be seen doing a deathlike act which he himself clears as a sleep-act (Like Christ‚Äôs death on the cross) that might be to suggest that Christ was made to sleep by the same people for which He came and that He is not dead but still lives even on the cross. The inability of Esthappan in completely representing Christ stems from the vastness of Christ‚Äôs infinite nature. This is reflected in the disillusions and restlessness of the finite character Esthappan. The final image of Esthappan accompanied with the death toll seems like to suggest that he finally lost in his attempt to redraw the attention of the people toward Christ.

Aravindan. Nedumudi Venu, Sreenivasan, Thilakan, Vineeth, Krishnankutty Nair, Chandran Nair and Soorya form the cast. The story is about the problems faced by the people of a hamlet where electricity in unavailable, when electric supply finally reaches there. The film reaches a conclusion that life is better without electricity. The indefinability of the human mind is the theme of the film. Though the film is discussing a serious issue, the treatment of it is very simplistic. Humour and intensity characterise the film that is set in the mid-fifties. The film is different from many of Aravindan's earlier works in that it deals with a broad range of characters and lacks a clear-cut linear story., p.? It became a major critical success and earned the best director awards for Aravindan at state and national film awards. Plot The time is the mid-fifties, when the Indian states were being reorganised. The place is a remote village in Kerala. There is a palpable hum of excitement as the village Panchayath, led by the Brahmin landlord, is determined to bring the benefits of electricity to this backward place. As the story unfolds, it introduces us to an array of characters in the village...the Communist tailor given to fiery speeches, laced with quotations; the landlord's bossy manager; Kuttan, the odd job man, hitching his star to the influential newcomers; the wise school teacher, the adolescent boy and girl; the braggarl overseer... Families and groups are deftly sketched with a cartoonist's sharp eye. Each group has its own story to tell, in self-contained episodes that are all interrelated. The vela or the festival of the local temple is a symbol of the harmony that prevailed in the village in those pre-electricity days. After the executive engineer from the Electricity Department has surveyed the place with becoming solemnity, there follows a flurry of activity. The overseer, flatteringly called engineer by the villagers who do not know the distinction, has an eye for the girls. Kuttan, the man for all jobs, becomes the overseer's faithful servitor. He induces the girl he hopes to marry to join the electricity workforce. A doctor following in the wake of electricity sets up a dispensary in the village. Kuttan decides he is a more prestigious master to serve. The village soon stops treating the overseer with awe. He displays a taste for the arts and theatricals, forms an amateur group and earnestly begins rehearsing for a romantic play about separated lovers. Young Jose plays the heroine's role. Jose is a bright, ambitious boy who plans to leave the village to work outside Kerala, once the coming festival is over. The disenchantment with electricity is gradual. The location of the electric pole makes old friends and neighbours fall out. There are dire omens of death. At first, crows are electrocuted atop the wire, then a cow fallen in a huddle. Death also comes to Kuttan's girlfriend who is pregnant. Kuttan cannot afford to support her, and abortion seems the only way out. Next morning, her dead body is found in the temple pond. The doctor, who has finalised marriage negotiations with the manager's daughter is unmasked - as a quack and a would- be bigamist to boot. Kuttan's simple trust is betrayed by the overseer who seduces his sister. Before the larger calamity strikes, there is a symbolic burial of the beautiful temple lamppost, whose wick was ceremonially lit every evening. Its gentle glow has now been replaced by harsh electric glare. The story moves inexorably to its culmination. At the temple festival every year, Kuttan traditionally dons the vestments of the Kali, the avenging goddess. He decides to wreak vengeance on the overseer who he sees as the root cause of all calamities in the village. But in the clash, it is young Jose, who gets electrocuted. The cry of the innocent victim is drowned by the pyrotechnical dazzle of the festival fireworks, which are sparked off in the melee ‚Äî a parable of nuclear holocaust. The frame freezes on a parachuting mannikin headed for the earth, arms outsretcged as if in crucifixion.

The The film talks about the arrival of modernization in a typical rural setting of early Kerala in the form of electricity. The entire film thus focuses on the cultural shock and the positive as well as the negative changes brought by it. In the film we often see a light-stand that stands as a recurring motif to suggest the fading of great heritages. The movie portrays all kinds of impoverishment that prevailed in Kerala in her early days. The executive engineer‚Äôs speech in English to an uneducated group of villagers shows how boastful early educated men were. Many of the youth represent joblessness. It is the subservience of the low class people to the high class people that is shown in a greater degree throughout the film, even as that of a man like the supervisor. In a village where everything went smooth the arrival of electricity causes discord. Thus the contrast between the public and private interests begin. Other important issues that are included in the film are superstitions and an immediate need for further advancements in the lives of people. Throughout the movie, there is an unknown witness who is unable associate with the changes happening in the village. Advancements increases day by day after the arrival of electricity, which includes a doctor‚Äôs arrival in the village. He comes and people start to consult him for no reason. (A 75-year-old woman complaints of her poor health, truly a sarcastic incident of what happens when advancements in a foreign culture happens for the first time). Mood of the film shifts when people try to associate everything with electricity as problems caused by it. Birds and animals die that aggravate peoples‚Äô attitude of finding faults with electricity. However, what we see later is people who supported and who did not support electricity gets benefit from the same. The young generation of Jose the girl are not concerned about education but are lost in a world of fantasies of weeklies. It is very interesting to note that all good and bad things happen after the arrival of electricity has some connection with it, like Jose's decision to go for higher education and the misfortunate deaths of some of the villagers are examples for that. The person who tries to read newspaper with much effort suggest that education has only begun to visit them. , p.? The theme is introduced by depicting the story of electrification of a village and the changes this introduces in the village. Unlike Aravindan's previous films, humour and intensity characterise Oridathu. When asked about this deviation, Aravindan stated, \\"There is an element of caricature in all the characters. A little exaggeration and lot of humour was consciously introduced to make effective the last sequence, which is the explosion. In fact the whole film moves towards the climax ‚Äî the clash on the day of the festival and the breaking out of the fire.\\", p.? The film is complex in that it has many characters and many incidents and therefore does not have a single motif. Hence, Aravindan had to use a number of shots in the film. The usual type of music is also absent. Instead, the sounds of the incidents are used to the maximum. In the film, different characters speak different dialects of Malayalam, for example the villagers speak pure Valluvanadan Malayalam of South Malabar, the overseer uses the Trivandrum Malayalam the fake Doctor uses Travancore Malayalam etc. Development Oridathu can be seen as a continuation of Aravindan's earlier film Thampu (The Circus Tent, 1978) and his cartoon series Cheriya Manushyarum Valiya Lokavum (The Small Man and the Big World)., p.? Thampu, shot in black and white in a direct documentary mode, dealt with the roving street circus of Kerala. Cheriya Manushyarum Valiya Lokavum, published in Mathrubhumi for several years, dealt with the adventures of the central characters Ramu and Guruji, mingled with political and social satires. The theme of Oridathu demanded a caricature treatment so Aravindan made it that way. The film is often described as \\"Ambiguous Humour Confronted by Modernisation\\"., p.407 Aravindan says that the film is not against modernisation. In an interview, the director said, \\"My film is not against modernisation. I was trying to look at the changes taking place in the life of the people and the village. I still fear one day that technology will take over. I was born in a small village and up to the age of ten I hadn't seen the electricity. I still remember with nostalgia those times, when people moved through the night with burning flares. When electricity came, they went out\\". Title The various alternative English titles of the film are Once Upon a Place, ... And There Was a Village, There Was a Village, At a Place, Some Place, and A Village, Somewhere.

Life GavrilƒÉ Maior was born in 1715, in SƒÉrƒÉuad, Szatm√°r County (Transylvania). He studied at Cluj and later from 1740 in the College of the Propaganda, Rome, where he on 28 January 1747 got a doctorate in theology and philosophy. He entered the Basilian monastery of the Holy Trinity in Blaj taking the name of Grigore, and on 25 December 1745 he was ordained a priest. He taught languages (Latin and Hungarian) in Blaj. On 30 June 1764, following the death of the Primate of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, the bishop of FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü Petru Pavel Aron, the electoral synod convened and Maior was chosen. Nevertheless the Hasburg monarch, Empress Maria Theresa, designated Atanasie Rednic as new bishop. Maior, unhappy he was not appointed bishop, murmured against the appointment of Rednic. For this reason Andr√°s Hadik, the commander of the Habsburg army in Transylvania, imprisoned Maior in Sibiu for three and a half months, and later confined him in the monastery of Mukachevo. In 1771 Maior pleaded withEmperor Joseph II, who was visiting the monastery, and succeeded in being released; he began work as censor of books in Vienna. Church of St. Peter and Paul in Sibiu founded by Grigore Maior At the death of Rednic, the electoral synod, on 15 August 1772, again voted for Maior, who this time was designated by the Empress on 27 October 1772 and appointed by Pope Clement XIV on 8 March 1773. His consecration as bishop took place on 23 April 1773 in a chapel of the imperial palace in Vienna, by the hands of the Croat Vasilije Bo≈æiƒçkoviƒá.at the time Byzantine vicar of the Latin Bishop of Zagreb, and from 1777 first bishop of the Eparchy of Kri≈æevci Empress Maria Theresa was present at the ceremony and was very impressed by the beautiful rituals of the Byzantine rite and by Major's speech, to whom the Empress bestowed a golden cross and a valuable ring. As Primate of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church he sent many students to study in universities abroad and he worked hard for the expansion of the Church, obtaining in the first two years the joining of a considerable number of new villages. These efforts created resentment from Protestants and Orthodox who complained at the imperial court. He also sided for the social claims of the Revolt of Horea, Clo≈üca and Cri≈üan. For these reasons he was forced to resign, as he did on 13 March 1782. He died in a monastery in Alba Iulia on 7 February 1785.

One recording session was at a portable studio set up at a Marriott hotel.\\" Andy was released on compact disc for the first time by Collectables Records in 2002 with eight bonus tracks that were taken from four of Williams's Columbia singles released between 1974 and 1979. Collectables included this CD in a box set entitled Classic Album Collection, Vol. 2, which contains 15 of his studio albums and two compilations and was released on November 29, 2002. Two of those four bonus A-sides originated as instrumental tracks from film scores and had lyrics added that were never heard in the film or on the corresponding soundtrack album: \\"Love Said Goodbye\\" is subtitled \\"Love Theme from The Godfather Part II\\" and \\"Are You in There?\\" is also labeled as \\"Main Theme from King Kong\\". \\"Love Said Goodbye\\" was also one of two of the bonus tracks that made the Billboard charts, starting a seven-week Easy Listening run in the magazine's January 11, 1975, issue that took the song to number 24..

Williams's cover of the song marked his last of 44 appearances on the Easy Listening chart, dating back to its inception in 1961, and his last of 53 hits on the Hot 100, the first being \\"Walk Hand in Hand\\" in 1956...

Founded in 1869, the cemetery was favored by wealthy families during the Gilded Age, and today the cemetery is known for its numerous lavish funerary monuments and mausoleums. The extensive early monument building at Lake View helped give rise to the Little Italy neighborhood, but over- expansion nearly bankrupted the burial ground in 1888. Financial recovery only began in 1893, and took several years. Lake View grew and modernized significantly from 1896 to 1915 under the leadership of president Henry R. Hatch. The cemetery's cautious management allowed it to avoid retrenchment and financial problems during the Great Depression. Two sites within the cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The first is the James A. Garfield Memorial, erected in 1890 as the tomb of assassinated President James A. Garfield. The second is Wade Memorial Chapel, which began construction in 1898 and was completed in 1901. It honors the memory of Jeptha Wade, one of the cemetery's co-founders, and was donated by his grandson. Founding of the cemetery =Creation of the Lake View Cemetery Association= Jeptha Wade in 1859 In 1868, prominent Cleveland businessmen Jeptha Wade, Henry B. Payne, and Joseph Perkins began discussing the need for a new cemetery for the city of Cleveland. They believed that the city's then- preeminent burial ground, Woodland Cemetery, was too small for the growing city as well as overcrowded, ill-maintained, and not scenic enough. They issued an invitation on May 8, 1869, to about 40 of the city's other leading businessmen, asking them to meet at the end of the month to discuss the organization of a new cemetery. Thirty of them showed up to the meeting on May 24. The group of 30 formed the nonprofit Lake View Cemetery Association on July 28, 1869. The trustees were William Bingham (owner of the W. Bingham Co. hardware company), Hinman B. Hurlbut (banking executive), Henry B. Payne (railroad investor), Joseph Perkins (banking and railroad executive), U.S. District Court Judge Charles Taylor Sherman, Amasa Stone (steelmaker and railroad investor), Worthy S. Streator (railroad executive and investor), Jeptha Wade (co-founder of Western Union), and Stillman Witt (railroad investor). Wade was named president, and Liberty E. Holden (owner of The Plain Dealer newspaper) the association clerk. The group resolved to build a garden cemetery in the style of Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston, Massachusetts, or Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Judge Sherman chose the name: Lake View Cemetery. Lake View was \\"non-sectarian\\" and open to all, which (in the 19th century) meant that its intended clientele were Protestant. The group sold 7 percent annual interest bonds in the association, hoping to raise $150,000 ($ in dollars). Within six weeks, they'd raised the money and set a new goal of $200,000 ($ in dollars), which was also reached. Selah Chamberlain (ironmaker, railroad investor, banker), Payne, Perkins, Stone, Wade, and Witt held $60,000 ($ in dollars) in bonds, while another 11 individuals held $55,000 ($ in dollars) in bonds. =Site selection, design, and construction= A committee was formed to choose a site for the new cemetery. Its members consisted of Holden, Payne, Perkins, Sherman, and J.C. Buell (a local banking executive). The committee wanted a location on the lake shore, but found nothing suitable. While traveling on Euclid Avenue, Holden came upon the cemetery site by chance. The area was known as \\"Smith Run\\". Beginning on the Erie Plain in the northwest, the site rose into the foothills of the Portage Escarpment. Dugway Brook (which bisected the site) and several small streams ran south-to-north through the area, carving out a number of ravines The Dugway Brook ravine was particularly deep, and Euclid bluestone (a bluish- colored sandstone) had once been quarried there. By late September 1869, the Lake View Association had purchased of land on this ridge adjacent to Euclid Avenue. (Within a year, the cemetery encompassed .) This gave the cemetery about of frontage on the avenue. The combined cost of the two purchases was $148,821.84 ($ in dollars). Located in what was then East Cleveland Township, the site was somewhat isolated. With the city pushing eastward at a swift pace, city and county government officials were already planning additional roads in the area, several of which would reach the new cemetery. Landscape architect Adolph Strauch, who designed Cincinnati's celebrated Spring Grove Cemetery, was hired in October 1869 to design Lake View. Joseph Earnshaw of Cincinnati was the civil engineer, and O.D. Ford was hired as the first superintendent. During the winter of 1869‚Äì1870, work crews began grading and laying down roads and paths, terracing part of the site for in-ground plots and mausoleums, and removing underbrush and unwanted trees. By February 1870, two sections were being laid out with a total of about 500 plots. The 300 plots in the first section went on sale on June 23, 1870, according to The Plain Dealer newspaper. The cost of a standard size in-ground grave was set at $4.00 ($ in dollars). Larger sites for families, monuments, or mausoleums went for 20 cents ($ in dollars) a square foot. The cemetery's distance from Cleveland's population center and the price of its plots meant that only those with a middle class income or better could afford to be buried at Lake View. Early years: 1869 to 1880 Adolph Strauch, who designed the master plan and laid out the initial sections of Lake View Cemetery It's not clear when the first interments at Lake View Cemetery were made, but several plots were in use by October 21, 1870. Improvements to and expansion of the cemetery continued over the next few years. The first ravine was bridged in November 1870, and in December the association purchased an unspecified number of acres that doubled the length of its frontage on Euclid Avenue. The cemetery sold $400,000 ($ in dollars) in bonds in 1871 to pay for more improvements. To secure the bonds, the cemetery pledged all but sold lots, roads, and water features. By August 1871, six sections of the cemetery were laid out and the receiving vault for use by plot-holders, designed by local architect Joseph Ireland, was almost finished. A superintendent's lodge at the front gate on Euclid Avenue was finished at the end of the year. By this time, several large, artistic funerary monuments had been erected at Lake View. The association purchased another of land in October 1872 and in January 1873. By June 1873, the cemetery had a total of . It had spent $65,643 ($ in dollars) on landscaping, with eight sections landscaped, plotted, and open for burials. The cemetery even dammed Dugway Brook in places to create ponds. Plots at Lake View Cemetery in its first three years sold for half the average price of plots in established cemeteries. Plot sales generated little income initially. At the close of the 1872-1873 fiscal year, the cemetery was technically bankrupt, with more debt (about $198,000 [$ in dollars]) than assets. Plot sales were brisk, however, and the cemetery was proving extremely popular with local residents. As much as 40 percent of all burials at Lake View Cemetery between 1870 and 1873 were removals from Woodland Cemetery. Another of land were purchased in August 1873, and the cemetery's acreage totalled in 1876. Euclid Avenue was paved up to Lake View Cemeteryn in 1874. Lake View Cemetery purchased another of land in 1875, issuing $150,000 ($ in dollars) in 6 percent annual interest bonds to pay for it. By 1877, The Plain Dealer estimated, more than $100,000 ($ in dollars) in funerary monuments dotted the landscape at Lake View Cemetery. These included the highly visible obelisks and shafts over the Doan, Kelley, McDermott, Potter, and Tisdale plots; the Goodrich and Jaynes memorials; the Keynes column (topped with a funerary urn); the Jeptha Wade shaft, which was topped by an angel; and the Hurlbut pillar topped with a weeping figure. There were also a number of monuments with well- designed, expertly carved bas-relief or freestanding sculptures. These included the angel atop the Truman P. Handy memorial, the weeping woman atop the Bucher and Hanna monuments, the group of angels supporting a cross atop the Cross grave, figures carved on the upright slabs over the Johnson and Garretson plots, a sculptural group named \\"Hope\\" atop the Perkins monument, and another sculptural group atop the Chamberlain monument. Although a number of large mausoleums had been built in the cemetery, the newspaper noted that the most elaborate of these was the tomb being erected by H.J. Wilcox. Wilcox had visited Italy, where he employed artisans to design a vault that mimicked the look of an Italian Renaissance chapel. With lots selling quickly, cemetery officials used the revenue to redeem debt. By 1878, only $10,000 of the 1871 bond issue remained unredeemed, and just $30,000 of the 1875 bond issue. The trustees decided to retire both debts by issuing $40,000 ($ in dollars) in new bonds at 7 percent annual interest. Although the new bonds were sold, the old debt was inexplicably not retired. Expansion: 1881 to 1890 The James A. Garfield Memorial =Building the Garfield Memorial= President James A. Garfield, a resident of nearby Mentor, Ohio, was shot in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 1881. He died on September 19, 1881. Garfield himself had expressed the wish to be buried at Lake View Cemetery, and the cemetery offered a burial site free of charge to his widow, Lucretia Garfield. Mrs. Garfield agreed to bury her husband at Lake View.; Garfield was temporarily interred in the cemetery's public vault on September 26, 1881, then transferred on October 22 to an empty mausoleum owned and designed by noted local architect Levi Scofield. Even before Garfield's funeral, plans were laid by his friends and admirers for a grand tomb to be erected at the highest point in the cemetery. The popularity of the garden-like cemetery and the public's desire to see Garfield's resting place were such that large crowds began thronging Lake View every Sunday. Roughly 50,000 people a year were visiting the crypt. The cemetery received no revenues from the memorial committee despite the wear and tear on its property. Cemetery officials began requiring tickets in the summer of 1882 to enter the grounds in order to control the crowds and maintain a suitable atmosphere for mourning.; Relic hunters were so willing to vandalize the Scofield tomb (they even ripped up the grass around it) that a wire fence had to be erected to keep them away. In 1891, the cemetery barred all non- lotholding visitors from the cemetery on Sundays unless they had a pass. With only about 230 Sunday passes available, hundreds of people were turned away. The Garfield Memorial Committee selected the highest point in the cemetery in June 1883 for the president's final resting place. Lake View Cemetery built a road around the memorial in early 1885, and began work on cutting a road from the Euclid Gate to the memorial site in the fall of that year. The cemetery also began work on making improvements to the landscape, water, and drainage around the site. The Garfield Memorial was dedicated on May 30, 1890. Lucretia Garfield, the president's widow, died on March 13, 1918, and was interred in the Garfield Memorial on March 21. =Rise of Little Italy= Little Italy largely owes its inception to funerary monument maker Joseph Carabelli. In 1870, the 20-year-old northern Italian journeyman stonecarver emigrated to the United States. He spent 10 years in New York City, where he dressed stone and carved the statue Industry for the Federal Building and Post Office in Brooklyn. Carabelli relocated to Cleveland in 1880, establishing the Lake View Granite and Monumental Works on Mayfield Road adjacent to the cemetery. Carabelli began encouraging other Italian sculptors, stonecutters, and artisans to settle in Cleveland near his works, and by 1885 a substantial enclave of Italians, mostly immigrants, had grown up there. By 1892, the neighborhood adjacent to the cemetery's southwestern corner had become known as Little Italy.; It was largely inhabited by Italian immigrants who worked as groundskeepers at Lake View or who worked in the funeral monument companies making headstones or memorials for placement in the cemetery. 1892 also saw the city of Cleveland annex Little Italy. The annexation included all of Lake View Cemtery west of a line running from the end of Brightwood Avenue south to Mayfield Road. =Streetcar access= Lake View, Collamer & Euclid Railway, a streetcar line, proposed a line to reach Lake View's main gate in July 1874. However, as built in 1876, the line followed Superior Avenue to Euclid Avenue before proceeding east‚Äîreaching Euclid east of Lake View Cemetery. The first streetcar to reach Lake View Cemetery was the East Cleveland Railway's Euclid Avenue Line in 1886. The company extended its tracks from its existing terminus at E. 107th Street up Euclid Avenue to Rosedale Avenue in East Cleveland (just short of the major thoroughfare of Noble Road). The East Cleveland Railway opened a second set of tracks, an extension of its Cedar Avenue Line, in 1889. This line began at the company's car barn at the intersection of Euclid Avenue and Coltman Road. The line traveled south on Coltman to reach Mayfield Road, then south down Murray Hill Road to Cedar Avenue. A year after the Cedar Avenue Line extension opened, the Cleveland Electric Railway Company opened its Mayfield Road Line. This line went past Lake Views Mayfield Road gate. The line began at the East Cleveland Railway's car barn, went south down Coltman to Mayfield, and then east on Mayfield to Lee Road. This line closed in 1907. In 1902, Lake View Cemetery gave permission for the Cleveland Electric Railway to build a spur into the cemetery so that the streetcar firm's funeral car could be used to transport caskets and funeral parties to the cemetery. Financial difficulties =Emergence of the financial crisis= As of 1888, Lake View Cemetery had of land. About had been laid out, but only half had been sold. The cemetery association had spent $800,000 ($ in dollars) buying land and improving it. By the end of 1888, about 14 percent of Lake View's had been sold, bringing in $406,000 ($ in dollars). The price of a single-burial lot had more than doubled since the cemetery opened, to ($ to $ in dollars) a square foot. By late 1888, Lake View Cemetery was nearing bankruptcy. Mismanagement was part of the problem, and The Plain Dealer newspaper said the cemetery's financial records were in \\"deplorable\\" shape. Lake View had outstanding debt of $432,980 ($ in dollars), and interest on the debt consumed $23,031 a year ($ in dollars). Maintenance of the few open sections cost another $9,676 ($ in dollars) a year, yet income was only $23,875 ($ in dollars) a year on average. The cemetery superintendent had spent $150,000 to $200,000 ($ to $ in dollars) on improvements, a figure officials privately admitted was too much. Lot sales fell below expectations, and the cemetery had never established a reserve fund to see the organization through difficult economic times. Cemetery trustees were aware of the worsening deficit many years earlier, and believed the cemetery should stop paying interest on its bonds to bring its finances back in order. This step was not taken because the trustees believed many bondholders relied on interest for income. The cemetery began quietly borrowing money from the Citizens Savings and Loan Association, a local bank, in order to pay interest on its bonds. The association paid out only 4 percent of the 7 percent annual interest due on its bonds at the end of 1888, creating a severe financial hardship for bondholders who relied on the interest for their living expenses. Bonds which formerly sold for $108 to $110 (the par value was $100) now began selling at $50 to $75. Angry bondholders protested the move, but were assured that the cemetery's financial problems were temporary. Bondholders representing about $50,000 out the bonds formed a committee in late March 1889 to seek more information about the cemetery's financial status. Quietly, the cemetery began accepting bonds as payment for lots. Usually, purchasers held few bonds, with those holding large amounts of bonds refusing to sell. Although the exchange of bonds for lots would impact revenues, cemetery officials believed that only $7,000 to $8,000 in bonds would be redeemed. =February 1889 proposed rescue plan= Daniel P. Eells, the cemetery trustee who proposed the November 1889 financial rescue plan The initial plan to save Lake View Cemetery, proposed by association officials, paid bondholders 3 percent of interest due in cash and the remainder in scrip. The cemetery would also create a sinking fund to redeem scrip. To generate revenue, the cost of lots would be halved to just 25 cents ($ in dollars) a square foot; the surge in lot-buying, it was believed would raise $2 million ($ in dollars). In addition, spending on cemetery improvements would be cut back sharply. The reaction of the bondholders was not reported, but area businesspeople began suggesting that the city of Cleveland purchase the cemetery. The plan was amended at the end of April 1889 so that all interest coming due that year was paid in scrip. Interest due after 1889 would be paid 3 percent in cash, 4 percent in scrip. The cemetery agreed to pay 6 percent annual interest on scrip, to devote all income first to maintaining the cemetery and second to paying cash interest, and to create a second sinking fund dedicated to redeeming bonds at maturity. Excess income (after expenditures for maintenance and cash interest) would go toward the sinking funds, redemption of scrip, a fund to pay the next year's cash interest, and to pay other debts. Significant bondholder opposition to the plan began to emerge. In June 1889, the Lake View Cemetery Association paid only 3 percent of the 7 percent annual interest due in cash, the remainder in scrip. The cemetery was forced to redeem $11,000 ($ in dollars) in bonds at par that month alone as payment for lots. The redemption of bonds significantly impacted the cemetery's cash flow, and by the end of 1889 it could not pay any interest in cash. Income was so negatively impacted by the exchange of bonds for lots that cemetery trustees admitted on June 1, 1889, that no cash interest would be paid at the end of the year; all interest would be paid in scrip. The trustees also warned that scrip might not be issued unless bondholders agreed to the cemetery's financial rescue plan. Angry bondholders began to threaten lawsuits to personally hold the trustees responsible for the payment of interest. The bonds-for-lots exchange program proved financially disastrous. Lake View sold lots worth $12,000 in September 1889 but received only $1,000 in cash as the remainder was paid in bonds. In the same month, maintenance expenses amounted to $5,000. At the beginning of October 1889, the association stopped accepting the full amount of bonds for the purchase of lots, and said it would accept bonds for only one-third of the lot sale price. The cemetery also agreed to accept scrip for up to a third of a lot's cost as well. =November 1889 proposed rescue plan= Local banker and cemetery trustee Daniel P. Eells proposed in November 1889 to form a syndicate to raise $200,000 ($ in dollars) and redeem two-thirds of all outstanding bonds at the current market price. A trustee would hold the redeemed bonds until January 1, 1893, paying interest on them from net cash income. The trustee would distribute the bonds on a pro rata basis on January 2, 1893. Subscribers to the redemption fund were essentially betting that the price of the bonds in 1893 would have risen more than enough to not only cover their investment but also offset the loss of income from the reduced interest payments. Eells said the cemetery faced bankruptcy if the syndicate scheme was not adopted. Gaining acceptance from the bondholders was complicated. C.F. Houghton, a banker and bond dealer based on the East Coast, held all $10,000 of the outstanding 1871 bonds and $7,000 of the 1875 bonds. Samuel E. Williamson, a local judge, held $13,000 of the 1875 issue. Another 331 individuals held the remaining $10,000 of the 1875 and all $40,000 of the 1878 issue. Houghton claimed to have been given misleading information on the amount of outstanding debt by Lake View officials, and he threatened to sue the cemetery to force it into receivership (a process which would take about six years to accomplish). Support for the cemetery's plan among the miscellaneous bondholders was about evenly split. Those in opposition argued it was unethical for the cemetery to create a financial crisis which caused bond interest to cease and bond prices to collapse, and then turn around and offer to buy those bonds back at the new low price. A recession hit the U.S. economy in 1890 followed by a brief depression in 1891, further depressing lot sales. By 1892, the grounds at Lake View Cemetery were seriously neglected. Sections ready for sale were unmown, weeds and other plants grew wild, and erosion and drought had left some areas bare of vegetation. Only a small percentage of the cemetery's roads were paved, and the remainder, all dirt roads, were heavily eroded and rutted. Lake View's finances were so poor that many residents believed it was close to bankruptcy. The association needed revenue so badly that its trustees considered lowering the price of lots so that the poor could afford to be buried there. The cemetery generated so little revenue that it had incurred about $365,700 ($ in dollars) in debt above and beyond interest and principal owed on bonds. =1892 approved rescue plan= Harry Garfield, who helped Lake View Cemetery through its financial crisis of the 1890s With revenues extraordinarily low and the association not having paid any interest in cash since 1889, cemetery trustees formed a committee consisting of Daniel P. Eels, Henry R. Hatch, and Edwin R. Perkins to see what level of cash interest could be sustained. The committee proposed a new plan in February 1892: All 1871 and 1878 bondholders could turn in their bonds and receive a new \\"refunding bond\\" paying lower annual interest. To cover all outstanding debt, about $400,000 ($ in dollars) in \\"refunding bonds\\", back-dated to December 1, 1891, would be issued. They would have a $1,000 par value, and be payable in 50 years. Interest for the last six months of 1892 would be paid in cash at a 7 percent annual rate. The new bonds would carry coupons for all other past-due interest, to be paid at a 6 percent annual rate. Additionally, redeemed bondholders would receive an income debenture equal to 20 percent of the bond's face value. Only $100,000 ($ in dollars) in income debentures would be issued, carrying a 7 percent (or less) annual interest rate. To ensure payment of the interest on the debentures, the cemetery agreed to establish a sinking fund whose proceeds would pay the interest. Lake View Cemetery agreed that revenues would go toward maintenance and cemetery expenses first. Excess revenues would be applied first to the income debentures, second to interest on the 1878 and refunding bonds, third to sinking fund payments, and lastly to any reasonable improvements to be made to the cemetery. The cemetery staff believed that only about $4,000 ($ in dollars) a year was needed to maintain the cemetery. Interest on the 1875 bond issue (of which only $35,000 was outstanding) amounted to $2,100 a year ($ in dollars), while interest on the refunding bonds would amount to $16,000 a year ($ in dollars). About half the outstanding bondholders approved of Lake View's plan, but it needed 90 percent to do so before the financial recovery plan could be implemented. The cemetery association tried and failed to get bondholder approval for its plan, and then turned for assistance to Harry A. Garfield, son of President James A. Garfield and a local attorney who represented several cemetery bondholders. Garfield felt the association's plan was needed to ensure the cemetery's financial stability, and began sending personalized and form letters to all the bondholders in December 1891. The cemetery's plan was tweaked to provide for even smaller par values for the refunding bonds. In total, $500,000 ($ in dollars) in refunding bonds were proposed, 350 at $1,000 par value, 50 at $500 par value, and 1,250 at $100 par value. Five months after Garfield began his lobbying effort, 75 percent of bondholders approved the plan. The remaining approvals were received in June 1892, and the LVCA board of directors authorized issuance of the refunding bonds. Legal work took longer than usual, however, and it was not until December that the bonds were finally issued. The cemetery's financial condition improved significantly over the next few years. Although some board members felt the cemetery should still be sold to the city of Cleveland, the board rejected this proposal overwhelmingly in June 1895. The cemtery board approved the erection of a crematorium in 1900, but no action was taken on the plan. Renewed improvement In 1896, Lake View Cemetery's entrance was unprepossessing. Located next to Mayfield Road about southwest of the current entrance, it consisted of a small wooden gate, a two- room office in a wooden shack just inside the gate, and a small wood-frame home for the superintendent adjacent to the office. Henry R. Hatch was elected Lake View's president in June 1896. Lake View was in dilapidated condition, with nearly all monuments and headstones sinking or out of plumb. The cemetery's financial problems had hindered its development for years now, and Hatch implemented new, modern financial and recordkeeping systems to further improve accounting and cash flow. A new system of gravedigging orders was also implemented, and cemetery engineering was improved. Lake View had long laid out lots according to the contour of the ground. Steep slopes were avoided, and roads with storm drains laid out before a section was plotted. The new engineering standards required that all sections have a wide infrastructure border around them. The outermost tier of graves was intended for monuments, and lots were deep. All other tiers had lots just in length, with a walkway between tiers. Any section deeper than in depth also needs to have a wide service road bisecting it. All ground was roughly graded before the construction of infrastructure and roads; wet ground was drained after rough grading. Section and lot corners were marked with cornerstones, and all permanent fixtures were recorded on the cemetery engineer's maps. With the Long Depression ending in the United States, the board believed lot sales would rise significantly. With the board's backing, Hatch began making new improvements to the cemetery and converting undeveloped land into sections 4, 10, and 26 at a cost of $10,000 ($ in dollars). Realizing that lot sizes were too large and expensive for middle-class purchasers, Hatch ordered that lots in what is now Section 26 be small and affordable like those at Woodland Cemetery. Unsold large lots in what is now Section 1 were subdivided into smaller lots as well. Terra cotta markers were placed to mark section boundaries, and new maps of the cemetery produced for the first time in several years. Cemetery-wide improvements included the laying of of fresh water pipe for irrigation purposes, of drainage pipe to reclaim soggy land for burial purposes, of new fencing around the exterior of the cemetery, of new concrete sidewalks, and extensive graveling of dirt roads. Cemetery staff were given uniforms to wear for the first time, and a marquee purchased to provide cover for funeral attendees during inclement weather. In sections with large lots intended for funerary monuments, Hatch ordered that lot corners by marked with a piece of polished dark Quincy granite with lot numbers carved into each corner. Where section lots contained just two to six graves, corners were marked with a piece of Georgia marble or slate. Hatch also hired landscape architect Ernest W. Bowditch to finish laying out the cemetery's . Bowditch retained the garden cemetery design begun in 1869, and began planting large numbers of ornamental trees, including bald cypress, copper beech, gingko, oriental plane, pin oak, and purple beech. Importantly, he also planned a new entrance for Lake View Cemetery on Euclid Avenue, with a new circle just inside the cemetery gate. The new office building at the entrance was designed by noted local architect Charles F. Schweinfurth, and the cost of its construction donated by Hatch. Neoclassical in style, it was faced with Ohio sandstone. The $6,000 ($ in dollars) rectangular structure was in size. The floors and wainscoting were hardwood. Ground for the new office building was broken on October 21, 1897, and it was completed in April 1898. =Construction of Wade Memorial Chapel= Wade Memorial Chapel in 2018 In 1896, Jeptha H. Wade II decided to fund the construction of a new receiving vault and chapel, dedicated to the memory of his father, at Lake View Cemetery. Wade asked the newly-founded Cleveland architectural firm of Hubbell & Benes to create a preliminary design. He was so happy with their work that he chose this concept as the design for the chapel and commissioned Hubbell & Benes to finalize the blueprints. The association did not formally accept the new chapel until the plans were done. The site chosen for the chapel was between two existing lakes, diagonally across a road from the existing public vault. The exterior walls were clad in near-white Barre granite from Barre, Vermont. The interior decor was designed and manufactured by Tiffany & Co. The commission was considered so important that Louis Comfort Tiffany personally contacted Hubbell & Benes to win the job. The chapel featured a massive stained glass window at the rear and mosaics on each side wall. The stained glass window, titled Resurrection or Flight of the Soul, was designed by Tiffany artisan Agnes Northrop. Tiffany artist Frederick Wilson designed the wall mosaics. The Favrile glass and gold tile mosaics depicted the passage of life to death. The left side mosaic became known as \\"The River of Life\\", while the other had the title \\"The River of Death\\". The chapel featured a casket pedestal in place of an altar. This pedestal could be lowered mechanically through the floor into crypt, where the receiving vault was located. The \\"public\\" portion of the crypt could hold as many as 96 coffins. Two private receiving vaults also existed on the crypt level, closed off by marble doors. Ground for the new chapel was broken on February 19, 1898. The hillside was excavated down to bedrock, and the foundations and crypt level finished in late December 1898. Completing the interior took much longer than expected, and the chapel was not finished until 1901. The cost was variously reported to be $350,000 ($ in dollars), $150,000 ($ in dollars), $140,000 ($ in dollars), and \\"more than $100,000\\" ($ in dollars). =Erecting the Rockefeller Monument= The obelisk at the Rockefeller family plot In 1898, John D. Rockefeller, the co-founder and largest stockholder in Standard Oil and one of the wealthiest men in the United States, began the erection of a funerary monument in Lake View Cemetery. Some time before 1882, Rockfeller purchased a family plot on one of the cemetery's highest points, slightly northeast of the Garfield Memorial. Three people were buried in the John D. Rockefeller plot. Two of them were children of Frank Rockefeller, John's brother. They were William Scofield Rockefeller (81 days old, died on March 17, 1878) and Myra Rockefeller, 2 years and 81 days old, died on August 23, 1886). Rockefeller's mother, Eliza Rockefeller, died on March 28, 1889, in New York City. She was buried in the Rockefeller plot at Lake View on March 30. Construction began on the Rockefeller Monument in 1898. Quarried in Barre, Vermont, by the Wetmore and Morse Granite Co. of Montpelier, Vermont, several hundred tons of rock had to be blown before a piece of rock big enough for the obelisk could be found. The Egyptian-style obelisk alone was high with a bottom square. It was the largest granite shaft ever quarried in the United States, and the second- largest single-piece shaft to be erected in the United States after Cleopatra's Needle in Central Park in New York City. The Plain Dealer newspaper believed it to be the tallest shaft ever erected over a private grave anywhere in the world. The first base of the pedestal was square and high. The second base was by and high. The die was by and high. The total height of the monument was . The Rockefeller obelisk was dressed in Vermont. It had minimal if graceful ornamental elements on the base, with the name \\"Rockefeller\\" on the second base. The New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (the \\"Nickel Plate\\") transported the shaft and other elements of the monument from Vermont. The shaft alone weighed ; combined with the bases and die, the monument's total weight was . The obelisk was the heaviest item the railroad could move without straining its bridges. Even so, the railroad had to design and build special rail cars to carry the load, and build a heavy-duty spur from its main line to the quarry. The Rockefeller monument arrived in Cleveland on Sunday, February 11, 1899. A house moving company used horses and a windlass to move the obelisk from the railroad tracks along Mayfield Road to the cemetery's Mayfield Road entrance. By March 3, the obelisk had only moved four blocks to reach Mayfield Place (now E. 124 Street), and was beginning to make its way up the steep hill which Mayfield Road climbed. At that time, the movers believed it would take only three weeks for the obelisk to make it the up hill. Weather and other delays hindered the shaft's progress, however, and it was up the hill and only halfway through the cemetery‚Äîand still short of its final destination‚Äîby June 25. A derrick to erect the obelisk was rented by W. F. Howland (the firm to which the Carabelli monument company had subcontracted the erection work), but the delays in moving the obelisk meant the derrick's use was required elsewhere. The derrick was erected again at Lake View about August 26. The first base was put in place on August 31. The second base was cemented to it on September 1 using a special French cement, and the die cemented to the second base on September 2. The obelisk was hoisted upright on September 11. The derrick's wooden superstructure proved too weak to lift the obelisk into the air, and had to be reinforced. The shaft was finally lifted into and cemented in place on September 12 while a large crowd of onlookers watched. Stoneworkers applied the finishing touches to the monument on September 13, 1899. The Rockefeller Monument cost $50,000 ($ in dollars) to quarry and erect, and another $10,000 ($ in dollars) to move. Continued improvement: 1900 to the Great Depression Henry R. Hatch, the president who led Lake View Cemetery back to financial prosperity and rapidly modernized operations. In 1900, Lake View Cemetery had just over 10 percent () of its land developed into cemetery plots. Lakes, streams, roads, and other features took up another . Undeveloped land remained heavily forested, with beech, elm, maple, and oak trees predominating. =Financial prosperity= Lot sales were extremely high in 1895, 1896, 1897, and 1898, helping to improve the cemetery's financial condition and making its bonds well-regarded for investment purposes. Lot sales declined significantly in 1899 and early 1900, but the cemetery still grossed $35,500 ($ in dollars) in sales revenue and counted more than 6,000 total interments by 1901. It had assets worth $1,119,302 ($ in dollars) and debts of just $626,290 ($ in dollars) Lake View was paying interest on its debt every six months, and the sinking fund was ample. The cemetery created an endowment fund in 1900, and put $7,207 into it ($ in dollars). In July 1900, John D. Rockefeller gave Lake View Cemetery a gift of $10,000 ($ in dollars), the first of several donations. Rockefeller's gift was used to open a section for the poor, to lay fresh water pipes in several sections, and for other improvements. The cemetery received another $15,000 ($ in dollars) in other cash donations during year as well. Lake View Cemetery reported lot sales of $40,778 ($ in dollars) in 1901, assets of $1.19 million ($ in dollars), and debts of just $626,290 ($ in dollars). The following year, lot sales increased and the cemetery spent $25,000 ($ in dollars) to make an unusually large number of improvements, rebuilding old roads, adding new roads, draining some land, and opening a number of new sections. John D. Rockefeller made another $10,000 donation ($ in dollars), and the cemetery received another $12,272 ($ in dollars) in donations from other sources. Lot sales rose again in 1903. Rockefeller made a third donation of $10,000 ($ in dollars), and other donations totaled about $7,000 ($ in dollars). Lake View Cemetery continued to see lot sales rise in 1904, generating $55,230 ($ in dollars). Donations brought in another $8,186 ($ in dollars). The cemetery made $20,040 ($ in dollars) in improvements during the year, adding fresh water pipes, stormwater sewers, and building three tool houses (each with a telephone) in the cemetery. With expenses and supplies requiring just $22,148 ($ in dollars), the cemetery had more than enough cash on hand for interest payments, the sinking fund, and scrip interest and redemption. Lot sales and associated revenues were even higher in 1905 ($63,201 [$ in dollars]), with expenses and supplies rising to $37,915 ($ in dollars) and improvement spending dropping to $14,840 ($ in dollars). Lake View was so flush with cash that it made an extraordinary $10,000 ($ in dollars) payment to the sinking fund. For the first time in years, Lake View Cemetery Association trustees discussed opening a number of new sections, and began discussing setting aside sections solely for the construction of large, expensive mausoleums. =Section 23 experiment and the death of Hatch= The 1910s and 1920s continued to be years of prosperity for Lake View Cemetery. Its maintenance staff had grown so much that it built an addition to its maintenance shop in 1909. It opened Section 23 in 1913. This section was \\"pre- designed\\" by cemetery staff, architects, landscape architects, and sculptors, many of them associated with the Cleveland School of Art. The landscaping around the lot's borders and at strategic points in its interior was designed to accommodate and complement only certain types of funerary monuments. In 18 of the 32 lots in these areas, the cemetery issued highly specific, narrow rules regulating the size and type of monument which could be erected. In the remaining 14 key lots, the cemetery \\"strongly suggested\\" to buyers that only certain kinds of funerary monuments be used in these locations (explicitly ruling out funerary vases). Headstones were allowed to rise only above the surface of the earth. All local funerary monument companies were furnished with a booklet on monument design to assist them in designing gravestones appropriate for Section 23, and for all other sections at Lake View. Lake View Cemetery suffered two setbacks in 1915. On January 28, the cemetery's old two- story wood office building burned to the ground. Maps, plot plans, and the blueprints for hundreds of mausoleums and monuments were lost. On May 20, Henry R. Hatch died suddenly, depriving Lake View of the energetic and visionary president who had led the organization since 1896. Hatch left a cemetery in excellent financial condition. Lake View was making so much money that cemetery was able to purchase $50,000 ($ in dollars) worth of Liberty Loan bonds in 1917 to support the American cause in World War I. In a snapshot of the cemetery's financial success, the trustees reported that it made a surplus of $62,165 ($ in dollars) in 1922. It had assets totaling $3,021,888 ($ in dollars), which included an endowment and sinking fund of $1,704,737 ($ in dollars). Its outstanding debts were $2,016,192 ($ in dollars). =Modernization, ownership of the Garfield Memorial, and push east= A Fordson Model F tractor, the type of tractor used by Lake View Cemetery beginning about 1922 Part of the cemetery's success was attributed to its use of modern technology. For years, Lake View maintenance staff had used 50 lawn mowers and 30 hand-held scythe lawn trimmers. In 1917, the cemetery purchased a two-ton truck from the Acme Motor Truck Co. of Cadillac, Michigan. The truck was used to haul materials from Lake View's quarry around the cemetery for the construction of buildings and macadam roads and the setting of headstone foundations. By 1922, the cemetery also used Fordson tractors to dig graves, place monuments, clear snow, and maintain roads. About 1923, Lake View purchased two one-ton Ford trucks for general-duty use around the cemetery. Cemetery shops manufactured a \\"tent wagon\\", a \\"grave wagon\\" and both metal- and concrete-lined \\"dump carts\\". Originally developed in 1913, the dump carts were used to carry earth from graves. Up to six carts could be attached to a single Ford truck. In late October 1923, the Garfield National Monument Association turned the Garfield Memorial over to Lake View Cemetery. Most of the Monument Association's members had died, and its charter did not permit for a self-perpetuating board. After accepting title to the memorial and its land, Lake View Cemetery immediately ended the practice of charging a 10 cent ($ in dollars) admission fee to the memorial. Lake View also began cleaning, repairing, and rehabilitating the memorial. Increasingly, Lake View Cemetery turned its attention to its Mayfield Road border and entrance. The city of Cleveland Heights, incorporated as a hamlet in 1901, included within its boundaries the southern portion of Lake View. Cleveland Heights grew very rapidly. Its population rose from 1,564 at the time of incorporation to 2,576 in 1910, a 64.7 percent increase. By 1920, Cleveland Heights had 15,264 residents, a six-fold increase. Cleveland Heights incorporated as a city in 1921. Lake View Cemetery was the burial ground of choice for the upper-middle class suburb. Although the Mayfield Road gate was locked, the cemetery gave keys to the gate to those Cleveland Heights residents who were lotholders. Great Depression and war: 1929 to 1945 The Great Depression put significant financial stress on Lake View Cemetery. Those who had purchased large lots often failed to keep up payments. Cemetery officials allowed them to sell back a portion of their lots in order to retain at least some burial ground. When the owners of large lots defaulted on their purchase contracts completely, Lake View threatened to disinter the bodies in the plot and move them to single-grave lots in another part of the cemetery and re-sell the large plot. The cemetery responded to the economic crisis with retrenchment as well. It lowered the price of a single grave by 20 percent, to $60 ($ in dollars). The cemetery also cut wages for all maintenance workers and grave diggers making more than 55 cents an hour ($ in dollars), and laid off 10 men. In response, workers organized a trade union in 1937 under the auspices of the Arborists and Landscapers Union, LIUNA Local 344, AFL. Manpower shortages hit Lake View Cemetery during World War II as laborers enlisted in the military or were drafted. To assist in the war effort, the cemetery allowed large portions of unused land to be converted into Victory gardens. Wartime inflation and the rapidly declining number of wealthy families in the Cleveland area hurt lot sales. The cemetery subsequently shifted its marketing efforts to focus on middle and working class families. Latter half of the 20th century As more people chose cremation as a burial option in the latter half of the 20th century, Lake View Cemetery responded by constructing and opening a cremains mausoleum in 1990. Any member of the public may purchase a niche in the mausoleum for cremains. 21st century Lake View Cemetery has been under persistent financial stress since the start of the new millennium. Operating deficits are common, and the LVCA has occasionally cut back services and staff. Even though the cemetery is a significant tourist attraction and the site of a presidential memorial, Lake View received no local, state, or federal funding as of 2017. In 2006, the Lake View Cemetery Foundation made education and tourism its top priorities. From 2001 to 2010, the number of individuals participating in officially sponsored foundation tours increased to 10,000 from 3,000, while the number of sponsored educational programs nearly doubled from 10 to 19. Lake View Cemetery spent $5 million in 2016 and 2017 conserving, repairing, and upgrading the James A. Garfield Memorial's structural elements. This included reinforcing beams and columns in the basement, In 2019, the cemetery began a multi-million-dollar project to clean the exterior and repoint any damaged or missing mortar. It is the first time in the memorial's history that the exterior has been cleaned. Lake View Cemetery celebrated its 150th anniversary with two years of events in 2019 and 2020. About the cemetery The garden cemetery is located in the \\"heights\\" area of Greater Cleveland, with a view of Lake Erie to the north. The burying ground had of land in 2007, with more than 104,000 burials. There are two entrances, on Euclid Avenue and Mayfield Road. The cemetery provides a plot in its Veterans Section free of charge to all honorably discharged U.S. armed forces veterans. =Governance= The nonprofit Lake View Cemetery Association owns and governs the cemetery. Originally, membership in the association was open to anyone who purchased a lot, making the association akin to a church or a club. Members elected a 20-member board of trustees (with four seats up each year), and a board secretary. The board met quarterly, while a five-member executive committee of the board met monthly. The board appointed the cemetery's president, vice president, and superintendent. Income from lot sales was used primarily to pay for staff salaries and the maintenance and improvement of the grounds. Among the many board and executive office positions, only the superintendent and the board secretary received pay. The Lake View Cemetery Association reincorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1926, with the LVCA now acting as a nonprofit association for the benefit for lotholders. Annual meetings of lotholders to elect directors and officers were no longer held. Instead, a self-perpetuating board of directors was elected which continues to own and govern the cemetery. Lake View's annual budget in 2012 was $6.1 million ($ in dollars). Income from lots sales and services to families made up 60 percent of all cemetery revenue in 2001, and 80 percent of all revenue in 2012. Charitable contributions make up much of the remaining income. The Lake View Cemetery Foundation provides a significant portion of this charitable income. Foundation donations were 6 percent of all cemetery revenue in 2001, rising to 16 percent of all revenues in 2011. As of 2017, roughly half of the cemetery's annual costs were spent on maintaining the grounds, headstones, monuments, and mausoleums. The other half goes to staff and office operations. =Leadership= Following is a partial list of the presidents of the Lake View Cemetery Association. The president oversaw the day-to-day operations of the cemetery along with the superintendent. * Jeptha H. Wade, 1869 to 1879 * Joseph Perkins, 1879 to 1885 (his death) * Jeptha H. Wade, 1885 to 1890 (his death) * William Edwards, 1890; ; ; to 1893 * Timothy Doane Crocker, 1893 to 1896 * Henry R. Hatch, 1896 to 1915 * Douglas Perkins, 1915 to 1921; (his death) * Jerome B. Zerbe, 1921 to 1924 * Francis F. Prentiss, 1925 to 1926 =Lake View Cemetery Foundation= The Lake View Cemetery Foundation was established by the Lake View Cemetery Association in 1986 as a 501(c)(13) organization. The foundation was originally chartered to raise money to repair and restore the James A. Garfield Memorial and to establish a fund for its ongoing maintenance. After the renovation was completed, the foundation expanded its goals to include enhancing, maintaining, and preserving the botanical gardens, buildings, horticulture, landscape, monuments, and areas at Lake View Cemetery to benefit the general public. The foundation's new mission specifically embraced education and outreach programs. Although the foundation provides assistance to the cemetery in maintaining historic buildings and monuments and historic or horticulturally significant aspects of the grounds, it is both separately governed and administered from the cemetery. The foundation's 2012 annual budget was $567,000 ($ in dollars). Foundation assistance is not unrestricted, but targeted to meet the goals established by the foundation's board of directors and its strategic plan. Charitable donations make up roughly half of the foundation's annual income, although these can vary widely from year to year. Donations provided 65 percent of income in 2013. Investment income also varies considerably over time, but has averaged about 30 percent of all foundation revenues between 2002 and 2012. Service fee income is a relatively negligible 2 percent of all revenues. =Notable sites and funerary monuments= The James A. Garfield Memorial is the most prominent point of interest at Lake View Cemetery. The ornate interior features a large marble statue, stained glass, bas relief, and various historical relics from Garfield's life and presidency. The monument also serves as a scenic observation deck and picnic area. President and Mrs. Garfield are entombed in the lower level crypt, their coffins placed side by side and visible to memorial visitors. Lake View Cemetery is home to the Wade Memorial Chapel, which features an interior designed by Louis Tiffany. Behind the chapel is a large pond. The cemetery is famous for its numerous statues of angels, sculpted in a Victorian style. A well-known memorial, the Angel of Death Victorious at the gravesite of the Haserot family, was created by sculptor Herman Matzen. In popular culture The cemetery is among those profiled in the 2005 PBS documentary A Cemetery Special. Scenes of the 2014 film Captain America: The Winter Soldier were filmed at the flood control dam at the cemetery. Notable interments Notable people buried at Lake View Cemetery include: * Newton D.

It was first published in Spirou in 1980 and appeared in book format in 1984. Plot Hefty Smurf decides to organize games to get the other Smurfs to play sports. When the Smurfs hear the prize is a medal, they don't care (since they already got medals in the King Smurf story), so the prize is changed to a kiss from the Smurfette. The Smurfs form two teams for the games: yellow team and red team. Nobody wants Weakling Smurf on their team, so Hefty Smurf suggests to him to compete on his own. Brainy Smurf decides to be the referee, and has cards of any color, but lacks a whistle, so asks Handy Smurf to make one for him. The following morning, Hefty Smurf goes to see the Smurfs' training, and finds Weakling Smurf alone, so he goes to wake the others, who then decide to eat breakfast. Hefty Smurf criticizes them and tells them to follow Weakling Smurf's example, so they decide to watch Weakling Smurf's training. Weakling Smurf makes a poor time running. During his hammer-throwing practice, accidentally hits Hefty Smurf's foot when trying to raise the hammer, and then throws it at very little distance. For the high jump, he jumps under the bar, but feels proud since he didn't touch the bar, just like Hefty Smurf told him. Then comes the training of the other Smurfs. Handy Smurf uses springs for the long jump, which Hefty Smurf tells him is again the rules, but then he notices he hasn't written a rulebook, so Papa Smurf offers his help writing one. In the meantime, the Smurfs train in unorthodox ways, until Hefty Smurf begins crying, so the others promise to take the training seriously during the following days. Papa Smurf arrives with the completed rulebook, but Hefty Smurf tells him they don't need it anymore. The afternoon before the games, Papa Smurf finds Weakling Smurf, who has decided to leave the games because he will always be a weakling. Papa Smurf gives him a formula he must apply on his nose before any event to win. The next morning, the games begin with the arrival of the yellow team, the red team and Weakling Smurf (who wears green). Weakling Smurf wins all the events, partly due to the yellow and red teams cheating against each other, and partly due to Papa Smurf's formula. During the last event, the marathon, Weakling Smurf feels too tired to continue, but sits on ivy and runs away, winning the race. However, Weakling Smurf refuses the medal, saying that, since he used Papa Smurf's formula, he won cheating. Papa Smurf explain the formula was just fruit jelly, so he won fair and square both the medal and Smurfette's kiss, but before he gets the kiss, Brainy Smurf reveals he has a last card for Smurfette: a pink card, so Smurfette decides to walk away with Brainy instead. = In Other Media= *An animated version of The Olympic Smurfs entitled The Smurfic Games aired on NBC Television in 1984 (The same year that the 1984 Summer Olympic Games took place in Los Angeles California and is loosely based on The Olympic Smurfs).

After poor performance, and arson destroying the Arup S-3 follow-on, Hoffman returned to Arup to develop the Arup S-4. Hoffman's aircraft The aircraft which Hoffman designed during his absence from Arup was of similar tailless semi-circular \\"heel wing\\" configuration to the Arup designs. It is sometimes mistakenly described as a flying wing, but in fact it has a pronounced fuselage nacelle protruding above and forward of the wing. =Design and development= The chord of Hoffman's own design spanned from the rear of the cowling along the entire fuselage of the aircraft. The thickness of the wing was up to at the root. From the top the wing appeared semi-circular with a slightly swept leading edge. The aircraft used a conventional taildragger configuration with retractable landing gear. The center section and controls were welded steel tubing, and the rest was spruce wood with aircraft fabric covering. =Operational history= The test aircraft used fixed landing gear for trials. Test flights were successful, with the aircraft winning an impromptu race against a conventional aircraft. Visibility was noted as poor compared to conventional aircraft. During later 1936 testing, the prototype caught fire and crashed, killing its test pilot. =Specifications= See also References * Tailless aircraft ","title":"Raoul Hoffman"},{"id":"31470948","text":"Sir Ralph Sydenham (died 1671) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1641 to 1642.

There were many types issued in Scotland in the 18th and 19th centuries, but they were largely superseded by communion cards. Communion tokens were first suggested in 1560 by John Calvin and Pierre Viret in Geneva, and although the city council rejected the practice, the following year their idea was implemented in N√Æmes and Le Mans. By 1586 communion tokens were in use at the Walloon church in Amsterdam. However, most were issued in Scotland, where over 5,000 types have been recorded. They were also issued in many other countries, especially Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. Tokens were also issued by Presbyterian churches in Corfu, Florence, Hartslog, Madeira, Port Louis, Bombay, Cochin, Berbice, Demerara and Kingston, Jamaica.Pictured in Communion Tokens Melbourne: Hawthorn Press, 1964. Most tokens are from the 19th century, but R. M.

Raymond Mentzer says that \\"to avoid profanation of the Eucharist, the elders in the role as moral watchdogs distributed these entry counters to those members of the faithful whom they deemed qualified by virtue of correct belief and proper conduct.\\" The distribution of the tokens would normally be preceded by catechetical instruction. The Glens of Antrim Historical Society notes that \\"from the end of the nineteenth century metal tokens were gradually replaced by communion cards and rules regarding admission to the Lord‚Äôs Table were eased, allowing visitors who were members of other denominations, on profession of their faith to communicate.\\" Many tokens have verses on them, such as \\"This do in remembrance of me\\" (1 Corinthians 11:24) or \\"Let a man examine himself\\" (1 Corinthians 11:28). They were made of lead or another base metal, and came in a variety of shapes: round, oval, square or oblong. Earlier tokens had the ministers' initials on them, and many had the name of the church. When the Free Church of Scotland was formed in 1843, many tokens were issued with this year ‚Äì these were used as stock tokens in many congregations.

Luigi Wolff, also known as Louis Wolff or Adolfo Wolff, was an Italian revolutionary of German birth and Jewish ancestry. Life Adolfo Luigi Wolff was born in Augsburg, the son of Ludwig Alexander Wolff and Apollonia von Megenauer. The precise dates of his birth and death are uncertain, but he was probably alive between 1810 and 1875. In the 1830s he joined the French Foreign Legion and fought with distinction in the French conquest of Algeria (1830‚Äì47). Before 1849 he served in the Papal army. In 1848‚Äì1849 he participated in the Italian Revolution, and in 1856 he fought in the Crimean War as part of an Anglo-Italian contingent. During his adventurous youth, Wolff became a partisan of the Italian Risorgimento and a champion of Italian unification. In addition to nationalist and democratic ideas, he was influenced by utopian socialist doctrines. He became an associate of Giuseppe Mazzini and served as Mazzini's secretary from 1860 to 1870. In 1860‚Äì1862, Wolff fought with Giuseppe Garibaldi's troops in several campaigns. When he was not away fighting somewhere, Wolff usually resided in London. In the early 1860s he helped organise an association of Italian workers in London. In 1864, at Mazzini's suggestion, Wolff served as one of the Italian delegates to the newly founded First International. In 1864‚Äì1865, he served on its General Council. He was involved in drafting the International's rules and statutes, much to the dismay of Karl Marx, who deplored Mazzini's influence.Ironically, Marx was in those years encouraging the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin to set up workers' associations in Italy to rival Mazzini's; within a few years, the First International was to split over the conflict between Marx and Bakunin. (Marx eventually wrote the rules adopted by the International.) In 1865, Wolff withdrew from the General Council of the International. In 1865 he was imprisoned in Alexandria. In 1866 he volunteered once again for Garibaldi's forces and fought in the third Italian war of independence. He fought in the battle of Ponte Caffaro on 25 June and in the battle of Monte Suello on 3 July 1866. Wolff attained the rank of colonel and was given the medal of valour after Italy achieved her independence. However, in 1871, after the fall of the Second French Empire, documents found in Paris apparently proved that Wolff had been a paid informer of the imperial police of Napol√©on III. This damaged Wolff's reputation among Italian nationalists, who never forgave Napol√©on III for his attack on the Roman revolutionaries in 1849, and among socialists and trade unionists, who remembered the persecution of their French comrades. Wolff disappeared after this and was not heard from again. Sources * Marx, K., 'On Mazzini‚Äôs Attitude to The International Working Men‚Äôs Association.'

Eventually the plan is for the Menunkatuck Trail to be extended to Long Island Sound (possibly via some road walks) but the trail currently is approximately directly due north of Guilford Harbor (and approximately due north of US I-95.). The trail walk can be extended southward from just outside the waste site on Sullivan Drive by following a red-orange plastic ribbon marked trail through the Guilford town-owned East River Preserve to a trailhead on Clapboard Hill Road north of the intersection with Meadowlands.

Trail description This bridge over a stream in the Guilford section of the Cockaponset State Forest is this young man's Eagle Scout project. The Menunkatuck Trail is primarily used for hiking, backpacking, picnicking, and in the winter, snowshoeing. Portions of the trail are suitable for, and are used for, cross-country skiing and geocaching. Site- specific activities enjoyed along the route include bird watching, hunting (very limited), fishing, horseback riding, bouldering and rock climbing (limited). =Trail communities= The official Blue-Blazed Menunkatuck Trail passes through land located within the following municipalities, from south to north: History and folklore The Blue-Blazed Menunkatuck Trail was created by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. Hiking the trail The mainline trail is blazed with blue rectangles. Trail descriptions are available from a number of commercial and non-commercial sources, and a complete guidebook is published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association Weather along the route is typical of Connecticut. Conditions on exposed ridge tops and summits may be harsher during cold or stormy weather.NOAA Lightning is a hazard on exposed summits and ledges during thunderstorms. Snow is common in the winter and may necessitate the use of snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking dangerous without special equipment. Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic deer ticks (which are known to carry Lyme disease) are a potential hazard. Wearing bright orange clothing during the hunting season (Fall through December) is recommended. Conservation and maintenance of the trail corridor A large portion of the Menunkatuck Trail passes through or near protected wetlands: bogs, swamps, vernal ponds and marsh lands. Wooden walkways are planned to allow easy passage over some of these which flood or become muddy often. There are sections of the trail which are narrow forested easements between streets of substantial houses. These protected green spaces are often 'set asides' created during residential housing development. Much of the trail is protected, owned and managed by either the Town of Guilford (often by the Conservation Committee), the Guilford Conservation Land Trust or the state (as a part of the Cockaponset State Forest). Land owned by the Regional Water Authority and private owners is not necessarily nor specifically protected but temporary easements have been negotiated to allow the trail to pass through these properties.

This law is one of the twenty-four kohanic gifts and, of those twenty- four, as one of ten gifts given to the priest even outside the land of Israel.Tosefta Challah 2:8, Talmud Bavli Hullin According to Abba Jose ben Hanan, the nuances of the herem laws (as well as laws of hekdesh and arakhin, and five other categories of laws) are considered \\"eight pillars of Torah law\\" that are \\"principles of Halakha\\".Tosefta Hagigah 1:11  Etymology  In Hebrew the adjective herem (Hebrew ◊ó÷µ◊®÷∂◊ù) means \\"devoted thing\\" or \\"thing devoted to destruction\\". The term is used 29 times in the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh. An unrelated homonym, the noun herem meaning \\"fisherman's net\\" (also ◊ó÷µ◊®÷∂◊ù), is used a further 9 times.Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew Lexicon The adjective herem and the associate verb haram (\\"devote\\") come from the Semitic root ·∏§-R-M, with cognates in the Syriac and Arabic languages. The word \\"devoted\\" (herem) is understood by Maimonides as a \\"complete and total transition\\" from one status to another.Rambam l'am, hilkhoth arakhin v'hromin chap. 6 note 2. Mossad Harav Kook, Jerusalem The Targums define the word as a complete separation.Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to Numbers 18:13; Targum Yonathan to Isaiah 43:28 According to Samuel ben Meir, this is the complete transition of an estate or object from hullin (mundane) status to that of kodesh (holy).Samuel ben Meir Commentary on Numbers 21:2  Sources  The first of two sources of the commandment is stated in Leviticus: A second source, however, explicitly instructs that the devoted thing be given to the priest; To reconcile the seemingly incompatible instructions in the Biblical verses, the Tosefta explains them as detailing two types of devoted things: hermei gavoah (devoted things specifically consecrated by their owner to the Temple in Jerusalem) and hermei kohanim (devoted things to be given the priest, as the estate or object was not designated by its owner to the Temple in Jerusalem).Tosefta Arachin 4:13 = \\"Devoted property\\" in the territory of Joseph = Malbim, a 19th century Bible commentator, explained as referring to the practice of herem. According to him, the tribe of Joseph desired the merit that Eleazar the high priest should be buried in their territory. Thus, when he died they designated Givat Pinchas (modern Awarta) as a herem estate; that is to be given the priests currently in duty as per the priestly divisions), and calculated to publicize the herem designation during the division cycle when Pinchas was in service, thus increasing the likelihood of Pinchas burying his father in the herem property, which ultimately happened.Malbim on Joshua 24:33  Ideas behind the commandment  The Sifra describes the commandment to devote things as enabling the Israelite to do perform a commandment with objects that otherwise do not have a commandment attached to them. For example a non-kosher animal other than the firstborn of a donkey, by way of the Israelite making his possession thereof herem, he elevates it to holiness.Sifra 42b as quoted in Midrash HaGadol to Leviticus 8:25 Maimonides describes the act of creating a \\"devoted\\" estate a worthy act, since it goes against the sin of miserhood. In addition, he also categorizes the initiation of devoted goods by an Israelite as an act of respect and honor to the God of Israel.Maimonides Mishneh Torah, hilkhot arakhin vehromim 8:12 Raya Mehemna (a conversation between Moses and Elijah found as an addition to the Zohar) describes herem as rectifying and healing the negative emotion of anger the initiator of a devotion of property may possess.Raya mehemna 3 p. 179a The Sifre argues that the priests' right to herem is a reward for Jochebed (mother of Aaron, the first priest) for rescuing the infants of Israel from the pharaonic decree of infanticide of Israelite newborns: Rabbinic laws = Undesignated herem = Opinions differ as to what is done with herem in cases where the initiator of herem did not designate whether the property is consecrated to the Temple or to the priests (stam herem). Maimonides opines that this undesignated herem be given the priests by default. Maimonides further states that undesignated devoted property is considered mundane (hullin) and may be used by the priests for personal needs. This is in contrast to the case where the person does designate his herem to be given the priests, in which case the herem retains a holy (kodesh) state and cannot be used for personal needs.Maimonides Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot arakhin v-cheremin 6:1-4 = Dispension to the mishmaroth = Allocation of herem may depend on the type of the object devoted; whether it is real estate or goods. According to Rav Sheshet, devotion of real estate is considered one of the four priestly gifts that is divided among the serving priestly division (mishmar kehuna), while tangible devoted goods are appropriated even to an individual priest not currently in active Temple service.Yerushalmi Hallah 27b  In modern times  The herem commandment, although practice infrequently today, still has halakhic implication in modern times: = In the diaspora = Considering that herem is listed as one of the ten priestly gifts that can be given to a priest outside of Jerusalem (similar to the Pidyon HaBen and the giving of the shoulder, cheeks and maw), some poskim have noted that both types of devoted things, both real estate and goods, are designated and given to the priest of the beit din's choice.Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot arakhin v-hromin 8:11 (as per Ulla, quoted in Arakhin 29a) Solomon Luria is of the opinion that the dedicator of herem is required to specify that the property be given to a priest, in order for a priest to be eligible as the recipient. In terms of the beit din choosing an eligible priest, Rabbi Luria opines that the status quo Kohen is sufficient to be the recipient of a devoted item and it to be \\"mundane\\" (hullin).Solomon Luria on Bava Kamma end of minor chapter 35  References  Priesthood (Judaism) Positive Mitzvoth ","title":"Herem (priestly gift)"},{"id":"31471082","text":"Stanislav Prychynenko (, born 26 June 1991) is a Ukrainian football defender.

Biographical summary  Donald J. DePaolo was born in 1951. He grew up in upstate New York.  Career  DePaolo received his B.S. degree with Honors in Geology from Binghamton University in 1973 and earned his Ph.D. in geology with a minor in chemistry under Gerald Wasserburg at the California Institute of Technology in 1978. In the same year, DePaolo began an assistant professorship at the University of California, Los Angeles Department of Geology and Geochemistry and subsequently earned his associate (1981‚Äì1983) and full professorship (1983‚Äì1988). In 1988, he began his term as Professor of Geochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science, with a joint appointment as a Faculty Scientist in the Earth Sciences Division at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) [1]. Upon his arrival in Berkeley, Dr. DePaolo established the Center for Isotope Geochemistry, a joint research facility between LBNL and UC Berkeley [2]. In 1998, he was made the Class of 1951 Professor of Geochemistry, and served as chair of the department from 1990 to 1993. From 1998-2006 DePaolo served as Geochemistry Department Head at LBNL, in 2007 he became Earth Sciences Division Director and from 2010-2011 he served as Acting Associate Laboratory Director for Energy and Environmental Sciences before accepting the position permanently on April 1, 2011. In Spring of 2009, DePaolo became the Director of the Center for Nanoscale Control of Geologic CO2 (EFRC) [3].  Research interests  DePaolo has coauthored over 170 peer-reviewed articles and reviews. His research interests focus on using naturally occurring isotope variations to explore questions such as * Origin of the deep-source Hawaiian plume and other hotspots and theories on mantle dynamics [4] * Tracking fluids moving through groundwater systems, with application to tracing contaminants * Understanding isotope fractionation of molten materials * Magma chamber processes and life cycles of volcanoes * Isotopic evidence that may lead to detecting life on other planets * Chronology studies of both difficult-to-date young volcanic rocks and ancient continental rocks * Isotopic composition of old ocean sediments, with implications for climate shifts Major contributions In his early career, DePaolo pioneered the use of samarium and neodymium isotope ratios to constrain the age and chemical evolution of rocks. DePaolo and his then advisor Gerald Wasserburg made the first Nd isotope measurements on terrestrial igneous rocks [5]. An important byproduct of this work was the development of epsilon notation (Œµ), with which initial 143Nd/144Nd values could be distinguished from the chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR) in parts per ten thousand. Key principles of the Nd isotope system were laid out in his 1988 book, Neodymium Isotope Geochemistry: An Introduction. DePaolo's work has since led to significant advances in using various isotope systems to constrain rates of metamorphic processes [6], quantify continental weathering and elemental seawater budgets through geologic time [7][8], and model fluid-rock interactions [9]. As principal investigator of the Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP), DePaolo and coworkers sampled the flank of Mauna Kea volcano to a depth of several kilometers. Major findings included a determination of the geochemical structure of the Hawaiian mantle plume [10]. DePaolo‚Äôs recent research provides a framework for understanding the partitioning of stable isotopes during mineral growth, with a focus on isotopes of calcium [11].

Plyboo was launched as a brand in 1993 by Smith&Fong;, the first U.S. company to sell imported bamboo flooring in North America. Although Smith&Fong; Co. is the parent company, Plyboo has come to be how the company is primarily identified.  History  Dan Smith and James Fong founded Smith & Fong in 1989 as a design/manufacturer of art-craft quality bamboo pieces. The company's puzzle boxes, trays and tea canisters were sold at Gump's in San Francisco, the New York Museum of Modern Art, the Chicago Art Institute and other boutiques and retailers nationwide. Four years later Smith & Fong converted a Chinese tea-processing plant to produce bamboo flooring and worked out a distribution agreement with a Bay Area-based flooring distributor. Under the name Plyboo, Smith & Fong was the first company to bring bamboo flooring to the US market. The first product was an amber flat-grain flooring that is still in stock today. In 1996, Angus Stocks joined Smith & Fong as an equity partner. The company leased its own space and took possession of its inventory. A second color of bamboo flooring (natural) was added, and the company introduced architectural-grade bamboo plywood to the marketplace. Smith & Fong incorporated in 1997, and spent the remainder of the 1990s adding more bamboo flooring and plywood options to its Plyboo offerings. In 2000, the company launched bamboo strand flooring; in 2001, Smith & Fong introduced coconut palm plywood and flooring under the Durapalm brand, and bamboo plywood production moved to a 4‚Äôx8‚Äô dimension. The company ventured into the sports floor market with PlybooSport in 2006 with its first installation in Dallas, Texas, where Smith & Fong first launched its flooring business 13 years prior. In 2007, Smith & Fong announced it would be converting its manufacturing operations to run urea formaldehyde-free adhesives (PlybooPure‚Ñ¢) on its plywood, flooring and veneer lines. Plyboo's product lines are now available urea formaldehyde-free throughout North America. All Smith & Fong products undergo third-party lab-testing for emissions compliance. The products pass the California Air Resources Board (CARB)'s formaldehyde regulations for composite panels. All standard PlybooPure flooring and sheet goods have passed California's Section 01350 volatile organic compound (VOC)-emissions testing. CA01350 is the strictest indoor air quality criteria in existence. Most Smith & Fong products earn the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Credit MRc6 for Rapidly Renewable Materials, EQ 4.4: No Added Urea Formaldehyde for plywood and EQ 4.3 for flooring. In 2008, Smith & Fong obtained the world's first non-wood FSC (Forrest Stewardship Council) certification for its bamboo resource in China, providing third-party validation of a truly sustainable industry. Later that year PlybooPure FSC- certified bamboo flooring was selected as a \\"Top-10 Green Building Product\\" by BuildingGreen, publisher of Environmental Building News, the architecture and design industry's most respected source of information on sustainable building and design.  Today  Today Smith & Fong Plyboo offers more than 50 types of bamboo plywood, about 25 choices of bamboo flooring, and a variety of tambour paneling and bamboo veneers.

Frequency-dependent foraging is defined as the tendency of an individual to selectively forage on a certain species or morph based on its relative frequency within a population.Levin 1972. Low frequency disadvantage in the exploitation of pollinators by corolla variants in Phlox. Am. Nat., 106: 453-460.

Additionally, frequency-dependent foraging differs from density- dependent foraging as the latter considers the absolute number of certain morphs per unit area as a factor influencing pollinator choice.Bosch, M and NM Waser. 1999. Effects of local density on pollination and reproduction in Delphinium nuttallianum and Aconitum columbianum (Ranunculaceae). Am. J. Bot. 86: 871-879. Although density of a morph will be related to its frequency, common morphs are still preferred when overall plant densities are high.Smithson, A and MR Macnair. 1997a.

Learning in honey bees in an ecological and behavioural context. 55-74. In B Holldobler and M Lindauer (Eds.). Experimental Behavioral Ecology. Stuttgart: Gustav Fischer. As pollinators are essential in the process of pollen transfer (and therefore, reproductive success) of many angiosperms, visitation behavior will impose frequency-dependent selection on the flower morphs that they visit. If pollinators selectively visit a particular morph, this will cause this morph to increase in frequency, and may ultimately lead to the fixation of this phenotype,Thompson, V. 1984. Polymorphism under apostatic and aposematic selection. Heredity, 53: 677-686. known as directional selection. Alternatively, if rare morphs are preferred, this should promote phenotypic diversity, known as balancing or stabilizing selection.Clarke, B. 1962a. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species, 47-70. In D Nichols (Ed.). Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.Clark, B. 1962b. Natural selection in mixed populations of two polymophyic snails. Heredity, 17: 319-345. Interest in frequency-dependent selection dates back to the time of Charles Darwin, who predicted that insects should demonstrate floral constancyDarwin, C. 1876. The effects of cross- and self-fertilization in the animal kingdom. and puzzled over the occurrence of deceptive orchid species.Darwin, C. 1888. Fertilisation of orchids: the various contrivances by which orchids are fertilised by insects, 2nd ed. London: John Murray. This phenomenon received little attention until the 1970s when Donald Levin suggested that one of the most important factors determining pollinator visitation behavior is the floral trait's frequency in the population relative to other floral elements. Since this time, attention has focussed on understanding how obligately pollinated, unrewarding species can persist as they offer pollinators no incentive to visit.Smithson, A and MR Macnair. 1997b. Negative frequency-dependent selection by pollinators on artificial flowers without rewards. Evolution, 51: 715-723. Much less research has been conducted on frequency-dependent foraging on rewarding species, but experiments using bumblebees have illustrated that frequency likely plays a role in reproductive success of flowering plants.Smithson, A and MR Macnair. 1996.

Bumblebee with tongue extracted about to visit a Heuchera plant for nectar. Experimental evidence Researchers studying frequency-dependent visitation behavior seek to understand if pollinator preference is strong enough to induce fixation of traits or to maintain floral polymorphisms observed in natural populations.Smithson, A. 2001. Pollinator preference, frequency dependence, and floral evolution. 237-258. In LD Chittka and JD Thomson (Eds.). Cognitive ecology of pollination: animal behaviour and floral evolution. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press Laboratory experiments use artificial flowers to test how pollinator preference varies with frequency. Typical experiments use two or more colored discs or artificial flowers (to represent flower morphs) that are arranged in various patterns and frequencies. It is predicted that if pollinators do not exhibit frequency- dependent foraging, morph preference will not correlate with the relative frequency of that morph. Instead, this preference may depend on some frequency-independent quality, such as an innate attraction toward a certain color.Lunau, K and EJ Maier. 1995. Innate colour preferences of flower visitors. J. Comp. Physiol. A., 177: 1-19. Honeybee on a blue flower. =Bumblebees= Laboratory experiments Frequency-dependent foraging has most often been observed and studied in bumblebees (Bombus) as they tend to forage for long periods of time without becoming satiated, making them ideal experimental subjects. Simple experiments using two morphs have revealed that after visiting many flowers (more than 100) bumblebees tend to prefer to visit the common morph when rewards associated with both morphs are equal. This pattern is consistent for a variety of nectar concentrations. An exception to this pattern occurs when one morph contains variable amounts of nectar. This reward variability tends to cause the strength of the observed frequency dependence to decrease. However, when both rare and common morphs are unrewarding, bumblebees tend to reverse their behavioral pattern and demonstrate rare morph preference. Corolla morphs may not be as distinctly colored in natural populations as they are in laboratory experiments. Even though these experiments demonstrate that bumblebees forage in a frequency- dependent manner, the strength of this response can be asymmetric for different colors. For example, experiments using blue and yellow discs to represent corolla colors demonstrated that, although bumblebees preferentially foraged on the most common morph when rewards were present, the threshold for switching to the common morph was different for both colors. Bumblebees exhibit an innate preference for blue corollas, as this color is very conspicuous to bees against green-colored backgrounds. It was observed that in order for bees to switch from blue flowers to yellow, the yellow-to-blue ratio had to be much higher than the ratio of blue-to-yellow flowers that were required for the opposite switch. In other words, bees would forage on blue flowers until morphs of this colour reached relatively lower frequencies compared to yellow flowers. However, this preference for blue was not as pronounced when both morphs contained high levels of nectar. Therefore, frequency-dependent preferences must be considered along-with frequency- independent preferences to truly understand the visitation behavior of pollinators. Additionally, when density of equally rewarding color morphs were manipulated, bumblebees still preferred to forage on the common morphs, even at high densities. Field experiments Experiments conducted in the field have yielded mixed results. Some studies have demonstrated that bumblebees prefer the relatively common corolla color,Epperson, BK and MT Clegg. 1987. Frequency-dependent variation for outcrossing rate among flower- color morphs of Ipomoea purpurea. Evolution, 41: 1302-1311. but in other studies there did not appear to be any observable pattern of bee visitation behavior.Jones, KN. 1996. Pollinator behavior and postpollination reproductive success in alternative floral phenotypes of Clarkia gracilis (Onagraceae). Int J Plant Sci., 157: 733-738. This discrepancy between laboratory and field studies may be due to the fact that laboratory studies use highly contrasting corolla colors and it is likely that color polymorphisms in the wild are not this distinct, making frequency-dependence weaker in natural settings. Additionally, in natural populations multiple traits that are attractive to pollinators may be genetically correlated with one another (pleiotropyWaser, NM and MV Price. 1981. Pollinator choice and stabolizing selection for flower color in Delphinium nelsonii. Evolution, 35: 376-390.), so looking at pollinator response to a single trait in isolation may not be appropriate under these circumstances. Also, frequency-dependent foraging is not apparent until many flowers have been visited (more than 100). Therefore, considering morph frequency within localized patches of flowers in natural settings may not be sufficient. Instead, morph frequency may need to be calculated over large spatial ranges to determine the extent to which pollinators are foraging in a frequency-dependent manner. A monarch butterfly drinking nectar from a Zinnia flower. =Other insects= Although studies of frequency-dependent foraging in other pollinator groups seems to be rare, at least one study has demonstrated that butterflies prefer to visit common corolla shapes. This observation was based on reduced seed set of rare morphs in field studies. Mechanisms =Positive frequency-dependent foraging= Foraging on common morphs will be beneficial if these common morphs are associated with a higher reward than rare morphs. However, if rare morphs have similar nectar quality, skipping over these equally rewarding flowers appears to be inconsistent with optimal foraging theory.MacArthur, RH and ER Pianka. 1966. On the optimal use of a patchy environment. Am. Nat., 100. Several hypotheses have been proposed to suggest how this visitation pattern is maintained. Search image hypothesis It has been observed that predators tend to select the most common morph in a population or species.Allen, JA. 1988. Frequency-dependent selection by predators. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 319: 485-503. The search image hypothesis proposes that an individual's sensory system becomes better able to detect a specific prey phenotype after recent experience with that same phenotype.Tinbergen, L. 1960. The natural control of insects in pinewoods. I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds. Arch. Neerl. Zool., 13: 265-343. It is clear that plant-pollinator interactions differ from predator-prey relationships, as it is beneficial to both the plant and animal for the pollinator to locate the plant. However, it has been suggested that cognitive constraints on short-term memory capabilities may limit pollinators from identifying and handling more than one floral type at a time,Dukas, R and LA Real. 1993. Learning constraints and floral choice behaviour in bumble bees. Anim. Behav., 46: 637-644.Chittka, L and JD Thomson. 1997. Sensori-moyor learning and its relevance for task specialization in bumble bees. Behav Ecol Sociobiol., 41: 385-398. making plant-pollinator relationships theoretically similar to predator-prey relationships in regards to the ability to identify food sources. Although plant traits that have evolved to attract pollinators are not cryptic, corolla colors can be more or less conspicuous with the backgroundMenzel, R and A Shmida. 1993. The ecology of flower colours and the natural colour vision of insect pollinators. The Israeli flora as a case study. Biol. Rev., 68: 81-120. and pollinators that are more efficient at detecting a particular morph will minimize their search time. Studies have demonstrated that the degree of frequency-dependence increases with the number of flowers visited, which suggests this is a learned response that develops gradually. Flower morphs may differ in their relative conspicuousness against the background. Search rate hypotheses Alternative mechanisms, such as the optimal search rate hypothesisGendron, RP and JER Staddon. 1983. Searching for cryptic prey: the effect of search rate. Am. Nat., 121: 172-186. and the stare duration hypothesisEndler, JA. 1991. Interactions between predators and prey, 169-196. In JR Krebs and NB Davies (Eds.). Behavioural Ecology, and Evolutionary Approach. 3rd edition. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford. both propose that there is a tradeoff between search time and the probability of detecting prey. It has been demonstrated that when both density and frequency were manipulated, the strength of the preference for the common morph does not weaken with increased overall density, even when colors that are not innately preferred are the common morph. These results are consistent with both of these search time hypotheses, as bees tend to decrease their speed travelling between flowers when density is high, and therefore, may be more efficient at recognizing less conspicuous yellow flowers at lower speeds. Switching attention hypothesis Studies on other organisms have provided evidence that foraging can occur in long runs, but this preference develops after only visiting a few morphs.Dawkins, M. 1971. Shifts of 'attention' in chicks during feeding. Anim. Behav., 19: 575-582. When presented with two equally rewarding morphs, it has been demonstrated that an organism may select to exclusively forage on one morph for a variable amount of time, and then switch to the alternative morph and repetitively forage on this morph. Under this switching attention hypothesis, selectively foraging on the common morph can occur without invoking a learned response, as the probability of visiting a particular morph first increases as the relative frequency of that morph increases. In other words, it is likely pollinators will select common morphs first due to chance since they are more common and will continue to forage on these morphs during foraging bouts. =Negative frequency-dependent foraging= Pollinators appear to forage in a negative frequency-dependent manner when flowers do not provide nectar rewards, likely to avoid unrewarding morphs. This behaviour results in disassortative mating between different morph types. However, it seems likely that deceptive species would have low reproductive success as pollinators would learn to avoid areas where only unrewarding species are present.Gumbert, A and J Kunze. 2001. Colour similarity to rewarding model plants affects pollination in a food deceptive orchid, Orchis boryi. Biol J Linn Soc., 72: 419-433. A deceptive orchid, Dactylorhiza sambucina, does not provide a nectar reward for its pollinaors. Naive pollinators One hypothesis as to how unrewarding species can persist in the population is that they only receive visits from naive pollinators.Nilsson, LA. 1980. The pollination ecology of Dactylorhiza sambucina (Orchidaceae). Botaniska Notiser, 133: 367-385. As pollinators do not appear to be able to distinguish between rewarding and unrewarding flowers prior to landing,Thomson, JD. 1986. Pollen transport and deposition by bumble bees in Erythronium ‚Äì Influences of floral nectar and bee grooming. J. Ecology, 74: 329-341. they need to make test visits so they can learn to avoid particular morph types.Heinrich, B. 1975. Bee flowers: a hypothesis on flower variety and blooming times. Evolution, 29: 325-334. When a preferred rewarding morph type becomes locally depleted, pollinators may be initially attracted to unrewarding morphs if these morphs exploit signals that are innately attractive or closely mimic rewarding species.Dafni, A. 1984. Mimicry and deception in pollination. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics. 15: 259-278. However, under this hypothesis, the pollinator should learn to associate this morph with no reward and consequently avoid it on future foraging bouts. Negative frequency-dependent selection A different hypothesis does not assume that only naive pollinators visit deceptive species. Instead, the negative reinforcement associated with visiting an unrewarding flower is assumed to be stored in short-term memory. This causes the pollinator to go to a different morph type on its next visit. In other words, if deceptive species were to occur at a low enough frequency that pollinators do not encounter them very often, it is unlikely they will have the opportunity to relocate this information to their long-term memory. Studies have shown that the number of flowers of an unrewarding morph type that are sampled depends on the frequency of those morphs within a population. For example, many species of obligately animal-pollinated, deceptive orchids that co-occur with rewarding flowers are only reproductively successful when they occur at low frequencies. It is worth mentioning that these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive in that morph populations that are visited by naive pollinators are also likely to be found at low frequencies relative to rewarding morphs. Implications Regardless of the mechanism, pollinators foraging in a frequency-dependent manner on common morphs will lead to assortative mating between similar phenotypes.Stanton, ML. 1987. Reproductive biology of petal colour variants in wild populations of Raphanus saticus: I. Pollinator response to color morphs. Am. J. Bot., 74: 178-187. Additionally, rare morphs may be at a disadvantage if reproductive success is correlated with number of pollinator visits, and this may lead to higher rates of selfing and ultimately inbreeding depression, in self-compatible plants. The potential for a decrease in genetic diversity due to assortative mating can have negative implications. Lady orchid (left) and naturally occurring lady/monkey hybrid (right). =Climate change= In response to climate change, plants may begin to flower earlier in the season due to regional aridification and a rise in mean global temperature.IPCC. 2007. Climate change 2007: the physical science basis. Contribution of working group I to the fourth assessment report of the IPCC. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University press. However, reproductive success of flowering plants that are obligately pollinated ultimately depends on a corresponding change in the timing of pollinator visitors.Forrest, J and JD Thomson. 2008. Pollinator experience, neophobia and the evolution of flowering time. Proc. R. Soc. B, 276: 935-943. The earliest bloomers of any species will be rare since the majority of conspecific plants have not yet flowered. Since many pollinators prefer to forage on common phenotypes, the flowers that bloom earliest in the season may be skipped. This may lead to a constraint on plant flowering evolution and the inability of flowering plants to adapt to changing environmental conditions. =Hybrid zones= Additionally, positive frequency-dependent foraging may help maintain hybrid zones between closely related species.Tastard, E, C Andalo, M Giurfa, M Burrus and C Thebaud. 2008. Flower colour variation across a hybrid zone in Antirrhinum as perceived by bumblebee pollinators. Arthropod- Plant Interactions, 2: 237-246. Hybrid zones generally contain a wide variety of phenotypes, including novel or extremely rare morphs. Since certain pollinators tend to prefer common morphs, there is a low probability that they will visit rare morphs in the hybrid zone, thus keeping gene flow between species relatively low.

Misty's primary mission was to fly F-100s at low altitudes and locate enemy targets along the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos. There were 155 pilots assigned to fly the Misty between June 1967 and May 1970. Of the 155 Mistys, 34 were shot down. Clapper was shot down during an early morning Misty sortie and was at the center of a daring and dangerous day-long rescue mission, after which he received a Purple Heart. He is also a leading attorney in litigation concerning mesothelioma. Early life and education Jack Clapper was born on November 2, 1939 in Ottawa, Illinois. He attended Ottawa Township High School and graduated in 1956. In 1959, after one year at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, he joined the United States Air Force. Air Force career In 1959, Clapper completed a program called Aviation Cadets, which allowed qualified applicants to become officers without having graduated from a four-year college or university. In 1960 he was a navigator on B-52s and was stationed at Walker AFB in Roswell, New Mexico. Clapper subsequently was promoted to First Lieutenant and also became a radar navigator. As a result of outstanding performance, he was promoted early to the rank of Captain in 1964. One of his assignments included Operation Chrome Dome in which he flew 24 hours carrying nuclear bombs in case of a potential Russian attack during the Cold War. These missions required navigation in the vicinity of the North Pole using celestial navigation, long before GPS had become available. While flying as a radar navigator, Clapper earned his civilian pilot's license in Roswell, New Mexico. In 1967, Clapper was accepted into the Air Force pilot training program at Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock, Texas. The training began with flying Cessna 172s, and then progressed to the T-37, a small twin-engine jet, nicknamed the \\"Tweety-bird\\", because of the high-pitched sound of the engine. Clapper learned to do basic maneuvers, steep turns, and fly in formation. After four months, Clapper began to train in twin-engine supersonic jets called the T-38 Talons. The T-38 had tandem seating, flew very fast, and was extremely maneuverable. Clapper learned to fly aerobatics, including loops, aileron rolls, Immelmans, and barrel rolls in the T-38. He also was trained and became qualified to fly under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). ;F-100 pilot Clapper graduated at the top of his pilot training class and was given his choice of assignments. He chose Cannon AFB in Clovis, New Mexico so he could fly F-100s, the Air Force's first supersonic fighter jet. The F-100 Super Saber was a sleek, swept-back-wing, supersonic jet fighter built by North American Aviation. About 2000 F-100s were built before production ended in 1959. The Air Force chose F-100Ds to perform throughout the world in aerial precision flights. The USAF Thunderbirds flight demonstration team operated F-100Ds from July 1964 until November 1968. Over 19 million people viewed the famed \\"Thunderbirds,\\" a six aircraft team, as they performed precision airborne maneuvers.''' The F-100D was a single-engine, single-seat fighter jet. Intended to be a fighter-bomber, the plane was equipped with weapons and in-flight refueling systems. In training to fly the F-100, Clapper learned how to make precision weapons delivery involving bombs, rockets and strafing. He also became proficient in refueling in-flight from a KC-135 aircraft. Vietnam In November 1968, Clapper was sent to the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Tuy Hua Air Force Base in the Republic of Vietnam. Tuy Hua is on the shore of the South China Sea, just north of Cam Rahn Bay. Clapper was assigned to attack enemy targets, such as bridges, river barges, road junctions, and areas used by infiltrating enemy soldiers. His initial missions, known as \\"sorties,\\" were mainly short flights in South Vietnam, sometimes to repel enemy attacks on our soldiers who were under attack on the ground. =Joining Misty FAC= In September 1969, Clapper joined the Misty FAC (forward air controller) program. Misty's primary mission was to fly F-100s at low altitudes and locate enemy targets along the Ho Chi Minh trail, mainly in Laos. Misty was an all-volunteer organization that flew F-100Fs, a tandem two-seat model ‚Äìhaving two pilots allowed for an additional set of eyes to look for targets. There were 155 pilots assigned to fly the Misty between June 1967 and May 1970, when Misty disbanded. Of the 155 Mistys, 34 were shot down. There were seven killed in action and four prisoners of war. One Misty was awarded the Medal of Honor, two became Air Force Chief of Staff, two became astronauts, and one was later the first man to fly non-stop, un-refueled flight around the world. =Sortie Flight - October 1969= ;Mayday Call In October 1969, Clapper and co-pilot Don Muller were flying the first Misty sortie, taking off early in the day, when they encountered enemy ground fire and their engine lost power. The stricken aircraft quickly descended to less than 1,000 feet above the terrain. They broadcast a \\"MAYDAY\\" call on the radio prior to ejecting and parachuted down into the mountainous Laotian jungle terrain. The approximate time was 8 a.m. ;Clapper and Muller on ground Clapper and Muller were separated by about one mile due to the programmed delay in the ejection sequence between the front and rear ejection seats. Each was equipped with a battery-powered radio and they were contacted by another FAC flying in the area that had heard their pre-ejection call and said that he would notify search and rescue. Muller informed Clapper and the FAC that his leg was badly broken and that he had heard movement nearby. ;C-130 rescue coordination The Air Force maintained an airborne C-130 (code name \\"King\\") for the purpose of coordinating the rescue of downed pilots. The C-130 had the capability of remaining in the air for long periods of time without refueling. Within less than two hours King first made radio contact with the two downed pilots and then called in two A-1 Skyraiders (code name \\"Stormy\\") to get a preliminary report on enemy activity in the area. A-1 aircraft are propeller driven and can remain airborne for lengthy periods without refueling. The A-1s made contact with the downed pilots and noted their respective positions under the canopied jungle. The A-1s flew over the site of the pilots without receiving fire. King decided to call in rescue helicopters. ;11 a.m. - Jolly Green Giant rescue attempt The Sikorsky CH-3C Jolly Green Giant helicopter was the primary rescue helicopter for the Air Force during the Vietnam War. The most important requirement for a search and rescue helicopter, in addition to long range, is its ability to mount a strong winch, or hoist, so the person being rescued can be lifted to safety. This is necessary because usually the helicopter cannot land, as the downed pilot may be in a heavily wooded area and may need to be lifted out through the trees. The winch was usually connected to a long cable‚Äîup to 300 feet‚Äî and could carry either a horse-collar rescue sling, a rescue basket, or, as used in Vietnam, a special heavy metal cone-like \\"canopy penetrator\\" to get through the tree branches. If the downed pilot were injured, a paramedic would be lowered down to assist the pilot into the device. The Jolly Green Giant was armed with a door gunner who used an M60 machine gun to suppress the enemy. Jolly Greens involved in rescue operations flew as a pair, with one going in low for the rescue and the second standing back in case the first encountered enemy fire. At about 11 a.m. the first Jolly Green came in. It was determined that Muller should be rescued first because of his broken leg. The Jolly Green hovered over Muller's position and lowered a paramedic. Then intense automatic weapon firing began and the helicopter was badly damaged. It managed to fly about a mile, leaving Muller and the paramedic on the ground, before crashing into a meadow. The second Jolly Green landed, picked up the crew and flew them safely away. ;F-4 air strikes King called in several flights of F-4 fighter jets to bomb and strafe the area. Stormy remained at the scene to help the F-4 pilots deliver their weapons near the downed pilots without actually hitting them. After about 45 minutes of bombing and strafing by the F-4s, the original Stormys were out of fuel and two new A-1s arrived as replacements. ;Muller's rescue The second rescue attempt by a new pair of Jolly Greens was successful in getting Muller and the paramedic on board, but came under heavy fire. The rescue winch apparatus was shot away and the helicopters abandoned the rescue, leaving Clapper on the ground alone. King called in almost another hour of multiple air strikes by jet fighters before asking Stormy to ascertain the enemy's capability. The Stormy aircraft drew automatic weapons fire as it flew over the area. ;Gas rescue attempt King then ordered a new method of rescuing pilots downed in Laos- the use of gas. The theory was to incapacitate everyone on the ground, including the downed pilot, and then to lower a paramedic wearing a gas mask to the ground to put the pilot into the Jolly Green rescue device. Fighter jets delivered the canisters of gas over the area. The canisters opened high in the trees and out spilled the gas. Clapper was incapacitated, but not made unconscious. There was no immediate fire as the Jolly Green hovered to attempt the rescue. However, the rotor wash quickly blew away the gas. The enemy recovered and opened fire. The Jolly Green was hit several times, but managed to escape the area without going down. It was now about 4 p.m., not long before darkness would curtail further rescue attempts. ;Joint air strike, rescue successful A tropical thunderstorm moved in and heavy rain fell for the next 30 minutes. After the storm subsided, King called in more air strikes by jet fighters before ordering another release of gas. The canisters again opened high in the trees and out spilled the gas. This time, due to the rain, the wetness in the trees and foliage caused the gas to linger. A Jolly Green flew over Clapper and lowered a canopy penetrator to him. He climbed onto the device and the helicopter quickly exited the area as soon as Clapper was clear of the trees. The gunner on the rescue helicopter pulled him in the door and the rescue was successfully concluded at around 6 p.m. Clapper received some injuries during the ejection and rescue and received a Purple Heart. Clapper was promoted to Major in 1970. He separated from active duty in 1974 to attend law school. =Nerve gas scandal= Later reports in the news speculated that sarin was used in rescues in Laos. CNN and TIME reported in 1998 that the gas dropped 28 years ago in Laos was the same nerve gas used in the 1995 terrorist attack in a Tokyo subway that killed a dozen people. Although the nerve gas had been in the U.S. arsenal for years, the official policy of the Nixon Administration was \\"no first use of lethal nerve gas in combat. However, Admiral Thomas Moorer, USN (ret.), who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in 1970, and other top military officials, confirmed the use of sarin in missions to rescue downed U.S. airmen during the Vietnam War. Moorer said that the use of the gas was justified under the circumstances. However, in a report entitled \\"Operation Tailwind Review,\\" dated July 16, 1998, the Air Force Historical Studies Office concluded that a form of tear gas known as CS, not sarin, was used in Laos during the Vietnam war. In the Air Force, CS had replaced the older, less potent CN tear gas. An Air Force directive defined CN as a \\"standard tear agent employed by law enforcement agencies\\" and CS as \\"an improved agent developed for military use.\\" The tear gas was delivered by A-1 aircraft which carried the gas in canisters called CBU-19s for delivery on the target. The downed pilot himself would be deliberately gassed in some cases. The \\"Operation Tailwind Review\\" report found that the rules in effect in 1969 identified the situations when the use of tear gas would be appropriate during search and rescue operations. Post-military career In 1978, Clapper received his Juris Doctor degree from Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, California. He is a pioneer in asbestos litigation and in 1980 founded one of the first law firms in California dedicated to representing victims of mesothelioma and other asbestos related diseases, many of whom are military veterans. He is a member of the American Trial Lawyers' Association, the California Association of Consumer attorneys, Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, and the San Francisco Trial Lawyers Association among other professional organizations. He and the attorneys working with him at Clapper, Patti, Schweizer & Mason have obtained substantial jury decisions, including several multimillion-dollar verdicts. Personal life Clapper became an avid jogger and sailor in the 1980s. He qualified for, and finished, the Boston Marathon. He also successfully finished the San Francisco and Avenue of the Giants marathons. His sailboat, Phantom, won the St. Francis Yacht Club Big Boat Series in 1990. In 1994 he and his wife, Merilou, sailed Phantom in the Pacific Cup, a race from San Francisco to Hawaii. He continues to make sailing trips to Mexico, Canada and ports along the western U.S. coast.

They subsequently became widely recognised after many of their members contributed to various overseas projects. History GSIEN was founded in the wake of the launch in 1974 of the Messmer Plan to switch all of France's electricity generation to nuclear power, which took place without public or parliamentary debate. The announcement of the Messmer Plan caused a split in the scientific community between those physicists (generally older) who favoured the plan, and those (generally younger) who were concerned about the potential risks, leading to l‚ÄôAppel des 400 (the appeal of the 400), a petition signed initially by over 400 scientists, and ultimately by around 4,000, expressing their concern over a number of issues including 'secrecy' and 'official propaganda'. GSIEN was created following this petition, inspired in part by model of the Union of Concerned Scientists in the United States, with the objective of disseminating information to 'prevent nuclear officials from turning information into propaganda'. In 1998 Monique Sen√©, nuclear physicist, one of GSIEN's co-founders and its president, was awarded the National Order of the Legion of Honour for her work as anti‚Äìnuclear power activist.Extrait de la Gazette 143/144 la Gazette Nucl√©aire, published 1995, accessed 2011-04-11 Activities =Publications= Since its first edition in June 1976,la Gazette Nucl√©aire, published June 1976, accessed 2011-04-11 GSIEN has published over 250 editions of its quarterly newsletter, la Gazette Nucl√©aire (the Nuclear Gazette).

It was composed in 2008 for the annual conference of the International Double Reed Society.  History  Graham Waterhouse composed Bright Angel for the IDRS Conference 2008 in Provo, Utah, and chose the theme of the composition to match the setting of the conference. He recalls a hike which he took, age nine, with his father William Waterhouse. In 1972, when the bassoonist taught for one year at Indiana University, they crossed the Grand Canyon from the North Rim to the South Rim, on the North Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail. Bright Angel was premiered by Michel Bettez, Richard Ramey, Richard Moore and Henry Skolnick, conducted by the composer, at the Brigham Young University. It was published by the German publisher Accolade (Warngau) in 2009 as Bright Angel f√ºr 3 Fagotte und Kontrafagott. Bright Angel was part of a concert The Proud Bassoon, celebrating William Waterhouse on 16 April 2011 in Wigmore Hall. It was performed by the Bassoon Quartet from the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, where William Waterhouse had been a teacher of bassoon and a curator of the instrument collection. The players were James Thomas, Linda Begbie and Stefano Canuti, bassoon, and Jonathan Jones, contrabassoon, lead by Canuti who is \\"International Chair in Bassoon\\" at the RNCM, and Professor at the Conservatorio Superior de Aragon. The performance was the premiere of Bright Angel in the United Kingdom. The composer's string trio Epitaphium, originally composed for his father's memorial service, was also part of the concert program.  Music  The composer comments: > The piece tries to reflect a sense of wonder and awe at both the majesty and > the brutality of Nature. Some of the contours (or recollections of them) are > mirrored in the variously undulating and jagged lines. Also recalled during > the composition were the perpetually shifting vistas, as well as the toil of > tramping out the dusty trail, stumbling over boulders, cowering during a > storm. The musical material is mostly contained within the opening motive, > first heard as a solitary voice, before recurring over a wide-spanning > accompaniment of arpeggios. The slow, reflective introduction gives way to a > faster section, based on an energetic, pulsating rhythm. It is to the > tranquil mood of the opening that the work eventually returns, closing on an > unresolved chord, to capture the eternity of the Canyon.

(The Bridge) is an American theater company based in New York City. It was incorporated by its Artistic Director, Avra Petrides, in 1980;Certificate of Incorporation, is dated April 21, 1980, and signed by the Secretary of State, Basil Paterson and has produced American/International music- theater festivals in the South of France (Languedoc-Roussillon region) with American musical-theater artists such as Alan Jay Lerner, lyricist and librettist of My Fair Lady, and Betty Comden and Adolph Green screenwriters and lyricists of Singin' In The Rain.La Depeche, July 6, 1982 These artists performed and also gave master classes on musical theater to lyricists, librettists, playwrights, composers, directors, and performers from all over the world. In Lower Manhattan The Bridge has presented Performance-Forums in which theater artists collaborate on productions with astrophysicists, philosophers, architects and others working in a variety of disciplines. Also, in Lower Manhattan, The Bridge produced Hart & Hammerstein Centennial Plus One which re-introduced Castle Clinton as a noteworthy performance space. Purpose The purpose of The Bridge is to further collaborative creation of new theatrical hybrids by spanning different disciplines, cultures and generations; and to provide educational programs in the performing and visual arts. Notable productions In the South of France, The Bridge presented Alan Jay Lerner and Liz Robertson In Concert, Honi Coles and The Copasetics In Concert, and Betty Comden and Adolph Green In Concert.\\"La Depeche 1982 July 6\\" In Lower Manhattan, The Bridge has produced its Performance-Forums with astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson, theater director, Tom O'Horgan and others. And in June 2001, it presented Hart & Hammerstein Centennial Plus One at Castle Clinton, near the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. The production was the first of a summer concert series, and marked the first time in 146 years that Castle Clinton had been used as a theater. Castle Clinton, a -year-old circular stone garrison built in 1811 to protect New York from the warring British, has served as an indoor garden, an opera house, an aquarium, an immigrant landing depot, and the setting in which the \\"Swedish Nightingale\\" Jenny Lind made her 1850 American debut, courtesy of P.T. Barnum; also, in recent years, as a ticket booth for ferries to the Statue of Liberty. Founder and artistic director Avra Petrides, a native New Yorker, is the daughter of pioneering woman orchestral conductor, Fr√©d√©rique Petrides, and journalist, Peter Petrides, who, for many years was managing editor of the New York City-based, Greek-American newspaper, The National Herald (not to be confused with the newspaper of the same name that was established in 1997).

It was then known as The Bridge American Theater Festival, Inc. In 1995, its title was changed to The Bridge Stage of the Arts, Inc.Certificate of Amendment, filed with the Secretary of State on June 2nd 1995 The Bridge works on a project by project basis. =Festival in south of France= Bridge Productions are always staged in spaces exceptional for their beauty and resonance of the past. Although based in Manhattan, in the 1980s, The Bridge produced summer music theater festivals in the south of France, with an emphasis on the American musical theater. Alan Jay Lerner (lyricist, librettist, My Fair Lady, Camelot), Comden and Green, lyricists- screenwriters Singin' In The Rain, Will Rogers Follies) tap dancer Honi Coles, (Tony Award winner, My One and Only), Virgil Thomson, (critic and composer, Four Saints in Three Acts), members of the American Dance Machine and of Joseph Chaikin's experimental The Open Theater, and others performed at night and taught master classes during the day. Each summer, through the invitation of The Bridge and the International Theatre Institute,\\"Theatre Notes,\\" International Theatre Institute USA, No. 107, May 1982 (a branch of UNESCO), 150 actors, singers, dancers, choreographers, playwrights, composers, directors and lyricists and librettists from, at times, 22 countries including France, China, Australia, Ethiopia, Madagascar, America and Japan came to partake free of charge in The Bridge programs. The performances attended by an international audience were sold out. Surrounded by sunlit vineyards and streams, the festivals' first site, in 1982, was a restored 17th century factory, in the small, medieval township of Saint-Chinian, South of France, (Languedoc-Roussillon region), where the uniforms of Louis XIV's regiments were once embroidered. In 1984, The Bridge Festival moved to the nearby walled medieval city of Beziers also in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of the South of France. To bring something as high spirited and new as the American musical into these timeless surroundings was thrilling, giving a sense of new in old, of continuity of tradition and the march of time.Variety, July 21, 1982French newspaper Midi Libre, July 2, 1982French publication L'information du Spectacle, June 1982French newspaper Midi Libre, June 25, 1982French newspaper La Depeche, June 19, 1982French newspaper La Marseillaise (fr) de l'Herault, July 1, 1982French newspaper Liberation July 2, 1982French newspaper La Marseillaise (fr) de l'Herault, June 25, 1982French newspaper Midi Libre, June 26, 1982French newspaper La Depeche, July 6, 1982French newspaper Le Monde, June 24, 1982French newspaper Le Figaro, June 11, 1982French newspaper Midi Libre, July 17, 1984French newspaper Midi Libre, July 20, 1984French newspaper Midi Libre, July 22, 1984French newspaper Midi Libre, July 26, 1984French newspaper Midi Libre, July 27, 1984French newspaper Midi Libre, July 28, 1984 Betty Comden review excerpted Betty Comden and her partner, Adolph Green, were prolific lyricists and librettists of Broadway and film musicals including Singin' In The Rain, Bells Are Ringing, and On the Town. Comden gave The Bridge kudos in 1985. = Performance-Forums = In 1996, in Lower Manhattan, The Bridge initiated its Performance- Forums in the Art Deco \\"Cocoa\\" building at No.1 Wall Street. In this series, American/international theater artists collaborate with astrophysicists, sculptors, theologians, philosophers, poets, novelists, painters, musicians, choreographers, filmmakers, and others working in a variety of creative, scientific and intellectual disciplines. The aim: to better understand each other's endeavors and find new and exciting ways to combine them in stage production. The theme of the initial Performance-Forum was Time (as perceived by people in different disciplines and cultures.) For several months prior to this event these people collaborated on a performance based on that theme: * Tom O'Horgan, Theater director of the Broadway productions Hair, Jesus Christ Superstar, Lenny, Inner City; director for the Vienna State Opera, New York City Opera; and co- author of Senator Joe at the Neil Simon Theater on Broadway. * Neil de Grasse Tyson, Ph.D. Astrophysicist and Director of the Hayden Planetarium. * Michael Sherman, A futurist, who was advising governments and corporations on their long-range plans. He has made a comparative study of images of time in modern culture. * Min Tanaka, International choreographer and Butoh dancer. * Tony Rothman, Ph.D. Physicist specializing in cosmology, who has been on the Editorial Board of Scientific American, and a Pulitzer Prize nominee. * Kirk Nurock, Composer/pianist, who has played with Phil Woods, Chet Baker, Dizzy Gillespie and Donald Byrd. His compositions and arrangements have been performed by Judy Collins, Dizzy Gillespie, Dick Hyman, Bette Midler, Jane Ira Bloom, The Brecker Brothers and Jay Clayton. * Serge Gubelman, who has been playing the Didgeridu since the 70's. * R.M. Fischer, Sculptor and installation artist, whose work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, The Cincinnati Art Museum, and the Dallas Museum of Art, among others. His public installations include Rector Gate at Battery Park City and the Kansas City Sky Stations. * Brenda Bufalino, Tap dancer and Founder of the American Tap Dance Foundation, who has performed as a soloist at Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall, the Smithsonian Institution, the Kennedy Center and on PBS' Great Performances series; and- * Theo Bleckmann, Vocalist and composer who has worked with Philip Glass, Anthony Braxton, Elliott Sharp, Meredith Monk and Kirk Nurock. This debut Performance-Forum, given on March 28, 1996, was attended by approximately two hundred artists, scientists and philosophers, who, at its conclusion, participated in the Forum, which took the form of a panel-led discussion on the evening's theme Time.The WQXR-FM initiative, Action for the Arts featured The Bridge Performance - Forums in public service announcements made by The Bridge's Artistic Director, Avra Petrides (on WQXR-FM) and they were featured in their Action for the Arts \\"catalog\\" which detailed the work of 96 organizationsarchival video tape of the entire event, held by The Bridge Stage of the Arts = Castle Clinton redux = In addition, in 1996, The Bridge re- introduced the beautiful 19th century reddish circular stone structure in Historic Battery Park, Castle Clinton, as a remarkable performance space, with the production, Hart and Hammerstein Centennial Plus One. An evening of song, it was hosted by CBS' Charles Osgood, and featured leading singers and Rob Fisher, then musical director of the Encores! series at the New York City Center. It was the first performance at Castle Clinton since the mid-1800s when, as an opera house, it was the Lincoln Center of its day, attracting impresarios like P.T. Barnum and performers like Jenny Lind. For the Hart & Hammerstein production, The Bridge brought in Broadway theater technicians who, by working into the wee hours of the night before the performance, erected a 30 inch high, spacious stage, and to guard against the possibility of rain bringing the performance to a close, covered the roof opening with a translucent white tent.\\"Castle Clinton ‚Ä¶ Rising in the East,\\" New York Magazine, June 3, 1996  Robert Moses and Castle Clinton  In 1941, the Parks Commissioner, Robert Moses, wanted to raze Castle Clinton, claiming it was essential to building the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel from the Battery to Brooklyn.

Although the term \\"organic wine bar\\" is becoming very popular, the term does not guarantee that the entire wine lists at these wine bars will be 100% organic. Main feature of the organic wine bar is a wide selection of wines available by the glass. Some organic wine bars prefer to focus on a certain region that produces and supports organic winemaking.  Basic definitions  = Organic wine = Tamburlaine Sauvignon Blanc,An Australian Organic Wine The most widely accepted definition of Organic wine is wine made from grapes grown in accordance with principles of organic farming, which typically excludes the use of artificial chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides and herbicides. Organic wine is generally consumed for its perceived health benefits and reduced environmental impact. The consumption of organic wine grew at a rate of 3.7 percent over the year ending September 19, 2009,The Nielsen Company out-pacing growth in the consumption of non-organic wine which grew 2%Mintel Market Research during a similar period. There are an estimated 1500-2000 organic wine producers globally,OrganicWineFind including negociant labels, with more than 885 of these organic domaines in France alone.http://www.organic-wine.bien-boire.info = Biodynamic wine = The practice of biodynamics in viticulture (grape growing) has become popular in recent years in several growing regions, including France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Germany, Australia, Chile, South Africa, Canada, and the United States. A number of very high-end, high- profile commercial growers have converted recently to biodynamic practices. Many of the top estates in France, including Domaine Leroy in Burgundy, Ch√¢teau de la Roche-aux-Moines in the Loire, Maison Chapoutier in the Rhone Valley, and Domaine Zind-Humbrecht in Alsace practice biodynamic viticulture. There are currently more than 450 biodynamic wine producers worldwide. For a wine label to state ‚Äúbiodynamic‚Äù, the winery has to meet the stringent standards laid down by the Demeter Association, which is an internationally recognized certifying body. Like biodynamic agriculture in general, biodynamic viticulture stems from the ideas and suggestions of Rudolf Steiner (1861‚Äì1925), who gave his now famous Agriculture Course in 1924, predating most of the organic movement. The principles and practices of biodynamics are based on his spiritual/practical philosophy, called anthroposophy, which includes understanding the ecological, the energetic, and the spiritual in nature. As a practical method of farming, biodynamics embodies the ideal of ever-increasing ecological self-sufficiency just as with modern agro-ecology, but includes ethical-spiritual considerations. This type of viticulture views the farm as a cohesive, interconnected living system. = Sustainable wines= Some farmers take additional steps beyond standard organic winemaking to apply sustainable farming practices. Examples include the use of composting and the cultivation of plants that attract insects that are beneficial to the health of the vines. Sustainable practices in these vineyards also extend to actions that have seemingly little or nothing to do with the production of grapes such as providing areas for wildlife to flourish near vineyard sites (this provides vegetation for the animals, which keeps them from eating the grapes) and allowing weeds and wildflowers to grow between the vines (this stresses the vines and forces them to produce fewer bunches of grapes with a greater concentration of flavor). Sustainable farmers are increasingly using bio- diesel for tractors in the vineyards (which reduces harmful emissions among the vines) or ploughing with horses. Another popular practice is to offset the carbon emissions of glass production and transportation through other offsets such as planting trees, or sponsoring other initiatives.

He does so and relates the story of his death at the hands of Hector, rebuking the excessive passion of his wife, who cannot bring herself to consent to his return to the shades of death. Summoned by Hermes the spectre departs, leaving Laodamia a lifeless corpse upon the palace floor. The poem closes with a description of the trees which grew from the tomb of each and withered at the top when they had attained such a height that they commanded a view of the walls of Troy. Interpretation The underlying idea of the poem is the weakness of the soul exemplified in Laodamia, whose uncontrolled love makes her incapable of lifting her heart to a \\"higher object\\" and accepting her husband's sacrifice and fate. Both the motive of the piece and its classical atmosphere reflect the change in point of view which Wordsworth experienced in his maturer years. (See \\"Ode to Duty\\".) Its beauty of style and calm nobility of tone make it one of Wordsworth's unquestionable masterpieces. The poem bears traces of the influence of Virgil, whom the poet was rereading at the time. Versions In an earlier version Laodamia is more pitied than condemned. Later the ethics of the poem seemed to require her punishment. The present ending, adopted in 1845, is a kind of compromise.

It was based in part on the British Official Secrets Act of 1889 and criminalized obtaining or delivering \\"information respecting the national defense, to which he is not lawfully entitled\\". Much of the language of the 1911 law was re-used in the Espionage Act of 1917, still in force.  History  Reuben Moon reported on the US House of Representatives version of the bill, HR 26656, in January 1911. His stated purpose for bringing the bill forward were several cases of Espionage that went unprosecuted because the United States, unlike other countries at the time, lacked any anti-Espionage law. He gave examples from the Panama Canal, the Philippines, and elsewhere, in which sketches or blueprints of military installations had been available to foreign parties, sometimes for money. He also cited recent wars, like the Russo-Japanese War, where he argued knowledge of the enemy had been decisive. The act was entitled \\"An Act to prevent the disclosure of national defense secrets\\". It was approved on March 3, 1911. At the time, the United States, under general John J. Pershing, and President William Howard Taft, was fighting the Moro Rebellion in the southern Philippines, a fallout from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 10 years earlier. The law specifically mentioned the Philippines. The language of the 1911 act, especially the notion of information 'relating' to the 'national defense' being obtained or delivered to 'those not entitled to receive it', was retained through subsequent American secrecy laws, including the Espionage Act of 1917 and the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950. Many later Espionage Act cases, for example Gorin v. United States, involved arguments about the exact meaning of terms like 'national defense'.  Brief history of US government secrecy  Ericson argues that historically the US government had been somewhat lax regarding secrecy. For example, Thomas Paine in 1777 published information from the Committee of Secret Correspondence about France's aid to the American revolutionary war effort; he was simply fired. Alexis de Tocqueville also commented on the casual nature in which he was given original documents into his permanent possession just by asking for them. The storage of documents was haphazard as well. President Jackson even proclaimed he did not care if his political enemies obtained his documents. However, there was a death penalty implemented for certain forms of spying during the Revolutionary War; for more information please see: Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War. The 1869 \\"General Orders no. 35\\" limited collection of information about fortifications, and this was expanded at the time of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the late 1890s. Edgar and Schmidt write that when the DSA was passed, the few state secrets laws that existed (35 Stat 1038 and 35 Stat 1097 (1909)) related to \\"treason, unlawful entry into military bases, and theft of government property\\".  Text of the law  As the laws have been revised, the original act has disappeared or been modified. Thus, the actual text of the act can only be obtained by looking at previous versions of the law.

Among its primary goals are creation and archiving of a fully Unicode- compatible Bengali literary corpus to be hosted and published online, as well as the creation of fonts that will help people type Bengali text with ease.  About SNLTR  English is still the primary medium of interaction with computers. Consequently, a large section of the population in India is not able to reap the benefits of the technology. Though the issue of localization of interface has been discussed in different forum, the goal is yet to be achieved. In spite of the fact that desktop publishing has come of age for Bengali and other Indian languages and there are several software available for Bengali, the problem persists due to the absence of i) standardization of Bengali encoding, ii) encoding compliant font design, iii) availability of compliant keyboard layouts etc. The lack of adherence to standard does not allow the computing activities in Indian languages to be inter-operable across computing platforms. In order to make the computing activities Bengali compatible, it is essential to establish a proper standard. Though a number of organizations have taken up language processing activities, the necessity of establishing proper coherence among them is very much felt, in order to deliver useful products. Language Technology research has to focus on two components, written text as well as spoken language .Besides text processing, speech generation and recognition are two very important areas in which research and development have to be focused. This development will not only result in more natural human-computer interfaces, but will also empower the physically challenged like those with speech impairment and visual impairment, to benefit from computer technology. The Society for Natural Language Technology Research has been formed to address the above-mentioned requirements. The society has been seeded by the Government of West Bengal (Dept. of Information Technology) with initial funding and support. Operationally, the society aims to carry out its activities in a multipolar manner, involving other academic and research institutes as well as industries. Data Representation and Encoding Standard: Society for Natural Language Technology Research has decided to accept UNICODE 5.0 and upwards as the standard for data representation and encoding for Bengali.  Mission and Goals  * To develop technology and standards to make computer usage Bengali enabled. * To spread out the benefits of language technology research to real life activities including official works, education, and literature through development of suitable applications. * To establish a collaborative environment of natural language processing related activities with educational and research organizations as well as with industries. The immediate goals of the society are: * To establish standards for Bengali text processing to ensure interoperability across platforms. * To develop large standardized corpus for Bengali text and speech. * To create an ensemble of available Bengali software and corpus in a standardized form and make them easily available to all. * To develop new software and modify or enhance the existing software. * To develop suitable speech Technology for Bengali. * To work towards similar development for other Eastern Indian Languages.

The protests were called by Mexican poet Javier Sicilia in response to the death of his son in Cuernavaca. The protesters have called for an end to the Drug War, the legalization of drugs, and the removal of Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n. Protests have occurred in over 40 Mexican cities, including an estimated 50,000 in Cuernavaca and 20,000 in Mexico City. The protests continued in Cuernavaca on 5 May, when over 600 marched against the Drug War. The movement headed by Javier Sicilia may have had a role in the rejection in 2011 of a reform to the National Security Act that would have granted more attributions related to public security to the Mexican Armed Forces.  Events  = May 2011 protests = Following Javier Sicilia's sons death on 28 March, and open letter \\"To Mexico's Politicians and Criminals\\" a silent protest took place in Z√≥calo, Mexico City on 8 May. The protest began in Cuernavaca, Morelos where more than 200,000 protesters walked 100 km to Mexico City. Some protesters were covered in blood, while others carried pictures of their dead family members. The slogans in these protests include \\"Estamos hasta la madre!\\" (\\"We've had it!\\") and \\"No m√°s sangre\\" (\\"No more blood\\"). = September 5, 2011 = On September 5, 2011, President Felipe Calderon gave the fifth state of the nation address since his contested election in 2006. More than 50,000 people attended a demonstration to the Z√≥calo main square in Mexico City. More than half the square has been occupied since May 2011. = The 15 October Movement = Demonstrations occurred throughout Mexico as part of the 15 October 2011 global protests. Hundreds of people marched at the Monument to the Revolution at one of the smaller protests of the day. This protest was connected to the world Occupy Movement, which although centres around the world financial imbalance, carries multiple causes. The protest held in Mexico contained signs that read; No blood or STOP the war on drugs. = Meeting with Cabinet = The organizers of the main protests, also known as the Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity were able to voice their concerns to the Federal Cabinet in June 2011. In response to the protests anti-military concerns Calderon explained \\"Violence does not occur in a particular place because the Federal Forces are there. The opposite is true: the Federal Forces are there because that is where there is violence. It is the violence of criminals that kill and abduct rather than the state's response to combat them that has caused this situation.\\"  Goals  The main goals of these protests are to 'pull the army off the streets', decrease the death number specifically of innocent bystanders by ensuring the safety of citizens. The protesters are not in favour of President Calderon's drug-cartel dismantling policies, namely his national security strategy creating 'militarization of the war on drugs', where cities became reminiscent of battle grounds between battling cartel and government militia. = Controversies = Despite the many deaths of political figures, the protesters brought to light the heavy civilian death toll, carrying pictures of loved ones who have been killed in the country's drug related violence. The numbers are not concrete due to lack of police records and discrepancy but estimates but the number to the tens of thousands. This discrepancy points to police corruption as authorities are being accused of \\"under-reporting the number of deaths or deliberately changing the details of those killed to make it appear that the victims are criminals rather than civilians\\". Additionally, Calderon's National Security Strategy was heavily debated as it sanctions 'warrantless searches, the detention of suspects without charges; the collection of intelligence and counterintelligence \\"using any method; and electronic surveillance of citizens\\". = National Pact = A Nation Pact, signed 14 June was a collaborate effort to set out an outline for the civilians demands. These demands follow the outline of the goals of the protests and include ' giving more visibility to the victims of violence and their families, ending the administration's \\"militarized approach\\" to combating crime, punishing corruption and impunity, working to address the social and economic causes of organized crime.'Can Mexico's Peace Movement Change Calderon's Strategy?  International impact  The influence and growth of these protests have led to smaller demonstrations held in cities all over the world. Cities with Mexican sub-communities such as Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Montreal, The Hague, and Frankfurt have held their own protests in support of crisis in Mexican cities. Protests were also coordinated in Washington, D.C., as U.S. policy supports and supplies Calderon's policies.
