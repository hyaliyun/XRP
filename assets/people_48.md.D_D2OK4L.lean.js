The Clarks stepped as Co-Directors of La Selva in 1994 to conduct full-time research on tropical forest structure, life histories of tropical trees, and the effects of climate change. With funding from numerous source they implemented a 42 meter tower to measure atmospheric carbon as part a global array dedicated to studying climate change.

The programs run by the Story Factory aim to help young people, particularly those most at risk of losing confidence and then losing interest in schooling. The Story Factory conducts programs at its two creative writing centres, as short and long term residencies at primary and secondary schools, and as one-off visits. The Story Factory began in 2012 as the Sydney Story Factory in Redfern, in inner city Sydney. The organisation changed its name to the Story Factory at the opening of their second site in Paramatta to the west of Sydney in October 2018. Paramatta Creative Writing Centre  History  In 2010 the co-founders of the Story Factory, Catherine Keenan AM and Tim Dick, heard Dave Eggers give a TED talk about 826 Valencia and they were inspired to set up something similar in Sydney. They flew to San Francisco and visited 826 Valencia to learn as much as they could about its model. Unlike 826 Valencia, The Story Factory does not provide homework help, but focuses on creative writing. As a not-for-profit organisation that relies on volunteers and donations for support it took approximately 18 months to get the first site of The Story Factory operational. The initial volunteers' meeting drew a crowd of 200 people. Since it opened in 2012, approximately 16,000 students have participated in the programs. In 2018 they had 1050 active volunteer writing tutors and see approximately 800 children per week.  Philosophy and operation  The Story Factory focuses on creative writing rather than the homework help provided in the original 826 Valencia program. This philosophy is based on discussion with local teachers who said that there is much less space for creativity in the Australian curriculum now. The University of Sydney conducted an evaluation of the student involvement in the Story Factory from 2014 to 2016. The study looked at the development of writing skills, self-confidence, engagement in learning, and enthusiasm for creative writing. The study used case study methodology and also pre- and post-program surveys. A total of 88 students were surveyed and from these 10 were the subject of detailed case studies. The evaluation showed that students felt positive about the program and believed it helped with school work. It showed the students gained empowerment and grew in self-knowledge and self-awareness. Students who participated in several workshops grew their creative writing skills often to a higher level than would be expected of their grade or stage. An evaluation of the in-schools residency programs run by the Story Factory found a \\"notable shift in writing confidence and enjoyment\\" in all five schools involved and this was particularly strong among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants. Former board member of The Story Factory, Professor Robyn Ewing, stated that \\"education is possibly the most critical factor in alleviating disadvantage, and the Story Factory strives to change the lives of young people, especially those from marginalised backgrounds, through creative writing and storytelling.\\" The Story Factory is supported by a variety of people. This includes three former Australian Prime Ministers: Julia Gillard and Tony Abbot who appeared is a video for the Story Factory in 2011 and Malcolm Turnbull through the Turnbull Foundation. It has also conducted four art auctions in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017 The auctions have received donations from six Archibald Prize winners: Kathryn Del Barton, Fiona Lowry, Nigel Milsom, Mitch Cairns, Euan Macleod and Wendy Sharpe. In 2017 the auction also included 2016 Archilbald Prize finalist, Abdul Abdullah, and another 45 artists. = Leadership = Catherine Keenan is the co-founder and Executive Director of the Sydney Story Factory. In 2016 she was recognised as Australian of The Year, Local Hero for her work with the Story Factory. Keenan was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2019 for \\"significant service to children as an advocate for improving literacy, and to the community of Redfern.\\" The Story Factory has a Director and Storyteller-in-Chief at each location. Richard Short, Storyteller-in Chief at Redfern, has led workshops for teachers to improve their understanding of the creative process and also to teach them the vocabulary used at The Story Factory. Bilal Hafda, Storyteller-in-Chief at Parramatta, won a $10,000 grant when he became the Westfield Local Hero in 2018. \\"The Story Factory will use its $10,000 Westfield Local Heroes grant to fund two eight-week creative writing programs for as many as 60 participants. This includes payment of the workshop leader, volunteer tutor training, workshop materials and publishing of the student stories.\\" = Story Spaces = Redfern  Martian Embassy, Redfern The Story Factory first opened in Redfern in 2012. The Story Factory is accessed through the Martian Embassy, this design was awarded the 2013 NSW Premiers prize by the Australian Institute of Architects. The idea is a spinoff from 826 Valencia that has a Pirate Supply Shop as its front. Keenan stated that the kids and the volunteers loved the design and the staff liked the idea of going to another world. The Martian Embassy is the retail arm of the Story Factory. The shop then opens into the creative space.  Paramatta  Paramatta Story Factory In 2016 more than 25% of the students attending the Redfern creative space travelled from Western Sydney. Western Sydney has the largest indigenous population is the country and many new immigrants. With the assistance of a grant from the Commonwealth Government and other donations, the Parramatta location opened in October 2018. The building at 88-92 George Street is heritage listed. Refurbishing to make it a suitable workshop space involved consideration of heritage requirements. The space was shortlisted for 2019 public design by the Australian Interior Design Awards = School Residency Programs = The Story Factory runs year long residency programs with local schools, at both Primary and Secondary levels. The first residency program lasted for a full school term at the Briar Road Public School in Campbelltown. In 2017 Canterbury Boys High was given a 12-month Story Factory residency program. The program was recognised in the 2018 NSW Department of Education Minister's and Secretary's Award for Excellence when Canterbury Boys High as awarded the 2018 Secretary's Award for Outstanding School Initiative. = Novella Program = In 2016 The Story Factory initiated a pilot Novella Program and selected children aged between 12 and 16 to write a novella of between 20,000 and 30,000 words. The works were published by The Story Factory in December 2016. The program is continuing. The 2016 and 2017 novellas were published by the Story Factory. One of the 2017 novellas, Coconut Children by Vivian Pham, has been expanded and published by Penguin Random House.

The screenplay by Tawni O'Dell and Adrian Lyne was adapted from the best selling novel of the same name by Tawni O'Dell. Starring Alex Pettyfer, Jennifer Morrison, Nicola Peltz, Robert Patrick and Juliette Lewis, the film centers on a young man stuck in the Pennsylvania backwoods caring for his three younger sisters after his mother is arrested for murdering his father. It premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival and was released in selected theaters in the United States on December 7, 2018, by Samuel Goldwyn Films, and will also be released on video on demand and digital. Plot After his mother (Juliette Lewis) is imprisoned for killing his abusive father, Harley Altmyer (Alex Pettyfer) is left to care for his three younger sisters in rural Pennsylvania. Harley forgoes his college education, working dead-end jobs to pay the bills and raise his siblings, including his rebellious, promiscuous and sexually-maniacally-abusive 16-year-old sister, Amber (Nicola Peltz). Scarred by his past, Harley becomes infatuated with Callie Mercer (Jennifer Morrison), the older married woman who lives nearby. Things take a dangerous turn when they embark on an affair and shocking family secrets soon begin to emerge. As Harley's life spirals out of control, unspoken truths leading to a devastating conclusion come to the surface and threaten to consume him.

He also plays the lead character of Harley, in a cast that includes Jennifer Morrison, Nicola Peltz, Chiara Aurelia, Hala Finley, June Carryl, with Robert Patrick and Juliette Lewis. The project has long compelled Pettyfer‚Äôs interest. Nearly a decade ago, when the film was originally announced as an Adrian Lyne production, the actor auditioned for the role of Harley. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, it didn‚Äôt work out,‚Äù says Pettyfer, who was 18 or 19 at the time. But Pettyfer never lost hope for the movie. As his professional ambitions evolved, the possibility of making it a reality emerged with the formation of Upturn Productions, LLC. ‚ÄúPettyfer and his producing partner Craig Robinson setup Upturn Productions in 2015 with the intent of securing literary works that could be made into film or television. Their first project secured was based on the life of Colombian drug lord, Griselda Blanco, which they developed with LBI Entertainment‚Äôs Julie Yorn and Patrick Walmsley, and secured a co-production with Jennifer Lopez and her producing partner Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas at Nuyorican Productions. The feature film project was picked up by HBO with Terence Winter attached to write and executive produce with Jennifer Lopez. Upturn went on to secure its next co-production with producer Michael Ohoven (The Human Stain, The Final Cut, Push, and Capote), who had controlled the rights to Back Roads for over ten years. After numerous attempts to secure a top tier director for the film in 2016, with Pettyfer as the lead, Robinson went back to his financiers of the film and convinced them to give Pettyfer an opportunity to direct Back Roads as his first film. Pettyfer and Robinson hadn‚Äôt taken on the project with the expectation of Pettyfer directing, it was more to control the content Upturn wanted to produce with Pettyfer as a lead. ‚ÄúI always approached it as an actor,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAs an actor, it‚Äôs a rich piece of material. Never in my right mind would I ever think that I would get the opportunity to direct a film, ever. So, really, me coming back to it, I knew it was an important piece of material to talk about, and we as actors are always looking for a challenge, so to me I was coming back to get the project made.‚Äù Every producer knows the challenge of pulling together funds for an independent feature film, let alone funding a film for a first-time director who is also self-directing in a starring role. Yet, Robinson secured Pettyfer‚Äôs directorial foothold on several grounds. Firstly, the financiers were willing to agree to the condition of reducing their risk and budget, which equated to a limited twenty-three day shooting schedule. Secondly, they stipulated that Pettyfer would be bolstered in his endeavor by a support network of Upturn and Infinity‚Äôs team of professionals, including producer Michael Ohoven and writer/producer Ashley Mansour. = Filming = Working with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke (I Believe in Unicorns, The Witch), Pettyfer made use of locations in the southern Louisiana town of St. Francisville to stand in for a rural Pennsylvania that feels like a closed-off shadow world. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know the era or where you are,‚Äù Pettyfer says. ‚ÄúI kind of set it in the early ‚Äò90s.‚Äù Only one clock is witnessed, and no cell phones. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only a pay phone, and you begin feeling more and more closed in. In the beginning, there are opening shots of landscape, but then it becomes darker and more confined.‚Äù Given the story‚Äôs lurid undertow, Pettyfer was mindful of overplaying the material, encouraging the film‚Äôs audience to key in on its psychological complexity and feel compassion for characters whose inner and outer lives have been twisted up by tragic circumstances dangerously larger than themselves. ‚ÄúThe key behind the film I wanted to make was a much more subtle film and that was my take from the beginning,‚Äù Pettyfer says. ‚ÄúI wanted it to be an exploration of emotion and an exploration of family drama, rather than an exploration into this kind of sexual dark romance. If Adrian Lyne had made the film, he would have made a completely different film. Not necessarily better or worse, just a different film. I could have gone down that avenue but I wanted to create something different.‚Äù  Release  The film premiered at Tribeca on April 20, 2018. On August 16, 2018, Samuel Goldwyn Films acquired distribution rights to the film for North America. The film will be released on December 7, 2018 in selected theaters in the United States, video on demand and digital, by Samuel Goldwyn Films. = Critical reception = Back Roads received mixed reviews from critics. , 55% of the 29 reviews compiled on Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with an average rating of 5.61/10.

Family and education Sargent was famously reticent about her personal history, and little is known about her early life apart from the fact that she was born Jesse Irene Sargent in Auburn, New York. She was the fourth daughter of Rufus Sargent, a machine designer and tool manufacturer, and Phebe Sargent. There is no record of any formal education, but she apparently traveled in Europe after her father's death in 1882 to further her studies. In 1922, Syracuse University awarded her an honorary doctorate (D. Litt.). Career Sargent taught at Syracuse University for nearly four decades (1895‚Äì1932). She began as an instructor of French, moved on to be an instructor of Italian, and subsequently taught a range of courses in aesthetics, architecture, and art history. She became a professor of art history in 1908 and of Italian literature as well in 1914. Over the course of her career, she wrote over 150 articles and one book, Household Furniture: Its Origin from the Bed and the Chest (1926). Sargent was a key figure in the founding and early years of The Craftsman, a leading American Arts and Crafts magazine published by Gustav Stickley. She wrote nearly all of its first three issues herself and thereafter usually wrote each issue's lead article as well as acting as its managing editor and designing its layouts. Her writing in The Craftsman did a great deal to shape public understanding of the American Arts and Crafts aesthetic and contributed enormously to the magazine's success. Her articles are still considered important original scholarship of great value to scholars of early 20th century American arts. She wrote on such subjects as John Ruskin, William Morris, the Gothic Revival, textile design, medieval silversmiths, and American art pottery. Sargent wrote over 80 articles for The Craftsman between 1901 and 1905, stopping not long after Stickley moved the magazine to New York City. She began contributing instead to The Keystone, a jewelers' trade journal. From 1905 to 1920, she wrote more than five dozen articles on a wide range of applied arts for The Keystone. She chose this trade publication as the outlet for her scholarship because at the time American art journals were not receptive to scholarly research on the decorative arts. She also contributed to Keramic Studio, a ceramics magazine published by her Syracuse University colleague Adela√Øde Alsop Robineau. Sargent contributed articles on fine arts to two encyclopedias, A Cyclopaedia of Education and the Lincoln Library of Essential Information. She was also in demand as a public speaker. In 1926, the American Institute of Architects awarded her an honorary membership in recognition of her contributions to scholarship in architecture and related fields, only the second woman in AIA history to receive this honor. In the summer of 1932, a fall led to her death at the age of 80. She is buried in Oakwood Cemetery. Her papers are held by Syracuse University. ReferencesFurther reading * Reed, Cleota.

Biography Panoramic view of the city of Ghent He was born in Ghent into an art-loving family, the son of draughtsman Charles Den Duyts. His grandfather Frans Den Duyts was appointed in 1824 as Custodian of Collections of the (newly founded) Ghent University and in 1832 as Custodian of the Collection of Commemorative Medals and Antiquities of the University. Although his artistic talent was evident from a small age he had no lessons and was largely self-taught. Initially opting for a career in industry he decided at the age of 25 to become an artist. He set up in a small studio in the centre of Ghent with artist Jean Delvin, later the director of the Ghent Academy of Fine Arts, which he occupied until his death in 1897. In 1874 he took part in the Triennial Art Salon of Ghent for the first time. His graphic work quickly gained attention. His etchings Hoeve in Vlaanderen (Farm in Flanders) and Boerenstulp te Groenendael won him a prize in 1875 in the competition run by the journal \\"Journal des Beaux-Arts\\". On the other hand, at the Fifth Exhibition of the Vereniging der Gentsche Kunstoefenaren, where he exhibited together with Jean Delvin, his painting received criticism because of being too modern. Its indefinite forms forced the viewer to squint in order to make it out and this vagueness of definition is now regarded as a forerunner of Flemish impressionism. Until 1880 Den Duyts continued his studies in the Art Society and Cercle Artistique in Ghent, where he maintained close contact with Jean Delvin and Armand Heins. Together they would become the main members of Ghent's art life in the 1870s. In 1877 he won a medal at the Paris Salon and in 1881 the Ghent Museum of Fine Arts acquired his Panoramic view of the city of Ghent MSK. In 1883, Den Duyts contracted pneumonia, which would degenerate into a chronic lung disease until his death. Because he began to feel misunderstood in Ghent, he left in 1887 to settle in Brussels. He nevertheless exhibited at the Triennial Salons of Ghent in both 1892 and 1895. In 1892 he was awarded the honorary diploma of the Dresden Art Society after an international exhibition of watercolors, etchings, pastels and drawings. He died in Brussels in 1897. He had married in 1895 and his daughter was born after his death. Work Much of his work was townscapes or landscapes with a melancholic feeling, often with a setting sun or a rising moon and typically done in autumn or winter. The landscapes are usually bare, skeletal and stylized, betraying the fact that he was a skilled etcher, but never detailed. Human or animal figures are not sharply defined but appear to dissolve into the background. As a result of his illness, from 1889 he did more work in the studio, such as portraits and still life.

The shrine is dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane, a 9th-century Japanese scholar.  Description  The Kameido shine was built in honor of Sugawara no Michizane, a prominent Japanese politician and scholar. Despite a long and successful career serving multiple Japanese emperors, Michizane was eventually demoted from his position in the imperial court by the political machinations of Fujiwara no Tokihira. Upon Michizane's death several years later, a series of natural disasters struck Japan; some attributed these events to the ghost of Michizane. To placate the departed scholar's spirit, a number of shrines were built (including one in Kyoto, then the imperial capital) in his honor, with many shrines portraying Michizane as a kami; even after the disasters subsided, this tradition of honoring Michizane's skill continued and many more shrines were built in his name.Morris, I. (1975). The Nobility of Failure: Tragic Heroes in the History of Japan On of the shrine's drum bridges in 1914 Wisteria floribunda The Kameido Tenjin Shrine was built in Tokyo in 1646. Tokyo was at time a port city of some importance, but was not yet the capital of Japan. Regardless, many people from Tokyo paid homage to Michizane at the shrine between 1646 and 1945. The original Kameido shrine, built out of wood, was destroyed during World War II when the United States Air Force conducted a firebombing campaign against Tokyo; these bombings resulted in the destruction of large parts of the city. In the years after the war, the shrine was rebuilt with more modern materials, such as concrete. The restored shrine is famous for a number of its prominent features; the shrine's grounds contain a number of ponds bridged by drum bridges, and compound also has an abundance of plum trees. Every year on 25 January, the custodians of the shire present a carved good luck charm to a visitor. Between April and May, the Fuji Matsuri festival is held at the shrine. The festival entails the celebration of flowers, namely the-then in bloom Wisteria.

Von Hagen; 1918  November 6, 2000) was an American jazz singer born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1918. Although she recorded little, Bari performed in clubs for sixty years. Early years Gwen Bari was born Ruth L. Von Hagen in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1918, to Frederick Von Hagen and Estella M. Von Hagen. With sister Estella Marie, she lived with her mother at her grandfather Samuel Rinehart's house in Chester, Delaware Co. Frederick died in 1927. Ruth's mother was a member of the Chester School Board. She learned violin at age 5 and piano at age 7 (her mother Estelle was a piano teacher). Voice training followed at Temple University under Henry Gurney, and she sang locally with the Chester Symphony Orchestra, the First Baptist Church Choir, and the Bala-Cynwyd Women's Club. After graduating from Chester High School in 1934, she received a scholarship to the Juilliard School in New York City and studied under Paul Reimers. In 1938 she performed in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania near her hometown of Chester, where she sang Wilson's Carmena and the Jewel Aria from Gounod's Faust at the Annual New Year's Players Club Reception Concert with the Swarthmore Symphony Orchestra. While studying opera at Juilliard in New York, and modeling bathing suits and stockings to support herself, an opportunity came up to sing at an Italian restaurant. Discovering her preference for the night-life as opposed to opera, Bari went on to play piano and sing in a variety of hotel clubs and lounges: the Glass Hat Room (Belmont Plaza Hotel), Manhattan Room (Hotel New Yorker), Hotel Fifth Avenue, e.g. - under the name of Gwen Gary. Performance and recordings In 1941, performing in Palm Springs, Florida, she met violinist Gene Bari; they married that same year and began to perform professionally as Gene and Gwen Bari. The couple stopped performing for 4 years while Gene, pursuant to his draft, completed military training. Upon her return to show business, Bari spent the decade of 1945-1955 playing clubs and lounges across the US. During 1956 and 1957 she made appearances in Europe and Asia as part of a Hollywood celebrity friendship tour abroad, including a command performance for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in Formosa. Bari's legacy as a live lounge entertainer from 1936 to 1997 ‚Äì inspired by Hildegarde - exceeds her recorded output. While articles (her hometown Chester Times, e.g.) extolled her original song writing capabilities, 10,000 tune live repertoire, radio and TV appearances, and 10 albums in the 1950s., 2 LP albums exist to her credit from 1951 and 1958; there is mention of a proposed 1963 LP that never materialized. The Gwen Bari Trio has a single musical vocal credit in 1951 with Tex Beneke's Orchestra on a tune called \\"The Yodel Waltz.\\" From the 1930s to the 1990s Bari performed in night clubs across the US, South America, Europe, China, Japan, Indonesia and Indo-China, and in multiple languages. From the 1950s, her act included a poodle costumed and with props like miniature pianos and candelabras. Bari's obituary states that, among other things, she worked in Hollywood in the 1950s dubbing songs for Warner Bros., Paramount, Fox and MGM studios. A short 1951 Telescriptions film is referenced (MP1428) of a performance of Lanny Ross with the Gwen Bari Singers. Bari ultimately settled in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where she performed in clubs such as Pier 66, The Moonraker, the Diplomat in Hollywood and the Eden Roc in Miami Beach. She co-founded the Broward Musicians Association and was the accompanist and arranger for the Broward Women's Chorus for nine years before opening Those Were the Days, a Lighthouse Point dinner club, in 1997. Personal life In early performances Ruth adopted the pseudonym Gwen Gary, and became Gwen Bari after her marriage to Gene Bari in 1941; they divorced in 1955 and had no children. In 1998 Bari suffered a stroke that left her paralyzed on her right side and with little ability to speak. She died on Nov. 6, 2000 at Palm Courts nursing home in Wilton Manors. Her husband at the time of her death was Jerry Darlington.

The 57.1 kilometre-long line was opened between 1855 and 1856 in four stages by the St. Gallen-Appenzell Railway (Sankt Gallisch- Appenzellische Eisenbahn, SGAE).  History= Construction and opening= Original Sitter Viaduct with a lattice girder. The bridges over the Glatt, the Uze and the Thur were built according to the same design principles. The Canton of Thurgau initially refused to grant a concession for the line on its territory, as the route would not have favoured Thurgau. The Swiss Northeastern Railway (Die Schweizerische Nordostbahn) operated the competing Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn railway through the Thurgau. The Winterthur‚ÄìWil‚ÄìThur bridge section at Schwarzenbach was built by Julius Herz. The Winterthur‚ÄìWil section was opened on 14 October 1855. The journey time was 40 minutes. The line between Wil and Flawil was hotly debated. The SGAE applied for a concession for the easily-built route south of Uzwil‚Äôs local hill, the Vogelsberg, from Schwarzenbach via the Bettenauer Weiher and Oberuzwil to Flawil. Commercial interests preferred a route north of the Vogelsberg so that Uzwil could have a station. So the line was built with a tight S-curve on the edge of the Vogelsberg, where Uzwil station was later built. As a result, this S-curve is today one of the slowest sections of the whole line and the tightest curve on a relatively high-speed line in Switzerland. The Wil‚ÄìFlawil section was opened on 25 December 1855. After the construction of the Glatt bridge at Egg between Flawil and Gossau was completed on 15 February 1856, the line reached Gossau and Winkeln. Finally, the line was extended to the town of St. Gallen on 24 March 1856. For this purpose, an iron lattice bridge designed by Karl Etzel was built over the Sitter, the original Sitter Viaduct. = Further development = Commencement of electric operations in 1927 with an Ae 3/6 I locomotive in Flawil A train coming from Winterthur derailed in Vonwil near St. Gallen on 31 December 1879. The two locomotives came to lie on the left and right of the railway track and the carriages were pushed into each other. The accident caused two deaths and several were injured, some seriously. The route became part of the Swiss Federal Railways on 1 July 1902 when the national railways were nationalised. Starting in 1903, the SBB duplicated the line in stages and electrified it in 1927 at 15,000 Volt 16 ‚Öî Hz. At the same time, the Algetshausen-Henau halt was opened and the B√ºhler industrial railway in Uzwil was handed over to the company. The Winterthur Hegi halt was opened in December 2006 as part of the expansion of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn. Algetshausen-Henau and Schwarzenbach stations were closed in 2013.  Operations In long-distance traffic, the line is part of the West-East axis from St. Gallen to Geneva. In regional traffic, the Rheintal-Express (REX) runs from Chur via St. Gallen to Wil. In local traffic, the line is served by line S 1 (St. Gallen‚ÄìWil), with additional services in the peak as line S 11 (St. Gallen‚ÄìWil), and line S 5 (St. Gallen‚ÄìGossau‚ÄìWeinfelden) of the St. Gallen S-Bahn.

He was a member of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, the son of SAMCRO co-founder Piney, a member of SAMCRO, and best friend of Jax since childhood. Character biography Opie's mother took him away from Piney and Charming when he was sixteen, but he left her and returned to his father and the club. =Season 1= While married to Donna, Opie is sent to prison for five years, after being caught by police when his getaway driver (Kyle Hobart) abandons him at a crime scene, thus leaving Opie's wife and two children, Ellie and Kenny, to fend for themselves during his incarceration. Upon his release, Opie's family has difficulty making ends meet, which contributes to Opie's decision to resume illegal activity with SAMCRO, against Donna's wishes. Agent June Stahl attempts to recruit Opie which causes her to trick Clay Morrow, SAMCRO's President, into believing that Opie had betrayed the Club and the others with whom he murdered Hefferen, a port commissioner. Clay responded by ordering Tig Trager to kill Opie and pin it on the One-Niners street gang. Opie's wife, Donna who was driving his truck, is mistakenly killed instead. =Season 2= After Donna is murdered, Opie spirals into depression. He starts to become more distant from his children, by crashing at the Club house where he bonds with Lyla, a porn star. They later form a relationship together, and Opie wants her to leave the porn industry. =Season 3= When the club starts exploiting its porn connections to entertain Henry Lin's clients, a furious Opie starts a fight with Lin's clients. This ultimately leads to the club losing out on a major deal. He travels to Belfast, Northern Ireland to aide Jax, who's searching for his missing son Abel. After Agent Stahl tries to screw SAMCRO, Opie, with the help of Unser, targets Agent Stahl in retribution for her role in the death of his wife, Donna. During this confrontation Stahl breaks down crying and begs Opie for her life, to which Opie responds, \\"This is what she felt.\\" He then shoots Stahl in the back of the head with a MAC-10, instantly killing her. After this, Chibs Telford rigs the scene to look as if the Real IRA murdered Stahl and Jimmy O'Phelan. =Season 4= Members of SAMCRO are released from prison after serving 14 months for federal weapons charges, due to Stahl's actions. They return to their hometown of Charming, California where they are disturbed by the sight of signs for a new real estate development in their quiet town, spearheaded by the town's new mayor Jacob Hale, Jr. and Elliott Oswald, whose land was seized for the project under eminent domain. On their way into town, they encounter the town's new sheriff, Eli Roosevelt, who together with Assistant U.S. Attorney Lincoln Potter has convened a secret task force to shut down the club's gunrunning operation. Opie and fianc√©e Lyla get married in a ceremony on an Indian reservation. During the wedding, Jax and Clay kill Russian mob boss Viktor Putlova, while other members seize the Russian's guns and use them to wipe out the rest of the mob. Opie discovers birth control in Lyla's dressing room. Angry that she is sabotaging their attempts to conceive, he sleeps with Ima. Lyla arrives at the clubhouse to find Ima leaving Opie's room. Opie says that he did it because he found her birth control pills, and when she admits to having an abortion, he tells her that he is leaving her until she decides what she wants. Jax lures Ima into her dressing room and throws her against a table, warning her to stay away from his family and the clubhouse. As the gang votes on the future of Clay's presidency, the clubhouse is attacked by the Lobos Sonora cartel, who drop off the severed heads of two SAMTAZ members, including club president Armando's. One cartel member is captured in the attack, but the Mayans are hit simultaneously, losing three men and a truck full of drugs. Piney demands that Clay withdraw the club from the drug business, threatening to deliver John Teller's letters to the club if he fails. Later that night, Clay arrives at Piney's house and kills him, scrawling the signature of the Lobos Sonora cartel on an old photo of the Sons of Anarchy's founding 'First 9.' Tig, and Opie turn to Lyla for help locating Georgie Caruso to punish him for inadvertently helping Hale. As they stuff him in the trunk of a car, he admits to sending men after Luann, but only with the intention of roughing her up. Tig and Opie fill his car with bullets. Opie takes the tow truck up to Piney's cabin and finds his father dead. Unser follows him to the cabin and tells him that Clay is the man responsible. Opie's trust in Jax and the club is broken as he seeks revenge. He later arrives at the club and shoots Clay twice. In an attempt to stop Opie, Jax shoots him in the wrist, and takes him to his home, where he stays hidden. =Season 5= Opie rebuffs Jax's offer to sit at the table due to Jax's decision in keeping Clay at the table. Clay visits Opie and convinces him that Jax needs him at the MC. Opie arrives at the clubhouse just as Jax, Tig Trager and Chibs Telford are being arrested for murder. Opie punches the sheriff to ensure he is kept close to Jax. Following a meeting with Damon Pope, Jax has to decide which member of the MC will die in prison. As he is about to sacrifice himself, Opie headbutts the prison guard and is taken to fight to the death. Despite initially putting up a good fight, Opie is outnumbered and eventually overpowered and beaten to death by a prison gang while Jax and Chibs watch on through a window. Jax vows to get revenge against the prison guard for the death of his friend. Opie's wake is held at the clubhouse with every member of SAMCRO in attendance. Development and reception Ryan Hurst portrays Opie Winston Ryan Hurst portrays Opie on Sons of Anarchy. Hurst was promoted to main star billing status starting in season two. Hurst's portrayal of Opie was met with positive reviews. Opie is killed off in the fifth season episode \\"Laying Pipe\\".

Selva and produced by Kamal Haasan. The film stars Vikram in the lead role and Akshara Haasan and Abi Hassan in supporting roles. It was shot between September 2018 and January 2019, and released on 19 July 2019, along with its Telugu-dubbed version Mr. KK. It is an official remake of the 2010 French film Point Blank.  Plot  The notorious criminal KK (Vikram) barely escapes from the Petronas Towers after a botched robbery, but gets injured in a car accident and goes into a coma for few months. Several months later, Vasu (Abi Hassan), a doctor, and his pregnant wife Aatirah (Akshara Haasan) begin their life in Kuala Lumpur. Vasu saves KK's life after a murder attempt but is reprimanded by his strict supervisor. After he comes back from work, an assailant knocks him out and kidnaps his wife. KK's brother holds her hostage and forces Vasu to smuggle KK out of the hospital, which is under heavy police guard as they seek to find KK's identity. Vasu and KK's brother attempt to meet at KL Sentral, but have to leave after the rival gang who previously pursued KK shows up. Two teams of rival cops, one by-the-book and another who rely more on extrajudicial methods but are praised for their results, compete to find the duo first. As cops are on the hunt for KK and Vasu, they realize there are moles within the department as well, and now it's up to KK and Vasu to escape from the threats and rescue Aatirah.  Cast  * Vikram as KK, a criminal who previously used several pseudonyms * Akshara Haasan as Aatirah * Abi Hassan as Vasu Rajagopalan * Lena as Kalpana Rengaswamy * Vikas Shrivastav as Vincent Rajadurai * Puravalan as Navin * Ravindra Vijay as Umar Ahamed * Cherry Mardia as Catherine Williams * Rajesh Kumar as Amaldas David, Chief of Police * Jasmine Kaur as Annie Jayanathan * Siddhartha Shankar as Nandha * Jawaharlal as Anad Makaio * Mukund as a duty doctor * Sandeep as an assassin * Senthil as an assassin * Padmini as Kumutha * Baby Dhanyashree as Aatirah and Vasu's daughter * Preetha as a gynecologist  Production  Film producer Chandrahasan initially wanted to make a film under his banner Raaj Kamal Films International with his brother Kamal Haasan starring and Rajesh Selva directing. Selva got this offer immediately after the release of his Thoongaa Vanam, which also starred Kamal. But Kamal became busy in his political career, so Selva instead approached Vikram who agreed to act in the still-untitled film after being impressed with the story Selva narrated to him. Chandrahasan later died, therefore he could not produce the project. On 30 August 2018, Kamal officially announced the still-untitled film which he would produce with Selva directing, while Vikram, Akshara Haasan, and Abi Hassan would star. Srinivas R. Gutha was announced as the cinematographer, while Praveen K. L. joined as editor. The film, which was co-produced by R. Ravindran of Trident Arts, began filming on the same day. The film's title Kadaram Kondan and first look poster were revealed on 6 November, the eve of Kamal's birthday. The film was shot in Kuala Lumpur for a month, where the shooting schedule ended in late November. Principal photography ended on 9 January 2019, with the exception of a song sequence and \\"a few patch works\\".  Soundtrack  The soundtrack is composed by Ghibran, continuing his association with the director and Kamal after Thoongaa Vanam. The music rights were bought by Muzik 247.  Release  Kadaram Kondan was released on 19 July 2019, alongside its Telugu-dubbed version Mr. KK. =Box office= According to trade estimates, Kadaram Kondan collection managed to rake in Rs 50 crore in the opening weekend at the box office. = Critical reception = M. Suganth of The Times of India wrote, \\"The action scenes make Kadaram Kondan a visceral experience, even though Rajesh Selva‚Äôs filmmaking falls short on flair. As long as we get a chase or a shootout, the film feels thrilling enough. It is only in the quieter moments, like the initial scenes that set up the story, that get us restless. Thankfully, Ghibran‚Äôs energetic wall-to-wall score lends the film momentum. And Vikram ensures that we don‚Äôt leave disappointed\\". Srivatsan S of The Hindu wrote, \\"A ‚Äòtime bomb‚Äô narrative that takes a while to explode. But when it does, it's a smart guessing game\\". India Today reviewer Kirubhakar Purushothaman rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"Kadaram Kondan is a decent entertainer if one is ready to overlook a few silly contrivances and over-the-top heroism\\". Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion wrote \\"We want a series of set pieces that tumble into one another with wit and elegance and heart-stopping precision. What we get is indifferently staged ‚Äúscenes‚Äù that feel distant and disconnected. (The least you expect in these films is technique.)\\" = Controversy = Although 90 percent of the film was shot in Malaysia, it was not released there. According to Lotus Five Star, holder of the film's distribution and theatrical rights in Malaysia, the film was banned per orders of LPF (Film Censorship Board of Malaysia) due to the story's portrayal of the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) in a negative light and for portraying police officers as corrupt and for scenes which supposedly inaccurately and misleadingly represent the police force. In addition, the makers of the film failed to get necessary police permits to shoot scenes in Malaysia; the Malaysian law requires that film production receives permission from the relevant authorities such as FINAS, PUSPAL and others before shooting.

She ran under the Liberal Party ticket and is known for initially being the least popular candidate, with only 3% voting for her in surveys. She eventually caught up to her closest rival, Bongbong Marcos, in the days leading to the elections. She has constantly been a target of the criticisms of President Duterte, leading to the rift and exchange of remarks between the two leaders.  Domestic policy =Ferdinand Marcos' burial at the Heroes' Cemetery= Members of the Supreme Court, under the recommendation of Duterte, would vote nine to five favoring Marcos‚Äô burial at the Heroes‚Äô Cemetery. Robredo opposed Duterte's approval of the hero's burial for the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, criticizing the secretive burial as ‚Äúlike a thief in the night‚Äù. Robredo released her statements through Facebook and Twitter, stating that ‚ÄúMarcos was a thief, a murderer and a dictator. He is no hero,‚Äù. She also criticized the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police for being complicit and assisting in the execution of the burial. This move was followed by protests from activists and victims, with human rights lawyer Barry Gutierrez describing the burial as ‚Äúagain in defiance of the law‚Äù. = Robredo's resignation from Cabinet = Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City Days after the first informal meeting between President Duterte and Vice President Robredo, the latter would be offered the top post at the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council through a televised phone call. Months later, Robredo would tender her resignation through a letter dated 5 December 2016 to President Duterte. This was after Duterte directed the Vice President to stop attending all Cabinet meetings. Her resignation began to put her as the symbol of the administration's opposition. = Duterte's declaration of state of emergency = With Duterte's open admiration towards former dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his leadership style, his initial declaration of a state of national emergency after terrorist attacks and eventually martial law was met with public fear, despite measures taken by framers of the 1987 Constitution in ensuring that these powers were not to be abused. The Vice President, despite coming from the opposition, respected this declaration for as long as it did not trample on the Constitution or fundamental rights. She remarks, ‚ÄúWe reiterate our call that we bring to justice those responsible for the violence in Davao and at the same time, our bill of rights is followed and treated with utmost respect[.]‚ÄùLeni Robredo at the ASEAN Disability Forum = Human rights, extrajudicial Killings, and impeachment complaints = Robredo would air her concern over the vigilantism and violence associated with the Duterte administration's war on drugs despite her support of the policy. She later condemned the widespread violence committed, adding her opposition against the culture of fear that does not value human rights. Robredo would describe the war on drugs as a front to justify the violence. In March 2017, Robredo would voice out sentiments of Filipinos against the police force. She called for international investigations of the administration's method of conducting its war on drugs, opening up other abuses, such as battering up those who demanded search warrants and detaining relatives of the accused. This message was done on video, which was to be screened at the 60th United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna. Days after, Robredo would be subject to an impeachment complaint to pro-Duterte House Speaker Alvarez for her actions. The complaint was written in a letter sent by Oliver Lozano, a lawyer linked to Ferdinand Marcos, describing her as ‚Äúthe termite of the government‚Äù. President Duterte would defend Vice-President Robredo, telling his allies to stop plans to impeach her because of democracy and freedom of speech.PNP-CIDG officer reads to Senator Leila De Lima her warrant of arrest = Detention of Leila De Lima = Opposition senator Leila De Lima, an ally of Robredo, took on the president by investigating the death squad he was said to operate. After opening up the topic on administration's bloody war in Senate, De Lima would be implicated in the drug charges during her stint as justice secretary, with allegations of a love affair between her driver and bodyguard being exposed. De Lima had expected such charges to be filed against her by her former office, the Department of Justice, and called the possible arrest as ‚Äúfalse and railroaded drug charges.‚Äù Vice President Leni Robredo would slam this move in a statement describing the arrest as ‚Äúthe latest move in a persistent campaign of political harassment.‚Äù In an interview with Time, Robredo expressed how the charges were driven by political opposition, rather than her being guilty of possessing illegal drugs. The arrest of Senator De Lima was not barred by the Supreme Court, with the court voting in October 2017 keeping her in jail. De Lima's appeal for reconsideration would be junked by the Supreme Court in April 2018. Sample political map of federal regions in the Philippines under federalism = Federalism = Robredo would first air her qualms against federalism at a mass oath-taking event in July 2016, adding that she has questions that must be answered before giving her support. She states the varying levels of readiness of the regions, worried about other regions that depend on the national government for income. In February 2017, she would take on a more opposite stance against federalism. She raised the questions on the form and model that the government intends to implement, what the program seeks to solve, readiness of the Philippines, the trustworthiness of the Constitutional Assembly, and the financial independence of local governments. In January 2018, her camp would express their opposition on the alleged plans of the PDP-Laban, President Duterte's party, to abolish the Office of the Vice President under a draft Constitution. Opposition lawyer Christian Monsod stated in July 2018 that the transitory provisions of the draft could be used to nullify Robredo's right to succession. At that same month, Robredo again questioned the need for a transition to federalism. In August 2018, Robredo criticized the controversial video of Presidential Communications Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson and her co-host, Drew Olivar, where the latter made sexualized chants on federalism. Robredo said that the campaign video was not helping the cause of federalism. Before this controversy, Olivar made a viral video cursing Robredo online. The legal team of the Vice President considers filing charges against Olivar for his actions. House Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was among the authors of the revised transitory provisions passed by the House of Representatives The allegation on the abolition of the Vice President's power to succession was achieved in October 2018 by a draft constitution passed by the House of Representatives. Section 4, Article XVII on the Transitory Provisions sets the Senate President, rather than the Vice President, as the successor of the President. This was proposed by Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and 21 other lawmakers. Vicente Veloso, House chairperson on constitutional amendments, cites the instability of the Office of the Vice President given the electoral protest filed by Bongbong Marcos. Robredo's election lawyer, Romulo Macalintal, would call this proposal \\"clearly frivolous if not outright ridiculous\\", questioning the basis of succession on a pending election protest. Robredo criticized the steps taken to set her aside as desperate. This provision was amended days later, restoring Robredo's role in the succession line.  Social policy = Death penalty = During the vice presidential debates of April 2016, Robredo gave her thumbs down on the question on imposing death penalty for the corrupt. In May 2016, the former Congresswoman turned Vice President expressed her opposition against the death penalty. This is contrary to President Duterte's promise to reintroduce capital punishment and to launch a war against crime. This reintroduction was to be applied for drug crimes, rape, murder, and robbery. Robredo's opposition cites that there have been no statistics that link diminished crime with death penalty and wrongful convictions of the death sentence. Pope Francis states the inadmissibility of the death penalty as an \\"attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person\\" President Duterte in September 2016 points out that the growth of atheism and agnosticism has led to a lack of fear and respect for the law, which he uses as a reason to call for the death penalty. In his State of the Nation Address (SONA) in July 2017, Duterte claims that the only way to stop criminals is to instill fear, and he further stresses the role of capital punishment not only as a deterrent, but also for retribution. He warned during Senator Manny Pacquiao's birthday in December 2016 that there would be five to six executions daily. As Congress moves towards reinstating the death penalty, Robredo commented that the bill was rushed \\"to accommodate the wishes of the president.\\" In August 2018, the Office of the President stated it would not give up on reinstating death penalty, in the midst of the opposition of Pope Francis and the Catholic Church. Robredo would speak out against the killings in the drug war, noting that while there is a On need for an anti-drug campaign, rehabilitation of drug addiction is more important. = Divorce = During the campaign period in 2016, Robredo expressed her desire to fix the annulment system before tackling divorce. Her concern was to make it easy to access especially for the poor and marginalized. She also supports the use of physical and emotional abuse as grounds for annulment. Robredo would repeat her views in March 2018, stating her openness towards a divorce bill that even the poor could access. She adds that she does not want, however, people to take marriage for granted, stressing the sanctity of marriage. = Labor and contractualization = On 4 July 2016, Robredo vowed to collaborate with the Duterte government and to push for more jobs and ending contractualization in spite of their political differences. Robredo expressed her gratitude and her move to protect Filipino workers during the International Workers' Day on 1 May 2017. One of the things she proposed is the abolishing of end-of-contract (ENDO) practices, which has been used to abuse and prevent laborers from getting permanent jobs. On 22 April 2018, Robredo called for both workers and employers to talk about a compromise between workers who cannot find permanent jobs because of end-of-contract practices and businesses who become less competitive and run deficits with a strict policy. After the violent dispersal of NutriAsia workers, Robredo on 2 August 2018 said that the harm done on the protesting employees calling for regularization is inexcusable. = Women's rights = Days before her inauguration as Vice President, Robredo expressed her advocacy to work for anti-poverty and pro-women programs. In May 2017, Robredo stated the importance of economic improvements for women to give them greater freedom from abuse. Robredo helps women through the Angat-Buhay Project of her office, which has overseen the growth and of their businesses. Robredo states the importance of quiet strength and collaboration, rather than leading, in promoting gender equality. She has also urged women to protect their right to vote, reminding them of the plebiscite on 30 April 1937 that allowed women to participate in the elections. Robredo has released her statement on feminism and the role of women in inclusive development. She has repeatedly called for men to respect women and to stand up against misogyny and bigotry, stating that inappropriate and tasteless remarks have no place in society. Robredo said on International Women's Day that equal treatment of men and women begins at home, citing the example of teaching young boys to wash their own clothes as a campaign against gender bias. Robredo notes that the current administration has gone back to a culture of misogyny and bigotry, making women politicians disadvantaged at present. President Duterte has released controversial misogynistic statements on Robredo, noting in November 2016 how he and finance secretary Carlos Dominguez stared at Robredo's legs when she wore a short skirt and would change seats to get a better view of her body. Women's group Gabriela and Vice President Robredo would later on flag Duterte's comments as inappropriate. Duterte would later on defend his remarks, saying it was appropriate and natural of politicians to make people laugh, while blaming media for making a big deal out of it. On 31 August 2018, Duterte proclaimed that Davao City has many rape cases because there are plenty of pretty women, which meant there were a lot to rape. Malaca√±ang's spokesperson, Harry Roque, would defend Duterte's rape joke by claiming that it is more liberal in the south, but Gabriela Women's Party and Vice President Robredo slammed Duterte's misogynistic rape jokes. Robredo remarks that rapists are the sole causes of rape and not pretty women.  Economic policy = Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law = Critics of the TRAIN program were wary of the increase in fuel prices which would offset the savings of wage earners from their tax cuts when the first implementation of the program was signed on 19 December 2017. Inflation would rise to four percent in January, continuing to 6.7 percent by October 2018. Robredo called for the government to act on aiding the poor by fulfilling its promised Conditional Cash Transfer program with rising prices of basic goods, whether or not this rise is caused by the TRAIN law. Duterte's economic managers refuse to stop the program, despite calls from senators and various groups to suspend TRAIN. Robredo would release another statement on the matter on 16 August 2018, urging stakeholders to review the TRAIN program given the continuous rise in inflation rate which affects the poor the most. Robredo and the Liberal Party suggested a review of the safety nets that would ease the effect of inflation on the poor. Amid rising prices, Robredo asked the Senate, House of Representatives, and President Duterte to certify as urgent a bill that will stop the added tax on fuel.  Foreign policy = China's militarization in the West Philippine Sea = Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario On 22 May 2018, Robredo and Associate Justice Antonio Carpio suggested that the government should file a formal protest against China's militarization of the area, after a long-range bomber was landed in the contested area. Robredo called for peaceful public action to unite against China's militarization in the West Philippine Sea during the second anniversary of the Philippines' victory in the Permanent Court of Arbitration against China's nine-dash line claim. She lamented the decision of the Duterte government to set aside the Philippines' claim while pushing for better relations with the People's Republic of China. Albert Del Rosario, former Secretary of Foreign Affairs under Benigno Aquino III, criticized the Duterte administration's soft stance towards China, to which it refused to raise the ruling won by the Philippine government in 2016. Del Rosario describes this inaction as putting the award in a \\"deep freeze\\". Robredo brought up the reported tensions between the Chinese Coast Guard and Filipino fishermen where the latter's catch were taken by the former. Robredo described the consequences of China's militarization similar to the devastation of the Philippines during World War II, as the assertion of China's nine-dash line means that the Philippines will lose control over its exclusive economic zone. = Foreign aid sponsored by China = Philippine President Duterte meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a dinner hosted by the latter at the Boao State Guesthouse With the Duterte administration tapping China to finance its infrastructure projects, Vice President Robredo expressed her warnings against falling into a debt trap like Sri Lanka, who now spends 95% of its revenue repaying its debt. Robredo said that assessing the deals made by Duterte with China is difficult due to the lack of transparency on the part of the government. She stresses that while the Philippines is in need of financing, it should not give up its sovereignty. She adds that Filipinos should be more watchful on China's loans, which might come with consequences later on. Robredo said before the Center for Strategic and International Studies- Pertamina Banyan Tree Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C. that China must be dealt with diplomatic resistance if it violates international law. She cites that smaller, less powerful nations could suffer from the aggressive expansionism of China. = Overseas Filipino workers' deployment ban to Kuwait = After news of widespread abuse of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and the discovery of a Filipina worker's body in a freezer in Kuwait, Duterte took steps to protect Filipino workers abroad by ordering distressed OFWs to be sent back. Duterte would ban deployment of OFWs to Kuwait in February 2018, saying that he would ban deployment in countries that abuse Filipino migrant workers. Vice President Robredo supported the move of Duterte to ban OFWs from Kuwait, adding that the incident of the dead Filipina should be an eye-opener to the abuses towards Filipino workers. Robredo urged the government to come up with a bilateral deal with Kuwait to protect the OFWs. On 29 April 2018, Duterte said that the ban would stay permanently and would stop recruitment especially of domestic helpers. Relations between the two countries would go sour with allegations that the Philippine Embassy took distressed Filipinos directly from Kuwaiti households. Robredo called for \\"decisive steps\\" to solve the diplomatic dilemma caused by the rescue missions done by the Philippine Embassy. She adds that both parties must mend ties with \\"a willingness to accept accountability\\" and urged the Department of Foreign Affairs to use its career diplomats to solve the problem. President Duterte would later on lift the ban on 15 May 2018 through a memorandum of agreement signed with Kuwait on 11 May 2018.

Vietnam War The Division was formed on 20 September 1972 from the 28th, 66th and 95th Infantry Regiments. The Division was under the control of the B3 Front. The 95B Regiment was one of the units targeted in Operation Paul Revere IV from 20 October to 30 December 1966. Following the operation the 95B Regiment was rendered combat ineffective. From 8 June to 16 September 1973 the Division fought the Battle of Trung Nghia against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 23rd Division. Prisoners captured by the ARVN at Trung Nghia stated that they had suffered losses of 30 percent on the whole, and that in some units with considerable sickness casualty rates were as high as 60 percent. On 15 May 1974 the Division's 28th Regiment and the 95th Regiment, 325th Division overran Dak Pek Camp. During the 1975 Spring Offensive, as a diversion for the attack on Ban Me Thuot, the Division attacked Duc Lap Camp on 9 March, capturing the base the next day. The PAVN claim to have captured over 100 prisoners, 14 artillery pieces and 20 tanks and armored personnel carriers. On 10 March the Division's 24th Regiment participated in the attack on Ban Me Thuot. On 13 March the Division's 28th and 66th Regiments arrived by truck from Duc Lap and joined the attack. The 24th Regiment supported by tanks attacked the ARVN 45th Regiment, 23rd Division on Hill 581 east of Phung Duc scattering them, killing over 200 soldiers and ending the hopes for a counterattack to retake Ban Me Thuot. On 16 March the 24th Regiment and 8th battalion, 66th Regiment overran the Nong Trai intersection held by the ARVN 45th Regiment and the next the 24th and 28th Regiments assaulted down Route 21 overrunning the ARVN 44th Regiment and Regional Force units. The Division continued its advance down Route 21 attacking the ARVN 40th Regiment 22nd Division and Regional Forces and capturing Khanh Duong by 24 March. On 29 March 1975 the PAVN formed 3rd Corps comprising the Division, 316th and 320th Divisions, the 675th Artillery Regiment, the 312th Anti-aircraft Regiment, 198th Sapper Regiment, 273rd Tank Regiment, 545th Engineer Regiment and the 29th Signal Regiment under the command of Major General V≈© LƒÉng. The Division attacked the ARVN 3rd Airborne Brigade in the M'ƒêrƒÉk Pass and then captured Cam Ranh Bay and Cam Ranh Air Base on 3 April. On 10 April the Division left Cam Ranh and moved along Route 450 to join up with Route 11 to take Dalat, passing within of Phan Rang Air Base. When Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) reconnaissance aircraft observed the movement of the Division, Phan Rang based A-37s began attacking the column, destroying 6 river-crossing vehicles on 10 April, 5 trucks on 11 April, 7 trucks on 12 April and 9 trucks on 13 April. By mid-April the lead elements of 3rd Corps were located at D·∫ßu Ti·∫øng Base Camp ready to attack the northern approaches to Saigon. On 29 April the Division advanced down Highway 1 and attacked ARVN forces at the Quang Trung Training Center. By midnight on 29/30 April the Division's advanced elements had reached the Ba Queo intersection and began attacking Tan Son Nhut Air Base. At 07:15 on 30 April the 24th Regiment supported by tanks approached the Bay Hien intersection () 1.5 km from the base's main gate. The lead T-54 was hit by M67 recoilless rifle and then the next T-54 was hit by a shell from an M48 tank. The PAVN infantry moved forward and engaged the ARVN in house to house fighting forcing them to withdraw to the base by 08:45. The Division then sent 3 tanks and an infantry battalion to assault the main gate and they were met by intensive anti-tank and machine gun fire knocking out the three tanks and killing at least 20 PAVN soldiers. The PAVN tried to bring forward an 85mm antiaircraft gun but the ARVN knocked it out before it could start firing. The Division ordered 8 more tanks and another infantry battalion to join the attack, but as they approached the Bay Hien intersection they were hit by an airstrike from RVNAF jets operating from Binh Thuy Air Base which destroyed two T-54s. The six surviving tanks arrived at the main gate at 10:00 and began their attack, with two being knocked out by antitank fire in front of the gate and another destroyed as it attempted a flanking manoeuvre. At approximately 10:30 the 81st Ranger Group defending the base heard of the surrender broadcast of President D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh and withdrew from the base gates and at 11:30 the Division entered the base.

It is the steepest adhesion railway in Switzerland with a gradient of up to 8.0% and forms part of the network of the Appenzell Railways (AB) and the St. Gallen S-Bahn. The line's two branches were completed in sections between 1889 and 1904 by the St. Gallen-Gais-Appenzell-Altst√§tten Railway and the Trogen Railway. The two lines were connected by the AB with a cross-city route in 2018.  History= St. Gallen-Gais-Appenzell railway = Train of the Appenzell tramway in the Ruckhalde area around 1910. The five BCFeh 4/4 trams dominated the image of the SGA for fifty years after electrification. The former St. Gallen-Gais-Appenzell-Altst√§tten-Bahn (St. Gallen-Gais- Appenzell-Altst√§tten Railway, ASt) opened the line from St. Gallen to Gais, popularly known as the Gaiserbahn, on 1 October 1889. The continuation from Gais to Appenzell followed on 1 July 1904. The route had seven rack sections using the Riggenbach-Klose system with a total length of 4.9 kilometres. Electrical operations at 1500 V DC commenced on 23 January 1931 and its name was changed to St. Gallen-Gais-Appenzell-Bahn (SGA). The difficult line with tight bends demanded new design solutions to enable the BCFeh 4/4 electric railcars to operate over both adhesion and rack sections. Between 1978 and 1983, five of the six rack sections were replaced by new track allowing adhesion operations. All that remained was the nearly one kilometre-long rack section through the Ruckhalde landscape between St. Gallen and Rieth√ºsli. = Trogen Railway= Train of the Trogen Railway in Speicher shortly after the opening of the line Two trains crossing in Speicher in June 1980 The St. Gallen‚ÄìTrogen railway (Trogenerbahn, TB) was opened on 10 July 1903. Originally, the line was electrified at 750 volts DC. The voltage was increased to 900 volts in 1921 and finally to 1000 volts in 1928 with the replacement of the converter group in Speicher by a fully automatic mercury vapour rectifier plant. In the city of St. Gallen, the trains ran on the tracks of the St. Gallen Tramway, which was closed in 1957. Because of the intersections with the city trolleybuses, the contact wire voltage is still only 600 volts. Despite the modest length of its operations, the Trogen Railway has been preserved. The line, which originally ran almost completely on track laid on roads, has been largely moved over the years to its own route. With a gradient of up to 7.6%, the Trogen Railway was the steepest narrow-gauge adhesion line in Switzerland prior to the opening of the Ruckhalde Tunnel. =Cross-city line= Tango train from 2018 to Appenzell on the St. Gallen market square The five sub-projects that made up the cross-city line The Ruckhalde tunnel was the most important structure involved in the development of the cross-city line. South portal of the Ruckhalde tunnel and the new Rieth√ºsli station Since the 1970s, tunnels between St. Gallen and the suburb of Rieth√ºsli have been planned to eliminate the last rack section between St. Gallen and Appenzell. All these projects failed on cost grounds. After the Appenzell Railways (AB) merged with the Trogen Railway (TB), the Rorschach‚ÄìHeiden railway (RHB) and the Rheineck‚ÄìWalzenhausen mountain railway (RhW) in 2006, the Appenzell Railways decided to increase services between St. Gallen and Teufen to 15-minute intervals. This required the shortening of the travel time between St. Gallen and Rieth√ºsli, which was only possible with the removal of the rack section through the Ruckhalde. In order to eliminate the uneconomical service pattern of the trains in the St. Gallen \\"side\\" station (Nebenbahnhof) needed to be connected to the Appenzell‚ÄìSt. Gallen line of the Trogen Railway by the cross-city line, although the two track branches had very different characteristics. The Appenzell‚ÄìSt. Gallen‚ÄìTrogen cross-city line became a key strategic project of Appenzell Railways. The required work was subdivided into five sub-projects, of which the St. Gallen station‚ÄìRieth√ºsli section, including the proposed Ruckhalde Tunnel, which was approximately 700 metre-long, was the most complex and largest. Apart from the construction of the new track, further work was necessary. Thus, the overhead line voltage was raised to 1500 V; previously it had been 1000 V on the Trogen Railway and 1500 V on the St. Gallen-Gais-Appenzell Railway. Teufen station received a third platform track, so that besides the crossings of the regular interval services, trains can reverse there in the peak. The siding to St. Gallen AB station was replaced by a crossover and the double track was extended from the Rathaus (town hall) to the St. Leonhard bridge. In order to simplify operation, the seven signal boxes between Niederteufen and Trogen have been replaced by two new systems, which contain components of the SiGrid interlocking architecture, developed by Siemens. SiGrid connects the external facilities with the interlocking and supplies it with 750 Volt DC power. The cross-city line brings significant improvements to passengers: in addition to the 15-minute cycle between St. Gallen and Teufen, connections to Intercity trains to and from Z√ºrich have been improved. The elimination of the technically complex and expensive to operate rack section in the Ruckhalde has made it possible to use the newly acquired Tango (class ABe 8/12) low-floor trains, which are more comfortable and quieter, but also more cost-effective. The Ruckhalde Tunnel route eliminated the need for six level crossings, which has significantly increased traffic safety in the Rieth√ºsli district. The construction began in the spring of 2016. The cantons of St. Gallen, Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Appenzell Innerrhoden and their municipalities contributed a total of CHF 49 million to the total costs of around CHF 90 million, with the rest being financed by the federal government. While the cross-city line had been duplicated through the St. Gallen station forecourt, the forecourt had also been under renovation since 2015. The new line was opened on 6 October 2018 for a folk festival and scheduled commercial operations began on 7 October. Siemens used an interruption of operations to operate a digital interlocking for the first time anywhere in the world in September 2018. The signal box was operated from a Siemens location in Wallisellen on a trial basis via a public data network.  Route description The separation of train and road is not yet completed in Teufen BDeh 4/4 set in 2011 on the Sitter Viaduct near Appenzell After the line has left the Innerrhoden capital of Appenzell‚Äîwhich is also served by the trains of the Gossau‚ÄìWasserauen railway of the original Appenzell Railway‚Äîit runs over the 296-meter-long imposing Sitter Viaduct to the Hirschberg loop, which offers a magnificent view of Appenzell and the Alpstein. Running next to the road, after passing over a watershed, the railway reaches the crossing station of Sammelplatz and, after about three kilometres of down grade, the entrance of the Ausserrhoden village of Gais. The line, which is now running away from the road, takes a tight 180¬∞ curve into the station of Gais, where the trains that run over the Stoss Pass to Altst√§tten wait, and the depot and workshop buildings of the former SGA are located. At the village exit, the line returns to the edge of the canton road again. On the following downslope are the stops of Zweibr√ºcken and Strahlholz. Before the village of B√ºhler, the line changes to the left side of the street. The line crosses the cantonal road again on the way to Steigbach station. After the Goldibach bridge and a short climb, the line reaches the village of Teufen at the hotel \\"Linde\\". Although the railway runs to a large extent on its own route in Teufen, the countless junctions and the driveways to individual houses demand the utmost attention from road users. The generous station building, built in 1909, houses, along with retail outlets, tenants such as the cantonal police. BDe 4/8 23 set in 2008 in Markt¬≠platz in central St. Gallen St. Gallen side station before the opening of the Ruckhalde Tunnel with a train to Trogen to the left of the entrance building and to Appenzell to the right of the entrance building. The line passes through the stops of Stofel, Sternen, Niederteufen and Lustm√ºhle before reaching the St. Gallen quarter of Rieth√ºsli. Until 2018, train crossings took place at the Liebegg crossing loop 300 metres south of Rieth√ºsli halt. Since 2018, the line has run through the Ruckhalde Tunnel on a decline of 8.0%, losing about 70 metres in altitude, to the level of the once important SBB freight yard in St. Gallen. The tunnel replaced the last remaining rack section, which had impressive view of the western parts of the city, and the sharp Ruckhalde curve. The tunnel also made an approximately 300 metres-long section of overhead line that had been shared with the St. Gallen Trolleybus superfluous. Due to the lower voltage of the trolleybus network, the two forms of transport were electrically isolated from each other. The section with an S-curve leading to St. Leonhard bridge will be replaced by a new double-track section next to the SBB St. Gallen‚ÄìWinterthur railway by the end of 2021. After passing under the St. Leonhard bridge the line reaches the so-called St. Gallen Nebenbahnhof (\\"side station\\"), where a connecting building provides covered access to the standard-gauge trains of the SBB, SOB and Thurbo. The inner city section which has an overhead line voltage of only 600 volts instead of 1500 volts starts in the Nebenbahnhof and the cross-city line runs up to the Br√ºhltor (Br√ºhl gate) parallel to the St. Gallen Trolleybus line of the Verkehrsbetriebe der Stadt St. Gallen (St. Gallen city transport company, VBSG). This section is supplied by a common traction substation. Originally, the trains to Trogen ran in the city on the tracks of the St. Gallen Tramway, which was closed in 1957, but this rail infrastructure now belongs to the Appenzell Railway. After taking over the tram infrastructure from the city of St. Gallen in 1959, the Trogen Railway was required to remove the second track in Bahnhofstrasse (between the station forecourt and the Schibener Gate‚ÄîSchibenertor). The second track in Bahnhofstrasse was not restored until 1978. Trogen terminus with a BDe 4/8 22 set A Be 4/8 set on the slope between Rank and V√∂gelinsegg The cross-city line is built as a tramway to the road junction beyond Br√ºhl Gate. It runs up to Sch√ºlerhaus station on a double-lane track in the right- hand traffic and on grooved rails on the surface of the street. The light-rail vehicles are equipped with turning signals and with a bell, in addition to the normal train whistle. Later, the line follows the St. Gallen‚ÄìSpeicher‚ÄìTrogen cantonal road. From Sch√ºlerhaus, it has its own track with normal flat bottomed rail. In this section, the line has the character of an interurban, with trains passing on the left at the crossings loops, as in usual on Swiss railways, unlike trams. Originally, the track was consistently built on the road on this section. From 1953, the track was moved to its own route with assistance provided under the Privatbahnhilfegesetz (Private Railway Assistance Act), later the Eisenbahngesetz (Railway Act). The last part in the village of Speicher, including the station, was not moved from the road until 1997. The steep section between Sch√ºlerhaus and Notkersegg offers a good view of the city of St. Gallen. Passengers can see the Wenigerweiher (a former millpond) at the Schwarzer B√§ren crossing loop and Lake Constance after the halt of Rank. Shortly after the high point of the line at the monument to the Battle of V√∂gelinsegg (part of the Appenzell Wars) the line changes from the left to the right side of the road and reaches Sch√ºtzengarten halt and then Speicher station, where the depot and workshop of the former Trogen Railway are located. After Bendlehn halt, the line and the cantonal road cross the S√§gibach, a tributary of the Goldach, and after passing through the halt of Gfeld, it reaches its terminus in Trogen, formerly the location of a cantonal assembly (Landsgemeinde).  Operations= Until 2018 = Be 4/8 sets crossing in Schwarzer B√§ren station (2012) Before the opening of the Ruckhalde Tunnel, the St. Gallen‚ÄìAppenzell line was operated as line S 22 of the St. Gallen S-Bahn. The trains ran every half hour and consisted of a BDeh 4/4 motor car, an intermediate car and a control car. Every second train had a low-floor control car. In the working day peak an express service ran from Appenzell to St. Gallen in the morning and returned in the evening peak, taking 39 minutes over the whole line rather than the usual 43 minutes. Two morning and several evening services were replaced by bus services. The St. Gallen‚ÄìTrogen line was operated as line S 21 during the day at half-hour intervals with four Be 4/8 services operated as two additional round trips during the peaks, creating a service every quarter of an hour. With the exception of Speicher, all intermediate stations are request stops. Scheduled train crossing occur in Schwarzer B√§ren station, but in the peak there are also crossings at Speicher and Spisertor. The Trogen line handled freight until mid-1991, largely with freight wagons attached to passenger trains, and until 2007, there were postal consignments in freight wagons. = Since the opening of the cross-city line = ABe 8/12 \\"Tango\\" set in 2018 between Sammelplatz and Hirschberg In the 2019 timetable, the previous service is basically maintained with an additional Appenzell‚ÄìSt. Gallen express service operating in the load direction between Appenzell and St. Gallen in the peak. The regular interval regional services run on the Appenzell‚ÄìTrogen route as line S 21 and on the Teufen‚ÄìTrogen route as line S 22\\\\. The services previously operated in the evening by bus are provided by trains. The two minutes reduction in running time enabled by the Ruckhalde Tunnel required the extension of the Liebegg crossing loop to the Lustm√ºhle halt. The other crossing loops on the Gais branch are located at St. Gallen freight yard, Niederteufen, Teufen and Gais. Since the opening of the Ruckhalde Tunnel, all traffic has been handled by eleven 2.40 metre-wide Tango articulated railcar (class ABe 8/12), which is determined by the structure gauge of the Trogen Railway. The rolling stock previously used on the St. Gallen‚ÄìAppenzell route are 25 centimetres wider. Major maintenance work will ensure that 2.65 metre- wide vehicles can be used for the next generation of rolling stock. = Projects = A new section of double track at the St. Gallen freight yard and a crossing loop at Eggli between Zweibr√ºcken and Strahlholz will allow further travel time reductions between St. Gallen and Appenzell and improve the connections in Gais and Appenzell. The Gais workshop will be replaced by a new service center in Schwende, while only maintenance and minor repairs will be carried out in Speicher.

Cosmopolitan localism fosters a global network of mutually supportive communities (neighbourhoods, villages, towns, cities and regions) who share and exchange knowledge, ideas, skills, technology, culture and (where socially and ecologically sustainable) resources. The approach seeks to foster a creative, reciprocal relationship between the local and the global. Cosmopolitan localism aims to address problems that emerge from globalization‚Äînamely, the subsuming of local cultures and economies into a homogenised and unsustainable global system‚Äîwhile simultaneously avoiding the pitfalls of localization, such as parochialism and isolationism. Italian social innovation scholar Ezio Manzini describes cosmopolitan localism as having the potential to generate a new sense of place. With cosmopolitan localism, places are not considered isolated entities, but nodes in short-distance and long-distance networks. The short- distance networks generate and regenerate the local socio-economic fabric and the long-distance networks connect a particular community to the rest of the world. Cosmopolitan localism is topic of focus for transition designers who explore design-led societal transition toward more sustainable futures. Others have argued that cosmolocalism advances alternatives that could potentially undermine dominant capitalist imaginary significations, attitudes and modalities. It can lead the way for a transition towards a post-capitalist, commons-centric economy and society where value is collectively created and accessible to all. In order for cosmolocalism to become more than a blueprint for a mode of production, the autonomy of local communities and individuals is essential.

J. Lightnin' Album of the Week: Week 2 September 4, 2010 accessed November 7, 2018 The album was first released at around the time the book The Country Blues came out and was an instant success and gave Lightnin's career a well-deserved new lease on life. Lightnin' went on to record many more songs in the '60s and '70s. Reception AllMusic reviewer Thom Owens stated: \\"Upon its initial release, it was a pivotal part of the blues revival and helped re-spark interest in Hopkins. Before it was recorded, the bluesman had disappeared from sight; after a great deal of searching, Sam Charters found Hopkins in a rented one-room apartment in Houston. Persuading Lightnin' with a bottle of gin, Charters convinced Hopkins to record ten songs in that room, using only one microphone. The resulting record was one of the greatest albums in Hopkins' catalog, a skeletal record that is absolutely naked in its loneliness and haunting in its despair. These unvarnished performances arguably capture the essence of Lightnin' Hopkins better than any of his other recordings, and it is certainly one of the landmarks of the late-'50s/early-'60s blues revival\\". The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings awarded the album 3 stars stating \\"'Exciting' may not be the word everyone would choose to describe this intimate, unplugged performance, but it was greeted on its original release with considerable enthusiasm, a response moulded by interpretation of the blues as folk music, suspicion of electric guitars, and other views current in the '50s and '60s among the sort of people who bought Folkways albums. It remains an estimable record\\". Re- release The Roots of Lightnin' Hopkins The album was released in the UK by Verve Folkways as VLP 5003 (mono) and SVLP 5003 (stereo) in 1965 as The Roots of Lightnin' Hopkins and re-released in 1972 by Transatlantic Records (XTRA 1127). In 1990 it was re-released on CD under the title Lightnin' Hopkins by Smithsonian/Folkways (SF 40019), and distributed by Rounder Records.

It can be found on most of the mountains of Korea, except for the norther sides because the temperatures are very low. As the species is highly resistant to shade, cold, salt and even pollution, it is also found in deep forests or near the seas.  Etymology  The genus name, Weigela, is named after the German scientist Christian Ehrenfried Weigel. The species epithet, subsessilis, is from the term subsessile, which means \\"nearly, but not quite sessile.\\" The root, sessilis is derived from Latin, which means low, dwarf in plants. A cultivar with buttery- yellow flowers is known as \\"Canary Weigela\\". The Korean name of the species is 'Î≥ëÍΩÉÎÇòÎ¨¥' (byeongkkot-namu), which means \\"bottle-flower tree.\\" In 1918, the Japanese botanist Nakai gave it this name, as the flowers seemed to look like plain, traditional Korean bottles, which were usually made from gourds.  Description  Weigela subsessilis is a deciduous, broad-leaved, shrubs, which grows from 2~3 meters tall. The species usually coexists with azaleas or royal azaleas, or sometimes clusters itself. It prefers sandy soil, which helps them survive also in barren land. = Foliage = The leaves of Weigela subsessilis has an opposite leaf arrangement, and has a wide egg-shaped body with a sharp tip. The width are up to 2 inches, while the length are up to 3 inches. The leaves have hair on each sides, and the ones on the bottom has spread hair on the leaf veins. It usually does not have petioles, and the edges are slightly toothed. = Flower and fruit = The flowers are produced on new growth from second-year wood as the leaves are expanding. Each inflorescence consists of clusters of three or four, even up to six flowers. When fully open, the flowers measure between 2.5 and 3.5 cm in length. As the flower buds enlarge, they assume a yellowish-green color that gradually changes through various shades of pink to a pale lavender when the flowers are in full bloom. Since inflorescences are profuse and individual flowers represent different stages of maturation, the overall effect of the shrub is a unique combination of pastel colors from pale yellowish-green to lavender.http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/1993-53-4-introducing- weigela-subsessilis.pdf, \\"Introducing Weigela subsessilis\\", Stephen A. Spongberg, Arnoldia Arboretum, Harvard University The flowers usually bloom in late April to May, and the sepals are separated to the end.

It is owned by United Arab Emirates-based international racing operation Godolphin. It was established in 1910 to stand the racehorse Gainsborough and sold in 1981 to Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who operated it as part of his international horse breeding and racing interests, including training horses to race under his own and Godolphin's colours. On his death, Gainsborough Stud passed to Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and became part of the Darley and then the Godolphin operations.  Origins  Gainsborough Stud was originally called Harwood Stud, and was established at Woolton Hill near Newbury, Berkshire, in 1910 by Lady James Douglas as a home for her racehorse Gainsborough, who won the English Triple Crown in 1918. Gainsborough also won the 2,000 Guineas, marking the first time that a horse bred by a woman won one of the British Classic Races and the first time a Classic winner carried a woman's colours. In 1940, failing health forced Lady Douglas to sell Harwood Stud, including Gainsborough. Under an agreement with new owner Herbert Blagrave, Gainsborough remained there until his death in 1945. He is buried on the property, which was eventually renamed Gainsborough Stud in his honour.  International operation  In 1981, the stud farm was bought by Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The stud farm was operated by Maktoum's company, Gainsborough Stud Management, which maintained Gainsborough Farm in central Kentucky (bought in 1984) as well as two facilities in Ireland, Wood Park Stud in Co Meath (bought from the de Burgh family in April 1989) and Ballysheehan Stud. The international operation also stood horses in a number of stud farms in the UK, Ireland and America. In all Maktoum had over 200 horses in training under a roster of ten trainers. Gainsborough-bred horses ran under Maktoum's own colours, the Gainsborough colours and also for Godolphin.  Move to Godolphin  Maktoum was a partner in Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin racing operation and, on his death in 2006, the horses he owned standing at Gainsborough, as well as the stud farm itself, became part of Sheikh Mohammed's Darley breeding operation, including Green Desert, Storming Home, Royal Applause, Cadeaux Genereux, Lucky Story and Fantastic Light, (already under Darley at Dalham Hall) who was named United States Champion Male Turf Horse, European Horse of the Year and European Champion Older Horse in 2001. In Ireland, the operation stood Dilshaan and Key Of Luck at Tara Stud, Kris Kin at Derrinstown Stud, Darley sire Shamardal at Kildangan Stud and Touch Of The Blues at the Irish National Stud. It also had horses in France, Canada and South Africa. Of the three horses standing in America for Gainsborough, two ‚Äì Elusive Quality and Quiet American ‚Äì were moved to Sheikh Mohammed's Jonabell Farm. The third horse, Rahy, had sired Fantastic Light. A new company, Rabbah Bloodstock, was founded to look after the interests of the other owners standing horses at Gainsborough. Soon after the reorganisation, Gainsborough racing manager and champion jockey Joe Mercer retired. In 2016, a fire broke out in cottages at the stud farm, destroying a staff accommodation building.

The N-terminal exons which encode the Vps10p domain are spaced by large introns. The functional receptor protein is largely present in the brain. It is 1109 amino acids long, largely neutral, and has a single transmembrane pass.... SorCS2 is a member of the mammalian Vps10p (vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein) domain family consisting of five transmembrane proteins with structural similarities: SorCS1, SorCS2, SorCS3, SorLA (sorting protein-related receptor with A-type repeats), and sortilin. SorCS2 specifically has critical roles in neuronal viability and function. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the protein has been associated with a range of diseases including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia, and the receptor family has also been associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and type 2 diabetes.  Discovery  The Vps10p domain receptor family was based on the discovery of SorLA in 1996 and sortilin in 1997, and has since been expanded with the SorCS subfamily with SorCS2 being described in 2001 SorCS2 was first found from isolated cDNA in murine floor plate samples of the central nervous system (CNS) as well as in regions of the brain. The cDNA contained the characteristic Vps10p domain enabling its classification as a SorCS protein. Not long after, a corresponding partial cDNA was found in human samples, and it was possible to determine the missing N-terminal by homology to murine SorCS2.  Structure  SorCS2 is composed of a small intracellular region making a single pass into the extracellular environment where the large Vps10p domain make up a beta-propeller structure consisting of 10 propeller blade- like beta sheet regions. The Vps10p domain contains at least 2 unspecific ligand binding sites.. The domain also contains a furin cleavage site. The extracellular region of SorCS proteins also include a LR (leucine rich domain) containing imperfect LR repeats (LRRs) which are known to serve as interaction and adhesion domains Modifications in Vps10p-type receptors include glycosylations. and they also contain a propeptide which is proteolytically cleaved off to make them active In the non-neuronal glia cells, SorCS2 is cleaved and a linkage forms a two-chained product distinct from that in neurons which is a single chained. The processing in glia cells have been linked to proapoptotic properties not found in neuronal SorCS2.. This differential processing is thought to be common in Vps10p domain proteins where it regulates receptor functionality = Dimerization = Unlike the related proteins sortilin and SorLA, a crystal structure has not yet been determined for SorCS2.. Efforts have been made to elucidate the structure of SorCS2 by other methods, and this has allowed determination of dimerization of SorCS2 and the other two SorCS proteins with only few monomeric structures found. This dimerization is promoted by deglycosylation at least in SorCS1. Structurally, the Vps10p domains in SorCS proteins can be found next to each other, but uniquely for SorCS2 it is prevalently found in a dimer where the domains are located away from each other and connected at a two-fold rotation axis for the dimer. The different types of dimers could explain correspondingly different functions of SorCS2 found in different tissues. In addition to the homodimers described, the SorCS proteins also forms heterodimers within this subfamily  Localization  SorCS2 and related proteins in the Vps10p domain family are predominantly found in neurons in the brain, but are also present in other tissues. In terms of brain localization SorCS2 has been found predominantly in thalamus, floor plate of the midbrain and spinal cord, ventricular zones of hippocampal and accumbens areas, meninges, and Schwann cells. The localization is distinct from the other Vps10p receptor sortilin SorCS2 has further been found in tissues that are not brain related in smaller amounts e.g. in structures of mesodermal origin such as adipose tissue, striated muscle tissues, and developing bone as well as connective tissue such as the dermis, submucosal, and submesothelial tissues in the gut, and the bronchial system. Although the presence in these tissues are largely uninvestigated, they still form the basis for further specific functions in non-brain tissue.  Function  All members of the Vps10p protein family are multiligand receptors. They can take part in cellular trafficking and signaling through ligand binding in response to cellular conditions. Examples of ligands are neurotrophic factors, amyloid precursor protein (APP), lipoproteins, and cytokines. In addition to depending on the cellular context, the affinity for specific ligands can also be modulated by the monomer/dimer ratio. = BDNF-dependent plasticity = Hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity is found to be deficient at least in SorCS2 mutant mice, strongly suggesting a link between the two. SorCS2 deficient mice also show decreased long-term memory, higher tendency to take risks, and to have a more stimuli seeking behaviour than corresponding SorCS2 normal mice. The decrease in plasticity is attributed to the fact that SorCS2 forms a complex with p75NTR, a neurotrophin receptor which interacts with proBDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and TrkB (BDNF receptor tyrosine kinase) inside neurons in the hippocampal region of the brain to modulate synapse depression and potentiation respectively. Thus, SorCS2 could be the link between BDNF/proBDNF signaling and mental disorders. Deficiency in this signaling can affect the strengthening and weakening of synapses, that is, neuronal plasticity.  Clinical significance = Alcohol withdrawal = When trying to stop excessive alcohol consumption alcohol withdrawal (AW) is physiological responses that in some cases can cause life threatening seizures. SorCS2 has been associated with the severity of AW in genome analysis of European American test subjects, although no such connection could be made in African American samples A specific SorCS2 risk haplotype disrupts a transcription factor (TF) binding site in a stress hormone-modulated regulatory enhancer element with activity in human hippocampus. This region of the brain is already known for its association with AW. This increases the severity of AW in patients suffering from alcoholism. Exposure to ethanol and glucocorticoids have been found to act as up-regulators of SorCS2, causing worsening of the problems if the risk variant of SorCS2 is present.

The Nazified German Red Cross visited the ghetto in 1943 and filed the only accurate report on the ghetto, describing overcrowding and undernourishment. In 1944, the ghetto was \\"beautified\\" in preparation for a delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Danish government. The delegation visited on 23 June; ICRC delegate Maurice Rossel wrote a favorable report on the ghetto and claimed that no one was deported from Theresienstadt. In April 1945, another ICRC delegation was allowed to visit the ghetto; despite the contemporaneous liberation of other concentration camps, it continued to repeat Rossel's erroneous findings. The SS turned over the ghetto to the ICRC on 2 May, several days before the end of the war. Background=Red Cross= During the Holocaust, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was based in neutral Switzerland. Its policy was to maintain strict neutrality and avoid interfering with Nazi racial persecution, which was viewed as a German internal matter. As early as 1933, the ICRC had received pleas to intervene in favor of concentration camp prisoners, but it was hesitant to accept German invitations to visit concentration camps. Carl Jacob Burckhardt, an ICRC official who made most of the key decisions regarding Nazi Germany, stated in a September 1935 meeting that it was \\"dangerous to occupy oneself\\" with the concentration camps; he was certain that such visits would be exploited by the Nazis for propaganda purposes. Burckhardt did eventually visit Dachau concentration camp; his main complaint was that political prisoners and criminals were not kept separate. The ICRC considered its primary focus to be prisoners of war whose countries had signed the 1929 Geneva Convention, which did not cover civilians. However, as Huber emphasized in a press conference with German reporters in 1940, the ICRC's bylaws did not restrict the organization's mission to detainees covered by the Geneva Conventions. The ICRC took small scale action to help civilians from the beginning of the war in 1939, although the ICRC's leverage against the German government was limited by these detainees' lack of protection under international law. After Adolf Hitler seized power in 1933, the German Red Cross (DRK) elected to conform to the Nazi regime () rather than disband. Schutzstaffel (SS) general Ernst-Robert Grawitz became the head of the DRK in 1937; American historian Gerald Steinacher describes him as a \\"fanatical Nazi\\" and \\"close follower of SS leader Heinrich Himmler\\". Grawitz was closely involved in Aktion T4 (the murder of disabled people) and Nazi human experimentation. According to Steinacher, the appointment of Grawitz signified that the DRK \\"had for all practical purposes [...] turned into a National Socialist medical service unit\\" supporting the German war effort. Questioned by ICRC officials in the early 1930s, the DRK claimed that it had free access to concentration camps, where the inmates were treated well and enjoyed better conditions than the general civilian population. The ICRC had access to independent information describing murders in the camps. On several occasions, the DRK hindered the efforts by the ICRC to help the victims of Nazi persecution. Although , the delegate to the ICRC, has often been praised as one of the only humanitarians in the Nazified DRK, he had been a member of the Nazi Party since 1933. =Theresienstadt= Bed≈ôich Fritta's caricature of Theresienstadt living conditions Theresienstadt was a hybrid concentration camp and ghetto established by the SS in November 1941 in the fortress town Terez√≠n, located in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (German-occupied Czech lands). It was simultaneously a waystation to the extermination camps, and a \\"retirement settlement\\" for elderly and prominent Jews to mislead their communities about the Final Solution. The harsh conditions were deliberately engineered to cause the death of prisoners. Of the approximately 155,000 people sent to Theresienstadt before the end of the war, 35,000 died at the ghetto from hunger and disease and 83,000 perished after deportation to various ghettos, extermination camps, and other killing sites. The ghetto was run by the Council of Elders headed by the \\"Jewish elder\\", which was responsible for implementing Nazi orders. Red Cross involvement with Theresienstadt=ICRC attempts to send supplies= In 1942, the ICRC confirmed the existence of a Jewish ghetto at Theresienstadt and discovered that it was possible to send medicines, emboldening them to try that strategy with other concentration camps. Soon after, Roland Marti, the ICRC delegate in Berlin, requested permission for a trial visit to Theresienstadt, expecting that it would be easier to get permission than for other camps, but his request was denied. The DRK claimed that there was sufficient food and supplies at Theresienstadt, and Red Cross parcels were therefore unnecessary. In May 1943, the ICRC received confirmation signed by the Jewish elder at Theresienstadt that some food parcels had reached it. The ICRC's efforts to send food parcels to concentration camps were hampered by the American Red Cross's refusal to lobby the Allies to allow an exemption in the blockade of Nazi Germany for food imports destined for concentration camps. In order to avoid the parcels being siphoned off by the SS, the ICRC was only allowed to send them to named recipients. =DRK visit (June 1943)= Burckhardt pressured the DRK into visiting Theresienstadt in order to elucidate whether the ghetto was a final destination for Jewish prisoners or a transit point to locations further east. He also wanted to confirm the delivery of food parcels. Adolf Eichmann (and possibly his superiors in the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA)) were eager to allow the visit, as part of a strategy of concealing the Final Solution. On 24, 27, or 28 June 1943, DRK representative Walther Georg Hartmann and his deputy, Heinrich Nieuhaus, were allowed to visit the ghetto, guided by German Foreign Ministry official . They confirmed the delivery of Red Cross supplies and secured permission from the SS that overflows would be sent to other camps, especially Auschwitz concentration camp. In his report, Hartmann described the ghetto's conditions as \\"dreadful\\" and \\"frightfully overcrowded\\"; the prisoners were severely undernourished and medical care was completely inadequate. Of all Red Cross reports on Theresienstadt, Hartmann's was the only one to be broadly accurate. Hartmann leaked his impressions to ICRC official Andr√© de Pilar, who in turn reported them to the ICRC in Geneva and to Gerhart Riegner, secretary of the World Jewish Congress in Geneva, directly in July 1943. Contrary to SS expectations, the visit actually increased DRK suspicions about the Nazi extermination program. =Request for ICRC visit (November 1943)= The Danish government, Danish Red Cross, Danish king Christian X, and Danish clergy also pressured the DRK to allow a visit, because of the 450 Danish Jews who had been deported there in October 1943. The Danish Red Cross began to send food parcels, at a rate of 700 per month, to Danish prisoners even before they were given permission to do so. On a visit to Denmark in November 1943, Eichmann promised that Danish representatives that they would be allowed to visit in the spring of 1944. The ICRC had come under increasing pressure from Jewish organizations and the Czechoslovak government-in-exile to intervene in favor of Jews, although Israeli historian Livia Rothkirchen considers the pressure on the ICRC from Danish institutions to be decisive in prodding the ICRC to renew its request to visit Theresienstadt also in November. The RSHA saw the visit as an opportunity to cast doubt on reports of extermination reaching Western countries, but wanted to prepare the ghetto sufficiently so that the ICRC delegation would get a good impression. =\\"Beautification\\" (February 1944‚ÄìJune 1944)= Fritta mocks the \\"beautification\\" campaign. In February 1944, the SS embarked on a \\"beautification\\" () campaign in order to prepare the ghetto for the Red Cross visit. Many \\"Prominent\\" prisoners and Danish Jews were re-housed in private, superior quarters. The streets were renamed and cleaned; sham shops and a school was set up; the SS encouraged the prisoners to perform an increasing number of cultural activities, which exceeded that of an ordinary town in peacetime. As part of the preparations, 7,503 people were sent to the Theresienstadt family camp at Auschwitz in May 1944; the transports targeted sick, elderly, and disabled people who had no place in the ideal Jewish settlement. In late May, Paul Eppstein, Otto Zucker, and other Theresienstadt leaders were allowed to sign SS-dictated letters, which were sent to the Aid and Rescue Committee, a Jewish organization in Budapest. Rudolf Kastner, the leader of the committee, forwarded the letter abroad. It is unclear to what extent the ICRC valued making an accurate report on Theresienstadt, given that it had access to independent information confirming that prisoners were transported to Auschwitz and murdered there. Leo Janowitz, a member of the Theresienstadt self-administration, had been on the first transport to the family camp in September 1943. The next month, the Auschwitz camp administration allowed him to send a letter to Fritz Ullmann, a Jewish Agency representative in Geneva, with a list of prisoners deported from Theresienstadt. On 16 June 1944, the BBC European Service reported: =23 June 1944 visit= Photo taken by Maurice Rossel at Theresienstadt. Most of the children were murdered at Auschwitz in the fall of 1944. The commission that visited on June 23, 1944, included Maurice Rossel, a representative of the ICRC; E. Juel-Henningsen, the head physician at the Danish Ministry of Health; and Franz Hvass, the top civil servant at the Danish Foreign Ministry. Swiss historians S√©bastien Farr√© and Yan Schubert view the choice of the young and inexperienced Rossel as indicative of the ICRC's indifference to Jewish suffering. However, Swiss historian Jean-Claude Favez argues that the SS were eager to show Theresienstadt to Burckhardt or another high-ranking ICRC representative, while the ICRC worried that such attention would legitimize Nazi propaganda. On 23 June 1944, the visitors were led on a tour through the \\"Potemkin village\\". The visitors spent eight hours inside Theresienstadt, led on a predetermined path and only allowed to speak with Danish Jews and selected representatives, including Paul Eppstein. Driven in a limousine by an SS officer posing as his driver, Eppstein was forced to deliver an SS-written speech describing Theresienstadt as \\"a normal country town\\" of which he was \\"mayor\\", and give the visitors fabricated statistical data on the ghetto. He still had a black eye from a beating administered by Rahm, and attempted to warn Rossel that there was \\"no way out\\" for Theresienstadt prisoners. A soccer game and performance of the children's opera Brundib√°r were also staged for the guests. =Aftermath= Rossel's report stated that conditions in the ghetto were favorable‚Äîeven superior than for civilians in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia‚Äîand that no one was deported from Theresienstadt. Questioned by ICRC official Johannes von Schwarzenberg, he was not able to explain the discrepancy in the ICRC's population figures concerning the ghetto: 30,000 people who were said to have been sent to Auschwitz. The Danish representatives reported that whether Theresienstadt was a transit camp was an \\"open question\\", and expressed sympathy for the prisoners. Although all of the visitors had promised to keep their reports secret, some information from Rossel's report was leaked to the World Jewish Congress, prompting them to protest the inaccuracy of the report and request another ICRC visit to the ghetto. For the remaining prisoners conditions improved somewhat: according to one survivor, \\"The summer of 1944 was the best time we had in Terez√≠n. Nobody thought of new transports.\\" Rabbi Leo Baeck, a spiritual leader at Theresienstadt, stated that \\"The effect [of the Red Cross visit] on our morale was devastating. We felt forgotten and forsaken.\\" Following the publicization of the Auschwitz Protocols in the summer of 1944 describing mass murder at Auschwitz, Jewish organizations pressured the ICRC to visit Theresienstadt again. In the meantime, 18,400 people were deported to Auschwitz in September and October 1944. =Negotiated release (February and April 1945)= Jewish children recuperate in St. Gallen, Switzerland, 11 February 1945. On 5 February 1945, after negotiations with Swiss politician Jean-Marie Musy, Himmler released a transport of 1,200 Jews (mostly from Germany and Holland) from Theresienstadt to neutral Switzerland. This event received international media coverage, and the released prisoners stated that the previous ICRC visit had been staged. The Danish king secured the release of the Danish internees from Theresienstadt on 15 April 1945. The White Buses, organised by the Danish government in cooperation with the Swedish Red Cross, repatriated the 423 surviving Danish Jews. =April 1945 missions= Simultaneously with the first liberations of concentration camps by Western Allied forces, ICRC delegates Otto Lehner and Paul Dunant arrived at Theresienstadt, accompanied by Swiss diplomat Buchm√ºller, on 6 April 1945 and toured the ghetto, escorted by Eichmann. Dunant was allowed to speak to Benjamin Murmelstein, who had become Jewish elder after Eppstein was shot by the SS at the nearby Theresienstadt Small Fortress in September 1944. Lehner viewed the Nazi propaganda film Theresienstadt, which had been filmed at the ghetto before the deportations in fall 1944. Rothkirchen suggests that the main goal of this expedition was to confirm Rossel's findings; she cites a passage in Lehner's report: Later in his report, Lehner repeats Nazi propaganda describing Theresienstadt as a \\"Zionist experiment\\". Following the visit, Lehner and Dunant dined at Czernin Palace in Prague with Eichmann; Karl Hermann Frank, Higher SS and Police Leader for the Protectorate; and , head of the SD in Prague. Eichmann denied that Jews were being killed. Dunant visited Theresienstadt again on 21 April, at which point he issued a report confirming Rossel's and Lehner's findings and claiming that the visits had not been staged. 15,500 prisoners, survivors of the death marches, arrived at Theresienstadt in the final days of the war, starting a typhoid epidemic. After the SS relinquished control of the ghetto on 2 May, Dunant took over the administration and provided aid from a headquarters in Prague. Czechoslovak Red Cross personnel arrived on 4 May, but they focused their efforts on political prisoners at the Small Fortress and, when they did help prisoners in the Jewish ghetto, were dismissive of foreign (non-Czechoslovak) Jews. Impact and assessment According to Czech historian Miroslav K√°rn√Ω, Rossel's report, particularly his insistence that Jews were not deported from Theresienstadt, had the effect of diminishing the credibility of the Vrba‚ÄìWetzler report. Written by two Auschwitz escapees, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, the latter report accurately described the fate of Jews deported from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz‚Äîmost were murdered. Rossel's statement that Jews were not deported from Theresienstadt caused the ICRC to cancel a planned visit to the Theresienstadt family camp, to which Heinrich Himmler had already given his permission. K√°rn√Ω and Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka draw a direct connection between the report and the liquidation of the family camp in July, in which 6,500 people were murdered. Rossel sent his photographs to von Thadden, who showed copies of the photographs in a press conference in an attempt to disprove reports on the Holocaust. Rossel's report has been described as \\"emblematic of the failure of the ICRC\\" to advocate for Jews during the Holocaust. According to Steinacher, the report \\"certainly discredited the organization\\" for its na√Øvet√© or \\"complicit[y] in a cruel fiction\\", especially because Rossel continued to defend his conclusions after the war. More generally, Rothkirchen writes that the fate suffered by the prisoners of the ghetto \\"can be considered the touchstone of the negative role of the ICRC during World War II\\". However, the case of Theresienstadt was not unique; a similar visit to Drancy by Jacques de Morsier in May 1944 produced a \\"glowing\\" report.

It was recorded in 1967 and released in 1968 by their record label Dimension 5, and was the fourth in a series of children's records they created together with Ted Pandel. The album, like its predecessors in the series, contains a set of songs, stories, dances and other activities for young children to engage with, in order to enrich their learning development, and features an array of disparate musical styles. Whereas previous albums in the series featured Haack's innovative, homemade electronic instruments, the music on The Way-Out Record for Children emphases this approach greatly, with repetitious, rhythmic electronic backdrops. Upon its release, the record was commercially unsuccessful but received acclaim from newspaper journalists, and was recommended in several 1970s guides to children's education. After Haack's work received renewed interest in the decades after his 1988 death, the album received acclaim from critics who highlighted the album's electronic experimentation, unlikely psychedelic musical style and status as outsider music. The album has been re-released on several occasions. Background After dropping out of the Juilliard School in 1955‚Äì56, Canadian outsider electronic musician Bruce Haack began a career writing classical, pop and musique concrete compositions, but this was a financially unsuccessful decision. He soon began working with dance instructor Esther Nelson as her accompanist, which led to the creation of the record label Dimension 5, founded by Haack, Nelson and Ted Pandel, Haacks' fellow former student at Juilliard and lifelong collaborator. Allegedly inspired by Haack's lonely childhood, he and Nelson had begun creating educational music for children, and this led to Dimension 5 launching a series of children's records in 1962, beginning with Dance, Sing & Listen, which was followed-up by two other records in 1963 and 1965. For these releases, Haack, despite lacking training in electronic music, began creating primitive electronic instruments with found objects such as \\"disembowelled radios.\\" Such instruments included the Sono Vocal Chorus Electronique, the Horn Fuse Plateau and the Electric Wind Tunnel. The albums were recorded at Pandel and Haack's apartment, and were characterised by mixing activity and story songs (not unlike other children's albums of the era) with an eclectic array of musical styles, such as medieval music, country, classical and pop, with instruments such as banjo, piano and synthesisers. Haack's homemade electronic instruments, which used modular synthesis, were capable of random composition and 12-voice polyphony, and were recorded using a pair of two-track reel-to-reel tapes, with tape echo added to the music for a moody vibe. The albums, with their naive, homedrawn cover artwork, were commercially unsuccessful, but ‚Äì according to Nelson ‚Äì engaged children due to Haack's \\"lack of self-consciousness,\\" which was apparent in the music's \\"magpie-like imagination, jumping from one glittering fascination to another, combining instruments sounds and styles\\" according to author Mark Brend. The fourth instalment in Dimension 5's children's record series, The Way-Out Record for Children was recorded in 1967 by Haack and Nelson (credited as Miss Nelson) with Tony and Harry Spiridakis, Risa and Mara Sokolsky and Praxiteles Pandel, although the album is primarily credited to Haack. It was the first volume in the series for three years. Production and composition Although Haack's usage of electronic instrumentation had featured in the series since the first volume, he had turned his attention to creating wholly electronic music for children by the time of The Way-Out Record for Children, which was the first album to exemplify this. Brend writes: \\"Simple, repetitive and rhythmic, it was like kindergarten Kraftwerk, its innocence and playfulness at odds with to opaque theorizing of the adult rock album he was beginning to make at the same time.\\" According to Heather Phares of AllMusic, the album coincided with the musical climate of the 1960s becoming more receptive to Haack's \\"kind of whimsical innovation.\\" In this era, Haack won several awards for his music, and his business manager and collaborator Chris Kachulis found mainstream outlets for the musician, including writing music for television advertisements for brands including Kraft Cheese and Parker Brothers. The album led to Haack and Nelson demonstrating how to operate synthesizers on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in 1968. The album has been described as psychedelic in style, and edges towards the acid rock-influenced style that Haack and Nelson explored on subsequent releases like The Electric Lucifer (1970). Writer Joseph Morpurgo described the album as \\"a series of cross-genre digital experiments.\\" Although the record is stylistically different than previous Dance, Sing & Listen releases, it remains similar in that Haack and Nelson provide songs, stories, dances and other activities for children to respond to, in order to encourage learning enrichment. Several games and dances require children to get up and move around, and movement songs on the record include \\"Medieval Dancing\\". The album begins with \\"Introduction\\" where the record's creators introduce themselves, similarly to their previous albums. \\"School for Robots\\", an \\"ear-body coordination game,\\" feature Haack's robotic-style vocals, achieved by speaking in monotone and tapping his Adam's apple. The musician's sense of humour is present on the track through puns like \\"Greetings, fellow robots. I hope oil goes well with you. Here is your robot music. Do not rust until you can dance to it.\\" \\"Mudra\\" teaches children about India through recited \\"tripped out astral poetry\\" and sitar grooves laid atop synthesiser bleeps. Writer Mike Oxman wrote that the following song \\"Accent\\" veers abruptly \\"from a jaunty Schoolhouse Rock-type pop song to segments instructing children to clap poly-rhythmically over odd and time signatures. The jarring changes of melody, style and tone seemed directly inspired by Haack's study of modern composition.\\" The instrumental \\"Rubberbands\\" features electronic experimentation, with its bouncy synthesiser melody and \\"elastic bowing\\" of a Jew's harp. Release and reception Although recorded in 1967, Dimension 5 did not release The Way-Out Record for Children until 1968. Haack's manager Chris Kachulis, who contributes vocals to the record, designed its artwork. Author Nick DiFonzo included the album sleeve in his 2004 book of the worst album covers of all time.Nick DiFonzo, The WORST album covers in the world...EVER! London, UK; New Holland Publishers, 2004 at p. 38. The album cover may be viewed here; www.brucehaack.com. Author Richard Metzger interpreted the album title as a reference to Perrey and Kingsley's 1966 album The In Sound from Way Out!. The album sleeve quoted several of its pre-release reviews; The New Yorker praised the record for engaging children, while Eveleyn LeMone of Dance Magazine said the album was \\"fun to work to and just to sit and listen to‚Äìfor anyone.\\" She said it was \\"small wonder\\" that the series \\"have the recommendation of N.Y.C.'s Board of Education and numerous professionals.\\" Meanwhile, George A. Woods of The New York Times said the album was \\"[i]ncredibly varied and gives off sounds that UFOs would make - if there were such things. And if there are they can drop in anytime as long as Bruce and Miss Nelson are aboard.\\" A writer for American Record Guide wrote that his three children, aged between 5-10, enjoyed the album, especially \\"Motorcycle Ride\\". He felt that the album showed that Haack and Nelson \\"are even more imaginative\\" than contemporaries like the Babysitters, citing the album's large usage of \\"electronic sound to excellent effect,\\" in addition to its wide array of instruments. Although they felt the album, priced at $5, was unusually expensive for a \\"bargain-priced kiddy disc,\\" they nonetheless conceded the record was \\"likely to be requested ten times more often than the collections of teddy-bear songs and sloppily dramatized stories which make up the great bulk of children's records.\\" The review concluded that the album appeals \\"to the creative energies and they elicit active responses,\\" and the vinyl is \\"likely to wear out long before your children's interest in hearing them.\\" In her 1974 manual School Before Six: A Diagnostic Approach Volume 2, Laurel Hodgden recommended the album to parents of young children to encourage their children's \\"spontaneous movement\\" and for \\"listening to in a variety of environments.\\" In her 1975 book on dance in elementary education, Ruth Lovell Murray wrote that, compared to earlier volumes in Dimension 5's children's music series, The Way-Out Record for Children and The Electronic Record for Children both \\"offer particularly good possibilities for exploration and improvisation.\\" She suggested \\"School for Robots,\\" \\"Accents,\\" \\"Rubber- bands,\\" \\"The Saucer's Apprentice\\", \\"Four Seasons\\" and \\"Tools\\" for tutors. In her 1976 book Talkabout: An Early Childhood Language Development Resource, Volume 2, Judith Pasamanick included the album in a list of \\"unusually evocative records and books\\" for parents to use in musical activities with their preschool-age children. She called it \\"one groovy record\\" and highlighted \\"such gems\\" as \\"\\"A Motorcycle Ride,\\" \\"School for Robots,\\" \\"Rubberbands,\\" and \\"The Saucers' Apprentice.\\" Legacy Following Haack's death in 1988, his work received renewed interest in the 1990s and 2000s. In a retrospective review of The Way-Out Record for Children for AllMusic, Heather Phares praised Haack's \\"robotic\\" vocals in \\"School for Robots,\\" writing \\"this low-budget innovation is just another manifestation of his practical but innovative approach.\\" A review for Gullbuy felt the album \\"does not show any wear for its years. Any modern musician would consider themselves blessed if they could create an LP like this.\\" The reviewer's only criticism was Haack's lowly-mixed vocals, but conceded that \\"the voice problem is by design.\\" The album was highlighted for its \\"electronic sound pioneering\\" in Vivian Vale's 1993 book Incredibly Strange Music: Volume 1. Richard Gehr of Spin said that The Way-Out Record for Children and Mort Garson's The Wozard of Iz were innovative examples of \\"state-of-the-art electronic music for kids all ages.\\" Mike Oxman of the National Music Centre felt that Haack and Nelson's children's albums were examples of classic electronic outsider music, and further cited \\"Mundra\\" and \\"Accent\\" from The Way-Out Record for Children as examples of Haack's \\"boundless creativity\\" that displayed his \\"mad genius, infused with the ethos of the 60s.\\" In 2012, Fact Magazine included the album in a list of recommended \\"alternative children's music\\", with writer Joseph Morpurgo writing that the album's \\"trippy olio of looped vocals, wailing synths and vocodered bedtime stories operates in a zodiac of its own.\\" While crediting with Haack as an electronic pioneer with a discography of treasured \\"oddities,\\" he felt that \\"The Way Out Record For Children is probably the strangest of the bunch,\\" and said: \\"In spirit, it‚Äôs very much in keeping with the lunatic surrealism of Ren and Stimpy or SpongeBob SquarePants. More than anything else, though, it shows how liberating the remit of composing for the young can be: Haack rarely sounded this unapologetically unhinged again.\\" In another Fact Magazine list documenting great 1950s and 1960s electronic albums, Morpurgo said that the \\"frazzled album for nippers combines electronic experimentation and whimsy to great effect.\\" A cassette version of the album entitled The Way-Out Cassette for Children was released by Dimension 5 in 1987. The Way-Out Record for Children was reissued by King Record Co. in 2004, and the record label Mississippi reissued both The Way-Out Record for Children and its follow-up The Electronic Record for Children in 2012.

Life He was the son of Francis Twiss, a merchant from Norwich, and was baptised in Rotterdam on 5 April 1759; Richard Twiss was his elder brother. He was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1776, where he studied for a year. In London during the early 1780s, Twiss took an interest in the stage, and wrote some criticism. He met John Philip Kemble, and took an interest in his sisters, marrying in the end Fanny. He also encountered Elizabeth Inchbald, giving her constructive help with her dramatic writing. Twiss died at Cheltenham on 28 April 1827, aged 68. Works Twiss published in two volumes in 1805, A complete verbal Index to the Plays of Shakspeare, adapted to all the editions, with a dedication to John Philip Kemble. It gives the word only not the longer passage in which it occurs, as later concordances did. Of 750 copies printed of it, 542 were destroyed by fire in 1807. Praised by James Boaden two decades later, it was in its time more convenient than the comparable work of Samuel Ayscough. Family Frances Kemble, portrait c.1783 by Joshua Reynolds Twiss married on 1 May 1786 Frances Kemble (1759‚Äì1822), known as Fanny. She was the second daughter of Roger Kemble, the sister of Sarah Siddons, and had been courted unsuccessfully by George Steevens. An actor though not very successful, on marriage she retired from the stage, which gladdened her sister. Later, from 1807 she kept a fashionable girls' school at 24 Camden Place, Bath, Somerset. Fanny Twiss predeceased her husband, dying at Bath on 1 October 1822. Their eldest son was Horace Twiss; another son, John Twiss, became a major-general in the army in 1864, and was governor of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. There were four daughters of the marriage, one of whom died young.

Born in Sragen Regency on the island of Java, Mangundiprojo joined a nationalist group during the Second World War. He later fought against the return of Dutch colonial authority to Indonesia, and later went on to become a politician. He died in Bandar Lampung in 1988.  Biography  Muhammad Mangundiprojo was born on 5 January 1905 in the Javanese province (which are referred to as regencies) of Sragen. At the time, Java and many other Indonesian armies constituted the Dutch East Indies, a colonial possession ruled by the Netherlands. Mangoendiprodjo's family had a history of fighting against the Dutch; his great grandfather had served the Sultanate of Demark and had fought alongside Diponegoro, a 19th-century Javanese noble whom had opposed Dutch rule in the Java War. During his formative years, Mangundiprojo chose to pursue the career of becoming a civil servant in the Dutch colonial government. In 1926, he graduated from a Dutch- operated university on Java and planned to join the Municipal Police. However, he instead became a prosecutor in the Jombang Regency. During World War II, the Japanese army invaded and occupied Java in 1942. The Japanese dismantled much of the island's colonial infrastructure and chose to support nationalist movements which would oppose the return of Dutch authorities. On such effort was PETA, which Mangundiprojo joined in 1944. Before being deployed, he received a military education Surabaya; he was then given command of a unit in the Sidoarjo Regency in East Java. When the war ended in 1945, many of the PETA units were disarmed. However, many soldiers and officers, including Mangundiprojo, maintained their military training and discipline. With the war over, the Dutch government sought to regain control over its former colony in Indonesia, which had declared itself independent from the Netherlands on 17 August 1945. On 26 October, British soldiers and men from the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration landed in Surabaya to occupy the city, which had recently been evacuated by the Japanese garrison. This act caused tensions to flair between the British and the local Indonesians, many of whom now considered themselves to be citizens of an independent Indonesia. Violence soon began, and soon former members of PETA, including Mangundiprojo, began to fight against the British forces. A ceasefire was called on 29 October, and local resistance leader Oerip Soemohardjo selected Mangundiprojo to work with the British to ensure the ceasefire was maintained. While touring the city with British brigadier Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby, the British officer attempted to secure the safe return of a group of Indian soldiers whom had been surrounded by a crowd of independence supporters. The situation escalated when Mangundiprojo was briefly captured by the Indian soldiers, and in the confusion Mallaby was killed by a member of the crowd while the brigadier sheltered in his car. His death provoked a reprisal by the British, starting the battle of Battle of Surabaya. Mangundiprojo fought during the battle against the British. During the later Indonesian war of Independence, Mangundiprojo played a role in seizing a large sum of money that the Dutch colonial authorities were keeping in a bank. After the war of Independence, Mangundiprojo joined the Indonesian civil service. He served as the Regent of Ponorogo from 1951 to 1955. Mangundiprojo died in Bandar Lampung in 1988. In 2014, he was posthumously named as a National Hero of Indonesia.

He is noted for writing tunes performed by some of Egypt's leading singers. Life and career Ezz Eddin Hosni was the son of Arabic language and Islamic calligrapher, Mohammad Hosni, and his first wife, a middle classed Egyptian woman.Aawsat, No. 828, 3 August 2001, Online: He was the oldest child in what became a very large family. He had three full brothers (Nabil, Farouk and Sami) and four full sisters (Khadega, Samira, Nagat and Afaf); and following his parent's divorce, he had three half-sisters (Kawthar, Soad, Sabah) from his father's second marriage and an additional three young half- brothers (Gaheer, Gasser and Galaa (named after the Egyptian ceremony) plus three half-sisters (Gehan, Janjah and Geely) from his mother's second marriage, giving a total of sixteen siblings. He was raised in his father's home in the Khan El-Khalili, Egyptian folk and vibrant district of central Cairo, where Naguib Mahfouz written about. His father's house became known as \\"the home of the artists.\\" Given his father's reputation as a master Arabic calligrapher and teacher, leading artists and calligraphers usually visited the Hosni home. The children's creative talents were nurtured; their father took them to the theatre, provided them with the best tutors and introduced them to other prominent Egyptian artists.It may be worth noting that some sources, especially Arabic media reports, occasionally repeat stories that Hosni was cruel father and denied his daughters an education. These rumours appear to be based on a largely fictionalised TV drama, but have been repeated in the Arabic media, and in at least one Dictionary of Biography (\\"Suad Hosni\\" in: Ginsberg, T. and Lippard, C., Historical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema, Scarecrow Press, 2010, pp 181-182). Hosni's son, Ezz Eddin, dismissed these rumours about his family life, stressing that he and his siblings were raised in a supportive and artistic household where their talents were nurtured from a very young age.

When Ezz Eddin was aged six, he came across the oud made for him and began to play. His father soon recognised the boy's talent and found him a teacher who recommended that the boy study the violin because it had greater potential as a career. After completing his secondary education, Ezz Eddin studied at the Fuad Institute of Music where he became a highly accomplished violinist and also learned to play other instruments, including the piano.\\"Ezz- Eldin Hosni (brother of Nagat Al Saghira) Goes in Silence,\\" (Obituary), Alittihad, 21 October 2013 Online: As a boy, he was influenced by the prominent Egyptianmusician Riyad al-Sunbati who wrote many songs for the influential Egyptian singer, Umm Kulthum.

Fleming Revell He worked among both miners and Tlingits. He established the Fort Wrangell Tlingit Industrial School to teach young Tlingit men various American trades, such as printing, boatbuilding, and construction. This institution was a parallel to Sheldon Jackson's Sitka Industrial Training School, which became Sheldon Jackson College. The Wrangell Institute was established by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in 1932, on a site a few miles south of Wrangell, with an initial intake of 71 students. It was described as \\"one of the pet projects of the Roosevelt Administration\\". Children were forced by the BIA to attend the school, which for some was a traumatic experience as they were flown from the open tundra of their home to a forested and mountainous region where they were forbidden to speak their native language and in some cases were subjected to violence and sexual abuse. During World War II, in 1942, Aleuts were evacuated to a tented encampment on the site. The school closed in 1975, partly as a result of the \\"Molly Hootch case\\" (Tobeluk v. Lind) which forced the government to provide local schools in villages with eight or more children.

By using this technique, it is possible to discriminate small RNAs from the larger RNA family to better understand their functions in the cell and in gene expression. Small RNA-Seq can analyze thousands of small RNA molecules with a high throughput and specificity. The greatest advantage of using RNA-seq is represented by the possibility of generating libraries of RNA fragments starting from the whole RNA content of a cell.  Introduction  Small RNAs are noncoding RNA molecules between 20 and 200 nucleotide in length, which are contained in the bigger class of ncRNAs. In particular, the term ‚Äúsmall‚Äù refers to bacteria, while for eukaryotic cells the more general term ‚ÄúncRNA‚Äù is used. Storz G. (2002 May 17). \\"An expanding universe of noncoding RNAs\\". Science. 296(5571):1260-3. doi:10.1126/science.1072249. . . These molecules are characterized by the presence of a high density of STOP codons and very short ORF sequences: for this reason, they are not involved in coding, but they act as regulators of gene expression in the cell. Descriptive scheme of RNA molecules Small RNAs include several different classes of noncoding RNAs, depending on their sizes and functions: snRNA, snoRNA, scRNA, piRNA, miRNA and siRNA. Their functions go from RNAi (specific for endogenously expressed miRNA and exogenously derived siRNA), RNA processing and modification, gene silencing (i.g. X chromosome inactivation by Xist RNA), epigenetics modifications modifications, protein stability and transport. Small RNA \\"is unable to induce RNAi alone, and to accomplish the task it must form the core of the RNA‚Äìprotein complex termed the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), specifically with Argonaute protein‚Äù. Robert A. Meyers (2012). Epigenetic Regulation and Epigenomics, p. 366.  Small RNA sequencing = Purification = This step is very critical and important for any molecular-based technique since it ensures that the Small RNA fragments found in the samples to be analyzed are characterized by a good level of purity and quality. There are different purification methods that can be used, based on the purposes of the experiment: * acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction: it is based on the use of a guanidinium-thiocyanate solution combined with acid phenol that disrupts cell membranes bringing in solution the nucleic acids and inactivating cellular ribonucleases (chaotropic agent). After this step an aliquot of chloroform is added in order to separate the aqueous phase (containing the RNA molecules) from the organic phase (cellular debris and other contaminants). * spin column chromatography: universally used method to purify nucleic acids that exploits a spin column containing a special resin that, after a first step of cell lysis, allows the binding of the RNA molecules, eluting unbound particles (several proteins and rRNA) Citartan M, Tan SC, Tang TH. (2012 January 28). \\"A rapid and cost effective method in purifying small RNA\\". World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology. 28(1):105-11. doi: 10.1007/s11274-011-0797-0. . . The protocol includes two separate chromatographic runs: the first one is required to isolate the whole RNA content from the sample, while the second one is specific for the isolation of small RNA by adding a small RNA enriched matrix to the column and by using a specific buffer to finally elute them. This method can separate small RNA molecules without the need of adding phenol Donald C. Rio, Manuel Ares Jr, Gregory J. Hannon, and Timothy W. Nilsen (2011). \\"RNA: A Laboratory Manual\\". CSHL Press. . Once small RNAs have been isolated, it is important to quantify them and to evaluate the quality of the purification. There are two different methods to do this: * analysis of the absorbances and gel electrophoresis: this practical approach exploits the use of a spectrophotometer to evaluate the absorbance of RNA molecules at 260 nm (1 OD = 40 Œºg/ŒºL) in order to estimate their concentration and to discover possible contaminations (i.g. proteins or carbohydrates); this can be coupled with an electrophoretic run performed in denaturating conditions (8 M urea) to analyze the quality of the purification extracts (low quality extracts will be degraded and displayed as smears in the gel). * Agilent bioanalyzer: fully automated technique that is based on the use of a special apparatus composed by a chip that allows to perform capillary electrophoresis (CE) using small aliquots of the starting samples and obtaining an electropherogram that is useful to estimate the quality of the extracts thanks to a score (ranging from 1 to 10) attributed by the system. = Library preparation and amplification = Many of the NGS sequencing protocols rely on the production of a genomic library that contains thousands of fragments of the target nucleic acids that will then be sequenced by proper technologies. According to the sequencing methods to be used, libraries can be created differently (in the case of the Ion Torrent technology RNA fragments are directly attached to a magnetic bead through an adapter, while for Illumina sequencing, the RNA fragments are firstly ligated to the adapters and then attached to the surface of a plate): generally, universal adapters A and B (containing well known sequences comprehensive of Unique Molecular Identifiers that are used to quantify small RNAs in a sample and sample indexing that allows to discriminate between different RNA molecules deriving from different samples) are ligated to the 5' and 3' ends of the RNA fragments thanks to the activity of the T4 RNA ligase 2 truncated. After the adapters are ligated to both ends of the small RNAs, retrotranscription occurs producing complementary DNA molecules (cDNAs) which will be, eventually, amplified by different amplification techniques depending on the sequencing protocol that is being followed (Ion Torrent exploits the emulsion PCR, while Illumina requires a bridge PCR) in order to obtain up to billions of amplicons to be sequenced . Besides the regular PCR mix, masking oligonucleotides targeting 5.8s rRNA are added to increase sensitivity to small RNA targets and to improve the amplification results. Caution has to be used, as RNA samples are prone to degradation, and further improvement of this technique should be oriented towards the elimination of adapter dimers Hagemann-Jensen M, Abdullayev I, Sandberg R, Faridani OR (2018 October). \\"Small-seq for single-cell small-RNA sequencing\\". Nature Protocols. 13(10):2407-2424. doi: 10.1038/s41596-018-0049-y. . . = Sequencing = Depending on the purpose of the analysis, RNA-seq can be performed using different approaches: * Ion Torrent sequencing: NGS technology based on the use of a semiconductor chip -where the sample is loaded- integrated with an ion-sensitive field-effect transistor able to sensitively detect reductions of the pH value due to the release of one or more protons after the incorporation of one or more dNTPs during sequencing by synthesis: the signal is, then, transmitted to a machine composed of an electronic reading board -to interface with the chip-, a microprocessor -for signal processing- and a fluidics system -to control the flow of reagents over the chip- Rothberg JM, Hinz W, Rearick TM, Schultz J, Mileski W, Davey M, Leamon JH, Johnson K, Milgrew MJ, Edwards M, Hoon J, Simons JF, Marran D, Myers JW, Davidson JF, Branting A, Nobile JR, Puc BP, Light D, Clark TA, Huber M, Branciforte JT, Stoner IB, Cawley SE, Lyons M, Fu Y, Homer N, Sedova M, Miao X, Reed B, Sabina J, Feierstein E, Schorn M, Alanjary M, Dimalanta E, Dressman D, Kasinskas R, Sokolsky T, Fidanza JA, Namsaraev E, McKernan KJ, Williams A, Roth GT, Bustillo J (2011 July). \\"An integrated semiconductor device enabling non-optical genome sequencing\\". Nature. 475(7356):348-52. doi:10.1038/nature.10242. .. * Illumina sequencing: it offers a good method for small RNA sequencing and it is the most widely used approach . After the library preparation and amplification steps, the sequencing (based on the use of reversible dye-terminators) can be performed by using different systems, such as Miseq System, Miseq Series, NextSeq Series and many others, according to the applications Quail MA, Smith M, Coupland P, Otto TD, Harris SR, Connor TR, Bertoni A, Swerdlow HP, Gu Y (2012 July). \\"A tale of three next generation sequencing platforms: comparison of Ion Torrent, Pacific Biosciences and Illumina MiSeq sequencers\\". BMC Genomics. 13:341. doi:10.1186/1471-2164-13-341. . = Data analysis and storage = The final step regards analysis of data and storage: after obtaining the sequencing reads, UMI and index sequences are automatically removed from the reads and their quality is analyzed by PHRED (software able to evaluate the quality of the sequencing process); reads can then be mapped or aligned to a reference genome in order to extract information about their similarity: reads having the same length, sequence and UMI are considered as equal and are removed from the hit list. Indeed, the number of different UMIs for a given small RNA sequence reflects its copy number. The small RNAs are finally quantified by assigning molecules to transcript annotations from different databases (Mirbase, GtRNAdb and Gencode) . = Applications = Small RNA sequencing can be useful for: * studying the expression profile of miRNA and other small RNAs * increasing the understanding of how cells are regulated or misregulated under pathological conditions * small RNA clustering * novel small RNA discovery * small RNA prediction * differential expression of all small RNAs in any sample  References  See also  * Barquist L, Vogel J (2015). \\"Accelerating Discovery and Functional Analysis of Small RNAs with New Technologies\\".

With Stockton he played on the losing side in the 1907 FA Amateur Cup Final. Life and career Featherstone was born in Middlesbrough in 1885. He played football for Darlington St Hilda's, where he acquired a reputation as a scorer of spectacular goals, and for Northern League club Darlington. By 1905, he was on the books of Stockton.

Improved methods for the extraction of ancient DNA (aDNA) from museum artifacts, ice cores, archeological or paleontological sites, and next- generation sequencing technologies have spurred this field. It is now possible to detect genetic drift, ancient population migration and interrelationships, the evolutionary history of extinct plant, animal and Homo species, and identification of phenotypic features across geographic regions. Scientists can also use paleogenomics to compare ancient ancestors against modern-day humans.  Background  Initially, aDNA sequencing involved cloning small fragments into bacteria, which proceeded with low efficiency due to the oxidative damage the aDNA suffered over millennia. aDNA is difficult to analyze due to facile degradation by nucleases; specific environments and postmortem conditions improved isolation and analysis. Extraction and contamination protocols were necessary for reliable analyses. With the development of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in 1983, scientists could study DNA samples up to approximately 100,000 years old, a limitation of the relatively short isolated fragments. Through advances in isolation, amplification, sequencing, and data reconstruction, older and older samples have become analyzable. Over the past 30 years, high copy number mitochondrial DNA was able to answer many questions; the advent of NGS techniques prompted far more. Moreover, this technological revolution allowed the transition from paleogenetics to paleogenomics. Sequencing methods= Challenges and techniques = PCR, NGS second generation, and various library methods are available for sequencing aDNA, besides many bioinformatics tools. When dealing with each of these methods it is important to consider that aDNA can be altered post-mortem. Specific alterations arise from: * Basis mutational patterns sequence data (C->T mutation) * Crosslinks * Cytosine deamination (increased towards read termini) * Depurination * Genome fragmentation Specific patterns and onset of these alterations help scientists to estimate the sample's age. Formerly, scientists diagnosed post-mortem damages using enzymatic reactions or gas chromatography associated with mass spectroscopy; in more recent years scientists began to detect them by exploiting mutational sequence data. This strategy allows to identify excess of C->T mutations following treatment with uracil DNA glycosylase. Nowadays, one uses high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to identify depurination (a process that drives post-mortem DNA fragmentation, younger samples present more adenine than guanine), single strand breaks in double helix of DNA and abasic site (created by C->T mutation). A single fragment of aDNA can be sequenced in its full length with HTS. With these data we can create a distribution representing a size decay curve that enables a direct quantitative comparison of fragmentation across specimens through space and environmental conditions. Throughout the decay curve it is possible to obtain the median length of the given fragment of aDNA. This length reflects the fragmentation levels after death, which generally increases with depositional temperature.Orlando L., Gilbert MT., Willerslev E. 2015. Reconstructing ancient genomes and epigenomes. Nat. Rev. Genet. 16(7):395-408. =Libraries= Two different libraries can be performed for aDNA sequencing using PCR for genome amplification: * Double-stranded aDNA library (dsDNA library) * Single-stranded aDNA library (ssDNA library) The first one is created using the blunt-end approach. This technique uses two different adaptors: these adaptors bind randomly the fragment and it can then be amplified. The fragment that does not contain both adaptors cannot be amplified causing an error source. To reduce this error, Illumina T/A ligation was introduced: this method consists in inserting the A tailing in DNA sample to facilitate the ligation of T tailed adaptors. In this methods we optimize the amplification of the aDNA. To obtain ssDNA libraries, DNA is first denatured with heat. The obtained ssDNA is then ligated to two adaptors in order to generate the complementary strand and finally PCR is applied. =aDNA Enrichment= As aDNA may contain bacterial DNA or other microorganisms, the process requires enrichment. In order to separate endogenous and exogenous fractions, various methods are employed: * Damaged template enrichment: Used when constructing an ssDNA library because this method targets DNA damage. When Bst polymerase fills the nick, the sample is treated with uracil DNA glycosylase and endonuclease VIII. These compounds attack the abasic site. The undamaged DNA remains attached to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads and can be separated from the sample. This method is specific for samples from late Pleistocene Neanderthals. * Extension-free target enrichment in solution: this method is based on target-probe hybridization. This method requires DNA denaturation and then inserts overlapping tiled probes along target regions. Then, PCR for DNA amplification is used and finally DNA is linked to a biotinylated adaptor. It's useful for samples from Archaic hominin ancestry. * Solid-phase target enrichment: in this method microarray and real-time PCR method are used in parallel with shotgun sequencing screening. * Whole-genome enrichment: used for sequencing the entire genome of single individuals. Whole-genome In-Solution Capture (WISC) is used. This method starts with the preparation of a genome-wide RNA probe library from a species with a genome that is closely related to the target genome in the DNA sample. Diversification of present-day non-African populations and anatomically modern humans By now many studies in different fields have led to the conclusion that present-day non-African population is the result of the diversification in several different lineages of an ancestral, well- structured, metapopulation which was the protagonist of an out-of-Africa expansion, in which it carried a subset of African genetic heritage. In this context, the analysis of ancient DNA was fundamental to test already formulated hypothesis and to provide new insights. First, it has allowed to narrow the timing and the structure of this diversification phenomenon by providing the calibration of the autosomal and mitochondrial mutation rate.Skoglund P. and Mathieson I. 2018. Ancient genomics of modern humans: the first decade. Annu. Rev. Genom. Hum. Genet. 19:1, 381-404. Admixture analysis has demonstrated that at least two independent gene flow events have occurred between ancestors of modern humans and archaic humans, such as Neanderthal and Denisovan populations, testifying the ‚Äúleaky replacement‚Äù model of Eurasian human population history. According to all these data, the human divergence of the non-African lineages occurred around 45,000 ‚Äì 55,000 BP. Besides that, in many cases ancient DNA has allowed to track historical processes which have led, in time, to the actual population genetic structure, which would have been difficult to do counting only on the analysis of present-day genomes. Among these still unresolved questions, some of the most studied are the identity of the first inhabitants of the Americas, the peopling of Europe and the origin of agriculture in Europe.Lan T. and Lindqvist C. 2018. Paleogenomics: Genome-Scale Analysis of Ancient DNA and Population and Evolutionary Genomic Inferences. In: Population Genomics, Springer, Cham. pp 1-38.  Phenotypic variation in humans Analysis of ancient DNA allows to study mutations of phenotypic traits following changes in environment and human behavior. Migration to new habitats, new dietary shifts (following the transition to agriculture) and building of large communities led to the exposure of humans to new conditions that ultimately resulted in biological adaptation. = Skin colour = Migration of humans out of Africa to higher latitudes involved less exposure to sunlight. Since UVA and UVB rays are crucial for the synthesis of vitamin D, which regulates calcium absorption and thus is essential for bone health, living at higher latitudes would mean a substantial reduction in vitamin D synthesis. This put a new selective pressure on skin colour trait, favouring lighter skin colour at higher latitudes. The two most important genes involved in skin pigmentation are SLC24A5 and SLC45A2. Nowadays the ‚Äúlight skin‚Äù alleles of these genes are fixed in Europe but they reached a relatively high frequency only fairly recently (about 5000 years ago). Such slow depigmentation process suggests that ancient Europeans could have faced the downsides of low vitamin D production, such as musculoskeletal and cardiovascular conditions. Another hypothesis is that pre-agricultural Europeans could have met their vitamin D requirements through their diet (since meat and fish contain some vitamin D)Marciniak S., Perry G. H. Harnessing ancient genomes to study the history of human adaptation. Nature Reviews Genetics volume 18, pages 659‚Äì674 (2017) = Adaptation to agricultural diet = One of the major examples of adaptation following the switch to agricultural diet is the persistence of production of the lactase enzyme in adulthood. This enzyme is essential to digest lactose present in milk and dietary products and its absence leads to diarrhea following the consumption of these products. Lactase persistence is determined predominantly by a single-base mutation in the MCM6 gene and ancient DNA data show that this mutation became common only within the past 5000 years, thousands of years after the beginning of dairying practices. Thus, even in the case of lactase-persistence there is a huge time delay between the onset of a new habit and the spread of the adaptive allele and so milk consumption may have been restricted to children or to lactose-reduced products. Another example of mutation positively selected by the switch to agriculture is the number of AMY1 gene copies. AMY1 encodes for the starch-digesting enzyme amylase present in saliva and modern humans have a higher number of gene copies compared to chimpanzees. = The immune system = The human immune system has undergone intense selection through the millennia, adapting to different pathogen landscapes. Several environmental and cultural changes have imposed a selective pressure on different immune-associated genes. Migrations, for example, exposed humans to new habitats carrying new pathogens or pathogen vectors (e.g. mosquitos). Also the switch to agriculture involved exposition to different pathogens and health conditions, both due to the increased population density and to living close to livestock. However, it is difficult to directly correlate particular ancient genome changes to improved resistance to particular pathogens, giving the vastness and complexity of the human immune system. Besides studying directly changes in the human immune system, it is also possible to study the ancient genomes of pathogens, such as those causing tuberculosis, leprosy, plague, smallpox or malaria. For example, researchers have discovered that all strains of Yersinia pestis before 3600 years ago were lacking the ymt gene, which is essential for the pathogen to survive in the intestine of fleas. This suggests that in the ancient past plague may had been less virulent compared to more recent Y. pestis outbreaks.  Plants and animals  Many non-hominin vertebrates - ancient mammoth, polar bear, dog and horse - have been reconstructed through aDNA recovery from fossils and samples preserved at low temperature or high altitude. Mammoth studies are most frequent due to the high presence of soft tissue and hair from permafrost and are used to identify the relationship and demographic changes with more recent elephants. Polar bear studies are performed to identify the impact of climate change in evolution and biodiversity. Dog and horse studies give insights into domestication. In plants, aDNA has been isolated from seeds, pollen and wood. A correlation has been identified between ancient and extant barley. Another application was the detection of domestication and adaptation process of maize which include genes for drought tolerance and sugar content. Challenges and future perspectives The analysis of ancient genomes of anatomically modern humans has, in recent years, completely revolutionized our way of studying population migrations, transformation and evolution. Nevertheless, much still remains unknown. The first and obvious problem related to this kind of approach, which is going to be partially overcome by the continuous improvement of the ancient DNA extraction techniques, is the difficulty of recovering well preserved ancient genomes, a challenge that is particularly observed in Africa and in Asia, where the temperatures are higher than in other colder regions of the world. Further, Africa is, among all the continents, the one that harbors the most genetic diversity. Besides DNA degradation, also exogenous contamination limits paleogenomic sequencing and assembly processes. As we do not possess ancient DNA coming from the time and the region inhabited by the original ancestors of present-day non-African population, we still know little about their structure and location. The second and more important challenge that this matter has to face is the recovery of DNA from early modern humans (100,000 ‚Äì 200,000 BP). These data, together with a major number of archaic genomes to analyze and with the knowledge of the timing and of the distribution of archaic genetic admixture, will allow scientists to more easily reconstruct the history of our species. In fact, collecting more data about or genetic history will allow us to track human evolution not only in terms of migrations and natural selection, but also in terms of culture. In the next decade paleogenomics research field is going to focus its attention mainly on three topics: the definition, at a fine-scale detail, of past human interactions by denser sampling, the comprehension of how these interactions have contributed to agricultural transition by analysis of DNA of understudied regions and, finally, the quantification of the natural selection contribution to present-day phenotypes. To interpret all these data geneticists will be required to cooperate, as they have already done with anthropologists and archaeologists, with historians.  Bioethics  Bioethics in paleogenomics concerns ethical questions that arise in the study of ancient human remains, due to the complex relationships among scientists, governments and indigenous populations. In addition, paleogenomic studies have the potential to harm community or individual histories and identities, as well as to reveal denouncing information about their descendants. For these reasons, these kind of studies is still a touchy subject. Paleogenomics studies can have negative consequences mainly because of the discrepancies between articulations of ethical principles and practices. In fact, ancestors‚Äô remains are usually considered legally and scientifically as ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù, rather than ‚Äúhuman subjects‚Äù, which justifies questionable behaviors and lack of engagement from communities. Testing of ancestral remains are therefore used in disputes, claims in treaty, repatriation, or other legal cases. The acknowledgement of the importance and susceptibility of this subject is heading towards ethical commitment and guidance applicable to different contexts, in order to preserve ancestral remains‚Äô dignity and avoid ethical issues.Advancing the ethics of paleogenomics: Ancestral remains should not be regarded as \\"artifacts\\" but as human relatives who eserve respect - Jessica Bardill, Alyssa C. Bader, Nanibaa' A. Garrison, Deborah A. Bolnick, Jennifer A. Raff, Alexa Walker, Ripan S. Malhi, and the Summer Internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics (SING) Consortium Finally, another pioneering area of interest is the so- called ‚Äúde-extinction‚Äù project, which aims to the resurrection of extinct species, such as the mammoth. This project, which appears to be possible thanks to the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, is, however, strongly connected to many ethical issues.

The house was probably built in 1847 and it replaced a single storey brick dwelling which was on the site in 1845. Originally intended as a town house, Lilyvale seems to have quickly assumed the role of a tavern and a boarding house. In 1885 it was known as Cumberland Hotel and in the following years was known as Clare Tavern and Athol Blair. The origin of the name Lilyvale is unknown, but was in use when the property was surveyed in 1928. The architectural style of Lilyvale reflects the introduction in New South Wales of the 1837 Building Act by Legislative Council, and a subsequent Act of 1845 intended to clarify the earlier Act. The legislation, aimed primarily at fire prevention, was based on the London Building Act on 1709 and effectively put an end to the Colonial style compatible with the legislation. The resulting architecture was similar to the style of London architecture of the early 19th century, although perhaps more austere. Lilyvale forms an important link in domestic, town architecture between the Colonial Regency and the Victorian Italianate styles.  Description  Lilyvale Cottage is a three-storey double fronted brick residence, erected . Lilyvale is a fine, free standing example of the Colonial Regency style. This style is derived from the parapet on the first floor front elevation, which partially obscures the roof and the formal, symmetrical arrangement of openings. The cottage is an unusual example of the Regency style, being adorned with a verandah at ground floor level and a prominent gabled roof which contains attic rooms rising above the front elevation. Construction is of traditional load bearing brickwork with timber framed floors and roof. Attic rooms are lit by three dormer windows facing to the rear. Internally, it comprises a central corridor with front and back rooms opening on each side. The hallway leads to the original cedar staircase, giving access to upper level rooms and to the rear yard. The stairway continues to the attic. Early cedar joinery, fireplaces, doors windows and plasterwork survive in most rooms.Schwager Brooks 1989: 5-6 Style: Colonial Regency; Storeys: Three; Facade: Brick; Side Rear Walls: Brick; Internal Walls: Brick & timber framed; Internal Structure: Timber; Floor Frame: Timber; Roof Frame: Timber shingle; Ceilings: Original lath and plaster, ceiling roses and cornices.; Stairs: Timber (original); Lifts: None = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Area under building only. Terraced into hill slope. Investigation: Excavation. Archaeology partly disturbed. = Modifications and dates = Alterations made earlier this century to the front verandah. The turned timber columns were cut short from their base to incorporate a new brick fence to Cumberland Street. The building appears to have altered little from the original form. Restoration in 1987 by SCRA included recovering the roof in timber shingles, replacement of chimney pots, window and door shutters and general internal refurbishment. In addition a new toilet enclosure was created in the rear room and an internal access created from this wing to the main house. The majority of external render was removed and the brick walls painted.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, Lilyvale and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Lilyvale Cottage is a very fine and rare example of Colonial Regency freestanding domestic architecture in the city centre. It is in good condition, having been conserved in 1987 by SCRA, and retains much of its early form and materials. The cottage is an integral component of a group of 19th century houses in this section of Cumberland Street, which evokes a traditional Rocks streetscape. Lilyvale (176 Cumberland Street), the Butchery Building (178-180 Cumberland Street) & Hart's Building (10-14 Essex Street) as a group: The surviving buildings occupying the block bounded by Cumberland, Essex and Gloucester Streets, south of the Cahill Expressway, collectively illustrate the range and diversity of small scale development in this area of The Rocks between 1840 and World War I. They combine with nearby precincts to the south of Essex Street to extend that diversity into the early decades of the 20th century. The buildings on the site combine to form an interesting group, reminiscent of the lively and diverse early streetscapes and urban scale of The Rocks.Schwager Brooks 1989: 71 Lilyvale was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria.

He entered his father's business in 1795. James, with his brother Robert (1795‚Äì1864), who became a partner in the business in 1819, took out several patents for improvements in ploughs. Threshing machines, scarifiers, and other agricultural implements were also improved by the firm. James and Robert Ransome were among the earliest members of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, which was founded in 1838, and they gained in later years many of the society's chief medals and prizes. On the coming of railways, the Ransomes became the largest manufacturers of railway chairs, a patent being obtained for casting them. A patent was also taken out for compressed wood keys and treenails for securing the chairs and rails, and many millions of these were produced. James Ransome died at Rushmere, Ipswich, on 22 November 1849, his wife Hannah, daughter of Samuel Hunton of Southwold, having predeceased him on 8 December 1826.

Soon after the war ended, the Brooklyn headed to Vladivostok, Russia to support the American Expeditionary Force, Siberia. On a document he filed with the Navy, Mecklem stated that he served in Vladivostok for \\"about 7 months in the harbor about 2 months of which were shore duty.\\" After leaving the Navy, Mecklem then moved to New York City and studied at the Art Students League with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Boardman Robinson.

Austin and Hannah traveled to Europe in 1929, and resided in New York City for a time. Hannah Small became romantically involved with the painter Eugene Ludins, and eventually Small and Mecklem divorced, after which Small married Ludins. Mecklem married Marianne Appel in 1937. They lived at the Maverick colony in Woodstock in a cabin. Mecklem died on Oct. 7, 1951. Austin and Marianne had two children, Sarah Greer Mecklem and Margaret Merrill Mecklem.

It was designed by Michael Gannon and built from 1839 to 1840 by Michael Gannon as residential houses and stables. It is also known as Michael Gannon's House. As at 2019, it contains an Gannon House Gallery (an art gallery) and La Renaissance Patisserie (a cafe). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site had originally been part of the Hospital grounds, as part of the Assistant Surgeons residence and garden. When the hospital moved to Macquarie Street the site and residence was occupied by Francis Greenway as part of his salary as colonial architect under Governor Macquarie. When he was dismissed in 1822 he claimed that the residence and land had been promised to him by Macquarie. It appears even though the Government tried to repossess the site Greenway remained there until . The subject site lays just to the east of the residence. Land title documents indicate that an allotment of land bounded by Argyle and Harrington Streets, Harrington Lane and Greenway's residence was leased by Governor Brisbane in 1823 to John Gleeson, a labourer for a period of twenty one years. By 1826 the lease was apparently conveyed to Thomas Ryan, however no record of the transfer has been located. In 1830 William Reynolds apparently purchased part of the land from Ryan for ¬£100 and in the same year the subdivided land on the corner of Argyle and Harrington Streets was sold by Ryan to Frederick Wright Unwin. Unwin leased part of the site and building that occupied it, a stone tenement and boarding house to Caleb Slater who conducted a public house called the Kings Head. When City Section 84 was drawn up in 1834 most of the land between Harrington and George Streets on the southern side of Argyle Street was claimed by Francis Greenway. Greenway was unable to prove his title to the land and it was sold to Unwin for by the Colonial government. By 1840, only a few years after the sale, hotels stood on both the Harrington and George Street corners of the block. In 1839 he leased about two thirds of his allotment to Michael Gannon for 21 years for a ground rent of per year. The lease required that Gannon build and erect on the line of frontage to George Street within two years as many houses that could occupy the frontage, three storeys exclusive of cellars and built of \\"substantially of good materials\\". In accordance with the lease Gannon built on the Argyle Street part of the allotment very quickly and he had constructed the New York Hotel on the corner of Argyle and George Streets which opened in February 1841. The two houses on the subject site in Argyle Street were built by Gannon from 1839-1840. Gannon's workshops (builder, manufacturer of coffins) and timber yard occupied the rear of the premises, as did a number of other tenants. Gannon was bankrupted in the 1840s depression and his estate seized in 1845, and besides personal possessions everything including household furniture was sold to pay off his creditors at auction. The family left the Argyle Street property in late 1845 and settled permanently on the Cooks River. J. S. Hanson appears to have the leasehold on the two houses until 1860 when the original 21-year lease expired. The 1858 Trig survey shows that little had changed on the site since Gannon left the properties. The buildings were used for both residential and commercial used. In 1858 No. 45 was a boarding house and No. 47 housed a bootmaker. The 1865 Trig survey indicates that the workshops and stables constructed by Gannon had been demolished, the residence expanded with the construction of a rear wing and outbuilding and a number of sheds are attached to the eastern wall. The shingle roof had been replaced with corrugated iron by this time. The buildings were purchased by William Yeoman in July 1870, he occupied part of the site with his business. In July 1885 John Gill, a pastoralist from Moonbi, purchased the buildings and land. He had it surveyed and measured to ensure the description on the deeds was accurate. Gill died in 1889 but the properties remained with his trustees until the site was resumed after the plague broke out in 1900. The Crown formally acquired the site in 1903. The Rocks area was administered by the Government from that time, beginning with the Sydney Harbour Trust, then the Maritime Services Board. 45-47 Argyle Street are absolutely typical of the smaller, less pretentious but still ambitious development taking place in Sydney and The Rocks of the 1840s. Comparison with like buildings of the period is getting more difficult as they have become rarer, but \\"lesser quality\\" residential buildings such as Susannah Place (1844) and more substantial houses of Argyle Place put Nos. 45-47 in context. The building's location and changing uses in The Rocks provide further evidence of the historical development of the area, across the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, in terms of its changing fabric, and the changes in its function as firstly the centre, and later an adjunct, of the City of Sydney itself. Its survival retains the presence of the earliest consolidation of the area, its later more intense development in the mid- Nineteenth century, through government acquisition for \\"slum management\\" in 1903. The buildings have the great ability to reveal information about themselves and their construction, and archaeologically important in this regard.Moore, 1992 The site's archaeological history is that it was part of the Hospital garden between 1795 and 1816.See also: AR038-039; AR045; AR057; AR061-070; AR073-074; AR078-079; AR084-085; AR126; AR129; AR131-132; AR149 Francis Greenway was in occupation of the site from 1815.AR057; AR062; AR078 The site was granted to Frederick Wright Unwin on 15 December 1838.AM064; AM119-120; AM161; AR062; AR078  Description  The buildings comprise a two- storey structure, comprising a wide U-shape with the base towards Argyle Street, and are effectively one structure and form, identified as such by the shopfront of No. 47 and the windows either side of the centrally placed doorway of No. 45. This integrated construction is consistent with a low-cost development of the property. A low parapet with box gutter behind conceals the main hipped roof parallel to the street, which returns over the rear of No. 45, while that of No. 47 is covered by skillion roofs The rear wings enclose a courtyard. The ground floor is of stone and the first floor of brick construction with stud internal walls with lathe and plaster linings, all of which suggest a cost-conscious approach. While No. 45 is extremely intact both externally and internally in form and layout, the fabric detail of No. 47 is consistent with a major reconstruction of the rear wing in the late 19th century. Though adaptation of service rooms on each floor has taken place, the majority of rooms remain in their original format, with much of their original detail fabric quite intact, if covered by layers of subsequent paint decoration. The combination and juxtaposition of materials and their use is of great interest in understanding buildings of this type. Style: Colonial Georgian; Storeys: No. 45two floors with seven rooms; No. 47two floors with three rooms; Internal walls: Lathe and plaster linings; Roof cladding: Galvanised iron and galvanised steel sheet, fixed over extensive remnants of the original timber shingle roof; Internal structure: Timber-frame; Floor frame: Ground floor stone - first floor brick construction; Roof frame: Shingled. Archaeology notes: . Two-storey buildings. Vestiges of another building along western wall of courtyard; Built by: s. = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, the archaeological condition was assessed as partly disturbed. Assessment basis: Cellar under part of No. 45. Rear courtyard terraced into slope. Archaeology partly disturbed, however potential resources remain in rear yards and underfloor deposits. The archaeological resource on the footpath to Argyle Street disturbed to below footpath surface. An archaeological monitoring program was completed in November 2007. = Modifications and dates = A trigonometrical survey of 1858 showed the buildings in similar configuration though walls of the outbuildings differed from the 1844 plan. A small addition had been made at the south-east corner of Gannon's own building (No. 45). By 1865, the workshop and stable built by Gannon has been removed, and additional outbuildings and rooms had been added at the rear of both buildings. According to a photograph, the main change appears to have been that the shingle roof had been replaced by a new roof of corrugated iron. Multiple-paned glass sashes were situated in all the window openings. The ground floor windows were protected by shutters.  Heritage listing  As at 22 January 2009, Gannon House and Shop and site are of State heritage significance for their historical, aesthetic and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their associations with the early development of the precinct and contribution to The Rocks area and local personalities such as Greenway, Unwin and Gannon. The buildings provide important evidence of the architecture, building practices and economy of the late 1830s and 1840s. No. 45 in particular is significant as a largely intact and complete example of a residence from that period. Nos. 45-47 Argyle Street is a rare example of dwelling with attached \\"office/shop\\" which demonstrates the social and economic climate of the area at this time. The changes to the shopfront and rear of No. 47 represent the changing requirements and development of the commercial use of the building which is also reflective of the changes in the precinct and local area. Gannon House and Shop are prominent elements in the eastern section of Argyle Street primarily due to their modest scale and location surrounded by larger, more elaborately detailed buildings. They are the only survivors from the 1840s development on the south eastern section of Argyle Street and make a positive contribution to varied character and historical nature of the precinct. Gannon House & Shop was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site is historically significant as part of the first hospital and site of the surgeon's residence and garden. From 1816, on relocation of the hospital to Macquarie Street, it became part of a contested and sought after address and valuable piece of real estate in what was fast becoming the commercial heart of Sydney. The site was a part of a larger land holding developed by F. W. Unwin by lease arrangement with local builder Michael Gannon form 1839, who as attracted to the site's prime location, close to the centre of mercantile and shipping activities. The buildings were constructed as a dwelling with workshops and stables at the rear and attached \\"dwelling or office\\" in recognition of this prominent address, growth and development of the area and also demonstrated the building practices of the time and economy of the situation. Gannon constructed a number of \\"speculative\\" buildings on the land in the same sound, simple and contemporary style. The buildings continued to be used for both residential and commercial purposes will into the 20th century and are historically significant as they demonstrate local life from the time of their construction and later evolution of the local area and shift from mixed use to solely commercial use, by the adaptation of both Nos. 45 and 46 and additions to the rear of No. 47. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site is part of land associated with Francis Greenway, the first Colonial Architect, who was unable to prove his ownership of the land and forced to relinquish his claim. It was subsequently purchased by F. W. Unwin, prominent businessman, who was responsible for the development of the Argyle Stores complex among other business ventures in the colony. The site was leased to and developed by Michael Gannon, a recognised local builder and developer. The buildings were constructed by Gannon in 1839-40 as part of the lease agreement with Unwin and served as his workplace and residence until 1845. The site and buildings were subsequently associated with a number of local identities and land owners until 1900, when they were resumed and vested with the Sydney Harbour Trust. The buildings have since been associated with Maritime Services Board, Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority and Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority who have all managed the use and maintenance of the site and buildings and surrounding area. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Gannon House and Shop is a rare surviving example of a single dwelling with attached shop that demonstrates the early 19th century construction techniques, finishes and economy. The building illustrates simple Georgian style with little ornamentation and incorporates standard techniques and finishes with reflects the \\"speculative\\" nature of the overall development. The form of the buildings, construction to the street frontage, lack of garden and incorporation of the \\"office/shop\\" represents recognition of the prime address and a shift in the style of residential accommodation during this period as the land in the area became more developed and densely populated. Gannon House and Shop are prominent elements in the eastern section of Argyle Street primarily due to their modest scale and location surrounded by larger, more elaborately detailed buildings. They are the only survivors from 1840s development on the south eastern section of Argyle Street and make a positive contribution to varied character and historical nature of the precinct. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Gannon House and Shop has been part of a busy and active precinct since 1840 and is associated with a number of owner-occupiers and tenants who were part of a closely knit working-class neighbourhood. The alterations and adaptations of the buildings, particularly to No. 47, represents to the ongoing commercial use of the buildings and development of the area. The building remains part of an active commercial \\"community\\" and is now also part of a busy tourist precinct and can be interpreted as part of the historic fabric of the area. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Gannon House, No. 45 Argyle Street is largely intact and as such demonstrates the architecture of the late 1830s and 1840s and domestic standards, spatial requirements and way of life and attitudes of its occupants from this time. The finishes and fabric of the building provides a valuable resource and reference to the type of interior decorations common to working-class houses. The attached \\"dwelling or office\\" and shop No. 47 Argyle St, also demonstrated the growth and development of the area as a changing commercial centre. The successive additions and alterations demonstrate the changing requirements and evolution of the area into a tourist precinct. The changes to the surrounding area and rear site boundaries also demonstrate changes land ownership and development of the area. The rear courtyard behind the buildings and neighbouring properties contain a unique resource for interpretation of these changes. Whilst partly disturbed, archaeological resources relating to the 1839-40s development of the site remain below the courtyard paving. Evidence relating to the earlier use and fabric of the building also significantly remains in the basement, walls and roof cavities. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Gannon House and Shop is a rare surviving example of a single dwelling with attached shop constructed in 1839-40 and only surviving part of the grouping of buildings constructed by Gannon and the area bounded by George, Harrington and Argyle Streets. The other buildings have been demolished or redeveloped. No. 45 Argyle Street in particular generally retains its original form and internal layout. There are a number of dwellings and terraces dating from the same period remaining, however, these vary in scale and detail and do not have the some relationship between dwelling and shop. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Gannon House and Shop is important as it demonstrates the growth and in particular the commercial development of the local area. The building form and use was influenced by its vicinity to what was the centre of mercantile and shipping activities in the colony with more recent adaptation of the building influence by its role in an active historic precinct and tourist destination.

In the general election, she defeated incumbent Republican John Rafferty - who had represented the 44th District since 2003 - by a margin of 62,692 to 57,943 (52% to 48%). Her victory was part of the \\"blue wave\\" that increased Democratic and female representation in the Pennsylvania General Assembly and Congressional delegation. Her candidacy was considered a long- shot in many political circles, but her well known tenacity and hard-work (Muth and her army of volunteers knocked on well over 100,000 doors over the course of 11 months), coupled with the fact that she was a working-class candidate and an outsider of the Democratic party establishment won over voters of all political parties as she went on to win what was considered one of the most shocking victories in recent Pennsylvania election history.

Throughout her reading, Republican Majority Leader Jake Corman of Bellefonte loudly raised a point of order which was not recognized by the president (Democratic Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman). The Republican-controlled Senate voted against renewing the program 26‚Äì24. The video of the confrontation became popular and Muth was acknowledged on Twitter by Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren, recalling a similar incident in Warren's career.  2020 Presidential Endorsement  On November 8, 2019 Muth tweeted her official endorsement of Senator Elizabeth Warren in her bid for President. Standing up for veterans at the Southeastern Veterans Center During a 4 month period beginning in March 2020, Senator Muth fielded dozens of calls from family members, loved ones and staff from the Southeastern Veterans Center (one of six state owned veteran retirement homes in PA) located in East Vincent Township. Residents and their family members had no idea how many people were dying at the four-story veterans‚Äô home near the Schuylkill River when the Philadelphia Inquirer broke a story on April 25. The news was stunning: 26 residents had died in what had clearly become one of the deadliest coronavirus outbreaks in the state. Muth challenged the results of an \\"independent\\" investigation in which the state found no wrong doings at the center. In late May 2020, the governor‚Äôs Office of General Counsel engaged outside counsel to conduct an independent investigation of the outbreak at the center and the way the home and the state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs addressed the crisis. No details have been released. Muth stated, \\"I blame a state system that is internally regulated with no guarantee of transparency, from the doctors and the director at the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs to the inspectors and the secretary at the Department of the Health.\\" Muth continued to push for answers and later called on Attorney General Josh Shapiro to investigate the Center.

During his lifetime he gained wide popularity as author of 4 novels; currently classified as political fiction or dystopian prose, they are considered second-rate literature. His best known work La Rep√∫blica espa√±ola en 1.91... (1911) fairly accurately predicted the advent of the Republic, its sectarian politics, collapse of public order and the ensuing military coup. As a journalist Cirici contributed to some 30 Conservative and Catholic dailies, but is best known as editor-in-chief of El Correo Espa√±ol and briefly the key author of El Debate. Politically Cirici remained a Carlist; he advanced the Traditionalist outlook both in his novels and in his press work, though he did not hold any post in the party and his attempts to obtain a seat in the Cortes ended in failure. Family and youth Terrassa, around 1901 There is little known about paternal ascendants of Cirici Ventall√≥; the Cirici family has not been recorded until the 19th century, when some of its representatives were noted in Northern Catalonia. The father of Domingo, Mat√≠as Cirici Traverhis exact segundo apellido is not clear. In two obituaries, probably published by his son, he is noted as \\"Traver\\", compare La Cruz 10.07.12, available here, and El Correo Espanol 09.07.12, available here. The biographer of Cirici Ventallo claims that the correct spelling is \\"Trav√©\\", √Ängels Carles-Pomar, Domingo Cirici Ventall√≥: un periodista terrassenc a Madrid, Terrassa 2007, , p. 31. She also advances a catalanised version of his name, \\"Matias Cirici i Trav√©\\", which he was unlikely to use; if so, he would have used \\"Mat√≠as Cirici y Trav√©\\" (1837‚Äì1912),his date of death is clear, see e.g. El Correo Espanol 09.07.12, available here. His date of birth is subject to doubt. A newspaper obituary claims he died \\"at the age of 77\\", which might point to 1835 though also 1834 or 1836, see La Cruz 10.07.12, available here.

Fantas√≠a fantas√≠a de costumbres pol√≠ticas contempor√°neas Both books were political pamphlets aimed against the Left and featured Spain of the near future. The monarchy was toppled and replaced with a republic, ran by a republican-socialist coalition; it declared agrarian reform and official atheism, banning public Catholic cult; as growing chaos and separatism produced collapse of public order, a rebellious general staged a coup intended to save the country. The narratives featured numerous real life personalities, usually set in sinister roles of cynical political manipulators:Rafael Perez de la Dehesa, La novela ut√≥pica en Espa√±a, [in:] Actas del Cuarto Congreso de la Asociaci√≥n Internacional de Hispanistas, Salamanca 1982, pp. 409‚Äì410 Lerroux, Alvarez, Gald√≥s, Largo Caballero, Weyler, Iglesias, Romanones, Azc√°rate, Alcal√°-Zamora, Besteiro and many others, though the rebel general was a fictitious person.the general who led a coup, declared as intended to save the republic, was named Casero. None of the sources consulted indicates whether the character was modelled on any real-life person A few episodes might have seemed off-limits, e.g. Gald√≥s as president of the republic was killed in an assassination attempt.Lieve Behiels, Gald√≥s y el pensamiento ut√≥pico, [in:] Yolanda Arencibia Santana (ed.), Memoria del X Congreso Internacional de Estudios Galdosianos, s.l. 2005, , p 28 Following commercial success of especially Rep√∫blica Cirici adhered to the same genre of political fictionin 1913 he published also collection of short pieces, titled S√°tiras pol√≠ticas when in 1914 he published El secreto de lord Kitchener.full title El secreto de lord Kitchener. Fantas√≠a sobre la Guerra Europea Again a voice in heated public discourse, the novel formed part of ongoing propaganda war about the role of Spain in the unfolding European conflict. It advanced a vehemently pro-German and anti-British outlook; the novel was formatted as a series of rather loosely related stand-alone chapters, each telling its own story. The narrative followed the future course of the war and ended with total defeat of the Entente; France was overrun, Britain lost almost all its overseas possessions, Germany obtained sort of Gibraltar in Kent and became the unchallenged European might, federated with Belgium and Poland.the plot is referred in detail in Uribe 1999 Among many real-life personalities, also the foreign ones, again Liberal and Republican Spanish politicians were portrayed as lousy, mischievous failures; Kitchener was killed by an outraged suffragette.the title secret of Kitchener is extremely powerful explosive powder, invented by a Spanish scientist and offered to the British The novel was a success;the second edition soon followed; it was re-titled to El secreto de lord Kitchener y el desastre de Inglaterra, Mar√≠a Dolores Romero L√≥pez, Inventos y artilugios de ciencia ficci√≥n en la literatura de la edad de plata: de la fe en el progresso al desencanto [MA thesis Complutense 2015], p. 20 moreover, it was promptly translated into German and Swedish.in German the book appeared as Kitcheners Geheimnis: Heiteres √ºber d. Weltkrieg (Leipzig 1915), and in Swedish as Kitcheners hemlighet: en fantasi om v√§rldskriget (Stockholm 1915), √Ängels Carles-Pomar, Juntes militars versus Juntes de Defensa. Militarisme a Espanya i Portugal al final de la Gran Guerra [PhD thesis Universitat Pompeu Fabra], Barcelona 2011, p. 333, available here cover of La tragedia del diputado Anfr√∫ns La tragedia del diputado Anfr√∫nsfull title La tragedia del diputado Anfr√∫ns. Novela de costumbres pol√≠ticas contempor√°neas was first serialized in El Debate from January to May 1917, later that year released also as a book. Cirici remained within the limits of militant political fiction, though this time the plot was set not in the future but in the recent past. The novel focused on Catalonia; Cirici's venom was intended, apart from his usual liberal-republican enemies, also for the Catalanists, all indulging in corruption and caciquismo.when writing the book Cirici was heavily banking on his former record of a press reporter serving in the Cortes. Politics is presented as behind-the-scenes shady deals of corrupted cynical cronies, who interface with equally immoral editors and businessmen, all pursuing their own swindles. The novel presents only left- wing politicians; the Conservatives or the Carlists are absent in the narrative The novel tells the story of a young Liberal political hopeful. His cynicism and wit earn him first a place in the Barcelona ayuntamiento and then in the Cortes, let alone millions of a cleverly married girl from a Mexico- based indiano family. However, he is eventually outsmarted by equally cynical collaborators and malicious wife; Anfr√∫ns dies when involved in half-legal war supplies to the French army. Like in Memorias the key protagonist was a fictitious character interfacing mostly with real-life personalities; apart from the customary black characters of Lerroux or Romanones,Cirici developed also a particular animosity towards Sagasta, Carles-Pomar 2000, p. 29. However, Sagasta does not appear as a character in his novels, even though his bust is witness to most outrageous swindles agreed by other characters pictured this time they included many Catalans like Comas y Masferrer, Camb√≥ and Planas y Casals.the protagonist is Manuel Anfruns, a lad from a decent family. As vice-president of Juventud Liberal he edits the local party daily and with money from his Mexican fianc√© buys himself a place in the Barcelona ayuntamiento. He then outmanouvres a fellow party colleague to obtain the Cortes ticket and gets married, though he knows his millionaire bride had amorous episodes back in America. Considered an expert economist, he is applauded by Unamuno and Romanones. Banking on his political connections Anfr√∫ns launches shady businesses, including a daily and a trading house. His partners outsmart him and his political cronies abandon him when in need; though twice re-elected he gets into trouble. Anfr√∫ns assaults his former partner on the street and is challenged to a duel. He intends to avoid it but is forced to accept and gets severely wounded. His bank is bankrupt and the casino he sets up is plundered by a smart gambler. He then engages in supply of horses and mules to the French army, but the corrupted French block the deal. Anfruns dies; his former cronies rob his belongings and in display of hypocrisy erect a monument to him, though after some time it is removed to suburbian location, pelted with stones by local boys. Interestingly, there are some similarities between Anfruns and Cirici: medicine-related family, early marriage, editorial work and intention to avoid a duel, see La Naci√≥n 16.12.16, available here Carlist Carlist standard Cirici Ventall√≥ descended from the Carlist family and acquired the Traditionalist outlook from his paternal ancestors,La Epoca 09.12.17, available here. Matias Cirici was listed as involved in Traditionalist initiatives, see El Pensamiento Espa√±ol 11.07.65, available here. In 1883 the press noted a bomb attempt against his house in Terrassa; no further details are known yet it might have been related to his Carlist stand, La Discusi√≥n 24.10.83, available here. Moreover, his brother Bartolomeo was member of Junta Catolico-Monarquica in Seu d'Urgell, while another brother Andres served as parish priest in Aja and was author or religious booklets, Camino de la virtud y reglamento de vida para una familia cristina (Barcelona, 1875) and Novenario de discursos dogm√°ticos sobre los asuntos que hoy d√≠a m√°s conviene tocar en una parr√≥quia (Barcelone, 1892), Carles-Pomar 2007, p. 31 and perhaps also maternal relatives.his step-uncle, Narciso Ventall√≥ Homs, was a Carlist His press career is from the onset marked by militant Carlist zeal, demonstrated in the 1900s in periodicals like La Dinast√≠a,La Dinast√≠a 24.10.99, available here El Correo Catalan or La Veu.La Epoca 09.12.17, available here He was soon noticed by party pundits and offered to join El Correo Espa√±ol.El Correo Espa√±ol 10.12.17, available here Cirici soon became one of the key contributors to the daily, pursuing the legitimist cause also in other party-related papers like El Norte;see e.g. El Norte 09.07.12, available here La Independencia,see e.g. La Independencia 23.08.15, available here El Restaurador,see e.g. El Restaurador 18.07.12, available here or La Tradici√≥n.when discussing the role of Cirici scholars underline that the new Carlist executive considered modern propaganda key to the party bid for power, \\"El paper que des de la c√∫pula carlina s‚Äôatorga a la premsa √©s fonamental: es considera que ha de ser el principal referent per a poder dotar el partit d‚Äôunitat d‚Äôacci√≥ i conduir-lo cap a la modernitzaci√≥ necess√†ria perqu√® continu√Ø essent una opci√≥ pol√≠tica v√†lida per a molts ciutadans de l‚ÄôEstat\\", Enric Sanlleh√≠ i Bitri√†, CARLES I POMAR, √Ängels.

Historia de una ambici√≥n pol√≠tica, Madrid 2000, The following year he published La Peregrinaci√≥n de la Lealtad and Biograf√≠a de don Jaime de Borb√≥n, the former a set of essays organized around the Carlist rally in Lourdes and the latter the biography of the claimant. Finally, in 1916 he contributed to a massive bibliographic review of Carlist press.Domingo Cirici Ventall√≥, Intermedio, [in:] Jos√© Navarro Cabanes, Apuntes Bibliogr√°ficos de la Prensa Carlista, Valencia 1916, pp. 124‚Äì127 Juan Vazquez de Mella Cirici a few times unsuccessfully tried to launch a strictly political career. In 1910 he was reported to compete for seat in the Cortes on the Carlist ticket from Valderrobres in Arag√≥n;El Imparcial 04.02.10, available here none of the sources consulted confirms that he indeed ran. In 1914 he did stand as a candidate from Vilademuls;initially he was supposed to run in Torroella de Montgr√≠, Carles-Pomar 2000, p. 26 having gained 1749 votes (28% of the total) he decisively lost to a Liberal counter-candidate.Albert Balcells, Joan B. Culla, Conxita Mir, Les eleccions generals a Catalunya de 1901 a 1923, Barcelona 1982, , p. 548 In 1916 Cirici renewed his bid, this time as a joint Carlist-Maurist contender from Les Borges; with 1667 votes (20%) he was defeated by Francesc Mac√≠a.Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, p. 561 His candidacy, apparently enforced by the national party executive, caused a minor turmoil in the provincial Lerida jefatura, which objected to both a cuckoo candidate and to the alliance strategy.Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, pp. 198, 222 Cirici's political activity fell on a period marked by growing paralysis of Carlism, torn by conflict between Vazqu√©z de Mella and Don Jaime; it very much focused on control of El Correo Espa√±ol. It is not entirely clear what was the option followed by Cirici. On the one hand, he was brought to the editorial board by de Mella. On the other hand, in 1913 Don Jaime favored him for the post of editor-in-chief against the candidacy of Miguel Pe√±aflor, advanced and eventually successfully secured by de Mella.Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 80 None of the sources consulted notes Cirici as involved in the power struggle within the party and in the mid-1910s Pe√±aflor and Cirici went together well.see e.g. an obituary by Pe√±aflor, El D√≠a de Palencia 15.12.17, available here Moreover, during the Great War Cirici sided with de Mella and assumed a decisively pro- German stand, definitely against the neutralist or pro-Entente leaning of Don Jaime.however, some contemporaries doubted whether his germanophilia was genuine and suggested that an intelligent man inside, he only \\"appears to be a troglodite\\": \\"Ventall√≥ es jaimista y no mellista, franc√©s y no alem√°n, cantor de La Marsellesa y enemigo de Torquemada. Pero todo esto lo es en la intimidad. Aparentemente es un troglodita horriplante\\", Luis Anton del Olmet, Los Bocheros, Madrid 1915, p. 147, available here In case of another thorny issue, the Catalan question, Cirici championed the anti-Catalanist cause and opposed Carlist participation in initiatives like Solidaridad Catalana; some dub him \\"the father of Catalan espa√±olismo\\".the opinion of Maximiliano Garc√≠a Venero, see Hoja Oficial de la Provincia de Barcelona 29.12.41, available here According to some authors, Cirici was gradually getting lukewarm about the Carlist cause.opinion of his biographer, √Ängels Carles-Pomar, referred after Sanlleh√≠ i Bitri√† 2007, p. 231. Another rather unorthodox Carlist feature was Cirici's preference for modernism and modern art; he frequented the iconic Barcelona \\"Els Quatre Gats\\" restaurant and was friend to Santiago Rusi√±ol, Carles-Pomar 2000, p. 29 Reception and legacy left During his lifetime Cirici remained a controversial figure, especially as a journalist. He was hailed by Conservative press as informed and competent commentator, expert on behind-the-scenes parliamentarian deals and \\"the best journalist in Spain\\".Diario de Valencia 10.03.12, available here The Republican and Socialist authors criticized and derided himsee e.g. La Bandera Federal 01.08.12, available here as \\"campe√≥n del cinismo\\";El Mot√≠n 13.01.16, available here his vehemence cost him a judicial investigation triggered by a French ambassadorLa Lectura Dominical 02.10.15, available here; the French were following Cirici quite closely and during the Great War he regularly appeared in digest of the foreign press, prepared by the French Ministry of War, see many issues of Bulletin quotidien de presse √©trang√®re, available here and periodical suspension of El Debate,El Correo Espa√±ol 13.01.17, available here he also became a point of reference for zealous germanophilia.Espa√±a 1916, available here As a novelist he was acclaimed for styleHojas Selectas 1918, available here and wit,El Defensor de C√≥rdoba 21.10.12, available here by some declared \\"una de las m√°s legitimas glorias del humorismo mundial\\" and the one who introduced political satire to Spain;El Norte 21.11.12, available here a however, it is difficult to tell opinion of informed literary critics from marketing.according to one source La Tribuna stopped serializing Memorias due to protests of its readers, El Cant√°brico 01.12.12, available here Commercially his novels were a success; while the Episodios nacionales Gald√≥s‚Äô books usually sold in 4‚Äì5,000 copies,Jes√∫s A. Mart√≠nez, Historia de la edici√≥n en Espa√±a, 1836‚Äì1936, Madrid 2001, , p. 79, Raquel S√°nchez Garc√≠a, La historia imaginada: la Guerra de la Independencia en la literatura espa√±ola, Madrid 2008, , p. 154 also the usual run of a novel at the time,Mart√≠nez 2001, p. 197 Rep√∫blica sold in 39,000 copies,in 2 editions, Carles-Pomar 2000, p. 26 Memorias in 15,000 copiesLa Hormiga de Oro 07.12.12, available here and Secreto in 20,000 copies,Mar√≠a Dolores Romero L√≥pez, Inventos y artilugios de ciencia ficci√≥n en la literatura de la edad de plata: de la fe en el progresso al desencanto [MA Complutense 2015], p. 20 all advertised as \\"most successful in bookstores in recent times\\".La Vanguardia 29 December 1916, available here. In comparison, the hugely successful Entre naranjos by Blasco Ib√°√±ez sold in 1919 in 85,000 copies, while Sin novedad en el frente by Remarque sold in 1929 in 110,000. The most popular \\"novelistas er√≥ticos\\" like Alberto Ins√∫a or Pedro Mata used to sell their best books in 30‚Äì40,000 copies, Mart√≠nez 2001, p. 202 The German translation of Secreto sold in 40,000 copies.Romero L√≥pez 2015, p. 20 Sales results would have made Cirici a rich man; however, pressed by daily needs he used to sell copyright to the editors.Cirici sold rights to Rep√∫blica for 10,000 pesetas, a very substantial sum given at the same time Unamuno in 12 years earned 4,000 ptas on sales of his 10 books, Mart√≠nez 2001, p. 201. The editor earned 100,000 pesetas from further Rep√∫blica sales. Similarly, La Tragedia was owned by El Debate, the paper which signed Cirici on exclusive contract. Cirici had no other income than his books and his press contributions, and he had to support a 7-person family, Diario de Valencia 09.12.17, available here Cirici's premature deathCirici died due to appendicitis, El Pueblo 09.12.17, available here was acknowledged by nationwide press. Many titles launched a charity campaign intended to help the widow and the orphansmany newspapers for months ran a charity campaign to assist the Cirici family, see e.g. El Debate 15.04.18, available here. The widow and 5 children had no income and apparently were left in financial dire straits. It is not clear whether the Cirici and the Bab√© families were in position to help, though the family of Ventall√≥ probably was able to provide some assistance and Alfonso XIII arranged for his oldest son to be admitted to the college free of charge.El Iris 20.02.18, available here In the 1920s he was noted in works on history of Spanish literature as the author of \\"novelas de satira pol√≠tica con gran conocimiento del asunto, donaire y originalidad\\";Julio Cejador y Frauca, Historia de la Lengua y Literatura Castellana, vol. XII, Madrid 1920, p. 144. Also an Italian literary review declared La tragediia \\"vivace pittura di costumi politici contemporanei, nella quale sono introdotti e disegnati alla brava gli alti personaggi della vita pubblica spagnola\\", La Rassegna della letteratura italiana 25 (1917), p. 374 in 1931, when the Republic was actually declared, some recollected his earlier fiction.El Luchador 04.09.31, available here. The author, Roberto Castrovido, dismissed Cirici's novel as half-baked fantasy and declared that the actual republic, born in 1931, had nothing in common with the corrupted, unstable, chaotic republic as depicted in 1911 Today the favorable opinion held by scholars like Cejador y Frauca does not stand; most historians of literature ignore himsee e.g. V√≠ctor Garc√≠a de la Concha, Agust√≠n S√°nchez Vidal, Historia y critica de la literatura espa√±ola, vol. 7, Madrid 1993, 9788474232318, Eugenio G. de Nora, La novela espa√±ola contempor√°nea (1898‚Äì1927), Madrid 1979, , Line Rodr√≠guez Cacho, Manual de historia de la literatura espa√±ola, vol.. 2, Madrid 2009, , Harald Wentzlaff-Eggebert, Las vanguardias literarias en Espa√±a, s.l. 1999, , Felipe B Pedraza Jimenez, Milagros Rodri, Manual de literatura espanola, Madrid 1980, and he is relegated to footnotes in works dealing with specific genres.

Some suggest he sort of commenced a trend, with Elias Cerd√° emerging as his follower in cultivating the genre.Nuevo Mundo 07.04.16, available here, Carles-Pomar 2000, p. 26. Interestingly, Cerd√° was a republican and published his dystopia as a counter-version to this proposed by Cirici; moreover, Cirici as an icon of obscurantism is mentioned in the novel himself: \\"Se viv√≠a en la creencia de que no quedaban ya m√°s tradicionalistas que Cirici Ventall√≥ para regocijar √° los ‚Äûneos‚Äù escribiendo chirigotas, y V√°zquez Mella para pronunciar discursos altisonantes, puesto de chambergo‚Äù, Elias Cerd√°, Don Quijote en la guerra, Madrid 1915, p. 74 Terrassa, historical archive Within the Carlist realm Cirici was initially viewed as a potentially great literary herald of the cause; in 1916 he was honored with a dedicated homage session involving the party leader Marques de Cerralbo, the key theorist Vazqu√©z de Mella and others;El Correo Espa√±ol 27.07.16, available here many party heavyweights attended his funeral, including de Cerralbo, de MellaLa Tradici√≥n 15.12.17, available here Conde de Do√±a Marina or Marqu√©s de Tamarit.El Correo Espa√±ol 10.12.17, available here However, he later went into almost total oblivion, except that some scholars claim a Traditionalist historian Melchor Ferrer Dalmau was influenced by Cirici's \\"espa√±olismo catalan\\".Hoja Oficial de la Provincia de Barcelona 29.12.41, available here Rather exceptionally he featured in Carlist propaganda of the 1960s, listed among key party men of letters like Manuel Polo y Peyrol√≥n or Luis Hernando de Larramendi.Montejurra 26 (1967), p. 40 Locally he is recognized as a noteworthy terrassenc in a biographical sympathetic article√Ängels Carles- Pomar, Domingo Cirici Ventall√≥, escriptor i publicista, [in:] Ciutat.

Retrieved 29 November 2018 vis Wayback Machine In December 1980, they finished producing an album, but it was not released until May 1981. The English press called the band 'Dead 69' or 'Sham Boys' in reference to the origins of the band members. In March 1981, the band's first single, \\"Ready to Snap\\" (B-side: \\"Beyond the Law\\"), was released, and the band played at the Lyceum Theatre in London. On 18 May, the debut album Only Lovers Left Alive was released, the title taken from the novel by Dave Wallis. The concept album tells the story of ex-CIA agent Peter Beter (who allegedly provided secret information on tapes) from the perspective of a teenager who wants to fight \\"the system\\" only to ultimately succumb to it. The album had 12 songs, and on the back cover art they printed \\"They Made Me Criminal\\". However, that song was never part of the album. The album got great reviews from the magazine Sounds, while the magazine Record Mirror reacted somewhat cautiously to it. Writing for Allmusic, Dave Thompson wrote that the album \\"remains one of the most foreboding records ever released and plunges the listener into a world of Bolshevik plots, duplicate Popes, and a third World War that is so close you can smell it\\". An Allmusic review described the music as \\"gutsy pop-punk built around razor-sharp guitars\\".Heibutzki, Ralph \\"Only Lovers Left Alive Review\\", Allmusic.

The sales expectations of Polydor Records were not met and they were also unsuccessful at self-funding a US tour. When Dave Parsons became infected with hepatitis, the band broke up. Stiv Bators and Dave Tregunna created The Lords of the New Church, while Ricky Goldstein joined the cover band, The Bootleg Beatles. After partial recovery, Dave Parsons then played for Framed and later coordinated a Sham 69 reunion. Only Lovers Left Alive was reissued on the Captain Oi! label in 2000.

King was an Irish political activist. King apparently spent time in Belgium before arriving in Liverpool in 1873. Around this time, he may have been connected with the International Workingmen's Association, which had established a branch of Irish workers in the city. At the time, the international was supporting Liverpool trade unionists against attempts to import strikebreakers from Belgium. King was active in the Irish nationalist movement, and also as a trade unionist. From 1889, he was the leader of the Lancashire Chemical and Copper Workers' Union, in one year increasing its membership from three to 11,000. While the union initially proved successful at increasing wages, company owners formed a syndicate in opposition to the union, which ultimately collapsed. During the coal miners strike of 1892, King organised relief work, with the support of the Mayor of Liverpool. He thereafter began lecturing on the desirability of a trades federation, and relocated to London, where he wrote weekly for The Clarion. Robert Blatchford approved of King's federation proposal; he co-authored a pamphlet on the topic with King, and serialised King's ideas in The Clarion under his own pseudonym. The Clarion sponsored the foundation of the \\"NIGFLTU\\", a democratic trades federation, but the Trades Union Congress backed a rival proposal, forming the General Federation of Trade Unions, and King's scheme proved unsuccessful.

Biography=Early life and career= Fraser was raised in Nuhaka, Hawkes Bay. Her parents were Ernest and Kate Tucker, the first of their eight children, and she had Ngati Kahungunu ancestry. She was educated in Gisborne at Kaiti School (1936‚Äì39) and then Gisborne High School (1939‚Äì43). At an early age she was interested in politics and she obtained special dispensation to join the Labour Party when she was 14 years old, becoming the youngest person to ever join the Labour Party in its history. She proceeded to form a junior branch of the Labour Party in Gisborne. At age 15 she was the branch delegate to the annual Labour Party conference, the youngest person there. In 1947 she married Bill Fraser, and had two children together. Bill was MP for St Kilda from 1957 to 1981 and Dorothy worked for many years as his unpaid electorate secretary. It was said by contemporaries such as Warren Freer that Fraser overshadowed her husband with many thinking that she was better suited to be in Parliament. =Political career= She served on Dunedin Hospital Board for 27 years from 1953 to 1956 and again between 1962 and 1986. She served as the chair of the board between 1974 and 1986, the first woman to do so. Initially she had to be persuaded to stand for the Hospital Board and did not expect to win. She was stunned at her election and the Monday after she planned to resign her seat, but was talked out of it by friends. She was a Dunedin City Councillor for four years, winning a by-election in 1970 (only the second woman elected) and was re-elected in 1971. In 1977 she unsuccessfully stood for Dunedin's mayoralty, finishing second to Cliff Skeggs. She was on the executive of the Labour Party from 1958 to 1961 and was made a life member of the party. =Later life and death= She served on over 40 small community organisations and directorships and consultancies including the Gibbs Committee (1987‚Äì88) and Monticello Trust Board (2001‚Äì08). Fraser died on 24 May 2015, aged 89. Her funeral service attracted 300 mourners. Honours and awards Fraser was made a justice of the peace in 1959, and in 1977 she was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. In the 1978 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1987 New Year Honours, for services to the Otago Hospital Board and the community. She was given an honorary Doctorate of Literature from University of Otago in 1994.

He was a co-developer of the RDS-37, the first Soviet two-stage thermonuclear bomb, and many other nuclear devices. Life and career Born in Leningrad, Avrorin graduated from the Physics faculty of Moscow State University and was directed to KB-11 ('Design Bureau-11), now called All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (RFNC-VNIIEF)) in the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region. There he worked on the Soviet hydrogen bomb programme. In 1955, he joined the new NII-1011 (Research Institute-1011, presently the All- Russian Scientific Research Institute Of Technical Physics (RFNC-VNIITF)) at another closed city, Snezhinsk (or Chelyabinsk-70). In 1956 and 1957, he performed unique experiments to find out why the RDS-37 exploded fractionally before modelled expectations, a result which implied a lack of knowledge of materials and conditions. During remainder of his career there, he became Head of the Theoretical Physics Department in 1964, the Head of Theoretical Physics Division in 1974 and the Scientific Director in 1985, a role he retained until 2007. From 1996 to 1998, he was also the overall Director. In addition to his work on many nuclear weapons, he was also known for investigating nuclear charges for civilian usage (e.g. potentially for mining copper), charge designs with very low radiation output and deuterium power engineering. He has written about the modern challenges to the closed cities whose industries are (largely) no longer required since the break-up of the U.S.S.R. He became the chair of the Snezhinsk branch of the Russian Pugwash committee and has been involved in international discussions about science diplomacy and confidence- building for international security.

It was designed and during 1881. It is also known as Former Ebsworth's Terraces and Ebsworth's. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The land on which the subject property was once part of a grant to Robert Campbell Senior in 1834. Campbell used the site west of the \\"High Street\\" (later George Street North or Lower George Street) and another closer to the western shore of the harbour to operate wharves and a successful mercantile business. Campbell & Co operated in the colony from 1800 and by 1804 the firm was heavily engaged in NSW trade. On 16 October 1834 Lot 1 (2 roods 15 perches), Lot 2 (3 roods 34 perches, later known as Lot 1), Lot 3 (3 roods 25.5 perches) and Lot 4 (2 roods 5 perches) were formally granted to Robert Campbell Snr \\"to promote the Establishment of Towns in the Colony of NSW\\". The grant was subject to conditions including the construction within three years of a permanent dwelling house with appropriate drainage on each allotment and payment of a \\"Quit Rent\\" over nine-years. Campbell used some of the land for his own business needs, leasing other parts for trade and port associated activities. It was one of a number of land grants acquired by Campbell in NSW. In early 1841 Robert Campbell Snr subdivided Lot 1 in preparation for sale. The site was roughly triangular-shaped and bound by George Street North on its eastern side and by New George Street (later renamed Gloucester Walk) to the west. Its western boundary was dominated by a long sandstone bluff running north-south along the peninsula, reducing in height toward Dawes Point to the north. The bluff separated Campbell's Lot 1 and Lot 2 further to the west. Campbell was willing to accept ¬£40,000 for his property of more than four acres adjacent to the wharf and including warehouses. Auctioneer Mr Thomas Stubbs described the land 'At Campbell's Wharf, Opposite the Entrance Gate' as, \\"All that well adapted and valuable plot of ground of the Estate of R. Campbell, Esq., M.C., and now subdivided into Six Building Allotments, open and immediately accessible to all the general shipping, Custom House, Bonded Warehouse, and harbour business of the trade and port of Sydney. (It) commands all the shipping lying in Sydney Cove\\".The Australian, 22 May 1841. The property, to be auctioned on 2 June 1841, bounded George Street and a short street \\"charted out as Union-street\\" (later renamed Atherden Street). In a prime position it sketches a carriage way and approach from Campbell's Wharf and George-street, to a proposed parallel extension of George-street, forking off from Essex-street, through Argyle-street, passing the Custom House, and joining Lower George-street again. The land was well-positioned for the construction of \\"properly built warehouses\\", for which there was a strong demand. The land was reported to have realised an average of ¬£16 per foot, however Land Titles indicate that Lots 9 and 10 remained unsold. Lots 1 and 2 were purchased by George Atherden, a wharfinger of Sydney, who in 1878 was to purchase Lots 9 and 10 (11 perches to the south-west corner of Campbell's grant), that are the subject site. By 1856 Atherden had constructed four stone cottages facing Union Street. They were listed in the City of Sydney Assessment Books from 1858. Robert Campbell Senior died at Duntroon on 15 April 1846. The estate included substantial acreages throughout New South Wales, as well as the residue of the George Street site and Lots 9 and 10. In 1848 the heirs to Campbell's estate agreed to partition the landholdings amongst the shareholders, with the 1 rood 32.5 perch residue of the George Street North allotment allocated to Arthur Jeffreys. The land remained part of the trust, and was left to \\"the use of his brothers-in-law\\". An 1849 road alignment plan confirms Arthur Jeffreys ownership of the land by at this time, as well as the lots that had been sold and the buildings constructed along George Street. Union Street is shown near the southern end of the site, bound on the north and south by buildings owned by Martyn and Coombes. George Atherden's premises are indicated on the southern boundary of Campbell's Lot 2. Arthur Jeffreys died in England in 1861 leaving his interests in the Campbell Estate to his son, John Jeffreys. Primary sources of this period confirm that Lots 9 and 10 remained vacant until the early 1880s. In 1873 a conveyance was made between John and George Campbell and John Jeffreys of Fernhill, England, in accordance with Arthur's will. By this time land titles indicate that it was the sole remaining allotment of Campbell's grant in The Rocks and known as Lots 9 & 10 (11 perches). In February 1878, ending a long period of ownership by the Campbell family, George Atherden purchased Lots 9 and 10, adding to his substantial land and business interests in The Rocks, at this location. the Union Street had been renamed Atherden Street after George Atherden who owned property on the south side of the street and lots facing George Street. In October 1878 George Atherden sold Lots 9 and 10 to Edward Stanley Ebsworth (1832-1901). A month prior to this Ebsworth had purchased land nearby, facing George Street, commencing the construction of five terraces at the George Street site. By Ebsworth had built a terrace on the Union Street allotment. Sydney Municipal Council's Assessment Books indicate that the Union Street terrace consisted of two, two-storey, four-roomed residences constructed of brick with slate roofs. The Atherden Street terrace, although not as ornate as the George Street terrace, or in such a prominent position, was a modestly scaled and detailed bald-faced Victorian Style residential structure, typical of the period. The brickwork was stuccoed and the roof a simple pitched gable over the main, two- storey section of the house. The terrace was built close to the escarpment rising to Gloucester Walk and opposite a row of four similarly modest houses that had been built in 1880 by Thomas Playfair, on the southside of the street. The terraces at the west end of Atherden Street would have stood in contrast to the single-storey, stone cottages built by Atherden in the 1850s immediately to the east of number 1-7 Atherden Street. By 1882 Ebsworth had leased No. 2 Atherden Street to Walter Bell, and No. 4 to George Cook. The gross annual rating was ¬£52 for each property. Numbers 2 and 4 first appear in the Sands Directory in 1883 showing Mr Bell's occupation as sailmaker and Cook's as a wharfinger, consistent with the demography of the area at this time. Like many of the rental properties in The Rocks area, in the 19th century the tenants of the Atherden Street houses tended to be one to three years at the most. A few tenants returned at various time to live in other houses in Atherden Street. At this time the population of The Rocks was diverse, including high numbers of immigrants, often with trades related to maritime and wharf activities. A brief survey of the names and occupations of Atherden Street tenants listed in the Sands Directory provides an indication of the backgrounds of Rocks residents of the period. Atherden Street residents included sailmaker, wharfinger, master mariner, waterman and storeman. A few had trades such as painter, engineer and blacksmith; while a number are shown as clerks. Women's occupations shown include laundress and dressmaker. Unfortunately the Sands Directory does not indicate the diversity of women's occupations in the 19th century as women were only listed when the woman was the sole adult occupant or householder. The Sydney Real Estate Bank Limited represented by Leonard Dodds, purchased the two properties from Ebsworth in 1888 and they continued to be leased. The bank had mortgaged the properties by 1889 and transferred them to the Perpetual Trustee Company Ltd in 1892. Council Assessment Books indicate that from the Perpetual Trustee Co. was the owner of 2 and 4 Atherden Street. Increasing unsanitary conditions in some parts of the city, and an outbreak of bubonic plague in late summer of 1900, resulted in a large-scale resumption of land by the Public Works Department of NSW. The aim was to selectively demolish substandard or badly planned residential and commercial buildings, followed by the replanning of some areas and selected rebuilding. A Royal Commission was appointed to gather expert evidence on the best way to effect the \\"Improvement of the City of Sydney and its suburbs\\" and its conclusions were published in 1909. On 3 October 1903 Lots 9 and 10 were resumed under the Act \\"in connection with a system of Public Wharves approaches thereto at Darling Harbour and the waters at Port Jackson\\". The Sydney Real Estate Bank Ltd, the owner of this and a number of adjacent sites (33-41 George St), had gone into voluntary liquidation in 1893 and the Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd was now the \\"mortgagee in possession\\". The Atherden and George Street properties were valued at a total of ¬£7250, an amount accepted by the liquidator as full compensation. The NSW Government became the official owner and landlord for the resumed properties. Resumption records relating to the valuation and assessment of the houses in Atherden Street have not been located and it can only be assumed that their construction and condition were assessed by the Public Works Department as being satisfactory and to be retained. In 1918 the Sydney Harbour Trust (known from 1936 as the Maritime Services Board) took over administration of resumed properties in the Darling Harbour - Rocks area. The remodelling of The Rocks was carried out gradually although some of it was never realised. Although numbers 2 and 4 Atherden Street and numbers 1-7 remained intact, four stone cottages, built by George Atherden in 1855 on the south side of the street at its eastern end, were demolished by the Sydney City Council in 1920-1. This allowed for the continuation of Harrington Street (this section later renamed Playfair Street in 1953) to George Street via Atherden Street; as well as for road widening. Circa 1922-23 Atherden Street was renamed Atherton Place, the name referring only to the length of roadway from Playfair Street to the cliff face to the west. The new configuration of the streets is illustrated in a City of Sydney Detail Sheet prepared in the early 1960s. In 1969 the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority Act led to the formation of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority in 1970 one of the responsibilities of which was the administration of The Rocks properties including 2 and 4 Atherden Street. The Authority was renamed the Sydney Cove Authority in 1991, the functions of which were assumed by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority in 1999. =The Residents of Avery Terrace= The street will generally be referred to by its current name \\"Atherden Street\\" although it is noted that for a period it was officially known as \\"Atherton Place\\". The history of 2 and 4 Atherden Street is intimately linked to the people who lived there. Little more than basic information has been able to be discovered about the late 19th century tenants of 2 and 4 Atherden Street. In the late 19th century until the first decade of the 20th century lessees of 2 & 4 Atherden Street tended to stay for between one and three years. In contrast, in the 20th century tenants stayed far longer in the one house, some remaining in the locality for generations. Numbers 2 and 4 Atherden Street are of particular significance, becoming known as Avery Terrace due to long-term tenancy of the Avery family in one or both of the houses from . Around 1980 the words \\"Avery Terrace\\" were signwritten in ornate upper-case typescript on the buildings. Nineteenth-century terrace houses have been known to be given the name of a property holder but rarely that of its tenants, as in this case. The Avery family's history in The Rocks dates to the late 19th century. In the 20th century Avery family members have lived in a number of houses in Atherden Street including one of George Atherden's stone cottages and in Playfair's Terrace, both on the south side of the street. John \\"Yankee Jack\\" Avery and his wife Margaret settled in The Rocks in 1878. In the 1870s Jack Avery reputedly \\"jumped ship\\" from an American vessel, marrying Margaret Long, a local woman soon after his arrival in Sydney. In 1897 the Averys were living at 89 Gloucester Street and their son William Ernest Avery and daughter-in-law, Eva at No. 83 from 1899-1900. Eva Garel's grandparents, Richard Byrne and Margaret Kelly had lived in Cumberland Street from in a house built by Byrne, a stonemason by trade. Although some family members moved away from The Rocks many maintained a connection - staying permanently or moving back from time-to-time. Unlike many other The Rocks residents who worked in wharf related trades, before World War I William and Eva Avery ran a tobacconist on the corner of Kendall Lane and Argyle Street. No. 2 Atherden Street The first tenant of 2 Atherden Street was Walter Bell, sailmaker, followed by Robert Jones. The house's number varies in the 1885 edition and it is likely that William Lloyd was the tenant for about three years, followed by William Walsh. Captain Williams occupied the house followed by William A. Grant, Master Mariner, who lived there until . The Rocks was populated largely by people in maritime related activities and included immigrants such as Edward Gullicksen (Gulliksen) from Norway. Gullicksen, his wife Sarah and three small children called No. 2 Atherden Street home for two years. Captain James Donnelly, his wife and children moved to No. 2 . , Donnelly was living at 1 Atherden Street showing that residents moved from one house to another, in the same street, over a number of years; possibly due to varying rentals or the extent and standard of accommodation. Donnelly and his family later moved to 5 Atherden Street on the other side of the street. William Ernest Avery was the first of the Avery family to take up residence in Atherden Street at No.13, one of George Atherden's four 1850s stone cottages. This marked the beginning of a long period of residence by the Avery family in Atherden Street. John Avery () moved to No. 2 around the same time as William Ernest Avery (1880-1942) moved into No. 1, on the opposite side of the small street. In 1921 John, a coal- lumper, shared No. 2 with Eva Frances Avery (1881-1959), Charles Avery, a publisher, Stephen Charles Avery, a labourer, Florence Avery and Gertrude Rebecca Avery. Several generations of the family shared the household. John's occupation as a coallumper, loading coal onto or off the vessels at the wharves, would have been arduous and no doubt had health risks. It was a common occupation for men in The Rocks. The NSW Statistical Register of 1928-9 recorded that mean in this trade were earning 3s 2d per hour for a forty four hour week; amounting to ¬£6/12/4 per week. Rent for a four-room brick house around the same time was 22 shillings and eight pence per week; just less than 20% of his wage. Charles Avery's profession, shown as a publisher stands in contrast to John's and many others who lived in The Rocks. By 1928 fifteen adult members of Avery family were living in Atherton Place in four of the six houses numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. It is likely that a number of children also lived there. It was not uncommon for the two bedroom terrace houses in inner city areas to accommodate an extended family of 6 to 10. With the increasing acceptance of women in more diverse roles in the workforce, young women such as Gertrude May Avery, a packer, would have been able to make a contribution to household expenses. Stephen Avery's job, a \\"motor-driver\\", was evidence of the diversification in men's occupations and new opportunities offered with the advent of motor transport, where previous generations of the family had worked on the wharves or in manual trades. Interestingly William's World War I AIF records indicate that the Atherton Place address was recorded as Millers Point or Dawes Point at various times although there were no official suburban boundaries in the area until 1993. It is possible that this was a postal boundary. Electoral Rolls of the 1980s show Atherden Street's location as \\"Sydney\\". From and again from c. 1950-58 four houses in Atherden Street, or Atherton Place as it had become known, were occupied by the Avery family or its descendants. As studies show, the Averys were one of many \\"Rocks\\" families to live close proximity to one another. When inner-city families did move house, it was often only a block or two away at most. It was not uncommon for family members to informally \\"swap\\" their houses, as Dolly Bonnette and her mother Eva Avery did, from No. 1 to No. 7. This might have been to suit changing accommodation needs and shows that records may not accurately reflect an individual's residence. Living in close proximity provided a valuable support system for families in the generally close-knit community. Grace Karskens' research into the history and archaeology of The Rocks revealed that women such as Eva May Avery and her mother Catherine Garel were known for their neighbourliness, earning them the community's appreciation and respect. Atherton Place, a cul de sac ending in a large rock face, was an ideal location for street parties and it was common for the piano to be brought out with all welcome to join-in, especially at Christmas and New Year's Eve. John Avery remained the official lessee of No. 2 until May 1944, just prior to which the rent was recorded as being 18 shillings and 6 pence per week. NSW Death Registers however indicate that John Avery died in 1934 and that tenancy records were not updated. The properties were relatively inexpensive to rent with the Maritime Services Board paying rates, taxes and insurance, and making it worthwhile for the family to retain the lease. The lease was subsequently taken on by Florence Avery (possibly John's daughter) for a short period in mid-1944 and transferred to Gertrude Crutcher (n√©e Avery), continuing the house's connection to the family. In 1945 Joseph Edward William \\"Teddy\\" Avery took over the lease of 2 Atherden Street. Teddy Avery (1907-1981) was the youngest of William and Eva Avery's sons and lived in The Rocks with Dorothy, his wife and their two children James and Yvonne. Like many Rocks men, Teddy worked on the wharves throughout his working life. The rent continued remained the same until 1952 when regular rate increases were instituted, starting at ¬£1/2/6 per week. By 1961 the rent had risen to ¬£1/13/- per week. Mrs Hazel Carmela Ballard moved into No. 2 in 1961 and nothing is known about this period of tenancy. By 1972 George Edward Bonnette and his mother, Hannah Jane Catherine 'Dolly' Bonnette (1910-1993), had moved into No. 2 Atherden Street, opposite numbers 1 and 7, where she had been born and where they had lived at various times. Dolly (1910-1993), the seventh and last child of Eva and William Avery, was born into the extensive Avery family in 1910, living for most of her life in The Rocks. She took great pride in her \\"Rocks\\" background and in later years eagerly shared her history. Some of her recollections were recorded in interviews by journalists, the Department of Local Government (1963-4) and the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (1971), leaving a valuable record. Other sources include family history research by Val Garner, titled Irish on The Rocks: The Descendants of Richard Byrne and Margaret Kelly (1997). As pointed out by historian Grace Karskens, although it was men's work that tied or drew families to waterside neighbourhoods like The Rocks, it was also common for women to bring their husbands to live there so they could remain near their mothers and sisters and the community they knew so well. By 1947 Dolly and George were living at 7 Atherton Place where she had been born, sharing the house with Eva Avery, Dolly's mother. Others living in the house at the time included John Frederick Avery, Dolly's nephew, as well as William James Avery (1900-1960) and his wife Agnes Esther \\"Aggie\\" Avery, Dolly's brother and sister-in-law. By this time Dolly and George had four young children, stretching the capacity of the small, two-storey terrace. It did not seem unusual for The Rocks family, and Dolly recalls that at times there were fifteen living in the house at No. 5 Atherden Street. In the first half of the 20th century many of the married Avery women did not work outside of the home, listing their occupations in official records as home duties. A few like Margaret and Gertrude worked as packers in local warehouses, while Doreen was a shop assistant. George Bonnette, Dolly's husband was a typewriter mechanic with Stott & Underwood, unlike most of the Dolly's brothers who worked in wharf related trades. Dolly's older brother who lived with them, William \\"Cocka\\" Avery, worked as a wharf labourer, eventually working his way up to the respected position of stevedore. Dolly Bonnette revelled in the renewed interest in The Rocks that began in the 1970s, staunchly advocating the preservation of the residential precinct, protection of its close community and celebration of its colourful history. Between 1971 and 1972 Dolly moved to No. 2 Atherden Street, living next door to her son in No. 4. In 1975 the Sydney Cove Authority renovated both. Until Dolly Bonnette's death in 1993 she was the oldest living descendant of Richard and Margaret Byrne living in The Rocks. No. 4 Atherden Street The 1883 edition of the Sands shows George Cook, Wharfinger, as the first tenant of 4 Atherden Street, the construction of which had been commissioned by Edward Stanley Ebsworth c.1881. Cook soon vacated the two-storey, four-roomed terrace which was then leased for an equally short time by Charles Annis (or Armis) until c.1885. Short periods of residential tenancy were possibly linked to casual employment on the wharves or in businesses nearby. The description of the house as being of four rooms is thought to refer to the living areas. The services areas were included in Council assessments from 1896; however the numbering often appears arbitrary, changing from one assessment to the next. Periods of tenancy by William Meddowes, a clerk (), Thomas Webb () and Mrs Sophia Petersen () followed. George Craig leased the premises , staying there for almost a decade - unusual given late 19th century trend of short tenancies. NSW birth, death and marriage records show that George Craig and his wife, Agnes Dundas had eight children between 1870 and 1884 and it is likely that a few of the younger ones would have lived with them at Atherden Street. From 1903 tenants included John Brown (), James H. McClure (), Alexander Roube ( & 1920), Carl Roux (, 1921‚Äì23) and John Crealy (). The Sydney City Council's Assessment Books show the tenant as \\"Roux and Co\\" from 1924-5. Little information is known about these tenants. In June 1928 William James \\"Cocka\\" Avery (1900‚Äì60), a wharf labourer took up the lease of No. 4 at a rental of ¬£1/1/- per week. The rent was higher than charged for No. 2, despite the houses being the same size. It is possible that the interior of No. 4 was in better condition than the neighbouring house, although no detailed records have been located that might explain the discrepancy. The small, two-bedroom terrace was also home to Agnes Esther \\"Aggie\\" Avery, William's wife, and (Joseph) William Edward \\"Teddy\\" Avery (1908‚Äì81), William's younger brother, also a wharf labourer. As mentioned previously, by 1930 fifteen adult Avery family members were living in four of the six houses at the end of the cul de sac. By 1937 William James Avery and wife Agnes shared the house with Charles Avery, William's uncle, and Dolly and George Bonnette, William's sister and brother-in-law. Dolly's two small children added to the already large household. Eva Frances Avery took up the lease on No. 4 in January 1938 sharing the house from 1941 with daughter Eva May \\"Maisie\\" Young (1902-1950), Eva's husband George Victor Young and their three children. Maisie took over the lease in March 1942. By 1947 the house was also home to Doreen Florence Avery (b.1924), Maisie's niece. Despite her death in 1950, Maisie's name remained on the Tenancy records until November 1957. Nita Louisa Allen n√©e Young (1929-1995), one of Maisie's three daughters, took up the lease of No. 4, living there from November 1957 until the late 1960s, continuing the house's connection to the Avery family. Nita Allen, later Nita McCrae, is recognized for her role in mobilising The Rocks community in protesting against the planned comprehensive redevelopment of the area which ignored the area's rich history and gave little consideration for its long-term residents. The plan included large-scale demolitions in the area and the construction of high-rise buildings. Nita was instrumental in the formation of the Millers Point Action Group in 1969 and The Rocks Resident Action Group in 1971. She enlisted the assistance of the builders' labourers' and workers' unions leading to the implementation and enforcement of industrial or \\"Green Bans\\" to stop the destruction of numerous culturally significant sites. Nita McCrae and The Rocks Resident Action Group were ultimately successful in forcing the revision of the original redevelopment plans for The Rocks, saving numerous significant buildings and the oldest residential precinct in Sydney. In 1996, in the year following her death, a plaque honouring Nita McCrae's achievements was unveiled by the Minister of Urban Affairs and Planning, Craig Knowles, at her 35 George Street home where her campaign to save The Rocks had started. From 1972, 4 Atherden Street was home to George Bonnette, Dolly Bonnette's son, and Suzanne Bonnette, however in 1974 when funds were allocated by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority for renovations, the house was reported to be vacant. Building work was carried out in 1975 and further work in 1995-96. The Avery family descendants no longer live in Atherden Street, marking the end of an era. Avery Terrace remains residential, however they are not the large extended families of the early 20th century, nor are they employed in the traditional occupations that once drew them to the waterside suburb at the heart of Sydney. Despite obvious changes and the commercialisation of the area to cater for the tourist trade, the area maintains its historic residential precinct, which with a number of surviving 19th century commercial buildings, is integral to the history and character of The Rocks.FORM architects (aust) pty ltd, 2007.  Description  A pair of two storey Victorian Regency terraces, each two bays wide, constructed of stuccoed brick with simple pitched iron roofs between flanking and common brick walls. Windows have single pane sashes with flat arched heads. This and the facing terrace at 1-7 Atherden Place are built within two metres of the ten metre escarpment at the end of the street.National Trust, 1976. Style: Victorian; Storeys: 2; Roof Cladding: Corrugated Iron; Floor Frame: Timber. Potential archaeological resource = Modifications and dates = The terraces were restored and renovated in 1975. This included demolition and removal of rear fences, all timber and galvanised well and associated lean-to roof. A section of the WC outhouse and a section of the chimney were also demolished. Tar paving and concrete were removed from around the terraces and they were repaved. The internal floors were checked and floorboards removed where necessary. Subfloor spaces were cleaned where necessary and building material and miscellaneous rubbish removed. New services, plumbing and wiring were installed. = Further information = The renovations and restoration work in 1975 may have disturbed the archaeological deposits in the rear yards and sub floor spaces. However, there is no indication in the reports of large scale excavation of these areas so it is very possible that significant archaeological information is still in situ.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, Avery Terrace and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. They owe their continuous existence to the esteem in which they are held by the local community, and by the wider community as evidenced by their listing on the registers of both the National Estate and the National Trust and also evidenced by the efforts in the 1970s to save them from demolition as part of the Green Ban movement. The site of Avery Terrace is important in the history of the establishment and development of Sydney as a colony as evidence of land granted to Robert Campbell Senior in 1834 and its later subdivision and sale. Avery Terrace, 2 & 4 Atherden Street, is significant to the 19th and 20th century history of The Rocks as evidence of a small residential development commissioned by Edward Stanley Ebsworth in c.1881. Avery Terrace is important as one of a group of residential buildings surviving the demolitions that followed land resumptions under the Public Purposes Acquisition Act (1900). Avery Terrace is significant in NSW for its long history of residential tenancy and is valued for its association with the working-class families, largely employed in maritime and wharfside occupations. Avery Terrace has a strong and special association with the Avery family who lived in Atherden Street from c.1914 and in Avery Terrace from c.1917 until 1993. The item is associated with Nita McCrae who is recognized for mobilising The Rocks community in protesting against redevelopment plans that disregarded the area's rich history and long-term residents. The form, scale, planning and detailing of Avery Terrace are evidence of Victorian Regency Style terrace housing of The Rocks. It is notable for the high standard of construction and detailing and, despite some alterations, it remains a good example of its type. Set against the sandstone escarpment Avery Terrace, with Playfair and Argyle Terrace, make an important contribution to the late 19th century character of the streetscape. Avery Terrace is a rare example of a bald-faced, Victorian Regency Style terrace and is one of a surviving group of this style. The high quality construction and detailing is uncommon in working-class rental housing of the era and contributes to its rarity. Avery Terrace was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site is evidence of land granted to Robert Campbell Senior in 1834, and a number of stages of subdivision and sale of the Campbell Estate up until 1878. Avery Terrace, 2 & 4 Atherden Street, The Rocks demonstrates late 19th century residential development of the site by Edward Stanley Ebsworth. The terraces in Atherden Street were leased with Sergeant Majors Row, 33-41 George Street, also commissioned by Ebsworth. Avery Terrace, with Playfair and Argyle Terrace nearby, are good examples of the construction of rental housing in or near the precinct. Avery Terrace is significant for its long history of residential tenancy, never having been owner-occupied. The site, resumed in 1903, is evidence of extensive land resumptions under the Public Purposes Acquisition Act (1900). The terrace survives as evidence of the buildings that escaped the widespread demolitions, either due to their standard or construction or usefulness as workers' rental housing administered by the Sydney Harbour Trust and subsequent authorities. The site is important in the history of the establishment and development of Sydney as a colony, while Avery Terrace is a significant to the 19th and 20th century history of The Rocks. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Avery Terrace is significant for its association with the land's earliest owners in the 19th century, as well as the houses' 20th century tenants, in particular the Avery family and Nita McCrae. In the early 19th century the site is significant for its association with large areas of land granted to Robert Campbell on the west side of Circular Quay, linked to Campbell & Co and its commercial activities. From the late 19th to the mid 20th century Avery Terrace and other houses in Atherden Street were associated with numerous tenants, many of whom were employed in maritime and wharfside occupations. Avery Terrace has a strong association with the Avery family after which the terrace is named. The family traces its history to Richard Byrne and Margaret Kelly who settled in The Rocks c.1807. Members of the Avery family lived in Atherden Street from c.1914 and in Avery Terrace at No. from c.1917-18. One or both of the houses was occupied by an Avery family descendant until 1993. Nita McCrae, an Avery family descendant, was brought up in Atherden St, living at 4 Atherden Street as a child, and as an adult from the 1950s until c.1969-70. She is recognized for her role in mobilising The Rocks community to protest against redevelopment plans which ignored the rich history of The Rocks and giving little consideration for long-term residents. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The form, scale, planning and detailing of Avery Terrace is evidence of Victorian Regency Style terrace housing of a modest size. Distinctive characteristics include its symmetrical presentation, stucco finish and subtle modelling of the fa√ßade. The high quality of its construction and detailing is unusual for rental housing of this type and is evidence of the standards set by Edward Stanley Ebsworth who commissioned its construction c.1881. Despite some alterations, including those to the interior and exterior of the rear extension, it remains a good example of Victorian terrace housing in The Rocks, sharing similar characteristics and qualities to this type of housing in east Sydney. Avery Terrace forms a group with Playfair and Argyle Terrace which are of a similar style and scale. The group retains many intact architectural elements, and survives as evidence of a late 19th century streetscape in The Rocks. Avery Terrace makes a significant contribution to the current streetscape against the backdrop of the natural sandstone escarpment to the west. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Avery Terrace has a strong and special association with the local and wider community as evidence of Sydney's rich history; and housing leased from the late 19th by working- class families who were until the mid 20th century largely employed in wharf or maritime activities. The high social significance of Avery Terrace, and nearby 19th century buildings, is demonstrated by the community activism on a local and State level saving many from demolition in the 1970s. Avery Terrace is held in high esteem by the community at a Federal, State and local level demonstrated by its inclusion in statutory and non-statutory heritage registers, individually and as part of The Rocks. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Avery Terrace has little potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the lifestyles of its working-class tenants due to considerable site disturbance from the 1970s and 1990s renovations. It is possible, however that the subfloor areas, courtyard and the former outhouse retain some archaeological deposits. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Avery Terrace is a rare example of a bald- faced, Victorian Regency Style terrace, unlike the more common Victorian Filigree Style of the era, associated with decorative cast iron verandahs and plaster ornamentation. It is one of a surviving group of terraces of this style including Playfair Terrace opposite and Argyle Terrace in Playfair Street. The high quality construction and detailing of Avery Terrace is rarely associated with working-class rental housing of the era and adds to the importance of the structure. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The form, scale, planning and detailing of Avery Terrace is representative of Victorian Regency Style architecture built in late 19th century Sydney, and a good example of its type.

He succeeded Clive Lawrence as the Ministry's solicitor in 1923 and two years later joined the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel as Third Parliamentary Counsel; he was promoted to Second Parliamentary Counsel in 1929 but was overlooked when Sir Maurice Gwyer was appointed from outside the office as First Parliamentary Counsel in 1933. Ram was, however, promoted when Gwyer resigned in 1937 and served as First Parliamentary Counsel until his own retirement in 1947.\\"Ram, Sir (Lucius Abel John) Granville\\", Who Was Who (online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2017). Retrieved 7 November 2018. Ram's work in the OPC encompassed a range of important acts. He was responsible for drafting the Trade Disputes Act 1927; under Gwyer, he was allowed to draft a number of acts alone, including the Unemployment Act 1934 and the Public Order Act 1936; he worked with his superior on the Abdication Act 1936, which allowed Edward VIII to abdicate. As First Parliamentary Counsel, he drafted wartime legislation, most notably the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1940, and the landmark Education Act 1944; for the first two years of the Attlee government, Ram was responsible for overseeing its sweeping reforms turned into legislation. His 1945 memorandum on the eponymous Ram doctrine has become a famous explanation of the UK government's common law powers. He was also keen to reform and consolidate statute law and, on retirement from the OPC in 1947, he served until his death as Chairman of the Statute Law Committee and was responsible for 29 consolidation acts after the committee was given new powers to recommend minor amendments. According to Jason Tomes writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Ram was \\"perhaps less scholarly and certainly more rumbustious than the typical parliamentary counsel\\"; he ran the OPC like his own chambers, and was defensive of his staff to outside criticism, but could be highly critical himself, if also keen to help their careers.

It has images of Imam Ali and Haji Bektash Veli in it. History According to tradition, its eponymous founder was the Alevi dervish Durbalƒ±. Hailing from Konya in central Anatolia, he reportedly arrived at Ireni, as Asprogeia was known under Ottoman rule, in . As a reward for his military service, including in the pacification and Islamization of Thessaly, the local Ottoman authorities granted him the license to build a tekke. As is frequent with tekkes, it was built on the ruins of a 10th-century Byzantine monastery dedicated to St. George. A fresco depicting St. George, who like many Christian saints was also venerated by the sufis, survives on the walls of the tekke. Some modern scholars, such as the archaeologist N. Giannopoulos, believe that Durbalƒ± Sultan was a legendary figure, and that its Ottoman name Durbalƒ± Tekke derived rather from a corruption of t√ºrbe, \\"tomb, mausoleum\\", with its name thus meaning \\"Tekke of the Tombs\\". Indeed, from the architectural features of the complex and the dates on the surviving tombs, it has been suggested that the tekke was founded in the second half of the 18th century. The tekke quickly became wealthy and powerful, being awarded estates () of over 32,000 in Ireni and Arduan (Eleftherochori). In about 1770 it was occupied by the Mevlevi order. Following the annexation of Thessaly to Greece in 1881, the tekke continued to function without interruption. According to the archaeologist Frederick Hasluck, in there were 55 dervishes living in the tekke, while in 1892, the Greek novelist Andreas Karkavitsas visited the shrine and wrote about his experiences there in the Estia newspaper. In 1925, following the abolition of the sufi orders in Turkey by Mustafa Kemal, the tekke was taken over by the Albanian Bektashis, who remained there until 1973, when the 33rd and last abbot (baba) died. In 1925, many Albanians who were hostile to the Albanian King Ahmet Zogu, who had persecuted them, found refuge in the tekke on behalf of the Greek state. In the mid-1930s, the tekke was inhabited by 6 elderly Albanian dervishes under their leader Kiaxem Baba. The dervishes were known to be very hospitable. Outside the courtyard of the tekke there was a small mosque, called the \\"Temple of Durbalos\\". Description The tekke is located on a spur of the nearby mountains, with a good view over the Thessalian plain. As was usual for both Christian and Muslim monasteries, it is surrounded by a wall for safety, reinforced with towers and crenelations. A water spring is at the entrance of the complex, which comprises two large and distinct areas, in turn surrounded by walls: the cemetery in the south, and the residential area in the north. The residential area included stables, a kitchen, storage rooms, guest houses, and a building for the ritual purification of prospective abbots. Most of these buildings are in a ruined condition today. The cemetery comprises two t√ºrbes and 33 tombs. The western t√ºrbe is the oldest, with dimensions of 6√ó7√ó7,5 m. Its masonry is of irregular ashlar blocks surrounded by bricks, which according to some scholars dates it to the 16th century. Byzantine spolia were also used in its construction. The eastern t√ºrbe is of similar dimensions and houses three tombs. The two t√ºrbes are linked by a low modern cement structure that houses two tombs. The tekke has been declared a protected monument. The tekke still belongs to the Bektashi order, but its de facto management is under the land office of the Larissa Prefecture, leading to disagreements and legal ambiguity over its ownership status and problems with its maintenance.

He received elementary education in Banjarbaru, before moving to Jakarta where he studied in a state-funded middle school. After completing his high school at SMAN 3 Jakarta, he graduated with a bachelors in corporate management from Jayabaya University in 1988. Later on, after entering public office, he studied for a masters in politics and another degree in international relations from Padjadjaran University. Simbolon is of Batak descent, and is the chairman of the Simbolon clan's association (Punguan Simbolon Baruna Indonesia). Career Prior to being elected into office, Simbolon worked as a consultant for a fertiliser company and later in various management positions. Simbolon was first elected into the People's Representative Council following the 2004 legislative election. Simbolon was reelected in the 2009 legislative election after winning 59,718 votes. He was part of committee investigating the bailout of , and called for the resignation of vice president Boediono (who was governor of Bank Indonesia when the bailout happened), in addition to the firing of involved ministers including Finance Minister Sri Mulyani. Later in his term, Simbolon ran in North Sumatra's 2013 gubernatorial election, but lost. Later on in 2017, he declared his intent to run in the 2018 gubernatorial election, but ended up not running. Following the 2014 legislative election, Simbolon was elected for his third term in DPR, winning 89,028 votes. He became a member of the body's first commission, which handles defences and foreign relations. In 2018, a bullet that went astray from a nearby firing range ended up in his office at the DPR/MPR Building. Within PDI-P, Simbolon was appointed as head of resources and funding of the party's central committee in 2010, though he did not retain a position in that committee for the 2015-2020 period. =Attacks on Jokowi= Early into new president Joko Widodo's tenure, Simbolon attacked a policy removing fuel subsidies, despite threats of being sanctioned by his own party. In January 2015, Simbolon once more criticised the government of Widodo, and called for his impeachment. Simbolon remarked that Widodo's government was \\"turbulent\\", and \\"did not have a clear system\\". He commented then that Widodo will be impeached \\"within months\\". Simbolon again called for Widodo to resign in September 2015 for economic issues and the declining value of the Indonesian rupiah. Following an shooting of three police officers in Puncak Regency by Free Papua Movement militants, Simbolon blamed Widodo for relaxing visa requirements and not being sufficiently harsh towards the separatism movement. During a forum in 2015, Simbolon remarked that \\"Jokowi is not [part of] PDI-P, and was just using PDI-P as a vehicle\\". Further criticism continued when Widodo reshuffled his cabinet in 2016, including several ministers which was part of the previous government - resulting in Simbolon attacking it as a \\"recycled cabinet\\". Simbolon also openly disagreed with Widodo's decision to grant amnesty to Acehnese rebel leader Din Minimi in 2016. However, in 2017, Simbolon praised Widodo's government, though he added that the Widodo administration's actions then were different compared to its first two years.

It was built from 1842 to 1843 and the front facade was designed in 1927-8 by Howie Moffot & Co. It is also known as the Former Central District Ambulance Station and Ken Duncan Gallery. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  A plaque to mark the site as the location of the Central District Ambulance Station from 1927 to 1990. The site was a part of the first hospital site. Lot 2 of Sydney City Section 85 was originally granted to William Carr and George John Rogers by Crown grant in October 1838. In February 1839, Frederic Wright Unwin became one of the owners of the Carr & Williams grant and on 26 February 1842 Unwin conveyed to Matthias Hooper lot 8 of Unwin's subdivision. Hooper erected a public house on lot 8 in 1842-43 which was called the \\"Kings Head\\". The three storey building containing ten rooms was constructed with brick walls and a slated roof. The public house was described as having \\"every convenience\\". The building was 25 feet wide by 40 feet deep. Hooper was the publican of the \\"Kings Head\\" until he conveyed the property to William Carss in December 1849. Carss employed Edward Hancock to manage the public house during 1850. In March 1853, W. Carss and his wife conveyed the \\"Kings Head\\" to William Anthony Wright. Wright leased the hotel to George F Ewen, publican, who managed the inn from 1854 to 1859. During 1855 Wright erected stores to the rear of the lot, along the southern boundary against Mrs. Samson's Cottage. on January 21, 1856 W. A. Wright conveyed the public house to Thomas Goudie a confectioner of Sydney. During 1860-61 James Goudie managed the inn which was still known as the \\"Kings Head\\". In September 1870, Goudie conveyed the property to Andrew Henry Julius Baass, accountant, who in the same month sold the property to Joseph George Raphael, merchant. Raphael changed the hotel's name to the \\"Great Pacific Hotel\\" in 1874 and in the stone perimeter walls were erected to the north and west boundaries of the allotment. In 1885, the Hotel's name was changed again to the \\"P & O Hotel\\" by the new licensee Mrs. Mary A. Ferguson who remained until 1891. In December 1900 the property was resumed by the NSW Government. The P&O; Hotel operated until at least 1909. The Salvation Army, Naval and Military Home was established in 1911 and remained the tenants until 1927 when the building was renovated. In March 1927 Howie Moffot & Co. submitted plans for alterations to the building and in 1928, after the completion of the facade and internal works, the Circular Quay Depot of the Central District Ambulance Service began operations.SCRA 1979: KL/08 In 1950 the Housing Commission was responsible for the leasing of the property, rent was charged at per annum. In 1971 the upstairs rooms were rewired, painted and refurnished to provide school and demonstration facilities for Introductory Training Classes for recruits for the Central District. At the end of 1973 classes ceased when responsibility for training was transferred to the NSW Ambulance Board. In the mid 1980s there was a proposal to establish an Ambulance Service Museum on the premises and for a time several old Ambulances were on display. By late 1990 the premises were found to be infested with white ants and the floor boards, particularly on the first floor were unsound and creating an occupational and safety issue. The premises were vacated on 9 November 1990 and the lease relinquished to the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority.Sheedy 1991: 16 From 2008 to 2018 the Ken Duncan Gallery occupied the premises, after which, it became the head quarters of The Argyle Network, an Australian Technology recruitment business. =Archaeology notes= *Lease to William Balmain,AR033-034; AR036-037; AR044-045; AR145; AR149 by 1800. *Lease to William Gaudry,AR033-034; AR036-037; AR044 January 1810. *Granted as Lot 2, Section 85 to William Carr and G.

Various dates to these structures. 1842-1843, 1870; Built By: 1840s The building at No. 73 George Street North, The Rocks, the former Ambulance Station, is a two-storey masonry walled structure with a cellar and attached roof over a rear yard enclosed by sandstone boundary wall on two sides (now demolished). The building used to cover the entire site between George Street and Kendall Lane at the rear. The single pitched gable roof is of corrugated iron and is screened from George Street by parapets.Sheedy 1991: 18 Style: Georgian Art Nouveau; Storeys: three including basement; Facade: 1928 Modelled Facade; Side Rear Walls: Sandstone brickwork; Roof Cladding: Corrugated Iron; Floor Frame: Timber, Concrete; Ceilings: 1st floor pressed metal. = Condition = As at 3 May 2001, archaeological condition assessed as partly disturbed. Assessment basis: Floor level with George Street, and terraced up to level of Kendall Lane. Investigation: Monitoring during works 1994. Evidence of deposits. = Modifications and dates = In March 1927 Howie Moffot & Co. submitted plans for alterations to the building and in 1928, after the completion of the facade and internal works, the Circular Quay Depot of the Central District Ambulance Service began operations.  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, the site became of State heritage significance for its historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The main building is significant in that it retains a majority of building fabric dating from 1842 and its site was an allotment subdivided by Frederic Unwin. The main building is also significant in remaining possibly the oldest surviving identifiable hotel building in The Rocks area. The sandstone and brick perimeter walls to the rear yard are significant in dating from the middle 19th century and demonstrate the hotel's yard evolution. The main building retains the potential for its return to its near original configuration and street appearance to complement this highly significant surviving 19th century townscape precinct in George Street. The building and site has been associated with many uses throughout its long history, its use as a hotel being of predominate significance, and it illustrated the changing social fabric of the area which once had a concentration of public houses demonstrating the importance of the consumption of alcohol to the economy of the area. The construction of the building clearly demonstrates the form of 19th century building techniques and the improved standards pertaining to a hotel building. The size and scale of the building continues to make an important contribution to the streetscape of George Street and sympathetic relationship to nearby similar buildings. The site has important associations extending back in history to the establishment of the first hospital in the colony in 1788 and also has significant associations with many 19th century historical figures including Surgeon William Balmain, Frederick Garling, Frederic Unwin. The site development illustrates the way an intensive urban use character evolved reflecting the growth of The Rocks Area generally.Sheedy 1991: 32 High Significance Fabric: Remaining 19th century fabric of east, west, south and elevations; remaining early 19th century fabric of north elevation; remaining 19th century wall enclosures. Medium Significance Fabric: Remaining late 19th century fabric of north elevation; timber joists and pressed metal ceiling (first floor) Low Significance Fabric: 20th century components of north, west and south elevations; 20th century roof forms; visible 20th century alterations including joinery (ground floor); 20th century partition wall and joinery, timber flooring and fluorescent lights and electric fan (first floor). Shop, Ken Duncan Gallery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The adaptation of the original Colonial hotel into an Art Nouveau utility building effectively illustrates the redevelopment of the Rocks, and Sydney. It has value as a greatly altered but remaining identifiable example of the early development in Sydney. The changing uses of the building are very significant i.e. hotel, Salvation Army, Naval and Military Home and Ambulance Station, in portraying the changing history of the precinct and Sydney. The infill building allows the historic pattern of early subdivision in 1841 by Frederic W. Unwin of The Rocks are to be clearly understood. The building has associations with significant 19th century historical figures, including surgeon William Balmain, Frederick Garling senior and junior and Frederick Unwin. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The later Art Nouveau facade is well detailed, and illustrates an important surviving adaptation of an early hotel building into a utility building. The form, scale, detailing and material of the facade contributes greatly to this very significant streetscape. This is particularly relevant with the many nearby buildings in The Rocks of the same architectural style, i.e. -30's which all contribute to give the area a strong and rich historical character. The fine 1880s rock faced perimeter wall is significant as well detailed rear and side boundary wall. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The use of the former early 1842 public house or hotel with \\"every convenience\\" is very significant to this period of the Rocks precincts and Sydney. The Salvation Army, Naval and Military Home use between 1911 and 1927 . The change of use to an Ambulance Station in 1927 is significant. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The form of early construction with a sandstone basement and three storey brick building. The sandstone retaining walls supporting the brick wall above indicate an important early method of construction. The later 1927 alterations to the building and the transformation of the facade into a modern style of the time.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History Albert Palmer moved to Owosso from Jackson, Michigan in 1875. He founded a construction firm with his brother Harmon, and the two men built many of Owosso's residential and commercial buildings. One of the first buildings constructed was this home for Albert, built in 1875. The home was later split into a duplex residence for Albert Palmer's two sons, and later was the residence of Rudolph J. Beehler, Jr., a local cabinetmaker. In the 1980s, the house was restored as a single family residence. Description The Albert Palmer House is a five bay, two story L-shaped Italianate house with a hipped roof. It is simple in overall massing and design, but has rich ornamentation around the windows, and more at the corniceline. Trabeated enframements, topped with molded wood lintels, surround windows on the first floor. On the second floor, an elaborate carving is on each lintel. The eaves are supported by carved brackets.

The school building from College De Klop was demolished and a new neighbourhood was built on the area. The new merged school was housed in the building of College Blaucapel for 10 years. A new school building was constructed in the backyard of the old building. The school moved to the new building during the Christmas holidays in 2014/2015.  Education  The students in the building have their own classroom spaces, so called 'domains'. As opposed to most schooling in the Netherlands, the teacher comes to the students instead of the other way around. This way the students have their own place in the school building. The school is the only school in Utrecht offering Technasium education. In this education trajectory students get an additional subject called Research & Development (R&D;). The goal is to introduce students to technical professions.  Architecture and Art  Decoration in the old building by Dick Elffers.

The 15 kilometre-long line was opened on 25 October 1856 by the St. Gallen-Appenzell Railway and follows its original course, except for the tunnel between St. Gallen and St. Gallen St. Fiden and a little curve straightening. The line ran from Rorschach Hafen station to St. Gallen, with trains having to reverse in Rorschach.  History Before the opening of the Rosenberg tunnel, the line ran through the town of St. Gallen. Note the cutting in front of the former school crossed by a footbridge The line was built by the St. Gallen-Appenzell Railway (Sankt Gallisch-Appenzellische Eisenbahn, SGAE). About a year after the opening of the first section of the route, the whole Rorschach Hafen (harbour) ‚Äì Rorschach ‚Äì St. Gallen route was opened on 25 October 1856. Operations on this line through the Steinach valley between M√∂rschwil and St. Gallen was very slow, because a rise of about 250 metres had to be climbed on this section of the line. The route became part of the Swiss Federal Railways during the nationalisation of the railways on 1 July 1902. Electrical operations commenced on 15 May 1927 at 15,000 Volt 16 ‚Öî Hz between Winterthur and Rorschach. The section between St. Gallen and St. Gallen St. Fiden was originally built with a single track in a cutting, over which several footbridges and bridges were built. Congestion of this section was expected with the construction of the Bodensee‚ÄìToggenburg railway (Bodensee-Toggenburg- Bahn). It was decided to move the line underground, as it was not considered possible to rebuild the line with double track in the open. As a result, St. Gallen station was rebuilt and relocated. The new section was put into operation with the 1466 metre-long, double-track Rosenberg Tunnel on 1 April 1912. Goldach Viaduct, in the background is the village of Goldach and Lake Constance The railway line crosses an area affected by earth creepage in the Steinach valley in Galgentobel. This has caused rail operations to be interrupted several times. After the slope slipped again in early summer 1975, an emergency bridge had to be built in the summer of 1975. As a result, this section needed to be bypassed by a new bridge. This project included the duplication of the track. Therefore, a 568 metre-long bridge was built on the valley side. The prestressed concrete bridge has ten piers. The second track was not relocated initially. The stress test was carried out on 4 April 1982 with twelve Ae 6/6 locomotives. The bridge distorted by 15 millimetres which corresponded with the calculated values. (photos 126-127) The bridge was then handed over to traffic. The extension of double-track towards M√∂rschwil was made only after the construction and the inauguration of the bridge. Thus, later there was an isolated section of double track between M√∂rschwil and the newly created operations yard at Engwil. This situation continued until 2008, when the section between M√∂rschwil and Goldach was rebuilt as double track. articulated railcars in M√∂rschwil running as the S2 service (St. Gallen‚ÄìRorschach‚ÄìAltst√§tten) In 2001, Rorschach-Stadt (town) station was added. It is planned to complete the doubling of the line. Duplication is now complete between St. Gallen St. Fiden and M√∂rschwil. Today only part of the line between Goldach and Rorschach is still single track. Duplication of this section is planned to be carried out from 2016 until the end of 2018.  Operations In local traffic, the line is used by the lines S 2, S 3 and S 4 of the St. Gallen S-Bahn and by the Rheintal-Express. In long-distance traffic, it is used by the Zurich‚ÄìMunich EuroCity service. The railway line is used on weekdays by around 110 passenger and 10 freight trains.

It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon and built in 1912. It is also known as Chamber of Commerce Building and Johnson's Overalls Building (Johnsons). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site occupied by 233-35 George Street was once part of the original Parade Ground of the Colony. By the 1820s this corner site was still owned by the NSW Government. In the site was subdivided into four allotments. Of these, three fronted George Street and one Grosvenor Street. A small lane which opened onto Grosvenor Street separated this latter from those with George Street frontages. The corner site at Grosvenor and George Streets was purchased from the Government in 1831 by Anthony Hordern and remained the property of the Hordern family until the NSW Government Rocks Resumption Act of 1901. The building erected by Hordern on this site, which appears in Fowles engraving of 1848, remained essentially unaltered until 1911/12 when demolition occurred for the widening of George Street, together with the 1845 building to the north owned by Alexander Douglas from 1831 until 1901. The site to the north of Douglas block was purchased from the Colonial Government in 1831 by John Richards. These four properties were demolished in 1911/12 and the new Chamber of Commerce Building was erected in 1912. James Johnson had a long association with the corner site and, for a lesser of time, with the Douglas property adjoining to the north. James Johnson, draper and clothier, was associated with this site since 1867, and the building is probably known as to many people for its association with Johnson's Overalls, and associated range of chef's and steward's clothing and equipment.SCRA, 1982: 10-12. From 1980 negotiations proceeded with the private sector on proposals for mixed development and recycling on the land bounded by George, Grosvenor, Harrington and Essex Streets, known as Sites D5, D6 and D11. The agreement for the Grosvenor Place project was signed in June 1983 involving the renovation of Royal Naval House and four adjacent buildings, including the Johnson's Building. Work on Grosvenor Place commenced in 1984 and was completed in 1988. In 1987, work commenced on the $12.5 million reconstruction and renovation of Royal Naval House and Federation Hall in Grosvenor Street to enable the buildings to house the Sydney Futures Exchange. The work involved the reinstatement of the original verandah and courtyard in a new location, and the restoration of the street facades. The reconstruction and renovation of the three remaining historic buildings on the site, including the Johnson's Building, was carried out in 1989 for use as bars and restaurant.

Description  Johnson's Building is a six-storey Edwardian brick-clad building in the Federation Free Style, notable for its vertical emphasis provided by the narrow pilasters which divide the fa√ßade between high narrow windows. The George Street fa√ßade is adorned with two storey bay windows under 5th floor semi-circular windows symmetrically placed about a central bay which has a three arch arcade to the fifth floor. On either side of this above the bay windows at roof level is a simple pediment. The splayed corner carries a curved balcony providing access to a flag pole. The Grosvenor Street fa√ßade is less decorative with the exception of the large arched entrance incorporating a board of chequered terracotta and sandstone. Sandstone trimmings frame most openings and the high pitched roof of slate is visible behind the pediments.National Trust listing 1980 = Modifications and dates = In the late 1980s, major work was undertaken to the group of buildings to enable their reuse. The street facade, including awning and shopfront were conserved.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, Johnson's Building and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. As a group, the buildings (Federation Hall, Royal Naval House, Johnson's Building, 231 George Street and Brooklyn Hotel) have considerable significance.

Origin  Although Sheki halva has its own recipe and characteristics, this type of halva is thought to have originated in ancient Mesopotamia. There are some stories known in Sheki regarding Sheki halva's origins. According to one, it was prepared by cooks of the Sheki khan who loved sweet desserts and ordered to make something very sweet. As a result, the cooks prepared Sheki halva and it became very popular in this region. Another story assumes that the origins of this halva came from Tabriz as Mashadi Huseyn, a merchant from Tabriz, came to Sheki and informed local merchants about the recipe of halva.  Preparation  Top layer of rishta decorated with saffron Sheki pakhlava has three main parts: rishta, stuffing and syrup. The main ingredients are rice flour, sugar, peeled hazelnuts, coriander seeds, cardamom, and saffron. One of the specific requirements for Sheki pakhlava is to use rice flour ground only in a water mill. The other characteristic is containing grid-shaped rishta made by pouring kneaded dough onto a hot griddle through a special funnel with eleven holes and baking it in a minute. Stuffing is made of crumbled hazelnuts, ground cardamom and coriander seeds. After placing 8‚Äì10 rishta layers on a round copper tray, the stuffing is added and then it is covered with 5‚Äì10 rishta layers. The top layer is decorated with saffron in a square shape reminiscent of shabaka. It is generally baked over charcoal for 10‚Äì20 minutes. Hot sherbet syrup is poured on Sheki halva before leaving it to rest over 8‚Äì10 hours.

After successfully completing her school education, she first studied philosophy at the Sorbonne where she came in contact with Suzanne de Dietrich, Charles Westphal and Claire Julien of the World Student Christian Federation who deepened her interest in the church. Convinced that she had been called to the service of God, she was inspired by Pastor Marc Boegner of Passy- Annonciation to study theology. As a result, she went to the University of Geneva, where she graduated with distinction in 1934. She had hoped to become a pastor but there were no arrangements for women to do so. Instead, Andr√©- Numa Bertrand, head of the Union of Reformed Churches arranged for her to go to Sainte-Croix-Vall√©e-Fran√ßaise in the south of France where she worked as a parochial assistant, organizing courses and contributing to the activities of the local YWCA. In early 1941, Schmidt was invited to help to care for refugees at the Gurs internment camp but after working there for six months, she contracted typhoid and had to leave. The following year, she was assigned to the parish of S√®te. In 1949, at the invitation of the parishioners, she was ordained on 20 October by the regional president in a service conducted by Pastor Westphal. She continued to serve the parish until 1958 when she requested a transfer to Algeria. Encouraged by Andr√© Chatoney, head of the church's Algeria Region, she had chosen Algeria not only to help with suffering and confusion there but because there was a real need for a pastor in Blida-M√©d√©a. When she arrived, she did her utmost to build bridges between the local Muslims and the French colonialists, although she felt she was living in a European ghetto. In particular, she arranged courses in reading, sewing and child care for young Muslim women. But she was equally concerned at the plight of the French women in the area who were experiencing a growing feeling of insecurity. In the end, as the number of her parishioners continued to decrease after the √âvian Accords in 1962, she finally returned to France in 1963, after receiving an invitation to take up an appointment at the parish in Nancy. She enjoyed the atmosphere of the university town, taking up once again the cause for women's ordination. She took part in the national synod as a delegate representing the east of France. After lengthy discussions, it was finally decided that women should be admitted as ministers of the church on the same basis as men. √âlisabeth Schmidt remained in Nancy until her retirement in 1972 when she joined her sister in Castres where she died on 14 March 1986.

After passing through the courts of Terrassa, Sant Boi de Llobregat and Badalona, since 2003 he was in charge of the Court of Instruction number 13 of Barcelona. He issued controversial orders of provisional detention against the squatting movement and anti-establishment groups. Career He began his judicial career via public tendering in 1991, when he was 44 years old. On 17 May 1994, he was appointed magistrate. Until that moment, he was judge of first instance and instruction of the court number 3 of San Boi de Llobregat and then was assigned to the court of first instance number 5 of Tarrasa. At the end of the 1990s, he was a member of the electoral board of Barcelona. In 1997 he was transferred to Badalona and on 24 October 2000 he became the dean of the courts of Badalona, where he was the judge of first instance court number 5 and then number 4. In 2003, he moved to court number 13 of Barcelona. In 2004, he carried out various cases against the squatting movement. He instructed the case for an attack with incendiary devices at the police station on Carrer de Santst, and ordered the imprisonment in the Trinitat Vella prison of two young people aged 18 and 19 from L'Hospitalet de Llobregat. They were released 60 days later because there was no evidence to incriminate them. The trial declared them innocent and the State had to compensate them. In June 2005, he ordered the imprisonment of three demonstrators of an anarchist solidarity march. In 2014, a member of the Castellers de Barcelona was imprisoned preventively under Ram√≠rez Sunyer's orders for allegedly participating in demonstrations in favor of Can Vies in May. He spent 24 days in prison until an acquittal was pronounced. In September 2015, he opened proceedings against the general director of the Catalan police for \\"failure to prosecute the offense\\" after jeers occurred during the singing of the Spanish national anthem on 30 May at Camp Nou. Beginning in March 2017, Ram√≠rez Sunyer instructed the \\"Cause of the 13th\\", an investigation derived from a complaint by Vox for the statements of former judge and former Senator on the preparations of the Government of Catalonia for the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. The first researchers, besides Vidal, were , director of the Institut d'Estudis per l'Autogovern and , Secretary of Finance of the Catalan Government. His investigation involved the registration of the National Theater of Catalonia, where the act of presentation of the Catalan Referendum Act of 4 July 2017 was held. He also made a statement to a dozen senior officials of the Catalan Government and officials, as well as business executives who competed to manufacture the ballot boxes for the referendum vote. In September 2017, Ram√≠rez Sunyer stopped carrying the cause after being challenged because he was declared \\"contaminated\\" by Operation Anubis. He was replaced first by the judge of the Instructional Court 29 and, from 13 December onwards, by Jaime Conejo, formerly in the 16th court of Barcelona. =Operation Anubis= Under his orders, on 20 September 2017 the Civil Guard enacted Operation Anubis; in the Department of Economy, Welfare and Social Affairs, the Department of Government and Foreign Affairs, in the Open Administration of Catalonia, in the ICF and in the CTTI (Center for Telecommunications and Information Technologies of the Generalitat of Catalonia), 12 people were arrested. For this reason, the Catalan Government announced the filing of a complaint against Ram√≠rez Sunyer and the Civil Guard.

Although the school was founded in Basra, modern-day Iraq, its followers subsequently sought refuge in Oman, Yemen, Hadramawt in the southeast peninsula of Arabia, and North Africa. Though largely ignored by the mainstream of Arab and Muslim scholarship, and scarcely tapped by Orientalist research, there does exist a continuous tradition of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ scholarship throughout the centuries to this day.  Philosophy of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology  The development of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology, also known as IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ KalƒÅm (an approach to Islamic theology likened to scholasticism), can be traced to the works of scholars and imams of the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community, whose histories, lives, and personalities form part of the greater Islamic history. IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology can be understood on the basis of the works of theologians Ibn IbƒÅ·∏ç, JƒÅbir bin Zayd, Ab≈´ 'Ubaida, Rabƒ´' b. ·∏§abƒ´b, and Ab≈´ SufyƒÅn among others. Although IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´sm was extinguished in Basra, the foundation of the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community, in the late 2nd century AH (ca. 8th century CE), the Ibadi teachers of Basra and their works continue to constitute sources of inspiration for the life and teaching of the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community. For this reason, IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ teaching is difficult to properly understand without an awareness of the life, history, and personalities of the Basra community and a knowledge of the growth of the various IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ communities that were mainly established in southern Arabia, Oman, North Africa, and East Africa IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s today prefer to be known using the term Mu·∏•akkima, and consider themselves their descendants. However, they reject the extreme tendencies of the KhawƒÅrij, differentiating themselves from insurgents and extremists. This position is expressed explicitly by the \\"most prominent IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ KalƒÅm theologian\\" of the 2nd century AH (ca. 8th century CE), 'Abd AllƒÅh b. Yazƒ´d al-FazƒÅrƒ´, in the only surviving folio of his brief work K. al-FutyƒÅ.Wilkinson C. John, (2010) IbƒÅ·∏çism: origins and early development in Oman. Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press, 2010, pp.153 . The basic principles of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology do not differ from those of the other Islamic schools, the madhƒÅhib, but it has its own identity which, for IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s, is the true Islamic identity. IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s accept the Qur'an as the fundamental source of Islamic faith and life. They also value the a·∏•ƒÅdƒ´th of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions (·π¢a·∏•ƒÅba), who preached and interpreted the Qur'an in the Muslim community. The IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ approach to the theological, legal and social problems that develop in various Qur'anic verses is based on the words and traditions of the Prophet and the traditions of the Prophet's companions and their students.  The imamate of Basra  Following the example of their first Imam, Jabir ibn. Zayd, IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theologians find support for their views in a large number of companions of the Prophet (·π¢a·∏•ƒÅba), particularly  ªAbdullƒÅh b. Al-'AbbƒÅs, cousin to the Prophet Muhammad and a distinguished interpreter of the Qur'an.  ªAbdullƒÅh b. Al-'AbbƒÅs was one of the first Muslims to undertake the interpretation (Tafsƒ´r) of the Qur'an. The ra ºy method of Qu'ran interpretation used by  ªAbdullƒÅh b. Al-'AbbƒÅs was subsequently adopted by IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ and Mu ªtazila scholars to metaphorically interpret the various Qur'anic names for God and to avoid tashbƒ´h (anthropomorphisms).Abdulrahman Al-SƒÅlimƒ´, (2014). \\"IbƒÅ·∏çism and the creation of the Qur'ƒÅn\\". In Francesca, Ersilia. Ibadi Theology. Rereading Sources and Scholarly Works. 4. Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag AG. pp. 144. . An important contribution to the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s' theology came from the third Imam, Al-Rabƒ´ ª b. ·∏§abƒ´b b.  ªAmr al FarƒÅhƒ´dƒ´, who incorporated the a·∏•ƒÅdƒ´th (the sayings and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad) into the ƒÅthƒÅr of the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community. From the beginning, learned men and spiritual leaders of the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community developed a spiritual and intellectual movement which closely followed the religious, political, and social ideas of Islam, and elaborated on religious and theological teachings on all matters related to Islamic society. The IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ movement sees itself as the guardian of Islam against the secularisation of power (the Muhakkima). As such, it developed‚Äîtogether with the Mu ªtazila movement‚Äîa rich theology that transformed Classical and Late Antiquity to the demands of the prophetic word. IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology embraces the fundamental principles of Islam, and purports to be based on the Qur'an, the Prophet Muhammad, and his companions (·π¢a·∏•ƒÅba, tƒÅbi ª≈´n wa tƒÅbi ª≈´n at-tƒÅbi ª≈´n), the life and works of which were incorporated into the ƒÅthƒÅr of the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community. The major theological and philosophical issues facing the community relate to God, the world, and human nature, and were negotiated in the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community by its leaders and teachers. Belief in one God is the foundation of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´sm. Faith means confession that God is absolutely one, i.e., confession of absolute monotheism (taw·∏•ƒ´d). IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology, therefore, includes teachings about God, His creation, and humans, and discusses the essence and existence of God on one hand and, on the other, His relationship to His creation and creatures, especially his rational creature, the human being. These fundamental teachings of faith constitute the \\"roots\\" (u·π£≈´l) or the \\"principles\\" of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology, which are called u·π£≈´l (singular, a·π£l) or  ªaqƒÅ ºid ( ªaqƒ´da).Yohei Kondo, (2014). \\"The Concepts of walƒÅya, barƒÅ'a, and wuq≈´f among 2nd/8th ‚Äì 3rd/9th Centuries IbƒÅ·∏çis\\".

The IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s, according to their narratives, were one of the first to approach the Qur'anic passages and formulate the basic theological principles of Islam. They gave great weight to the 112th sura of the Qur'an entitled \\"Surat al-IkhlƒÅs\\" or \\"Surat at-Tawhƒ´d\\" which declares the believer's sincerity with all purity of heart for his faith in the one God, i.e., true monotheism.A.T.

Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten. And there is none like unto Him. With this surat and other Qur'anic passages, IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology emphasizes that God is the only being that has no resemblance to His creatures. Nevertheless, God is the creator of the world, and He is the One Who reveals the law and the truth in the Qur'an and cares for His people. Because \\"He is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, it is He Who gives life and causes death; and He is Able to do all things. He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Highest (nothing is above Him) and the Nearest (nothing is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of everything. He is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then IstawƒÅ (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)\\" (Surat 57, 2-4). This is a passage that describes God's greatness and omnipotence, and the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s interpreted it allegorically (Ta ºwƒ´l) to avoid anthropomorphism. The IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s applied the same interpretation to all the Qur'anic \\"beautiful names\\" (al-asmƒÅ º al-·∏•usnƒÅ) that refer to the hand of God (al-yad) to express His power, and the eye ( ªayn) to indicate His global supervision. The image of God sitting on His throne (istiwƒÅ º  ªalƒÅ al- ªarsh) was interpreted as His governance of the universe.

Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag AG. pp. 239-249. .  Main doctrines  IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology emphasizes the unintelligible and impersonal nature of the divine essence, and asserts that God's being is inseparable from His essence. God's being, however, becomes concrete when it is connected to the Divine names and Divine properties that are made manifest in the moral and physical order of the world. God, therefore, has 99 beautiful names, because He, the \\"odd\\" (al-witr), loves these names. The 100th name is dhƒÅt, the essence of God, which cannot be contained in the human mind, and is therefore unknown and inconceivable. It constitutes His internal hypostasis. God, however, is made known to the world with the rest of the names that He revealed in the Qur'an and with which He communicates with His creatures. The names of God are neither identical with God, nor different from Him (hal asmƒÅ º AllƒÅh hiya huwa am ghayruh). The names are not part of God, nor are they added to the divine essence, since thus God would be divided. God, however, is not portioned; He is one and indivisible. In this sense, the attributes of His essence are eternal. The names, however, that we ascribe to God are our own words and, as such, are created concepts. The attributes of God, therefore, are external characteristics created by man and ascribed to God's essence from outside, and are, therefore, not eternal.Douglas Leonard, (2014). \\"Anthropomorphism of the Divine as Metaphor in Early IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ Theology and Reformed Calvinism\\".

IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ Theology in North Africa in the Modern Period\\". In Francesca, Ersilia. Ibadi Theology. Rereading Sources and Scholarly Works. 4. Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag AG. pp. 267. . To distinguish between the eternal God and his non-eternal or created attributes, the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s used Aristotelian terms that had entered into Arabic philosophy, viz., the terms jawhar (substance) and  ªara·∏ç (accident). The essence of God is single and eternal while His attributes are created accidents which are added to it from the outside. Similarly, the question arose whether the Qur'an was created or uncreated. The Ash ªarite and Sunni teachings profess that the Qur'an is the word of God and therefore eternal and uncreated. The IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s tend toward the Mu'tazilite position and believe that the Qur'an is the created word of God. As with the Christians, the Muslims too adopted the arguments of Greek philosophy, particularly Aristotelian logic, to support their positions. It is worth emphasising that, from as early as the 7th century, Islamic theology was familiar not only with the terms \\"essence\\" and \\"accident\\" from Aristotelian logic, but generally also with its syllogisms.Douglas Leonard, (2014). \\"Anthropomorphism of the Divine as Metaphor in Early IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ Theology and Reformed Calvinism\\".

Rereading Sources and Scholarly Works. 4. Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag AG. pp. 153. . A major, related problem is God's justice ( ªadl), which was widely discussed by IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theologians.Wilferd Madelung, (2014). \\"IbƒÅ·∏çiyya and Mu'tazila: Two Moderate Opposition Movements in Early Islam\\".

The issue that arose surrounded God's relationship to the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community and the faithful's relationship to God and their fellow men. For the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community, the concepts of walƒÅya (friendship/communication) and barƒÅ ºa (excommunication) were of the greatest importance. Which of the faithful and members of the community are worthy of walƒÅya and which of barƒÅ'a, and why? What is the relationship between faith and unbelief (imƒÅm wa kufr)? Who is a mu ºmƒ´n (believer) and who a munafiq (hypocrite) and what is kufr an-ni ªma (unfaithfulness or ingratitude)?Abdulrahman Al-SƒÅlimƒ´, (2014). \\"IbƒÅ·∏çism and the creation of the Qur'ƒÅn\\". In Francesca, Ersilia. Ibadi Theology. Rereading Sources and Scholarly Works. 4. Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag AG. pp. 145-147. . Another issue discussed was the question of qadar (free will) and good deeds. The question of qadar, regarding divine decision and free will, was one of the main issues within the first IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community. Many debates took place between the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s, the Qadariya, and the Mu'atazila. Some IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s, like al- FazƒÅrƒ´ of the 8th century, were critical of determinism.Salimi al Abdulrahman, Wilferd Madelung (2014) Early IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology. Six KalƒÅm texts by 'Abd AllƒÅh b. Yazƒ´d al-FazƒÅrƒ´, Leiden: Brill, 2014, . The IbƒÅ·∏çiyya came to consider other Muslims as merely hypocrites (munƒÅfiq≈´n) and neglecters of the true faith (kuffƒÅr), not as mushrik≈´n, or those who worship gods other than the singular god. As such they allowed social intercourse, intermarriage, and mutual inheritance, but not religious association (walƒÅya, tawallƒ´) with them. They mostly abstained from the armed revolt against the Umayyad government until the  øAbbasid revolution in 127 AH, or 746 CE. In the twenty-first century, atomic theory was adopted by Islamic schools, including the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´, to prove the existence of God. According to this theory, God is one, indivisible, and eternal. He is to be distinguished from every other atom in the universe, with which He has no similarity. In this sense, God is  ªayn, the primordial atom, the subject of God (dhƒÅt), beside which there is no other atom, i.e., a second subject. God constitutes the identity of predicates.Ahmed Ismail, (2014). \\"The Theory of the Atom in the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´, Ash øarite and Mu Ωtazilite Schools\\". In Francesca, Ersilia. Ibadi Theology. Rereading Sources and Scholarly Works. 4. Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag AG. pp. 203, 209. . Some authors of this period contribute substantially to the formulation of early Islamic thought, whose ideas are characterised by a rationalist reconciliation, understanding, and engagement of Islamic theology. Their contribution is important not only to the systematization of the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ madhhab but also to the renaissance and promotion of dialectics within Islamic theology that would later lead to its systematization by the several Islamic schools. It is particularly important to note that early IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ and Mu'tazilite thought that predates the formative Islamic period (and which often remains opaque to modern researchers) utilized philosophy from the classical period and Early Antiquity, imbuing old notions‚Äîsuch as the aforementioned ones of substance, atoms, essence, attributes, etc.‚Äîwith new meanings. What can be understood from the ideas of the early IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s and Mu'tazila is that their ideas helped diversify Islamic intellectual and theological discourse. They have had an important impact on the history of the Muslim world; their contribution was the codification of Islam. IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s also created a rational discourse that promoted the study and hermeneutics of Islamic texts and scriptures. Some of the thinkers in the Muslim world came out from this movement, either inspired by or opposed to it. IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s are still producing writings and theology in contrast to the Mu'atazila, who have been lost to Muslim history. Recent research focuses on these issues in all their dimensions from the beginnings of the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ community and until the 12th century.

It was built for Thomas Ryan in 1830. It is also known as Gumnut Cafe (No. 28). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  It is believed that the cottages were built between 1823 and 1829 on the site that had previously been the garden of the Assistant Surgeons House, for Thomas Ryan. Originally one room deep, they were purchased by William Reynolds in 1830. The dwellings were constructed as simple working class buildings, however, due to the abundance of local sandstone, most of the housing for the working classes was built in stone. William Reynolds of Harrington Street is listed as a ship smith in the 1836-1840 Magistrates Returns. Due to housing shortages, Reynolds built a number of small, poor standard houses in the vicinity including five in the courtyard behind the cottages between 1839 and 1841 (subsequently demolished in the 1880s). This area gained a reputation in the 1850s - 90s as the haunt of criminals and prostitutes. During the 1891 Royal Commission into Chinese Gambling, Immorality and Police Corruption, it was noted that an opium den existed in one of the dwellings in the courtyard. The rear brick addition to No. 30 was added in the 1850s, the east wall constructed over an earlier well. Sydney Council's first rate assessment in 1845 indicates that Reynolds' children retained ownership of the property and others in the area and rented out the five houses hereon. No. 28 and No. 30 were described at this time as two, two storey stone and shingled houses, each with four rooms and the necessary outhouses. No. 32 differed, as it was constructed in timber. It would appear that the building continued to be tenanted, however, in July 1850, the Reynolds' mortgaged the Harrington Street premises to John Brown Esquire. This was subsequently surrendered and a second mortgage registered. In an indenture dated 12 November 1857, made between Maurice and Margaret Reynolds and Charles E. Langley and George Stabler, the mortgage was discharged. On his death in 1860, the Harrington Street premises formed part of the insolvent estate of Maurice Reynolds of Burwood. The property included a house and adjoining land facing George Street and various small brick and stone houses in Reynolds Lane (now the Suez Canal). In 1863 the latter were described as unoccupied and according to the 1863 Assessment Book, \\"much out of repair\\". Land title documents indicate that Margaret Reynolds retained ownership of the property at this time, however re-mortgaged to Langley and Stabler following the death of her brother in 1861, and to John Blaxland and George Stabler on the death of Charles Langley in 1864. In an indenture dated 28 November 1870, Margaret finally conveyed her interest in the property, Allotment 2 of Section 84 with all buildings thereon, to John Blaxland and George Stabler and their heirs. Further confusion arose, as according to the Assessment Books, William Scoles was recorded as the owner of No. 28-32 Harrington Street in 1867, however all the land title records up to this time give no mention of a William Scoles. The three properties were in turn passed to Elizabeth E. Stabler and John Blaxland following the death of George Stabler in 1873. From the 1860s, the Sands Directory indicates that the houses were occupied by several long term tenants. John Scoles (assume also Skulls in 1866 listing), noted as being a labourer, carter and a porter, is listed at No. 4 (No. 28) from 1866 until 1875, when a Joseph Day is listed at No. 4. Day, a mariner, had resided at No. 6 (No. 30) since 1866 and remained at No. 28 until 1879 at which time his wife Mary Ann is recorded as laundress and lessee. Mrs Day remained at No. 28 until 1882, when an Edward Day is listed, staying until 1895. No. 8 (No. 32) appears to have been operated continuously as grocery until 1880, when a bookbinder took up residence. In 1877 the properties were once again transferred, to George Rattray and William Henry Mackenzie as tenants in common. They retained ownership until 1884, when a Patrick Fahey purchased the properties. According to the Sands, Fahey, a grocer, had occupied No. 32 since 1882. He reinstated the grocery store and is listed at No. 32 until 1907 and continued to lease No. 28 and No. 30 to various tenants. At the turn of the century the plague hit Sydney and resulted in widespread cleansing and demolition in the older, more established parts of the city such as The Rocks. Fahey retained ownership of the properties until 1900, when notification of resumption was served. In 1901 the Sydney Harbour Trust was established to maintain and manage the area resumed by the Government. The Sands Directory indicates that the buildings remained continuously tenanted, with only short periods of vacancy. The area had long been associated with the lower classes and by this time had been transformed from industrial middle class occupancy to an area which had a reputation for crime and poor living conditions. In 1909 a Royal Commission for the Improvement of the City of Sydney recommended that Harrington Street, among others in The Rocks, be widened and straightened. It is not clear when, however, the level of Harrington Street was raised. This in turn necessitated the addition of two (descending) steps in the entrance of No. 30. In the early 1930s, the Maritime Services Board replaced the Sydney Harbour Trust as the landlords of The Rocks. Tenancy cards, dating from 1927, show that the buildings continued to be maintained and occupied by various tenants. The Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) was established in 1970, took responsibility and leased the buildings. The buildings continued to provide residential accommodation, however a shift away from residential use, to commercial use occurred during the next decade. In 1976 a shop selling old wares commenced operation in No. 28, with an associated tea room following in 1978. The Gumnut Tea Garden, began operation in No. 28 in . Nos. 30 and 32 retained residential tenants until 1984, and have subsequently been occupied by retail shops. =The well= It is unclear when the well was dug. Originally the land was part of the gardens behind the Assistant Surgeons House (incorrectly referred to as Assistant Surveyor on Meehan's survey of 1807). No wells are recorded on that plan, or on any other in the vicinity of the subject site. Wells were usually not recorded on maps and plans, so this is not an indication that it was not built at the time of Meehan's survey in 1807. There is no record of a structure on the subject site until when Reynolds built the one room cottages, possibly between 1823 and 1829. It is very likely that the well was dug during this period. Archaeological evidence suggests that the well was built in the first half of the nineteenth century. It contained artefacts that date before 1850 when the cottages were extended. Rooms were added to the back of the cottages at this time and two toilets erected over the well. The well was excavated by archaeologists in 1987 and in 1989-90 the rear yard and the subfloor of No. 30 as part of works to provide sub-floor ventilation and services for the site unearthed possible evidence of cock fighting and dog baiting - the latter using live cats.  Description  The facade of Nos. 28-30 Harrington Street typifies the symmetry and order of the Colonial Georgian style. The gabled roof, covered by galvanised iron sheeting and a shared brick chimney stack, centres the cottages. The walls are made of coarse sandstone rubble with raised pointing to simulate ashlar. There is clear evidence that these two cottages were built in separate stages due to the way the stone has been toothed at the party wall. Each cottage has a centrally placed entrance door of a simple, four panelled design with a brass door knob.

The Tamanrasset River is an enormous palaeoriver believed to have flowed through West Africa as recently as 5000 years ago. The Tamanrasset River basin is thought to have been comparable with the present-day Ganges-Brahmaputra river basin in Asia.  Tributaries  Western side: -Oued Saoura -Oued Namous Eastern side: -Oued Tamanraset   Overview The Tamanrasett is thought to have flowed across the Sahara in ancient times from sources in the southern Atlas mountains and Hoggar highlands in what is now Algeria. It is thought the river fed into the Cap Timiris Canyon, located off the coast of Mauritania, the canyon is located in waters three kilometres deep and is 2.5km wide in places. The presence of the river is thought to have had wide-ranging implications for human migration from Central Africa to the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Previously, the inhospitable Sahara desert was believed to have made a western route for migrating to Europe unviable. Researchers believe that the ancient river became active during the African Humid Period, climate oscillations caused by the Earth‚Äôs precessional orbit around the Sun. The palaeoriver was discovered using a Japanese orbital satellite system called Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). Using microwave sensing, PALSAR can see below Saharan sands and detect the fossil water still flowing.

She has been referred to as the most well-documented free colored woman in Cap-Francais of her generation. Brocard was a member of the free colored class in Saint-Domingue. She had two daughters with a white man, and appears to have belonged to the group of wealthy colored business women of the colony who had been a lover by placage to a white man, who left her with capital to start her own business after the termination of their relationship. In 1772, Brocard is noted to be an independent and rich businesswoman of note in the colony, and her business transactions are preserved to a large degree and the object of research. She was foremost a slave trader, whose main line of business was to buy and sell slaves from and to clients of the free colored class, mainly women. Brocard seemed to be involved not only in slave trade coming of incoming ships, but also of these born in the colony. The registries suggest that Brocard even sold slaves to free blacks living in Cap Fran√ßais. There is little information on her family, although it seems that she had two daughters, her first daughter was born when Simone was fifteen or sixteen, and even when there is no mention of a possible father, both are described as \\"quadroons,\\" daughters of a mulato woman and a white man.

It was designed by Varney Parkes and G. W. Landers and built from 1890 to 1907. It is currently known as the Sydney Futures Exchange. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The land that Royal Naval House stands on was once part of the western limit of the first Parade Ground of the Colony. Grosvenor Street was originally called Charlotte Place, named after Charlotte Sophia the wife of King George III. In 1897 the name of the street was changed to Grosvenor, afer the nearby Grosvenor Hotel (demolished in 1923) and itself named after the Grosvenor family. The renaming was very unpopular at the time. Earliest claimants to the site were William Davis and children of the late Robert and Anne Howe, grandchildren to George Howe, Government Printer and founder of Sydney's first newspaper, the Sydney Gazette. Fowles streetscapes from \\"Sydney in 1848\\" show substantial two storey houses along the site, these remained essentially unaltered until their demolition for Royal Naval House in 1889 and the other in 1907 for the later wing. By 1845 the Howe portion of the site was owned by Flower, Salting & Co and by 1849 by John Cleeve. Cleeve also owned the adjacent eastern block and remained in possession until . The 1890 section of Royal Naval House occupies the section of the site originally owned by William Davis, who was instrumental in helping the Catholic Church establish itself in NSW. John Samuel Shearston (1853-1916) was instrumental in the establishment of the Church of England Mission to Seamen in 1881, and his home a 3 Princes Street, Dawes Point was its headquarters. In 1885 he moved to larger premises at 9 Princes Street, renamed Trafalgar House, where they were also able to offer some residential accommodation. At the end of 1886, at its Committee's request, he agreed to also act as Superintendent of Goodenough Royal Naval House at 39 Princes Street, which he ran in conjunction with Trafalgar House. Despite this both places could not cope with the demand for accommodation and a public subscription was taken up to construct Royal Naval House in Grosvenor Street. Lord Carrington officially opened Royal Naval House in 1890. The land cost , the building , which was later extended, and the furnishings . Shearston resigned as Missioner to become Superintendent of Royal Naval House in September 1890. Mrs Shearston acted as housekeeper. The men, grateful for their warm welcome, soon referred to the premises as 'Johnny's', the name used by seamen until it closed in 1970. It was popular immediately and a newspaper report from the Sydney Mail, 21 August 1897 reported that in the last financial year the building had accommodated 25,789 men and in the seven years it had been opened 164,502 men had lodged there. Besides sleeping accommodation the building in 1897 also housed reading rooms dining rooms, billiard rooms and a gymnasium. By the end of the 19th century it was obvious that the building was too small. In 1904 the Government bought the adjacent site for the Trustees of Royal Naval House. The house illustrated in Fowles in 1848 remained essentially unchanged until demolition occurred for the erection of the 1907 wing of Royal Naval House. Evidence from Public Works Department indicates that the 1907 wing was built by the Government Architect's office. The Evening News of May 1912 reported that Royal Naval House had lodged 67,408 men in the last year, prior to the erection of the 1907 wing. Another 12,000 men used the House annually since the new section opened, averaging 216 men a night. At its busiest during World War II (1939-1945) Royal Naval House was accommodating almost 1500 men a night, many in \\"shakedowns\\" mattresses and bunks placed wherever there was room. In 1946 alone it lodged 307,000 sailors. Royal Naval House was used by naval personnel and in the 1960s by their families for temporary accommodation until it closed in 1970 and the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority took possession of the building in 1976. From 1980 negotiations proceeded with the private sector on proposals for mixed development and recycling on the land bounded by George, Grosvenor, Harrington and Essex Streets, known as Sites D5, D6 and D11. The agreement was signed for the Grosvenor Place project in June, 1983 involving the renovation of Royal Naval House and four adjacent buildings. Work on Grosvenor Place commenced in 1984 and was completed in 1988. In 1987, work commenced on the $12.5 million reconstruction and renovation of Royal Naval House and Federation Hall in Grosvenor Street to enable the buildings to house the Sydney Futures Exchange. The work involved the reinstatement of the original verandah and courtyard in a new location, and the restoration of the street facades. The reconstruction and renovation of the three remaining historic buildings on the site was carried out in 1989 for use as bars and restaurant.SCRA, Annual Reports, 1980-89.  Description  Style: Federation Free Classical; Storeys: Lower ground floor, three floors, plus attic. = Modifications and dates = *1939; 1945; 1952-1970 *Royal Naval House was built in 1889/90, designed by architect Varney Parkes, and added to by the Government Architect W L Vernon in 1907. Other interior modifications were carried out over the years, mainly post-1939. *In 1987-88 the reconstruction and renovation of this building and Federation Hall was undertaken for the Sydney Futures Exchange, involving the reinstatement of the original verandah and courtyard in a new location within the building and the restoration of the street facades.SCRA, Annual Report, 1987: 22.  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, Royal Naval House and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Royal Naval House has associations with William Davis, who once owned the land. Commodore James Goodenough, , the Commander of the Royal Navy's Australian Station in the late 19th century and John Shearston who were instrumental in establishing practical welfare for sailors when ashore. Shearston was the first superintendent of Royal Naval House and it was nicknamed \\"Johnnies\\" by sailors after him. Royal Naval House has social significance for thousands of Australian and British seamen who have lodged there in its more than 80 years of existence. As a group, the buildings (Federation Hall, Royal Naval House, Johnson's Building, 231 George Street and Brooklyn Hotel) have considerable significance. All facades contribute to the overall richness of the group, with Royal Naval House the focal point and the Johnson's Building leading nicely around the corner to a \\"coda\\" of two small but heavily textured facades which seem to be a logical end to the whole. The trees, which are deciduous, give an added quality to the richness of the facades and have considerable significance. The facades as a group have important landmark qualities with their location on the north-west corner of a major intersection, providing an entry point to The Rocks. The original facade of the Royal Naval House is a well-designed, rich and vigorous piece of architecture of the period, and the 1907 extension is well integrated with the original. A stucco facade of this richness is fairly rare in Sydney. The Stair Hall is distinguished more for its scale and boldness than its elegance, but nevertheless, it is well done and appropriate to the rest of the building. The other interior spaces are designed either as reading rooms or dormitories. As such, they are large open spaces with simple detailing, and therein is their virtue. The courtyard in the original form is a unique, appealing and intriguing space. It is almost as though Varney Parkes had designed a four- storey building with a verandah on the back, accessed by French doors, and then had been told to add a Dining Hall etc. on an awkward site. The solution admits lots of sunlight to the main building (considering the height) and soaks up the odd shape on the North-West corner.SCRA, 1982: 99-100, 103-104. High Significance Fabric: The Grosvenor Street facade and a considerable part of the return along Milson Lane, at least as far as the south wall of the courtyard. The interior spaces of the 1890 building (stair hall, full height). Courtyard including surrounding walls and verandahs. The roofscape. Medium Significance Fabric: Other rooms off Stair Hall on ground, first and second floors. Low Significance Fabric: Managers Quarters.

The Royal Naval House site has historical associations with William Davis, an Irish catholic transported for his part in the 1798 Rebellion, he was instrumental in helping the Catholic Church establish itself in Australia. Davis donated land for the first Catholic Church in Australia, St Patrick's in The Rocks, and also held services in his house, which was illegal. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Royal Naval House is associated with Commodore James Goodenough, (1830-1875). Goodenough was commander in charge of the Royal Navy's Australian Station, he was well liked and had strong charitable interests, especially among seamen. After his death Goodenough House was established to provide accommodation for Royal Navy sailors whilst ashore, this establishment lead directly to the construction of Royal Naval House. Royal Naval House is associated with John Samuel Shearston (1853-1916). Shearston was instrumental in the establishment of the Church of England Mission to Seamen in 1881, and his home a 3 Princes St, Dawes Point was its headquarters.

In 1889, Royal Naval House was erected and Shearston resigned as Missioner to become Superintendent of Royal Naval House in September 1890. Mrs Shearston acted as housekeeper. The men, grateful for their warm welcome, soon referred to the premises as 'Johnny's', by which they were known until closed in 1970. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. As a group, the buildings (Federation Hall, Royal Naval House, Johnson's Building, 231 George Street & Brooklyn Hotel) have considerable significance. All facades contribute to the overall richness of the group, with Royal Naval House the focal point and the Johnson's Building leading nicely around the corner to a \\"coda\\" of two small but heavily textured facades which seem to be a logical end to the whole. The trees, which are deciduous, give an added quality to the richness of the facades and have considerable significance. The facades as a group have important landmark qualities with their location on the north-west corner of a major intersection, providing an entry point to The Rocks. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Royal Naval House has significant social value especially to the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. It provided accommodation and meals for thousands of seaman for 82 years, and was known as \\"Johnnies\\" after the first superintendent John Shearston. So well known was Royal Naval House that the term \\"hissing in the snakepit\\" entered Naval slang to refer to the wet canteen located in the quadrangle at the centre of the building. During World War II Royal Naval House was accommodating up to 1500 sailors a night from the Australian, British and other allied Navies. After World War II the building was also used for overnight accommodation for the families of low ranking seamen who could not afford city hotel rates. Its social importance is demonstrated by articles that are still written about \\"Johnnies\\" in magazines and newspapers for those interested in nautical subjects such as \\"Afloat\\".

He vacated his seat when he succeeded to the peerage as Baron Ducie. Tortworth Court Moreton was the eldest son of Matthew Moreton, 1st Baron Ducie and his wife Arabella Prestwick, daughter of Sir Thomas Prestwick, 2nd Baronet, of Hulme, Lancashire. He was possibly educated at Harrow School. Moreton's father left the House of Commons in 1720 on being raised to the peerage and the son was elected Member of Parliament for Cricklade at a contested by-election on 1 February 1721. Thereafter, he voted consistently for the Administration. He was defeated by a single vote at the 1722 general election. He was then elected MP for Calne at another contested by-election on 28 February 1723, possibly on the interest of Walter Hungerford to whom he was related. He stood in a contest for Gloucester at the 1727 general election, but was caught up in a double return and waived his rights. The Administration brought him in for Tregony at a by-election on 6 February 1729. He was subsequently brought in for Lostwithiel at a further by- election in 31 Mar 1735. A month later on 2 May 1735, he succeeded to the peerage as Baron Ducie on the death of his father. When Walpole's government fell in 1742, Lord Ducie agreed to hold the office of surveyor of the petty customs in London in trust for Henry Bilson-Legge and Benjamin Keene, but in 1752 he asked to be relieved of it. In 1755 he was appointed Constable of St. Briavels, Warden of the Forest of Dean and Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire holding the posts to 1758, and High Steward of Gloucester which he held until 1766. He was unmarried and as his barony would become extinct, he was created Baron Ducie of Tortworth, on 27 April 1763 with a special remainder to the descent of his sister Elizabeth, who married Francis Reynolds. Lord Ducie. died unmarried in December 1770 and was succeeded by his nephew Thomas Reynolds, who adopted the name Moreton.

Career  Called to the bar in 1936, Fiennes carried out pupillages under F. E. Farrer and J. Neville Gray, and then practised privately before joining the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in 1939. His work there was considered essential to the war effort, sparing him from military service during the Second World War. From 1952 to 1958 and again from 1962 to 1966 he was responsible for drafting Finance Bills. He was appointed Second Parliamentary Counsel in 1956 and promoted to First Parliamentary Counsel in 1968, serving until retirement in 1972.

He spent a year away from the OPC from 1962 to 1963 to help draft Malaya's constitution. The Times called Fiennes \\"unquestionably the ablest draftsman of this century ... his amazing memory was stored with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the law and its history ... he was in the same class as his great Victorian predecessor Lord Thring\\". His ability to craft succinct legislation in plain language ‚Äì like the 1957 and 1972 acts ‚Äì was his strong point, although in some cases his subtle language also proved difficult to amend.

It was built from 1889 to 1891, with alterations designed by Scott and Green. It is also known as Exchange Courtyard and Meat Board Building. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  This site was originally at the western limit of the Parade Ground of the Colony and the commencement of the then unnamed [Grosvenor Street. The original claimant to the site was William Davis who owned extensive land holdings within The Rocks in the early years of the Colony. In 1848 the site with a simple two-storied Georgian residence erected upon it. Between 1887-89 demolition took place for the Royal Naval House site. It has been assumed here, from the evidence examined, that these buildings were all demolished in that period. Between 1889 and 1891 a three-storey brick and cement building with flat roof was erected on this site. This building with its plastered facade and pediment decoration forms the first three floors of the present building. The building was completed in 1891. It was built as a parish hall for t Patrick's Church and was used for that purpose until 1914. There were shops at ground level, which were leased by the parish to tenants. The property was sold by the parish in the 1920s. The early section was constructed as a series of shops to Grosvenor Street and a large space above with entry from Harrington Street known from as Federation Hall. From the Hall was known as the Repertory Theatre. In 1922 plans of proposed alterations and additions to 24-36 Grosvenor St were submitted to the City Council. The plans show the additions of two further floors and other modifications. Evidence from the Rate Assessment Books suggest that this work took place in 1923-24. The site was occupied by a number of organisations, including the newly formed NRMA from 1927‚Äì30 and F. W. Hughes from 1930.SCRA, 1982: 12-14 From 1980 negotiations proceeded with the private sector on proposals for mixed development and recycling on the land bounded by George, Grosvenor, Harrington and Essex Streets, known as Sites D5, D6 and D11. The agreement for the Grosvenor Place project was signed in June, 1983 involving the renovation of Royal Naval House and four adjacent buildings, including Federation Hall. Work on Grosvenor Place commenced in 1984 and was completed in 1988. In 1987, work commenced on the $12.5 million reconstruction and renovation of Royal Naval House and Federation Hall in Grosvenor Street to enable the buildings to house the Sydney Futures Exchange. The work involved the reinstatement of the original verandah and courtyard in a new location, and the restoration of the street facades. The reconstruction and renovation of the three remaining historic buildings on the site was carried out in 1989 for use as bars and restaurant.SCRA, Annual Reports, 1980-1989.

The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right.

The work was created , and depicts a swirl of stormy sea waves. It has been in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, since 1926, when it was acquired with financial support from the Fletcher Fund. Background Throughout the history of Japanese art, many artists have sought to convey in their works the fleeting state of rolling sea waves. The theme has been depicted not only on emakimono (handscrolls) and silk, but also on fans, by≈çbu and decor items. Description Ogata's painting Rough Waves is the most important image of the unapproachable sea elements to be created in Japanese painting before Hokusai's The Great Wave off Kanagawa. To create it, Ogata used an ancient Chinese technique of drawing with two brushes, held together in one hand. The materials Ogata used for the painting were ink, paint and gilded paper. He conveyed the threatening and dangerous nature of the waves with the help of elongated and contrastingly contoured, finger- or dragon-claw-like wave crests and sea foam. The expressiveness of the work appears to be unusual for Ogata, with the main means of expression being the use of lines created by ink. The screen on which Rough Waves was painted bears the seal ‚ÄúD≈çs≈´‚Äù, a pseudonym that Ogata used from 1704. Recent studies show that Ogata created the painting between 1704 and 1709, during the transitional period in his career when he lived in the city of Edo (now Tokyo). The works of the artist during this period are characterized by a strong influence of the creativity of representatives of the Kan≈ç school. The direct source of inspiration for Rough Waves may have been the work of the artist Sesson Shukei (), whose still-extant paintings include a number of dynamic and mysterious images of sea waves, among them Egret, Moon, and Wave and The Wind and the Waves. Rough Waves also reflects the influence of Tawaraya S≈çtatsu, who specialized in gloomy landscapes, but is nevertheless an independent interpretation by Ogata of the frightening and violent force of the sea. Influence Rough Waves impressed Ogata‚Äôs follower Sakai H≈çitsu, who in 1805 created his work Waves, in which he tried to convey a similar frightening atmosphere and a premonition of danger. At some time in the past, H≈çitsu's family had commissioned work from Ogata, and so a collection of Ogata's pictures was available for H≈çitsu to study in detail. The images in Waves, created in ink on silver-plated paper, were more abstract than those in Ogata's work, but retained their demonic character.

He is the Secretary-Treasurer of the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences and Senior Associate Editor for the journal Personality and Individual Differences. His work has been published in various scientific journals, encyclopedias, and has been covered in major media outlets.  Contributions  Petrides is internationally recognized for his theory of trait emotional intelligence, but also for his contributions to psychometrics and personality theory (including publications with psychologist Hans J. Eysenck) as well as for the family of TEIQue psychometric instruments. In addition to trait emotional intelligence theory, he has developed belief-importance (belimp) theory. Petrides is a prominent advocate for the use of introspection and self-report measurement in psychological research. He considers these as the only methodological approaches that allow for observational contact with inner mental life and hence absolutely essential for the investigation of psychological phenomena. Petrides's various theories (including trait emotional intelligence and belief-importance theory) are all fully expanded and integrated within the grand system of Psychobionomy. The term Psychobionomy is derived from the Greek words ‚ÄòPsyche,‚Äô which means soul or spirit, ‚ÄòBio,‚Äô which means life, and the suffix ‚Äò-nomy,‚Äô which means law. Psychobionomy can be classified as an ontological system within Philosophy of Mind aiming to discover and apply the essential laws of mind for the betterment of human psychology and life as a whole.  Key ideas  Central across Petrides‚Äô theories is the notion that perceptions, in general, and self-perceptions, more specifically, have a creative influence on a person's life. The reality that people experience at any point in time is a function of how they perceive themselves and life, more broadly. By changing their perceptions, they can purposely effect desirable change in all areas of their lives. A full biographical entry can be found in Springer's Encyclopedia of Individual Differences.

After the early death of his father, he spent his childhood with the maternal grandparents in St. Petersburg, Russia. He attended high school in Stuttgart, where he had his first drawing lessons, and then studied painting at the Karlsruhe Academy of Fine Arts under Hans Fredrik Gude. In the years 1880-1881 he visited a number of Arab countries with fellow artists Eugen Bracht and Carl Coven Schirm. Among other places, he visited St. Catherine's Monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai, which he recorded in oils. In addition to landscapes, he painted a number of oriental scenes. On his return he was initially based in Karlsruhe, but then moved back to Berlin in 1892. Back in Berlin Meckel was represented regularly at the exhibitions of the Academy of Arts, Berlin and the Great Berlin Art Exhibitions, as well as in the Munich Glass Palace, Dresden, Stuttgart and Vienna. A list of over 100 of Meckel's works was catalogued by F. von Boetticher. Meckel attended the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in 1893 with four paintings, but a fifth was rejected.

It was built from 1914 to 1915. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site occupied by 231 George Street was over part of the original Parade Ground of the Colony. The land was claimed by Robert Howe on the basis of a land grant promised to his father by Governor Macquarie. Robert Howe and the Sydney Gazette Office occupied premises which had street frontages both to George and Grosvenor Streets from 1824-28. By 1848 the original grant fronting George Street comprised 'Mr Dawson's' house, a passage and the first of a series of terraced shops and houses. Mr Dawson, watch and chronometer maker, occupied the house from 1848 until . The house remained essentially unaltered until demolition commenced in 1911/12 for the widening of George Street. While the new Brooklyn Hotel and Chamber of Commerce building were completed by the end of 1912, this site remained vacant for that year, housing the temporary bar of the Brooklyn. Early in 1915 the site was rated by the City Council as \\"land\\". Later in the same year the State Metal Quarries are listed as tenants of a four-storey brick structure with an iron roof. Thus, 231 George Street was probably erected in 1914 or 1915.SCRA 1982: 8-12 From 1980 negotiations proceeded with the private sector on proposals for mixed development and recycling on the land bounded by George, Grosvenor, Harrington and Essex Streets, known as Sites D5, D6 and D11. The agreement for the Grosvenor Place project was signed in June 1983 involving the renovation of Royal Naval House and four adjacent buildings, including 231 George Street. Work on Grosvenor Place commenced in 1984 and was completed in 1988. In 1987 work commenced on the $12.5 million reconstruction and renovation of Royal Naval House and Federation Hall in Grosvenor Street to enable the buildings to house the Sydney Futures Exchange. The reconstruction and renovation of the three remaining historic buildings on the site, including 231 George Street, was carried out in 1989 for use as bars and restaurant.SCRA Annual Reports 1980-1989  Description  231 George Street is a narrow frontage four-storey office building which infills the space between the Johnson's Building and the Brooklyn Hotel. It is a brick and sandstone building with a projecting bay window and triangular chequerboard pediment at roof level. Style: Federation Free Classical; Storeys: Four; Roof Cladding: Iron; Floor Frame: Timber. The building was extensively reconstructed in 1989, with only the fa√ßade of the building remaining of the original fabric. = Modifications and dates = In the late 1980s, major work was undertaken to the group of buildings to enable their reuse. The street facades, including awnings and shop fronts, were conserved. The interiors of the buildings were extensively modified.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, This commercial building and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. As a group, the buildings (Federation Hall, Royal Naval House, Johnson's Building, 231 George Street and Brooklyn Hotel) have considerable significance. All facades contribute to the overall richness of the group, with Royal Naval House the focal point and the Johnson's Building leading nicely around the corner to a \\"coda\\" of two small but heavily textured facades which seem to be a logical end to the whole. The trees, which are deciduous, give an added quality to the richness of the facades and have considerable significance. The facades as a group have important landmark qualities with their location on the north-west corner of a major intersection, providing an entry point to The Rocks. 231 George Street is an Edwardian building completed in the Federation Free Style, presenting a very tall, narrow fa√ßade to George Street and providing a link, in style and materials, between the Johnson's Building and the Brooklyn Hotel. Its projecting bay, arched at the top, with a triangular pediment in a chequerboard design, makes a significant contribution to the landmark quality of the corner grouping.SCRA 1982: 99-100, 105; National Trust listing 1981 Commercial building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. This commercial building and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The site was once part of the original Parade Ground of the Colony and the site's changing use reflects the urban, economic and social development of the area from the very early days of the colony to the present. The redevelopment of the site in the late 20th century is a demonstration of the compromises that were made to accommodate new development. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 231 George Street: This Edwardian building is in Federation Free Style, presenting a very tall, narrow fa√ßade to George Street and providing a link, in style and materials, between the Johnson's Building and the Brooklyn Hotel. Its projecting bay, arched at the top, with a triangular pediment in a chequerboard design, makes a significant contribution to the landmark quality of the corner grouping. As a group, the buildings (Federation Hall, Royal Naval House, Johnson's Building, 231 George Street & Brooklyn Hotel) have considerable significance. All facades contribute to the overall richness of the group, with Royal Naval House the focal point and the Johnson's Building leading nicely around the corner to a \\"coda\\" of two small but heavily textured facades which seem to be a logical end to the whole. The trees, which are deciduous, give an added quality to the richness of the facades and have considerable significance. The facades as a group have important landmark qualities with their location on the north-west corner of a major intersection, providing an entry point to The Rocks. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The redevelopment of the site and the reconstruction of the building in 1989 has left the fa√ßade as the only original fabric. There was extensive excavation below the building. Therefore, the archaeological resource has been destroyed and the site has low potential for archaeological research. The site still retains value for other areas of research such as changing architectural styles and adaptive reuse.

Western Restaurant Nekoya=Main Staff= ; : :The owner of the Western Restaurant Nekoya. A single man in his middle age, he is the grandchild of a couple who opened the restaurant, and inherited it when his grandfather died 10 years ago. An outstanding culinary master, he enjoys cooking for the eclectic group of patrons that visit every Saturday. Resulting from the mingling of so many diverse beings within one space, the restaurant has become a neutral region, since none of the guests ‚Äî whatever their personal differences ‚Äî want to miss out on the Master's cuisine. His grandmother, Koyomi (also known as Yomi, a heroine from the other world) entrusted him with the key to the door; should he decide to close the door between both worlds, he is told that he must break the key. It is implied that he's not fully human and possess a demi-human bloodline. ; : :A demon girl hailing from the Demon Kingdom on the other world's Eastern Continent. When the Demon God was vanquished by the legendary Four Heroes, the power he had once bestowed upon his demonic subjects waned, and as a result Aletta was born no different from humans except for the goat horns on her head. Rejected by the human world and ending up a vagrant, she discovered the Nekoya's interdimensional entrance and began working every Saturday as a waitress. She later finds additional work as Sarah Gold's housekeeper. ; : :One of the other world's six ancient dragons imbued with death, a power which inadvertently killed every mortal being that happened to cross her path. To avoid killing innocents, she banished herself to the world's shattered moon. By chance, she found the door of the Nekoya appearing in her vicinity, entered the restaurant and, naive to human customs owing to her long isolation, ended up consuming so much chicken curry that her old friend, the \\"Red Queen\\", prompted the Master to hire her as a waitress to pay off her food bill. To interact with the staff and patrons, \\"Kuro\\" adopts the form of a black-haired elf girl, but usually communicates via telepathy instead of speaking aloud. Later, she was taught how to speak vocally to prevent others from freaking out. She unofficially serves as the restaurant's guardian, should a situation escalate. Of the diners, only Altorius and Alexander are aware of her true identity. ; : :The now-deceased previous owner of the Nekoya and the current Master's grandfather. He is shown in flashbacks when the Master reflects upon the older customers who became his grandfather's regulars. He gave the restaurant to Master, who was also his apprentice. He met Koyomi near the end (or just after) World War II; Yomi would serve as a waitress, and the two eventually fell in love. ; : :A female warrior from the other world, and a member of the legendary Four Heroes. During their battle with the Demon God over seventy years ago, she fell through an interdimensional wormhole and wound up on Earth, where she married the Master's grandfather and ran the Nekoya with him. Initially, only Altorius, one of her comrades, knew about this secret. According to him, she is still alive on Earth despite her advanced age and visits her grandson from time to time. Furthermore, its implied she retains some of her magical ability. She holds the key to permanently stop doors to warp and a fail-safe, but decided to entrust it to her grandson, seeing what progress the restaurant has become; should her grandson decide to close the door, he must break the key. =Restaurant Support= Individuals from Japan, who are friends with the current Master. They help supply the restaurant with ingredients; some of them are actually aware of Western Restaurants Nekoya's otherworldly secret. ;The Flying Puppy Owner :He is the second owner of the Flying Puppy Bakery, who supplies Western Restaurant Nekoya with a variety of cookies, cakes, and other deserts. He is aware of Nekoya's secret and helps the restaurant as much as he can. The bakery itself is located just above the restaurant, allowing easy access by the Master should he need anything. ;Shouta Kimura :The bread delivery boy from Kimura Bakery, who delivers Western Restaurant Nekoya's bread supply; he works under his father, Kimura Bakery's owner. He ponders why Western Restaurant Nekoya requests for bread restock on Saturday's despite knowing the restaurant is closed. He is shown to have a crush on Aletta, who he assumes is a foreign cosplayer. The Regulars from the Other World The regular patrons call each other nicknames based on their favorite Nekoya dishes. ; : :An elderly sage and magician, and one of the famous Four Heroes of the Eastern Continent. He is responsible for translating the Nekoya main menu entries into his world's language. His former pupil, the half-elf sorceress Victoria (see below), is also a regular at the Nekoya. ; : :A legendary wandering swordsmaster from the Western Continent's Land of Mountains, which boasts a culture similar to medieval Japan. He is good friends with Altorius, despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that they often end up arguing about which of their respective favorite dishes is better than the other. ; : :A female shapeshifting red dragon who is over 100,000 years old, and one of the six ancient dragons in the other world. When visiting the restaurant ‚Äî whose door opens right onto her mountain lair ‚Äî she adopts the form of a voluptuous, red-haired human woman, with large horns sprouting from her head; to avoid conflict, she arrives only after the other diners have all left. She was already a regular patron in the old owner's time, and because of both her natural avarice and her particular fondness for the Master's beef stew, she considers the Nekoya and its staff her personal \\"treasure\\", to the point of blessing Aletta and trying to overpay the beef stew with a pot full of coins. ; : :Sarah, a resident of the Demon Kingdom, is a member of the influential Gold merchant family and great-grand daughter of the deceased legendary treasure hunter, William Gold. Infected by adventure lust (which is regarded as a curse within her family), she became a professional treasure hunter herself, and following William's descriptions to his personal door to the Nekoya in an abandoned mine, she gets to enjoy the Master's Minced Meat Cutlet, which was William's favorite dish. In the course of her visits to the Nekoya, she also becomes personally close to Heinrich Seeleman, trading friendly barbs with him. ; : :A nobleman from the Eastern Continent's great Duchy of Samanark who is obsessed with fried shrimp, whose taste he has not enjoyed since he left his childhood sea town to become a knight. After having stumbled upon the Nekoya in the course of a vital mission, and after having learned about how to return to this place, he has become an avid consumer of its fried shrimp dish. On the occasions of his visits, he also becomes closely acquainted with Sarah Gold. ; : :An admiral of the Samanark duchal navy who was shipwrecked by a Kraken attack while escorting a merchant fleet, and stranded on a lonely tropical island for twenty years. On the island, Fl√ºgel discovered a door to the Nekoya, which was then still run by the Master's grandfather, and has been sustaining himself on the Master's curry rice and the company he found there. After being rescued, he manages to locate an alternative door to the restaurant and indulge himself on his favorite dish once more. ; : :The former owner of a food supplying company in the other world, specializing in pasta dishes, which have become a popular cuisine in his kingdom. His inspiration actually stems from his monthly business interaction with the Nekoya restaurant, whose door opens right into his company's cellar. In turn for the restaurant's Day of Satur income and a free serving of spaghetti with meat sauce, Thomas supplies the Master with exclusive ingredients from the other world in order to adjust his dishes to his Saturday customers' tastes. In exchange, he has copied the pasta menu and its ingredients, and sells it on the other side. ; : :Thomas Alfade's grandson, who is entrusted with his grandfather's secret upon his first visit to Nekoya in order to succeed Thomas as the head of the Alfade Company. Like his grandfather, he has also become quite fond of the Nekoya Meat Sauce Pasta. ; Johnathan Winsberg :Sirius Alfade's childhood friend and personal chef; because Sirius is unable to analyze taste like his grandfather, he decided to take Jonathan with him to Western Restaurant Nekoya. Once there, he discovers the restaurants Italian style dishes, with Sirius requesting if it is possible for him to replicate the dishes with the ingredients from their world. He takes a liking to the restaurant's Neapolitan pizza. ; : :The young princess of the Great Empire on the other world's Eastern Continent named after her great-grandmother, who is often sent by her parents to her grandfather's country estate for her health, since she is suffering from an incurable disease known as the \\"Pauper Killer disease\\" (the actual nature is left unspecified, but her symptoms imply it to be asthma). Her late grandfather took her to the Nekoya during one of her visits as a young child, during which she came to enjoy the Master's chocolate parfait, making her another regular. ; : :The founder and first ruler of the Great Empire. He is also Adelheid's late grandfather, whom he on her last visit before his demise took to the Nekoya to alleviate her loneliness from being away from her family. He is also the son of Alexander, one of the four great heroes. He was nicknamed after his passion for the restaurant's croquettes. ; : :One of the old owner's oldest patrons, Lionel is a powerful lion demon warrior from the Demon Kingdom and the former leader of a raider gang who was captured by the half-elf hero Alexander and seemed destined to end his days as a gladiator slave. (In the manga, he was defeated by Alexander in exchange of all Lionel's riches; in the anime, he was betrayed by the Demon Lord because of his detrimental attitude.) He was spared this fate when the Nekoya door incidentally appeared right inside his holding cell. After having been strengthened by the food he was served there, he won his freedom in less than a year (a feat never before accomplished) and stayed on as a gladiator champion, ever since returning to partake in the Nekoya's pork cutlet rice bowl dish for the past twenty years. ; : :A lizardman hailing from the marshlands of the most southeastern tip of the other world's Eastern Continent. Already an adult at the age of eight years, he is a veteran hunter and warrior among his hunter-gatherer tribe, the Blue Tails. His tribe was visited by the Nekoya door about thirty years ago; and as a result of its wondrous appearance and the delicious food found on the other side, the site where the door appears is now a sacred spot for the tribe, who sends its worthiest champion through the door every Saturday to bring back some of the restaurant's omelette rice for the tribe to enjoy. As champion, Gaganpo is entitled to eat his own share inside the shop, a luxury that motivates him to consistently be the champion of his tribe. ; / : :A young female wood elf who is a half-orphan and doted on by her constantly worried father. While gathering ingredients for dinner, she discovered the door to the Nekoya, and when the restaurant's usual menu did not appeal to her due to her vegan disposition, the Master created a tofu steak dish especially for her. After enjoying its taste, she has become very eager to learn all she can about creating culinary delights in order not to let Elven cuisine lose out to humanity's culinary skills. ; : :A member of the ancient duchal Samanark family of the Eastern Continent, Victoria manifested a latent half- elven genetic strain running in her family line which rendered her an outcast in human and elven society; she became known as the reclusive \\"Witch of the Western Tower\\" and \\"The Duchy's Witch Princess\\". After discovering and developing her natural aptitude at sorcery, she became the star pupil of the sage Altorius and first visited the Nekoya in his company, where she became responsible for writing up the dessert menu. In order to store her stash of take-out pudding, she has invented a magical equivalent for a powered icebox. She began taking her niece and nephew (neither of whom appear in the anime) with her to Nekoya when she discovered the two of them snooping in her room. ; : :Arte is a young mermaid from the other world's southern seas, and a priestess of the of the seas (hinted to be , one of the other world's six ancient dragons). Thanks to her magic, she is able to change her fins into dragon feet, which enables her to visit the Nekoya. ; : :A young fisherman who was caught by surprise by a storm at sea, but rescued from drowning by Arte. In repayment for his salvation, Arte asked him for some money to pay for her favorite dish at the Nekoya, Hamburg steak. After accompanying her to the restaurant, Roukei has become very fond of both Arte and the hamburg steak himself. ; / \\"Whiskey\\" : :Guilhem is a dwarf brewer who once happened to stumble upon the Nekoya and developed a passion for its fried seafood dishes and alcoholic beverages. After introducing his initially sceptical friend Gard, a glassmith, to these exotic delicacies, the two of them establish a waystation and an inn at the site where the Nekoya door appears, but retain exclusive access to the interdimensional door for themselves. ; : :The young prince of the Western Continent's magical Land of Sand and a trained sorcerer. He has a crush on Princess Adelheid, which is his prime reason for visiting the Nekoya, but lacks the courage to confess his feelings to her. Due to his fondness for the restaurant's chilled coffee, he and his sister introduced the drink to their nation, where it has become a highly popular treat. ; : :Shareef's younger half-sister by a sorceress who married their father and trained them both in the magic arts. She tries to support her brother in pursuing his affections for the Eastern Empire's princess, but is exasperated by his inability to even speak to her face to face. At the Nekoya, she particularly loves the soft serve floats. ; / \\"Fruit Crepe\\" : :She is a Fairy and the Queen of the Land of Flowers. After the Nekoya door appeared in her kingdom, she regularly takes a selected group of her subjects to the restaurant to partake in its fruit cr√™pes. ; / \\"Natto Spaghetti\\" : :A wood elf and friend of Fardania's father Edmond, Christian is a knowledgeable traveler who, following his own encounter with the Nekoya, has taken an interest in human food preparation techniques and tries to adapt them to the Elven cuisine. He is especially proud of having replicated miso and tofu using Elven beans. ; / \\"Carpaccio\\" : :A mated pair of juvenile Sirens from the Continental Sea between the other world's Eastern and Western Continent. While Arius is knowledgeable but shy, Iris is the more vigorous and impulsive of the two. After finding the Nekoya door on the island where Alphonse Fl√ºgel was stranded for twenty years, they have settled on the island for their regular visits to the restaurant to enjoy its carpaccio. ;Celestina / \\"Pound Cake\\" :She's the Eastern Continent's youngest High Priestess. She serves the Goddess of Light and preaches moderation. However, she has trouble following her beliefs as the Western Restaurant Nekoya's door appears within her training grounds. Once in the restaurant, she indulgences in various types of pound cake provided by the Flying Puppy Bakery, who sees her as one of the bakery's best customers. ;Romero and Julietta / \\"Wine\\" :They are a fugitive Dark Retainer couple. The two are on the run from Julietta's father, a nobleman who wanted to punish Romero for making his daughter into his \\"plaything.\\" However, Julietta allowed herself to be converted by Romero because her strong love for him made her wanting to stay with him forever. They stumbled upon Western Restaurant Nekoya while on the run, and soon fell in love with both its food and wine; they see the restaurant as a form of salvation, despite several customers - Altorius, a mage; Heinrich, a knight; and Celestina, a high priestess - being sworn enemies of Dark Retainers (in fact, Celestina merely gets annoyed by the couple's doting). The couple's name (and overall situation) is a play off of Romeo and Juliet. ;Pikke and Pakke / \\"Cream Croquette\\" :A pair of halflings who travel the world, selling stew made with \\"knight sauce\\" and always make sure that they manage to find a location where the \\"Door of Nekoya\\" appears every Day of Satur. ;Ellen and Herman / \\"Daily Special\\" :A married couple who visit Nekoya with their children, Kai and Bona once a month for a small treat, which they had been doing for fifteen years. Every time they visit, they order the daily special due to their limited budget, allowing them to try a different dish every time, with one example being Ham Cutlets ;Fairey / \\"Karubidon\\" :The 14-year-old high-born, mixed-blood daughter of a princess from the Eastern Continent, who resides with her family in the Ocean Nation and visits Nekoya once every few months due to her overlapping schedule. During her visits, she disguises herself as a commoner in order to hide her identity as a princess, allowing her to enjoy her favorite dish, Karubidon however she pleases. ;Tatsuji and Otora / \\"Roast Chicken\\" :An Ogre Couple from the Western Continent who learn of the Restaurant Nekoya from the halfling, Rat, after he convinces them to let him go due to being captured by them. Once there, they develop a fondness for the many varieties of Roast Chicken they serve, as well as their alcohol. ;Touichirou / \\"Hot Dogs\\" :A Swordsman who grew up in a tiny town, abandoned his status as his family's heir and crossed the Eastern Continent with his wife, Aya, a Priestess of the Lord of Earth and daughter of a senior priest. Though the two of them are quite fond of the resatraunt's Hot Dogs, for the time being, Aya remains unable to leave the house due to having to take care of their newborn child, thus Touichirou has taken up the task to go Nekoya and bring takeout home with him. ;Alisa and Meimei / \\"Mushroom Spaghetti\\" :Two best friends who enter through separate doors and meet up inside Nekoya and share a mutual fondness for Mushroom Spaghetti. While Alisa is a talented Elf Healer, who lived in a nameless village in the middle of a forest, Meimei is a young, orphaned demon girl with large white goat horns, and lives on a farm in the Ocean Nation. During their visits, they spend their time catching up with each other and trading their different variations of the Mushroom Spaghetti so that the pair of them could enjoy them. ;Aisha / \\"Seafood Pilaf\\" :A young noblewoman who hails from the Desert nation in the Western Continent, who was first introduced to Nekoya by her servant, Alfred. Though at first scared by the monster diners that also visited the restaurant, she quickly calms down and develops a liking to the dish made with rice and seafood, known as Seafood Pilaf. Others ; : :A womanizing half-elf mercenary and sword-master, and along with Altorius one of the legendary Four Heroes. He's described as being sharp-tongued and overconfident, despite having good intentions. After his exploits ended with the defeat of the Demon God, he spent 70 years as a mercenary performing work on commission. One of these jobs involved capturing Lionel and his band of mercenaries (an action that later required him to stagger his time visiting Nekoya to avoid meeting him). He is also father of Wilhelm, the founder of the Eastern Continent's Empire. Their relationship apparently suffered due to Alexander being absent in his sons' life, being away at war while he grew up and missing the death of his lover. Upon visiting the restaurant and trying his sons' favorite dish, he visits his grave, meeting his great-granddaughter Adelheid (named for her great-grandmother) but deciding not to reveal himself to her. ; : :The \\"Red Queen\\"'s demonic valet, who resides with her in her mountaintop nest. Despite his appearance, he is incredibly polite and reserved. ; : :Sarah Gold's younger sister who has remained a proper young lady of the upper society, although she cares very much about her older sister and visits her from time to time. She also manages their family's businesses. While she does not visit the Nekoya personally, she comes to enjoy the cookies the Master has received from Flying Puppy, a bakery shop acquaintance of his and which were originally served to her by Aletta. ; : :Fardania's father, who lost his wife Matilda when Fardania was still young. A doting father to his only child, he hesitatingly tried to prevent his daughter from exploring the world. ; Rat : A halfling who, to his own embarrassment once attempted to dine and dash after visiting Nekoya for the first time, since then he has been officially barred and is unable to pass through the door that appears on every Day of Satur. However he is able to exploit a small loophole by following other diners into the restaurant so long as they open the door first, one such example being when he introduced the Orge Couple, Tatsuji and Otora to the restaurant after he was captured by them, in order to avoid being eaten by them.

Life James McCurry, one of six children of John and Isabella McCurry, was born in 1830, in Carrowclare, County Londonderry. He was blind from birth. He married Elizabeth Forrest, but she died not long after their marriage. Their only child, a daughter, died at the age of twelve. Jimmy lived to the age of 80, dying in the Limavady workhouse on 26 October 1910. Three days later he was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of Tamlaght Finlagan Parish Church. Repertoire None of his songs was transcribed or recorded in his lifetime, but three were published by Sam Henry in the Northern Constitution in the 1920s. These and several other songs survived in the repertoires of later local singers, such as John Fleming and Eddie Butcher, and were recorded on tape between 1954 and 1975 by Hugh Shields. These recordings are now held by the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum and in the Hugh Shield Collection at the Irish Traditional Music Archive. There is clear element of satire in his songs, aimed at people whom his audience would have known. The many personal allusions, are, \\"if not malicious, at least intended to raise a laugh at the expense of the persons named.\\" The Londonderry Air Local tradition now identifies Jimmy as the musician whose performance in Limavady of the Londonderry Air, the melody of Danny Boy, was heard and transcribed by Jane Ross in 1851.

The parkland of 38.9ha (96 acres) extends to the north-east and south-east of the house. Lying close to the village of Aldourie, it originally consisted of a rectangular main block, with a round tower at the south-west corner. In the 1860s, William Fraser-Tytler extended the castle in all directions, including a balustraded round tower, oriel windows, scroll-sided dormers, turrets, corbels, rope- moulded stringing and gunloops. It underwent extensive restoration work between 2002 and 2010, and again in 2017, when the original walled Victorian kitchen garden and surrounding grounds were revived, with help from students from the National Trust for Scotland. The gardens and parkland are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.  History  Aldourie Castle, landward side Aldourie Castle on Loch Ness was first recorded as a laird‚Äôs house in 1625 as a property of Mackintosh of Kyllachy in Nairnside. Lying close to the small, crofting village of Aldourie, it originally consisted of a rectangular main block, with a round tower at the south-west corner, and was extended to the west in 1839 with a two-storey wing. In the 1860s, William Fraser-Tytler was responsible for transforming Aldourie into the historic castle it is today. He commissioned Mackenzie & Matthews to extend the house ‚Äúin all directions, parading the full repertoire of early 17th-century baronialism, including a balustraded round tower cribbed from Castle Fraser, Grampian, oriel windows, scroll-sided steeply pedimented dormers, candle-snuffered turrets, corbelling, rope-moulded stringcourses and gunloops‚Äù. Further additions in 1902-4 by Sir Robert Lorimer included a wing at the south-east. Aldourie Castle on the banks of Loch Ness In 1893, the British army unit the Lovat Scouts were reputedly founded at Aldourie by Lord Lovat and Edward Fraser-Tytler. In 2015 Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen bought the castle for ¬£15m as part of his portfolio of 12 Scottish estates making him the largest landowner in Scotland. The castle is available to rent.  Geography  Aldourie Castle is situated on Strath Dores, between the southern banks of Loch Ness and the Glen leading onto Drumashie Moor. Aldourie Castle is set on a level terrace above the loch, with its main lawn facing north-west out onto the loch and the slopes of Creag Dherag. The parkland of 38.9ha (96 acres) extends to the north-east and south-east of the house and is enclosed by woodland. South of the parkland, a series of agricultural fields are enclosed by a regular pattern of shelterbelts, screening Aldourie Farm. The extent of the parkland remains unchanged since the mid 19th century.1870-71 survey, 1st edition OS 1:10560 (6\\"), published 1875  Present Day  Alpine Fellows at Aldourie Castle, 2014 Aldourie Castle is now classed as the only inhabitable castle on Loch Ness and it is now used primarily for private use castle stays. On site activities include clay pigeon shooting, archery and chartered boat tours. Now a Category A listed building in Scotland, Aldourie Castle underwent extensive restoration work between 2002 and 2010 to restore specialist paintwork, murals and metalwork fixtures throughout the Castle. An Estate Conservation Project started in 2017 to revive the original walled Victorian kitchen garden and surrounding grounds with help from students from the National Trust for Scotland.

The band‚Äôs current line-up consists of Varun Rajput (Lead Vocals and Guitars), Joshua Peter (Vocals and Keyboards), Shrikant Biswakarma (Guitars and Vocals) and Dan Thomas (Drums). History From 2006 to 2008, during their college days, Varun Rajput and Mridul Ganesh (Former singer of the band) used to play in a local Progressive Rock band called Feedback, with Gurtej Singh (Former guitar player) playing for Prestorika around the same time. However, music took a back seat as they ventured into the corporate world. A few years later, both Mridul and Varun decided to quit their management consulting jobs around the same time in 2012 to work on more creative projects. During this time Varun and Gurtej also had been having conversations about starting a new project and were longing to get back to music. The three of them then decided to get together to work on some tunes. It wasn't long when they had already written 3 songs and were ready to take this even further. They released their first song ‚ÄòDheere Dheere‚Äô in January 2013, which was appreciated by a variety of audience. This propelled the trio to record a full length album and find a drummer and a bass player to begin playing live. Soon the hunt for a drummer and a bass player began during which they came across Vipul, through a mutual friend. Vipul Malhotra (Former drummer) was studying at NSIT at that time and was a great fit into the set-up. Finally, Varun asked his friend Raghav Verma (Former bass player) to join the team. With the setup finally complete, they decided to take the plunge to record and produce an album during the summer of 2013 for their new band ‚ÄòAntariksh‚Äô.

Toomer's Corner consists of two landmarks, the Bank of Auburn and Toomer's Drugs Pharmacy, the latter of which, at one time, was the only place with a telegraph machine. The employees at Toomer's Drugs, after discovering that Auburn had won a game, would throw the ticker tape onto the power lines to signify so. The area's primary source of popularity comes from an Auburn tradition that arose over a century ago and has not ceased over the years in bringing people nearby to the landmark.  History and tradition  A night for celebration on Toomer's Corner Toomer's Corner gets its name from a businessman and former State Senator Sheldon Toomer, who happened to be a halfback for Auburn's first football team. Toomer founded Toomer's Drugs in 1896, which was started with a $500 loan from John Reese, and Toomer later founded the Bank of Auburn on the corner of Magnolia Avenue and College Street in 1907. The pharmacy was later sold in 1952 by Toomer to Mac and Elizabeth Lipscomb, who chose against renaming the pharmacy. In 1962 Auburn fans and students began to celebrate away games by covering the power lines outside of the pharmacy and the trees directly opposite with toilet paper. There is much controversy over when \\"rolling the corner\\" became a celebration for all things Auburn. It is theorized by David Housel that it truly began in 1972 when Auburn's football team won a victory against rival Alabama. The rolling of the corner was initially set off by the employees that worked at Toomer's Drugs pharmacy using an inventive way to signal a victory for Auburn while playing away games; they would throw the ticker tape from the telegraph onto the power lines outside of the store. In 1984, the drug store was sold to Mark Morgan. Five years after the selling of the store to Morgan, the Iron Bowl made its first stop in Auburn and was one of the first times Toomer's Corner was covered with endless rolls of toilet paper. The store has been resold a couple of times in the 1990s but the tradition that Toomer's Corner sparked has remained. The power lines have since been relocated under the ground but Auburn's tradition of rolling the trees never slowed. As of 2019, Toomer's Corner continues to bring fans, residents, and even visitors of Auburn around the historic corner. Vandalism Toomer's Corner after the poisoned trees had been removed and the area placed under 24-hour surveillanceToomer's Drugs pharmacy on Toomer's Corner.The oak trees used to celebrate have been vandalized on multiple occasions. In 2010 the trees were poisoned using a herbicide called Spike 80DF. Two months later the perpetrator later called the Paul Finebaum sports radio talk show on January 27, 2011, to confess his actions, which were presumed to have been driven by Alabama's loss the previous week in the Iron Bowl against the Auburn Tigers in 2010. The phone call was tracked and the perpetrator, Harvey Updyke was arrested.

After the trees were poisoned, efforts were made to save the trees but were unsuccessful. The corner was eventually redone entirely with untainted soil and replanted with two new fully grown southern live oak trees. While the soil and trees were replaced, people were restricted from rolling the trees with paper until they acclimated to their environment. In 2016, the trees were replaced a second time after they were set on fire by Jochen Wiest following Auburn‚Äôs win over Louisiana State University. Attempts had been made to save the trees, but it was decided that the trees were unlikely to survive. The other tree that borders College Street was not affected by the vandalism via fire but had failed to grow properly for unknown reasons. In February 2017, two fully grown trees were planted to replace the tree that had failed and the tree that had been lit ablaze.

Before her transition, McLeod was a G.I. who served in the army from 1948-1949. She was discharged from the Army for minor medical reasons.  Life before transition  McLeod was originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, but also lived in Miami and Tennessee at different points throughout her life. McLeod's father recalled that she rarely engaged in sports or other games with boys. McLeod was a GI in the military from 1948-1949 and was discharged for minor medical reasons. When asked about why she left, McLeod stated: \\"Everyone could see that I was no soldier, and that it was all a mistake.‚Äù McLeod was unable to get the plastic surgery in America she wanted. Instead, American doctors attempted to change her transgender identity: \\"I‚Äôve never been a boy‚Äînot in my mind. American doctors offered to make me more of a man, but could never give me a man‚Äôs mind‚Äù McLeod commented several times on the dire emotional state she was in due to her inability to be the gender she felt she truly was. During her time in America she felt suicidal due to her inability to receive surgery in America, stating: ‚ÄúI was treated neither as male or female‚Äîmore as a nonentity‚Ä¶I was miserable and I wanted to die.‚Äù  Surgery  McLeod was living in Dyersburg, Tennessee just before she traveled to Denmark for the surgeries that would allow her to transition from male to female. McLeod, age 28 traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark in the years 1953-1954 to receive the plastic surgery that would allow her to transition from male to female. McLeod was able to pay for travel because her Great Aunt had provided her with an inheritance. When McLeod first went to Denmark to receive plastic surgery there was a law that stated they could only perform the operation on Scandinavians. However, McLeod still underwent a sex change surgery that was performed by professors and surgeons free of charge. McLeod's surgery was cited as being rather dangerous and unconventional. However, McLeod's intentions to return home a woman did not falter: ‚ÄúThe thought of having come all this way in vain and return as the Charlie I hated was unbearable. So I managed to have the first operation made unofficially. It happened on a kitchen table at midnight and that‚Äôs all I want to say about that, but the operation almost killed me.‚Äù = Return home = For a short while after her surgery, McLeod lived in a boarding house operated by the Second Baptist Church. They eventually asked McLeod to leave, stating: \\"We have done what we could for Charlotte and we will continue to do our Christian duty toward a person in distress, but we just cannot take this. We have therefore told Charlotte that we thought it wisest if she found another place to stay until everything is quiet again.\\" However, upon returning home, McLeod found herself to be very happy and was surrounded by people who loved and supported her: ‚ÄúI fit right in where I left off. It‚Äôs wonderful to be back home. Friends don‚Äôt feel any different toward me now than before. They‚Äôve accepted the many changes.‚Äù  Career  McLeod performed a one woman show once a week at SHO- BAR at 228 Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was a nine act show where she discussed different aspects of her transition. She also appeared as a Comedienne in Green Village Bistro in Boston in 1954. McLeod did not have a strong desire for this kind of career, but continued to work in entertainment in order to make enough money to live a normal life. She was quoted telling The San Francisco Examiner that: ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt look forward to night club work, but thinks it necessary to pay bills. She said she is looking forward to married life and a home of her own.‚Äù = Other jobs = McLeod was documented working as a secretary for six weeks, as well as demonstrating cosmetics at a Miami Beach shop. = Lawsuit = Elmo Badon, the owner of the Moulin Rouge at 231 Bourbon Street in New Orleans, sued McLeod in 1954. Badon claimed that McLeod was meant to perform as an entertainer at his club but then had later refused. The judge, Rene A. Viosca, signed a restraining order against McLeod that temporarily stopped her from appearing in any night club as an entertainer. Badon eventually lost the case and the restraining order was lifted.  Name change  McLeod was able to change her name from Charles Earnest McLeod to Charlotte Frances McLeod at age 29. The petition for the name change was filed by attorney R.C. Colton, Jr., who stated: \\"Applicant at all times wears women‚Äôs clothing and other articles of dress and cosmetics peculiar to the female sex.‚Äù McLeod's passport was issued to \\"Charlotte Frances McLeod, a female.\\"  Marriage and family life  McLeod was married at age 34 in Miami, Florida. McLeod's husband, Ralph H. Heidal, was from New York and was 36 years old when he married McLeod. The couple were married on October 11th, 1959. = Relationship with father = McLeod's father, Charles McLeod Sr., worked in insurance. He and McLeod's mother divorced and were each remarried. Charles had two other daughters with his second wife. Originally, Charles was against McLeod's operation because American doctors had warned him it would be dangerous for McLeod's health. When he learned that a Memphis psychiatrist was giving her hormones, he walked out of the office in disgust. Because of the threat that surgery would have to McLeod's life, Charles told McLeod that he would not help her. However, after McLeod returned, her father stated: ‚ÄúI was opposed to the operation, but now that it‚Äôs over, I‚Äôm ready to support Charlotte as my daughter.‚Äù He was also quoted saying other supportive claims such as: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little hard to get used to after all these years. But I will, you can bet on that.‚Äù ‚ÄúI guess he always wanted to be a girl.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was happy to see her. I hope that this change will be better. I hope she‚Äôll be happy.‚Äù  Comparisons to Christine Jorgenson  Christine Jorgenson was the first widely known transgender woman to travel to Denmark in order to have operations that would allow her to transition from male to female. McLeod had stated to newspapers that she had planned to go to Denmark to receive surgery before Jorgenson. Charlotte McLeod was known to have a dislike towards Jorgenson. At one of her one-woman shows, she was quoted saying: ‚ÄúI just wish she‚Äôd come in here some night so I could yell ‚ÄòCheck your hat, mister.‚Äù McLeod's story was written in the press to be very different from Jorgenson's. Generally, Jorgenson was presented as a positive example of a trans woman, while McLeod was often mocked by the press. Time magazine wrote: ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äôs story resembles Christine‚Äôs. He was a sensitive boy, quiet and lonely, with a penchant for dressing up in women‚Äôs clothing. Like Christine, he was drafted into the Army; unlike Christine, he found it too hard.‚Äù McLeod stated that since controversy arose from Christine's transformation, McLeod had to go about hers in secret. Christine Jorgenson, when told about McLeod, said she had no advice to give: ‚ÄúPeople get exactly what they give out. I feel that a person makes his own way and his attitudes are reflected through other people. I cannot offer advice to anyone else. I can say only what I have done. At all times, I have conducted myself like a lady.‚Äù  Press  An incident between McLeod and the press was discussed frequently in many articles just after her arrival to America from Denmark. Upon returning home, McLeod was being photographed leaving the Hotel Statler, where she was staying. Overwhelmed by all the chaos, McLeod hit a photographer by the name of Glenn D. Everett with her umbrella. McLeod declined going to the hospital afterwards despite her stomach pains. During the incident, McLeod was quoted stating: \\"Go away...I can't say anything.\\" Everyone involved in the incident was taken to the police station. Charges of assault against McLeod were initially filed but were then taken down.  Autobiography  McLeod published an autobiography discussing her life and her transition in Mr. Magazine. In her autobiography she discussed issues such as the distinction between homosexuals and drag queens. She also displayed a dislike towards New Orleans gay counterculture, stating: ‚ÄúI was appalled at their insincerity, insecurity, and promiscuity practiced among them. I did feel a great sympathy for many of these young men and women who I met, but I could find no peace of mind among them.‚Äù  References  External links  * Charlotte McLeod Collection (Digital Transgender Archive) Year of birth missing Possibly living people Transgender and transsexual women Writers from New Orleans United States Army personnel Transgender and transsexual military personnel Women memoirists Military personnel from Louisiana ","title":"Charlotte Frances McLeod"},{"id":"58993864","title":"Minal Khan"},{"id":"58993894","text":"Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Durgapur or locally called as JNV Durgapur is a boarding, co-educational school in Paschim Bardhaman district of West Bengal in India.

The sap of the male is also sweeter than the female.  Extraction of date sap Date palm trees grow abundantly around villages in Bengal. Usually the date sap emits from the soft trunk of the top-most part of the date tree in winter. The bark and some pith of trunk are shaved everyday, very delicately, to make the juice or sap flow. Much like extracting rubber, an earthen container is hung at the shaved part of the tree to hold the juice, which collects overnight. In early morning of the next day, villagers collect the extract filled container. the juice which flows during the day is not of very good quality and is prone to spoilage while in the earthen container. Collecting date juice is almost exclusively a rural practice.  Protection from bats  Since it is very sweet, the Nipah virus carrier bats love to drink date sap.

The novel won the Prix Goncourt, one of France's highest literary awards, making Maran the first black author to win that honor. Summary Batouala was written by Ren√© Maran, French Guyanese poet, in 1921. It centers on the life of the chieftain Batouala, and his attempts to stop a younger man from courting one of his nine wives. It is a series of sketches that show the life of the Bandas including food and celebrations, and describes how they live in a continuous cycle with nature, as the white man tries to take control over nature. Every year the rainy season comes with death and destruction, and this is considered a part of life to the tribes. Batouala also speaks about the French forcing the Bandas into slavery on their railroads and in their rubber plantations, which causes the tribe to live in poverty and disease as they do not have proper time to tend to their crops. Impact Batouala earned Maran the Prix Goncourt, making him the first black author to earn this prestigious honour. The preface of the novel contains critiques of French colonial abuses, and due to this it was banned from French colonies in 1928. Despite the racial themes in the novel, Maran said it was not written to show a battle between black and white, but instead, it was written to tell the story of two men fighting over a woman. Setting Batouala is set in the Grimari village in the southern part of French Equatorial Africa's Ubangi-Shari colony, now the Central African Republic.

It is a large cavity overlooking a perennial stream called the . Human remains attributed to the Tautavel Man and the lithic remnants of the Lower Paleolithic were discovered in the cave. Location and description Arago Cave Arago cave is located in the southern part of France, at the east of the Pyr√©n√©es, in the French department of Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, in the town of Tautavel. Included in a limestone cliff of the Corbi√®res Massif, it overlooks several tens of meters (80 m today, less than 60 at the time of Tautavel Man) of wide valley where the Verdouble stream leaves a canyon to meander in this plain. The cavern is thirty meters long but could have measured up to a hundred and twenty meters during the prehistoric period. Its maximum width is 10 meters. It is currently opening to the south but the opening was facing east before the collapse. This advantageous situation made it a perfect shelter for prehistoric Hunter-gatherers. The eastern opening on a south facing cliff allowed relatively high temperatures during winter. The highly contrasted relief of this environment produced several ecological niches that provided as many types of prey: animals adapted to the river (beavers), others adapted to the plain, which was, according to successive periods and climates, covered with forest (deer) or steppe (horses, bison, rhinos, elephants), living herbivores on craggy grounds (mouflons, ibex, tahrs, chamois), and still others on uplands with more harsh climates (musk oxen, reindeer). In addition, under the cave, there was a fording where herds of large herbivores passed, which facilitated hunting. The elevated position of the cave made it an excellent observatory for spotting herds in the plain. The nearby river (which never ran dry) provided water as well as pebbles to cover the soil of the cave or serve as tools. The distant environment, less than a half-day walk (about 30 km), could provide other stones to make tools: flint (in Roquefort-des-Corbi√®res), red jasper (in Corneilla-de-Conflent), cherts (in Rivesaltes), quartzites (in Soulatg√©), volcanic rocks (Col de Couisse). Scientific interest The Arago cave has more than fifteen meters of sediment, rocks, and debris accumulated over a period of about 100,000 to 700,000 years. By their quantity (the period of excavations from 1967 to 1994 yielded about 260,000 objects including bones and lithic remains) and their diversity, these vestiges give much information on prehistoric human groups that lived there, but also on animals, plants, and climates that followed in the region during these 600,000 years. On July 27, 2015, the Museum of Prehistory of Tautavel announced the discovery by young volunteer excavators of a tooth dating back 550,000 years on the site. This fossil tooth is 100,000 years older than the skull of the Man of Tautavel. Arago 21 =Tautavel Man= Tautavel Man (Homo erectus tautavelensis) is a proposed subspecies of Homo erectus, the type specimen being 450,000-year-old fossil remains discovered in the Arago cave. =Fauna and flora= The remains of a large and varied fauna have been found in the Arago cave, with 122 different species represented. Many remains of mammal species testify to the feeding of humans at different times. A slender horse (Equus mosbachensis tautavelensis) seems to have been the main prey during the Tautavel man's days (level G), with bison (Bison priscus) also found in large numbers at the same time. The excavations also revealed numerous remains of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), deer (Cervus elaphus), fallow deer (Dama sp.), Musk oxen (Praeovibos priscus), moufflons (Ovis ammon), tahrs (Hemitragus bonali). ) and rhino (Dicerorhinus hemitoechus) and remains of Deninger bears (Ursus deningeri). Excavation history Excavation session Known since the middle of the nineteenth century for the remains of animals, the Arago cave began to yield evidence of prehistoric industry to J. Abelanet in 1948. In the 1950s, the brothers Ribes de Maury and Raymond Gabas of Saint-Paul-de-Fenouillet were among the first to perform excavations, as amateur archaeologists. They collaborated with J. Abelanet and their findings helped realize the importance and richness of the site. Systematic excavation campaigns, led by Henry de Lumley, have been conducted every year since April 1964. The first annual campaigns (in 1964, 1965 and 1966) lasted two weeks. The following ones, from 1967 to 1978, one month, then three months (from 1979 to 1991) and, since 1992, five months. The Arago cave was listed as a historic monument in April 1965. Stratigraphy and chronology Its powerful filling, about ten meters thick, covers most of the Middle Pleistocene and has been the subject of numerous attempts at radiometric dating that are sometimes contradictory. Limit ages of about 700 and 350 000 years were obtained by uranium-thorium dating for stalagmitic floors at the base (floor 0) and at the top (floor Œ±) of the stratigraphic sequence, respectively.  Set 3  The main archaeological levels are found in the third set (soils levels D to G) and would be between 300 and 450 000 years old. This ensemble also delivered a number of human fossils, including an incomplete skull (face, frontal and parietal right) (Arago XXI, G soil) and two mandibles (Arago II, G soil and Arago XIII, soil F) attributed to the man of Tautavel. Discoveries from the oldest layers of set III have been described as ancient Tayacian or \\"Tautav√©lien\\". They are made mainly of quartz, more rarely flint and quartzite, and include scrapers, many notched tools (denticulate, notches, Tayac spikes, beaks, etc.), pebbles cut and rare bifaces (less than 1 for 1000 tools). At the top of the set III (layer E), the bifaces are proportionally more, which led Henry de Lumley to link the industry to the average Acheulean. However, these differences should be tempered because the numbers of bifaces are very small in levels G to D, and where the proportions between major technological classes slightly vary, whether we consider the whole industry or only the tooling. The materials used are mostly local (80%) and were taken from the alluvial deposits of Verdouble, but some came from areas 30 km far north-east and southwest of the site, reflecting a good knowledge of the regional resources and an anticipation of needs.

It contained originally a spinning mill, a warehouse, a spinning shed, and an engine house with chimney and was destroyed in a fire on 28 January 2016. As of May 2019 the site of the former mill was advertised as available for redevelopment, although the new owners of the land are currently unknown. History The factory was built for James Drummond & Son by the architects Henry Francis Lockwood and William MawsonLockwood & Mawson also designed Bradford City Hall. and was practically finished in December 1885. In 1886 the premises were opened for business. Production ceased in 2001. The complex was declared a Grade II listed building in 1979. The site was acquired by SKA Textiles, based in Huddersfield. The buildings were used for storage purposes and by theatre groups. While plans submitted in 2004 for the development of flats and businesses in the former mill had failed, new ones were submitted in 2012. The site was also the seat of the head offices of the World Curry Festival. =The fire= Drummond Mill burning On 28 January 2016 in windy weather, a fire broke out in the basement of Drummond Mills which was used to store flammable goods, among them cardboard boxes. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service was called around 11:30. The fire spread so rapidly that saving the historic building became impossible. Firefighting efforts had to be concentrated on its containment and the protection of neighbouring properties. Residents and employees there had to be evacuated because of the smoke. Reaching its peak around 15:00, the fire was under control by 22:30. The partial collapse of the buildings necessitated their demolition, making it impossible to ascertain the cause of the fire. Demolition continued in May 2016 and was expected to take until autumn of the same year. The fire caused appeals to preserve the industrial heritage of West Yorkshire. Buildings Drummond Mill chimney The mill was built of sandstone blocks with ashlar dressings in an italianate style similar to that of Salts Mill in Saltaire, albeit of a more sober design. Cast iron pillars and double skin floors provided a measure of fireproofing, which was important due to the large amount of flammable materials usually found in a textile mill. The spinning mill was originally flanked by stair turrets on both sides, although those on the Lumb Lane side were removed later. The spinning shed linked the three-storey warehouse with the five-storey main building, which in turn was linked to the boiler house. The octagonal chimney of the latter, which stands on a square plinth, has been named as \\"one of the best mill chimneys in Bradford\\" by Historic England.

It exists southeast of the Grenville Front and extends from Labrador southwestern to Lake Huron. It is bounded by the St. Lawrence River/Seaway to the southeast. The Grenville Front separates the Grenville Province from the Superior Craton. Adjacent to the Grenville Front is the Parautochthonous Belt. The Parautochthonous Belt is made of rocks originally derived from the Superior Craton, which have been metamorphosed and reworked since their emplacement. The rocks to the southwest of the Parautochthonous Belt are various accreted terranes that have been thrust upon or emplaced during the various tectonic events that have taken place from 2.0-0.98 billion years ago. The compositions of these terranes are unique and have distinct depleted mantle model ages. During the formation of the Grenville Province, the type of tectonism changed. The earliest stages of formation were dominated by arrested subduction. The type of tectonism then changed to flat slab subduction. In the late stages of formation the tectonism changed to collisional orogenesis. Although there has been many studies done on the Grenville Province, the origins of the various terranes are still not fully understood and may never be fully known.  Subdivisions of the Grenville Province  The subdivisions of the Grenville Province. PAB refers to the parautochthonous belt. = Central Metasedimentary Belt = The Central Metasedimentary Boundary Thrust Zone makes up the northwestern boundary of the Central Metasedimentary Belt. It was created during the Shawinigan Orogeny (1.19-1.14 Ga). The Central Metasedimentary Belt is bordered to the south by Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks and Lake Ontario. In the northeastern central Metasedimentary Belt, the rocks are composed of Orthogneiss. The region is known as the Bondy and LaCoste domical complexes. In the southwestern Metasedimentary Belt, the rocks are tonalitic to granitic orthogneisses. Nd model ages of the Central Metasedimentary Belt range from 1.55-1.4 Ga. The origin of this area can be attributed to rifting (which made the accommodation for the sediments) and subsequent thrusting from the collision with Amazonia. = Barillia = Barillia is located northeast of Lake Huron. It is bound by the allocthon boundary thrust (ABT) and Algonquia to the south, and Laurentia to the north. It is an accreted arc that was accreted during the Penokean orogeny. Barillia's composition is calc-alkaline granitic gneiss. Nd model ages of Barillia are around 1.90 Ga. = Makkovikia = Makkovikia is located in eastern Labrador. It was created during the Makkovik orogeny. An Andean-type arc developed and was accreted onto the preexisting continental rocks. Makkovikia's composition is rather complicated. The Kaipokok domain has both Archean crust and Paleoproterozoic volcanics and sedimentary rocks. Within the Aillik and Cape Harrison domains, there are plutonic rocks. Nd model ages of Makkovikia are around 1.90 Ga. = Labradoria = Labradoria is located in northeastern Qu√©bec. Labradoria is part of an Andean style arc that accreted around 1.67-1.66 Ga. It was later intruded by continental arc plutons during Pinwarian orogeny. It is composied of calc-alkaline batholiths. Nd model ages of Labradoria are around 1.70 Ga. = Quebecia = Quebecia is located in central Qu√©bec near Baie-Comeau and Forestville. It is bordered to the south by the St. Lawrence River. Quebecia is an accreted arc and is calk-alkaline in composition. Nd model ages of Quebecia are around 1.55 Ga. = Mekinac = Mekinac is located northeast of Ottawa, Canada. It was created with Andean- style magmatism. The origin is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to the origin of the Adirondacks. This makes it related to the Shawinigan orogeny. Its composition is tonalitic gneiss. Nd model ages of Mekinac are around 1.4-1.5 Ga. = Morin = Morin is located near Ottawa, Canada. It was a terrane that was thrust up during the Shawinigan orogeny around 1.19-1.16 Ga. Its composition is Anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite- granite. Nd model ages of Morin are around 1.3-1.5 Ga. = Adirondacks = The Adirondacks are located in northeastern New York, United States. The Adirondacks were accreted during the Shawinigan orogeny. This is evidenced by the deformation in the allochtonous monocyclic belt. The Highlands and Lowlands of the Adirondacks were separated before the Shawinigan orogeny. This is evidenced by differing compositions of plutonic rocks. Only the Highlands experienced Ottawan high-temperature metamorphism while the Lowlands displaced along Carthage-Colton shear zone and ended up next to Highlands. The composition of the Southern Adirondacks consists of orthoquartzite. In the Adirondack Lowlands there are ophiolites and calc-alkaline granitoids. In the Adirondack Highlands orthogneisses are present with metapelitic migmatites. The Adirondacks as a whole do not contain Archean zircons and therefore rocks are not sourced from Laurentia. It has a Nd model age ranging from 1.3-1.5 Ga. = Algonquia = Algonquia is located east of the Georgian Bay in Ontario, Canada. It was an allochthon that was thrust up onto existing continental rock. The plutonic ages do not match surrounding rocks, which gives evidence of it being an exotic terrane. Algonquia's composition is orthogneiss, diorite, and quartz-dioritic orthogneiss. Its Nd model age is between 1.6-1.9 Ga. = Parry Sound= Parry Sound is located east of the Georgian Bay in Ontario, Canada. Perry Sound is a nappe that was thrust up on existing continental rock. This is proven by the similarities of the compositions to the Central Metasedimentary Belt and the Adirondack Highlands. The quartzite is evidence that the three terranes were all continuous at one point due to the zircons contained within it matching the Central Metasedimentary Belt and the Adirondack Highlands. Parry Sound is composed of migmatitic quartzite, gneiss, anorthosite, and gabbro. Its Nd model age is around 1.4-1.6 Ga.  Overall Tectonic History  The ductile lower crust of the nappes allowed for the terranes to be accreted on the continental margin via a lower crustal indenter. Later events such as late-stage thrusting and extension can be attributed to gravitational spreading. = Collision Zone Changes = In the Paleoproterozoic, the Grenville Province was controlled by arrested subduction. During the beginning stages of the Mesoproterozoic (1.60-1.23 Ga) the Grenville Province was controlled by flat slab subduction. By the later stages of the Mesoproterozoic (1.23-0.90 Ga), the Grenville Province was controlled by pressure-point orogenesis.  _Arrested Subduction_ = Makkovikian (1.89-1.80 Ga)  Penokean (1.86-1.83 Ga) = The Algonquian terrane was accreted during this orogeny. = Pre-Labradorian (>1.71 Ga) = Juvenile crust was developed without interaction of the older crustal material. Terranes accreted during this time would be related to the Makkovikian and Penokean orogenies. = Labradorian (1.71-1.66 Ga) = A calc-alkaline arc was accreted on preexisting Laurentia. = Collisional Orogenesis (~1.66 Ga) = Metamorphism of the arc and preexisting Laurentia took place creating mylonite zones. = Trans-Labradorian Magmatism (1.65-1.62 Ga) = Crustal thickening represented by the accreted arc on preexisting Laurentia caused magmatism. = Late Labradorian (1.62-1.60 Ga) = A passive margin that accumulated sediment formed due to lack of tectonic activity.  _Flat Slab Subduction_  The subduction zone central location changes from south to north during this time. = Post- Labradorian and pre-Pinwarian (1.60-1.52 Ga) = There is a continuation of the passive margin during this time. = Pinwarian (1.52-1.46 Ga) = Felsic magmatism dominates this time period. The cause of the magmatism is debated between an extensional setting or a continental-margin arc. The name is in relation to the ensuing orogeny and metamorphism. = Early to mid- Elsonian (1.46-1.29 Ga) = Pinwarian magmatism has stopped by this time. Gabbros were formed in the northern Grenville Province around 1.46-1.43 Ga, named the Michael-Shabogamo gabbros. From 1.42 to 1.35 Ga, there is no magmatic activity. After this period and until the end of the mid-Elsonian, the Nain Plutonic Suite is emplaced in Labrador. = Late Elsonian (1.29-1.23 Ga) = Felsic magmatism dominates the north and south areas of Labrador while mafic magmatism dominates the central area of Labrador.  _Collisional Orogenesis_ = Elzevirian Orogenesis (1.23-1.18 Ga) = Felsic magmatism ceases and accretion of island arcs occurs in the Central Metasedimentary Belt. = Post-Elzevirian and Pre-Grenvillian (1.18-1.08 Ga) = Mixed compression and extension caused broad mafic magmatism during this time. This could be related to the Shawinigan orogeny which occurred in the southwestern region of the Grenville Province. = Grenvillian (1.08-0.98 Ga) = During this time, deformation and metamorphism was widely spread throughout the entire Grenville Province but the level of intensity varied. The exterior section of the province was subject to more deformation and metamorphism, while the interior was subject to more magmatism. The magmatism was exclusively in preexisting crust.

Kindergarten through 4th remained at the Elementary School in DeWitt. DeWitt students of 5th or 6th were bussed to either Grand Mound or Welton. If a student was at either Grand Mound or Welton, they were bused to the other school for the other. This was changed so the student would go the same school for the 6th grade. After the new elementary school was opened in DeWitt in 1970, students stayed in their local school until 6th grade. The older DeWitt Elementary becoming a jr. high with 6 through 8th grades. The outlying schools were closed by the late 1970s.

When a new school was planned and built in the autumn of 1959, the three story building was reconfigured into a junior high. By the late 1980s it was decided that the junior high school building was becoming too costly to maintain and was too expensive to bring up to code. It also lacked certain necessities including handicap accessibility. The school also posed a danger due to the presence of asbestos throughout the building. It was demolished by 1995 after a new junior high/intermediate school was built adjoining the high school. The new school's need for increased space has resulted in a recent $1.891 million addition. Construction of the new facilities began in November 2007, and includes a new cafeteria, remodeled kitchen space, and new alternative classroom. In 2010-2011, another expansion project was started, creating a new middle school, new high school offices, several new classrooms, renovation of the old high school, a new library that attaches to the Intermediate, Middle and High school, a world-class performing arts center, and new athletic facilities.Central will show off new high school addition Athletics Central DeWitt High School won state championships in boys basketball in 1981, girls basketball in 1994, girls track and field in 1990 and 2002, boys cross country in 2000 and 2001, boys golf in 2017 and 2018.

It is the type species of the genus Aequidens. It is reasonably common in the aquarium trade. Description The saddle cichlid shows significant variation in colour and thus variation is geographic. In the western parts of its range, in Ecuador and Peru they develop striking red or orange colouration on the lower jaw, the head and the forward portion of the belly while Brazilian specimens are more of an overall grey or blue or green colouration. The males grow larger than the females and they usually grow extensions to the dorsal, caudal and anal fins as they reach sexual maturity. In spawning condition the males are more brightly coloured than the females. The maximum recorded length of the saddle cichlid is . Distributiion The saddle cichlid is the most widely distributed of the cichlids in the genus Aequidens it is found throughout the basin of the Amazon River in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil and Bolivia. It also occurs in the Rio Tocantins and Rio Parnaiba, in French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana as well as in the Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. Habitat and biology The saddle cichlid is a habitat generalist which shows a preference for slow-moving or still water with complex substrates consisting of submerged tree roots, branches, leaf litter and other objects. During periods of high water this species moves into flooded forests and this results in its occurrence in flood plain lakes and oxbows. It is most commonly observed in the quieter tributaries instead of the main river channels and has also been recorded at localities with a dense growth of aquatic plants. The water in the rivers in which it occurs can vary from clear through to almost black, although clear water appears to be favoured. They are omnivorous, especially in captivity, but wild fish have diet dominated by invertebrates, such as insects, and small fish, as well as some vegetable matter It is a highly territorial species which lives in pairs. Around a thousand eggs are laid on a stone or piece of wood. The eggs are tended by both parents. left Taxonomy This species is the type species of the genus Aequidens but many authorities have hypothesised that as currently recognised this taxon is probably a group of related fish species instead of a single taxonand that some of the distinct populations may be described as distinct species once detailed analysis is performed. A. tetramerus and its closely related taxa have been found to be a sister taxa to the genus Cichlasoma and this has suggested that Aequidens is a nomen dubium due to paraphyly and that all but two species should be placed in the genus Cichlasome while two species should be placed in Krobia. Aquaria The saddle cichlid is easy to obrtain and relatively easy to keep and breed as an aquarium fish, although the males can be territorial and they may prey on smaller species kept in a community tank.

It was a temple dedicated to the Ephesian version of Artemis, and the cult of her in Massalia was closely connected to the cult of her in Ephesus. It was one of the three most important shrines in Massalia, alongside the Temple of Apollon Delphinios and the Temple of Athena. Strabo described the temple: :\\"Massilia [in Gaul] was founded by the [Greek] Phokaians, and it is situated on a rocky place. Its harbour lies at the foot of a theatre-like rock which faces south . . . It is on the headland that the Ephesion [temple of Artemis Ephesia] and also a temple of Apollon Delphinios (of the Dolphins) are situated. The latter is shared in common by all Ionians, whereas the Ephesion is a temple dedicated solely to Artemis Ephesia (of Ephesos): for when the Phokaians were setting sail from their homeland an oracle was delivered to them, it is said, to use for their voyage a guide received from Artemis Ephesia; accordingly, some of them put in at Ephesos and inquired in what way they might procure from the goddess what had been enjoined upon them. Now the goddess, in a dream, it is said, had stood beside Aristarkha, one of the women held in very high honour, and commanded her to sail away with the Phokaians, taking with her a certain reproduction [of the main statue of Artemis Ephesia] which was among the sacred images; this done and the colony finally settled, they not only established the temple but also did Aristarkha the exceptional honour of appointing her priestess; further, in the colonial cities [of Massilia] the people everywhere do this goddess honours of the first rank, and they preserve the artistic design of the ‚Äòxoanon‚Äô [primitive wooden images which were supposed to have originally fallen from heaven] the same, and all the other usages precisely the same as is customary in the mother-city.\\"Strabo, Geography 4. 1. 4 The Temple of Artemis Ephesia in Massalia was an important center of the Massaliotes and its colonies and the Greek population in Gaul. According to Strabo, a second temple was established near the Rh√¥ne (Rhodanos in Greek): \\"They [the Massiliotes] also established a temple of Artemis Ephesia there [i.e. at the mouth of the Rhodanos in southern Gaul], after first enclosing a piece of land which is made an island by the mouths of the river.\\"Strabo, Geography 4. 1. 8 The cult of The Ephesian Artemis also reportedly spread so far as to the Iberians: \\"They [the people of Massilia] founded in Iberia [towns] as strongholds against the Iberians, and they also taught the Iberians the sacred rites of Artemis Ephesia, as practiced in the fatherland, so that they sacrifice by the Greek ritual.\\"Strabo, Geography 4. 1. 5 While an Ionic capital has been found, believed to belong to the sanctuary, the exact location of the temple has not yet been established.

Early life Sturgis was born in New York City on September 13, 1847. He was the son of William Sturgis Jr. (1806‚Äì1895) and Elizabeth Knight (n√©e Hinckley) Sturgis (1809‚Äì1849). Among his siblings was Annie Sturgis Freeman, William Sturgis (who married Anna Sprague), and Thomas Sturgis (who married Helen Rutgers), who became a rancher in Wyoming. His father was a prominent merchant of New York, Boston and London and his mother was from an old Yarmouth, Massachusetts family. Sturgis traced his earliest American ancestry back to Edward Sturgis, who was born in England in 1613, and arrived in America in 1630. His paternal grandfather was William F. Sturgis, a Boston merchant in the China trade, the California hide trade and the Maritime fur trade. His paternal aunt was Ellen Sturgis Hooper, a Transcendentalist poet who was the wife of Dr. Robert William Hooper (and the mother of society hostess Marian Hooper Adams, the wife of Henry Adams of the Adams political family). His paternal uncle was Russell Sturgis (the head of Baring Brothers in Londong and the father of Boston architect John Hubbard Sturgis and novelists Julian and Howard Sturgis). He was educated in the public schools in New York before beginning his business career. Career At the age of sixteen, Sturgis joined a mercantile firm as a clerk. In January 1868, he joined the banking firm of Capron, Strong & Company, quickly becoming a partner of the firm in 1869 at the age of twenty-two. The original firm became known as Work, Strong & Company in 1871 and in 1896, it became Strong, Stugis & Company. On January 12, 1869, he was admitted to membership in the New York Stock Exchange, serving on the governing committee (since 1876) and later becoming its vice president. In 1892, he was elected as president of the exchange. While serving as president, \\"it was largely at his suggestion and through his labors, in association with other leading financiers, that the Clearing House was established.\\" He was re-elected the following year and served during the Panic of 1893 until 1894. Sturgis testified before the Pujo Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, set up to investigate the so-called \\"money trust\\" and, reportedly, gave \\"quick and incisive replies to the severe examination of Samuel Untermyer.\\" In 1914, Sturgis, who was known as \\"the Beau Brummel of his day\\", was honored with a resolution from its members praising his record of service and expressing their gratitude for his part in expanding the Exchange and upgrading its standards. He retired from active business at the age of seventy-two in 1919. Upon his death in 1932, the governing committee of the Exchange adopted a resolution praising his services, stating: > \\"The death of Frank K. Sturgis has deeply moved those members of the New > York Stock Exchange who remember the closing years of the nineteenth > century. The Exchange at that time was a local institution dealing mainly in > American railroad securities and had not yet developed into the great world > market of today. In those earlier years, when the foundations were being > laid for the present international market in New York, Mr. Sturgis was a > conspicuous leader both as president and as governor of the Exchange. His > clear judgment, his high ideals, as well as his charming personality, gave > him a unique and commanding position among his fellow-members.\\" =Society life= In 1892, both Sturgis and his wife were both included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. He was a member of the Union Club, the Knickerbocker Club (serving as vice president), and the New York Yacht Club. He was also a founder and president (in 1911) of the Metropolitan Club in New York. In Newport, he served as president of the Newport Casino and was a director of the Redwood Library and president of the Newport Historical Society. Sturgis was close friends with James Gordon Bennett Jr., fellow sportsman who was the publisher of the New York Herald. Sturgis, a well-known sportsman, was a member of the Coaching Club and served as its president in 1916. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Coney Island Jockey Club, operators of the Sheepshead Bay Race Track. He bred horses and served as president of the National Horse Show Associations, Madison Square Garden (from 1891 until it dissolved in 1912), and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Personal life On October 16, 1872, Sturgis was married to Florence Lydig (d. 1922). She was the daughter of Philip Mesier Lydig, the family that owned the land that subsequently became the Bronx Park; the park now contains the New York Botanical Garden. Florence and Frank, who did not have any children together, resided at 17 East 51st Street in New York, a classical townhouse designed in 1905 by prominent architect Ogden Codman, Jr., another cousin of Sturgis. The townhouse was built of limestone, with giant fluted pilasters, and was similar to a house designed by Robert Adam at 20 St James's Square in London. The Sturgis' owned a summer home in Lenox, Massachusetts known as Clipston Grange, where Frank bred horses. The home was originally built in 1870 in the village, but was moved to Kemble Street in 1893, shortly before the Sturgis' bought it in 1894 and had it enlarged into a colonial revival mansion. In Newport, they owned a villa known as Faxon Lodge on Cliff Avenue. Faxon Lodge was designed for the Sturgis' in 1903, also by Codman. The home was purchased by former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Belgium, and Italy, Henry P. Fletcher in 1936. Today, the home is owned by Salve Regina University and is known as Conley Hall. His wife died in New York in March 1922 and was buried at Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island. Upon his wife's death, in her honor, he endowed the Florence Lydig Sturgis Endowment Fund for the purpose of purchasing birds for the Zoological Park collection of the New York Zoological Society. In her will, she left the Lenox estate to Frank. After four years of near invalidism, Sturgis died on June 15, 1932, also at his home in New York City. After a funeral at Grace Church which was officiated by the church's rector, Rev. Dr. Stanley C. Hughes, he was buried beside his wife at Island Cemetery in Newport. =Estate= In his will, he left $55,000 in cash bequests to four public institutions, $1,300,000 to his relatives, and the reside of his multi-million dollar estate to the Winifred Masterson Burke Relief Foundation. In October 1932, 210 items from his estate were auctioned off including twelve paintings by English artists such as J.F. Herring, John Boultbee, Harry Hall, Charles Cooper Henderson, and Dean Wolstenholme.

His original name was Park Gi-pyeong (). Biography Park Nohae was born in 1957 in Hampyeong, South Jeolla Province, a southern province of South Korea, and grew up in a farming town, Beolgyo, Goheung. Both his father, a pansori singer, who had participated in Korea‚Äôs independence and progressive movements, and his mother who was a devout Catholic, greatly influenced him from his childhood. Later, his brother became a priest and headed the Catholic Priests Association for Justice that took a leading role in the democratization of South Korea, and his younger sister became a nun. At the age of seven when his father suddenly passed away, his fate began to get on a wild journey, as his family became poor, and the family members had to be separated from each other. Such misfortune and solitude at his early age made him get immersed in reading and writing. Park left his hometown and moved to Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. He worked during daytime and attended the night classes at Seollin Commercial High School. He began to build up a labor activist‚Äôs career while working in the fields of construction, textiles, chemicals, metals, and logistics. At that time, Korea was going through a dark period under the military dictatorship; night curfews were in place; freedom of the press, presidential elections, and labor‚Äôs primary rights were severely violated. = 1980s, \\"the icon of Revolutionary\\" in South Korea = The 1980s, when the labor movement was at its most active in South Korea, was also the most active period for the creation of labor poetry. The poetry of this time, represented mainly by Park Nohae and Baek Mu-san. He then took the pseudonym Park Nohae(‚ÄòNo‚Äô means ‚Äòlabor,‚Äô ‚ÄòHae‚Äô means ‚Äòliberation‚Äô) and published his first collection of poems, Dawn of Labor, in 1984, under that name. Korea was at that time under the military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan, with strict censorship. Despite official bans, this collection sold nearly a million copies and created intense interest. The unknown poet became an intensely symbolic figure of resistance. The government authorities tried in vain to identify and arrest him. = 1990s, Demanded the death sentence, Sentenced to life imprisonment = For many years he was active underground, helping establish the Socialist Labour League of South Korea in 1989. After spending seven years of his life hiding from the police, he was finally arrested in 1991. After twenty-four days of investigation, coupled with cruel, illegal torture, at his trial the state prosecutors even demanded the death sentence for him as an enemy of the state. He was finally sentenced to life imprisonment. While he was in prison, a second poetry collection was published, True Beginning(1993) as well as a collection of essays, Only a Person is Hope(1997). He was finally freed in 1998 after being amnestied by President Kim Dae-Jung. Withdrawing from his previous role, he helped establish a nonprofit social organization ‚ÄúNanum Munhwa‚Äù(Culture of Sharing) with Koreans concerned with the great challenges confronting global humanity. = 2000s, Global Peace Sharing as a photographer as well as an activist = In 2003, at the United States‚Äô invasion of Iraq, he went to protect helpless civilians and promote peace. At that time, he undertook peace activities in Bagdad and in other Middle Eastern countries for 75 days. In 2006 he was in Lebanon on a similar peace-making mission and publicly opposed the dispatch of Korean combat troops to the Middle East. From the start he combined poetry- writing and photography, as he went to many countries that were suffering from wars and poverty, such as Palestine, Kurdistan, Pakistan, Aceh (Indonesia), Burma, India, Ethiopia, Sudan, Peru and Bolivia. In 2010 he held his first exhibition of photos ‚ÄúRa Wilderness,‚Äù and since then he has continued to hold exhibitions to draw public attention to global issues of poverty, human values, and warfare. In 2010 he finally published a large new collection of poems, So You Must Not Disappear, on themes such as resistance, spirituality, education, living, revolution and love. Since then, living in a remote rural community far from Seoul, he continues, with the members of ‚ÄúCulture of Sharing,‚Äù to hold photo exhibitions in a dedicated gallery, the Ra Cafe and Gallery, in Seoul, also occasionally publishing photo albums, such as ‚ÄúLike Them, I am There,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnother Way.‚Äù = 2016-2017 Candlelight Revolution = When the citizens of Korea began to hold candlelight demonstrations in protest at the corruption of the Korean government under Park Geun-hae, he and the members of ‚ÄúCulture of Sharing‚Äù participated actively, then in 2017 published a large album book Candlelight Revolution for first anniversary of the Candlelight Revolution. He continues to be active and to write, while efforts are now underway to make his work and writings available internationally in translation.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History Along with Amos Gould and Alfred William, Edwin Todd invested in the Amboy, Lansing, and Traverse Bay Railroad Company, which opened its rail line from Owosso to Lansing in 1862. Although initially shaky, the line proved a financial success, and Todd earned enough money to begin investing in other enterprises. He soon had a stake in a number of saw mills, wool carding companies, and other industries in Owosso. Around 1890, he constructed this fine residence for his family. Description The Todd House is a two-story Queen Anne brick and clapboard residence, with asymmetrical massing and an irregular roofline. The facade uses a wide variety of finishes and ornamentation. The first floor contains a large rounded arch window, topped with a brick voussoir and limestone keystones. A carved fan half- pediment is placed above the front entry, and there are carved rising-sun and star details in the baseboard.

In one of the early wars (740 BCE) between the Lacedaemonians and the Argives, the Asinaeans joined the former when they invaded the Argive territory under their king Nicander; but as soon as the Lacedaemonians returned home, the Argives laid siege to Asine and razed it to the ground, sparing only the temple of the Pytha√´us Apollo. The Asinaeans escaped by sea; and the Lacedaemonians gave to them, after the end of the First Messenian War, a portion of the Messenian territory, where they built the Messenian Asine. Asine stood on the western side of the Messenian Gulf, which was sometimes called the Asinaean gulf, from this town.·ºàœÉŒπŒΩŒ±·øñŒøœÇ Œ∫œåŒªœÄŒøœÇ, Asinaeus Sinus, Asine was distant 40 stadia north of the promontory Akritas, 40 stadia from Colonides, 15 miles from Methone, and 30 miles from Messene.Tabula Peutingeriana The Messenian Asine continued to be a place of considerable importance from its foundation at the close of the First Messenian War till the sixth century of the common era, when it is mentioned by Hierocles. It is spoken of by Herodotus as a town of the Dryopes, and its name occurs in the history of the Peloponnesian War, and in subsequent events. When the Messenians returned to their own country after the Battle of Leuctra, 371 BCE, the Asinaeans were not molested by them; and even in the time of Pausanias (2nd century) they still gloried in the name of Dryopes. Its site is located near the modern Koroni, which is situated upon a hill jutting out into the sea above Cape Acritas. The ancient town of Corone was situated further north; and it has been reasonably conjectured that the inhabitants of Corone removed from their town to the deserted site of Asine, and carried with them their ancient name - such a migration of names not being uncommon in Greece.

There was lack of information on women and SROW did research, on a mostly voluntary basis, to support policy and planning relevant to women. Over 70 reports of research were published between 1966 and 1991. Research topics covered motherhood and solo mothers, child care, employment, retraining, the education of girls, housing, caregiving, immigrant women, abortion, finance and retirement. SROW was wound up in 2006.  History  In the 1960s New Zealand women were becoming aware of, and influenced by, the women‚Äôs movement. Several initiatives to progress the position of women had occurred including the Council for Equal Pay and Opportunity (1957), the Government Service Equal Pay Act (1960), and the Joint Committee on Women and Employment (1964) leading to the National Advisory Council on the Employment of Women (NACEW) in 1967. In 1966 a series of lectures in Wellington on the Changing Role of Women examined issues for women. The interest generated by the lectures led to SROW‚Äôs formation. The founders were a group of women associated with a Newlands Playcentre, including Margaret Shields (who was later to become a Member of Parliament), Mary Mowbray and others. They identified the paucity of information on women and believed that information and scientifically-grounded research findings could be used to influence government policy. SROW was active from 1966 until the 1990s. There were several reasons for SROW to be wound up gradually from the early 1990s. Research on women was being done by other bodies and in the universities. The funding from government ceased in the 1980s at the same time the membership was declining. In 1991 it was decided to wind up the national organisation but two branches (Wellington and Christchurch) continued to operate. When SROW wound up in 2006 its funds were transferred to the New Horizons for Women Trust which was set up by a number of women's organisations, including SROW, to fund research on women‚Äôs issues and to support women who wanted a second chance at education and training.  SROW‚Äôs Objectives  1\\\\. To examine from time to time the attitudes of individuals, groups, and the community to the education of girls and their subsequent employment, the factual situation and the needs of girls and women 2\\\\. To publicise the findings in the appropriate quarters 3\\\\. To endeavour by all appropriate means to bring about such changes as may be shown to be desirable. 4\\\\. To further in every way possible the general interests of women in New Zealand  Structure, membership and funding = Structure = The first SROW branch was in Wellington. By 1973 there were branches in Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin and the Waikato. SROW was committed to a structure according to feminist organisational principles wherever possible. Its structure was a grassroots one of study groups which proposed, organised and carried out research projects. Branch committees reviewed research proposals and a National Projects Committee advised and provided technical help. This structure and process ensured projects met acceptable research standards. The branches were autonomous but a National Executive of elected officers met once a month to deal with communications, bulletins etc, to set broad policies and standards, and arrange for the publication and distribution of research reports. = Membership = Membership grew to over 1100 by 1968, decreasing to the 200s by 1987. It waxed and waned with the formation of new branches and recruitment for new projects. Membership declined with the closure of branches and completion of research projects. In the early days most members were mothers who were not in paid employment but later the number of women in paid employment increased; this reflected the changes in society.  Volunteers  SROW was founded with the intention of using volunteers to carry out research. This was partly through necessity. But there was a ‚Äústrong sense of the value of women working for women‚Äù as well as using SROW to give women occupational and other opportunities through participation and training in research. This was successful though volunteers could have quite different levels of commitment and research skills. This gave rise to problems around skills required for more intensive and skilled phases of investigations. As time went by some members had become social scientists and the necessary expertise could be found within the membership. = Funding = SROW received an annual grant from government of $5000 (later $7500) administered by a government-appointed Research Fund Administration Committee (RFAC). It evaluated research design, methods, feasibility, intended use of results and cost estimates but rarely questioned the choice of research topics. The yearly grant ended when the RFAC‚Äôs functions were transferred to the new Ministry for Women‚Äôs Affairs in 1988. Publication of research reports also provided funds.  Research  In line with SROW‚Äôs goals, the areas of research were broadly 1\\\\. becoming a parent 2\\\\. parenting 3\\\\. quality of life for families 4\\\\. education 5\\\\. employment 6\\\\. gender related issues (including financial management).  Achievements  From 1966-1991 70 pieces of work were published. An early publication was Urban Women (1972). Over 5000 women were surveyed on employment and retraining, education, community involvement and leisure interests. It found that 60% of all New Zealand women left school without qualifications and ended up in low-paid, low-status jobs. Mary Mowbray, Joan Stagpoole and Margaret Shields presented the report to the then Minister of Finance, Robert Muldoon. SROW‚Äôs research played a key role in exposing women‚Äôs inequality and disadvantage. By the time of a 1975 conference, Education and the Equality of the Sexes, SROW had demonstrated the usefulness of research as a tool in fighting inequality. The aim of producing sound research to be used by policy makers and analysts in decision making was realised. The Society also used its own findings to make its own submissions on social policy. SROW offered its members many opportunities. Research training equipped a number of women to enter the workforce in a research capacity. Members also gained leadership skills. Some became members of parliament, cabinet ministers and Ministers for Women (Margaret Shields and Ann Hercus) or academics in universities. Penny Jamieson, became the first woman Anglican Bishop and Silvia Cartwright became Governor-General of New Zealand. Former members of SROW held many senior positions in the public sector.

Built in several stages Salesianum comprises the St. Karl Borrom√§us chapel (built 1615/1637), the baroque inspired Herrenhaus (built 1750) and the French-style inspired Mittelbau (built 1750-1769). The building has undergone several modifications since 1750 continuing until the present. A number of auxiliary buildings of varying age, not directly connected to the main buildings, make up the remainder of the complex as it stands today. Salesianum Zug, from the East (Photo: 2018)  History  The St. Karlshof, where the Salesianum is located, gets its name from Saint Charles Borromeo (Karl Borrom√§us), a papal emissary. According to a legend he crossed the Lake Zug in 1570 with a boat from Buonas and set his feet on Zug dry land for the first time at this location. In his honour and name, the chapel was constructed in 1615 by Jakob Stocker. The chapel was renovated in 1637 by Kaspar Weissenbach. In 1744 the estate was taken over by Johann Kaspar Lutiger, who constructed the southern Herrenhaus in 1750, and later the Mittelbau (1750-1769) was built to connect the chapel with the Herrenhaus. In 1840 Peter Zwyssig from Baden bought the estate. In the beginning of the same decade, as monasteries were being nationalized, the brother of Peter Zwyssig, Alberich Zwyssig, fled from the monastery of Wettingen to the St. Karlshof in Zug. While residing there and in the chapel of St. Karl, Alberich Zwyssig wrote the \\"Schweizerpsalm\\", the national anthem for the Swiss Confederation. In 1846 the St. Karlshof was sold to Franz Anton Wickart In 1898 the property was bought by the Institute of Menzingen, under Mother Salesia Strickler, a native Menzinger from Bumbachhof. The French-style inspired villa and mansion was renamed the Salesianum in her honour. Between 1898 and 1970, the Menzingen nuns ran Institut Salesianum, a day and boarding school on the premises. Until 2002, the premises continued to be used to educate young ladies with learning disabilities. Then, between 2003 and 2010, the property housed the Riverside Campus of the International School of Zug and Luzern (ISZL). In 2011, the real-estate developer Alfred M√ºller AG bought the property from the Menzinger Sisters. From 2015 until 2018 the property was rented out to the Canton of Zug for the purpose of housing refugees and asylum seekers.

Besides playing club cricket for Dublin University, he also played a few matches for Phoenix. By the early 1930s, his work was taking him to different parts of the British Empire. In 1931, while in Egypt, he played a minor match for Gezira Sports Club at Cairo. In 1933, while in British India, he played a minor match for Punjab and North West Frontier against the Free Foresters at Lahore. He died at Umtali in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in December 1961, today modern day Zimbabwe.

Prior to the coup, Obiang had become Secretary General of the Ministry of Popular Armed Forces in 1976 and Deputy Minister of the Armed Forces in 1979. = Development = Overthrowing Mac√≠as, this group was constituted as the Revolutionary Military Council, chaired by Obiang himself. The other members of the Council were Florencio May√© El√° as First Vice President and Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Salvador El√° Nseng as Second Vice President, among others. The islands of the country (collectively part of the Insular Region) were renamed as Bioko (formerly known as Mac√≠as Nguema Biyogo) and Annob√≥n (formerly known as Pagal√∫). The new regime found that the coffers of the state were empty and the population was barely a third of what was at the time of independence of the country in 1968, due to repression and exile. On 23 August, the first ministerial cabinet of the Council was constituted, composed of eleven members: President Obiang, Florencio May√© El√° as First Vice President of the Government in charge of Foreign Affairs, Salvador El√° Nseng as Second Vice President in charge of Finances and Commerce, F√©lix Mb√° Nchama (Interior), Pablo Qbama Eyang (Sanitation), Policarpo Monduy Mb√° (Justice), Pedro Nsu√© Qbama (Industry and Mines), Paulino Obiang Enama (Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry), Tarsicio Man√© Abeso (Culture and Public Works), Pedro Ed√∫ (Transport and Urbanism) and Melchor Ndong (Labor).

Mac√≠as was tried, sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on 29 September 1979. On 12 October, Obiang proclaimed himself President of the country.

The company deceived consumers with false success stories and used threats and intimidation to discourage complaints by its victims. WPM employed Matthew Whitaker, who served as acting United States Attorney General from 2018 to 2019, as an adviser, and featured him in promotional videos. Business model The company's business model was to lure in would-be inventors. Potential customers learned of the company through television or internet advertisements. Those who visited the World Patent Marketing website would find a listing of WPM's Advisory Board and a series of misrepresentations including success stories, testimonials, and major retailers in which customers' products were sold. Retailers included various nationwide online and/or retail giants including: AutoZone, Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, The Home Depot, HSN, Lowe's, PetSmart, QVC, Sears, SkyMall, Staples, Target, Toys \\"R\\" Us and Walgreens, as well as \\"World Patent Marketing Shop\\". On its Facebook page, in December 2015, it posted that \\"Mattell partners with World Patent Marketing to Retail Latest Toy Inventions\\". The company boasted, in a news release for the launch of New York Inventor Exchange (NYIE) on January 1, 2015, of being \\"the only patent assistance company in history to be awarded a five star review rating from Consumer Affairs, Google, Trustpilot, Shopper Approved, Customer Lobby and ResellerRatings.com. They claimed to have an \\"A\\" rating from the Better Business Bureau. On its website, the firm linked to positive reviews from sites all offering remarkably high satisfaction ratings of the service (consumeraffairs.com, CustomerLobby.com and TrustPilot.com), albeit with just a few negative reviews. WPM billed itself as a champion of military veterans, offered them military discounts, and made special efforts to outreach to veterans in its marketing. World Patent Marketing would charge its inventor clients up to $400,000 for marketing and development assistance for helping them with their inventions, ignored them once they paid their fees, and responded to complaints with threats and intimidation. Following a criminal investigation, in May 2017 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a preliminary report in which they outlined the company's method of operation. According to the FTC, when potential customers submitted their proposed product ideas they were first told that World Patent Marketing's \\"review team\\" was researching the proposal because \\"the company is so selective with the ideas they choose to work with.\\" They told potential customers that their review included a \\"Global Invention Royalty Analysis\\" containing a marketability study created by a \\"Harvard University & MIT Research Team.\\" Shortly thereafter the company contacted the customer with a sales script saying: > We had our final meeting with the Review Team regarding your idea. And > basically from all the research that's been done on [your idea], the > research tells us there's definitely potential to patent your idea. Because > of that, I have the green light from the company to let you know that WPM > wants to be a part of your new product idea and help you to protect it and > bring it to the commercial marketplace. So, first of all congratulations! . > . . The company loved your idea! They think it has a lot of potential. > Especially the Sr. Product Director, who is in charge of which ideas are > considered for the upcoming trade show. He sees some good opportunities > ahead. However, the FTC concluded that the company had no Review Team and no association with Harvard or MIT, nor had it appeared to ever turn down an idea for a new product. Several of the more unusual inventions and partnerships that World Patent Marketing listed in their press releases included the \\"Masculine Toilet\\" for unusually well-endowed males, a partnership arrangement with \\"World-renowned physicist, author, and scholar Dr. Ronald Mallett [who] believes time travel is possible, perhaps within the next decade,\\" and a website that claims that \\"DNA evidence collected in 2013 proves that Bigfoot does exist,\\" which sells Bigfoot items such as stuffed animals. The company also planned a celebrity event called \\"You Have Been Squatched!\\" =Suppression of complaints= According to the FTC, World Patent Marketing used threats of criminal prosecution and intimidation to discourage and suppress complaints. A review of emails done by Forbes featured an example of a woman who had filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau after she had been unsuccessful in her attempts to negotiate a refund. She then received an email from a company lawyer telling her that seeking a refund constituted extortion and \\"since you used email to make your threats, you would be subject to a federal extortion charge, which carries a term of imprisonment of up to two years and potential criminal fines. See 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 875(d).\\" Another dissatisfied customer who filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau when he was unable to find a satisfactory agreement received an email from the firm's advisory board member Matthew Whitaker in which Whitaker claimed that the customer's actions appeared to be an attempt at possible blackmail or extortion and there could be \\"serious civil and criminal consequences\\" for filing a complaint. Claiming that he, too, was an attorney, the customer wrote back: \\"Stop with your bullshit emails...You are party to a scam...You will be exposed. I hope I make myself clear, Mr. Whitaker.\\" The FTC reported that World Patent Marketing also attempted to frighten their customers by sending them emails describing a company security team of \\"all ex-Israeli Special Ops and trained in Krav Maga, one of the most deadly of the martial arts...The World Patent Marketing Security Team are the kind of guys who are trained to knockout first and ask questions later.\\" In their 2017 report the FTC included an example of emails that the company used to prevent or retract complaints: > Hey Genius [ ] I understand you emailed one of my board members telling her > you think my company lacks integrity and you think we might be a fraud. Just > wanted to let you know that is probably going to be the most expensive email > you ever sent. I hope it was worth it . . . meet my attorneys Eric Creizman > and Andrew Levi [ ] they really enjoy meeting new people. In early 2015, when posts critical of WPMI appeared on Ripoff Report, a consumer complaint company's website, Whitaker phoned the operator of the website and, using vulgar language, threatened to sue the owner and ruin his business for allowing \\"false\\" reports, even threatening the owner with Department of Homeland Security intervention. Advisory board According to the FTC and journalists who have read the email exchanges between the company and its customers, the company relied heavily on the influence of its board members to both attract customers and threaten them. In an April 2016 email Scott Cooper replied to an angry customer, \\"Do you think all these powerful and influential people would join forces with me if what you said were true? We have former US Attorneys, members of President Obama's advisory council, military generals, famous doctors. Think about it.\\" Promotion scripts used by company representatives also instructed them to boast about the company's \\"incredible advisory board\\" and mention Matt Whitaker by name. Whitaker was also used in broader marketing; on November 2014, Cooper, the CEO, wrote an email to a brand building company with the subject line, \\"Let's build a Wikipedia page and use Whitaker to make it credible.\\" Members of the advisory board included Matthew Whitaker, who later became the 2018 acting United States Attorney General, Republican Congressman Brian Mast, the scientist Ronald Mallett, Omar Rivero, founder of Occupy Democrats, Moti Horenstein, Nitzan Nuriel, Dell L. Dailey, Christopher R. Seaver, and New York attorney Eric M. Creizman. Matthew Whitaker was named to the advisory board of World Patent Marketing in 2014. He also appeared in promotional materials and assisted in emailing threats to disgruntled customers. Two months into his association with the firm, Whitaker said in promotional material, \\"As a former US Attorney, I would only align myself with a first class organization. World Patent Marketing goes beyond making statements about doing business 'ethically' and translates those words into action.\\" Following the shut down the other advisory board members returned fees they had received, however according to news reports, Whitaker did not respond to a request for fees to be returned. Omar Rivero, founder of Occupy Democrats, joined the firm in February 2015. In a news release Rivero stated he hoped to assist Cooper \\"to rid our country of the patent troll scam [which is] forcing startups to shut down and they are putting a stranglehold on the American Dream.\\" Attorney Eric M. Creizman joined the firm in October 2015. He was advertised as one of the top ten lawyers in New York and \\"a trained legal assassin,\\" who had authored many publications that exposed white collar and federal crimes. Creizman accepted his advisory position with the firm saying, \\"I am delighted and honored to join the World Patent Marketing Advisory Board. It's an honor to be affiliated with Scott Cooper ‚Äì he is a visionary and a philanthropist working hard to push innovations that can make a real difference in people's lives.\\" In August 2015, the firm hired Moti Horenstein as Director of Security Risk Management with a mission \\"to update and modernize security at the World Patent Marketing Headquarters in Miami Beach and in their offices worldwide.\\" Horenstein is a well-known martial arts fighter and instructor. He is considered an expert in Krav Maga, a discipline developed in Israel. In July 2015, the company announced that they had brought in Christopher R. Seaver, a Florida surgeon who specializes in robotics, \\"to head up our Medical Advisory Board.\\" Claiming to \\"dominate the fields of medical patents and prototypes,\\" they said they planned to \\"maintain [their] competitive edge by forming alliances with the most brilliant minds on the planet.\\" The release quoted Seaver: \\"World Patent Marketing is an exciting company whose ideas and innovations are cutting edge. Combining technology, customer service and street smarts, World Patent Marketing is leading the industry into a very bright future.\\" The Advisory Board included two military terrorism experts. In April 2016, World Patent Marketing announced \\"Ambassador-at-Large for the United States Counter-Terrorism effort, Dell Dailey, has joined the World Patent Marketing Advisory Board.\\" Dailey commented, \\"The work that World Patent Marketing and The Cooper Idea Foundation does in developing countries is inspiring and is a true model of corporate social responsibility.\\" Existing board member Israeli Defense Forces General Nitzan Nuriel, who joined the company in 2015, welcomed the new addition to the board saying, \\"Safety and security are the most challenging issues of our day. Winning the war against terror requires integrity and advanced technology. At World Patent Marketing we are committed to making the world safer, more secure and more prosperous.\\" In 2017, former advisory board member Brian Mast made a statement to court that he was appointed to the advisory board without his consent. Another board member, Aileen M. Marty, a professor of infectious disease at Florida International University in Miami, said she had been told that she would be sent patent ideas to review. She never received any and returned the check she had received when she heard the company might be committing fraud. She commented, \\"I wish I had never heard of the company and I wish that my name were not in any way associated with it. I can't turn back time and not accept the offer to be on their board ‚Äî believe me if I could, I would.\\" Shut down In April 2016 when an irate customer, Crystal Carlson, received a threatening email from Cooper she searched Facebook and found dozens of other inventors who had also been scammed. Most notably she tracked down the inventor of \\"Teddy's Ballie Bumpers,\\" which World Patent Marketers were using as a star success story, saying that the inventor had seen sales \\"skyrocket\\". However, the inventor told Carlson that the Patent Office had rejected his application and he was left with thousands of bumpers stored in a warehouse, selling only 15. Carlson organized victims and they filed a class-action lawsuit in December 2016 alleging deception, fraud, and violations of the American Inventors Protection Act's disclosure rules. Cooper's firm claimed to not be bound by the American Inventors Protection Act and accused the claimants of blaming the company for the failure of their invention ideas. However, by 2017 negative comments from other customers began to pour in online. In January 2017, an undercover FTC investigator contacted the firm with his idea for an invention, a recipe. As usual, a salesperson responded he \\"had a great idea with lasting power\\" and \\"should expect a revenue stream for decades\\" even though recipes are almost impossible to patent. The company was shut down by the FTC in March 2017. According to the FTC, \\"consumers paid Scott Cooper and his companies, World Patent Marketing Inc. and Desa Industries Inc., thousands of dollars to patent and market their inventions based on bogus 'success stories' and testimonials promoted by the defendants. But after they strung consumers along for months or even years, the defendants did not deliver what they promised. Instead, many customers ended up in debt or lost their life savings with nothing to show for it.\\" In 2018 Cooper was banned from running businesses that promote inventions. Inventors invested a total of $26 million with the company, of which the FTC had only located $2 million . Cooper denied wrongdoing but was ordered to pay $1m as well as the proceeds from selling his $3.5m mansion in Miami. According to a November 9, 2018 news release by The Wall Street Journal, a criminal investigation by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's Miami office was ongoing.

Pemberton was born at Dublin in March 1904 to Benjamin and Rosannah Pemberton, the fifth of seven children. He was educated at Christ Church Cathedral Grammar School. Pemberton began his club cricket as an opening fast-medium bowler for Civil Service (Dublin). He made his debut in first-class cricket for Ireland against Scotland at Dublin. Following a successful season with Civil Service in 1923, in which he took 90% of the clubs wickets and helped guide them to second place in the Leinster Senior League, Pemberton became involved in an internal dispute at the club and left with several other players. He joined Clontarf the following season. He made his second first-class appearance for Ireland against Wales at Belfast in 1926, and followed this up with a further two first-class appearances in 1928 against Scotland at Edinburgh, and the Marylebone Cricket Club at Dublin. He was unable to bring his wicket-taking prowess from club cricket into first- class cricket, taking 5 wickets at an average of 52.60, with best figures of 3/40. He also scored 55 runs, with a high score of 31. Continuing to play club cricket, he played for Clontarf until 1935, after which he joined Leinster. He played for Leinster until 1940, before seemingly retiring from playing, however ten years later he played one more match for Clontarf. By the end of his club career, he had taken 575 wickets at an impressive average of 14.84. He died at Dublin in December 1978.
