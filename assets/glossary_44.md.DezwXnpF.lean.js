Ledger art flourished primarily from the 1860s to the 1920s. A revival of ledger art began in the 1960s and 1970s. The term comes from the accounting ledger books that were a common source of paper for Plains Indians during the late 19th century. Kiowa ledger art drawing possibly depicting the Buffalo Wallow battle in 1874, a fight between Southern Plains Indians and the U.S. Army during the Red River War. Historical precedents The Sand Creek massacre as drawn by eyewitness Howling Wolf (1874‚Äì1875). Ledger art evolved from Plains hide painting.\\"Ledger Art History.\\" Department of Ethnic Studies, University of California San Diego: Plains Indian Ledger Art Project. 2011 (retrieved 2 Oct 2011) Among Plains tribes, women have historical painted abstract geometrical designs, such as those found in parfleches, whereas men paint representational designs. The men's designs were often heraldic devices or visions painted on shields, tipis, shirts, leggings, or robes. Before the Plains tribes were forced to live on reservations in the 1870s, men generally painted personal feats in battle or hunting.Hansen, 138 Plains ledger art depicted communally acknowledged events of valor and tribal importance in order to gain status for the individuals who participated in them, and their band and kin. Plains pictorial art emphasizes narrative action and eliminates unnecessary detail or backgrounds.Greene, 11 Figures tended to be drawn in hard outlines and filled with solid fields of color.Greene, 63 These narrative works were all historically painted on animal hides ‚Äì particularly buffalo hides. When buffalo became scarce after the US federal government's eradication programs, Plains artists began painting and drawing on paper, canvas, and muslin. New materials An increasing supply of ledger books and other paper came from traders, government agents, missionaries, and military officers.Swan, 70 With these came pencils, ink fountain pens, crayons, and watercolor paints.Hansen, 139 These new tools allowed for greater detail and experimentation than the earlier tools, such as bone or wood styli dipped in mineral pigments, had. The compact ledger books and pencils were highly portable, making them ideal for nomadic lifestyles.Greene, 13 Fort Marion Black Hawk (Sans Arc Lakota), c. 1880 depicting a horned Thunder Being (Haokah) on a horse-like creature with eagle talons and buffalo horns. The creature's tail forms a rainbow that represents the entrance to the Spirit World, and the dots represent hail. Accompanying the picture on the page were the words: \\"Dream or vision of himself changed to a destroyer and riding a buffalo eagle.\\" Some of the most well-known ledger drawing artists were prisoners of war at Fort Marion in St. Augustine, Florida. In 1874, in what became known as the Red River War or Buffalo War, a group of Cheyenne, Kiowa, Comanche, warriors fought the US Army to protect the last free herd of buffalo and to assert their autonomy.Szabo, 12‚Äì14 In the harsh winter of 1874 to 1875, many tribal camps were forced to surrender to various Indian agencies, and the supposed leaders of the Red River War were rounded up and sent to Fort Marion.Szabo, 14 From 1875 to 1878, the 71 men and one woman were under the command of Richard Henry Pratt, who used the opportunity to give the Indians a Western education.Szabo, 25 He also provided the prisoners with basic art supplies, such as pencils, ink, crayons, watercolor paint, and paper. Twenty- six of the Fort Marion prisoners engaged in drawing. They were younger Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Kiowa men.Szabo, 29 Some of the most prolific and well- known artists include Paul Caryl Zotom (Kiowa); David Pendleton Oakerhater or Making Medicine (Cheyenne); Tichkematse or Squint Eyes (Cheyenne), who later worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC; Wohaw (Kiowa); Howling Wolf (Cheyenne); Etahdleuh Doanmoe (Kiowa); White Bear (Arapaho); Koba (Kiowa); and Bear‚Äôs Heart (Cheyenne). Tichtematse, Howling Wolf, White Bear, and Koba all continued drawing after their release from prison.Szabo, 110 Cheyenne Dog Soldier artists Following a July, 1869 battle at Summit Springs in northeastern Colorado, a ledger book was retrieved from the Cheyenne's burned village. A Calvary trooper's notations on one of the pages states, \\"This book was captured by the Fifth U.S. Calvary on their charge through the Indian Village July 10th 69.\\" The collection of drawings are known as the Summit Springs Sketchbook, or Dog Soldier Ledger Book. The drawings in the book depict events and people from the period between the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre and the 1869 Summit Springs Battle. =Major artists= * Bear With Feathers - created 25 drawings in which he rendered the human figures, and it appears that another artist drew the horses. *White Bird - created seventeen drawings, fourteen of which were autobiographical. *Red Lance - created sixteen drawings, six of which are autobiographical, two depict Buffalo Robe, three depict White Horse, and the rest depict other warriors. Red Lance often drew horses in true profile. *Unidentified artist (Two Birds or Black Bear) - created ten pages. Two Birds is depicted with a complete eagle feather fall, and carrying a red shield; Black Bear is depicted with an upright headdress with several ermine tails. =Minor artists= White Horse created three drawings using the \\"X-ray technique\\". Pistol created three autobiographical drawings using the X-ray technique. Tomahawk created four highly graphic drawings. White Wolfcreated five drawings, three of which were autobiographical. Warrior X (unnamed) created three autobiographical drawings. Subject matter Battle exploits dominated ledger art. Other themes such as hunting, courtship,Fauntleroy, Gussie. \\"Ledger Art: Looking Between the Lines.\\" Native Peoples. Sept/Oct 2011 (retrieved 7 Aug 2011) and religious practices were common subjects. Ledger artists also documented their rapidly changing environment by portraying encroaching European Americans and new technologies such as trains and cameras. Many ledger artists worked with ethnologists, by documenting shield and tipi designs, ethnobotanical information, winter counts, dance customs and regalia, and other cultural information. Dreams and visions inspired ledger art just as they had inspired earlier hide paintings.Hansen, 140 The artists creating ledger art today often reference pre-reservation lifeways, historical transitions, and social commentary. They use this style to illustrate cultural continuity between historical and contemporary Native life.  Easel arts  The warrior \\"Low Dog\\" by Red Dog, 1884 ledger art Missionaries, anthropologists, and tourists eagerly collected ledger books in the late 19th century. Carl Sweezy (Southern Arapaho, 1881‚Äì1953) and Haungooah (Silver Horn) (Kiowa, 1860‚Äì1940) both established professional careers as ledger artists. These early Southern Plains easel artists in turn inspired the Kiowa Six. These artists painted with Western art-grade materials and met with international success when they exhibited their work in the 1928 International Art Congress in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Contemporary interpretations Numerous Northern and Southern Plains artists create ledger paintings, today, including many women artists despite Plains narrative figuritive painting being a masculine art genre in the past.Pearce, p. xiii Many seek out 19th-century documents on which to paint, creating ironic juxtapositions between the printed text and the paintings. Dwayne Wilcox (Oglala Lakota) uses the style of 19th-century Lakota painters to express humorous views of modern realities for Lakota people. Arthur Amiotte (Oglala Lakota) builds upon the collage aspect of ledger art and combines text, photography, naturalistic painting and stylized Plains pictorial art in his work. Dolores Purdy (Caddo/Winnebago) is a woman ledger artist who uses bright colors and female figures frequently in her work.Fauntleroy, Gussie. \\"Ledger art: Looking between the lines.\\" Native Peoples.

He eventually rose to the rank of Post-Captain. He did not see action in many significant engagements, and is chiefly remembered for the accidental loss of his ship to the French, and for the unsuccessful chase of two French ships in the English Channel. He did command a number of ships of the line under several of the leading naval commanders of his time. His early death though prevented him from achieving the same seniority and degree of fame as his relatives did. Family and early life Barrington was born the eldest son of Captain, later Vice-Admiral, James Richard Dacres, and his wife Eleanor Blandford Pearce. The Dacres would eventually become a substantial naval dynasty. Barrington's brother James Richard Dacres became a vice-admiral, as did Barrington's uncle Richard Dacres, while his cousin Sydney Dacres became an admiral, and First Sea Lord. Career Barrington Dacres took command of the newly converted bomb vessel in 1799. He remained in command until 27 February 1801, when he put into the Italian port of Ancona, unaware that it had been captured by the French. The French seized the Bulldog. Captain Thomas Rogers of attempted to recapture the Bulldog by cutting her out of the port. Although Rogers nearly successful, the British were forced to abandon her again. She was finally retaken off Gallipoli on 16 September 1801 by Lord William Stuart's . Dacres's career does not appear to have been particularly adversely affected by the accidental loss of his ship. He was promoted to Post-Captain on 29 April 1802. He took command of the 74-gun third rate in May 1803, and recommissioned her in July that year. On 5 June, he captured the Petronelle. By September, he was cruising in the English Channel as part of Sir Edward Pellew's squadron, when the French 74-gun Duguay-Trouin was spotted sailing in company with the 38-gun frigate Guerri√®re. The two had already been engaged by , under Captain John Maitland, but the French ships had driven her off and were now bound for Corunna. Dacres took the Culloden in pursuit, eventually closing the distance and opening fire. The Duguay-Trouin was first to reach the safety of the port, but Dacres continued to engage the Guerri√®re until he was almost under the guns of the shore batteries. He eventually veered away, having inflicted considerable damage and several casualties. Dacres remained in command of Culloden until being succeeded by Captain George Reynolds in February 1804. Dacres then took command of the 74-gun in February, and was involved in the blockade of Brest, under Rear-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. He was succeeded by John Hunter in August 1804. By January 1805, Dacres was briefly aboard , taking over from Captain Francis Temple, but by March, Temple was back in command. He took command of HMS Hercule, capturing a number of merchant vessels carrying sugar on 9 July 1806. Death Barrington Dacres appears to have been in poor health and died at Bath, Somerset on 25 October 1806. He predeceased his father, who died in January 1810.

After his retirement from Alcan, he was named the 10th Chancellor of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He served in the position from 1957 to 1964.  Life and career  Ray Edwin Powell was born in Table Grove, Illinois on December 7, 1887. He attended the University of Illinois for his post-secondary education, but dropped out before receiving his degree because of lack of financing. Powell was later awarded an Honorary Degree from this institution and several other universities. During World War I, Powell served in the United States Army. After the war, he worked at Alcoa, also known as the Aluminum Company of America. In 1928, Powell moved to Canada, becoming the vice president of what was later known as Alcan, the Aluminum Company of Canada, a subsidiary of Alcoa. The non-US operations of Alcoa were spun off from their parent company due to anti-trust regulations and were collectively united under the new Canadian company headed by Powell. Alcan eventually became larger than Alcoa and was one of the largest companies in Canada. He later rose to become Alcan's President from 1937 to 1957. In the first seven years of his tenure, Alcan's assets increased 500%. While Powell was President, he oversaw the company's expansion from its business related to World War II. During the war, Powell used loans from the British, American, and Australian governments and tax arrangements with the government of Canada to expand Alcan's facilities along the Saguenay River. In the early 1950s, Alcan expanded once again by establishing a power development and smelter in Kitimat, British Columbia. Powell helped make Alcan into an independent Canadian company, separating it from Alcoa. Rio Tinto, one of the largest mineral companies in the world, purchased Alcan for US$38 Billion in 2007 and merged it with their own aluminum operations to form Rio Tinto Alcan. The company is based in Montreal and is the largest aluminum company in the world. Queen Elizabeth was rumored to have considered Powell for knighthood until it was discovered that he had retained his US citizenship and not become a Canadian, despite living in Canada for the last 45 years of his life. This honor was to commemorate Powell for his efforts in supplying aluminum to the Allied effort during World War II and for being one of the greatest industrialists in Canadian history. After retiring from Alcan in 1957 at age 70, Powell became the 10th Chancellor of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and held this top position until 1964. He also served as the university's Governor from 1950 to 1966, when he became Emeritus Governor. He died in Montreal on November 9, 1973. He was survived by his wife, Cecile Smith Powell (1899-2000), four children (Robert, Mary, Cynthia and Andrew) and 16 grandchildren. He was predeceased by his brother, Ervin Powell. His daughter Mary is the wife of David M. Culver, who spent his career at Alcan, retiring as Chairman and CEO in 1989. Ray Powell's son Robert (born 1923) and daughter Cynthia (born in 1927) both died in 2006, while his other children Mary (born 1925) and Andrew (born 1930) both died in 2014. Powell's four children each had four children of their own, and the extended family is now spread throughout Canada, the US and Europe. Powell was often referred to as \\"Rip,\\" which was a close acronym for his initials \\"REP.\\" He served as a Director of several companies such as the Bank of Montreal. McGill created the Powell Student Services Building on the university campus in his honor. Alcan named one of its large vessels that transported bauxite, the raw material used to make aluminum, the \\"SunRip\\" as a tribute to Powell. Mount Powell, a peak in British Columbia, was named in his honor after he developed the Kitimat smelter facility for Alcan in that province.

These antennas, and corresponding indoor controllers, are used to connect phones and laptop computers from sailing vessels, on any ocean, with the rest of the world. All FleetBroadband antennas require line-of-sight to one of three geosynchronous orbit satellites, so the terminal can be used anywhere, including on land.  Details  The FleetBroadband network was developed by Inmarsat and is composed of three geosynchronous orbiting satellites called I-4 that allow contiguous global coverage, except for the poles. FleetBroadband systems installed on vessels may travel from ocean to ocean without human interaction. If there is line-of sight to one of the three I-4 satellites, then connectivity can be achieved, even in rough rolling seas. Since the FleetBroadband network uses the L band, rain fade is much less of an issue than the larger VSAT or C Band systems. The FleetBroadband service was modeled after terrestrial Internet services where IP-based traffic Internet Protocol dominated over ISDN and other earlier communication protocols. Many corporations and IT departments are standardizing around IP traffic for data, and voice and text communication, so it is assumed Inmarsat is filling that long-term communications requirement.  Terminals  There are three terminal antenna types available.

V. RamasamyA biographical sketch (, ) (17 September 1879 ‚Äì 24 December 1973), also known as Ramaswami, EVR, Thanthai Periyar, or Periyar, was a Dravidian social reformer and politician from India, who founded the Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam.Thakurta, Paranjoy Guha and Shankar Raghuraman (2004) A Time of Coalitions: Divided We Stand, Sage Publications. New Delhi, p. 230. In 1919 Periyar Ramaswamy joined the Indian National Congress after quitting his business and resigning from public posts. He was the chairman of Erode Municipality and undertook Constructive Programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability. In 1921, Periyar was imprisoned for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife as well as his sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to a strong presence of discrimination and indifference. He later quit the party on those grounds in 1925. Gurukulam Incident Even before he resigned from membership of the Congress, Periyar was convinced that communalism was deep-rooted in Tamil Nadu and that the forward community members of the Congress showed only lip service for backward classes. When Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi started the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1920, he suggested that Congressmen should avoid sending their children to schools which were under the supervision of the British rulers. There were also new schools started by individuals and charitable institutions, for the benefit of the children who were not going to Government schools.Gopalakrishnan, Periyar: Father of the Tamil race, pp. 14‚Äì17. In a place called Cheranmadevi in Tirunelveli district, a residential school, also known as Gurukulam, was started with help from the Tamil Nadu Congress. It was manned by V.V.S. Iyer who was believed to be an ardent Congressman. The Tamil Nadu Congress was given an annual grant of ten thousand rupees to the school. For the year 1925, half of the grant for the school had already been given by the time Periyar became the secretary. On receipt of complaint, Periyar found that Brahmin children and Non-Brahmin children were given food in separate places. He advised Iyer to treat children alike and not instill communalism into them by putting them into separate groups. Iyer refused to listen to Periyar's advice, upon which the latter refused to release the other half of the grant. Iyer then managed to get the amount from the joint secretary of the Congress, without the knowledge of Periyar. When this came to the attention of Periyar, he addressed public meetings about it and created public awareness of what was happening in Gurukulam. Prominent congressmen like Dr. Varadarajulu Naidu, Thiru V.Ka, S. Ramanathan and others condemned the sectarian attitude of Iyer in running a public institution. When Gandhi's attention was drawn to what was happening in the school, he too did not succeed in the matter. Iyer was reluctant to change his attitude and therefore the school was closed. Reasons for leaving Periyar was initially an enthusiastic supporter of Non-Cooperation movement but left the Congress in 1925 as he believed that the Congress was neither able nor willing to provide importance to the concerns of non-Brahmins. He was particularly angered by Gandhi's pro-Brahman speeches in Madras during his trip in 1927.Bandyopadhyaya, Sekhara, (2004). From Plassey to Partition: A history of modern India. Orient Longman: New Delhi. p. 349. When Periyar joined the Congress in 1919, he believed that the prominent people in that organisation were enlightened and hoped that with their co- operation, he could get rid of the practice of untouchability. Furthermore, Periyar believed that people of the backward and depressed classes could be enabled to have proper education and have their proper share in government appointments through the help of the Congress Party.Gopalakrishnan, Periyar: Father of the Tamil race, pp. 10 & 11. Periyar unsuccessfully tried to pass a resolution regarding communal representation five times. Soon after his return from Vaikom, Periyar made the last and sixth attempt at getting the Tamil Nadu Congress to pass the resolution regarding communal representation at a conference held in Kanchipuram in 1925. Thiru V.Ka was the President at the time and sensing opposition in the open session, he did not permit Periyar to propose the resolution. In utter disgust, Periyar left the Congress. So by the time Periyar resigned from the Congress, he knew that to enable the backward community people to come up, they must be made to realise that they had the right to claim equality with the so-called upper classes, and that, in fact, they had the right to claim proportionate representation in public offices. Thus, some of these themes constituted the platform of his future work. It should be said to the credit of Periyar that his repeated public meetings on the question of communal representation forced the government to pass G.O.No.1129 on 15 December 1928 by which Brahmins, non-Brahmins, Christians, Muslims and depressed classes were assured of proportionate representation in public offices. Periyar felt that the Brahmins, who formed a majority in the Indian National Congress and occupied the high posts, desired to dominate the party. Periyar was against the activities of the Brahmin leadership, which he felt, conspired to secure the high posts in the party for themselves and members of their community As soon as Periyar joined the Indian National Congress, he tried to introduce the usage of khadi. However, he soon got the impression that the Khadi Board Administration was dominated by Brahmins.

The light's wavelengths must be correctly matched to the ink‚Äôs photochemical properties. As a result, the ink droplets move to a higher viscosity state, but stop short of full cure. This is also referred to as the \\"gelling\\" of the ink. UV pinning is typically used in UV ink jet applications (e.g. the printing of labels, the printing of electronics, and the fabrication of 3-D microstructures).  Purpose  UV pinning enhances the management of drop size and image integrity, minimizing the unwanted mixing of drops and providing the highest possible image quality and the sharpest colour rendering. Challenge: Overcome the wetting problems that were causing UV-Curable inks to spread and cause ink droplets to bleed into each other before full curing single-pass digital printing of narrow web labels. Solution: A UV pinning system that uses high power UV light emitting diodes(LEDs) installed next to the inkjet array (print head). The UV light from the pinning system, typically lower than that of the full cure UV system, causes the UV ink to thicken, also known as gelling, but not fully cure. This ink thickening stops dot gain and holds the ink droplet pattern in place until it reaches the full cure UV system.

He served his sentence in federal prison, and was released from prison in 2015. As a result of the criminal charges he was also fired from the CIA.WARREN v. C.I.A. Early life, education, and career Warren has martial arts training, extensive knowledge of the Middle East, and speaks six Arabic dialects as well as Persian. Warren enrolled at Old Dominion University in 1986. He earned a Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude at Norfolk State University, graduating in 1993 with a 3.9 GPA. He studied history and political science at Indiana University in the summer of 1992, around which time he was spotted by a CIA on-campus agency recruiter. From 1994, he spent two summers continuing his Arabic studies at Yarmouk University in Jordan. In 1996, he was employed as a language analyst for the National Security Agency before being hired by the CIA. Warren's first undercover job was in Kuwait in 1999. He left the CIA in 2001, and took a job with Citigroup in New York City a month before the September 11 terrorist attack. He received a call from the CIA that day and was back working with the CIA the next day, where he worked in counter-terrorism in New York. In 2002, he was deployed to the Middle East, his mission was to collect intelligence. He returned to his New York counter- terrorism position in June 2003. In 2004, Warren was promoted to second in command of the CIA's Cairo bureau. He was stationed in Algeria since 2007 and recalled by the CIA in October 2008. He was fired in 2009.Ex-CIA Official Admits Rape at US Embassy in Algiers Criminal case In late 2008, two Algerian women came forward and accused Warren of drugging and raping them while at his home. On February 17, 2008, Warren admitted that he had sexually assaulted one of the women on the U.S. Embassy property in Algiers, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. He was indicted on June 18, 2009, by a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on one count of sexual abuse and was arraigned on June 30, 2009. He was investigated by the Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and prosecuted by attorneys from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Domestic Security Section.U.S. National Charged with Sexual Abuse While Overseas Warren was arrested April 26, 2010, in Norfolk, after he missed a pretrial appearance earlier in the month. He was in possession of a handgun and drug paraphernalia. On June 7, 2010, Warren pleaded guilty to abusive sexual contact and unlawful use of cocaine while possessing a firearm. Had he been convicted of the rape charge, for which he had originally been indicted, Warren could have faced up to life in prison. On March 3, 2011, Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle sentenced Warren to serve 65 months. The judge added almost two years to the sentence that prosecutors had originally requested, citing the rationale that it appeared that Warren believed he would get away with the offense because of diplomatic immunity as well as the victim's fear of reporting the crime.

It was on the line of the Via Appia, and was the last place where that great highroad touched on the sea-coast.Strabo v. p. 233. The ruins of the city are located in the modern-day municipality of Mondragone, Campania, Italy. History It is certain that Sinuessa was not an ancient city; indeed there is no trace of the existence of an Italic town on the spot before the foundation of the Roman colony. Some authorsLivy x. 21; Pliny the Elder iii. 5. s. 9.) mention an obscure tradition that there had previously been a Greek city on the spot called \\"Sinope\\"; but little value can be attached to this statement.It is certain that if it ever existed, it had wholly disappeared, and the site was included in the territory of the AusonianThe cities belonging to the league were Ausona, Vescia, Minturnae, Sinuessa and Suessa. However, there are various controversies about location and belonging. During the Latin war the cities of the league, like the Volsci and Campani, supported the Latins against Rome and their Samnite allies. The war, fought between 340 BC and 338 BC, ended with the victory of the Romans. The cities of the League fought again against Rome during the Second Samnite War which began in 326 BC. In 314 BC. the Romans won the cities of the League which were completely destroyed, but later founded the colonies of Sessa Aurunca and Minturnae, cities that retained the name and almost the position of those of the Aurunci. Sinuessa seems to have rapidly risen into a place of importance; but its territory was severely ravaged in 217 BCE by Hannibal, whose cavalry carried their devastations up to the very gates of the town.Livy xxii. 13, 14. It subsequently endeavored, in common with Minturnae and other coloniae maritimae, to establish its exemption from furnishing military levies; but this was overruled, while there was an enemy with an army in Italy. At a later period (191 BCE) Sinuessa again attempted, but with equal ill success, to procure a similar exemption from the naval service.Livy xxvii. 38, xxxvi. 3. Its position on the Appian Way doubtless contributed greatly to the prosperity of Sinuessa; for the same reason it is frequently incidentally mentioned by Cicero, and we learn that Julius Caesar halted there for a night on his way from Brundisium to Rome, in 49 BCE.Cicero Epistulae ad Atticum ix. 1. 5, 16, xiv. 8, Familiar Letters xii. 20. It is noticed also by Horace on his journey to Brundusium, as the place where he met with his friends Varius and Virgil.Sat. i. 5. 40. The fertility of its territory, and especially of the neighbouring ridge of the Mons Massicus, so celebrated for its wines, must also have tended to promote the prosperity of Sinuessa, but we hear little of it under the Roman Empire. It received a body of military colonists, apparently under the Triumvirate,Liber Coloniarum p. 237. but did not retain the rank of a colonia and is termed by Pliny as well as the Liber Coloniarum only an oppidum, or ordinary municipal town.Pliny iii. 5. s. 9; Lib. Col. l. c.. It was the furthest town in Latium, as that geographical term was understood in the days of Strabo and Pliny, or Latium adjectum, as the latter author terms it; and its territory extended to the river Savo, which formed the limit between Latium and Campania.Strabo v. pp. 219, 231, 233; Pliny iii. 5. s. 9; Mel. ii. 4. ¬ß 9. At an earlier period indeed Polybius reckoned it a town of Campania, and Ptolemy follows the same classification, as he makes the Liris the southern limit of Latium;Polybius iii. 91; Ptolomy iii. 1. ¬ß 6). but the division adopted by Strabo and Pliny is probably the most correct. The Itineraries all notice Sinuessa as a still existing town on the Appian Way, and place it nine miles from Minturnae, which is, however, considerably short of the true distance.Antonine Itinerary ¬ß 108; Itin. Hier. ¬ß 611; Tabula Peutingeriana. In his Meditations, written around AD 180, the emperor Marcus Aurelius notes that his friend Junius Rusticus sent a letter to Marcus's mother from Sinuessa. The period of its destruction is unknown. Ruins The ruins of Sinuessa are still visible on the seacoast of Mons_Massicus .(Baia Azzurra) - (Levagnole) is part of the municipality of Sessa Aurunca, in the province of Caserta, in the Campania region. The village of Baia Azzurra - Levagnole is 12.56 kilometers from the same town of Sessa Aurunca to which it belongs).The most important are those of an aqueduct, and of an edifice which appears to have been a triumphal arch; but the whole plain is covered with fragments of ancient buildings.Cluver. Ital. p. 1080; Romanelli, vol. iii. p. 486. Baths At a short distance from Sinuessa were the baths or thermal springs called Aquae Sinuessanae which appear to have enjoyed a great reputation among the Romans. Pliny tells us they were esteemed a remedy for barrenness in women and for insanity in men. They are already mentioned by Livy as early as the Second Punic War; and though their fame was eclipsed at a later period by those of Baiae and other fashionable watering-places, they still continued in use under the Empire, and were resorted to among others by the emperor Claudius.Livy xxii. 13; Tacitus Ann. xii. 66; Pliny xxxi. 2. s. 4. It was there, also, that the infamous Tigellinus was compelled to put an end to his own life.Tacitus Hist. i. 72; Plutarch Otho 2. The mild and warm climate of Sinuessa is extolled by some writers as contributing to the effect of the waters (Tacitus Annals xii. 66); hence it is called Sinuessa tepens by Silius Italicus, and mollis Sinuessa by Martial.Silius Italicus viii. 528; Martial vi. 42. The site of the waters is still called I Bagni, and the remains of Roman buildings still exist there. In popular culture In the Starz series Spartacus: War of the Damned, Spartacus and his rebel army invade and take Sinuessa during the second episode, \\"Wolves at the Gate\\", and hold it in subsequent episodes.

It housed Daniels, Eglin, and Company, dry goods merchants, from 1852 until 1865. In 1865 the property was purchased for $50,000 by Isaac Goldsmith, of Goldsmith, Frohlichstein, and Company. The new four-story building with a cast iron facade was completed in 1866. The facade was cast by Daniel D. Badger's Architectural Iron Works in New York City. The Isaac Goldsmith and William Frohlichstein business partnership had ended by 1867, Goldsmith had become president of the Mobile Commercial Savings Company and Frohlichstein had formed a new dry goods company known as Frohlichstein, Hahn and Company. The building was occupied by this firm, as well as by J. Brisk and Company. In 1869 J. Brisk and Company became Brisk & Jacobson, headquartered in Plainfield, New Jersey. It specialized in wholesale and retail men's apparel. The building continued as the Brisk & Jacobson Store until 1893. After that date a succession of commercial enterprises were housed there.

Its stated mission is \\"...to catalyze the computing research community and enable the pursuit of innovative, high-impact research\\". The CCC conducts activities that strengthen the research community, articulate compelling research visions, and align those visions with pressing national and global challenges. The CCC communicates the importance of those visions to policymakers, government and industry stakeholders, the public, and the research community itself. History In March 2006, the National Science Foundation (NSF) issued a solicitation indicating its desire to establish a Computing Community Consortium. In October of that year, CRA responded to the solicitation, submitting a proposal that was backed by explicit letters of support from 132 Ph.D.-granting academic programs, 16 leading corporations, 7 major national laboratories and research centers, and five professional societies in the field. Pursuant to positive external peer review, the CCC was established in late 2006 through a cooperative agreement between NSF and CRA. An interim CCC Council was appointed by the proposal team in December 2006. Following an open recruitment process, Ed Lazowska (University of Washington) was selected as Chair of the CCC Council in March 2007. The membership of the inaugural CCC Council was selected through a transparent process and announced in June 2007. The first public activity of the CCC was a set of five plenary talks at the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC 2007) that month. Early on, CCC Council member Susan Graham assumed the role of Vice Chair. Andrew Bernat, CRA's Executive Director, served the CCC in the role of staff Director until Erwin Gianchandani was recruited as full-time staff Director in April 2010. Ann Drobnis took over as Director in March 2013. Current Structure Today, the CCC Council has 20 members on 3-year staggered terms, representing the diverse nature of the computing research field. Liz Bradley serves as Chair and Dan Lopresti serves as Vice-Chair. The CCC operates as a programmatic committee of CRA under CRA's bylaws: its membership only slightly overlaps the CRA's Board of Directors; it has significant autonomy, and it has a great deal of synergistic mutual benefit with CRA. The CCC Council meets three times every calendar year, including at least one meeting in Washington, D.C., and has biweekly conference calls between these meetings. Also, the CCC leadership has biweekly conference calls with the leadership of NSF‚Äôs Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE). The CCC is broadly inclusive, and any computing researcher who wishes to become involved is encouraged to do so. For example, each winter, the CCC issues a call for nominations for Council members effective the following July.

Nevertheless, Matisoff (2013) accepts Burling's Sal group, and considers *s-ra≈ã 'sky/rain' and *nu 'mother' to be the most convincing Sal innovations. The family is generally presented with three branches (, ): * The Bodo‚ÄìGaro languages, including the Bodo and Koch languages, are spoken in the northeast Indian states of Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura. * The Konyak languages are spoken by the Naga people in southeastern Arunachal Pradesh and northeastern Nagaland (both in northeastern India). This group is called Eastern Naga by and Northern Naga by other authors. (The remaining languages of Nagaland belong to the separate Kuki-Chin-Naga group.) * The Kachinic or Jingpho‚ÄìLuish languages include Jingpho (Jinghpaw, Singhpo or Kachin), spoken in northern Burma and adjacent regions, and the Luish (or Sak) languages spoken in western Burma. Shafer had grouped the first two as his Baric division, and also combines them as a subbranch.

During his senior season, Tsoumpas helped Weber State allow the fewest sacks in the conference, he also helped Trevyn Smith lead the Big Sky in rushing yards for the second year in a row. He was named Second Team All-Big Sky. Professional career=Calgary Stampeders= At the 2008 CFL Draft Evaluation Camp, Tsoumpas benched 30 times to be one the leaders in that category at the camp. He was considered a possible top pick in the draft, however it was heavily rumored he could try to make an NFL team. A few days before the draft, the Edmonton Eskimos were reportedly considering Tsoumpas, Keith Shologan and Samuel Giguere. However Shologan and Giguere signed contracts with NFL teams. After a draft day trade with the Edmonton Eskimos, the Calgary Stampeders acquired the second overall pick in the 2008 CFL Draft and used it to draft Tsoumpas. He was named the starting right guard, while fellow rookie Jesse Newman was the starting left guard. He debuted for Calgary, in week one against the BC Lions. Tsoumpas started all 18 games including all playoff games which included the 96th Grey Cup. He helped Calgary's running backs average 134.6 yards per game with 6.4 yards per carry. He was also key in helping the Stampeders allow the fewest sacks in the CFL. Joffrey Reynolds the CFL's leading rusher gained 1,310 yards with the help of Tsoumpas. Following the season he was Calgary's nominee for the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie award. Tsoumpas was expected to remain a starter in 2009. After sustaining a concussion during the 2013 CFL season, Tsoumpas announced his retirement on January 29, 2014. =Miami Dolphins= Tsoumpas agreed to terms with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League on January 8, 2010. Tsoumpas was waived on July 30 and returned to the Calgary Stampeders.

He has published two novels concerning fictional LDS missionaries, entitled The MTC: Set Apart and Into the Field, as well as a biography of S. Dilworth Young, an LDS general authority. In the mid-1990s he became involved in the Association for Mormon Letters (AML), primarily by creating an email forum for the discussion of LDS literature called AML-List, for which he was awarded the 2000 AML Award for Criticism. Parkinson then co- founded the literary journal Irreantum and served as co-editor for a year. His criticism of LDS literature has been featured in multiple publications. He is a graduate of Brigham Young University. Personal life Parkinson was born in Provo, Utah. He served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints in France. In 1985 he graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Comparative Literature. He and his wife Robin are the parents of five children and live in Ogden, Utah.  Career = Writing = Parkinson's novel The MTC: Set Apart was published by Aspen Books in 1995. It follows four new LDS missionaries as they enter the Missionary Training Center. Robert M. Hogge praised the \\"rich language, symbolism, ... and allusion\\" present in The MTC, but writer Brian Evensen called the novel's characters stereotypical and the dialogue \\"hackneyed and predictable.\\" Parkinson continued the missionaries' story with 2000's Into the Field, which follows the four young men as they travel to France. In a review in Irreantum, Neal Kramer commended the realistic nature of the novel, saying: \\"I wondered whether I was reading a novel or a memoir. I had to shake myself a little to remember I was reading LDS fiction.\\" Parkinson has also published a biography of his grandfather S. Dilworth Young, a member of the Quorum of the Seventy, entitled S. Dilworth Young: General Authority, Scouter, Poet. The author presented this work at the AML's symposium that year. In a review for the Journal of Mormon History, Gary Huxford called the biography \\"a good read that deserves a wide audience,\\" citing Parkinson's inexperience as a biographer as both a strength and a weakness to the work overall. In 1996, Parkinson hosted a session at the Fourth Annual LDS Writers Conference entitled \\"How to Sell Your LDS Novel.\\" In addition to full-length books, Parkinson has written reviews and articles about Latter-day Saint fiction, many of which have been published in issues of Irreantum. The 1998 edition of AML Annual featured his essay \\"Electric Talk: Twenty Months of AML-List.\\" \\"The Deseret School and the Missionary School,\\" Parkinson's take on the different approaches to LDS writing, was published in the first volume of Irreantum in 1999. In addition to publishing such essays, Parkinson worked as an editor for the Church Educational System in the early 2000s. = The Association for Mormon Letters = Beginning in the mid-1990s, Parkinson was an active participant in the Association for Mormon Letters (AML). In 1995, he created AML-List, an email forum for the discussion of LDS literature sponsored by the association. He also served as moderator until the year 2000. The forum received an average of 30 posts per day, which included reviews of various LDS films and books. Over time, AML-List received more than 1000 entries from users. The current review archive is http://associationmormonletters.org/blog/reviews/ Parkinson wanted to facilitate an energetic environment that would allow people with different interests to share their opinions. During this time, he also worked on AML- List Magazine, which showcased authors' works online. Parkinson won the 2000 AML Award for Criticism for his work on AML-List: including establishing the forum, moderating it, editing thousands of posts, and creating regular columns of literary news and reviews. Then, in 1999, he co-founded the literary magazine Irreantum with Chris Bigelow. The publication featured some content first produced on AML-List as well as \\"original fiction, poetry, essays, reviews, interviews, and literary news.\\" Parkinson and Bigelow were Irreantum's first co-editors, with Parkinson serving as the first reader of submissions and collaborator with the editing staff. Similar to his goal of inclusivity for AML-List, Parkinson wanted the magazine \\"to give broad coverage and support to every sort of Mormon literature and to promote all kinds.\\" During this time he also served as an ex officio board member of the AML. He ended his time as co-editor after the Summer 2000 issue.

The film was directed by William Beaudine and stars W. C. Fields. The script was written by Jack Cunningham based on a story by \\"Charles Bogle\\" (one of Fields's writing pseudonyms). Synopsis In 1897, a blustery actor- manager, \\"The Great McGonigle\\" (W. C. Fields), and his traveling theater troupe is perpetually underfunded and always just a step ahead of the law and creditors. McGonigle's daughter Betty (Judith Allen) is loyal to her father, and she tries to discourage a suitor named Wally Livingston (Joe Morrison), telling him he should follow his own father's wishes and go to college instead of trying to become an actor. Along with the rest of the troupe is McGonigle's rather dim-witted assistant Marmaduke (Tammany Young). Wally's wealthy father (Oscar Apfel) arrives in the town where the troupe is scheduled to perform a Victorian melodrama, William H. Smith's popular temperance play, The Drunkard. One of the players has resigned, and Wally wins the part, affording him a chance to act and also to perform a couple of songs in his strong tenor voice. His father is impressed by his son's talent, and his skepticism about Betty is eased when he learns that she has been trying to get Wally to return to college. McGonigle has an eye on Cleopatra Pepperday (Jan Duggan), a wealthy and untalented widow, and her infant son (Baby LeRoy), and exploits her to stave off the local sheriff, who is Pepperday's boyfriend. To secure her support, McGonigle promises her a cameo role in The Drunkard, with one line: \\"Here comes the prince.\\" The play has no reference to any prince of course, and act after act comes and goes with her rehearsing her line in fond hope, but her cue never comes. At the end of the play, distraught and crying, she goes off to get the sheriff. After the play concludes, McGonigle comes onstage and performs a juggling act. McGonigle then learns that the troupe's sponsor is canceling the tour, due to poor advance reports. McGonigle tells Betty and Wally that he has decided to close the show and to seek his fortune in New York City. The bride and groom and his father ride the train back to the Livingston home, and Betty gets a telegram from her father stating that things are going well in the big city. In reality, McGonigle has become a snake-oil salesman. Cast *W. C.

Stolonifera is a section of ten tuberous perennial species in the genus Drosera that are endemic to south-west Western Australia. The species all have a similar growth habit and all have fan-shaped leaves, but the morphological differences and lack of natural hybrids support the division of the D. stolonifera species complex.Lowrie, A. 2005. A taxonomic revision of Drosera section Stolonifera (Droseraceae), from south-west Western Australia. Nuytsia, 15(3): 355-393. Taxonomy The first species in the section was discovered by Charles von H√ºgel in the Swan River region in 1833. D. stolonifera was formally described by Stephan Endlicher in 1837. Johann Georg Christian Lehmann followed that with two more species in 1844: D. ramellosa and D. porrecta. In 1848, Jules √âmile Planchon organized these three species under section Ergaleium series Erythrorhizae subseries Stoloniferae (initially spelled Stolmiferae). Planchon also added the species D. humilis and D. penduliflora (later reduced to synonymy under D. ramellosa) to the new subseries. D. platypoda was added in 1854 by Nicolai Stepanovitch Turczaninow and D. purpurascens, described by August Friedrich Schlotthauber followed in 1856. In 1864, George Bentham reorganized the species under section Ergaleium, recognized fewer taxa, and suggested the reclassification of D. humilis as a variety of D. stolonifera. In 1906, Ludwig Diels took Bentham's suggestion and reduced D. humilis to the variety rank. In Diels' monograph of the family, he reorganized the species in this section into subgenus Ergaleium section Erythrorhiza. The next new member of the section came when Larry Eugene DeBuhr described D. fimbriata in 1975. Two years later DeBuhr re-evaluated the classification of subgenus Ergaleium and established the current three sections and also formally established the current section Stolonifera, which was based on Planchon's subseries Stoloniferae. At this point, section Stolonifera contained four species: D. fimbriata, D. platypoda, D. ramellosa, and D. stolonifera. In 1982, N. G. Marchant's treatment of the section included DeBuhr's four species but also four subspecies of D. stolonifera. Subsequent publications identified three additional subspecies of D. stolonifera, two of which were new taxa. Allen Lowrie, one of the coauthors of some of those subspecies, elevated all of the D. stolonifera subspecies to species rank, bringing the total number of species in the section to ten. In his 2005 revision of the section, however, he neglected to include a full basionym citation when elevating D. stolonifera subsp. monticola to D. monticola, thus rendering the new species name invalid due to Article 33.4 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Therefore, the section then had nine species with two accepted subspecies of D. stolonifera, which includes the autonym D. stolonifera subsp. stolonifera. Lowrie corrected this error in a short note in the 2011 volume of the journal Nuytsia where he provided the correct page number for the basionym and finally validated the name Drosera monticola, bringing the total number of species to ten.Lowrie, Allen. 2011.

The girl that came in to have her picture taken incidentally looked \\"like a miniature Susan\\" to Everett, a girlfriend of his a few years before and the subject of the song \\"Susan's House\\".  Release  Beautiful Freak was released on August 13, 1996, by record label DreamWorks, the first album released on the label. The album peaked at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart.

The April 1997 German release of the album included a bonus live EP from a BBC recording session.  Reception  In a contemporary review of Beautiful Freak, Q praised the album as \\"a complete musical vision, a genre-spanning soundscape that reels you in with its myriad hooks\\". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Eels' maverick vision reminds you of all the great Los Angeles bands, from the Flying Burrito Brothers to X, that have chronicled the outsider, underdog attitude in the shadows of a record industry that never embraces them commercially.\\" Ethan Smith of Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"the Eels' postgrunge pop melodies and quirky, intelligent production make for catchy modern rock that's miles ahead of the competition\\", but felt that E's \\"attempts at warts-and-all portrayals of urban life come off as a disingenuous, arty pose\\" and that \\"a little less pretension would get these guys a lot further.\\" Chicago Tribune critic Mark Caro was less favorable, writing that E's lyrics paint him as \\"either naive and self-absorbed or patronizing and calculating\\". The Village Voices Robert Christgau assigned the album a \\"dud\\" rating, indicating \\"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.\\" In his retrospective review, James Chrispell of AllMusic wrote: \\"Concise pop tunes form the backbone of the album, yet tinges of despair and downright meanness surface just when you've been lulled into thinking this is another pop group\\".

The main objective of the game is to collect keys which unlock the level exits, as well as coins and jewels along the way. The game makes use of alternative physics, changing the direction of gravity as the ball moves. Gameplay Various elements and obstacles are introduced as one moves on to new levels, which means that the complexity and level of puzzle solving required gradually increases as the game progresses. The game involves making ingenious use of the various types of platforms and surrounding objects, from moving platforms and transporters to bouncing platforms and jumping pills. Bonus levels can be unlocked by gathering five fruits (one available in each stage). If one enters a bonus level, the word \\"BONUS\\" appears. Completing the bonus stage requires one to 'activate' all the cubes on all platforms by rolling over them. The bonus stages also become more complex as the game progresses. Points are awarded when the player collects keys, treasures, and fruits and also when they complete levels. Points are deducted if the Kula ball is spiked, captured, melted, burnt by a laser, falls/slides off or simply runs out of time, all of which require the player to restart the level - providing the score has not fallen below zero, in which case, the game ends. A two-player mode is available, with two variations of the game. A time trial and a version called \\"copycat\\". In the time trial the players take turns to determine who can complete each stage in the quickest time possible. The \\"copycat\\" version is a kind of memory tester. It involves one player starting off making two moves, and the next player then copies those moves and adds two of their own. The first player then has to copy all of the moves so far and add two more moves at the end. This continues until one of the players makes a mistake, after which the opponent is awarded a point. A move constitutes either changing direction, moving forward or jumping (either on the spot/forwards or onto another platform). Release This was one of the first games to make use of the DualShock vibration function of the original PlayStation game controllers, which induces the feel of the ground breaking, the feeling of the Kula ball about to burst, or the shock of getting suddenly captured or spiked. The game also featured an original, easy listening style soundtrack composed entirely by long-running Swedish electronica group Twice a Man. Kula World was released for download to PlayStation 3 via PlayStation Store, on 29 November 2007. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe also released a direct emulation of Kula World on Google Play for Android in 2011. Reception Kula World received generally positive reviews from video game publications. Edge praised the game for gradually introducing new challenges as the player advances through the stages, comparing the game's progression to a \\"good Nintendo title\\". However, the magazine criticized the game's lack of replay value and the multiplayer mode for not offering split screen gameplay.

In addition to many exploits she was known for being an acquaintance of Wild Bill Hickok. Late in her life, she appeared in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show and at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition. She is said to have exhibited compassion to others, especially to the sick and needy. This facet of her character contrasted with her daredevil ways and helped to make her a noted frontier figure. She was also known for her habit of wearing men's attire.  Early life  Marker east of Princeton indicating the most widely believed location of her birth. The site was later occupied by a Premium Standard Farms hog farm. Much of the information about the early years of Calamity Jane's life comes from an autobiographical booklet that she dictated in 1896, written for publicity purposes. It was intended to help attract audiences to a tour she was about to begin, in which she appeared in dime museums around the United States. Some of the information in the pamphlet is exaggerated or even completely inaccurate. Calamity Jane was born on May 1, 1852, as Martha Jane Canary (or Cannary) in Princeton, within Mercer County, Missouri. Her parents were listed in the 1860 census as living about northeast of Princeton in Ravanna. Her father Robert Wilson Cannary had a gambling problem, and little is known about her mother Charlotte M. Cannary. Jane was the eldest of six children, and had two brothers and three sisters. In 1865, Robert and his family moved by wagon train from Missouri to Virginia City, Montana. In 1866, Charlotte died of pneumonia along the way, in Blackfoot, Montana. After arriving in Virginia City in the spring of 1866, Robert took his six children on to Salt Lake City, Utah. They arrived in the summer, and Robert supposedly started farming on of land. The family had been in Salt Lake City for only a year when he died in 1867. At age 14, Martha Jane took charge of her five younger siblings, loaded up their wagon once more, and took the family to Fort Bridger, Wyoming Territory, where they arrived in May 1868. From there, they traveled on the Union Pacific Railroad to Piedmont, Wyoming. In Piedmont, Jane took whatever jobs she could find to provide for her large family. She worked as a dishwasher, cook, waitress, dance hall girl, nurse, and ox team driver. Finally, in 1874, she claimed she found work as a scout at Fort Russell. During that time, she also began her on-and-off employment as a prostitute at the Fort Laramie Three-Mile Hog Ranch. She moved on to a rougher, mostly outdoor and adventurous life on the Great Plains.  Acquiring the nickname  1885 photos of Calamity Jane Jane was involved in several campaigns in the long-running military conflicts with Native Americans. Her claim was that: Captain Jack Crawford served under Generals Wesley Merritt and George Crook. According to the Montana Anaconda Standard of April 19, 1904, he stated that Calamity Jane \\"never saw service in any capacity under either General Crook or General Miles. She never saw a lynching and never was in an Indian fight. She was simply a notorious character, dissolute and devilish, but possessed a generous streak which made her popular.\\" A popular belief is that she instead acquired it as a result of her warnings to men that to offend her was to \\"court calamity\\". It is possible that \\"Jane\\" was not part of her name until the nickname was coined for her. It is certain, however, that she was known by that nickname by 1876, because the arrival of the Hickok wagon train was reported in Deadwood's newspaper, the Black Hills Pioneer, on July 15, 1876, with the headline: \\"Calamity Jane has arrived!\\" Another account in her autobiographical pamphlet is that her detachment was ordered to the Big Horn River under General Crook in 1875. She swam the Platte River and travelled at top speed while wet and cold in order to deliver important dispatches. She became ill afterwards and spent a few weeks recuperating. She then rode to Fort Laramie in Wyoming and joined a wagon train headed north in July 1876. The second part of her story is verified. She was at Fort Laramie in July 1876, and she did join a wagon train that included Wild Bill Hickok. That was where she first met Hickok, contrary to her later claims, and that was how she happened to come to Deadwood.  Deadwood and Wild Bill Hickok  Calamity Jane accompanied the Newton‚ÄìJenney Party into Rapid City in 1875, along with California Joe and Valentine McGillycuddy. In 1876, Calamity Jane settled in the area of Deadwood, South Dakota, in the Black Hills. There she became friends with Dora DuFran, the Black Hills' leading madam, and was occasionally employed by her. Jane tried to become friendly with Wild Bill Hickok and Charlie Utter. She traveled to see them in Deadwood in Utter's wagon train. She arrived day after Wild Bill was murdered in a card game. She never met Wild Bill. = McCormick claim = On September 6, 1941, the U.S. Department of Public Welfare granted old age assistance to a Jean Hickok Burkhardt McCormick who claimed to be the legal offspring of Martha Jane Cannary and James Butler Hickok. She presented evidence that Calamity Jane and Wild Bill had married at Benson's Landing, Montana Territory (now Livingston, Montana) on September 25, 1873. The documentation was written in a Bible and presumably signed by two ministers and numerous witnesses. However, McCormick's claim has been vigorously challenged because of a variety of discrepancies. McCormick later published a book with letters purported to be from Calamity Jane to her daughter. In them, Calamity Jane says she had been married to Hickok and that Hickok was the father of McCormick, who was born September25, 1873, and was given up for adoption to a Captain Jim O'Neil and his wife. During the period when the alleged child was born, Calamity Jane was allegedly working as a scout for the army, and at the time of Hickok's death, he had recently married Agnes Lake Thatcher. Calamity Jane does seem to have had two daughters, although the father's identity is unknown. In the late 1880s, Jane returned to Deadwood with a child whom she claimed was her daughter. At Jane's request, a benefit was held in one of the theaters to raise money for her daughter's education in St. Martin's Academy at Sturgis, South Dakota, a nearby Catholic boarding school. The benefit raised a large sum; Jane got drunk and spent a considerable portion of the money that same night and left with the child the next day. Estelline Bennett was living in Deadwood at that time and had spoken briefly with Jane a few days before the benefit. She thought that Jane honestly wanted her daughter to have an education and that the drunken binge was just an example of her inability to curb her impulses and carry through long-range plans (which Bennett saw as typical of Jane's class). Bennett later heard that Jane's daughter did \\"get an education, and grew up and married well\\".Estelline Bennet, Old Deadwood Days, p. 229-32, 240‚Äì42. Quote from p. 242. Lincoln Nebraska & London: Bison Books, University of Nebraska Press, 1982. Reprint of J. H. Sears edition (New York), 1928. = After the death of Wild Bill Hickok = Jane also claimed that, following Hickok's death, she went after his murderer Jack McCall with a meat cleaver, since she had left her guns at her residence. Following McCall's execution for the crime, Jane continued living in the Deadwood area for some time, and at one point she helped save numerous passengers in an overland stagecoach by diverting several Plains Indians who were in pursuit of the vehicle. Stagecoach driver John Slaughter was killed during the pursuit, and Jane took over the reins and drove the stage on to its destination at Deadwood. In late 1876 or 1878, Jane nursed the victims of a smallpox epidemic in the Deadwood area.  Final years  Calamity Jane shares a drink with Teddy Blue Abbott, circa 1887Deadwood, Dakota Territory. In 1881, Jane bought a ranch west of Miles City, Montana along the Yellowstone River, where she kept an inn. According to one version of her life, she later married Clinton Burke from Texas and moved to Boulder, where she once again made an attempt in the inn business. In 1887, she gave birth to a daughter, Jesse, who was adopted by foster parents. She is also said to have traveled with a young girl briefly whom she said was her daughter but there is no evidence supporting her ever having a child. In 1893, Calamity Jane started to appear in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show as a storyteller. She also participated in the 1901 Pan-American Exposition. At that time, she was depressed and an alcoholic. Her addiction to liquor was evident even in her younger years. For example, on June 10, 1876, she rented a horse and buggy in Cheyenne for a one-mile joy ride to Fort Russell and back, but she was so drunk that she passed right by her destination without noticing it and finally ended up about away at Fort Laramie. Death Jane returned to the Black Hills in the spring of 1903, and brothel owner Madame Dora DuFran was still running her business. For the next few months, Jane earned her keep by cooking and doing the laundry for Dora's brothel girls in Belle Fourche. In late July, Jane travelled by ore train to Terry, South Dakota, a small mining village near Deadwood, and stayed at the Calloway Hotel. She died at the age of 51. It was reported that she had been drinking heavily while on board the train and had become sick to her stomach. The conductor, S.G. Tillett, carried her off the train, a bartender secured a room for her at the Calloway Hotel, and a doctor was summoned. Jane died almost immediately afterwards on Saturday, August 1, 1903, from inflammation of the bowels and pneumonia. A bundle of unsent letters to her daughter was allegedly found among Jane's few belongings. Composer Libby Larsen set some of these letters to music in an art song cycle called Songs From Letters (1989). Those letters were first made public by Jean McCormick as part of her claim to be the daughter of Jane and Hickok, but their authenticity is not accepted by some, largely because there is ample evidence that Jane was functionally illiterate. Calamity Jane was buried at Mount Moriah Cemetery, South Dakota, next to Wild Bill Hickok. Four of the men who planned her funeralFrank Ankeney, Jim Carson, Anson Higby, and Albert Malter later stated that Wild Bill Hickok had \\"absolutely no use\\" for Jane while he was alive, so they decided to play a posthumous joke on him by burying her by his side. Another account states: \\"in compliance with Jane's dying requests, the Society of Black Hills Pioneers took charge of her funeral and burial in Mount Moriah Cemetery beside Wild Bill. Not just old friends, but the morbidly curious and many who would not have acknowledged Calamity Jane when she was alive, overflowed the First Methodist Church for the funeral services on August 4 and followed the hearse up the steep winding road to Deadwood‚Äôs boot hill\\".  Major media representations = Films = The Plainsman is a 1936 film starring Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickok and Jean Arthur as Calamity Jane.

This series, written by Edward Wheeler, established her with a reputation as a Wild West heroine and probably did more to enhance her familiarity to the public than any of her real life exploits. (There is no evidence that she was consulted by Wheeler or approved the Deadwood Dick stories, so the character in the stories was entirely fictitious ‚Äì as were the events described, but the fictional adventures were muddled in the public mind with the real Jane.) Calamity Jane was the title character in a serial published in New York's Street & Smith's Weekly (1882) under the title, Calamity Jane: Queen of the Plains, by the author \\"Reckless Ralph\\". The science fiction writer A. Bertram Chandler included a character named Calamity Jane Arlen in his far future novels set on the frontier Rim Worlds, a space analogue of the Old West. A fictitious fight between Calamity Jane and an impostor is depicted in Thomas Berger's novel Little Big Man (1964). Jane is the central character in Larry McMurtry's book Buffalo Girls: A Novel (1990). Jane is a central character in Pete Dexter's novel Deadwood (1986). J. T. Edson features Calamity Jane as a character in a number of his books, as a stand-alone character (in Cold Deck, Hot Lead, Calamity Spells Trouble, Trouble Trail, The Bull Whip Breed, The Cow Thieves, The Whip And The War Lance and The Big Hunt) and as a romantic interest of the character Mark Counter (in The Wildcats, The Bad Bunch, Guns In The Night and others). An alternative universe version of Jane is a character in the short story \\"Deadwood\\" in Corsets and Clockwork (2011), a steampunk anthology. The story also features Jesse James. In Calamity's Wake (2013), a novel of historical fiction written by Natalee Caple, Martha, or Calamity Jane, is one of two main narrators; the other is Jane's daughter Miette. Calamity Jane, l√©gende de l'Ouest, written by Gregory Monro (2010), is the only French biography to this day. Calamity Jane appears in Michael Crichton's novel Dragon Teeth (2017).  Comics  Calamity Jane figures as a main character in an album of the same name of the Franco-Belgian comics series Lucky Luke, created by Morris and Ren√© Goscinny. Also, she features in the album Ghosthunt, created by Morris and Lo Hartog van Banda. Graphic novel Calamity Jane - The Calamitous Life of Martha Jane Cannary, 1852-1903 (IDW Publishing, 2017) by and is a biography of Calamity Jane, mostly based on Calamity Jane's Letters to Her Daughter. = Music = Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok are featured in the song \\"Deadwood Mountain\\" by the country duo Big & Rich. Some of her purported letters were set to music in an art-song cycle by 20th-century composer Libby Larsen, called \\"Songs From Letters\\". Soprano Dora Ohrenstein commissioned five pieces compiled under the title Urban Diva, the second piece, Ben Johnston's Calamity Jane to Her Daughter is a theatrical setting of selected letters. \\"Calamity Jane\\" is a song by Grant- Lee Phillips on \\"Virginia Creeper\\" (2004). \\"Calamity Jane\\" is a song by Kiya Heartwood on Wishing Chair's Underdog CD (2005). Alain Bashung, Chlo√© Mons, Rodolphe Burger released the album La Ballade de Calamity Jane (2006) based on Jane's letters to her daughter. \\"Kalamity Jane\\" is a song by Czech rock band Kab√°t. \\"Calamity Jane\\" is a song by Chris Anderson on his album \\"The Crown\\" (2004). The 1953 movie \\"Calamity Jane\\" with Doris Day and Howard Keel features the song, \\"My Secret Love\\" which won the 1954 Academy Award for \\"Best Music Original Song\\". Calamity Jane is mentioned in the 2016 song \\"The Lighter\\" by the French pop-rock band Superbus, from the album \\"Sixtape\\". = Television = The name \\"Calamity\\" is given to the children's character played by Nancy Gilbert in the 1955‚Äì1956 syndicated television series, Buffalo Bill, Jr., with Dick Jones as the fictitious Buffalo Bill, Jr., and Harry Cheshire as Judge Ben \\"Fair and Square\\" Wiley. In the episode \\"Calamity\\" (December 13, 1959) of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, Colt .45, Dody Heath is cast as Calamity Jane and Joan Taylor as a woman doctor, Ellen McGraw. In the story line, series character Christopher Colt, played by Wayde Preston, hires Calamity Jane to drive the stagecoach containing Dr. McGraw and the vaccine needed for the smallpox outbreak in Deadwood. Colt is unsure if Calamity can handle the job because miners and Indians seek to steal the valuable medication. Season 5 of Have Gun, Will Travel included an episode called \\"The Cure\\" (first broadcast on May 20, 1961) with an alcoholic Jane (Norma Crane as \\"Martha Jane Conroy\\") seeking revenge on a promoter who had replaced the \\"real\\" Jane with a younger woman. In an episode of Bonanza, \\"Calamity Over the Comstock\\" (1963), Stefanie Powers plays Calamity Jane, who visits Virginia City along with Doc Holliday. In this primarily comedic episode, she is rescued by Little Joe, who at first thinks she is a male. She becomes infatuated with him, and he receives threats from Doc, who covets Jane for himself. At her urging (and threat), Doc demurs from facing down Joe, and Jane and Doc exit town. No official or unofficial documentation exists suggesting that Doc Holliday and Jane ever met during their lifetimes. It is highly unlikely that they met considering the geographical distances between them during their lives. In an episode of the television show Death Valley Days, \\"A Calamity Named Jane\\", Fay Spain plays Calamity Jane as she joins Wild Bill Hickok's (Rhodes Reasons) show. Her uncouth behavior causes Bill to think he made a mistake, and when Bill tells her she should \\"act like a lady\\" he soon realizes he made a bigger mistake. In the 1966 Batman series, one of the villains in season three was named \\"Calamity Jan\\" (played by Dina Merrill). The television movie Calamity Jane (1984) featured her life story, including her alleged marriage to Wild Bill Hickok and the daughter she purportedly gave up. Actress Jane Alexander portrayed Calamity and was nominated for an Emmy in 1985 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Special. The show also featured an early performance of Sara Gilbert as Calamity's daughter, Jean, at age 7. Jane is the central character in Larry McMurtry's book Buffalo Girls: A Novel (1990), and in the 1995 TV adaptation of the same name, Jane is played by Anjelica Huston, with Sam Elliott as Wild Bill Hickok. In 1997 a cartoon series on Kids' WB, The Legend of Calamity Jane, depicted a young Jane (voiced by Barbara Weber Scaff). Robin Weigert portrayed Calamity Jane in the HBO series Deadwood (2004-2006) and in the HBO sequel Deadwood: The Movie (2019).

The museum staff were able to reconstruct the original position of the bones only because the blocks of peat containing the bones could be matched to the holes where they were removed from the bog. The skull and two bones were found at a depth of , but the majority of the bones were found in a depth of , at a distance of from the other bones. A thigh bone was found a further to the southeast. Study of the remains The complete skeleton of the man was not found. The anthropological investigation revealed by study of the bones, that the man was tall and 20 to 25 years old. No signs of disease or malnutrition could be identified on the bones and the preservation of the original full set of teeth also had no pathological signs such as tooth decay. An analysis based on samples from the bones pointed towards a diet of plants and land-based animals, with little or no seafood. A strontium isotope analysis revealed that he likely grew up in Funen, the island where the remains were found. An early DNA analysis revealed no useful results. The few found DNA traces were probably from contamination by people handling the remains. Later DNA studies based on samples from the molar teeth revealed in 2016 that the person, long considered a woman, was in fact a man.Pedersen, K.L. (2 April 2017).

The distribution of bones over a larger area is understandable if the man drowned in the lake: the soft tissues of the corpse may have decayed while floating in open water, allowing disarticulation of the body. The remaining parts sank and were enclosed by lake silt. In July 1941, a pollen analysis was performed from the inside of the skull. The bog body could be dated to the time of Maglemosian culture around 8000 BC. In October 1943, at the site a bore sample was taken for further investigations. A Carbon 14 test, confirmed in 1983, dated the time of death to the Maglemosian culture.

As the head of the Branch Davidians sect, an offshoot of the Davidian Seventh-Day Adventist Church, Koresh claimed to be its final prophet. Coming from a dysfunctional background, Koresh was a member and later a leader of the Branch Davidians, a movement originally led by Benjamin Roden, based at the Mount Carmel Center outside Waco, Texas. Here, Koresh competed for dominance with another leader, Benjamin Roden's son George, until the younger Roden was jailed for murdering yet another rival. Early life David Koresh was born Vernon Wayne Howell on August 17, 1959, in Houston, Texas, to a 14-year-old single mother, Bonnie Sue Clark (1944‚Äì2009) and father Bobby Wayne Howell (1939‚Äì2008). Before Koresh was born, his father met another teenaged girl and abandoned Bonnie Sue. Koresh never met his father, and his mother began cohabitating with a violent alcoholic. In 1963, Koresh's mother left with her boyfriend and placed her four-year-old son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Earline Clark. His mother returned when he was seven, after her marriage to a carpenter named Roy Haldeman. Bonnie Sue and Haldeman had a son together, named Roger, who was born in 1966. Koresh described his early childhood as lonely. Due to his poor study skills and dyslexia, he was put in special education classes and nicknamed \\"Vernie\\" by his fellow students.Final 24 Episode on David Koresh . Koresh dropped out of Garland High School in his junior year. When he was 19 years old, Koresh had a legal (at the time) sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl, who became pregnant. He claimed to have become a born-again Christian in the Southern Baptist Church and soon joined his mother's church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church. There, Koresh became infatuated with the pastor's daughter, and while praying for guidance, he opened his eyes and allegedly found the Bible open at Isaiah 34:16, stating that \\"none should want for her mate\\"; convinced this was a sign from God, Koresh approached the pastor and told him that God wanted him to have his daughter for a wife. The pastor threw him out, and when he continued to persist with his pursuit of the daughter, he was expelled from the congregation. In 1981, Koresh moved to Waco, Texas, where he joined the Branch Davidians (not to be confused with the original Davidian Seventh-Day Adventist Church). Benjamin Roden, who died in 1978, originated the Branch group in 1955 with new teachings that were not connected with the original Davidians. Koresh played guitar and sang in church services at the Mount Carmel Center, the sect's headquarters outside Waco. Ascent to leadership of the Branch Davidians In 1983, Koresh began claiming the gift of prophecy. David Thibodeau, in his 1999 book, A Place Called Waco, speculated that he had a sexual relationship with Lois Roden, the widow of Benjamin Roden and leader of the cult, who was then in her late 60s. Koresh eventually began to claim that God had chosen him to father a child with Lois, who would be the Chosen One. In 1983, Lois allowed Koresh to begin teaching his own message, called \\"The Serpent's Root\\", which caused controversy in the group. Lois's son George Roden intended to be the group's next leader and considered Koresh an interloper. When Koresh announced that God had instructed him to marry Rachel Jones (who then added Koresh to her name), a period of calm ensued at the Mount Carmel Center, but it proved only temporary. In the ensuing power struggle, George Roden claimed to have the support of the majority of the cult, forcing Koresh and his group off the property at gunpoint. Koresh and around 25 followers set up camp at Palestine, Texas, from Waco, where they lived under rough conditions in buses and tents for the next two years. During this time, Koresh undertook recruitment of new followers in California, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Australia. That same year, he traveled to Israel, where he claimed he had a vision that he was the modern-day Cyrus. The founder of the Davidian movement, Victor Houteff, wanted to be God's implement and establish the Davidic kingdom in Palestine. Koresh also wanted to be God's tool and set up the Davidic kingdom in Jerusalem. At least until 1990, he believed the place of his martyrdom might be in Israel, but by 1991, he was convinced that his martyrdom would be in the U.S. Instead of Israel, he said the prophecies of Daniel would be fulfilled in Waco and that the Mount Carmel Center was the Davidic kingdom. After being exiled to the Palestine camp, Koresh and his followers eked out a primitive existence. When Lois died in 1986, the exiled Branch Davidians wondered if they would ever be able to return to the Mount Carmel Center, but despite the displacement, \\"Koresh now enjoyed the loyalty of the majority of the [Branch Davidian] community\\".David G. Bromley and Edward D. Silver, \\"The Davidian Tradition: From Patronal Clan to Prophetic Movement,\\" p.54 in Stuart A. Wright, Armageddon in Waco: Critical Perspectives on the Branch Davidian Conflict (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1995) By late 1987, Roden's support was in steep decline. To regain it, he challenged Koresh to a contest to raise the dead, going so far as to exhume a corpse to demonstrate his spiritual supremacy. Koresh went to authorities to file charges against Roden for illegally exhuming a corpse, but was told he would have to show proof (such as a photograph of the corpse). Koresh seized the opportunity to seek criminal prosecution of Roden by returning to the Mount Carmel Center with seven armed followers, allegedly attempting to get photographic proof of the exhumation. Koresh's group was discovered by Roden, and a gunfight broke out. When the sheriff arrived, Roden had already suffered a minor gunshot wound and was pinned down behind a tree. As a result of the incident, Koresh and his followers were charged with attempted murder. At the trial, Koresh explained that he went to the Mount Carmel Center to uncover evidence of criminal disturbance of a corpse by Roden. Koresh's followers were acquitted, and in Koresh's case, a mistrial was declared. In 1989, Roden murdered Wayman Dale Adair with an axe blow to the skull after Adair stated his belief that he (Adair) was the true messiah.Marc Breault and Martin King, Inside the Cult, Signet, 1st Printing June 1993. . (Australian edition entitled Preacher of Death). Roden was judged insane and confined to a psychiatric hospital at Big Spring, Texas. Since Roden owed thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes on the Mount Carmel Center, Koresh and his followers were able to raise the money and reclaim the property. Roden continued to harass the Koresh faction by filing legal papers while imprisoned. When Koresh and his followers reclaimed the Mount Carmel Center, they discovered that tenants who had rented from Roden had left behind a meth lab, which Koresh reported to the local police department and asked to have removed.Thomas R. Lujan, \\"Legal Aspects of Domestic Employment of the Army\\", Parameters US Army War College Quarterly, Autumn 1997, Vol. XXVII, No. 3. Name change Vernon Howell filed a petition in California State Superior Court in Pomona on May 15, 1990, to legally change his name \\"for publicity and business purposes\\" to David Koresh. On August 28, 1990, Judge Robert Martinez granted the petition.Clifford L. Linedecker, Massacre at Waco, Texas, St. Martin's Press, 1993, page 94. . Koresh is the Biblical name of Cyrus the Great (⁄©Ÿàÿ±Ÿàÿ¥, Kurosh), a Persian king who is named a messiah for freeing Jews during the Babylonian captivity. His first name, David, symbolized a lineage directly to the biblical King David, from whom the new messiah would descend. By taking the name of David Koresh, he was \\"professing himself to be the spiritual descendant of King David, a messianic figure carrying out a divinely commissioned errand.\\"Bromley and Silver, p.57 Allegations of child abuse and statutory rape Koresh was alleged to have been involved in multiple incidents of physical and sexual abuse of children.See Christopher G. Ellison and John Bartkowski, \\"'Babies Were Being Beaten': Exploring Child Abuse Allegations at Ranch Apocalypse,\\" pp.111‚Äì152 in Stuart A. Wright (ed.), Armageddon in Waco: Critical Perspectives on the Branch Davidian Conflict (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1995) His doctrine of the House of DavidSee Bromley and Silver, pp.60‚Äì65 did lead to \\"marriages\\" with both married and single women in the Branch Davidians. This doctrine was based on a purported revelation that involved the procreation of 24 children by chosen women in the community. These 24 children were to serve as the ruling elders over the millennium after the return of Christ. These women purportedly chosen through this doctrine included at least one underaged girl, Michelle Jones, who was the younger sister of Koresh's legal wife Rachel and the daughter of lifelong Branch Davidians Perry and Mary Belle Jones. A six-month investigation of sexual abuse allegations by the Texas Child Protection Services in 1992 failed to turn up any evidence, possibly because the Branch Davidians concealed the spiritual marriage of Koresh to Michelle, assigning a surrogate husband (David Thibodeau) to the girl for the sake of appearances.David Thibodeau and Leon Whiteson, A Place Called Waco: A Survivor's Story (New York: Public Affairs, 1999) Regarding the allegations of physical abuse, the evidence is less certain. In one widely reported incident, ex-members claimed that Koresh became irritated with the cries of his son Cyrus and spanked the child severely for several minutes on three consecutive visits to the child's bedroom. In a second report, a man involved in a custody battle visited the Mount Carmel Center and claimed to have seen the beating of a young boy with a stick.Ellison and Bartkowski, 120‚Äì121. Finally, the FBI's justification for forcing an end to the 51-day standoff was predicated on the charge that Koresh was abusing children inside the Mount Carmel Center. Allegations had been made that he had fathered children with underaged girls in the Branch Davidians. In the hours that followed the deadly conflagration, Attorney General Janet Reno told reporters, \\"We had specific information that babies were being beaten.\\"Sam Howe Verovek, \\"In Shadow of Texas Siege, Uncertainty for Innocents.\\" New York Times, 1993, March 8 However, FBI Director William Sessions publicly denied the charge and told reporters that they had no such information about child abuse inside the Mount Carmel Center.Stephen Labaton, \\"Confusion Abounds in the Capital on Rationale for Assault on Cult,\\" New York Times, 1993, April 21 A careful examination of the other child abuse charges found the evidence to be weak and ambiguous, casting doubt on the allegations.Ellison and Bartkowski, 1995 The allegations of child abuse largely stem from detractors and ex-members.John R. Hall, \\"Public Narratives and the Apocalyptic Sect,\\" pp.205‚Äì235 in Stuart A. Wright (ed.), Armageddon in Waco (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1995); Stuart A. Wright, \\"Construction and Escalation of a 'Cult' Threat: Dissecting Moral Panic and Official Reaction to the Branch Davidians,\\" pp.75‚Äì94 in Stuart A. Wright (ed.), Armageddon in Waco The 1993 Justice Department report cites allegations of child sexual and physical abuse. Legal scholars point out that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) had no legal jurisdiction in the matter of child protection and these accounts appear to have been inserted by the ATF to inflame the case against Koresh. For example, the account of former Branch Davidian Jeannine Bunds is reproduced in an ATF affidavit. She claimed that Koresh had fathered at least 15 children with various women and girls, and that she had personally delivered seven of these infants. Bunds also claims that Koresh would annul all marriages of couples who joined the group and had exclusive sexual access to the women and girls.Ellison and Bartkowski, 1995; Wright, \\"Construction and Escalation of a 'Cult' Threat,\\" 1995 In his book, James Tabor states that on a videotape that was sent out of the compound during the siege, Koresh acknowledged that he had fathered more than 12 children by several \\"wives\\". On March 3, 1993, during negotiations to secure the release of the remaining children, Koresh advised hostage negotiators that: \\"My children are different than those others,‚Äù referring to his direct lineage versus those children whom he had previously released. Raid and siege by federal authorities FBI photo of the Mount Carmel Center engulfed in flames on April 19, 1993 The Waco siege began on February 28, 1993, when the ATF raided Mount Carmel Center. The ensuing gun battle resulted in the deaths of four ATF agents and six Branch Davidians. Shortly after the initial raid, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team took command of the federal operation, because the FBI has jurisdiction over incidents involving the deaths of federal agents. The negotiating team established contact with Koresh inside the compound. Communication over the next 51 days included telephone exchanges with various FBI negotiators. Koresh himself had been seriously injured by a gunshot. As the standoff continued, his closest male associates and he negotiated delays, so that he could possibly write religious documents, which he said he needed to complete before his surrender. Koresh's conversations with the negotiators were dense and they also included biblical imagery. The FBI negotiators treated the situation as a hostage crisis. The siege of the Mount Carmel Center ended on April 19, 1993, when U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno approved recommendations of FBI officials to proceed with a final advance in which the Branch Davidians would be removed from the Mount Carmel Center by force. In an attempt to flush Koresh out of the stronghold, the FBI resorted to pumping CS gas into the compound with the aid of an M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle, which was equipped with a battering ram. In the course of the advance, the Mount Carmel Center caught fire under circumstances that are still disputed today. Barricaded inside the building, 79 Branch Davidians perished in the ensuing blaze; 21 of these victims were children under the age of 16. According to the FBI, Steve Schneider, Koresh's right-hand man, who \\"probably realized that he was dealing with a fraud,\\" shot and killed Koresh and then committed suicide with the same gun. A second account gave a totally different story: Koresh, then 33, died of a gunshot wound to the head during the course of the fire. No one knows who killed him or if he killed himself. The medical examiner reported 20 people, including five children under the age of 14, had been shot, and a three-year-old had been stabbed in the chest. Aftermath Taylor Kitsch plays Koresh in the miniseries Waco. Koresh is buried at Memorial Park Cemetery, Tyler, Texas in the \\"Last Supper\\" section. Several of his albums were released, including Voice of Fire, in 1994. In 2004, Koresh's 1968 Chevrolet Camaro, which had been damaged during the raid, sold for $37,000 at auction. It is now owned by Ghost Adventures host Zak Bagans. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols cited the Waco siege as their motivation for the Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, which was timed to coincide with the second anniversary of the Waco assault. Four documentary films have been made about the siege, including different versions of Waco: The Rules of Engagement, Waco: A New Revelation, Waco: The Big Lie, and Waco: Madman or Messiah. In 2018, BBC Radio 5 live created a radio podcast titled End of Days, which was about the death and life of Koresh, his involvement in the Waco siege, and the recruitment of people who lived in Nottingham, Manchester, and London into the Branch Davidians. The Court TV (now TruTV) television series Mugshots released an episode about Koresh. Koresh is portrayed by Taylor Kitsch in the 2018 miniseries Waco. He was also one of the sources of inspiration used to create the fictional cult leader Joseph Seed in the 2018 action-adventure video game Far Cry 5.

They are indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain from urethral spasm, and for extending the interval(s) between injections of opiates. The drug has various \\"off label\\" uses, including renal colic, intestinal cramps, tenesmus and diarrhea. They are also often prescribed after urinary bladder surgery. B&O; Supprettes was unique in the United States because they were the only drug containing opium that is for suppository use sold in the US and, in fact, one of the very few medications that contains opium in any form in the US along with paregoric and opium tincture (laudanum).In November 2009, manufacturers of Paregoric (Camphorated Tincture of Opium) and Laudanum (Tincture of Opium) were notified in writing that there were was no FDA approval on-file for either preparation, and as-such, their manufacture and distribution may be in violation of federal (USA) laws. History B&O; Supprettes (the name is derived from the generic term 'belladonna/opium suppository') is an \\"unapproved\\" drug according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ‚Äì that is, the drug existed before the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938. Accordingly, the compound has never undergone specific medical trials, and its efficacy has never been required to be demonstrated. The FDA has put pressure on the manufacturers of this drug for this reason. The original manufacturer of the Supprettes, Eli Lilly and Company, has long since lost any patent to the drug. Amerifit, which manufactured generic Supprettes prior to 2008, was cautioned by the FDA due to the unapproved nature of the drug combination. Since 2008, Paddock Laboratories has manufactured a generic version of the Supprettes after working with the FDA on marketing issues related to the unapproved nature of the drug. Dosage and administration The drug and its generic counterparts are supplied in packages of 12, and available in two strengths: Each B&O; Supprettes suppository #15 A contains 16.2 mg (1/4 grain) of belladonna and 30 mg (1/2 grain) of opium. Each B&O; Supprettes suppository #16 A contains 16.2 mg of belladonna and 60 mg (1 grain) of opium. The usual dose is one suppository rectally once or twice daily PRN - (as needed), not to exceed four Supprettes in a 24-hour period. In the United States, B&O; Supprettes is a Schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970; a written prescription is mandatory, and no refills are permitted. Refrigerated storage is preferable, but not required. Most pharmacies consider B&O; Supprettes to be a \\"special order\\" item, and as such are not normally kept in inventory. Compounding pharmacies have the capability of producing a generic form of the medication, and can modify the dosage(s) of the active ingredients (for pediatric or elderly patients, and those with chronic kidney disease) or the carrier (usually substituting cocoa butter) to best meet the needs of the patient at the request of the prescriber.

Life Tollius was born in Rhenen, the son of Johannes Tollius and his first wife Maria Gordon. He probably studied in Utrecht and certainly in Amsterdam under the friendly guidance of Gerhard Johann Vossius. With Gerhard's son Isaac Vossius, who in 1648 became court librarian in Uppsala, he went to Sweden as an amanuensis. His companion later accused him of having stolen some of his books. On 12 April 1648 Tollius was appointed professor of history and Greek at the University of Harderwijk, where he was also secretary of the College of Curators. In January 1654 he succeeded Georgius Hornius as professor of history, political science, and geography. Tollius died unexpectedly in Gouda, shortly after his marriage on 5 March to Margaretha van Kent, the daughter of the mayor of Gouda. He died in Gouda, still a young man, while his contemporaries had high expectations of him. Works Tollius' publications include: *Cornelii Tollii Ad Pierii Valeriani De literatorum infelicitate librum appendix (Amsterdam 1647) online (Harderwijk 1655 and Leipzig 1707, with Pietro Alcionio, Medices legatus sive de exilio Oratio de natura et constitutione verae Politices) *Pal√¶phati De Incredibilibvs, Greek text with Latin translation (Amsterdam 1649) online (translation reprinted by Martin Brunner, Uppsala 1663; by Thomas Gale, Opuscula Mythologica Ethica et Physica, Cambridge 1671, repr.

Analysis by Carbon 14 dating revealed the woman had lived during the Iron Age, around 160 BCE to 340 CE. The mummified remains are exhibited at the National Museum of Denmark. The elaborate clothing worn by Huldremose Woman has been reconstructed and displayed at several museums. Discovery On 15 May 1879, the body was discovered by Niels Hanson, who was a school teacher in Ramten, Denmark, after digging a meter through the peat. Hanson then reported the find to a fellow teacher, who notified police as well as a pharmacist, who moved the body to a nearby barn for examination. The corpse was later surrendered to the national museum of Copenhagen. Bioarchaeology The body was found with the legs bent behind the back, with a nearly severed right arm. It is thought that the arm was damaged by a shovel during excavation. Apart from this, the corpse was well intact. Before the woman died, she had broken one of her legs, although it had healed before she died. She wore a plaid cape, a scarf, and skirt, all made of wool. A comb and headband were found as well. Lacerations on one of the feet were thought to be post-mortem injuries inflicted by a shovel until they were then evaluated to have happened near the time of death. A rope was also found around the neck of the body, which suggests that she was hanged or strangled, although it may have been a necklace. The body was reexamined non-invasively in 1990 and a dietary analysis was conducted in 1999. Radiography showed hair stubble on the scalp as well as the remains of the brain inside the cranium. The bones were demineralized, like many other bog bodies. The dietary analysis consisted of two samples of the gut contents, revealing that the woman's final meal had been rye bread.

Discovery Hairstyle of Elling Woman A reconstruction of her hairstyle and cape Later known as the Elling Woman, the body was discovered by a local farmer, Jens Zakariasson, who at first believed that the remains were of a drowned animal. The body was wrapped in a sheepskin cape with a leather cloak tied around her legs. The face of the woman was poorly preserved, and there were no traces of organs inside of the body. Examination The Elling Woman is believed to have been hanged, like the Tollund Man. The estimated year of death was dated to approximately 280 BCE in the Nordic Iron Age, also around the time of the Tollund Man; however, it is not possible to confirm whether or not both she and he were killed at exactly the same time. It also initially might have been impossible to tell the sex of her body, if the hair had not been preserved, although X rays were taken of her pelvis, which proved she was female. In 1978, the body was reexamined with radiographs, from which the sex was inferred to be female and the original age-at-death estimate of 25 years was found to be accurate. This body is often identified by its braid, which was tied into an elaborate knot. Elling Woman is believed to have been a human sacrifice. Demineralization, which often occurs with bog bodies, was found to be the initial cause of what was first understood as apparent osteoporosis in the remains.

He is best known for helping to establish the career of Jackie Chan, serving as his manager and later as the actor‚Äôs producing partner in both Asia and North America. He also managed the career of singer-rapper and actor Edison Chen. Career Chan graduated from the East-West Center in Hawaii in 1966 with a master's degree in marketing. He later moved to Hong Kong from his native Malaysia in 1970 to pursue a career in the film industry. He was a talent scout and line producer in the mid-1970s when he met Jackie Chan, who was, at the time, a stuntman. Willie helped him to gain the leading role in Lo Wei's New Fist of Fury, which was released during the \\"Bruceploitation\\" era, but was not a movie of that kind, and was hailed as a \\"follow-up\\" to Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury. Willie had shown a keen interest in Jackie's willingness and ability to perform dangerous stunts. This happened after Jackie, fed up with a staggering career, moved to Australia for a few months to work as a painter for a construction company. Willie brought him back to work as a leading actor on the above-mentioned sequel for Lo's production company, \\"Lo Wei Motion Picture Company\\", a subsidiary of Golden Harvest. The films, which included Snake & Crane Arts of Shaolin, were not financially successful. Jackie was then loaned to a different producer Ng See- yuen, who launched his career with Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master. Willie then left the company to join Golden Harvest, with Willie serving as Chan's personal manager. After Raymond Chow established Jackie's career with The Young Master, Jackie went to the United States, attempting to make a career move in the American film market, while studying English at the Berlitz Language School with Willie Chan. After Jackie‚Äôs unsuccessful career in the United States, Willie returned to Hong Kong with an interest in artist management. In 1985, he formed The JC Group, and at its peak of success, the company had 43 actors on its books. In the 1990s, the triads began to gain a strong influence in the Hong Kong film industry, forcing Willie to join marches against gangsterism in the industry. =Later years= In later years, Willie Chan served as a producing partner for Jackie Chan's JCE Movies Limited. He worked alongside Jackie in his career in both Asia and North America. In 2006, he stepped away from being Jackie's manager, letting Jackie's wife, Joan Lin, take over. Willie was honored at the 30th Hong Kong Film Awards for professional achievement by Jackie and some of the clients Willie managed. Chan died in his sleep in Hong Kong at age 76. Chan was ultimately cremated, and his funeral was held on November 23, with film industry people like Jackie Chan, Raymond Chow, and Jacky Cheung being his pallbearers.

Mangal is former captain of the Afghanistan national cricket team. In January 2017 he retired from international cricket and became the national chief selector for Afghanistan. Early career Born in Kabul, Afghanistan, Mangal spent much of his early years in refugee camps in neighbouring Pakistan with his family, fleeing from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent Civil War that followed the Soviet withdrawal. It was in the camps that Mangal, like many of his teammates, was introduced to cricket. The War in Afghanistan saw the US Army put an end to Taliban rule of Afghanistan in 2001 and soon after Mangal returned to the country. In the aftermath, the Afghanistan national cricket team was founded. Mangal was spotted by then Afghanistan coach Taj Malik. Mangal's father tried to stop him playing, citing the sport as not being a living. Malik went to the province of Khost on the Pakistani border to speak to with Mangal's family, telling him: \\"He will be great\\". Malik stayed the night pleading with him, and by the morning, convinced him to allow Mangal to play.Times report on the Afghan cricket team Mangal made his debut for Afghanistan against Nowshehra in the 2001 Quaid-e- Azam Trophy (Grade II).Nowshehra v Afghanistan (2001) He made his international debut for Afghanistan against Oman in the 2004 ACC Trophy.

History  The school is named after Thomas Carlyle Thompson, who donated the land and most of the funds to build the original high school building which is now the intermediate center. Thompson High School's first official school day was October 3, 1921. The former site of Thompson High School was not established until the 1980s. It was part of the Shelby County School District, but as of July 1, 2013 has pulled out and joined the Alabaster City School System. The school mascot is the Warriors. The school colors are red, white, and black. Thompson has approximately 2,000 students. It participates in 7A level sports in Alabama. The school's wrestling team, established in 2007, won five state titles in a row (four 6A & one 7A) from 2011 to 2016. The wrestling team won its sixth state title in 2018 (7A). The Thompson High School Football team went 12‚Äì1 during the 2017 season; defeating Hoover High School to win the 7A Region 3 championship. The Warriors fell in the semi-finals against Hoover High School that year. The following year in 2018, Thompson's football team advanced to the AHSAA 7A Finals for the first time in over three decades. In 2019, the Warriors went 12-1 and advanced to the AHSAA 7A Finals were they beat the Central-Phenix City Red Devils 40‚Äì14, giving Thompson their first football state championship since 1983. Senior quarterback Sawyer Pate took home the game's MVP, and went 14‚Äì22 with 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also rushed for 7 yards and another touchdown.

It often serves as a repository of information and a means of discussion for the internet subculture known as Anonymous.. This NSFW Internet site celebrates a subversive \\"trolling culture\\", and documents Internet memes, culture, and events, such as mass organized pranks, trolling events, \\"raids\\", large-scale failures of Internet security, and criticism of Internet communities which are accused of self-censorship in order to garner prestige or positive coverage from traditional and established media outlets. The site has been described as hosting numerous pornographic images, and content that is \\"misogynistic, racist, and homophobic\\". Journalist Julian Dibbell described Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica as the site \\"where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in-jokes, catchphrases, and obsessions is lovingly annotated, and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture: Flamingly racist, homophobic and misogynistic content lurks throughout, all of it calculated to offend.\\". The site is known for its pervasive clickbait advertisements, in addition to having almost no rules. Ninemsn described Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica as: > Wikipedia's evil twin. It's a site where almost every article is biased, > offensive, unsourced, and without the faintest trace of political > correctness. A search through its archives will reveal animated images of > people committing suicide, articles glorifying extreme racism and sexism, > and a seemingly endless supply of twisted, shocking views on just about > every major human tragedy in history. On April 14, 2011, the original URL of the site was redirected to a new website named \\"Oh Internet\\" that bore little resemblance to Encyclopedia Dramatica. Parts of the ED community harshly criticized the changes. On the night of the Encyclopedia Dramatica shutdown, regular ED visitors bombarded the 'Oh Internet' Facebook wall with hate messages. The Web Ecology Project made a downloadable archive of former Encyclopedia Dramatica content. Fan-made torrents and several mirrors of the original site were subsequently generated, before the wiki located at encyclopediadramatica.rs (formerly encyclopediadramatica.ch, encyclopediadramatica.es, and encyclopediadramatica.se) emerged as the only one still active. The site is online under the .wiki Top-level domain name .  History = The original = Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by Sherrod DeGrippo, also known by the online pseudonym \\"Girlvinyl\\". DeGrippo joined LiveJournal in 2000 and became enthralled by the behavior of some of its members: > People were accessible and it was bidirectional. Voyeurs and exhibitionists > were able to interact in a way that was normalized. That‚Äôs why I started ED. > It was mostly just personalities that were just so nuts and fascinating. She became involved in the LJdrama community, which covered stories on LiveJournal gossip. When the community was banned from LiveJournal, they created their own website. In 2002, two LiveJournal users, Joshua Williams (aka mediacrat) and Andrewpants, became intimately involved with each other. After they broke off their relationship, LJdrama decided to document the resulting drama. Unflattering photographs of Williams were spread on the web, and Williams considered this to be harassment. He threatened legal action, traveled to Portland, Oregon, in order to speak to LiveJournal's abuse team, and reported the alleged harassment to a local TV news station. DeGrippo created Encyclopedia Dramatica in order to \\"house some information from livejournal and some drama about hackers Theo DeRaadt and Darren Reed.\\" Encyclopedia Dramatica characterized itself as being \\"In the spirit of Ambrose Bierce's The Devil's Dictionary.\\" The New York Times Magazine recognized the wiki as \\"an online compendium of troll humor and troll lore\\" that it labeled a \\"troll archive\\". C't, a European magazine for IT professionals, noted the site's role in introducing newcomers to the culture of 4chan's /b/, a notorious Internet imageboard. Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica defines trolling in terms of doing things \\"for the lulz\\" (for laughs), a phrase that it qualifies as \\"a catchall explanation for any trolling you do.\\". The targets of this trolling come from \\"every pocket of the Web\\",. to include not only the non- corporeal aspects of Internet phenomena, (e.g. online catchphrases, fan pages, forums, and viral phenomena), but also real people (e.g. amateur celebrities, identifiable internet drama participants and even Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica's own forum members). These are derided in a manner described variously as \\"coarse\\", \\"offensive\\", \\"obscene\\",. \\"irreverent, obtuse, politically incorrect\\", \\"crude but hilarious\\", and \\"crude and abusive\\".. The material is presented to appear comprehensive, with extensive use of shock-value prose, drawings, photographs, and the like. The emotional responses are then added to the articles, often in similarly derogatory or inflammatory manner, with the purpose of provoking further emotional response. Adherents of the practice assert that visitors to the website \\"shouldn't take anything said on Dramatica seriously.\\" Articles at Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica are particularly critical of MySpace. as well as users on YouTube, LiveJournal, DeviantART, Tumblr, and Wikipedia. In The New York Times Magazine, journalist Jonathan Dee described it as a \\"snarky Wikipedia anti-fansite\\".. Shaun Davies of Australia's Nine Network called it \\"Wikipedia's bastard child, a compendium of internet trends and culture which lampoons every subject it touches.\\". The site \\"is run like Wikipedia, but its style is the opposite; most of its information is biased and opinionated, not to mention racist, homophobic, and spiteful, but on the upside its snide attitude makes it spot-on about most Internet memes it covers.\\". This coverage of Internet jargon and memes had been acknowledged in the New Statesman,. on Language Log,. in C't magazine, online copy . and in Wired magazine. According to Sherrod DeGrippo, > As long as something wasn‚Äôt submitted as illegal or an abuse complaint, I > didn‚Äôt even see it. Wikis are something that you either closely, closely > monitor and manage, or you just let it go. On December 8, 2010, Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica deleted its article on Operation Payback. On the same day, Facebook deleted its Operation Payback page, and Twitter suspended Operation Payback's account. An anonymous source told Gawker that the Encyclopedia Dramatica article was deleted as the result of court orders. = Oh Internet = Oh Internet main page DeGrippo reportedly \\"came to hate\\" Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica. She had hoped that ED would return to its roots and focus on LiveJournal drama. On April 14, 2011, the URL encyclopediadramatica.com was redirected to \\"Oh Internet\\", an entirely different safe-for-work website that DeGrippo had created. The name \\"Oh Internet\\" is meant to convey \\"Oh, Internet, you are so crazy!\\" DeGrippo stated that \\"Shock for shock's sake is old at this point [...] .\\" Some regular users of Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica were displeased by the change and attacked the website's official Facebook fan page with \\"hate messages and pornography\\". In a question and answer session at the ROFLCon summit in October 2011, DeGrippo was asked why Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica was closed and replaced with Oh Internet. She replied: \\"We were unable to stop the degradation of the content. It just kept getting longer and longer and dumber and dumber and less and less coherent over time.\\" She also explained why she had not released the site as an archive, saying that she \\"didn't want to\\", and suggesting that this would have made her personally responsible for any DMCA and privacy violations that it contained. She also stated that hosting Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica caused her to have troubles involving the FBI. = Succession of domains = Ryan Cleary hosted a fork of Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica at encyclopediadramatica.ch. Members of this project gathered text and images from Google's web cache and other backups, and a script was created to upload cached information. On June 21, 2011, Scotland Yard arrested Ryan Cleary based on alleged connections to online attacks on Sony. The arrest temporarily disrupted operation of the wiki, but other members were able to resume Cleary's duties. Garrett E. Moore later became the fork's owner. Moore reported difficulties in securing a host for the website. On March 19, 2012, encyclopediadramatica.ch was shut down for a short time due to a \\"DNS block\\". On March 21, 2012, the site moved to a Swedish domain name, at encyclopediadramatica.se, instead of a domain in Switzerland as before. The site's Facebook account later addressed the block, stating that it was because \\"we didn't keep up our end of the nic.ch user agreement contract stating that we had to keep a mailing address and phone number in Switzerland.\\" In September 2013, the site changed its domain to a Spanish domain name at encyclopediadramatica.es. In October 2014, the site returned to the .se domain. In January 2018, the site changed its domain to a Serbian domain name at encyclopediadramatica.rs. In October 2019, the official Twitter page announced that the site returned to the .se domain. In February 2020, it was announced that the site changed its domain to the .wiki domain. Garrett E. Moore, the operator of a fork of Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica located at encyclopediadramatica.se (encyclopediadramatica.ch at the time), told an interviewer for The Daily Dot: > People take themselves too seriously, they can't laugh at anything. We make > fun of everything. I make fun of skinny white computer nerds, but I am one. When asked about \\"abusive content\\", Moore stated that he removes it when he sees it, then further explained: > I'm not going to leave a 14-year-old girl's address up on a page cause some > dipshit got mad at her and made an article. But if you dress up like a fox > and wear diapers and then take pictures of it? That's fair game, sir. In a later interview with The Daily Dot, Moore defended his community's belief in free speech. In January 2013, a video game created by user \\"gizmo01942\\" came to the attention of the media. The game, Bullet to the Head of the NRA, was controversial because the player could take aim and shoot at members of the National Rifle Association. In February 2015, Muhammad Sex Simulator 2015, another video game by the same user, attracted further controversy because of the recent Charlie Hebdo shooting.  Reception  The website received mainstream media attention after Jason Fortuny used Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica to post photographs, e-mails and phone numbers from 176 responses to a Craigslist advertisement he posted in 2006, in which he posed as a woman seeking sexual encounters with dominant men.. The incident was addressed in a blog hosted at Wired News, where the blogger proposes that Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica may be the \\"world's lamest wiki\\". In 2006, \\"a well-known band of trolls\\" emailed Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica's creator, DeGrippo, demanding edits to the protected (i.e. locked) article describing them. After she refused to do so, the trolls ordered taxis, pizzas, escort services and sent death threats and threats of rape to DeGrippo's apartment. Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica became a \\"favourite target for critics, who accuse Anonymous of propagating hate,\\" for allowing alleged members of the group to sometimes use the website as a platform. Through this association, Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica received incidental coverage when actions by members of Anonymous led to the arrest of an alleged pedophile,. when they demonstrated against Scientology in London;.. when a member of the group broke into the e-mail account of former Republican vice- presidential nominee Sarah Palin,. and when a member of Anonymous claimed credit for an attack on the virtual Second Life headquarters of former presidential candidate John Edwards.. The convergence of Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica with the anti-Scientology campaign of Project Chanology was noted by technology journalist Julian Dibbell.. On December 16, 2008, Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica won the People's Choice Winners category for favorite wiki in Mashable's 2nd Annual Open Web Awards, with wikiHow as the runner-up and Wikipedia coming in 3rd.. In December 2008, a message on Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica asked for donations and claimed that the website was under attack and had lost its advertisers. In January 2010, the Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica article Aboriginal was removed from the search engine results of Google Australia, after a lawyer filed a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission saying its content was racist.. A search on terms related to the article produced a message that one of the results has been removed after a legal request relating to Australia's Racial Discrimination Act (RDA)... The publicity surrounding this served to raise the profile of the site. In March 2010, it was reported that the Australian Human Rights Commission had notified the site by e-mail that according to Australian law, the article Aboriginal could be in breach of Sections 18C and 18D of its RDA.  Lawsuits  In 2016, a United Kingdom court determined an ED user must pay ¬£10,000 in libel damages for making false statements about Samuel Collingwood Smith, a former Labour councillor. In 2017, a suit was launched against the website seeking US$750,000 for alleged copyright infringement. The \\"life-threatening\\" suit is by millionaire Jonathan Monsarrat. Monsarrat's suit was dismissed in December 2017, with the judge ruling that the three year statute of limitations for copyright infringement had expired before the lawsuit was filed.

It served as a seat of power in the Mamluk and Ottoman periods and as a police station under the British Mandate. History=Mamluk period= The first floor of Qasr al- Basha was built by the Mamluk sultan Zahir Baibars in the mid-13th century. The facade bares the landmark of Baibars which is a relief sculpture of two lions facing each other. The geometrical patterns and domes, fan and cross vaults are typical Mamluk architecture under Bahri rule. According to local legend, in the 13th century CE, when Baibars was still a general fighting the Crusaders and Mongols throughout the Levant, he passed through Gaza on several occasions. During one of his visits, Baibars is believed to have married in Gaza and built a grand mansion for his Gazan wife and children. It is said that Qasr al-Basha is what remains of this home.Qasr Al-Basha - Gaza This Week in Palestine. October 2006. =Ottoman period= The second floor of the building is largely of Ottoman-era construction. In the 17th century, Qasr al- Basha served as the fortress home of the ruling Radwan dynasty (hence the name \\"Radwan Castle\\") and later pashas of Gaza, who were governors appointed by the Ottoman governor of the Damascus Province. During this era, the fortress was provided with arrow slits and underground passages as means of defense. Within the complex were soldier's lodgings, a mosque, granary, an armory, and cannons. The height of the structure made Qasr al-Basha a strategic point in Gaza. This, along with its fortifications, was the probable reason Napoleon Bonaparte spent three nights at the palace during his campaign that ended at Acre in 1799, hence the name \\"Napoleon's Fort\\". Turkish traveller Evliya √áelebi wrote of Qasr al-Basha in 1649, saying \\"the Citadel was built in ancient times and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. The present citadel derives from a later time. It is small and rectangular and lies one hour distant, east of the sea. Its walls are twenty yards high. It has a metal door which opens in the direction of the qibla. The commander and the garrison must always be present here to fulfill their guard duties because it is in a dangerous place, here the Arab tribes and the enemy are numerous.\\" =Modern period= During the British Mandate of Palestine period it was used as a police station, and during the Egyptian rule of Gaza, Qasr al-Basha was turned into a school known as the Princess Ferial School for Girls. After Farouk I of Egypt were deposed in Cairo, the school was renamed to al-Zahra Secondary School for Girls. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) undertook a project, funded by a grant from the German Development Bank (KfW), for the transformation of Qasr al-Basha into a museum. The UNDP built new facilities for the girls school, and restoration of the Pasha's Palace began under the close supervision of the Palestinian Authority Department of Antiquities and Cultural Heritage. During the first phase of the project, workers landscaped the museum grounds, installed new doors, windows and gates, and restored the facade of the palace. The Pasha's Palace Museum (Gaza) .

The project, started in 1994, was originally known as Prevention and Management of Marine Pollution in the East Asian Seas (SDS- SEA). PEMSEA is currently being hosted by the Philippines' Department of Environment and Natural Resources and holds its office in the DENR compound in Quezon City, Philippines. History In December 1993, several Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) pilot sites were established, including Xiamen (PR China) and Batangas Bay (Philippines), which helped start efforts in addressing marine pollution problems in the Straits of Malacca and Straits of Singapore; and increasing capacity development in the regions of Cambolia, China, DPR Korea, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. A second phase of the Project, implemented between 1999 and 2007, was supported by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), focused on building partnerships between stakeholders. The project was renamed to PEMSEA to reflect the new thrust of the programme. In 2003, participating governments and stakeholders of the organization issued Sustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia (SDS-SEA) to promote a common vision in the area of sustainable development in the region. In 2007, PEMSEA committed itself to implementing the SDS-SEA as a part of Phase I project (2007-2017). The latest phase's aim is to make PEMSEA a self-sustaining regional operating mechanism. PEMSEA's areas of work include coastal and ocean governance, natural and man-made hazard prevention and management, habitat protection, restoration and management, water use and supply management, pollution and waste reduction management, as well as food security and livelihood management. One of the important tasks that PEMSEA assumes is turning the knowledge about regional coastal into action that can improve the status quo. PEMSEA capitalizes on its broad intergovernmental, financial and intellectual resources to come up with the best solutions problems of sustainable coastal management. East Asian Seas Congress Every three years, PEMSEA hosts the East Asian Seas Congress that consists of a Ministerial Forum, an International Conference and other events. The conference focuses on tracking progress of SDS-SEA, encourages knowledge exchange and raises important issues regarding coastal management in the region. It also tries to engage private sector in helping develop sustainable financial and business solutions to coastal management problems. The first East Asian Seas Congress was held in December 2003 in Putrajaya, Malaysia. It was organized following the recommendations of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) with the goal to improve situation related to coasts and oceans. The following two congresses were held in Haikou City, Hainan Province, PR China in the year 2006 and in Philippines in the year 2009. The 2012 congress was held with the theme ‚ÄúBuilding a Blue Economy: Strategy, Opportunities, and Partnerships in the Seas of East Asia‚Äù in July 2012 in Changwon City, the Republic of Korea. National and regional agreements and declarations The programme was instrumental to the adoption of several national and regional agreements, including: * Putrajaya Declaration: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, PR China, DPR Korea, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, RO Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam adopted the Putrajaya Declaration of Regional Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Seas of East Asia on 12 December 2003. The declaration formally adopted the SDS-SEA as a regional strategy for the sustainable development of the seas of the region. * Haikou Partnership Agreement: Signed by the original signatories of the Putrajaya Declaration (with the exception of Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia) and Japan, the agreement established the coordinating and operating mechanisms of the implementation of the SDS-SEA. * Manila Bay Declaration: Signed in 2001, the declaration is a commitment between the national government and concerned local government units in the Philippines for the implementation of the Manila Bay Coastal Strategy, providing an environmental management framework for Manila Bay and its watersheds. * Bohai Sea Declaration: Governors of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong and Tianjin, together with the Administrator of China's State Oceanic Administration signed the Bohai Declaration on Environmental Protection, formally adopting principles, objectives, policy measures and actions to reduce waste and marine pollution across the administrative boundaries of the adjacent coastal municipalities and provinces. * Executive Order 533 (Philippines): EO533 declared Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) as the national strategy for sustainable development of the country's marine and coastal resources.

He was track cycling World Champion in 1894, and competed at the European Speed Skating Championships in 1896. Henie was coach and manager for his daughter Sonja, who became a famous figure skater and later film actress. Cycling Henie was an active track cyclist from 1889 to 1902. He represented the club Kristiania Velocipedklub. When he became World Champion in 1894, he was also the first Norwegian World Champion in any sport. =Early efforts= Henie started in his first race in June 1889, on the Majorstuen velodrome, and surprised by winning his class. In August 1889 he won the 2000 metre race on the Bygd√∏ velodrome. In 1890 he represented his club at races in Copenhagen, and achieved a third place in 1 English mile. =Scandinavian success= In 1891 Henie experienced a lot of triumphs in Scandinavian races. He won races in Malm√∏ and in Copenhagen, where he became Scandinavian Champion on 5000 metres. He also won 1st prizes at Majorstuen. He set Scandinavian records in halfmile, in one English mile, in 4000 metres, in 5000 metres and in 5 English miles. Henie was appointed consul for Svenskt Hjulsportf√∂rbund in 1892. The consular connections were important at the time, as Norway was not a member of the International Cycling Association, and enrollment to international races had to go through member countries. =International career= Henie participated in 100 km motor pace at the 1894 Track Cycling World Championships for amateurs in Antwerp, and became World Champion. He did not have a motor pace as his hardest competitors, but was helped by Dutch tandem cyclists at the end of the race. Henie won the championship 13 rounds ahead of Green from England. He set two World Records in 1894, in two English miles and in ten English miles, both at the Herne Hill Velodrome in London. In 1895 he finished 3rd at the World Championships in Cologne, behind Mathieu Cordang and Witteveen. In 1900 he finished second at the World Championships in Paris, behind Bastien, with Hildebrand finishing third. He continued active cycling until 1902. Speed skating Henie was also a speed skater. He competed at the 1896 European Speed Skating Championships in Hamburg, where he finished second on 500m, third in 1500m, third in 5000m, and third in 10000m. Coach and manager for Sonja Henie was married to Selma Lochmann-Nielsen (1888‚Äì1961). They had two children, Leif and Sonja. Sonja started taking ballet lessons from she was five years old, and got her own skates when she was six. The family lived close to Frogner Stadion in Kristiania, and Sonja found her way to the ice, where she liked to play and experiment with the skates. When Sonja was only six years old, she was discovered by Hj√∏rdis Olsen, a figure skater and coach for the skating club. When Henie learned to know that his daughter had extraordinary talent, he decided to give her the best possible training. He found professional coaches for her, and travelled to the best training sites in Europe. Among her early coaches were former Norwegian champion and professional coach Oscar Holthe, and Martin Stixrud (10 times national champion, and Olympic medalist in 1920). In addition to training sessions with professional coaches, Henie himself coached her daughter. In her book Mitt livs eventyr Sonja says she had \\"the world's best manager, promotor, coach, helper and father\\". Later he also and arranged for performances at sports meetings. Sonja performed during intermissions at the large skating competitions in Oslo in 1921, 1922 and 1923, which gave her experience in performing in front of a large public. Henie managed to get Sonja enrolled at the first Winter Olympics in Chamonix in 1924, and followed her to preparations in St. Moritz prior to the games. Sonja was then only eleven years old. Henie and his wife Selma also designed Sonja's skating costumes. Sonja became World Champion in figure skating first time in 1927, and from then on every year until 1936. She became Olympic Champion in 1928, and again in 1932 and in 1936. She was European champion in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1936, and several times national champion. During this period Henie devoted much of his time and energy on his daughter's career. After three Olympic gold medals and ten World Championships, Sonja gave up her amateur status and headed for a film career in Hollywood. The family travelled to America in 1936, when Sonja was 25 years old. Henie hired the skating stadion \\"The Polar Palace\\" in Los Angeles for an ice show, arranged for promotion in newspapers, and invited important persons from Hollywood. Sonja signed a lucrative five years' contract with film maker Darryl F. Zanuck, and her first film, One In A Million was finished late 1936. Parallel to the film career, Sonja also performed in popular ice revues. Henie died in 1937.

Since the beginning, Poster Boy has remained anonymous and refuse to sell or sign any original work. The collective's work focuses the principles of hip hop, specifically the element of graffiti, by limiting almost all work to improvisation. Using only a razor blade, Poster Boy creates satiric collage-like works created by cutting out sections of the self-adhesive advertisement posters in the platforms of New York City Subway stations, and pasting them back in different positions. Poster Boy is also referred to a 'Poster Boy movement' where other people produce similar unsigned work in the New York City subways imitating this original artist. Even after their first arrest, of Brooklyn resident Henry Matyjewicz, the collective remains active online and on the streets. One of Poster Boy's work is featured in Banksy's 2010 documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop. Poster Boy's work was also included in the retrospective street art show \\"10 Years of Wooster Collective\\" at Jonathan LeVine Gallery in 2013. Work \\"At first, it was just something to keep me occupied while waiting on the subway.\\" \\"I was playing with the posters, cutting them up\\" (he carried a razor used at work) and discovered that unlike the cardboard posters in the subway trains, the advertising posters on the subway platforms were printed on a self-adhesive material that could be stuck back down after being torn or cut out. He began to play with available images and text to create humorous \\"mash- ups\\" of advertisements. In 2008 alone, he has created over 200 manipulated underground posters in NYC subway. He compares the creation of poster \\"mash- ups\\" to hip hop \\"freestyling\\" on a microphone. He does not have preconceived notions of what the work will be (\\"I don't have anything planned‚Ä¶go there, see something, get inspired and do the work\\"), but uses the available images, often in a way that relates to current events. One commentator noted: \\"The pieces generally have a critical edge to them, making comments on the state of society and on the advertisements themselves.\\" This can be explicitly political (as his pieces on Sean Bell, \\"IRAN = NAM\\", \\"Obama Drama,\\" and Gaza), or a more general send up of celebrity and corporate culture. Poster Boy has been called the \\"Matisse of subway-ad mash-ups,\\" \\"a kind of anti-consumerist Zorro with a razor blade,\\" and \\"an anti-consumerist guerilla artist.\\" Culture reporter Ben Walters has said of his work \\"Poster Boy's work straddles two boisterous artistic subcultures: street art and culture jamming.\\" Poster Boy has said of his technique, \\"No matter what I do to the piece, as long as I did something to those advertisements and that saturation, it's political. It's anti-media, anti‚Äìestablished art world.\\" Poster Boy calls the work \\"A social thing, as opposed to being an artist making things for bored rich people to hang above their couch.\\" Besides the message of the individual piece, the aspect of producing anonymous public art that other people could do is part of the work. In a video interview, he has said of his work, \\"I want it to be free of copyright and free of authorship, as much as possible.\\" \\"The overall goal for Poster Boy is to inspire others. I'd love to see people take up the Poster Boy model and create change within their environment.\\" As his fame has grown, others have begun to emulate the technique. Whether these are unconnected individuals copying one original artist, or part of the \\"Poster Boy model\\" or \\"movement\\" has not been publicly confirmed. Poster Boy's work is transitive (usually ripped down by MTA employees) but recorded in photographs. Photos of most of his work put up on the Poster Boy photostream on the Flickr photo sharing website. Poster Boy has collaborated with Aakash Nihalani, a street artist who uses brightly colored electrical tape to create geometric patterns, and has worked on large outdoor monochrome pieces covering illegal NPA billboards with Jordan Seiler of the Public Ad Campaign. Poster Boy's work had recently grown in scale and he has applied his technique to large billboards. He seems to have been unaware of the somewhat similar and earlier billboard work of the UK group Cutup. In March 2009, a major installation of subway advertising by the Museum of Modern Art at the Atlantic / Pacific subway stop in Brooklyn, consisting just of reproductions of works shown in MOMA, was doctored by what was claimed to be \\"the mysterious Poster Boy collective\\" along with Doug Jaeger of thehappycorp. The cutups included part of a Goodyear tire appearing to be floating with Monet's waterlilies. The initial Poster Boy work was all illicit, and he claimed \\"I don't want to make any money off of it. I don't want to bring it into the galleries.\\". However, after his arrest in January 2009 his work has been shown in galleries, including a one-person show in Eastern District Brooklyn, April 3‚Äì26, 2009. He was also included in the group show, Razors, Tape, Glass, at Jajo Gallery in Newark New Jersey. This move has been criticized in the street art blogs. Legal issues Poster Boy's cutting and pasting of subway advertisements is illegal. Previously their work had been noted by the MTA police, but did not seem a high priority for them. \\"Vandalism of our property is illegal, and we prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,\\" spokesperson Aaron Donovan told reporter Brian Raftery. \\"That being said, the problem to date has been minimal.\\" He has had several brushes with the law, but on occasions transit police have let him go. On January 30, 2009, while attending a benefit for Friends We Love artist's video documentaries, a person thought to be Poster Boy was arrested by undercover police agents waiting for him. This \\"Poster Boy\\" was charged with two misdemeanor counts of criminal mischief and went before a Judge on February 9, 2009. At the hearing, Poster Boy member Henry Matyjewicz, 27, rejected a plea bargain, where he would plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief, and perform 100 hours of \\"community service.\\" His lawyer, Kerry Gotlib, said his Mr. Matyjewicz was \\"innocent of the charges\\". Mr. Matyjewicz is scheduled to appear back in court in April. If the case goes to a trial the top penalties for the charges could be jail for up to one year. However, on December 16, 2009, Matyjewicz pleaded guilty to the offenses. In exchange, the judge agreed to vacate the felony provided Matyjewicz served 210 hours of community service. Once completed, he would get three years' probation. Sometime around January 2009, Poster Boy's underground fame became such that there seemed to be several imitators, and his idea of having others \\"take up the Poster Boy model\\" seemed to be catching on. There even seems to be some confusion over whether the Poster Boy, arrested on January 30, 2009, was the same Poster Boy who initiated the subway collages, or a \\"legal\\" above ground stand in. The New York Times reports a call from Poster Boy saying the man who was arrested \\"is one of the many individuals who believe in the Poster Boy 'movement'\\" The Adbusters website notes that \\"Sources close to the artist maintain that there are, in fact, multiple 'Poster Boys' presently engaged in the project.\\" In an interview after the arrest, Henry Matyjewicz has said that \\"Henry is an artist just inspired by what's going on with the Poster Boy movement.\\" See also *Posterchild, a Toronto-based street artist *List of street artists in the United States *Street art ReferencesExternal links Articles and interviews: *Edward Winkleman. \\"The Search for True Selflessness in Art Making\\", 8 October 2008. *Randy Kennedy. \\"Poster Boy Is Caught, or Is It a Stand-In?\\" New York Times, 4 February 2009. *\\"Poster Boy, Street Artist\\" (interview).

V. RamasamyA biographical sketch (,) (17 September 1879 ‚Äì 24 December 1973), also known as Ramaswami, EVR, Thanthai Periyar was a Dravidian social reformer and politician from India, who founded the Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam.Thakurta, Paranjoy Guha and Shankar Raghuraman (2004) A Time of Coalitions: Divided We Stand, Sage Publications. New Delhi, p. 230. On the caste system in India, Periyar dealt harshly with the practice of discrimination and its subordination of the different levels it created in society. He attacked those who used the system to take advantage of the masses through exploitation and subjugation. Philosophy Periyar felt that a small number of cunning people created caste distinctions in order to dominate over society. That was why he emphasized the view that we must first develop self-respect and learn to analyze propositions rationally. A self-respecting rationalist will readily realize that caste system has been stifling self-respect and therefore he will strive to get rid of this menace. One of Periyar's quotes on caste was, \\"a sizable population today remains as Untouchables, and another sizable population exists in the name of Sudras and as serfs, coolies and menials. Who wants an independence that cannot help change these things? Who wants religion, scriptures and gods, which cannot bring about a change in this sphere\\"?Gopalakrishnan, Periyar: Father of the Tamil race, pp. 60 & 61. Periyar explained that the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked with the arrival of Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a different stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living.Diehl, E.V. Ramasamy Naiker-Periyar, p. 61. Periyar also mentions that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man considered to be a rational being, is suffering from these because of religion. He further explains that amongst dogs you do not have a Brahmin dog, or a Pariah (untouchable) dog. Among donkeys and monkeys we also do not find such things. But, amongst men there is such discrimination.Veeramani, Collected Works of Periyar, pp. 72 & 73. Periyar argued on how a person with an iota of sense or rationalism in could do such things such as giving special treatment only to Brahmins. Some examples practiced were for lower castes to fall at their feet and to even, sometimes, wash their feet and drink that water. Periyar explains that if this is Hindu doctrine and philosophy, such a religion must go. He gives examples of rituals such as christening, house warming, marriage, and for puberty, that they are for the Brahmin's gain as the only ones to conduct these occasions. We do not respect our knowledge nor are we ashamed of our actions. Are we merely a mass of flesh and bones? Why should anybody get angry when I say all these to make you think over. Who is responsible of our degradation? Is it religion or government\\"? Gandhi advocated for the caste system in its preservation. On the question of Untouchables being prevented from drawing water from wells and entering temples, Gandhi suggested having separate wells and temples made for them instead.Veeramani, Collected Works of Periyar, p. 523. Periyar argued against this by demanding the Vedas of Indo-Aryans to be burnt and their deities to be destroyed since it was their creation of the castes and Untouchables. He also went on to state that \\"it was absurd to quote religion, god, or religious doctrines to render people as lowest castes\\".Veeramani, Collected Works of Periyar, p. 511. Periyar argued that the caste system has \\"perverted peoples ideas about human conduct. The principle of different codes of conduct for each caste based on birth and life, led in accordance with it for centuries, have spoiled the Hindu mentality almost beyond repair, and destroyed the idea of uniformity in conduct. Graded inequality has got so much into the Hindu blood that general intelligence is warped and refused to mend even after English education and higher standards of living\\".Veeramani, Collected Works of Periyar, p. 463. Hereditary Education Policy In 1952, Rajaji introduced a new education policy based on family vocation which its opponents dubbed Kula Kalvi Thittam (Hereditary Education Policy). As per this policy, schools will work in the morning and students can help their fathers in their work in the afternoon. Thus, a carpenter‚Äôs son would learn carpentry, a priest's son chanting hymns, and a barber‚Äôs son would learn hair cutting and shaving after school. Periyar felt that this scheme was a clever device against Dalits and Other Backward Classes as their first generation was getting educated only then. Periyar demanded its withdrawal and launched protests against the Kula Kalvi Thittam which he felt was caste-based and was aimed at maintaining caste hegemony. Rajaji quit in 1954, and his successor Kamaraj scrapped it after becoming chief minister. Removal of caste names Periyar realized that the domination of Brahmins was not restricted to the spheres of administration and worship. It was found that most of the hotels in Tamil Nadu indicated on the name boards that they were maintained by Brahmins and only served Brahmins. Periyar organized agitations throughout Tamil Nadu for the removal of the words \\"for the brahmins\\" and \\"by the Brahmins\\" from the name boards of hotels. He drew the attention of the common people and particularly the philanthropists to this practice in the chowltries of feeding the Brahmins and non-Brahmins separately. Today this practice is no longer in existence. Inter-caste marriages Periyar encouraged inter-caste marriages in order to combat the superstitions of the caste system practiced in India. He pointed out that a marriage is a contract between a young woman and a young man and it is not a function for the parents to get involved in for a reason or another. Generally, orthodox elders arranged the marriages of their children and tried to perpetuate the dowry system. One of the projects of the Self-Respect Movement started by Periyar was to make young people realize that a marriage is the concern of a young man and a young woman and that other considerations brought in by the parents were utterly irrelevant. The Self-Respect Movement also pointed out that there were facilities for registering marriages and that the practice of employing Brahmin priests to conduct the marriages betrayed the superstition of the concerned people and encouraged exploitation by Brahmins. In the course of over the past fifty years, thousands of weddings between people of different communities and without the intervention of Brahmin priests have taken place as a result of the influence that the Self- Respect Movement has exerted on society. Arignar Anna in his capacity as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu passed a law in 1967 by which marriages conducted without the intervention of priests became lawful marriages. Service to the backward classes After entering the Congress in 1919, E.V.Ramasamy(Periyar) realized that the Brahmins had many more government jobs than the non-Brahmins and that higher education was more or less their prerogative. He wanted the Congress to pass a resolution demanding communal representation in education and in employment. Though he tried hard for five years continuously, he could not persuade the Congress party to realize the need for such a resolution. Therefore, he left the Congress, supported the Justice party, started the Self-Respect Movement and finally got the government of Madras to pass a law on communal representation in education and employment.Gopalakrishnan, Periyar: Father of the Tamil race, pp. 45-49. Kumarasami Kamaraj was thoroughly convinced that Periyar was only demanding justice for the non- Brahmins who had been neglected and exploited by certain sections of the people for hundreds of years. Therefore, he readily accepted Periyar's suggestion that poor people should have free education. When Kamaraj became Chief Minister of Madras he allowed all children to have free education up to standard ten. Through Periyar's spirit of social service, Kamaraj introduced the free mid-day meal scheme for school children and later granted free books and free clothes to school children. When Kalaignar Karunanidhi was Chief Minister in 1969, he extended free education up to the pre-university class. As a result of Periyar's devoted service for the cause of the under privileged, scheduled caste men and women occupy high positions in government offices and also serve as doctors and engineers.

Sicily is a large island off the Southern Italian coast. There has been a Jewish presence in Sicily for at least 1400 years and possibly for more than 2000 years. Ancient history There is a legend that Jews were first brought to Sicily as captive slaves in the 1st century after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE. However, it is generally presumed the Jewish population of Sicily was seeded prior to the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem. Rabbi Akiva visited the city of Syracuse during one of his trips abroad. The Jews of Sicily: A unique culture., By Sergio Caldarella, PJV#33 March 2008, The Philadelphia Jewish Voice, www.pjvoice.com Middle Ages The Kingdom of Sicily. The Jews lived in many Sicilian cities such as Palermo,Palermo, By: Richard Gottheil, Ismar Elbogen, jewishencyclopedia.com MessinaL'espulsione degli ebrei da Messina, MariaRosaria Previti Natoli and Catania.Catania, Italy, Encyclopedia Judaica www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org From the late 7th century, Sicily joined with Calabria to form the Byzantine Theme of Sicily. In the 6th century, communications were sent to Pope Gregory I about the plight of the Jews in the Kingdom of Sicily. In 831, Sicily came under the Arab dominion, which treated the Jews justly. In 1072 Sicily fell to the Normans and the Jews were again brought under the supremacy and jurisdiction of the Catholic Church. The Norman Kingdom of Sicily lasted until 1194, when it fell to the Hohenstaufens. In 1210, the Jews of Sicily faced such persecution from the Crusaders that Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II had to intervene on their behalf. Frederick also employed Jews from Sicily at his court to translate Greek and Arabic works.Sicilian Peoples: The Jews of Sicily by Vincenzo Salerno. Persecution of the Jews continued. But, despite persecution, Sicilian Jews continued to thrive. Some Sicilian rabbis communicated with Maimonides posing religious questions. Systematic persecution of the Jews in Sicily started in the 14th century. In 1310 the King of Sicily Frederick II of Aragon adopted a restrictive and discriminatory policy towards the Jews, who were required to mark their clothes and their shops with the \\"red wheel\\". Jews were also forbidden any relationship with Catholics. In 1392, Jews were ordered to live in ghettos and severe persecutions broke out in Monte San Giuliano (now Erice), Catania and Syracuse, in which many Jews fell victim. The next year strict decrees were directed against private ceremonies. For example, Jews were forbidden to use any decorations in connection with funerals; except in unusual cases, when silk was permitted, the coffin might be covered with a woolen pall only. In Marsala, Jews were compelled to take part in the festival services at Christmas and on St. Stephen's Day, and were then followed home by the mob and stoned on the way. At the beginning of the 15th century oppression was at such a level that in 1402 the Jews of Marsala presented an appeal to the king, in which they asked for: (1) exemption from compulsory menial services; (2) the reduction of their taxes to one-eleventh of the total taxation, since the Jews were only one-eleventh of the population; (3) the hearing of their civil suits by the royal chief judge, and of their religious cases by the inquisitor; (4) the delivery of flags only to the superintendent of the royal castle, not to others; (5) the reopening of the women's bath (Mikveh), which had been closed under Andrea Chiaramonte. This appeal was granted. In comparison with other Jewish communities of Europe, the Sicilians were happily situated. They even owned a considerable amount of property, since thirteen of their communities were able, in 1413, to lend the infante Don Juan 437 ounces of gold. This was repaid on 24 December 1415. In the same year, however, the Jewish community of Vizzini was expelled by Queen Blanca, and it was never permitted to return. The culmination of persecution came with the expulsion of Jews from Sicily. The decree of banishment dated 31 March 1492 was decreed by Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile - applying to Sicily The Alhambra Decree expelling the Jews from Spain itself. At the time there were around 25,000-30,000 Jews living on the island, in 52 different locations.Page 24, Guglielmo Raimondo Moncada alias Flavio Mitridate: un ebreo converso siciliano, Officina di Studi Medievali, 2008 On 9 June Jews were forbidden to depart secretly, sell their possessions, or conceal any property; on 18 June the carrying of weapons was prohibited; their valuables were appraised by royal officials on behalf of the state, packed in boxes, and given into the care of wealthy Catholics. On 13 August came the order to be ready to depart; the following articles might be taken: one dress, a mattress, a blanket of wool or serge, a pair of used sheets, a few provisions, besides three Taros as traveling money. All other Jewish property was confiscated by the Crown. After numerous appeals, the date of departure was postponed to 18 December, and later, after a payment of 5,000 gulden, to 12 January 1493. The departure actually occurred on 31 December 1492. The exiles found protection under Ferdinand I of Naples in Apulia, Calabria and Naples. On the death of Ferdinand in 1494, Charles VIII of France invaded Naples. At that time a serious disease, known as \\"French fly,\\" broke out in that region, and the responsibility for the outbreak was fixed upon the Jews, who were accordingly driven out of the Kingdom of Naples. They then sought refuge in Ottoman territory, and settled chiefly in Constantinople, Damascus, Salonica, and Cairo. Most of Sicily's Jewish population left the island. Around 9,000 Jews converted in order to remain in Sicily.ITALIA JUDAICA.

He was a professor at the University of Zagreb during the 1920s. Dvornikoviƒá was also an advocate of psychologism and animal philosophy. He is best known for authoring the book \\"Characterology of the Yugoslavs.\\" Biography Vladimir Dvornikoviƒá was born in Severin na Kupi, at the time in the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, Austria-Hungary. His father Ljudevit-Lujo was a pedagogue, and his mother Marjana was also an educator and a part-time publicist. Vladimir was the eldest of eleven children. Because of constant relocating due primarily to his parents' career, he finished elementary school in Dre≈ænik, and high school in Zemun and Sarajevo. In the 3rd year of high school he became interested in literature and was an enthusiastic reader of the works of Herbert Spencer and Ernst Haeckel. In 1906 Dvornikoviƒá travels abroad to study philosophy in Vienna. Professors who had tremendous influence on young Vladimir were Friedrich Jodl and Wilhelm Jerusalem. He received his doctorate from Vienna in 1911 with his thesis titled \\"About the necessity of the psychological establishment of the cognitive theory.\\" His plans on habilitation in Vienna were hindered due to the outbreak of the first World War. From 1910 and on he relocates to Sarajevo, Bihaƒá, and Zagreb to commit to teaching. Apart from dissertation, he profiles himself as a psychologist with the book \\"Both essential types of philosophizing - Attempt of psychological orientation in current philosophical currents\\", published in German in Berlin of 1917. During the first World War he was deported to Bihaƒá for labor because of his pro-Yugoslav orientation. In 1918 Dvornikoviƒá arrives in Zagreb where he works in a Musical school. During 1919 he begins lecturing at the University of Zagreb with the theme \\"Philosophy and Science.\\" In 1925 he becomes a regular professor on the board of directors for the \\"theoretic and practical philosophy and for the history of philosophy.\\" He is the fourth professor of philosophy in Croatia in half a century; his predecessors being Franjo Markoviƒá, ƒêuro Arnold and Albert Bazala. Rejecting, like Bazala, the old education-system scheme of Johann Friedrich Herbart, Dvornikoviƒá indulges himself in the search for proper philosophy, respectively referring to it as \\"our autochthonous philosophy.\\" Not scrupling to participation in his public life and pronouncement tribunals about current societal and political themes. A strong proponent of \\"integrated Yugoslavism\\" (the concept of the Yugoslav Democratic Party), he is an opponent to political demagogy and to the regime of his time. As a result, in 1926 - only a year prior to becoming a regular professor, at age 38 becomes retired. After his departure from the university, he becomes intensely active in public affairs. He recites over 400 lectures in public across all parts of united Yugoslavia, but also in Vienna, Prague, and Zurich. He annunciates discussions, various studies, essays, articles, displays, and criticisms. He moves to Belgrade and, after the establishment of the Sixth-of-January dictatorship, fully cooperates with the new regime. In 1933, he became the assistant of the ministry of education, but is soon retired (in 1934). He authors the book \\"Battle Idea\\" in 1937, and then writes his most famous book in 1939, titled \\"Characterology of the Yugoslavs.\\" During the second World War he lives withdrawn in Belgrade. After the establishment of Communist Yugoslavia, he is enrolled as a member of the \\"Commission for the constructing appellation in architecture.\\" He is a member from 1945 - 1950. He authors smaller articles regarding the history of culture, archeology, ethnology, and psychology. He was briefly involved in photography. Dvornikoviƒá died in Belgrade, in what was at the time the People's Republic of Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia. Yugoslav Characterology Written in Serbo-Croatian (Karakterologija Jugoslavena), the book addresses the need to establish a national character within the entire country. Dvornikoviƒá writes that it is important to \\"mix\\" up all elements of Yugoslavia and to create one people (the Yugoslavs). He claims that Serbs and Croats can only survive as a strong nation by integrating into one people (like the unification of Germans and Germany or that of Italians and Italy). The book did not dismiss the differences among people that inhabited Yugoslavia, but stressed that these differences were \\"contingent and temporary and that they mask a deeper and more profound racial unity\\". He also advocated the idea of a Dinaric race, and his book overall gives a comprehensive description of unitarist Yugoslav mythology.

DeHaan, young physician with family, c. 1917 Martin Ralph DeHaan (March 23, 1891 ‚Äì December 13, 1965) was an American Bible teacher, the founder of the Radio Bible Class, and the co-editor of a monthly devotional guide Our Daily Bread.  Early life  M. R. DeHaan was born in Zeeland, Michigan to Reitze and Johanna Rozema DeHaan, emigrants from the Netherlands.James R. Adair, M. R. DeHaan: The Man and His Ministry (Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing, 1969), 21. Reitze DeHaan was the town cobbler. After graduating from Zeeland High School in 1908, he attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, for a year before attending and graduating from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago in 1914.Adair, 32, 35. DeHaan established a country practice in Byron Center, Michigan, about fourteen miles east of his home town. The practice frequently pushed him near exhaustion, at no time more so than during the 1918 flu pandemic, when for five days he never took off his clothes. He enjoyed the work of a physician, especially when fast thinking allowed him to save or improve lives. He even diagnosed his own mother's diabetes by looking at her eyes and was able to prescribe insulin, only recently invented.Adair, 41-59.  Pastor  Although he had been reared in a devout home and was a regular church goer, DeHaan acquired \\"a rather stout appetite for alcohol\\" during his years of medical practice. In October 1921 he suffered a violent reaction to an injection of horse serum and hovered in critical condition at a Grand Rapids hospital, where he later wrote he \\"was born again of the Spirit.\\" DeHaan said he had told God, \\"Spare my life and I'll serve You.\\" Afterward, when a grateful patient presented DeHaan with a bottle of liquor, he emptied it down the drain. In the early spring of 1922, he returned home one day from house calls and told his wife, \\"I can't go on any longer. This is it!\\" He sold his medical practice, home, and office equipment and entered Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Michigan, practicing a bit of medicine on the side to pay the bills.Adair, 58-65,70. After graduating from seminary in 1925, DeHaan took his first pastorate at Calvary Reformed Church in Grand Rapids, where he attracted large audiences both at the church and on radio. Doctrinally he was Reformed but leaned toward premillennialism as expounded in the Scofield Reference Bible‚Äîeven more so as he studied Scofield, William L. Pettingill, Harry Ironside, and James M. Gray.Adair, 70-73. DeHaan's premillennialism shocked some of his Reformed brethren, but his refusal to perform infant baptism caused the actual break with the Grand Rapids Classis of the Reformed Church in America.Adair, 74-77. In March 1929, DeHaan resigned from Calvary Reformed Church and founded the Calvary Undenominational Church in a nearby theater. By 1930 the congregation of 700 members had moved to a new auditorium, which seated 2000. Extra chairs were brought in to accommodate the overflow.Adair, 79-85. However, in 1938, the church board fired the music director/youth minister without DeHaan's approval. DeHaan received approval of the congregation to rehire the minister and fire the board members. But when six men took legal action and obtained an injunction against DeHaan, he resigned. His health was also poor at the time. He had suffered his first heart attack in 1936 and another in 1938.Adair, 85-88.  Bible teacher  When he recovered, DeHaan began teaching Bible classes, sometimes to a thousand listeners at a time in weekday sessions. He also began broadcasting a half-hour program on the radio, at first in Detroit and then, by 1941, in Grand Rapids. Two national networks picked up the Radio Bible Class program, and its coverage grew to 600 stations around the world by the time of DeHaan's death. In 1956 DeHaan added the monthly Our Daily Bread devotional booklet to the sermons already being sent to listeners.Adair, 92. DeHaan co-edited the booklet with Henry Bosch (1914-1995). DeHaan was not only an able Bible teacher but an astute businessman whom other broadcasters consulted to make their own operations more efficient.Adair, 98-99. After Radio Bible Class dedicated a new building in 1958, DeHaan told an associate, \\"This thing is scaring me more than ever. I never envisioned this. I don't know why God ever picked me.\\"Adair, 100.  Personal life  In 1914, DeHaan married Priscilla Venhuizen, and they had four children, including Richard DeHaan, who succeeded his father as director of the Radio Bible Class.Adair, 34-36, 120. It was a source of satisfaction to DeHaan that as a doctor he had delivered all four of his children and then as a clergyman had married all of them.Adair, 125. \\"Tact was not his strongest virtue.\\" DeHaan was likely to crash his fist into his hand or his desk to emphasize a point to his staff and demand that things be done his way. However, he was not reluctant to apologize, and he also mellowed with the years.Adair, 100-01. Once in the 1940s he found that he was supposed to share the platform with a \\"gospel horse\\" who could answer \\"How many persons in the Trinity?\\" by tapping three times. \\"DeHaan reddened and threatened to turn the entire program over to the horse.\\" The horse was retired to his trailer. (112) Once he and his wife had a disagreement and said nothing to each other during breakfast. When it was time to read the devotional in Our Daily Bread, she pushed it under his nose and said, \\"Are you the man who wrote this?\\" It was an article on kindness and forbearance. \\"That did it,\\" said DeHaan, \\"We had to make up right there.\\"Adair, 129. DeHaan refused offers of honorary degrees, preferring to have only the M.D. after his name. He kept up with medical advances, offered medical advice in some of his messages and books, and once saved the life of a woman whose trachea had been blocked by a piece of chicken.Adair, 101-02. DeHaan reveled in simple hobbies such as vegetable gardening, fly fishing, beekeeping, and investigating abandoned houses.Adair, 113, 116, 123. He disliked social engagements but enjoyed talking with radio listeners whom he met in his travels.Adair, 112, 127-28.  Death  In 1946, when DeHaan suffered a third heart attack and was sidelined for several months, his son Richard substituted for him. In February 1965, he experienced severe chest pains while preaching at Moody Bible Institute, and that proved to be his last public appearance. In July he was seriously injured in an automobile accident. Weakened by his heart condition, he died at home on December 13, 1965.Adair, 97-98, 152, 156.

V. Rao, based on the 1891 Malayalam novel by C. V. Raman Pillai. This was the first film based on Malayalam literature and the next film of the Malayalam film industry after Vigathakumaran. Plot Based on the novel Marthandavarma, the film recounts the adventures of the crown Prince, Marthandavarma on how he eliminates his arch rivals one by one, so as to ascend to the throne of Kingdom of Travancore.

Padmanabha Menon * Pattammal * Pious * Sunder Raj * Kesava Menon * Thilakam The casting credits of the above artists variably contradict in the sources. The character Marthanda Varma is attributed to the actor Jaidev in IMDb, whereas in Weblokam (Malayalam Webdunia), the same character is attributed to actor Andi, who is referred to as a Tamil from Thalassery. The possibility of the name Jaidev being the screen alias of Andi conflicts with the information in Cini Diary, where both the names are listed separately under the artist credits of the movie. Weblokam further states that Tamil actresses Pattamal and Devaki Bhai donned the roles of Subadra and Sulaikha respectively, of which the former's character credit brings up another contradiction as Cini Diary states Pattamal is Padmini or rather Pattamal's screen alias is Padmini, who is attributed to the character Parukutty in IMDb. The producer R. Sunder Raj has done the role of Bheeram Khan, whereas A. V. P. Menon and V. Naik did the roles of Anantha Padmanaban and Padmanabhan Thampi, respectively. Crew A short list of crew behind the film * Producer - R. Sundar Raj * Screenplay, Direction ‚Äì P. V. Rao * Cinematography ‚Äì Pandurang E. Naik Production The film was produced by R. Sunder Raj under the banner of Shri Rajeswari Films and production of the film was started in 1931, during which the producer ignored the queries regarding the copyright of the novel related to adapting it to the film. The film had title cards in English and Malayalam, some of which were taken from the original text. A few of the title cards and actions make reference to the Swadeshi movement. The film also featured with a seven- minute actual newsreel footage of temple procession of the late Sri. Chithira Thirunal Maharaja of Travancore. Release The movie was released through Shri Rajeswari Films in 1933 at Capitol theatre, Thiruvananthapuram of Thiruvithaankoor. The movie ran into copyright problems during its release with the publishers of the novel in that period, Kamalalaya Book Depot and was withdrawn from screenings after its opening day, following a court order marking the first copyright case in the Indian film industry and literature publishing of Kerala. The print of film was under the custody of Kamalalaya Book Depot until 1974, when the National Film Archive of India negotiated and acquired the same. Apparently, this film also contain the first lip kiss of Indian Cinema. A print of film, which is the only silent film of south India fully available as of now is preserved at the National Film Archive of India (NFAI), Pune. The film was reportedly shown at the 1994 Film Festival of Kerala. In 2011, this film was screened at the \\"Filka\\" International film festival in Thiruvananthapuram.

Gilbert was the first graduate of Paine College, the first African-American professor of that school, and the first African-American to receive an advanced degree from Brown University. Early life Gilbert was born to slaves in Hephzibah, Georgia, though he grew up in nearby Augusta. He was named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. Until he left Georgia, Gilbert \\"spent half the year on the farm and the other half in the public schools of the city of Augusta.\\" After finishing public school, Gilbert enrolled in the Augusta Institute (later the Atlanta Baptist Seminary, a predecessor of Morehouse College). In 1884, he enrolled in the newly opened Paine Institute (later known as Paine College), which had been established as an \\"interracial\\" venture between the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1886, he was given financial assistance to transfer into the junior class of Brown University. There, he was among the first ten black students to attend the school and among the forty African-Americans to graduate from any northern university between 1885 and 1889. Gilbert received his bachelor's degree from Brown in 1888. He then moved back to Georgia, where in 1889 he married Osceola Pleasant, a graduate of Fisk University and the Paine Institute. Work in Greece While at Brown, Gilbert received a scholarship to attend the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece -- at the encouragement of Albert Harkness, a prominent classicist involved in the school's foundation.Adelaide M. Cromwell, Martin Kilson, Apropos of Africa: Sentiments of Negro American Leaders on Africa from the 1800s to the 1950s, Routledge, 1969, pp 116., He was the first African American to attend that school, and remained the only one to have done so through 1901.Henry F. Kletzing, et al. Progress of a Race, J. L. Nichols., 1903. pp. 520. During his time in the country, Gilbert was given an award for \\"excellence\\" in Greek. He was there from 1890-1891 and conducted archaeological excavations on Eretria with John Pickard, producing the first map of Ancient Eretria. Their work supposedly uncovered the \\"tomb of Aristotle,\\" a claim that was quickly disproven.leftFor his work in Greece, Gilbert in 1891 became the first African-American to receive an advanced degree from Brown. He received his master's thesis on the topic of \\"The Demes of Attica\\" (now unfortunately lost). In 1897, Gilbert was honored with election to the American Philological Association.  Work as an educator  In 1891, Gilbert returned to Augusta, Georgia and began to teach Greek, French, German, Latin, and Hebrew at his former school, Paine College. His appointment caused an uproar, since he was the first black faculty member at Paine. Other faculty decried \\"the evil\\" of this \\"revolutionary measure.\\" His appointment was also important because of his classical education: as a Paine professor later put it, \\"this was to be a college, and to be a college, you had to teach Greek and Latin.\\" He was remembered at Paine most of all as an \\"an exacting teacher\\" who \\"would not tolerate weak excuses,\\" since \\"he knew from personal experience that only diligence and plain hard work produced scholars.\\" He is supposed to have said: \\"If you would like to realize your own importance put your finger in a bowl of water, take it out, and look at the hole.\\" Students later recalled that > the exacting scholar corrected a startled student for his use of a Greek > verb. The student, abashed, protested, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs exactly the way it is in > the textbook.‚Äù Gilbert, they report, replied, \\"Then the textbook is wrong. > Bring it here.\\" The textbook was wrong as Gilbert immediately pointed out to > the publisher. It was changed in the next edition. In 1913, Gilbert was appointed the president of Miles College. He served in that post for one year before returning to Paine College.  Work as a missionary  In 1911 and 1912, Gilbert undertook a mission to the Belgian Congo with Walter Russell Lambuth, a (white) bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Gilbert believed that \\"Africa needs thousands of teachers, graduates of Atlanta, Fisk, Moorehouse, Paine, and similar institutions; for, besides possessing by nature the race instinct, they are better suited physically for work in Africa than their white brethren.\\" Similarly, Lambuth argued that southern Methodists were suited to successfully evangelize Africa: \\"We are born and brought up with black men. They understand us, and we understand them. We understand their good qualities and their bad qualities.\\" Lambuth and Gilbert cooperated well; Lambuth praised Gilbert's language skills, writing that his translations were \\"so well done that the Colonial Minister, upon my subsequent visit to Brussels, inquired who wrote the letters, and remarked that they were the most correct and elegantly expressed among those received at his office from one who was not a native of either France or Belgium.\\" Gilbert's passion for languages and sense of the ‚ÄúSouthern Negro‚Äôs debt and responsibility to Africa‚Äù even led him to compile a vocabulary and grammar for Tetela, a language spoken in the area of their work. John Wesley Gilbert with Bishop Lambuth of the MECS on their mission to the Belgian Congo. Gilbert and Lambuth successfully established a church and school in the village of Wembo-Nyama. This school would later educate Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and an icon of anticolonialism and pan-Africanism. In its current form as the Patrice-Emery-Lumumba University of Wembo-Nyama, this school is supported by American Methodists to this day. The mission of Gilbert and Lambuth was remembered as an exemplar of interracial partnership. However, even from the beginning there were \\"persistent rumors that the Belgian government was not highly cordial to Gilbert‚Äôs return.\\" Rather than a joint mission of the (black) CME and (white) MECS, by the 1920s and 30s the Methodist missionaries in Wembo-Nyama were exclusively white. Sylvia Jacobs argues that \\"probably the greatest obstacle was the Belgian government, which refused to issue permits to African Americans seeking to reside in the Belgian Congo\\" because of prior agitation against Belgian atrocities. Reception and legacy Gilbert was ill by 1921 and died on 18 November 1923 in Augusta, Georgia. Soon after his death, The Spirit of John Wesley Gilbert was published as a kind of eulogy. The author outlined the \\"Gilbert program ‚Ä¶ in the following sentences: No two races can live together, interlarded, under the same laws, but with different race marks and proclivities, in anything like peace without a program of 'good will' and interracial understanding.\\" Gilbert's contemporary reception and later legacy were complex. His beliefs in interracial partnership were controversial at the time. African-American newspapers and magazines ‚Äî including The Horizon, edited by W. E. B. Du Bois ‚Äî criticized his political views. The Appeal wrote that Gilbert would \\"make the Afro-American ‚Ä¶ just as he was in the times of slavery, perfectly willing to accept the white man as massa,\\" going on to write that \\"in the opinion of THE APPEAL, Rev. (?) Gilbert is a flunkey who deserves the contempt of every self-respecting Afro- American.\\" But Gilbert also had an immense positive influence as an educator and a role model, including on another prominent African American from Augusta, John Hope, the first black president of Morehouse College and one of the founding members of the Niagara Movement.Leroy Davis, A Clashing of the Soul, University of Georgia Press, 1998, pp 33. , Gilbert's alma mater, Paine College, dedicated a chapel in honor of him and Bishop Lambuth in 1968. In 1941, the city of Augusta built a low-income housing complex across the street from Paine College.Johnny Edwards \\"MCG plans memorial to Gilbert Manor namesake\\", Augusta Chronicle, January 29, 2009.

Enrique Hector Scalabroni (born 20 October 1949 in Alta Gracia, C√≥rdoba, Argentina) is an Argentinian race car designer, technical director, and team racing boss. He was employed by Dallara, Williams, Ferrari, Lotus and Peugeot Sport between 1985 and 2002, before setting up his own F3000 and GP2 team in 2003, BCN Competicion, which lasted till the end of 2008. Early career Scalabroni was born in Cordoba and studied mechanical engineering at the National Technological University in Buenos Aires before being recruited by the Formula Renault Fama team in 1975. He later worked for the Osvaldo Antelo Renault F2 and Miguel Herceg's Ford Turismo Carretera factory-backed teams. In Argentina he designed and built his own Formula Renault and national F2 single seater cars. Scalabroni arrived in Europe in 1982 from Argentina at the age of 32. He evolved to become one of the principal designers at Williams, chief designer at Ferrari and Lotus, and the Technical Director with the Asiatech F1 engine manufacturing company. Formula One Scalabroni moved to Italy in 1982, finding a job with the Dallara Automobili group. There he designed the first company wind tunnel and one of the pioneer carbon monocoque chassis for small single seaters: a trend setting Formula 3 car with rearward sloping sidepods, for the 1983 season. In 1985, Williams F1 recruited Scalabroni as a designer. At Williams, Scalabroni contributed a substantial part of the six speed sequential gearbox design that Williams pioneered for F1 racing. As design leader, and under the direction of Patrick Head, he was a key member of the team that developed the FW11 and FW11B Honda-powered cars that won the F1 World Constructors Championships in 1986 and 1987. After John Barnard's tenure at Ferrari (1987‚Äì1989), Scalabroni joined the team as chassis and aerodynamics Chief Designer in September 1989. There he developed Barnard's Ferrari 640 carbon chassis. The Scalabroni- designed 641 and 641/2 Ferraris were designed in collaboration with Steve Nichols and won six races in 1990 with Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell. Ferrari took second place in the Constructors Championship. In 1991 Scalabroni was recruited by Lotus F1 Team, where he produced the Lotus 102B for drivers Johnny Herbert, Mika H√§kkinen and Julian Bailey. Before leaving the Hethel team, Scalabroni left one audacious project: an F1 car with the four wheels set up as a cross or rhomboid, two at the sides, protruding from the middle section and one each at the front and rear. Lack of financing ended this project. At the same time, the South American engineer was consultant for the De Tomaso Guar√†, in charge of chassis and suspension design. In this role with the De Tomaso company Scalabroni also worked on the development of the Bigu√°, subsequently known as Qvale Mangusta, after the De Tomaso family sold the firm's assets to new American investors. Le Mans with Peugeot In 1992, Scalabroni went to Peugeot Sport, then concentrating on the World Sportscar Championship and the Le Mans 24 Hours. There, Scalabroni assisted in the development of the Peugeot 905, working with Andr√© de Cortanze, and was in charge of the 1992 Le Mans-winning car of Derek Warwick, Yannick Dalmas and Mark Blundell. At the same time, Jean Todt, then team director, entrusted Scalabroni with the ‚Äúavant projet‚Äù of the Peugeot Formula 1 car. When the PSA top executives denied Todt the resources necessary for an F1 team, the mercurial racing boss left for Ferrari and, soon afterwards, Scalabroni was on his way to a company owned by Takeo Ikuzawa. Ikuzawa wanted to establish his own F1 team and during two years Scalabroni and a small team of engineers designed and aerodynamically tested the scale models of the future car. That project was stopped, but Scalabroni remained with Ikuzawa till 1998 designing different systems for the Japanese automotive and motorcycle industry, claiming several patents in the process. Williams re-hired him in 1998 and the team's BTCC Renault Lagunas used efficient aerodynamic and mechanical solutions from Scalabroni. Other work When his consultancy agreement with Williams ended, Scalabroni started, late in 1999, what was to be the Asiatech engine Formula 1 project. Scalabroni agreed a deal with Peugeot to purchase the assets of Peugeot's F1 engine program, renamed Asiatech F1, and kept the factory and personnel. While Asiatech gave its engines to Arrows in 2001, Scalabroni started a technical office to design an F1 chassis in the former Williams BTCC premises at Didcot, England, financed by the same group of companies which owned Asiatech, and headed by Hideo Morita, the heir of the Sony Corporation founder. In 2002 Asiatech was Minardi's engine supplier but, unable to find proper financing and customers, the company closed its door at the end of the year. In 2003, Scalabroni established his own team, BCN Competici√≥n, based in Granollers, Barcelona, Spain, associated to his Spanish friend Jaume Pintanel. With Scalabroni at the helm, BCN Competici√≥n competed in Formula Nissan Lights in 2002, then in a Formula 3000 with which Enrico Toccacelo gave the team a victory and second position in the 2003 championship. Scalabroni got one of the GP2 licenses in 2004 and remained in that series till the end of 2008. At the end of the 2008 season, Scalabroni sold the GP2 license and cars to a group of companies represented by Portuguese driver Tiago Monteiro, who set up the new Ocean Racing Technology team. When the deal was clinched, Scalabroni concentrated on other new projects.

Initially trained as an anthropologist specializing in field studies of Latin American and Mesoamerican indigenous cultures, Warren has also written and lectured on an array of broader anthropological topics. These include studies about the impacts on politically marginalized and indigenous communities of social movements, wars and political violence, transnationalism, and foreign aid programs. Warren holds an endowed chair as the Charles C. Tillinghast Jr. ‚Äô32 Professor in International Studies at Brown University,. Before joining the faculty at Brown in 2003, Warren held professorships at both Harvard and Princeton universities. Studies and academic career Warren enrolled in undergraduate studies at University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965, where she completed a B.A. in cultural anthropology and cultural geography in 1968. Her graduate studies in cultural anthropology were undertaken at Princeton, where she completed her M.A. in 1970 and was awarded a PhD in 1974. The year before completing her doctorate Warren took up a position as an instructor in anthropology at Mount Holyoke College, a liberal arts women's college in Massachusetts. In 1982 Warren moved to Princeton University as associate professor. The same year she became the founding director of the Program in Women's Studies at Princeton. In 1988 Warren was made full professor, and from 1994 served as chair of the Anthropology Department. Warren transferred to Harvard as professor in anthropology in 1998, and lectured there for the next five years. In 2003 she took up several concurrent appointments at Brown University -- as Tillinghast Professor in International Studies, professor in anthropology, research professor at Watson Institute for International Studies. From 2011 to 2014, she served as director of the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women. Honors Her awards include a Fulbright Senior Research Fellowship, Abe Fellowship (Japan), the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales Fellowship, Member of Institute for Advanced Study, John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, Wenner-Gren Fellowship, and the Lewis Henry Morgan Lectures. Research and fieldwork In the early 1970s after completing her M.A., Warren conducted ethnographic field research among the Maya peoples of the Guatemalan highlands. Her work here formed the basis of her first book, The Symbolism of Subordination: Indian Identity in a Guatemalan Town (1978). Warren returned to Guatemala to update and continue her research in this area in 1989, and throughout the 1990s she spent a succession of annual field seasons among rural and urban highland Maya communities. This resulted in another book, Indigenous Movements and Their Critics: Pan-Maya Activism in Guatemala (1998). Warren spent the better part of the decade from 1974 to 1985 involved with field assignments to the Andes and rural Peru, conducting a research program into social change, identity, and gender roles and constructs among the rural and indigenous Peruvian communities. Much of the research was carried out in collaboration with Susan Bourque, a politics and government academic from Smith College, with whom she co-authored Women of the Andes: Patriarchy and Social Change in Rural Peru, an ethnographic book that won several awards.

Nichiren, Matsubagayatsu and Ankokuron‚Äìji Kamakura is known among Buddhists for having been during the 13th century the cradle of Nichiren Buddhism. Founder Nichiren wasn't a native: he was born in Awa Province, in today's Chiba Prefecture, but it had been only natural for a preacher like him to come to Kamakura because at the time the city was the cultural and political center of the country.Mutsu (1995/2006:258-271) He settled down in a hut in the Matsubagayatsu district where three temples (Ankokuron-ji itself, My≈çh≈ç‚Äìji, and Ch≈çsh≈ç-ji), have been fighting for centuries for the honor of being the sole heir of the master. All three say they lie on the very spot where he used to have his hut, however none of them can prove its claims. The Shinpen Kamakurashi, a guide book to Kamakura commissioned by Tokugawa Mitsukuni in 1685, already mentions a strained relationship between My≈çh≈ç‚Äìji and Ch≈çsh≈ç‚Äîji.Kamiya (2006:141) However, when the two temples finally went to court, with a sentence emitted in 1787 by the shogunate's tribunals My≈çh≈ç‚Äìji won the right to claim to be the place where Nichiren had had his hermitage. It appears that Ankokuron-ji did not participate in the trial because the government's official position was that Nichiren had first his hut there when he first arrived in Kamakura, but that he later made another near My≈çh≈ç‚Äìji after he came back from his exile in Izu in 1263. Ankokuron-ji is named after the , Nichiren's first major treatise and the source of the first of his three persecutions. Because of it, he was almost executed, pardoned and banished to Sado Island.Mutsu (1995/2006: 287-288) The essay is said to have actually been written in the small cave visible at the right of the temple's entrance. The black stele erected in 1939 by the Kamakura Seinendan which stands in front of the temple's gate commemorates the fact:Original Japanese text available here > In 1253 Nichiren arrived in Kamakura from Kominato in Awa province (Chiba) > (today's Chiba prefecture), settled down here and started chanting the Lotus > Sutra. This is the place where later, for three years beginning in 1257, he > wrote his essay Rissh≈ç Ankoku Ron in a cave. Features of the temple stone lanterns brought from Z≈çj≈ç-ji, in Tokyo The stone lanterns near the gate were brought here from Tokyo's Z≈çj≈ç-ji, one of the two Tokugawa funerary temples. To their right lies the so-called , built on the place where Nichiren wrote the Rissh≈ç Ankoku Ron. The old tree in front of it is said to have been planted by Nichiren himself, who had brought the sapling from Chiba. Further ahead lies the main hall, rebuilt in 1963 after having been destroyed by fire. Beyond the main hall, in the cemetery lies Nichiren's funerary pavilion, which contains his ashes. . Above it, the is the place where Nichiren is supposed to have hidden in 1260 when attackers burned his hut down. The statue of a white monkey in it commemorates his salvation at the hands of the animal, who led him to safety and fed him. The white monkey is an attendant of the Sann≈ç Gongen, a kami who is a manifestation of Buddhist god Taishakuten. Following the mountain path beyond the cave one reaches first, on a ridge above the entrance, the temple's bronze Bell of Peace, then the spot where Nichiren used to go every day to see Mount Fuji, the Fujimidai. From it are visible, besides the volcano, the city of Kamakura, its beach, and Hakone. Going down the stone stairs the visitor returns to the entrance, where stands the (an Inari shrine enshrining a samurai who served Nichiren).The presence of a Shinto shrine within a Buddhist temple is an example of the co- presence of Indian Buddhism and Japanese kami worship (shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç).

The photograph on the album's cover is by John Cohen and shows visual artist Mary Frank (spouse of Robert Frank), circa 1960. The back cover's photograph features artist Red Grooms crossing Third Avenue in 1960.  Concept  In an interview with Impose Magazine, Henry stated that he wanted the album to be less about the production, and geared more toward the feel of \\"a band playing in a room.\\" This approach is evident from the more stripped-back and raw feel of the album compared to the polish and sophistication heard on his previous three albums. Civilians is less upbeat and more influenced toward jazz and folk, which have melancholy undertones.  Reception  The album received generally strong praise across the board, achieving an average score of 77 on Metacritic.Civilians on Metacritic Thom Jurek of Allmusic praised the album for its straightforward sound, and that Civilians is \\"the evidence of what pop music can and should be, profound without being self conscious, elegant while wearing its seams in plain view, and full of speech both lyrically and musically that invites the listener in for a real conversation.\\"[ Allmusic review] Dan Ouellette of Billboard was impressed with the anecdotal qualities of the album, especially on the track \\"Our Song\\".Billboard review Meanwhile, Joshua Klein of Pitchfork Media criticized the album for its sound, describing the tempo as \\"dour\\", and expressed some dissatisfaction for the album's social commentary on American life.

The film stars Hiran Chatterjee, Koyel Mallick, Rahul Banerjee, and Sohini Paul (the daughter of Tapas Paul). It was Paul's second film after her debut in Bow Barracks Forever. Plot The film is about a reality show organized by Star Ananda, where the two finalists, Arka (Hiran Chatterjee) from the hills and Dodo (Rahul Banerjee) from Sundarbans Sajnekhali, are given two tasks to fulfill. Dodo is given the duty of a police constable at Bhawanipur police station while Arka is given the duty of a driver. They have three days and two nights to battle out and win the prize of Rs. 1 million. The one who makes fewer mistakes wins the jackpot. Anchor Suman Dey becomes the host, a runaway from a mental hospital. Mayhem begins when Piu's older sister and brother-in-law report at the Bhawanipur police station (where Dodo and Mithu are posted) and Arka comes to know about Piu's problems. As Arka and Dodo are in disguise, they use fake names to cover up their identity. Arka becomes Jackie and Dodo becomes Potla. Thus while Arka flees to the hills with Piu to fulfill his job and win the money, Dodo with Goldar and Mithu start chasing them, not knowing that Piu is actually with Arka. After a lot of hue and fuss Arka manages to take Piu to her lost love (she was escaping only to find her lost love, Abhirup) and Dodo catches up with them. Arka and Dodo are crowned champions. Arka donates the entire Rs. 5 million for Piu's medical expenses. Dodo donates his share of Rs. 5 million for the same noble cause. It is revealed that Dodo and Arka are best friends and Dodo had persuaded Arka to participate in the show. Mithu and Dodo become love birds, while Arka devotes his concentration to the orphaned, lonely and mentally stagnated Piu.

He founded Shree Samarth Prasadik Aadhyatmic Seva Samiti and spent his life spreading the philosophy of the saint Samarth Ramdas, writer of the devotional books Dasbodh, Manache Shlok, and Atmaram. Dharmadhikari had millions of followers across the world. He was also awarded by many government and social organisations for his work. In 2008, the Government of Maharashtra conferred upon him the Maharashtra Bhushan Award, which is highest civilian award being given by Government of Maharashtra. Dr. Nanasaheb Dharmadhikari was born to a family having original surname as Shandilya , in their lineage. Nearly 350 years ago, his ancestors were rewarded for their social reforming work with new title named Dharmadhikari (Authority of Dharma); by the navy chief Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre who was ruling Konkan Coast at that time, {Kanhoji Angre (August 1669 ‚Äì 4 July 1729) was the chief of the Maratha Navy in 18th century India, Sarkhel is a title equal to Admiral of a fleet}. Dr Nanasaheb Dharmadhikari got their inspiration from a scripture named Shrimat Daasbodh(or just Dasbodh), which he studied since childhood. After several years, he started an uncommon social reform service on 8 October 1943, on the event of Vijayadashami i.e. commonly known as Dussehra. In this social reform service he started giving spiritual or inspirational speeching (often called Nirupan) on all lessons of Dasbodh weekly, one by one. Initially there were only seven people's attending to hear speech, but as years passed on, more and more people's join in, making a vast family of 10's of millions. Today, such service (also called Parmartha ) is present in multiple Nations such as UAE, London, Singapore, Australia, Nigeria, Iran and so on. At the Initial stage, Dr Nanasaheb had to walk longer distances, some as long as 70 km so as to reach spot where speech on Dasbodh is to be provided, he was providing speech to people's attended, whether one or thousand. He was always helpful in solving people's issues through correct guidance, resolving superstitious thoughts, only through speech.

FT4 plant The NZED constructed a 220 MW gas turbine power station on this site, which began operation in 1978. This power station comprised four Pratt & Whitney twinpac units, each with two FT4 gas turbines (based on the JT4A). This plant was fueled with diesel, which meant electricity generation was expensive and the plant operated very rarely. In 1993, one twin-pac unit was moved to construct a gas fired cogeneration plant at the Te Awamutu dairy factory. In 2001, the remaining three units were sold and removed to become three of the six units at the Valley Power Peaking Facility in Australia. FT8 plant Following national power shortages in 2001 and 2003 due to low hydro lake levels, the New Zealand government commissioned Contact Energy to build reserve generation on the Whirinaki site. This plant was intended to be a generator of last resort, providing back up generation when needed, usually during years of low hydro lake levels, but also when there was a shortfall in generation reserves on the electricity market, such as after the failure of a major power station or the HVDC Inter- Island link. The power station cost $150 million and was opened in June 2004. The diesel powered power station was opened in 2004, and comprises three Pratt & Whitney twinpacs, each with two FT8 gas turbines. Designed to be a standby power station, it has a total capacity of 155MW. The power station was owned by the Government but maintained and operated by Contact Energy. The station was due to be transferred to Meridian Energy on the 1 October 2010 as part of the 2010 electricity market reforms. Meridian however refused to purchase the station, resulting in the New Zealand Government announced in December 2010 it will sell the plant by open tender. In 2011, the Ministry of Economic Development offered the plant for sale by competitive tender. It was purchased by Contact Energy on 22 December 2011.

In eukaryotes, this 5' monophosphate is a substrate for the 5' exonuclease Xrn1 and the mRNA is quickly destroyed. There are many situations which may lead to the removal of the cap, some of which are discussed below. In prokaryotes, the initial mRNA transcript naturally possesses a 5'-triphosphate group after bacterial transcription; the enzyme RppH removes a pyrophosphate molecule from the 5' end, converting the 5'-triphosphate to a 5'-monophosphate, triggering mRNA degradation by ribonucleases. Translation and decay Inside cells, there is a balance between the processes of translation and mRNA decay. Messages which are being actively translated are bound by polysomes and the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF-4E and eIF-4G (in eukaryotes). This blocks access to the cap by the decapping enzyme DCP2 and protects the mRNA molecule. In nutrient-starvation conditions or viral infection, translation may be compromised and decapping is stimulated. This balance is reflected in the size and abundance of the cytoplasmic structures known as P-bodies. Specific decay pathways A number of specific decay pathways exist that recognize aberrant messages and promote their decapping. Nonsense mediated decay recognizes premature stop codons and promotes decapping as well as decay by the exosome. Certain classes of miRNA have also been shown to stimulate decapping.

Carney served as a career Foreign Service Officer for 32 years, with assignments that included Vietnam and Cambodia as well as Lesotho and South Africa before being appointed as ambassador to Sudan and later in Haiti. Carney served with a number of U.N. Peacekeeping Missions, and until recently led the Haiti Democracy Project, an initiative launched under the presidency of George W. Bush to build stronger institutional foundations for the country's long-term relationship with the United States. In 2003, Carney was appointed to oversee America's reconstruction efforts in Iraq after the war that deposed Saddam Hussein. After a long diplomatic career, Carney served as Executive Vice President of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, a non-profit organization whose principal purpose was to assist Haiti's redevelopment in the aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake until the Fund rolled over operations in December 2012 to a domestic Haitian non-profit organization. Carney's appointment to diplomatic postings in countries that had often difficult relations with the United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style. His strong views on Iraq's reconstruction efforts after the war in 2003 were in part responsible for a wholesale change in the Bush administration's strategy to stabilize the war-torn nation. He also advocated engagement with Sudan at a time when White House officials and the C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in Khartoum. Personal life Carney was born in St. Joseph, Missouri and was raised and educated at military posts in the U.S. as well as abroad where his parents were stationed, including in Bad T√∂lz, Germany, Fort Bliss, Texas and Taipei, Taiwan. His father served in the United States Army in the early 1940s before being assigned to the Judge Advocate Generals Corps in 1948. His mother, daughter of a surgeon in St. Joseph, raised Carney and his two siblings as the family moved from one military posting to another. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966 and the U.S. Foreign Service sent him on a brief sabbatical to study at Cornell University from 1975 until 1976, focusing on Southeast Asian studies as part of his career. Carney was a member of the board of the American Academy of Diplomacy and speaks Khmer, Thai and French fluently. Carney is married to a free-lance journalist, Victoria Butler. He has a daughter from a previous marriage. He and his wife, both writers, have published, with a British photographer, a photographic essay on the Sudan. Foreign Service career=Early assignments= Carney began his Foreign Service Officer career in Vietnam in 1967 as a rotation officer based in Saigon for biographic and youth affairs and for commercial matters.Kennedy, p. 16 He was then stationed in Lesotho as second of two officers in charge of consular, political and economic affairs until 1971.Kennedy, pp. 26-27 In 1972, he was appointed Second Secretary at the U.S. Mission in Phnom Penh, before returning to the United States to study at Cornell University in 1975.Kennedy, p. 34 After spending a few years at the State Department's Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia desk, Carney was appointed as U.S. consul in Udorn, Thailand and later as political officer in Bangkok during the Third Indochina War from 1979 until 1983.Kennedy, pp. 64-65 After serving three year stints as the political counselor to U.S. Missions in Jakarta, Indonesia and Pretoria, South Africa (before Apartheid ended),Kennedy, pp. 73-75 Carney joined the U.S. Mission to the UN as political adviser for the 1989 UN General Assembly. On return to Washington he joined the White House National Security Council staff under President George H. W. Bush.Kennedy, p. 100 He focused on Southeast Asian and Pacific Island affairs. Carney cycled through several United Nations positions during the 1990s, serving from 1992 to 1993 as the Director of Information and Education of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, in 1993 as the Special Political Adviser to the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in Somalia,Kennedy, pp. 108-112 and in 1994 in the UN Observer Mission in South Africa as it prepared for the historic post-Apartheid transition to democracy in 1994.Kennedy, pp. 113‚Äì115 In 1994, Carney was appointed as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs. A year later, he would receive his first ambassadorial posting.Kennedy, p. 115 =U.S. Ambassador to Sudan= Carney was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Sudan on 27 June 1995 during a period of turmoil in U.S.-Sudan relations.Kennedy, p. 121 Osama bin Laden had fled Saudi Arabia for the safe confines of Khartoum a few years earlier, and Sudan's alleged harboring and abetting of Muslim extremists on its soil was attracting attention of counterterrorism experts in the United States and abroad. Carney's tenure as ambassador followed a tumultuous period during which his predecessor, Donald K. Petterson, had been forced to draw down embassy staff by half and send their families back to America when terrorist threats were made against U.S. diplomats stationed in Khartoum.Petterson, p. 71 In late 1993, Petterson was asked by officials in the Clinton administration to deliver a \\"non-paper\\" ultimatum to Sudan's Islamist leader, Hasan al-Turabi, and the country's president, Omar al-Bashir. The document contained a brief list of talking points that were designed to warn Sudan's top government officials about any involvement in alleged plots to kill U.S. diplomats working in Sudan. The alleged threats were based on evidence gathered by a foreign agent retained by the C.I.A., data which would be used to justify Petterson's reduction of American embassy personnel in Khartoum. The agent's information would later be found to have been fabricated, and would force the C.I.A. to redact or delete up to 100 reports on Sudan. Petterson would later state that he did not believe the intelligence findings warranted a draw down in embassy staff.Petterson, p. 69 Petterson's compulsory delivery of the talking points based on faulty U.S. intelligence would set the stage for strained relations between Washington and Khartoum that lasted well into Carney's early tenure as ambassador. In late 1995, Carney was also asked to deliver a similar non-paper message based on what he would later recount as having been poorly sourced U.S. intelligence. In early 1996, a few months after his credentials had been accepted, Carney met with senior Sudanese foreign ministry officials prior to vacating the U.S. embassy in Khartoum for the safer environs of Nairobi. He proposed tangible steps to recover the rapidly deteriorating relationship between Washington and Khartoum. In March 1996, El Fatih Erwa, then minister of state for defense, was authorized by President Omar al-Bashir to make several secret trips to the United States to hold talks with U.S. officials, including Carney and senior C.I.A. Africa experts, about U.S. sanctions policy against Sudan and what measures might be taken by the Bashir regime to lift them. During a series of meetings in northern Virginia, Erwa was presented with a list of U.S. requirements, including demands for information about bin Laden and other radical Islamic groups encamped in Sudan. The U.S. also demanded that the Bashir regime stop hosting the Popular Arab and Islamic Congress conferences that were increasingly perceived in the west as global terrorist planning sessions. Carney argued with State Department, C.I.A. and other U.S. officials, including Susan Rice, then the National Security Council's Africa Director, that Sudan's Mukhabarat (equivalent of the C.I.A.) was amassing volumes of valuable intelligence on Islamist leaders through their pilgrimages to Khartoum for the PAIC conferences. In May 1996, despite Carney's efforts to persuade U.S. officials to reconcile with Khartoum on intelligence matters, the Clinton Administration demanded that Sudan expel bin Laden. The Saudi fugitive fled to Afghanistan. Carney was relegated to shuttling from Nairobi to Khartoum to engage in his ambassadorial duties.Kennedy, pp. 129-130 Carney ended his post as ambassador in November 1997 to move to Haiti.Kennedy, p. 131 =U.S. Ambassador to Haiti= Carney arrived as U.S. Ambassador to Haiti on January 14, 1998. At the time of his appointment, Haiti was in political turmoil: former president, Jean-Bertrande Aristide, was locked in a battle to retake power in the election of 2000. Upon arrival in Haiti, Carney laid out U.S. concerns‚Äîlack of governance, lack of economic sustainability programs and an inability to prevent narco-trafficking through Haiti as the first port of call by the Cali drug cartels from Colombia.Kennedy, p. 132 American policy in the region was ineffective at the time. Carney's first task was to streamline reporting to Washington about ground realities in Haiti, as well as bringing in U.S. policymakers in to see firsthand what U.S. taxpayer dollars were funding in the country. Carney touted humanitarian successes of U.S. policy in Haiti, including success in preventing the spread of AIDS and providing lunch money to upwards of 500,000 Haitian students each school day. Microcredit financing efforts were also on display, as was the U.S. Coast Guard to monitor Haiti's coastline for Cali go-fast boats laden with cocaine shipments bound for the U.S. mainland.Kennedy, p. 136 Structural problems remained, however, including widespread political and judicial corruption, as well as police malfeasance. Haiti nevertheless slowly developed a more active civil society. As Aristide made his comeback, Carney made plans to retire to the private sector, and on December 11, 1999, resigned his post.Kennedy, p. 137 Shortly after his term as ambassador to Haiti had ended, U.S. Senator Mike DeWine commended Carney and his wife Vicki for their efforts to improve living conditions in Haiti on July 26, 2000, in a speech from the Senate floor, \\"...Tim and his wife Vicki proudly represented the United States. Day in and day out, they were committed to helping the people of Haiti overcome their dismal surroundings and their dire circumstances. Tim and Vicki worked to alleviate hunger and poverty throughout the island and encouraged practical economic reforms.\\" =Other assignments= In March 2003, Carney joined the staff of Lt. Gen. Jay Garner in Iraq and served for several months as a senior staff member in the Ministry of Industry and Minerals as part of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) that governed Iraq in the aftermath of U.S. forces overthrowing the regime of Saddam Hussein. Upon arrival in Baghdad, he became critical of the plan set out by CPA, making clear that Iraq czar Paul Bremer's ideological vision was impeding progress that could have been made to stabilize Iraq. He left Baghdad two months after arriving in April 2003, disillusioned by an inability to execute a more pragmatic plan for Iraq's reconstruction. Carney returned to Washington where he made known his disagreement with the Bremer plan. In 2007, under a significant reorganization of the Iraq reconstruction effort by the Bush administration that witnessed other policy dissenters return to Baghdad, Carney was asked by the State Department to return to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to oversee the overall U.S. effort to rebuild Iraq. He has also lectured on areas of his expertise on Iraq since 2004 to assist in readying U.S. Army and National Guard contingents for their assignments in Iraq. In 2007, Carney returned to Iraq from February until June to serve as Coordinator for Economic Transition and was again with the State Department as Head of the Interagency Election Support Team in Kabul from March until November 2009. Throughout his long foreign service career, Carney advocated a policy of \\"constructive engagement\\" with rogue countries, often against policy prescriptions formulated by White House advisers in the administrations for whom he worked. Viewed as something of a maverick diplomat, he was often at odds with senior national security officials as well as political appointees on both sides of the aisle in Washington. Haiti Democracy Project Carney in July 2011 The Haiti Democracy Project was officially launched at the Brookings Institution in November 2002 as a non- profit organization. Its funding was raised from Haitian-Americans and Haitians living in the United States, as well as other U.S. citizens. Its primary purpose was creating a more pragmatic and operative U.S. policy towards Haiti. As Haiti's economic situation had deteriorated during the second Aristide presidency, demonstrations proliferated everywhere throughout the nation and political dialogue broke down between opposition leaders and the Aristide government. Carney, who spoke at the inaugural event and later went on to become Chairman of the Board for the project, raised concerns about whether the United States government was paying attention to the gravity of problems that were beginning to affect Haiti's stability systemically. He criticized U.S. congressional leaders, particularly those in the Congressional Black Caucus, for a \\"do-nothing\\" attitude towards Haiti, much of which he had seen firsthand during his tenure as ambassador. The project was criticized as an elitist forum for wealthy right-wing Haitians to promote their own agendas for Haiti's future. Funding was provided, in material part, by controversial Haitian businessman Rodolphe Boulos who was involved in a pharmaceutical poisoning controversy in 1996. The project was seen as a platform for giving opponents of the Aristide administration a hearing in Washington. The Haiti Democracy Project's report, published on May 4, 2005, was attacked for drawing only on government bodies and officials who had a vested interest in the report's findings. Haiti's police officials were found to be the only source of information, for example, in reporting on police actions during the Aristide administration's time in office. Human rights findings were criticized for having \\"extreme bias\\" in the report. Clinton Bush Haiti Fund In the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti on January 10, 2010, President Barack Obama asked former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush to work together in raising funds for the rehabilitation and long-term recovery of Haiti. The Clinton Bush Haiti Fund was created as a 501(c)(3) organization and began operations in 2010. Carney served as executive vice president of the Fund until it ceased operations at the end of 2012. Its purpose was to assist Haitians in developing sustainable paradigms for medium- term and long-term economic growth as well as creating jobs that stabilize its domestic economy. The Fund raised $54 million, and during its term, the Fund estimated that its programs sustained or created 7,350 jobs, trained 20,050 individuals, and had an additional positive impact on the conditions of more than 311,000 Haitians.

It is based on the novel The Treasure by Selma Lagerl√∂f, originally published in 1903. The story takes place on the Swedish west coast during the 16th century, and revolves around a Scottish mercenary who murders a wealthy family for treasure, only to unwittingly begin a relationship with the surviving daughter of the family. Plot After discovering a conspiracy among his Scottish mercenaries, king Johan III orders them to leave the country and puts their commanders in jail. Sir Archie, Sir Filip and Sir Donald, three of the imprisoned commanders, succeed to escape and flee to Marstrand, then under Danish rule, in hope of being able to return to Scotland. Sir Arne of Solberga is introduced as a wealthy man who is said to be under a curse. His treasure is said to have been looted from the monasteries during the Protestant reform, and according to premonitions it will one day be his doom. While dining, Arne's wife has a premonition where three rogues are sharpening very long knives nearby, but is not taken seriously. At night however, the three Scots enter the family's mansion, murders the family, steals Sir Arne's treasure chest and burns down the building. The only survivor is the daughter Elsalill. Elsalill is taken care of by a fisherman who lets her live with him in Marstrand, where also the Scottish officers have arrived and are waiting for the ice to break so they can sail away. Eslalill encounters Sir Archie, and they both fall in love without recognising each other. Eventually however, Elsalill happens to overhear a conversation between the Scots, and understands who they are. She reports the criminals, but they are backed up by other former mercenaries who also are waiting for the first ship to leave, and the situation becomes violent. Among the fighting, the emotionally shaken Elsalill seeks Sir Archie who deeply regrets his crime, but in the ongoing turmoil, Elsalill is fatally wounded as Sir Archie uses her body as a shield to protect him from the guards who are trying to kill him. Sir Archie escapes to the frozen-in ship with Elsalill's dead body. The ice still won't break however, and according to sailor's lore it is because there are evildoers on board. The three officers are soon identified and thrown off the ship. A long procession march over the ice to fetch Elsalill's body and bring it back to land.

In 1917 a stage adaptation of the story premiered at Deutsches Theater in Berlin, and an offer was received from a German film company which wanted to adapt it. After the play was staged in Gothenburg the following year, Svenska Biografteatern decided to go ahead and produce the film themselves. The screenplay by Mauritz Stiller and Gustaf Molander differs from the novel in that it tells the story in a more strictly chronological order, and incorporates some details which were introduced in the German play. Stiller also chose to tone down the story's supernatural elements. Filming took place from 12 February to 10 May 1919, in the studio area of Svenska Filmbiografen, later AB Svensk Filmindustri, on Liding√∂, Stockholm, where the alleys of Marstrand had been reconstructed. Other exterior scenes were shot in the nearby area on Liding√∂ and Lilla V√§rtan, as well as around Furusund in the Stockholm archipelago, where the ship had been left over the winter and frozen in. Some filming took place further north in Skutsk√§r, and around Sollefte√• in √Öngermanland. The film featured handwritten intertitles by Alva Lundin and was the first film to use her artistic title cards. Other adaptations Two other film adaptations of the story exist. In 1954 Gustaf Molander directed another Swedish version. A Czechoslovak animated short film directed by V√°clav Bed≈ôich was made in 1967.

A heritage turkey, the Auburn is one of the rarest varieties currently in existence. It has been referenced by name in written records since the 18th century, and is named after the light reddish-brown color of its plumage. There is also an extremely rare variant of the Auburn, called the Silver Auburn. History This is an old variety that was listed in receipts when transporting turkeys to markets in \\"turkey trots\\" during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Philadelphia. They are sex linked and thus were important at the beginning of this century for producing poults that could be sexed at hatching. Cross-breedings of Auburn toms and Bronze hens were done to produce Bronze toms and Auburn hens thus making it quite easy to sex poults by color at hatch. However, this did not become a serious market requirement and they never became very popular. However, when breeding Auburn turkeys together, only auburn colored poults will be produced in both sexes. Types Auburn describes a variation in the typical bronze plumage color in which bronze is replaced with a red-brown pigmentation. At day of age, the Auburn poult resembles the Bronze but with black stripes replaced with a red-brown coloration. In the adult bird, the bronze pigmentation is also replaced by a red-brown color. The barring present in the primary and secondary flight feathers is red-brown and white in contrast to the black and white typical in the bronze bird.

Early life Karl G√∂lsdorf was born on 8 June 1861 in Vienna, the son of Louis Adolf G√∂lsdorf. Even as a schoolboy he was introduced to locomotive design by his father, the chief mechanical engineer (Maschinendirektor) of the Imperial and Royal Southern Railway (k.u.k. S√ºdbahn). From 1880 to 1884 he attended the Vienna Technical High School and completed his diploma with distinction. In 1885 he joined the Wiener Maschinenfabrik (Vienna engineering works) as a design engineer. In 1889 he became head of assembly for locomotive construction. On 1 November 1891 he joined the design office of the Austrian State Railway as an engineer-Adjunkt and began his creative work there. Inventions In 1893 he invented an effective starting system for compound locomotives. Until then the locomotive starting systems in common use in Austria, with its sometimes taxing railway lines, did not enable trains to be started reliably. Also thanks to G√∂lsdorf was the practical idea that a higher boiler pitch on steam locomotives had no real disadvantages. A study visit to England in 1899 was to heavily influence the use of form in his designs. G√∂lsdorf became especially well known as a result of his inventing the radially-sliding coupled axle for steam locomotives, the so-called G√∂lsdorf axle. The first engine to be equipped with this was an eight-coupled steam locomotive in 1897, the .The ten-coupled , whose first, third and fifth axles were able to slide sideways in the frame, demonstrated that, in almost all cases, locomotives with multi-part frames and complicated articulated designs would be superfluous. From that time forward this type of construction became the standard for heavy goods locomotives. No. 180.01 in Strasshof Railway Museum Class 108 locomotive From 1893 to 1916, Karl G√∂lsdorf was the chief design engineer of the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways (kaiserlich-k√∂niglichen √∂sterreichischen Staatsbahnen or kkStB) and developed 25 different classes of steam locomotive (in 47 variants) during his career. Amongst his designs were such well-known types as the Class 30 operated by the Vienna Stadtbahn, the Atlantics of classes and , and the ten- coupled . Notable 'special' designs included the rack railway locomotives of Class 269 for the Erzbergbahn and the narrow gauge Yv for the Ybbstalbahn. Karl G√∂lsdorf continually utilized the emerging technologies of the time. His locomotive of 1911, a six-coupled express locomotive with a four-cylinder, superheated compound engine, was one of the most elegant of its day and, since the reactivation of no. 310.23 in 1986, currently the most well-known product of the Austrian design engineer. As a result of his inventions, in 1910 he was made a Doctor of Engineering at Hannover Technical University. In 1913 he was appointed as department head. Karl G√∂lsdorf was an active member of the German Railway Administrations Union and also brought his expertise to bear as the co-publisher of the paper Eisenbahntechnik der Gegenwart (Railway Technology Today). His collection of photographs earned special fame in connexion with this; it is owned today by the Deutsches Museum. Death Karl G√∂lsdorf died unexpectedly on 18 March 1916 at Wolfsbergkogel whilst staying in Semmering, Austria, of an acute throat infection and not, as incorrectly reported in media at the time, from the consequences of an accident with a locomotive.  Citations  The saying that \\"you can't save a tonne of weight on a locomotive - but you can save a kilo in a thousand places\\" (Man kann an einer Lokomotive nicht eine Tonne Gewicht einsparen - wohl aber an tausend Stellen ein Kilo) is attributed to G√∂lsdorf.  Preservation  Two members of G√∂lsdorf's magnificent 310 class survive in preservation today, one of which is operational. 310.23 is owned and operated by the Strasshoff Railway Museum.

This film is set against the background of the Naxalite movement. Based on a 1980s novel by Samaresh Majumdar, the film sets itself up, quite self-consciously, within a certain tradition of films, namely radical political Bengali cinema of the 1970s and 1980s. It thus establishes an intertextuality and a certain connection with them. By situating itself and the story it has to tell, within this matrix of the 1970s radical Bengali cinema, Ghose anchors the film squarely within that time. The mood and the events certainly, but even the way black and white shots are used, underlines a somewhat documentary ‚Äì and thus temporally limited ‚Äì way these sequences are put to use. Plot Animesh Mitra is simpleton who arrives at Calcutta from Jalpaiguri, during hostile times (1967), to study at the Scottish Church College. He is scheduled to take refuge at the residence of his father‚Äôs friend Mr. Debabrata, but he accidentally gets shot in the limb and ends up at the Calcutta Medical College. Eventually things move on and Animesh develops a deep friendship with Debabrata‚Äôs daughter Neela. He takes admission in the B.A classes of Scottish Church College on Bengali Literature and ultimately becomes intertwined with the unresting times of the youth intellect. Though he tried to keep himself away from politics but, he turns to become a Communist under the mentorship of Ramen and Subash Sen, but after a year he feels that their party (B.P.S.F) has been deviating from the ideals of building up an egalitarian society. With the idealistic ideas of Subhash Sen and others Animesh rediscover himself as a hardcore Naxalite, rampaging the interiors of northern West Bengal. In the meantime Animesh gets ripped up between his ideals and his love (Madhabilata). Earlier, Madhabilata( a friend of Neela) opposed the ideals that Animesh believes, but she promised that she will never become a barrier to his mission. Madhabilata gets pregnant out of wedlock while Animesh abandons her for greater idealism. Animesh‚Äôs roommate, the unquenchable poet Tridip, accompanies him with a dreamy vision of a noncompartmentalized nation. But outrageous planning leads the Naxalite movement to be a tragic demise. Subash Sen and other leaders get slaughtered by the brutal Congressian Police. Tridip is shot dead and the girls who are arrested in charge of spreading the ideals of Naxalism, are raped by the police officers and Animesh is tortured by the state to such an extent that he becomes crippled. His nervous systems (below and from the hips) breaks down completely, making him a man who can sit and stagger. Madhabilata gives birth to a baby boy (Arka). Neela stands beside Madhabilata like a wall and delivers immense support, though her husband refuses to stretch out his helping hand. Finally in 1977, the Left Front Government decides to release every political prisoner; a devastated Animesh comes out from jail custody after meeting minister Sudip (his compatriot during his days at the Calcutta University). The film ends with silver lining when Animesh unites with his estranged family in a slum (wife and son) with nothing to vie for but with a spark of hope against aghast capitalism and return to mainstream with a new ideology.

Louis's answer: \\"I do know nothing of it.\\" # Back in July 1791, the Declaration of Pillnitz was being drafted by Leopold II of Austria (brother of Queen Marie Antoinette) and Frederick William II of Prussia who \\"pledged themselves to re-erect in France the throne of the absolute monarchy, and you were silent on this convention till the moment when it was known by all Europe.\\" Louis's answer: This is my minister's fault. # Louis supported the counter-revolutionary Arles rebellion. Louis's answer: I followed my ministers' advice. # When Avignon and the Comtat Venaissin were annexed to France following a referendum, Louis delayed and sent commissioners that supported its civil war. Louis's answer: I don't remember the delay and the fault lies in the commissioners, not me. # Louis did nothing about the counter-revolutions in N√Æmes, Montauban, and Jal√®s (fr) until Saillant's rebellion. Louis's answer: This was done by my ministers. # Louis sent twenty-two battalions against the people of Marseilles who were marching to subdue the counter-revolutionaries of Arles. Louis's answer: Provide written proof. # Louis received a letter from M. de Wittgenstein, Commandant General of the Army of Southern France (le Midi) asking for additional time to rally support for the throne. Louis's answer: I don't remember the letter and he doesn't work for me anymore. # Louis paid his former bodyguards even after they emigrated out of France to Coblentz along with other noble √©migr√©s. Louis's answer: I stopped paying the bodyguards after they emigrated. As for the nobles, I don't remember. # Louis's two exiled brothers, Louis Stanislas Xavier and Charles Philippe, both future French kings, are accused of raising regiments, borrowing money and contracting alliances to overturn the revolution. A letter signed by the two written to Louis is produced. Louis's answer: I disowned them once I became aware of their proceedings. I know nothing of this letter. # Louis is accused of neglecting the defense of the country by not providing sufficient men, money or arms and refusing the establishment of a camp of 20,000 near Paris. Louis's answer: The fault lies with my ministers. # A letter from Hippolyte- Jean-Ren√© de Toulongeon (fr) is produced that indicates Louis's approval of his emigration to Vienna. This is used as evidence that he encourages desertion to the service of his brothers. Louis's answer: \\"I know nothing of this; there is not a word true in this charge.\\" # A letter from Choiseul- Gouffier, former ambassador to Constantinople, establishes Louis's desire for peace between Turkey and Austria so that Austria could use the Turkish border troops against France. Louis's answer: Choiseul-Gouffier is a liar. # The Prussians were advancing on France but Louis waited until 10 July 1792 to inform the Assembly. Louis's answer: I didn't know until then; my ministers were responsible. # Louis made Charles d'Abancour minister of war, a suspicious choice since he was the nephew of ex-Finance Minister Charles Alexandre de Calonne who had joined the anti-revolution √©migr√© group at Coblenz. It was during D'Abancour's tenue that Longwy and Verdun were lost to the Prussians and √©migr√©s. Louis's answer: I didn't know he was his nephew. # Louis is accused of destroying the French navy with his Secretary of Navy Bertrand de Molleville organizing the mass emigration of officers. When the Assembly accused Molleville, Louis replied he was \\"satisfied with his services.\\" Louis's answer: \\"I have done all that I could to retain the Officers.\\" A lack of proper complaint precluded me from removing him. # Louis is accused of having agents in the French colonies fomenting counter- revolution (see Haitian Revolution). Louis's answer: \\"I had nothing to do with [that].\\" # Louis is protecting fanatical internal enemies of France, aristocrats and \\"non-juring\\" clergy (those who refuse to take the Civil Constitution of the Clergy oath), so that he can restore the Ancien R√©gime. Louis's answer: \\"I know nothing of this project.\\" # On 29 November 1791 the Assembly issued a decree that \\"non-juring\\" priests would no longer receive state funds. Louis vetoed this decree. Louis's answer: The constitution gave me the power to veto. # Anti-revolutionary disturbances from these \\"non- juring\\" clerics increase and Louis's ministers say they are not breaking the law. On 27 May 1792 the Assembly issues a decree allowing for the deportation of the clerics, if twenty \\"active citizens\\" (over the age of 25, paid direct taxes equal to three days' labor) request and the department concurs. Louis, again, vetoes. Louis's answer: The constitution gave me the power to veto. # The reputation of the King's bodyguards was poor, accused of anti- revolutionary sentiments. On 29 May 1792, the Assembly decreed their disbanding. Louis signed, if reluctantly. He is accused of writing the guards \\"a letter of satisfaction\\" and continuing to pay them. Louis's answer: I stopped paying them once new guards were appointed. # Louis kept the Swiss Guards among his bodyguards contrary to the constitution. The Assembly had expressly ordered their departure. Louis's answer: \\"I have executed all the decrees that have been enacted....\\" # Louis Collenot d'Angremont (fr) (first to be guillotined due to his activities on August 10) and a person going by the name of Gilles were counter-revolutionaries in the pay of Louis. Louis's answer: I have no knowledge. \\"The idea of counter-revolution never entered my head.\\" # You tried to bribe, with considerable sums, several members of the Constituent and Legislative Assemblies; letters from Dufresne Saint-L√©on and several others, which will be presented to you, establish this fact. # You allowed the French nation to be disgraced in Germany, in Italy, and in Spain, since you did nothing to exact reparation for the ill treatment which the French experienced in those countries. # On 10 August you reviewed the Swiss Guards at five o‚Äôclock in the morning; and the Swiss Guards fired first on the citizens. # You caused the blood of Frenchmen to flow. = Cross-examination = Louis XVI heard the 33 charges sitting in the armchair in which he had accepted the Constitution. After the secretary had read him the accusation act, Bertrand Bar√®re de Vieuzac repeated each charge and questioned Louis XVI. The defense, 26 December 1792= The defense team = Louis XVI sought the most illustrious legal minds in France as his defense team. He first asked Gui-Jean-Baptiste Target, former deputy of the National Constituent Assembly and hero of the Parlements of the ancien r√©gime, to lead his defense, but the elderly lawyer refused on account of his age. The task of lead counsel fell to Raymond Des√®ze, who was assisted by Fran√ßois Denis Tronchet (Target's closest colleague, who came on board reluctantly, only at the King's insistence) and Guillaume-Chr√©tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes (Louis XVI's former Secretary of State). Though he had only two weeks to prepare his defense arguments. Des√®ze's brilliance so shone through in a first draft that, although it was moving, Louis rejected it as too rhetorical, saying, \\"I do not want to play on their (the Convention's) feelings\\". When the time came to deliver the defense (26 December 1792), despite having had no sleep for over four days, he pleaded the king's case for three hours, arguing eloquently yet discreetly that the revolution spare his life. Beginning with a description of why the charges were invalid (under the terms of the Constitution of 1791 Louis, as king, was immune from prosecution), he attacked the right of National Convention to stand as judge and jury. Finally, he moved to a rejection of the charges in the acte enonciatif drawn up by the constitution charge by charge, with a royalist history of the revolution, portraying Louis as \\"the restorer of French Liberty\\". He finished, like many of the set-piece speeches of the revolution, with an appeal to history: = Declaration of Louis XVI in his defense. = \\"You have heard my defense, I would not repeat the details. In talking to you perhaps for the last time, I declare that my conscience reproaches me with nothing, and my defenders have told you the truth. I never feared the public examination of my conduct, but my heart is torn by the imputation that I would want to shed the blood of the people and especially that the misfortunes of August 10th be attributed to me. I avow that the many proofs that I have always acted from my love of the people, and the manner in which I have always conducted myself, seemed to prove that I did not fear to put myself forward in order to spare their blood, and forever prevent such an imputation.\\" The verdict, 14‚Äì15 January Given overwhelming evidence of Louis' collusion with the invaders, the verdict was a foregone conclusion. Ultimately, 693 deputies voted to convict the former king. Not a single deputy voted \\"no,\\" though 26 attached some condition to their votes. Twenty-six deputies were absent from the vote, most on official business. Twenty-three deputies abstained, for various reasons. Several abstained because they felt they had been elected to make laws rather than to judge. The punishment, 16‚Äì17 January=The Mailhe amendment= For the king's sentence, deputy Jean-Baptiste Mailhe proposed \\"Death, but [...] I think it would be worthy of the Convention to consider whether it would be useful to policy to delay the execution\\" which was supported by twenty-six deputies. This \\"Mailhe amendment\\" was regarded by some of Mailhe's contemporaries as a conspiracy to save the king's life. It was even suggested that Mailhe had been paid, perhaps by Spanish gold. =The vote= Paris voted overwhelmingly for death, 21 to 3. Robespierre voted first, and said \\"The sentiment that led me to call for the abolition of the death penalty is the same that today forces me to demand that it be applied to the tyrant of my country.\\" Philippe √âgalit√©, formerly the Duke of Orl√©ans and Louis' own cousin, voted for his execution, a cause of much future bitterness among French monarchists. There were 721 voters in total. 34 voted for death with attached conditions (23 of whom invoked the Mailhe amendment), 2 voted for life imprisonment in irons, 319 voted for imprisonment until the end of the war (to be followed by banishment). 361 voted for death without conditions, just carrying the vote by a marginal majority. Louis was to be put to death. A subsequent vote, on the proposal that the sentence be respited, saw a vote of 380-286 in favour of immediate execution. =Execution= Louis was guillotined on 21 January 1793 in the Place de la R√©volution (renamed Place de la Concorde in 1795).

Plot summary The main character is an old woman, Roseanne McNulty, who now resides in the Roscommon Regional Mental Hospital. Having been a patient for some fifty years or more, Roseanne decides to write an autobiography. She calls it \\"Roseanne's testimony of herself\\" and charts her life and that of her parents, living in Sligo at the turn of the 20th Century. She keeps her story hidden under the loose floorboard in her room, unsure as yet if she wants it to be found. The second narrative is the \\"commonplace book\\" of the current chief Psychiatrist of the hospital, Dr Grene. The hospital now faces imminent demolition. He must decide who of his patients are to be transferred, and who must be released into the community. He is particularly concerned about Roseanne, and begins tentatively to attempt to discover her history. It soon becomes apparent that both Roseanne and Dr Grene have differing stories as to her incarceration and her early life, but what is consistent in both narratives is that Roseanne fell victim to the religious and political upheavals in Ireland in the 1920s ‚Äì 1930s. Inspiration The novel was inspired by a story told to him by his mother of an old relative: The story also ties in with previous novels by Barry, especially The Whereabouts of Eneas Mcnulty, the title character being a brother in law to Roseanne McNulty. Awards It won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, one of the most prestigious English literature prizes and the oldest prize in the United Kingdom. The novel won the Book of the Year at the 2008 Costa Awards,. This was despite the misgivings of the jury, one of whom, Matthew Parris said \\"They agreed that it was flawed, and almost no one liked the ending, which was almost fatal to its success\\" At the Irish Book Awards, it won \\"Novel of the Year\\" and the Choice Award. It was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for Fiction, narrowly losing to The White Tiger Book at Bedtime adaptation In May 2008, the novel was adapted and abridged by Neville Teller for BBC Radio 4's Book at Bedtime with Doreen Keogh and Alex Jennings voicing the roles of Roseanne and Dr. Grene, respectively.

Built in 1969, it is located close to the Dhauladhar mountain range. The school is a unit of the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, which has branches in five continents. History The school's two main buildings The school is a co-educational institution open to students irrespective of caste, colour, creed and religion. The Indo-Pakistan war of 1965 affected the administrative set up of the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary in India. The then Provincial mother Declan was contemplating opening new avenues for apostolic activities. At that time some military officials contacted Mother Declan, asking for sisters to take over the Garrison school, a small primary school at Yol military camp in Himachal Pradesh. A military bungalow was given to the sisters as residence and several similar bungalows nearby to be used for the school, which was then run by an elderly lady. On 26 August 1966, five sisters arrived in Yol (Srs. Giovanni, Vincentia, Susan, Nirmala and Justina). In November 1966 the community was officially established with Sr. Corneliave as its first superior and Srs. Vincentia, Susan, Silvia, and Lucia as founding members. By January 1967 the Primary Garrison School with 150 students was taken over by the sisters and it was rechristened \\"Sacred Heart Garrison School\\". It was a co-educational school with the arrival of the 4th Mountain Division of the army under the commands of Major General Rai, the number of students increased, the bungalows could not accommodate them. So more classrooms were needed. After searching a new location between Dharamsala and Yol, in Sidhpur, was found. The new school building consisted of eight class rooms and all the facilities for the boarding school. The classes started in Sidhpur in 1969. The convent in Sidhpur was built later. The first prize distribution function was held at the school in Yol on 5 December 1969. Shri Choudhary Hari Ram, the then Transport minister of Himachal Pradesh was Chief Guest. In March 1970, the late Dr. Y.S. Parmar, the then Chief minister of H.P. formally inaugurated Sacred Heart High School, Sidhpur with classes Primary to I.S.C (+2). The boarding house was closed in 1985. Initially started as a purely girls school, it became co- educational in the early seventies on the request of the locals, as it was the only convent.  Inter-school achievements (2015)  The school had achieved the first position in the model presentation at the Central University of Himachal Pradesh, Shahpur on the Earth Day, on 22 April 2015. The model presented was an earthquake-resistant structure inspired by the Shinbashira concept used in the Japanese Pagoda Temples.

The execution of Louis XVI by guillotine, a major event of the French Revolution, took place on 21 January 1793 at the Place de la R√©volution (\\"Revolution Square\\", formerly Place Louis XV, and renamed Place de la Concorde in 1795) in Paris. At a trial on 17 January 1793, the National Convention had convicted the king of high treason in a near-unanimous vote; while no one voted \\"not guilty\\", several deputies abstained. Ultimately, they condemned him to death by a simple majority. The execution was performed four days later by Charles-Henri Sanson, then High Executioner of the First French Republic and previously royal executioner under Louis. Often viewed as a turning point in both French and European history, Louis' death inspired various reactions around the world. To some, his death at the hands of his former subjects symbolised the long-awaited end of an unbroken thousand-year period of absolute monarchy in France and the true beginning of democracy within the nation, although Louis would not be the last king of France. Others (even some who had supported major political reform) condemned the execution as an act of senseless bloodshed and saw it as a sign that France had devolved into a state of violent, amoral chaos. Louis' death emboldened revolutionaries within France, who would continue to alter the country's political and social structure radically over the next several years. Nine months after Louis' death, his wife Marie Antoinette, herself the former queen of France met her own death at the guillotine at the same location in Paris.  Journey from the Temple prison to the Place de la R√©volution  Louis XVI awoke at 5 o'clock. After dressing with the aid of his valet Jean-Baptiste Cl√©ry, he went to meet with the non-juring Irish priest Henry Essex Edgeworth to make his confession. He heard his last Mass, served by Cl√©ry, and received Communion. The Mass requisites were provided by special direction of the authorities. On Father Edgeworth's advice, Louis avoided a last farewell scene with his family. At 7 o'clock he confided his last wishes to the priest. His royal seal was to go to the Dauphin and his wedding ring to the Queen. After receiving the priest's blessing, he went to meet Antoine Joseph Santerre, Commander of the Guard. A green carriage waited in the second court. He seated himself in it with the priest, with two militiamen sitting opposite them. The carriage left the Temple at approximately 9 o'clock. For more than an hour the carriage, preceded by drummers playing to drown out any support for the King and escorted by a cavalry troop with drawn sabres, made its way through Paris along a route lined with 80,000 men-at-arms (soldiers of the National Guard and sans-culottes). In the neighbourhood of the present-day rue de Cl√©ry, the Baron de Batz, a supporter of the Royal family who had financed the flight to Varennes, had summoned 300 Royalists to enable the King's escape. Louis was to be hidden in a house in the rue de Cl√©ry belonging to the Count of Marsan. The Baron leaped forward calling \\"Follow me, my friends, let us save the King!\\", but his associates had been denounced and only a few had been able to turn up. Three of them were killed, but de Batz managed to escape. At 10 o'clock, the carriage arrived at Place de la R√©volution and proceeded to an area where a scaffold had been erected, in a space surrounded by guns and drums, and by a crowd carrying pikes and bayonets. Execution After initially refusing to permit Sanson and his assistants to bind his hands together, Louis XVI relented when Sanson proposed to use his handkerchief instead of rope. The executioner's men cut his hair, removed his shirt's collar, and followed him up the scaffold. Upon the platform, Louis proclaimed his innocence to the crowd and expressed his concern for the future of France. He tried to give an extensive speech, but a drumroll was ordered and the resulting noise made his final words difficult to understand. The executioners fastened him to the guillotine's bench (bascule), positioning his neck beneath the device's yoke (lunette) to hold it in place, and the blade swiftly decapitated him. Sanson grabbed his severed head out of the receptacle into which it fell and exhibited it to the cheering crowd. According to one witness report, the blade did not sever his neck but instead cut through the back of his skull and into his jaw.Stephen Clarke, The French Revolution & what went wrong, Century, 2018, p.452, . Some accounts state that members of the crowd rushed towards the scaffold with handkerchiefs to dip them in his blood to keep as souvenirs. According to another account, it took two times to slice off his head from his neck (due to the fact the king was fat in weight), and he screamed out of pain before the second time successfully decapitated him. Witness quotes \\"The Death of Louis XVI King of France from an English engraving, published 1798. =Henry Essex Edgeworth= Edgeworth, Louis' Irish confessor, wrote in his memoirs: = Press of the day = The 13 February issue of the Thermom√®tre du jour ('Daily Thermometer'), a moderate Republican newspaper, described the King as shouting \\"I am lost!\\", citing as its source the executioner, Charles-Henri Sanson. = Charles-Henri Sanson = Charles-Henri Sanson responded to the story by offering his own version of events in a letter dated 20 February 1793. The account of Sanson states: In his letter, published along with its French mistakes in the Thermom√®tre of Thursday, 21 February 1793, Sanson emphasises that the King \\"bore all this with a composure and a firmness which has surprised us all. I remained strongly convinced that he derived this firmness from the principles of the religion by which he seemed penetrated and persuaded as no other man.\\" = Henri Sanson = \\"Execution of Louis XVI\\" ‚Äì German copperplate engraving, 1793, by Georg Heinrich Sieveking In his Causeries, Alexandre Dumas refers to a meeting circa 1830 with Henri Sanson, eldest son of Charles-Henri Sanson, who had also been present at the execution. Henri Sanson was appointed Executioner of Paris from April 1793, and would later execute Marie Antoinette. =Leboucher= Speaking to Victor Hugo in 1840, a man called Leboucher, who had arrived in Paris from Bourges in December 1792 and was present at the execution of Louis XVI, recalled vividly: =Louis-S√©bastien Mercier= In Le nouveau Paris, Mercier describes the execution of Louis XVI in these words:  Jacques de Molay  A popular but apocryphal legend holds that as soon as the guillotine fell, an anonymous Freemason leaped on the scaffolding, plunged his hand into the blood, splashed drips of it onto the crown, and shouted, \\"Jacques de Molay, tu es veng√©!\\" (usually translated as, \\"Jacques de Molay, thou art avenged\\"). De Molay (died 1314), the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, had reportedly cursed Louis' ancestor Philip the Fair, after the latter had sentenced him to burn at the stake based on false confessions. The story spread widely and the phrase remains in use today to indicate the triumph of reason and logic over \\"religious superstition\\".  Burial in the cemetery of the Madeleine  The body of Louis XVI was immediately transported to the old Church of the Madeleine (demolished in 1799), since the legislation in force forbade burial of his remains beside those of his father, the Dauphin Louis de France, at Sens. Two curates who had sworn fealty to the Revolution held a short memorial service at the church. One of them, Damoureau, stated in evidence: On 21 January 1815 Louis XVI and his wife's remains were re-buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis where in 1816 his brother, King Louis XVIII, had a funerary monument erected by Edme Gaulle.  Today  The area where Louis XVI and later (16 October 1793) Marie Antoinette were buried, in the churchyard of St. Mary Magdaleine's, is today the \\"Square Louis XVI\\" greenspace, containing the classically self-effacing Expiatory Chapel completed in 1826 during the reign of Louis's youngest brother Charles X. The crypt altar stands above the exact spot where the remains of the Royal couple were originally laid to rest. The chapel narrowly escaped destruction on politico-ideological grounds during the violently anti-clerical period at the beginning of the 20th century.

Background Parliament drew up 27 articles in November 1644 and presented them to Charles I of England at Oxford. Much input into these Propositions of Uxbridge was from Archibald Johnston. The conditions were very assertive, with Presbyterianism to be established south of the border, and Parliament to take control of all military matters. Charles had decided that the military situation was turning in his favour, after the Second Battle of Lostwithiel, Second Battle of Newbury and consequent relief of Donnington Castle, and the campaign of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose in Scotland. Montrose's victory at the Battle of Inverlochy was during the conference. His incentive to compromise was thereby reduced, but the same was true of the Parliamentary side, with its growing confidence in the New Model Army.Stephen C. Manganiello, The Concise Encyclopedia of the Revolutions and Wars of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1639-1660 (2004), p. 550. Proposals Samuel Rawson Gardiner (1829‚Äì1902) summarized Parliament's demands (formatting added): > # exclusion from seats in the House of Lords of Peers created [after May > 1642] unless with the consent of Parliament (¬ß 19) # permanent submission of > appointments of officers and judges to the approbation of Parliament (¬ß 20) > # education and marriage of the King's children being placed under > Parliamentary control (¬ß 21) # the right of declaring peace and war might > only be exercised with the assent of Parliament (¬ß 23) # a permanent body of > Commissioners ... in combination with ...

[i.e., religious tolerance (for > Protestants)] The King's offer afforded at least an admirable basis for > negotiation. Proceedings The two sides lodged in Uxbridge, the Royalists on the south side and the Parliamentarians in the north. Christopher Love preached a sermon, strongly against the Royalists, and he was rebuked by Parliament. The meetings were arranged in the house of Sir John Bennet. The negotiations, which proved fruitless, went on from 29 January to 22 February. The King offered only to rein in the powers of the episcopate in religious matters, and to give Parliament some control of the militia, limited to a time period of three years.

Views Their works over nearly 30 years write that the king was never governed by his wife. His education was intellectually very complete. He had several lines which he followed throughout his reign, such as preventing civil war and anything that might trigger it. He was never governed by his ministers, and during the French Revolution he pursued a consistent policy, playing the game that had been forced on him. Marie-Antoinette's policy during this period was followed without his knowledge. The letters requesting help from foreign sovereigns and presented as from him were fakes from the queen, and his entourage and the armoire de fer was a pure invention of certain revolutionaries.

English Literature: From the Age of Johnson to the Age of Tennyson. Heinemann, MCMIII. The poem was well received, but not a financial success for its author. The setting of the poem is the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania and the massacre that occurred there on July 3, 1778. On that day, more than three hundred American Revolutionaries died at the hands of Loyalists and their Iroquois allies. At the time, it was widely believed that the attack was led by Joseph Brant; in the poem, Brant is described as the \\"Monster Brant\\" because of the atrocities committed, although it was later determined that Brant had not actually been present. The poem has been criticized for other historical inaccuracies. The poem begins: :On Susquehanna's side, fair Wyoming! :Although the wild-flower on thy ruin'd wall, :And roofless homes, a sad remembrance bring, :Of what thy gentle people did befall; :Yet thou wert once the loveliest land of all :That see the Atlantic wave their morn restore. :Sweet land! may I thy lost delights recall, :And paint thy Gertrude in her bowers of yore, :Whose beauty was the love of Pennsylvania's shore! The popularity of the poem may have led to the state of Wyoming being named after the valley, and Wyoming, a suburb north of Gosford, New South Wales, Australia is said to have been given its name by Frederick Augustus Hely because Gertrude of Wyoming was his favourite poem.

He won the second prize for sculpture in 1791 with Pericles coming to visit Anaxagoras, and the first prize for sculpture (Prix de Rome) in 1803 for Ulysses recognising his nurse Eurycleia, but the Napoleonic Wars prevented him setting out for Rome for his stay at the Villa Medici. He and Fran√ßois Rude were two of the thirty sculptors charged with the sculpture of the colonne de la Grande Arm√©e on place Vend√¥me in Paris. He was an expert consultant on the restoration of the bas-relief of the pediment of the Panth√©on de Paris, realised by David d'Angers in 1830. This pediment was originally sculpted by his master Moitte in 1793 and was practically destroyed in 1822, with Edme Gaulle succeeding in conserving the fragments that were left.

Route=Northern Cape= The western terminus of the N14 begins in Voortrekker Street, Springbok, at an intersection with the R355, just next to its N7 off-ramp. It leaves the town towards the east, crossing under the N7 and then heads north-east past Carolusberg and through the Goegap Nature Reserve. After a considerable distance, it enters Pofadder from the west, intersecting the north/south R358 in the town centre. It leaves eastwards, then turns to the north-east towards Kakamas, entering the town from the west. It's intersected by the R359 in the town before leaving to the north, crossing the Orange River and then heading east until it intersects with the R27 in Keimoes. The N14 heads north out of the town. It continues north-east, following the Orange River, to Upington. In the town centre, it intersects with the N10 before continuing north-east to Olifantshoek and Kuruman, meeting the R385 and R325 routes. It passes through Kuruman as its main road, intersecting the R31. It leaves north-east and crosses into the North West province. =North West= Crossing into the province, the route is intersected at t-junction by the R371. The N14 continues east-north-east and enters Vryburg from the south-west, becoming the town's main road through the centre (Market Street) and crossing the N18 before leaving Vryburg to the east. Just outside the town, the road continues south-east cosigned with the R34 before the N14 turns north-east to Delareyville. Just outside the town, the R377 intersects from the left, while the N14 enters the town from the west. Briefly cosigned with the R507 it heads north through the town as its main road (Generaal Delarey Street). Leaving north-east, it passes the Barberspan Dam and nature reserve before passing through Roosville as its main road. The route goes north-east to Biesiesvlei, where the road meets the R52 before the N14 turns east, reaching the R505 as a t-junction. Briefly cosigned it turns right then left leaving the R505 continuing east and north-east to Coligny. Here it cosigns with the R503 and is the ring-road to the south of the town and then heads eastwards to Ventersdorp. The route bypasses the town to the south first crossing R30, the main road to the town and then the R53, as it leaves heading east again. Shortly after the village of Klerkskraal, it enters Gauteng province. =Gauteng= The N14 enters the province heading north-east, crossing the R500 and R41 near the village of Holfontein. It continues north-east, later crossing the R24 south of the Tarlton International Raceway and north of the Krugersdorp Game Reserve, and then skirts the latter to its north. It bypasses north of the Krugersdorp CBD, intersecting the R563 and R540. At the major intersection at Cradlestone Mall, Krugersdorp, it meets the R28 that heads south-west to the town centre and the M47 Hendrik Potgieter Road that heads south-east to Roodepoort. The N14 turns north-east at this junction, passing through Muldersdrift and crossing the R114. Shortly after Muldersdrift, there is major interchange with the M5 Beyers Naude Drive to Johannesburg. The next interchange follows shortly where the R512 Malibongwe Drive crosses over it. Continuing north-east it crosses the Jukskei River and later interchanges the R114 again and R511/R562 at Diepsloot West. It soon takes an easterly direction, interchanging the R55 at Olievenhoutbosch, Centurion and shortly thereafter it meets the Brakfontein Interchange with the N1 Ben Schoeman Freeway in the southern suburbs of Centurion. The N14 and N1 switch highways, with the N1 now becoming the eastwards highway and the N14 now becoming the Ben Schoeman Freeway northwards. It intersects the M34 (Jean Avenue) at Die Hoewes and the M10/M24 near Lyttelton Manor. The next major interchange is with the M7 west and M18 at the Groenkloof Nature Reserve near Fountains Valley. Shortly thereafter it joins the R101 northwards and ends in the southern suburb of Salvokop, Pretoria, marking its eastern terminus. History The N14 is the only National Route in Gauteng that was not upgraded in 2010 and is the only National Route within Gauteng without a tolling system on its roads. In 2015 - 2017 the Highway was upgraded and re-tarred from Krugersdorp to Diepsloot. In 2017 - 2019 the remaining section will be upgraded to the Brakfontein Interchange upgrading the N14 from 2x2 to 2x3. The upgrades are done by the Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) and the route remains toll-free.

It passes through Springs, Bethal and Ermelo. The section of the N17 from Johannesburg to Springs is a dual carriageway and is a national toll route. It was the first urban toll road in Gauteng. It runs from the M11 Wemmer Pan Road in Johannesburg to Tonk Meter Road in Springs. The first part of the N17 used to be the old R77 which ran from the M46 Rand Airport Road to the R23. As part of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Scheme, two slip roads have been made linking the N17 to the N12. It is now possible to travel from the N17 West to the N12 West and from the N12 East to the N17 East, both at the Elands Interchange (previously only possible via the N3). From Tonk Meter Road the N17 is a single carriageway freeway. The section from Springs to Leandra, ending at the interchange with the R50, was constructed by the then Transvaal Provincial Administration (TPA) in 1990 as a single carriageway road. (The R29 ran alongside the N17 from Springs to Leandra). From Leandra, the N17 then followed the alignment of the R29 to Ermelo, and thereafter the R65 to Oshoek. However, the N17 at that time traversed through four towns (Leandra, Kinross, Trichardt and Bethal) causing delays to the traveling public, and safety risks to the local public, especially pedestrians. The R29 was also badly potholed, and without passing lanes or even shoulders, making the section from Leandra to Ermelo dangerous. SANRAL commenced with toll feasibility investigations in 2001 for the N17 after which consultants were appointed for the rehabilitation, upgrading as well as design of new sections for the N17 from Springs to Ermelo. In order to enable SANRAL to refund loans for the funding of the rehabilitation project, it was inevitable that the N17 from Springs to Oshoek in the Mpumalanga Province would also be declared a continuous toll road and toll plazas will be erected. The existing single lane carriageway between Springs and Leandra has been rehabilitated with improvements to the vertical and horizontal alignment, paved shoulders, grade separated interchanges at the R548 (Devon/Balfour) and R42 (Delmas/Nigel), and climbing/passing lanes. The new section between Leandra and Trichardt (21 km) has been completed, and the first toll plaza at the interchange with the R50 is now open. As of October 2011, the N17 rejoins the old alignment just east of Kinross. Other improvements will include a new section past Trichardt (3 km) and in Bethal (1,5 km). The N17 East Toll Road comprises Section 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the proclaimed N17 route. In general terms the route can be described as the existing N17 between Springs and Oshoek, with approximately 26 km of newly constructed sections. The total length of the route is 290 km. (330 km with section 1 included) Route=Gauteng= The N17 begins in the southern suburbs of Johannesburg, north of Rosettenville, at a t-junction with Wemmer Pan Road (Johannesburg's M11 Road), heading eastwards. It continues eastwards for ten kilometres (with two westbound-only off-ramps at the M19 and M31 Roads), passing under the N12 Highway (Johannesburg Ring Road), to form an interchange with the N3 Highway just south of Rand Airport. As part of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project, there are now two slip roads; one linking the N17 West to the N12 West and one linking the N12 East to the N17 East (previously only possible via the N3 freeway). Just after the N3 interchange is the Gosforth Toll Plaza (the first N17 toll plaza). From the N3 Interchange, the N17 goes eastwards through the City of Ekurhuleni for thirty kilometres, bypassing Germiston, Boksburg, Benoni and Brakpan, to Springs, where there are off-ramp junctions with Tonk Meter Road (M63 Road) and Nigel-Springs Road (R51 road). This marks the end of section 1 of the proclaimed N17 route. On this section, at the R23 junction in the suburb of Dalpark in Brakpan, is a tollgate (Dalpark Toll Plaza). The N17 National Route continues for 50 kilometres eastwards from the Springs Junction, bypassing Devon (the last town of the Gauteng Province), to reach the town of Leandra, which is the first town in the Mpumalanga Province. This marks the end of section 2 of the proclaimed N17 route. From Johannesburg, the N17 is followed by the R29 Road (parallel from Springs). This road may be used as an alternative in times when the N17 Section 2 is experiencing issues. =Mpumalanga= In Leandra, the N17 reaches an intersection with the R50 road, which is the end of section 2. On the eastern side of the junction, there is a tollgate. (Tollgates are also found on the off-ramps coming from and going towards the west) The N17 used to form a Z-shape in Leandra, being concurrent with the R50 from this junction north- westwards for 3 kilometers up to the junction with the R29, where the N17 would continue eastwards. But Today, the N17 is a continuous highway from its primary junction with the R50. (Avoiding the Leandra Town Centre and the upcoming Kinross Town Centre by bypassing to the south) So, as the R29 used to end at the junction with the R50, it now also continues eastwards on that old section of the N17 route through Leandra Central and Kinross Central, remaining an alternative route to the current N17. From the R50 junction, the N17 continues eastwards for twenty kilometres, bypassing Kinross, to meet the R580 road at a point north-east of Evander and north-west of Secunda, which marks the point where the N17 joins its old alignment. This junction, known as the Leven Station Junction, also marks the eastern end of the R29 route (the N17 Highway no longer has a parallel, backup route following it for the remainder of its length). From the R29/R580 junction, the N17 continues eastwards for another ten kilometres to reach the town of Trichardt. As the N17 used to pass through the Trichardt town centre, it has now been realigned to bypass it to the north, remaining one continuous highway. Just after Trichardt is a tollgate. From Trichardt, the N17 continues eastwards for 25 kilometres to reach the town of Bethal, which marks the end of section 3 of the proclaimed N17 route. Plans are underway to find a route for construction in order for traffic to skip the town centre. North of Bethal town centre, the N17 meets the R35 and R38 routes and they become one road through the town centre. East of Bethal Hospital, the R38 becomes its own road south-west and in the southern suburbs, the R35 becomes its own road southwards. From the R35 split in Bethal, the N17 goes eastwards for fifty kilometres to the city of Ermelo, which marks the end of section 4 of the proclaimed N17 route. Before Ermelo, there is a tollgate. Plans are underway to find a route for construction in order for traffic to skip the town centre. In Ermelo Central, the N17 enters as Joubert Street and reaches an intersection with the N11 national route (Kerk Street), just one kilometre north of its intersection with the N2 national route terminus. The N17 joins the N11 northwards up to the junction with Fourie Street, where the N17 turns eastwards. The route continues towards the north-east. At the junction with the R36 road 7 kilometres from Ermelo Central, the N17 continues by way of a right turn. 3 kilometers before the town of Warburton, the N11 is joined by the R33 route eastwards and they are one road, bypassing Warburton, for 10 kilometers before the R33 becomes its own road southwards. The N17 continues eastwards to reach the Oshoek border post with Eswatini, marking its end. It becomes the MR3 road on the other side and proceeds through Ngwenya to the city of Mbabane (Eswatini's Capital City). The 5th and last section of the proclaimed N17 route, from Ermelo through Chrissiesmeer, Warburton and Hartebeeskop to Oshoek is 123 kilometers. The total distance of the N17 National Route from Johannesburg is 330 Kilometres. (290 kilometers from Springs) Proposed Extension It is often forgotten that the N17 (Section 1) is intended to continue west from its present terminus with the M11 at Wemmer Pan Road, Johannesburg to Krugersdorp. This would make it the much needed second link between the East and West Rand (presently the link is via the N12/N3/M2 and Main Reef Road R41 Or Albertina Sisulu Road R24). As part of the infrastructure built for the Soccer World Cup in 2010, a small portion of the N17, Section 1 has been built, including an interchange with the N1 Highway (Johannesburg Western Bypass) (north off-ramp and south on-ramp only). However, the N17 remains a dual carriageway road, and not freeway for this section. It runs for approximately 8km from the M5 Baragwanath Road (Nasrec Road) north of FNB Stadium and then sharply veers off its alignment to end at the northern end of Klipsruit Road north of Soweto. Even though this short stretch of road is labelled as the N17 to the near public, there are no plans to build the remainder of the N17 in either direction. Improvements in detail=Improvements to the section between Springs and Leandra (48km)= SANRAL constructed interchanges at the Nigel and Devon intersections to address high accident rates. In addition, passing and climbing lanes were constructed. =New section between Leandra and Leven Station (21km)= This is a completely new section.

The names of Nathanael and Beckhardt were removed from the list of recipients during the Nazi era. He was twice personally congratulated by the German Emperor Wilhelm II for his successes as a fighter pilot. Between the wars In 1926, Beckhardt married Rosa Emma Neumann in Wiesbaden, Germany. He then ran his father-in-law's grocery store until 1934. When the Nazis began their boycott of Jewish businesses on 1 April 1933, he moved from the suburb of Sonnenberg, where he had been doing business, to the center of Wiesbaden. There he had a business that specialized in edible oils and fats. In 1936 he drove two Jewish brothers named Frohwein to the Belgian border so they could flee the Gestapo. The Frohweins later opened a kosher butchery in Golders Green, London. In 1937 Beckhardt was accused of having sexual relations with a non-Jewish \\"Aryan\\" woman. As a result of the trial on 14 December 1937, he was convicted and sent to prison for a year and nine months. After his time in prison he was taken in protective custody to a penal company in Buchenwald concentration camp as prisoner no. 8135.

He is a former defensive coordinator for the University of North Carolina Tar Heels football team and for the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers. Biography=Early life and education= John Papuchis was born in Gaithersburg, Maryland. He graduated from Quince Orchard High School in 1996, where he was a three-sport athlete, including three years on the Varsity baseball team where he earned All-Montgomery County honors as a junior and senior. He also was the starting quarterback his senior year on the QO football team. Papuchis received a Business Management Bachelor's degree from Virginia Tech in 2001, followed by a Sports Administration Master's degree from the University of Kansas in 2003.University of Nebraska Coach Profile: John Papuchis Coaching career=Early years= Papuchis' coaching career began at the high school level while he was still in college. While attending Virginia Tech, Papuchis joined the staff at Blacksburg High where he also helped coach the junior varsity basketball program. Following his graduation from Virginia Tech in 2001, Papuchis began his college coaching career at the University of Kansas under Head Coach Terry Allen as a Graduate Assistant, working with the Kansas Jayhawks defensive unit, while continuing his studies towards his master's degree. In his final year at Kansas, he helped the Jayhawks reach the 2003 Tangerine Bowl, which ended Kansas' seven-year drought of bowl appearances. =LSU= In 2004, Papuchis accepted a similar position at Louisiana State University, as a Defensive Intern and Graduate Assistant under Head Coach Nick Saban, with additional duties coaching the punters. The following year, with Les Miles taking over for the departed Nick Saban, Bo Pelini joined LSU as Defensive Coordinator. Papuchis remained on the LSU staff under Pelini, and the LSU defense helped the Tigers to a final #6 ranking in both major polls. 2006 saw further improvement, as the LSU defensive unit finished in the top ten nationally in four major defensive categories, and a final #3 ranking on both polls. 2007 was a pinnacle year for LSU as the defense helped the Tigers to win the 2008 BCS National Championship Game. In all, the Pelini years at LSU resulted in the Tigers defense being ranked third nationally from 2005-2007. =Nebraska= Just prior to LSU's 2007 season national championship, Pelini was hired as the new Head Coach for the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers football team. Pelini stayed on at LSU through the championship game with the permission of Nebraska's Athletic Director, Tom Osborne, and then took several of his defensive staff members with him to Nebraska, including Papuchis. The 2008 season saw a dramatic turnaround in Nebraska's fortunes, particularly on the defensive side of the ball, as Nebraska climbed from the bottom ten defensive teams nationally and a dismal 5-7 record, to a resurgence of the Nebraska Blackshirt tradition as a surprisingly stingy Nebraska defense helped the Cornhuskers to a 9-4 2008 season, a tie for the Big 12 Conference northern division championship, and a post-January 1 bowl victory against Clemson at the 2009 Gator Bowl. Papuchis enters his fifth season on Bo Pelini's Nebraska staff in 2012, and his first year as the Huskers' defensive coordinator. Papuchis was promoted to his current role in December before Nebraska's Capital One Bowl matchup with South Carolina. In his first four years on staff, Papuchis tutored the defensive line and served as special teams coordinator, and also filled the role of recruiting coordinator in 2011. NU's defensive line had to overcome numerous injuries in 2011, but the unit persevered, combining for 226 tackles, 14.5 sacks and 26 tackles for loss. Two defensive linemen - Cameron Meredith and Terrence Moore - also intercepted passes in 2011, while Meredith earned honorable-mention All-Big Ten honors along with Baker Steinkuhler. Meredith was second on the team with 5.0 sacks and ranked third with six TFLs, nearly doubling his career sack total entering the year. In his third season at Nebraska in 2010, Papuchis was one of four finalists for the FootballScoop Special Teams Coordinator of the Year Award, and continued to play a key role in a dominant defensive line. Both of Nebraska's starting defensive ends earned All-Big 12 accolades in 2010, with senior Pierre Allen claiming first- team honors and sophomore Cameron Meredith garnering second-team accolades. Each player ranked in the top six on the team in tackles while combining for 129 stops, 19 tackles for loss and 5.0 sacks. Defensive tackle Jared Crick was a first-team All-Big 12 pick for the second straight season. In 2009, his defensive ends combined for 127 tackles, including 33 tackles for loss and 12 sacks. With 16 tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks, Barry Turner was an honorable- mention All-Big 12 selection in 2009, while Allen racked up five sacks and 12 tackles for loss. In his first year in Lincoln, Papuchis saw starting defensive ends Zach Potter and Allen combine for 26 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks in 2008, with Potter earning honorable-mention All-Big 12 accolades. The defensive ends helped a Nebraska defense that finished second in the Big 12 in total defense. Nebraska has also owned one of the nation's top special teams units the past three seasons under Papuchis. In 2009, the Huskers‚Äô kickoff and punt return units both ranked in the top 30 nationally, while All-Big 12 punter and place-kicker Alex Henery had an NU record 24 field goals, while also placing a Big 12-leading 30 punts inside the opponent 20-yard line. The Huskers also ranked in the top 15 nationally in kickoff return defense and third in touchbacks. Henery ended his career as Nebraska's all-time leading scorer and was the most accurate kicker in NCAA history, establishing eight NCAA records. Henery was selected as a first-team All-American in 2010, and finished his career hitting 68-of-76 field goal attempts. Along with Henery, Papuchis had another weapon to utilize on special teams in Adi Kunalic. One of the nation's elite kickoff specialists the past three years, Kunalic ranked among the national leaders in touchbacks each season, posting 86 career touchbacks. The special teams unit also had a banner year under Papuchis in 2008, headlined by Henery's school-record 57-yard game-winning field goal against Colorado. Henery finished the year 18-of-21 on field goals and missed just one extra point. Henery was a second-team All-Big 12 pick. The Huskers also ranked in the top 25 nationally in punt returns, and returned both a kickoff and punt for a touchdown in the same season for the first time since 1998. In 2011, Papuchis assumed the additional role as Nebraska's Recruiting Coordinator. Following the departure of Defensive Coordinator Carl Pelini, who was hired to take over head coaching duties at Florida Atlantic at the conclusion of the 2011 season, Papuchis was promoted to fill Nebraska's Defensive Coordinator position. =North Carolina= On February 2, 2015, it was announced that Papuchis had accepted a position with the University of North Carolina as the team's linebacker coach. On February 9, 2017, he was named defensive coordinator following the departure of Gene Chizik.http://www.omaha.com/huskers/football/former-husker-defensive- coordinator-john-papuchis-named-north-carolina- dc/article_b5c66436-ef25-11e6-b446-a7d2acb873ab.html He was let go the same day that Larry Fedora was fired, November 25, 2018. =Maryland= In January 2019, Papuchis was hired as the special teams coordinator and inside linebackers coach with the Maryland Terrapins.

Prokop Reme≈° in the Czech Republic is treating addicts in Bohnice Psychiatric Hospital in Prague. His style of hagiotherapy is a type of group existential psychotherapy (Yalom, Frankl), which focuses on eliminating dysfunctional behaviour patterns from one's life. This hagiotherapy uses biblical text as background to project one's own experiences against to active a greater understanding of text: one of the main instruments of hagiotherapy is projective work with biblical texts. Ivanƒçiƒá recently defined hagiotherapy as a scientific discipline which aims to heal the human soul. His thesis was that every human being does not have only physical and psychological dimension, but also spiritual dimension (human soul) that has its own scientific laws and it should be subject of scientific research. One of examples Ivanƒçiƒá gives is addiction. He was concerned with the fact that so many patients relapse some time after treatment. He explained it with the fact that they were treated only on mental level, and not on spiritual level. According to his opinion, addiction is basically spiritual issue, so it needs to be treated on spiritual level.Reme≈°, Prokop Hagioterapie ‚Äì nov√Ω smƒõr psychoterapie? ƒåesk√° a slovensk√° psychiatrie ƒç. 4 1998, p. 206-211, 94≈ò√≠ƒçan, Pavel Psychologie n√°bo≈æenstv√≠ a spirituality Port√°l, Praha, 2007, p. 306; Adamkoviƒçov√°, Denisa Aplik√°cia psychologick√Ωch aspektov biblick√Ωch pr√≠behov vo vybran√Ωch psychoterapeutick√Ωch smeroch RKCMBF UK Bratislava, 2011, http://www.ctar.sk/wp- content/uploads/DP_adamkovicova_PK.pdf; Friedlov√°, Anna Hagioterapie TF JU ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovic√≠ce, 2007, http://theses.cz/id/esctxh/; Holubov√°, Marie Hagioterapie ‚Äì vyu≈æit√≠ biblick√Ωch p≈ô√≠bƒõh≈Ø pro pr√°ci s klientem KSPSP FSS MU Brno, 2012, https://is.muni.cz/th/184105/fss_m?fakulta=1423;obdobi=5465;studium=601387;info=1;zpet=%2Fvyhledavani%2F%3Fsearch%3Ddiplomov%C3%A9%20pr%C3%A1ce%20hagioterapie%26start%3D1; Pitlachov√°, Kl√°ra Biblick√© p≈ô√≠bƒõhy jako zrcadlo ≈æivotn√≠ zku≈°enosti ƒçlovƒõka l√©ƒçen√©ho ze z√°vislosti na alkoholu FSS MU Brno, 2006, http://is.muni.cz/th/41485/fss_m/ References Supernatural healing Psychotherapy ","title":"Hagiotherapy"},{"id":"21322967","text":"We Didn't Come Here to Die is the first album by pop punk band The Copyrights.

Craven abandoned her music career in 2000, a mixture of writer's block and the need to take care of her three young daughters. In 2004 she made a slow comeback, doing a handful of live appearances, but was shortly after diagnosed with breast cancer. After receiving treatment and given the all- clear, Craven decided to resume her music career. Close to Home was released in March 2009 and was wholly written and produced by the singer. Craven released the album on her own label Campsie Music, and initially sold the album only through her website and at concerts. A promo single for \\"Rainbows\\" was sent to UK radio stations, and a videoclip was also recorded for it. The song was later available as a digital download single. The song, \\"Everlasting Love\\", was written and recorded in 1995 for the film First Knight (with the title \\"Legendary Love\\"); however, it was rejected by the film's producers. Two of the songs directly draw from her breast cancer diagnosis: \\"Rainbows\\" and \\"Without Me\\", which was written for her daughters.

Shunning a promising early career with Cardiff City Football Club, he enrolled at Cardiff College of Art in 1939, where he was taught and befriended by the painter Ceri Richards. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War and he was called up for service with the Royal Corps of Signals in North Africa. On his return he taught for a brief period at the Royal College of Art where the sculptor John Skeaping, a professor there, became a close friend. In 1945 he accepted a job at Newton Abbot Art School, before later becoming the Head of Art at South Devon College, Torquay. During this post-War period he produced paintings that reflected both his childhood in the grey iron town of Dowlais and the green landscape of his new life in Devon. It also marked an intense time of portrait painting, with influences ranging from Post-Impressionism to Picasso. His self-portraits from this period also form a small but masterly body of his work, in which the artist is searching out his real identity as an individual and as a painter in the aftermath of the War. The 1950s saw a new confidence in Davies' work with the artist's style moving away from representational views; during the 1960s, he took an even bolder step towards abstraction. The boats in the harbour became fragmented, for example, and his portraits were pared down into simple geometric forms. In the early 1970s he produced large, clean, sparse paintings eschewing figuration entirely but, as always in his work, powerful definition of line was preeminent. Indeed, at this time he produced a series of spot paintings and sculptures - some twenty years before Damien Hirst would think of his designs. This led him to begin to work more out of coloured perspex and wood. Davies retired as Head of South Devon College's school of Art in 1984. With less inclination to produce big paintings, he concentrated on woodcuts in his Newton Abbot studio. Davies died in 1996 . References * Edward Clark (ed.), Thomas Nathaniel Davies 1922-1996.

Since 1983 he was canon of Zagreb‚Äôs Cathedral Chapter. The areas of his scientific work are philosophy, theology and literature. The area of his special interest is the research of men‚Äôs existential-spiritual dimension, in which he was discovering new possibilities and ways of modern evangelisation and the need of developing spiritual medicine, which - next to somatic and psychiatric medicine - is indispensable in the holistic healing of man, and especially in healing spiritual illnesses and addictions. For this purpose he developed the method of hagiotherapy and founded the Centre for Spiritual Help in 1990 in Zagreb, which he was the head of. Apart from working at the Faculty, since 1971 Tomislav was also a religious teacher for students in Zagreb, the initiator of the prayer movement in the Church in Croatia, founder of the religious community ‚ÄúPrayer and Word‚Äù (Zajednica ‚ÄúMolitva i Rijeƒç‚Äù) and the ‚ÄúCentre for a Better World‚Äù, as well as lecturer at numerous seminars for the spiritual renewal in Croatia and abroad. In the last decade he has been training persons to work in centres for spiritual help and hold seminars for the apostolate of evangelisation in Croatia and abroad. His scientific and expert articles are published in Croatian and foreign magazines. He wrote more than 50 books, of which almost the half was translated into foreign languages, whereas some have been published only in foreign languages. His book ‚ÄúFollow Me‚Äù (Poƒëi za mnom) was translated in 12 languages. He was editor-in-chief of the magazine ‚ÄúSteps‚Äù (Koraci), and then ‚ÄúNew Steps‚Äù (Novi koraci), as well as founder of the magazine ‚ÄúHagiotherapy‚Äù (Hagioterapija).

It was introduced by the British government in 1980, with HM Revenue & Customs approval, according to a model set by the Treasury. From 6 April 2014, HMRC approval will no longer be required for a SAYE plan to obtain tax benefits, instead an employer is required to self-certify that the SAYE meets the requirements of the relevant legislation. Accordingly, from 6 April 2014, a SAYE plan should no longer be referred to as an HMRC approved plan. Mechanism Under sharesave, a company offers its employees the right (known as the option) to buy shares in the company at a future date. The option may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of the current share price. The employee then chooses to save between ¬£5 and ¬£500 per month out of their net pay over a three or five-year term. =Maturation= When the contract matures, a tax free bonus is received. The employee can then choose either to exercise the option to buy the shares with the proceeds from the savings contract, or just to take the proceeds and the bonus. The bonuses are equivalent to fixed rate interest and are set by the Treasury. The savings and bonus are free from income tax. However, an employee may have to pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT) if they sell their shares and make a profit which takes them above the CGT exemption limit for that year. An employee can transfer shares from the exercise of the option into a stocks and shares ISA, within 90 days of exercising the option. Capital gains made on these shares are then free from tax. There is a limit on the value of shares that can be transferred, and the ISA manager must agree to take them. =Conditions= Companies must offer sharesave to all employees who meet the eligibility criteria, which often include a requirement of up to five years' continuous employment. =Providers= Sharesave schemes are operated for companies by banks, building societies, or European Authorised Institutions which must first be authorised by the Treasury to operate. Yorkshire Building Society, Computershare, and Barclays are some of the domestic providers. Reception of the scheme The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and major political parties have acknowledged the benefits of employee share ownership. These benefits include an increased employee awareness of the effect of their actions on a company's success; enhanced relationships between employees and management; tax-free savings advantages for employees; expanded share-holder bases for companies; and increased employee motivation and enhanced performance.

It was broadcast in 13 episodes between July 5, 2005 and September 27, 2005. Summary In Zettai Seigi Love Pheromone, Aimi and Kaoruko are wannabe comedians and heroes of justice. As their manager, Tomokazu Seki, attempts to find them a job so they can rise to superstardom, they take part-time jobs as superheroine duo \\"Love Pheromone \\". They battle various evil, but as they destroy half the city every time, this leads to them being mistaken for evil creatures and feared by everyone. The other half of the show, Soreyuke! Gedou Otome Tai tells the story of the five Hokke sisters, who were abandoned by their now-deceased parents, and live in perpetual poverty. The family consists of, from oldest to youngest, Otone, Maika, Yoku, Kanashi, and Utano. One day, they release Akumako, an imp who was sealed in a vase left behind by their father. Akumako tells them that their parents belonged to an evil organisation, and that to carry on their parents' wishes, they must become \\"evil\\". To attempt this, they become the Gedou Otome Tai, a team of Magical Girls bent on carrying out evil. Unfortunately, all their efforts end up helping somebody, and they are mistakenly thought of as heroes. A recurring theme in Akahori Gedou Hour Rabuge is mistaken identity: both groups of girls are thought of as villains and heroes respectively. Another theme is following one's dreams, whether they are of being the world's greatest evil or being a famous comedy duo and having legions of fans. Episode lists Most of the episodes consist of two stories, one for Aimi and Kaoruko (Love Pheromone) and one for the Hokke sisters (Gedou Otome Tai), although occasionally they meet and interact with each other. In episodes 12 and 13, the stories merge into one as both groups act together against a common enemy.

The tradition of zakuski is linked to the Swedish and Finnish br√§nnvinsbord which was also the ancestor of modern sm√∂rg√•sbord and to meze of the Ottoman Empire and other Middle Eastern cultures. Zakuski are not served as in Scandinavia at the buffet but on the dining table. Zakuski are also a food-in-itself and often not just served as starter to a meal. Zakuski were kept in the houses of the Russian gentry for feeding casual visitors who travelled long distances and whose arrival time was often unpredictable. At banquets and parties, zakuski were often served in a separate room adjacent to the dining room or on a separate table in the dining room. The tradition eventually spread to other layers of society and remained in the Soviet times, but due to lack of space, they were served on the dinner table. Zakuski became thus the first course of a festive dinner. Nowadays, these appetizers are commonly served at banquets, dinners, parties and receptions in countries which were formerly part of the Russian Empire including some post-Soviet states and Poland (Polish: zakƒÖski). A broad selection of zakuski constitutes a standard first course at any feast table. Usually, zakuski are already laid on the table when guests are called to the dining room. Typical zakuski consist of cold cuts, cured fishes, mixed salads, kholodets (meat jelly), pirogs or pirozhki, various pickled vegetables such as tomatoes, beets, cucumbers, sauerkraut, pickled mushrooms, deviled eggs, hard cheeses, caviar, canap√©s, open sandwiches, and breads.JOC All New Rev. - 1997 - Irma S.

At the time the human reference was initially described, it was clear that some regions were recalcitrant to closure with existing technology. The main reason for improving the reference assemblies are that they are the cornerstones upon which all whole genome studies are based (e.g. the 1000 Genomes Project). The GRC is a collaborative effort which interacts with various groups in the scientific community, however the primary member institutes are: * The Wellcome Sanger Institute * The McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University * The European Bioinformatics Institute * The National Center for Biotechnology Information Initially the focus lies with the Human and the Mouse reference genomes, but in mid-late 2010 full maintenance and improvement of the Zebrafish genome sequence was also added to the GRC. The goal of the Consortium is to correct the small number of regions in the reference that are currently misrepresented, to close as many remaining gaps as possible and to produce alternative assemblies of structurally variant loci when necessary. As of September 2019, the major assembly releases for human, mouse, zebrafish, and chicken are GRCh38, GRCm38, GRCz11, and GRCg6a respectively. Major assembly releases do not follow a fixed cycle, however there are \\"minor\\" assembly updates in the form of genome patches which either correct errors in the assembly or add additional alternate loci. These assemblies are represented in various genome browsers and databases including Ensembl, those in NCBI and UCSC Genome Browser.  Notable staff  * Deanna M.

It is the first line in history to have a tunnel going under the Nile. The tunnel under the Nile is 8.35m in internal diameter and was constructed using two Herenknecht bentonite slurry shield TBMs, which are 9.43m in diameter. Extending with 20 stations, it is sometimes called the \\"Japanese-Built Line\\". It is mostly in bored tunnel, with two exceptions: a short section at the northern end approaching Shubra El-Kheima which is elevated, and a section just south of this by cut-and-cover. The main difference between Lines 1 and 2 is that Line 1 uses an overhead line while Line 2 uses the third-rail system. The construction of the line was finished in October 2000 and was later extended to El Mounib. The communication for line 2 was provided by Alcatel in 2005. Total project cost was 761 million euros.

Life He was the son of William Russell, an organ-builder, and was born in London on 6 October 1777. From age seven Russell was taught by the organists William Cope, William Shrubsole, and John Groombridge. Between 1789 and 1793 he was deputy to his father, who was organist to St. Mary's, Aldermanbury. In 1793 Russell was appointed organist to the Great Queen Street chapel; cathedral services were performed there until 1798, when the chapel became a Wesleyan meeting-house. On 2 September 1798 he was elected organist at St. Anne's, Limehouse. In 1801 he was elected to a similar post at the Foundling Hospital. About the same time he resumed musical studies under Samuel Arnold. In 1808 Russell graduated Mus. Bac. at Oxford. He died on 21 November 1813 at Cobham Row, Coldbath Fields, in Clerkenwell. Works Russell's organ voluntaries were in suite form. He published Twelve Voluntaries for the Organ or Pianoforte (1807?), and a Second Book (1812). Job was an oratorio adaptation for organ or pianoforte, from Samuel Wesley, issued in 1826. He also composed music to Christopher Smart's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day (1800) and the Redemption of Israel, both of which were probably performed by the Cecilian Society, of which he was a member. A volume of psalms, hymns, and anthems was compiled by him for the Foundling Chapel in 1809. Through Arnold's influence Russell obtained employment as composer and accompanist at theatres. Besides songs, he wrote overtures and incidental music. For Sadler's Wells he composed an overture to the Highland Camp (1800); music to Old Sadler's Ghost, to the Great Devil (with Broad), to Harlequin Greenlander, to St. George, to Zoa, and to Wizard's Wake in 1802. For Covent Garden Theatre he wrote a dance in Thomas Busby's Rugantino (1805), a new overture to Wild Islanders, and music for Adrian and Orilla (1806). For the Royal Circus he prepared music for the pieces Harlequin and Time and False Friend (1806).

A fundamental premise of the organization is that social technology on the web can play a part in enabling citizen-to-citizen diplomacy between the peoples of Arab and Western countries, thereby helping to improve cross-cultural understanding. Meedan's vision is thus to \\"innovate technologies that enable dialogues across linguistic, cultural, and ideological boundaries\\".\\"Vision\\", http://www.meedan.net The company describes itself as \\"multi-cultural, non-partisan, non-ideological, and supportive of diverse viewpoints\\".\\"Mission\\", http://www.meedan.net Features=Dialogue platform= Meedan‚Äôs core product is a forum for cross-language conversation and media sharing in Arabic and English. Users can browse aggregated sources around world events ‚Äì blogs and mainstream sources; opinion and reporting; Arabic and English writing ‚Äì and help expand the news narrative by posting articles and comments themselves. All sources and comments are mirrored across Arabic and English using a combination of machine and human translation. Users can also make friends with other users and upload their profile to their My Meedan page. =Translation= Meedan's translation technology has been developed in collaboration with The Watson Research Group at IBM with which it entered into a research partnership in 2006. Development has focused on Machine and Machine Augmented Translation tools that enable users to improve translations collaboratively, including IBM's Transbrowser ‚Äì a browser tool for creating a translation layer on the web. Perhaps most significantly, Meedan is open licensing the linguistic data generated from its efforts. Improved translation automation and augmentation has profound implications in global media, education, and business and information services; Meedan hopes to play a small part by leading an effort to steer the global computational linguistics community to embrace open licensing of linguistic corpora. Meedan aims to contribute to the Arabic English linguistic corpus, and therefore improve MT quality, by providing translation services to individuals and partner organizations. Meedan is especially interested in advancing progress in the under served direction of source English to target Arabic machine translation. Challenges=Translation= Machine Translation is often considered to be unreliable in rendering correct ‚Äúcontext-dependent meanings‚Äù as well as coherent and grammatically correct sentences (particularly when dealing with languages, such as Arabic and English, with very different sentence structures).Giles, Jim. \\"Learning to talk\\". https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/magazine/14wwln- idealab-t.html?_r=4&ref;=magazine. Retrieved on 30 January 2009. Meedan's software, however, appears to be more than mere Machine Translation. With a large linguistic corpus and overseen by a staff of over 20 professional translators, Meedan‚Äôs translations are more likely to be accurate in both their grammar and meaning. Moreover, Meedan‚Äôs users can edit and improve translations themselves. These improved translations are then stored on the Machine Translation software to be used in the same context in the future. Thus, as more users participate in conversations and help broaden the machine translation‚Äôs ‚Äòvocabulary‚Äô, so the potential errors of machine translation should be reduced. The dependence on human translators to enhance the quality of the translation is not free of problems. Besides syntactic and semantic factors there are factors of style and aesthetics of the target language. While many so-called professional translators could produce comprehensible text of higher quality than machine translation, the quality of the text in the target language is difficult to assess. Awkward or unfluent texts, when admitted in the system, may establish norms and frame of reference that don't serve the purpose of enhancing the overall quality of translation, and an example for translators, or aspiring translators to imitate. This, however, is arguably outside of the scope of the project. Steering committee Meedan's steering committee was established in October 2008 to serve as a high level advisory panel for the project. Members include: the Director of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Dr. Ismail Serageldin; Dr Sabri Saidam, minister of telecoms and IT for the Palestinian Authority serving in the ninth Palestinian cabinet; and prominent media personality Muna Abu Sulayman, Executive Director of the Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation, the philanthropic arm of HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal's Kingdom Holding Company.

In his youth, he was known as one of the most skilled card players in the United States. Following his retirement from gambling in 1842, he became an active crusader against illegal gambling and was responsible for enacting anti-gambling laws in several states. As an agent for the New York Association for the Suppression of Gambling, he conducted an exhaustive report detailing illegal gambling operations active in the city in 1850-51. He later toured the country as a lecturer and eventually published his memoirs entitled Twelve Days in the Tombs (1851), The Gambler's Life (1857) and The Reformed Gambler (1858). Biography Jonathan Green was born in Ohio in 1813, although the Library of Congress catalog gives 1812 as the year of his birth. He became an accomplished professional gambler as a young man, popularly known from Texas to Boston as \\"Captain Green\\", and was a regular riverboat gambler on the Mississippi River. Among his most noted accomplishments was winning $23,000 in one night at the old Chestnut Street Arcade during the 1830s. After living in Texas for several years, he suddenly abandoned gambling in 1842. Making restitution to those who had lost money to him, he traveled the country as a lecturer exposing common gambling tricks and spoke out against illegal gambling for the next nine years. His popularity as \\"the Reformed Gambler\\" gained a significant following and helped pass anti-gambling laws in several states. He also wrote several books on the subject including \\"Green on Gambling\\", An Exposure of the Arts and Miseries of Gambling (1843),books.google.com/books?id=rCsPAQAAMAAJ Gambling Unmasked (1844), The Secret Band of Brothers (1848), Gambling in Its Infancy and Progress (1849) and An Exposition of Games and Tricks with Cards (1850).\\"Dropping Out Of Public Sight.

Green, The Reformed Gambler\\". _New York Times._ 30 May 1884 Green became a general executive agent of the New York Association for the Suppression of Gambling and, between 1850‚Äì51, he conducted an exhaustive investigation on illegal gambling operations in New York City. On February 20, 1851, he presented his findings at the Brooklyn Tabernacle reporting the existence of an estimated 6,000 gambling houses, 200 of these being high-class establishments \\"catering to men of standing and sound financial substance\\", as well as several thousand raffling, lottery and policy houses. Green was one of several prominent speakers, most notably Horace Greeley, who addressed the large crowd.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 79-80) He continued writing and published his memoirs Twelve Days in the Tombs (1851), The Gambler's Life (1857) and The Reformed Gambler (1858). Green returned to Indiana at the start of the American Civil War and became a captain in the Union Army and was later employed by the US Secret Service. An amateur inventor, he took out 20 to 30 patents although his inventions proved far more profitable to others than to himself. He moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1876 and lived a private retired life. He eventually became destitute in his old age and, following his wife's death in 1884, a public appeal was made when he was unable to pay for his wife's funeral. Donations from \\"kindly minded friends\\" were sufficient enough to allow Green to bury his wife.\\"Help For Capt. Green\\". _New York Times._ 1 Jun 1884 Green himself died three years later.

The band originally played under the name Really Free and later Really Free Band, then abbreviated to RFB. The name is a reference to the New Testament bible verse John 8:36. Really Free Band toured in the UK, Europe and the USA, and performed at the inaugural Greenbelt Festival in 1974. Musical Styles The overall continuity in musical direction was provided by Cliff Bergdahl, who has a university degree in music. Given the changes in musician members over the years, the band's style tended to reflect a blend of his evolving personal preferences, the aspirations/abilities of the extent musicians (who were encouraged to contribute their own material), and a contemporary selection of material intended to appeal musically to the intended audience - while containing some explicitly Christian content. Inspired initially by the bright, jangling guitar-based sound of mid-1960s British beat, Really Free looked to incorporate elements of musical grit as well as a light-touch of prog rock - all of this with a background influence of 1970s Americana that manifested more in the use of strong melody and harmony vocals than in the repertoire. There was some influence from reggae. In some ways the style was defined by what it was not: Cliff wanted to create an authentically British sound that could incorporate the excitement of rock music without the decadence of glam rock, the drug associations of psychedelia, the hedonism of disco, the oblivion of heavy metal or the nihilism of punk. In a typical live concert setting, Really Free would deliver a mixed programme of mostly original high energy, guitar-based melodic rock songs, some current pop charts hits or rock 'n' roll standards, interspersed with a solo acoustic song and a more progressive, reflective instrumental work. There would sometimes be a drum solo included in the set. They aimed to play at least one song in three that the audience would know and like. Some songs had specifically religious gospel content, others were providing social commentary and others were included simply for fun. In the full-time period (1973-80), Really Free would compare themselves to Wishbone Ash or Thin Lizzy, both bands having a distinctive twin lead guitar sound. Theology Cliff Bergdahl is an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church (USA) Cliff attained theological qualifications at London Bible College which was an extra-mural college of the University of London.particularly among young people and using music. For many years he was a member of British Youth for Christ which provided a level of local oversight and authentication to enable working in cooperation with churches. Cliff‚Äôs personal theology set the tone for the group which was broadly in the Low Church Protestant Reformed tradition. The group members were variously enthusiastic or struggling believers, but generally without the benefit of formal theological education. They would often pray or read the Bible before concerts or in band meetings. Really Free operated on two levels as a band: * It was a collaborative working environment in which young men could grow musically and spiritually, bonding by participating in the excitement and practical difficulties of outreach work. * It presented a direct Christian voice into the audiences, mostly outside of a church context. ‚ÄúWho are the prophets of today?‚Äù was a question that Cliff challenged members with on more than one occasion, the implicit answer being - ‚Äúmusicians‚Äù. The band did not play worship songs for congregational participation because the typical performances were in schools and university concerts, prisons and recordings. Nevertheless, some of the material (eg. ‚ÄúThankyou Jesus‚Äù, ‚ÄúReverence for the Lord‚Äù) was intentionally worshipful, providing an opportunity for spiritual reflection. Cliff understood that ‚Äúyou have to earn the right to be heard‚Äù and at some point in a full-evening concert, there would usually be a few minute‚Äôs personal Christian testimony from band members. Audience members were encouraged to meet the band after the show and discuss spiritual matters. There was also opportunity for people to follow-up via a postcard contact scheme that could direct them towards a local Christian church. In this scenario, the practical theology was operating in the expectation of inform-challenge-commit type of evangelical conversion, which had been the personal experience elsewhere for at least some of the band members. Cliff introduced the band (c.1973) to the concepts of gradual growth towards Christian commitment, with necessary preliminary steps of a generalized awakening of spiritual dimension to life and a basic knowledge of Christ. The band was to focus on these ‚Äòpre-evangelism‚Äô stages with the intent that churches would undertake to encourage people on a long-term basis with the embrace of a Christian community that an itinerant rock band could not provide.

Home Page He had the good fortune to live a long life almost entirely within the span of the twentieth century, giving us a valuable witness through his work with innovative architectural vernaculars and proposals, from his understanding of the complexity of events, transformations, and ideas that animated the twentieth century. He was one of the major Italian architects of that century, known for famous projects such as the Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station and the San Giovanni Battista church on the Autostrada del Sole. He came from a family which owned an outstanding workshop for artistic iron craftsmanship and his youthful formative years were spent immersed in that world, after graduating from the Higher Institute of Architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence. In 1914 he was licensed as a professor of architectural design; so he could teach at the Institute of Architecture of Florence, and became Dean of the Faculty of Architecture in 1944. Renato Fondi became involved in book projects, one of the \\"Famiglia Artistica\\" and \\"La Tempra\\", which bind to the critical Pistoia also in the subsequent experiences in Rome. During the war Michelucci built his first architectural work, a chapel on the eastern front in Casale Ladra, near Caporetto (today in Slovenia); later he was often forced to face the effects of trauma (the reconstruction of the center of Florence after the Second World War, the church at Longarone after the tragedy of Vajont dam, the plan for the popular Santa Croce district in Florence after the 1966 flood of the Arno).  1918‚Äì1945  After World War I he left Pistoia and the family's \\"Officine Michelucci\\" and moved to Rome. He met Eloisa Pacini, a refined painter and pianist, also from Pistoia, who belonged to the same artistic milieu where Michelucci played an important role in intellectual culture. They married in 1928, sharing a strong social awareness during their life together. Life in Rome was experienced as an extraordinary opportunity to study the architecture of the holy city and to build new work experience. His ability to focus on relationships with contemporary needs was recognized in 1933 when, as coordinator of the Gruppo Toscano (Tuscan Group) with Baroni, Berardi, Gamberini, Guarnieri and Lusanna, he gained first prize in the architectural contest for the Santa Maria Novella new railway station in Florence with a work that won international acclaim not only for its rational and functional qualities but also for the quality of its integration into the historical and urban context. He reaffirmed the value of attention to architectural history and the desire to escape from rhetorical excitement, which was thought to represent an era, confronting modern architectural challenges removed from the feeling of conforming to a current architecture or blindly tied to one style. Between December '45 and January '46 he founded the magazine \\"La Nuova Citt√†\\". In that period, from observing the bomb rubble of the destroyed center of Florence, he produced firm ideas and plans for the reconstruction of the area around Ponte Vecchio. These concepts for innovative spaces clashed with the award-winning, elitist trend of reconstruction \\"like it was where it was\\" that would deliver a series of historical fakes responsible for the future museification of the city.  1945‚Äì1990  The church of San Giovanni Battista, Highway A11, called \\"Church of the Motorway\\" (1960-64) photographed by Paolo Monti Michelucci‚Äôs thesis was innovative but not accepted, this defeat heavily influencing his teaching at the Faculty of Architecture, where he was now Dean. In fact, in 1948, Michelucci left the Faculty in Florence, and became a professor at the Faculty of Engineering in Bologna, where he remained until the conclusion of his teaching activity and where he found a more fertile ground for the development of his themes. The first turning point work after the war, a small church in the countryside of Pistoia, is a manifesto against the fashionable rhetoric and focused on the human dimension, using the language of rural architecture in order to restore the main religious and civil meeting center of a small and poor community, marking definitively the real role of architecture in the service of his idea of \\"The New City\\". Many later works included social housing, workers' villages, public buildings, banks, churches, museum, social spaces for prisons, hospitals, schools and other projects, always developed around the idea of a friendly, supportive, democratic community-city, where architecture is open to the city, people-oriented and far from disciplinary boundaries of styles and languages. Sadly leaving the university because of his age, he dedicated his work to rigorous research with which he prepared, singularly but not limited to, a new revolution in the language of architecture: the concept of space wherever accessible, variety, the refusal of formulaic and technocratic diagrams, a new relation between ancient and modern, which was also expressed through combining stones, bricks, concrete, steel, glass and new materials used architecturally, but mainly in a symbolic way. During the '60s, with the church of San Giovanni Battista, Highway A11, called \\"Church of the Motorway\\", near Florence and the Church in the San Marino Republic, Michelucci fulfilled his earlier premises and completed his revolutionary designs, based on a search for the uniqueness between structure and architecture, with space developed as an architectural path. Enthusiastic and tireless promoter of cultural initiatives and activities even in his later years, he participated with great passion in the fundamental issues of the debate about the city and always with innovative and unconventional positions.  Michelucci Foundation  In 1982 the architect, with Regione Toscana and the cities of Fiesole and Pistoia, decided to establish the \\"Fondazione Giovanni Michelucci\\" which he guided until his demise. He bequeathed his vision and values to the Foundation, that he wanted to be attentive to the social problems of the city and to the separate worlds of total institutions as prison, asylum, hospitals. He committed the Foundation to offering ideas and plans for action on the chronic urban question, how to reconnect separate spaces by a new design of the city, giving witness to a way of life and to making architecture meet the needs of the people. The Foundation now also conserves his archives, his works, his writings, his ideal heritage. The Michelucci Foundation was established to \\"contribute to research and study on city planning and modern and contemporary architecture, with a special attention to the problems regarding social facilities, hospitals, prisons, schools‚Äù. Today, the Michelucci Foundation is a relevant and innovative actor in research and planning on social habitat and on the relationship between space and society. The Foundation coordinates several projects and researches in partnership with local authorities and cultural institutions, developing programs and proposals to integrate the local policies on the most relevant urban problems: migration, housing exclusion, suburbs, urban security, health References  * Michelucci Giovanni.

Prelude The convention's d√©put√©s were instructed to put an end to the crisis that had broken out since the prevented flight to Varennes of Louis XVI (June 1791) and the bloody capture of the Tuileries (10 August 1792). Their middle-class origin and their political activity meant that most of them bore no sympathy for the monarchy, and the victory at the battle of Valmy on 20 September (the revolution's first military success) occurred on the same day as their meeting, thus confirming their convictions.  Proposition for abolition  When the d√©put√© for Paris, Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois, proposed abolition he met with little resistance; at most, Claude Basire, friend of Georges Jacques Danton, tried to temper the enthusiasm, recommending a discussion before any decision. However, abb√© Henri Gr√©goire, constitutional bishop of Blois, replied strongly to any suggestion of discussion: Jean-Fran√ßois Ducos supported him in affirming that any discussion would be useless \\"after the lights spread by 10 August\\". The summary argument served as a debate and the decision taken was unanimous, giving birth to the First French Republic. End of an era In the wake of the proclamation, efforts grew to eliminate the vestiges of the ancien regime. As the date of the Republic's first anniversary approached, the Convention passed a set of laws replacing many familiar ancien systems of order and measurement, including the old Christian calendar.Doyle, p. 194. This dramatic change was powerful encouragement to the growing wave of anticlericalism which sought a dechristianisation of France. The new French Republican Calendar discarded all Christian reference points and calculated time from the Republic's first full day after the monarchy, 22 September 1792, the first day of Year One.

It is in the southern half of the civil parish of Cranford , next to Cranford St Andrew - both named after the two parish churches. The two settlements are divided by the Aledge Brook, a feeder to the River Ise; the derivation of the name is \\"ford frequented by cranes or herons\\".Mills, A.D. (1998). A Dictionary of English Place-names. Second Edition. Oxford University Press, Oxford. p100. The only public house left is the Red Lion in Cranford St John. The old station house is the station building of the Kettering to Cambridge standard gauge railway that used to run along the side of the village. The Church was largely built in the thirteenth century, including the tower, but there is an early Norman archway in the north arcade, possibly moved from the original tower, and the rest of the arcade is late twelfth century. The south aisle was built in 1842. The former Sunday school has been converted into a residential property.  Quarrying  Cranford St John SSSI is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest which exposes rocks dating to the Jurassic period. It is the remains of an iron ore quarry which closed in 1969 and was the last of the iron ore quarries in the area. Limestone and, more especially, iron ore were once quarried extensively in the area. Much of the quarried ground is now covered by the new A14 road. The limestone and ore was taken from the quarries and mines by tramway to two sidings on the railway for transport to iron works elsewhere. One of the sidings was close to the east of the station. The other was further away to the west. The limestone quarries were to the south east and south west of the village, on the south side of the railway. They operated between 1880 and 1894. . The iron ore quarries to the west of the village began in 1878 on the north side of the railway and were extended south of the railway in 1880. Quarrying on these sites ceased 1897 and in 1909 ore was obtained by tunnelling at a number of locations into the quarry sides. These adits enabled mining to be done by the \\"pillar and stall method\\" until 1913. Later, parts of the mine collapsed leaving some depressions called sink holes in the ground above. To the east of the village iron ore quarrying took place north of the railway between 1899 and 1909 and south of the old main road from 1900 to 1969. This quarry worked its way westward and to the south of the village. It is unclear whether the tramways associated with the quarries and mine used horses or steam locomotives to start with. Certainly from 1889 steam locomotives were used except inside the mine. At that time the lines were metre gauge. The remaining tramway was converted to standard gauge in 1923. The quarries and the mine were at first worked by hand but steam quarrying machines were introduced in 1918. Diesel machines were introduced from 1930 and electric from 1940 but right up to 1969 one of the steam machines was in use.Tonks, Eric pages 30-75 The last remaining chimney just outside the village was demolished during the building of the A14 road (which was built on a large section of the old railway line by Cranford).

Allegations The allegations were made by The Sunday Times Insight team in an article published on Sunday, 25 January 2009. In a series of covert interviews, the four peers stated that they could use their political influence to amend legislation. The individuals concerned were Lord Snape, Lord Moonie, Lord Taylor of Blackburn and Lord Truscott. Six other peers either declined to help or did not respond to the undercover reporters' approach. The newspaper claimed its reporters approached the four peers masquerading as lobbyists acting for an unnamed company. The firm, they said, wanted to set up a chain of shops in the UK and were seeking exemption from current laws on business rates. A recording was later released of Lord Taylor saying firms paid him up to ¬£100,000 a year. Lord Taylor tells an undercover reporter: \\"Some companies that I work with would pay me ¬£100,000 a year.\\" When the reporter questions it, he adds: \\"That's cheap for what I do for them. And other companies would pay me ¬£25,000.\\" On 30 January, The Sunday Times released further material via their website containing audio and video purporting to show Lord Truscott describing how the passage of legislation in both the House of Commons and House of Lords could be influenced and what part he could play in successfully facilitating amendments on behalf of paying clients. Two of the fundamental principles set out in the Code of Conduct for the House of Lords are that members \\"must never accept any financial inducement as an incentive or reward for exercising parliamentary influence\\" and \\"must not vote on any bill or motion, or ask any question in the House or a committee, or promote any matter, in return for payment or any other material benefit (the \\"no paid advocacy\\" rule).\\" Reaction Following publication of The Sunday Times article, the Labour Party immediately promised an urgent investigation. The Leader in the House of Lords, Lady Royall said she had spoken to the four Labour peers concerned and would be \\"pursuing the matter with utmost vigour\\". She also said House of Lords members must \\"abide by its high standards.\\" In a statement to the House of Lords on 26 January Lady Royall called the claims \\"deeply shocking\\". She pointed out that they were only allegations at this stage but said the claims had been \\"damaging not just to this House but to Parliament and politics\\". She said the matter had been referred to the Lords Interests sub committee (a sub committee of the Committee for Privileges), which had already met and investigations were underway. She said she believed \\"tougher sanctions\\" were needed to deal with peers who broke the rules and she had written to the chairman of the Committee on Standards and Privileges to ask him to review the matter. On 26 January, two of the four peers made statements in The House of Lords. Lord Snape told The House \\"As one of the people involved in this incident may I first of all apologise for bringing this House, if I have done so, into disrepute. But may I say that these are allegations in a Sunday newspaper and may I appeal to noble lords in all parts of the House to allow me the opportunity to refute these allegations before your lordships house and elsewhere.\\" Lord Taylor stated \\"If I have done anything that has brought this House into disrepute I most humbly apologise. I feel within my own conscience I followed the rules and the directions that have been given in this House over the 31 years I have been a member.\\" Lord Truscott told the BBC he did admit to having had \\"discussions\\" with a reporter, but said that \\"to suggest I would offer to put down amendments for money is a lie.\\" Lord Moonie acknowledged discussing a fee of ¬£30,000 but said he had not done anything \\"outside the rules\\". The Conservative Party leader in the Lords, Lord Strathclyde, said the allegations represented a \\"shocking and depressing moment\\" for the House of Lords. \\"This House has been mired in a grim torrent of criticism about a culture of sleaze,\\" he told peers. \\"If these allegations are true those involved have shamed this House,\\" he said, adding there were no \\"grey areas in the paid advocacy rules\\". Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: \\"It's important that we don't pre-judge these investigations but these are serious allegations and we are determined to get to the bottom of these allegations, and whatever action needs to be taken will be taken.\\" The Liberal Democrats wrote to Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson asking for an investigation to take place. SNP MP Angus MacNeil, whose complaint started the \\"cash for honours\\" called for the four peers to be suspended, while an investigation is carried out. Findings of House of Lords Committees The House of Lords Sub- committee on Lords' Interests was asked to report on the matter. Lords Sub- Committee on Lords Interests Report It found that Lord Moonie had not expressed a willingness to breach the code, but that Lord Snape, Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor had all done so. Truscott and Taylor were additionally found to have failed to act on their personal honour. The Lords' Privileges Committee considered the sub-committee's report and heard further evidence from Lord Snape. It published its findings on 14 May 2009. It found that Lord Moonie and Lord Snape had not breached the code, but that Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor had done, and recommended that they be suspended.The Conduct of Lord Moonie, Lord Snape, Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor of Blackburn Lords Privileges Committee Report Police investigations On 29 January 2009 it was confirmed that Police were looking at the allegations following the complaint by the Liberal Democrats. On 11 February 2009 the Metropolitan Police confirmed that no action would be taken, noting that \\"The application of the criminal law to members of the House of Lords in the circumstances that have arisen here is far from clear,\\" and that \\"In addition, there are very clear difficulties in gathering and adducing evidence in these circumstances in the context of parliamentary privilege.\\" See also *Reform of the House of Lords *Cash-for-questions affair *Cash for Honours *Political parties *Revolving door References Labour Party (UK) scandals 2009 in British politics Lobbying in the United Kingdom Corruption in the United Kingdom Political funding in the United Kingdom January 2009 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"2009 cash for influence scandal"},{"id":"21323602","text":"Adel Abdessemed (born 1971) is an Algerian contemporary artist. He has worked in a variety of media, including animation, installation, performance, sculpture and video. Some of his work relates to the topic of violence in the world.  Biography  Abdessemed was born in Constantine, in eastern Algeria, to a Chaoui Berber family. He grew up in the area of the Aur√®s Mountains, and attended the in Batna. He then studied at the in Algiers. He left in 1994. Between 1994 and 1999, Abdessemed attended the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux-arts in Lyon, in eastern central France. He then lived and worked in the Cit√© internationale des arts in Paris. In 2000‚Äì2001 he was a resident artist at P.S.1 in New York. After spending some time in Berlin, he returned in 2004 to Paris. He is also a French citizen. He met his wife in a bar in Lyon called L‚ÄôAntidote in the mid-1990s, an episode represented in the small replica of the venue in a vitrine in the exhibition at MAC in Lyon. Work Adel Abdessemed grew up in Algeria amid civil war tensions, and has been greatly affected by the media exposure of the Gulf War and its global impact. If the collapse of the machine and the first Big War at the beginning of the 20th Century contributed in no small part to the establishment of an art that was suddenly provoking and difficult to look at, the availability of images from the war front in the 1990s made the same process impossible. There is little point in trying to tackle brutality by denouncing it via a series of trite statements or graphic imagery. Adel Abdessemed stated about his work ¬´I think my work is actually positive. The world is violent ‚Äì not me¬ª. Abdessemed's life-size sculptural variations of iconic images, such as the nine-year-old Phan Th·ªã Kim Ph√∫c (nicknamed ‚Äòthe Napalm Girl‚Äô) running away naked from an explosion throughout the Vietnam War in 1972 or the French football player Zinedine Zidane headbutting Marco Materazzi during the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final (Headbutt) are only two examples of how the immediacy of such moments take on fresh meaning when solidified in a form designed to make them still and everlasting. And even in those moments when the relationship between subject and rendition is a bit more fluid, as for example with the combination of the Antonio Canova-inspired sculpture group Is Beautiful with the terracotta-made, hard working men depicted in Sham, the outcome doesn't seem to change. This is not a literal representation of reality, but rather a sublimation of iconic images to art that takes place. Adel Abdessemed is known to have a special way to laugh. While studying art in Algeria, one of his professors defined it ‚ÄòThe Devil‚Äôs Laugh‚Äô.A meeting with Adel Abdessemed, Lise G√©henneux; Crash Magazine, 14 August 2018.

He was virulently opposed to La Fayette. Protection from Marat meant he escaped a purge on 2 June 1793, but he fell under suspicion due to his protests against the arrests and summary 'disappearances'.

When X-rays hit matter, part of the incoming beam is transmitted through the material and part of it is absorbed by the material. The amount absorbed is dependent on the material's mass absorption coefficient and tends to decrease for incident photons of greater energy. True absorption occurs when X-rays of sufficient energy cause electron energy level transitions in the atoms of the absorbing material. The energy from these X-rays are used to excite the atoms and do not continue past the material (thus being \\"filtered\\" out). Because of this, despite the general trend of decreased absorption at higher energy wavelengths, there are periodic spikes in the absorption characteristics of any given material corresponding to each of the atomic energy level transitions. These spikes are called absorption edges. The result is that every material preferentially filters out x-rays corresponding to and slightly above their electron energy levels, while generally allowing X-rays with energies slightly less than these levels to transmit through relatively unscathed. Therefore, it is possible to selectively fine tune which wavelengths of x-rays are present in a beam by matching materials with particular absorption characteristics to different X-ray source spectra. Applications For example, a copper X-ray source may preferentially produce a beam of x-rays with wavelengths 154 and 139 picometres. Nickel has an absorption edge at 149 pm, between the two copper lines. Thus, using nickel as a filter for copper would result in the absorption of the slightly higher energy 139 pm x-rays, while letting the 154 pm rays through without a significant decrease in intensity. Thus, a copper X-ray source with a nickel filter can produce a nearly monochromatic X-ray beam with photons of mostly 154 pm. For medical purposes, X-ray filters are used to selectively attenuate, or block out, low-energy rays during x-ray imaging (radiography). Low energy x-rays (less than 30 keV) contribute little to the resultant image as they are heavily absorbed by the patient's soft tissues (particularly the skin). Additionally, this absorption adds to the risk of stochastic (e.g. cancer) or non stochastic radiation effects (e.g. tissue reactions) in the patient. Thus, it is favorable to remove these low energy X-rays from the incident light beam. X-ray filtration may be inherent due to the X-ray tube and housing material itself or added from additional sheets of filter material. The minimum filtration used is usually 2.5 mm aluminium (Al) equivalent, although there is an increasing trend to use greater filtration. Manufacturers of modern fluoroscopy equipment utilize a system of adding a variable thickness of copper (Cu) filtration according to patient thickness. This typically ranges from 0.1 to 0.9 mm Cu. X-ray filters are also used for X-ray crystallography, in determinations of the interatomic spaces of crystalline solids. These lattice spacings can be determined using Bragg diffraction, but this technique requires scans to be done with approximately monochromatic X-ray beams. Thus, filter set ups like the copper nickel system described above are used to allow only a single X-ray wavelength to penetrate through to a target crystal, allowing the resulting scattering to determine the diffraction distance. Various elemental effects Suitable for X-ray crystallography: * Zirconium - Absorbs Bremsstrahlung & K-Beta. * Iron - Absorbs the entire spectra. * Molybdenum - Absorbs Bremsstrahlung - Leaving K-Beta & K-Alpha. * Aluminium - 'Pinches' Bremsstrahlung* & Removes 3rd Generation peaks. * Silver - Same as Aluminium, But to greater extent. * Indium - Same as Iron, But to lesser extent. * Copper - Same as Aluminium, Leaving only 1st Generation Peaks. Suitable for Radiography: * Molybdenum - Used in Mammography * Rhodium - Used in Mammography with Rhodium anodes * Aluminium - Used in general radiography x-ray tubes * Copper - Used in general radiography - especially in paediatric applications. * Silver - Used in Mammography with tungsten anode * Tantalum - Used in fluoroscopy applications with tungsten anodes * Niobium - Used in radiography and dental radiography with tungsten anodes * Erbium - Used in radiography with tungsten anodes Notes: * - Bremsstrahlung pinching is due to the atomic mass. The denser the atom, the higher the X-Ray Absorption. Only the higher energy X-Rays pass through the filter, appearing as if the Bremsstrahlung continuum had been pinched. * - In this case, Mo appears to leave K-Alpha and K-Beta alone while absorbing the Bremsstrahlung. This is due to Mo absorbing all of the spectra's energy, but in doing so produces the same characteristic peaks as generated by the target.  Further reading  * B.D. Cullity & S.R.

Life He was the only son of Thomas Earle of Sall, Norfolk and his wife Anne Founteyn (spellings vary). He was born at Sall and educated at Norwich Grammar School. He was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 7 April 1612, and subsequently called to the bar there. Sir Julius Caesar appointed him steward of his manors of East Bradenham and Huntingfield Hall in 1626. He was a bencher of his inn between 1635 and 1641 inclusive, and was reader there in the autumn of 1639. In 1640 he purchased Heydon Hall from Sir Robert Kemp.http://www.broadland.gov.uk/leisure_and_tourism/1174.asp In 1644 he was appointed with John Thurloe secretary to the English Parliamentary commissioners for the treaty of Uxbridge. On 4 January 1647 he was returned to Parliament for the City of Norwich. As a member of the Long Parliament and Rump Parliament, he was no radical, but with the group of conservative lawyers, including Nathaniel Bacon, William Ellis, Nicholas Lechmere, Lislibone Long, and William Stephens.Blair Worden, The Rump Parliament 1648-1653 (1974) p. 65 and p. 109. On 12 October 1648 he was called to the degree of serjeant-at-law. The same year he was appointed steward, and the following year recorder of the city of Norwich. The latter office he held until 1653. The only public act of importance which marked his tenure of this office was the trial (for which he received a special commission) of some rioters in the streets of Norwich, showing their disgust at the suspension of the mayor by the parliament and their sympathy with the royalist cause. On Christmas Day 1648 Earle passed sentence of death on several of the ringleaders. Oliver Cromwell, on assuming the protectorate (16 December 1653), appointed Earle one of the counsel to the state, an office which he also held under Richard Cromwell, but he did not figure in any of the state trials of the period. On the Restoration of 1660 he was again called to the degree of serjeant-at-law (22 June 1660) (Siderfin's Reports, 3). His name does not appear much in the reports, but he amassed by his practice a considerable fortune, and founded the county family of Earle of Heydon Hall. He died on 7 September 1667, and was buried in the parish church of Heydon, Norfolk.

Biography Discover the popular Sicilian music by the ensemble of Milazzo, the ancient town of Mylae. Luciano Maio (born in 1950 in Milazzo, Sicily) has been a propagator of Sicilian culture all his life, as a poet, artist, painter, singer, fisherman, sculptor, lyricist, and as a composer. In the early 1970s he founded 'Taberna Mylaensis' and initiated the recovery of the great traditional music of Sicily, on the wave of the student revolts of 1968 with its expectations for social renovation. In the years to follow, 'Taberna Mylaensis' has had various line-ups, with Luciano Maio as its steady centre during which the band released 10 LPs and CDs. The repertoire, which originally focused on protest songs, gradually shifted to a more traditional and contemporary approach. Sicily, the centre of the old Mediterranean world located on the crossroads of trade routes, has been influenced by Normans, Arabs, Greeks, French, Spanish, and the Maghreb culture. The music of Taberna Mylaensis bears traces of all these cultures. Luciano Maio's compositions are based on Sicilian and Mediterranean traditions and his lyrics (written in Sicilian language) often depict historical events. History The Sicilian group Taberna Mylaensis, was found in 1975 in Milazzo (the antique city of Mylae) by Luciano Maio, composer and author of the music and lyrics, with the main purpose to recover the great Sicilian musical heritage which embraces several centuries - from 1500 until 1800 - of chants of labour, rage, protest and religious chants, adapted to the sounds coming from Arabic and African musical traditions. The long history of Taberna can be divided in three periods: * 1975 - 1980: The repertoire consists in traditional songs and music based on research by Alberto Favara, Giuseppe Pitr√® and Leonardo Vigo (end 1800). * 1980 - 1996: Taberna combines its repertoire with new compositions. * 1998‚Äìpresent day: the final phase inaugurated with the release of Taberna's album \\"L 'anima du munnu\\" in 1998 containing lyrics and music composed or re- elaborated exclusively by Luciano Maio. In 1976 Taberna recorded the LP's \\"Fammi ristari\\" and \\"Populi e Santi\\" with record company RCA (now BMG) and the group accompanied Francesco de Gregori as support-act on his national tour. The group participated in various Italian television and radio programmes and a television-special produced by RAI 2 TV entirely dedicated to the group. In 1977 Taberna Mylaensis took part in a popfestival organized by the magazine \\"Re Nudo\\" at Parco Lambro in Milan. In 1978 Taberna tours the Netherlands where they would come back 2 years later to represent Italy on the Winterfolkfestival in Dordrecht and Arnhem. In 1981 Taberna signs a new record deal with Isola CGD and records folk rock LP \\"Gricalata\\". In 1984 Taberna Mylaensis represents Italy on POETRY INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL in Rotterdam and performs in the Istituto Italiano di Cultura (Amsterdam) cultural division of the Italian embassy in the Netherlands. During that time the collaboration with the record company \\"PAN RECORDS\\" producer of world and ethnic music, begins and Taberna's cd's will be distributed around the world. Taberna's new project titled \\"L'Anima du Munnu\\" inspired Luciano Maio to re-elaborate a new poetic way to composing Sicilian popular music, that is not anymore the traditional way but by discovering the Mediterranean culture. Thus the music became ethnic folk music and Taberna received great success with its performance in Istanbul 's C.R.R.Concert Hall in 1998. In 2001 Taberna Mylaensis released the live cd \\"La chiami Sicilia\\" as a celebration of the 25 years of musical activities. In May 2004 Taberna receives the \\"Corrado Maranci\\" award for its contribution to and diffusion of the Sicilian culture and popular music. In June 2004 Taberna Mylaensis releases the new cd \\"E vinniru du mari...Federicu\\", a co-production between Pan Records and the Association Arte Sicilia.

It was ruled by the rajas of Maravar caste who also had the title of Sethupathi. Maravars ruled the Ramnad area as traditional chieftains between 14th to 16th century CE, and in 17th century CE they expanded their power to establish \\"Ramnad Kingdom\\" which is also known as \\"Maravar Kingdom\\", in 1795 CE after the Carnatic wars they were reduced to the status of zamidari by the British raj. After the independence of India in 1947 the estates were merged in the Union of India and in 1949 all rulers lost the ruling rights, privy purse was also finally abolished in 1971. The seat of administration was the town of Ramanathapuram. The Zamindari had its origins in the Kingdom of Ramnad established by Raghunatha Kilavan in the late 17th century. In 1803, the Kingdom was converted to a Zamindari by the British. The male rulers of Ramnathapuram also bore the title of Sethupathi or \\"protector of the bridge\\", the bridge here referring to the legendary (Adam's Bridge) Rama's Bridge while female rulers bore the title \\"Nachiyar\\". Ramnad Dynasty Front View Build by Raghunatha Kilavan Ramalinga Vilasam  History  The estate of Ramnad included the Hindu holy island city of Rameswaram, from where, legend has it that the Hindu god Rama launched his invasion of Ravana's Lanka. On the conclusion of the war and Rama's success in it, he appointed a Sethupathi or \\"lord of the bridge\\" to guard the way to the island. The \\"bridge\\" referred to here is the legendary Adam's Bridge or Rama's Bridge which was believed to have been constructed by Rama. The chieftains of Ramnad were entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the bridge, hence the appellation.  14th-16th century CE: As traditional Maravar chieftains  During the 14th and 15th centuries, the traditional chieftain Raghunatha Kilavan of the region who belonged to the Maravar caste was officially recognised as Sethupathi by the Nayak king of Madurai. The chieftain of Ramnad, in return, recognised the sovereignty of the Nayak king over his lands. When the power of the Nayak kings of Madurai began to decline in the late 17th century, the chieftains of Ramnad asserted their independence.  17th-19th century CE: Rise as Ramnad Kingdom or Maravar Kingdom  In the late 17th century, Raghunatha Kilavan crowned himself king of Ramnad and changed his seat from Pogalur to Ramnad close to the east coast. He ruled from 1673 to 1708 and oversaw the growth of the feudal chieftainship of Ramnad into powerful \\"Kingdom of Ramnad\\" which is known as \\"Maravar Kingdom\\". He erected massive fortifications to protect his capital. In 1725, the king of Tanjore claimed the northern part of the Ramnad kingdom (the Aranthangi region) up to the river Pambar in return for his services during the civil war in Ramnad. A vassal of Ramnad who was amongst the victors in the civil war took over the westerly located Sivaganga region, thereby leaving only three-fifths of the kingdom actually in the hands of the king of Ramnad.  19th-20th century CE: reduced to zamidari jagir during British Raj  Ramnad participated in the Carnatic wars between the British and the French East India companies. The state came under British influence in the 1790s and the king of Ramnad was deposed in 1795 for misrule. The British, then, made the king's sister the ruler of Ramnad and deprecated the kingdom to a zamindari by a permanent sanad granting them jagir of Ramnad in 1803. Since then, until the India's independence in 1947, Ramnad was ruled by the queen and her descendants. Raja Bhaskara Sethupathi, who lived in the late 19th century, borrowed large amounts of money from Nagarathar creditors for construction of irrigation works and massive developments projects and for charitable purposes that he soon ran into heavy debt. In 1895, most of the estate was pledged to the creditors who set up a trust for its administration and maintenance. Bhaskara Sethupathi's successors actively supported the Justice Party. Shanmugha Rajeswara Sethupathi was an active supporter of the Justice Party and promoted the Self-Respect Movement. After the independence of India in 1947, the Government of India marged estates, jagiirs, kingdom with the Union of India. COnsequently, in 1949 all rulers lost the ruling rights. In 1971, privy purse, an allowance given to the former rulers, was also ablloished , thus ending all entitlements.

From 1267 to 1290 he was Bishop-Elect of the Bishopric of Utrecht (, ) as John I. He did not care much for his spiritual functions, and his government also failed due to his weak political and poor financial management. During his reign, the influence of the County of Holland in the Bishopric greatly increased. John's government was one of the worst the Bishopric had to endure; without talent and energy, slavishly surrendering to all sensual pleasures, it was never possible for him to maintain the inner peace, under which the Nedersticht in particular suffered greatly.Wenzelburger (1881).  Biography  John was the sixth son of Count Henry II of Nassau and Matilda of Guelders and Zutphen, the youngest daughter of Count Otto I of Guelders and Zutphen and Richardis of Bavaria. John is first mentioned in a charter from 1247. From 1262 to 1265, he was archdeacon of Condroz. Under the influence of his cousin Count Otto II of Guelders, John was elected successor to Henry I van Vianden in 1267 as Bishop of Utrecht.Jansen (1982). As Pope Clement IV (at the instigation of the Archbishop of Cologne) disagreed with this choice, John was never ordained a Bishop and remained Bishop-Elect. For this reason he joined Otto II of Guelders at his war against the Archbishop of Cologne, but John could not offer his cousin essential help. For a year after his election, marauding gangs of insurgents from North-Holland, who furiously resisted their nobles, destroyed many castles and finally appeared before the city Utrecht, which they obtained with the help of the poorters, so that John first had to flee to Guelders and then to the Oversticht. When the marauders withdrew from Utrecht in 1268, the townspeople, whom he besieged with assistance of Guelders, refused him entrance, so that he was forced to move his seat to Deventer until 1270. With the help of Otto II of Guelders and Zweder of Beusichem, he again took possession of Amersfoort and Utrecht, but in order to restore order he needed the help of Count Floris V of Holland, who took this opportunity to create a decisive influence on the Bishopric from that moment on. With the death of Otto II of Guelders in 1271, John lost his most important supporter. In the west of the Bishopric, the Lords of Amstel and the Lords of Woerden sought an autonomous position between Holland and the Bishopric, they opportunistically accepted any help. In 1274 Gijsbrecht IV of Amstel saw an opportunity to defeat John definitively in the uprising of the peasants from Kennemerland, Waterland and West-Frisia. Gijsbrecht placed himself at the head of the rebels and went with them to the city Utrecht, where they brought the guilds to power. Then the rebels withdrew. John asked Floris V to recapture the city and restore the former form of government. Marshal Zweder of Beusichem's attempt to conquer the city succeeded in September 1276. He attacked at dawn, and after heavy street fights the city fell into his hands.De Graaf (1996), p. 85-87. John had fled to Deventer and could return to Utrecht. Two years later there again was unrest in the city, after which Nicholas of Kats, a nobleman from Zeeland, at the request of Floris V, took the city again. In the meantime, however, John had become so burdened with debts that in 1276 he had to pledge the castles of Vreeland, Montfoort and Ter Horst ‚Äì which actually had to defend the borders of the Bishopric ‚Äì to his vassals: Vreeland Castle to Gijsbrecht IV of Amstel, Montfoort Castle to Herman VI of Woerden, and Castle Ter Horst to John I of Cuijk.Cordfunke (2013), p. 51.John I of Cuijk was married to John of Nassau's sister, Jutta of Nassau. This made the Bishop-Elect powerless and he urgently needed money. In 1278 he therefore seized the proceeds of the tithes for the crusade from the Dominican convent in Utrecht, which earned him the everlasting hatred of the ecclesiastical authorities. Jan called in the help of Floris V, who financially helped the elect in 1278 in order to be able to repay the pledge. Floris V agreed with the city council of Utrecht on 5 September 1278 that he would govern the city with a mixed council. At the pledge in 1276, Gijsbrecht IV of Amstel had stipulated that he only had to return Vreeland Castle one year after the repayment of the pledge. However, when Gijsbrecht still refused to transfer Vreeland Castle to John in the beginning of 1280, the elect first tried, in vain, to capture Vreeland Castle by military means. Floris V then besieged Vreeland Castle in May 1280 and took Gijsbrecht prisoner. Floris V then moved to Montfoort Castle and conquered that too. In January 1281 Floris V presented John the bill for the acts of war: 4000 pounds for Amstelland and 2000 pounds for Woerden. Because John did not have that amount, he pledged these areas to Floris V, who thereby considerably increased his control in Utrecht. John did retain some power in the Oversticht because Count Reginald I of Guelders was mainly concerned with the War of the Limburg Succession. In 1288, when John undertook the rebuilding of the St. Martin's Cathedral in Utrecht, which had burned down in 1248, he gave visitors a 180-day indulgence.Bredero (1982). In 1290 John was deposed by Pope Nicholas IV on the basis of a whole list of allegations; they do not seem to have been of a moral nature.Milis (1982). John settled in Deventer, where he died on 13 July, 1309. He was buried in the Lebuinus Church there.  Descendants  John fathered four illegitimate children, the name of the mother is unknown: # John of Nassau (killed in action in front of the Nordenberghepoort at Zwolle, 4 June 1352). He married first to Frieda van Appeldoorn (‚Ä† 4 July 1350) and second to Ermgard ter Oy (listed on 4 June 1352). # Jacob of Nassau (‚Ä† 21 March after 1340). He married to a certain Nenta (listed as widow in 1350). From this marriage: ## Everhard of Nassau (‚Ä† 7 December 1390). He was canon in Deventer in 1350 and vicar in the Lebuinus Church in Deventer. # Otto (listed in Deventer in 1320). # Matilda (‚Ä† Deventer, 1350). She was married to J. Vrijherte.

The 2009 Nakumatt supermarket fire occurred when a supermarket in downtown Nairobi, Kenya, caught fire on 28 January 2009. Twenty-nine remains have thus far been located in the rubble of the destroyed Nakumatt supermarket, with police investigating a tip that security guards locked exit doors in an effort to prevent looting. However the locking of the doors on the ground floor had no effect on the victims, as they were all found on the floor above. The fire allegedly started near the only staircase accessible to the public, trapping the victims in the shop. One other man died after leaping from the building to escape the flames. Forty-seven people are still missing. The bodies of the dead are \\"charred beyond recognition\\". Official reports say one person died in hospital from injuries brought on by poisonous fumes and injuries sustained in the inferno but another 39 were unaccounted for and were officially reported as \\"missing\\". The emergency services have been criticised for what the Kenyan media view as an inadequate response to the blaze. Following the blaze, the Daily Nation reported that Nairobi's three million inhabitants were served only by one fire station situated close to a traffic-choked business district. Although it happened on 28 January, it was not widely reported across the world until two days later when the full scale of the fire was recognised.  Inferno  The fire began on 28 January 2009, a Wednesday afternoon, when the Woolworths Building which housed Nakumatt Downtown Nairobi caught fire at 3:00 PM. The blaze was still being fought twenty-four hours later. A power transformer had earlier blown and there were reports that gas cylinders on sale at the supermarket and chemicals at a hardware shop in the neighbouring Alibhai Shariff Building had fueled the inferno. Members of the public helped to fight the blaze which ensued. Thousands of people were evacuated from their offices in downtown Nairobi as plumes of black smoke were sent into the sky overhead. The smoke forced the evacuation of some nearby buildings, with police employing whips, horses and teargas to beat back curious crowds. One man died after leaping from an upper floor of the burning supermarket, whilst one other man, Nakumatt employee Jeremiah Omoyo, also leaped off the roof to escape the blaze but survived. Another Nakumatt employee told Kenya's The Standard newspaper that the crowd were encouraging the trapped customers and employees to jump. The Kenyan media has criticised the emergency response, claiming that firefighters arrived late and in inadequate numbers. Daily Nation, the largest newspaper in Kenya, remarked on the way the fire was handled and responded to by saying, \\"It is fair to say that ours is a modern city with an 18th century fire- fighting infrastructure.\\" The City Council Fire Brigade were helped by 2 private companies with fire engines - G4S and Knight Support.

His practice was primarily focused on public buildings, particularly courthouses and legislative buildings, although he also designed railroad stations, commercial buildings, schools and residences. Milburn was a native of Bowling Green, Kentucky who practiced as an architect in Louisville from 1884 to 1889; Kenova, West Virginia 1890-1895; Charlotte, North Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina; and Washington, D.C. after 1904. From 1902 Milburn was architect for the Southern Railway. Milburn pioneered a new approach to the marketing of architectural services, publishing sponsored books of his work, placing advertisements in trade publications, entering competitions and moving his office to suit available opportunities.Bryan, John Morrill: Creating the South Carolina State House, page 116. University of South Carolina Press, 1999 . This resulted in work in every Southern state apart from Mississippi. Columbia County Courthouse (Columbia County, Florida) Milburn was particularly successful in obtaining commissions for significant public buildings, ranging from county courthouses to state capitols. Milburn did significant work at the South Carolina State House and the old Florida State Capitol, and unsuccessfully competed for work on the Arkansas Capitol. In 1902, Milburn did design upgrade for the Florida State Capitolhttps://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/24593 and designed Columbia County Courthouse in Lake City, Florida. That same year he also designed the Blanche Hotel across the street from the courthouse. South Carolina State House Milburn won a 1900 competition to complete the South Carolina State House over William Augustus Edwards and Charles Coker Wilson, as well as Gadsen E. Shand, an assistant to former State House architect Frank Niernsee. Milburn's selection was made easier by the fact that the proposed cost for his design was the least expensive of those submitted. Plans and specifications were issued and bids accepted, but a dispute broke out immediately over differences between the competition design and that issued for bidding. Milburn had reduced the number of columns on the north portico by six and had removed a line of columns on the south portico to remain within the appropriated budget. Other changes to the dome and disputes over the quantity and accuracy of details and the quality of the work caused legal and political difficulties, but the project proceeded. Milburn, however, moved to Washington when his work with the Southern Railway offered the opportunity. Gibbs Museum of Art in Charleston, South Carolina In Washington Once in Washington, Milburn teamed with Michael Heister (1909 - 1934) to form the firm of Milburn and Heister. Milburn's son, Thomas Y. Milburn, joined the firm in 1914 and took over the firm a year before his father's death in 1926. Work *W.

Starring Els Dottermans, Matthias Schoenaerts and Veerle Baetens. Plot Dennis (Matthias Schoenaerts) is 26 years old but has the mind of a child. He is obsessed with trains and train schedules. His mother Rita (Els Dottermans) is filled with joy when Dennis returns from prison after serving a sentence for the alleged rape of an underage girl. The neighborhood, however, is not happy with Dennis‚Äô homecoming especially Barbara (Veerle Baetens). After Dennis masturbates at the playground - with his pants on - Rita and his father Andr√© (Damiaan De Schrijver) decide to keep him inside. However, when Rita is at her work, Andr√© is watching Dennis but falls asleeps. In this timeframe, Dennis goes outside to see the trains but does not return. Later on the evening, the police brings them a visit telling Dennis raped a woman (Maaike Neuville). Dennis is found in a train station. Dennis is being interrogated by an alienist. He concludes there is no proper psychiatric institution where Dennis can be handled, so he is sent to jail whilst he is in custody. There he is frequently seriously beaten up and pestered. The prison officers do not take action when this happens and are even amused to see the fights. These harassments lead to a failed suicide attempt. Rita contacts Thomas (Tom Van Dyck), a lawyer who coincidentally happens to be the new boyfriend of Barbara. A medical examination proved the girl was indeed raped by Dennis. Thomas thinks Dennis does not belong in prison but must be sent to a psychiatric institution and gives his services for free. So he must convince the judge. Barbara changes her mind after a quarrel with Thomas. She initially hoped Rita and her family would move or Dennis is locked up forever, but never realized Dennis does need professional help. They try to convince the government with a petition and are able to get talktime in a famous Belgian debate television show. Some days later, Rita gets a letter from a psychiatric institution which will give Dennis shelter. There, Dennis tells the girl took him to an abandoned place as she claimed to know all about trains and schedules. She told she was cold so he gave her his sweater. Next, she stroked multiple times on his belly. He told her she must not do that as it is forbidden. As she kept going on and looked at him very nicely, he pushed the girl away. She hit a pillar and became unconscious. Dennis thought she was dead and removed the sweater. Thereby he felt her warm belly which eventually lead to the raping. The trial and judgment are not revealed.

During the 1948 Palestine War (1947‚Äì1949), Israel's diplomatic mission in Washington received information that Pakistan was trying to provide military assistance to the Arabs, including rumors that a Pakistani battalion would be sent to Palestine to fight alongside them. Pakistan bought 250,000 rifles in Czechoslovakia that apparently were meant for the Arabs. Also, it became known that Pakistan bought three planes in Italy for the Egyptians.Moshe Yegar, \\"Pakistan and Israel\\", Jewish Political Studies Review 19:3‚Äì4 (Fall 2007) The Pakistan Air-Force participated in the 1967 and 1973 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli wars, Pakistani pilots flying Jordanian and Syrian planes downed some Israeli planes, whereas in the 1982 battle for Beirut between Israel and the PLO, fifty Pakistani volunteers serving in the PLO were taken prisoner by Israel. After the 1973 war, Pakistan and the PLO signed an agreement for training PLO officers in Pakistani military institutions.Mushahid Hussain, \\"How Pakistan Views Israel and the Palestinians\\", Middle East International, September 1988, 21; P. R. Kumaraswamy, Beyond the Veil: Israel‚ÄìPakistan Relations (Tel Aviv: Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, Tel Aviv University, 2000), 34 Pakistan and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had developed close ties. The PLO was first recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians at an Islamic summit in Lahore in February 1974. This was approved six months later at an Arab summit in Rabat. PLO missions in Karachi and Islamabad (Pakistan's capital since 1960) received full diplomatic recognition in 1975. Also in 1975, Pakistan had supported and voted in favor of UN General Assembly Resolution 3379 which had equated Zionism with racism (the resolution was later revoked with Resolution 4686 but Pakistan voted against revoking it). During the First Intifada that began in 1987, pro-PLO rallies were held in Pakistan and the government sent the organization food and medical supplies.Moshe Yegar, \\"Pakistan and Israel,\\" Jewish Political Studies Review 19:3-4 (Fall 2007) After the Palestinian Declaration of Independence on November 15, 1988, Pakistan then recognized the Palestinian Authority on 16 November 1988 and had established full diplomatic relations with it by the end of 1989. Bilateral visits The Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, also paid an official visit to Pakistan in 2005, during his tour of Asia. During his stay in Islamabad, he met Pervez Musharraf who was the President of Pakistan at that time as well as the then-Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and Senate Chairman of Pakistan, Muhammad Mian Soomro. In the meeting, he made political talks with the Pakistani leaders regarding the current situation of the Middle East and the peace process between Palestinian Authority and Israel. He also discussed about the developments in the occupied territories and the international efforts exerted so far to attain peace in the region, and to implement related agreements in addition to the support Pakistan provides to Palestinian Authority.Bahrain News Agency When leaving Pakistan, Abbas said that he supports the right to self- determination of the Palestinians and the solidarity of the Arab World with the Pakistanis against the Israeli occupation of Palestine, Abbas thanked Musharraf and the people of Pakistan for their continued and devoted support to the Palestinian cause.Daily Times - Leading News Resource of Pakistan Relations with Hamas After the January 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf called on the world to accept the choice and reality of the Palestinian people and must not shut the doors to the Palestinian people.CRS Report for Congress The Palestinian Foreign Minister Mahmoud al-Zahar paid a visit to Pakistan in June 2006 and thanked Pakistan for supporting the rights of the Palestinian people.

President Asif Ali Zardari further said Israel's air raids on Gaza Strip have \\"violated the Charter of United Nations\\". He also urged the entire world to take swift action of Israel's raids on Gaza as it was as open violation of UN Charter.Israel raids on Gaza violate U.N charter: Zardari - GEO.tv .Geo.tv. Retrieved on 2009-01-08 On January 11, the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, Hussain Haroon, called for an immediate ceasefire and calm. He criticised Israel saying the unrestrained use of force, scale of destruction, killing of innocent civilians, including women and children, the violation of UN safe havens, and the collective punishment of an entire people were blatant breaches of international law. He said that those act, in their totality, constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity. He also called for the end of Israel's blockade in Gaza. Also during the 2008-2009 Israel- Gaza conflict, Pakistan's GEO News was one of the only few foreign news channels that provided exclusive coverage of the situation that was prevailing after the war, right from Gaza. The reporting was hosted by the Pakistani journalist, Hamid Mir, in January 2009. After the Gaza flotilla raid on May 31, 2010, Pakistan strongly condemned the Israeli action, calling it a cruel act and an open violation of international laws and ethics. Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi stated that \\"Pakistan strongly condemns this incident. Our point of view was that there was no moral or legal reason for this attack\\". The Pakistani government also expressed deep concern over the well- being of Pakistanis and journalists on board and Pakistani missions are in touch with Arab countries of the region to get information about the status of the Pakistani nationals in the flotilla. President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister of Pakistan Yousuf Raza Gilani strongly condemned the Israeli actions. They further said that the Government of Pakistan is exerting all its efforts to find out what had happened to the Pakistanis aboard the flotilla. Among the people who were aboard the Gaza flotilla ship and arrested by Israeli forces during that time was Pakistani journalist Syed Talat Hussain with his producer. He was the only Pakistani journalist that time who traveled with the flotilla and garnered wide attention in Pakistani media. During the November 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense in the Gaza Strip, the Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf spoke to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and said that Pakistan strongly condemns Israeli air attacks in Gaza \\"that have targeted not only the Hamas leadership but also innocent civilians\\". He said Pakistan considers Israeli action as \\"a grave violation of international law and all humanitarian norms\\". He added that Israeli threats of a ground offensive against Gaza were even more disturbing. Raja also said that unless the Palestinian problem was resolved, peace in the Middle East would remain elusive. He expressed concern that the escalation in violence could lead to a spreading of conflict, which may engulf the region. On 14 April 2012, Pakistani Delegation led by Allma Qazi Norani, Sabir Karbali, Hasnat Qadri, Arsalan Ayaz others participated in a Global road Caravan towards Jerusalem. On November 29, 2012, Pakistan voted in favor of UN General Assembly Resolution 67/19 Palestine to non-member observer state status in the United Nations. UN General Assembly Resolution 67/19 During the 2014 Israel- Gaza conflict, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said: \\"I am saddened and disappointed to note the silence of international community against this injustice, the silence and ineffectiveness of the Muslim Ummah has made Palestinians more vulnerable and made Israel more aggressive. The world must stop Israel from this naked and brutal aggression\\".He termed the Israeli atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza as ‚Äògenocide,‚Äô urging the world to stop Israel‚Äôs naked and brutal aggression. In his Independence Day speech Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said Israeli atrocities on Gaza citizens were no lesser a tragedy. He said the bombardment on human settlements and massacre of innocent people was a moment of thought for the world community as well as the human conscience. He said: ‚ÄúPakistan strongly condemns it. The civilized world must take cognisance of the situation because it was a tragedy for the whole humanity.‚Äù See also * Foreign relations of Pakistan * Israel‚ÄìPakistan relations ReferencesExternal links * State visit: Palestinian president to meet Zardari today Palestinian Authority Bilateral relations of the State of Palestine ","title":"Pakistan‚ÄìPalestine relations"},{"id":"21323883","text":"This is a list of the complete squads for the 2009 Six Nations Championship, an annual rugby union tournament contested by the national rugby teams of England, France, Ireland, Italy Scotland, and Wales.

Prop Matt Stevens was replaced in the squad by Julian White after Stevens was found to have taken a banned substance. Flanker Lewis Moody broke his ankle while training with his club, Leicester Tigers, and was replaced in the England squad by Steffon Armitage, brother of full back Delon Armitage. Andy Goode, Joe Worsley and Paul Hodgson were all called up to train with the squad and went on to take part in the tournament. While Louis Deacon and Olly Barkley replaced the injured Tom Palmer and Shane Geraghty in the squad.

Maxime Mermoz was called up in place of the banned Florian Fritz. Renaud Boyoud was also drafted in place of the injured Beno√Æt Lecouls. Mathieu Bastareaud was called up for the injured Lionel Beauxis with Beno√Æt Baby moving to fly-half, while Sylvain Marconnet was brought into the squad after injuries to both Beno√Æt Lecouls and Nicolas Mas.

After Bergamasco's shocking performance at scrum-half in the opener against England, in which his mistakes directly led to three of England's five tries, Mallett recalled Paul Griffen to play scrum-half and moved Bergamasco back to his normal flanker position. Carlo Del Fava was also brought in as an experienced second row forward. Leonardo Ghiraldini was called up after he recovered from injury but Fabio Ongaro was ruled out, so Franco Sbaraglini was also called up. On 3 March, Mallett added several players to the squad.

D. Wilson, Nineteenth- Century Colorado Cartographer\\", Colorado Heritage, no. 4, pages 22-33, 1988 was an American cartographer. Biography He was born in Sparta, Illinois. He left school and in March 1867, enlisted with the Geological Survey of California. There he learned triangulation. In July 1868, he joined Clarence King for his Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel and stayed with him through 1872. In 1872, Wilson accompanied King and others to investigate and eventually debunk a diamond hoax in the northwest corner of the Colorado Territory. Wilson then joined Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, and between 1873 and 1878 he led a survey party across western Colorado, western Wyoming, and eastern Idaho. Wilson's half-brother Franklin Rhoda was a key member of this survey team. tIn 1879, Hayden's Survey was merged with others to form the U.S. Geological Survey. Clarence King named Wilson the chief topographer of the USGS. Wilson resigned from the USGS on September 30, 1881, in order to become chief topographer for the Northern Transcontinental Survey, organized by Raphael Pumpelly. Henry Villard, president of the Northern Pacific Railroad, had invited Pumpelly to map a route through the territories of Washington, Idaho, and Montana and to identify the economic resources near the railroad lines.

He is most notable for his time spent in Britain after 1701, when he served as an advisor to several British monarchs. Early career Bothmer was a member of the household Sophia Dorothea, wife of George the son and heir of the Ernest Augustus, Duke of Hanover while George was taking part in the Siege of Vienna in 1683.Hatton p.49 He rose in the service of the family, elevated after 1692 from Dukes to Electors of Hanover, performing a series of diplomatic missions.Hatton p.96 and in 1701 he was appointed as the Hanoverian envoy in London. The Act of Settlement established that following Queen Anne, the crown should pass to her nearest Protestant relations. This meant the distant Hanoverian branch of the family rather than her Catholic half-brother James Stuart, the Jacobite claimant. He was appointed an Imperial Baron in 1696, and was known in London as Baron von Bothmer even after he was elevated to the title of Imperial Count in 1713.K√∂hler & Wolschke-Bulmahn p.152 Envoy in London He grew to be a confidante of the British Queen Anne, and after her death in 1714, he spent his time burning her secret correspondence so that it would not fall into the hands of her enemies.Simms p.80 He was by this time a popular figure in British political society, and counted both Tories and Whigs amongst his friends.Simms p.83-84 Hanoverian Succession In 1714, he was instrumental in securing the succession of the Hanoverian King George I to the throne, rather than the rival Jacobite claimant James III & VIII who possessed an arguably stronger blood claim. In spite of this, he experienced a surprisingly turbulent relationship with the new King, and for a while he fell out of favour. In these years, he conspired with Robert Walpole, a British politician, who had also been excluded from power. In 1719 he was one of the original backers of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company which commissioned numerous works from Handel, Bononcini and others.Thomas McGeary. The Politics of Opera in Handel's Britain.

During the Second World War she created a large-scale multiple choice Rorschach test. She was one of the first clinical psychologists to open a private practice. Specializing in diagnostics, Harrower developed a scale allowing practitioners to predict which patients would profit from psychotherapy. Family and early life Molly Harrower was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the daughter of James, a banker, and Ina (n√©e White) Harrower. Her Scottish-born parents were visiting South Africa when she was born and the family returned to the United Kingdom while she was an infant. Their home was in Cheam, a village south of London. Molly Harrower had one brother, who was three years younger. From the age of ten she attended the Godolphin School in Salisbury where she excelled at sports, particularly cricket. Education After leaving the Godolphin School Harrower was sent to a finishing school in Paris. She was unhappy with the school environment so her parents sent her to live with a family while learning French in Switzerland for a year. In 1925, with the help of a family friend, she was admitted to Bedford College's journalism program despite having no academic qualifications. After auditing a psychology course taught by Beatrice Edgell, who became a mentor to her, Harrower switched to a program leading to an academic diploma in psychology. She did not complete the three- year program, being forced to leave after two years because of her family's financial difficulties. She then spent four months in France on a scholarship to study painting and dancing before returning to England, where she worked as an assistant to C.K. Ogden, mainly in his capacity as a book dealer in Cambridge. Ogden recommended her to his friend the Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka, who directed the psychology laboratory at Smith College in Massachusetts. Smith College granted her a fellowship and she began working with Koffka in 1928. On the invitation of Beatrice Edgell she returned to Bedford College in 1932 as a temporary senior lecturer, filling in for one year after the accidental death of her former teacher Victoria Hazlitt. Under Koffka's supervision she earned a PhD in 1934 for a dissertation entitled Organization in Higher Mental Processes. Hers was the first psychology doctorate awarded by Smith College. The external examiners were George Humphrey, Edwin Boring, and Arnold Gesell. Career=Research= Harrower became interested in clinical psychology when she observed major changes in a friend's personality after surgery. The Rockefeller Foundation granted her a three-year post-doctoral fellowship, which she took up in 1937, to study \\"the psychological effects of surgical operations, the impact of surgical shock\\" at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). In order to become familiar with the hospital setting she first spent six months working with Kurt Goldstein at the Montefiore Hospital in New York. At the MNI she worked with Wilder Penfield, and was involved as a psychologist in the pioneering neural stimulation studies that led to the development of the Montreal procedure for treating epilepsy. Early in the Second World War, Harrower received a grant from the Canadian National Research Council to develop a large-scale Rorschach test. The group test was used to screen military recruits based on their responses when shown a standard series of inkblot designs. The subjects were given a list of possible interpretations from which to choose and a high number of \\"neurotic\\" choices was seen as necessitating a \\"psychiatric check- up\\". This allowed the Rorschach to be given to large groups in as little as 15 minutes, in comparison to the normally administered Rorschach that could take an hour per individual.Harrower-Erickson, M. R., & Steiner, M. E. (1945). Large scale Rorschach techniques: A manual for the group Rorschach and Multiple Choice Test. The Multiple Choice Rorschach attracted a flurry of attention in the few years after. The test was ultimately found to be of little value, though. In 1941 Harrower moved from Montreal to Madison, Wisconsin where her husband, neurosurgeon Theodore Erickson, had obtained a position at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison medical school. She received funding from the Macy Foundation to continue developing and training psychologists in the use of large-scale Rorschach tests. She also worked as a consultant to the United States Army and Air Force as well as the United States Department of State. Harrower was a founding core member of the series of Macy conferences on cybernetics, attending the first five meetings until her resignation in 1949. =Clinical practice= Harrower opened a private practice in New York City in 1945, one of the first clinical psychologists to do so. She specialized in psychodiagnostic testing of medical patients referred to her by psychiatrists, neurologists and other physicians, using the Rorschach test as her primary tool. During the course of her practice she used her diagnostic techniques on over 1,600 patients, keeping records of each consultation, and followed up with the treating therapists to develop a scale predicting the likelihood of successful therapy. The result was published in 1965 in Psychodiagnostic Testing: An Empirical Approach. After undergoing psychoanalysis herself from 1944 to 1946 she extended her practice to include psychotherapy. Among her innovative techniques was poetry therapy, about which she published a book, The Therapy of Poetry, in 1972. She also did consulting work for organizations such as the Children‚Äôs Court of Manhattan, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Unitarian-Universalist Church. She taught at the New School for Social Research from 1963 to 1968. Harrower was president of the New York Society of Clinical Psychologists in 1952-53. She worked on the development of a certification program for New York State psychologists. =University of Florida= Harrower left New York and joined the faculty of the University of Florida in Gainesville in 1967, teaching clinical psychology. She retired at the age of 70 and was named an emeritus professor in 1975. In 1972 she was awarded the Bruno Klopfer Award by the Society for Personality Assessment. The University of Florida made her an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in March 1981. She established the Molly Harrower Women's Golf Endowment at the University of Florida. =Publications= Harrower's publications include 20 books and more than 100 articles and book chapters. Among these were four books of poetry, the first of which, Plain Jane, was a book of children's poems published in 1929. In 1983 she published a selection of her correspondence with Kurt Koffka dating from 1930 until his death in 1941. In 1976 Harrower published a notable article based on the examination of records of Rorschach tests administered to Nazi war criminals immediately after the Second World War. She found that they did not show any common personality type, and that some appeared to be psychologically normal. Based on this conclusion, she cautioned that \\"well- integrated, productive and secure personalities are no protection against being sucked into a vortex of myth and deception, which may ultimately erupt into the commitment of horror on a grand scale\\". This research led to her collaboration on a book published in 1995 entitled The Quest for the Nazi Personality: A Psychological Investigation of Nazi War Criminals. Personal life Molly Harrower was married twice and had no children. Her first husband was Theodore Erickson, a neurosurgeon whom she met while working at the Montreal Neurological Institute. They were married in 1938 and were divorced in 1944. During their marriage she published under the name Harrower-Erickson. She married Mortimer Lahm, a businessman, in 1955. Lahm died in 1967. After her retirement Harrower continued to live in Gainesville. She died at home on 20 February 1999.

His father, Sukraj Bhavanani, was a High court Advocate in the Patna High Court and an extensive landowner. His mother Leelavathi was converted to Hinduism through the Arya Samaj rites. Yogamaharishi received his early schooling at home from his mother. Tragically, his mother died when he was but eight years of age. When he was ten years, his Guru, the great Siddha and Master, Yogamaharishi Swami Kanakananda Bhrigu, (Ram Gopal Majumdar) entered his life. For six years, he studied in the Guru Kula of his Master, imbibing not only the traditional education, but also the great mystic sciences of Yoga, Tantra and Yantra. When he was sixteen years of age, his Guru sent him to England to study medicine. After receiving his medical degree, he entered the British Royal Navy to serve as a doctor on board several ships during World War II. He was injured during the war, and used the time recuperating to further his medical education. He migrated to Canada and set up his practice there, also establishing Yoga schools and centres wherever he lived. Pujya Swamiji was one of the pioneers to introduce Yoga to the Western mind in the early 1950s. He was also instrumental in hosting many visiting Yoga Gurus and Swamijis at his centre in Vancouver.

History Gulab Bagh, also known as Sajjan Niwas Garden, was built by Maharana fateh Singh in the 1887. It is the fourth oldest zoo in the semi- continent. It spans across 66 acres of land, and is hailed as one of the most beautiful and largest garden in Rajasthan. By Maharana's volition, a horticulturist from Madras, T.H.

A small pond existed in the garden before it was demolished for the construction of Water works complex. In this pond a water lily, Victoria sp., was initially planted. The leaf of Victoria could withstand a child on a chair kept on it, a property common to all the water- lilies of the genus due to plant's structure. The Garden draws it name as Gulab Bagh due to the presence of a ranch where variety roses can be found in abundance. The garden was also called Bada Bagh but the name dropped has out of popular use. Maharana Sajjan Singh placed the foundation stone of the Victoria museum(now called Saraswati Bhawan Library) in the garden on 2 November 1890. It was inaugurated by Lord Lansdown. Mr. Gauri Shankar Ojha was the first curator of this museum appointed in the year 1890. The museum had many rare artefacts and stone manuscripts dating from 3rd Centaury B.C. to 17th Centaury A.D.

Pre-season On 12 June, having spent three years at Liverpool and missing only six matches, 29-year-old goalkeeper Tommy Younger was allowed to leave to take on a player-manager role at Scottish Second Division side Falkirk. In exchange, Liverpool signed Falkirk's 23-year- old goalkeeper Bert Slater. Slater had made 134 appearances for Falkirk, winning a Scottish Cup winners medal in the process, before the club were relegated at the end of the 1958-59 season. Slater was small for a goalkeeper standing at just and was nicknamed 'Shorty' but he was immediately put into the Liverpool goal upon his arrival. There were promotions to the first-team for local-born 22-year-old defender John Nicholson and 18-year-old inside forward Willie Carlin - the latter a promising youngster who had represented his country at schoolboy and youth levels; 19-year-old full back Alan Jones, a Welsh schoolboy international who had signed professional forms for Liverpool two years earlier; Wrexham-born forward Reginald Blore who had risen through the junior ranks at Anfield; 17-year-old midfielder Ian Callaghan from Toxteth, considered by Liverpool legend Billy Liddell to be his successor; and 20-year-old striker Roger Hunt, signed a year earlier by Phil Taylor when he was brought to his attention playing for Stockton Heath. Taylor resigned as manager on 17 November and was succeeded by Bill Shankly on 14 December.

Of Transportation NG9-1-1 initiative This NG9-1-1 infrastructure is intended to replace the current services over time. The National Emergency Number Association (NENA) first identified the need for NG9-1-1 in 2000, and started development actions in 2003, and is nearing full definition and standards for NG9-1-1. Since 2006, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) in the United States and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in Canada have been leading their respective initiatives, which include research and development projects aimed at advancing NG9-1-1.Mission Critical Magazine: \\"Greater Expectations\\"\\"T9-1-1 CRTC INTERCONNECTION STEERING COMMITTEE REPORT\\" On January 24, 2013, the CRTC announced the first step toward a Canadian implementation of NG9-1-1\\"CRTC announces enhancements to 911 services for Canadians with hearing or speech impairments\\" and, in March 2016, began a consultation with the public to discuss what services should be offered, who will play a role in offering these services and how these services should be paid for.\\"CRTC reviewing next- generation 9-1-1 services\\" Several US states have implemented versions of NG9-1-1, as of October 2013. Purpose and history Planning for NG9-1-1 started in 2000 and was published in NENA's Future Path Plan in 2001. NENA's NG9-1-1 Project began in 2003 and continues to an ultimate goal of establishing national NG9-1-1 architecture and operations standards, and implementation plans to accomplish advanced 9-1-1 systems and services. Public safety communications experts recognized that the nation's current 9-1-1 system was not capable of handling the text, data, images and video that are increasingly common in personal communications. The stated goal of a related USDOT project is: \\"To enable the general public to make a 9-1-1 ‚Äúcall‚Äù (any real-time communication ‚Äì voice, text, or video) from any wired, wireless, or IP-based device, and allow the emergency services community to take advantage of advanced call delivery and other functions through new internetworking technologies based on open standards.\\"NG9-1-1 Initiative Overview The project is aimed at supporting establishment of a national architecture for an NG9-1-1 system that would meet these goals, and to create a transition plan for NG9-1-1. The \\"Proof of Concept\\" phase of the DOT project, using the architecture designed by NENA, was completed in 2008, and a report was issued on the results of a proof of concept demonstration conducted over the course of that year.NG9-1-1 Proof Of Concept Test Report That report has served as a basic blueprint for planning and implementation of these capabilities. Actual implementation of these capabilities is expected to take several years, and will require changes to existing communications infrastructure, as well as changes to the way PSAPs operate.DOT NG9-1-1 Overview In 2000 Palm Beach County, FL (the largest county east of the Mississippi) implemented the first ESInet in the US. AT&T; connecting multiple PSAPs utilizing the SIP protocol. In 2012, the State of Washington completed the first Statewide ESInet implementation in the US.In 2009, Washington State signed a contract (contract number E09-196) with Qwest Communications to implement a statewide Next Generation 911 ESInet. This implementation was completed with the connection of the last PSAP in April 2012. In 2015 the FCC initiated a nationwide task force. The FCC Task Force on Optimal Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Architecture (Task Force or TFOPA) has been directed to study and report findings and recommendations on structure and architecture in order to determine whether additional consolidation of PSAP infrastructure and architecture improvements would promote greater efficiency of operations, safety of life, and cost containment, while retaining needed integration with local first responder dispatch and support. Enabling technology The NG9-1-1 vision relies on 9-1-1 specific application functionality on an Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) to deliver voice, video, text and data \\"calls\\" to the PSAP. The protocol used for delivering these \\"calls\\" will be the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), or IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS, which incorporates SIP). NENA i3 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT The functional and interface standards developed by NENA describe general SIP and IMS-based architectures that allow responsible 9-1-1 Authorities flexibility in developing an infrastructure to support the envisioned features of NG9-1-1. NENA Functional and Interface Standards for Next Generation 9-1-1 Statutory authorization The 911 Improvement Act of 2008 911 Improvement Act of 2008 requires IP-enabled voice service providers to provide 9-1-1 service, allows state and tribal fees to pay for such services, and directs the Federal Communications Commission to gather information to facilitate these services. The Act also provides for grants to public agencies, and requires the 911 Implementation Coordination Office to develop a national plan for migrating to a national IP-enabled emergency network. Today's 9-1-1 vs. Next Generation 9-1-1 In today's 9-1-1 environment, the public can primarily make only emergency voice calls and Teletype calls (by deaf or hearing impaired persons). Only minimal data is delivered with these calls, such as automatic number identification, subscriber name and Automatic Location Identification, when available. In the Next Generation 9-1-1 environment, the public will be able to make voice, text, or video emergency \\"calls\\" from any communications device via Internet Protocol-based networks. The PSAP of the future will also be able to receive data from personal safety devices such as Advanced Automatic Collision Notification systems, medical alert systems, and sensors of various types. The new infrastructure envisioned by the NG9-1-1 project will support national internetworking of 9-1-1 services, as well as transfer of emergency calls to other PSAPs‚Äîincluding any accompanying data. In addition, the PSAP will be able to issue emergency alerts to wireless devices in an area via voice or text message, and to highway alert systems.Today's 9-1-1 vs. Future 9-1-1 =Example scenarios= *Deaf and hard of hearing people in the U.S. today sometimes use telecommunications devices for the deaf (TTYs or TDDs) or interpreting services to contact 9-1-1. Many deaf people use text messaging and instant messages to communicate with others, but unfortunately, today's 9-1-1 is not equipped to accept these media. This under-serviced demographic accounts for approximately 10% of the general population in Canada and the US (20% of those over 65 and 40% of those over 75).World Health Organization: \\"Global burden of hearing loss\\" In the NG9-1-1 environment, hearing and speech impaired individuals will be able to place such a call by sending a text message from their cell phone. They will be able to carry on a text conversation with 9-1-1 center personnel, and even send pictures or video when necessary.Next Generation 9-1-1 System Preliminary Concept of Operations In 2013, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in Canada, announced the first phase of the country's NG9-1-1 services, implementation of Text with 911 (T911) for the deaf, hard of hearing, and speech impaired community.Cellular News: \\"Canada's Wireless Industry Commends CRTC Decision to Implement Text with 911\\" *In the event of a major highway accident involving multiple vehicles, including a hazardous material vehicle, the local 9-1-1 center may receive many calls from different motorists. This can cause the center to be overloaded with calls, leading to initial confusion of the locations of the multiple crashes. The confusion can delay response times for the necessary equipment and services, which can, in turn, cost lives and delay return to normal traffic flow. In the NG9-1-1 environment, everyone in the vicinity with an Internet-connected device can be automatically notified to avoid the area. Highway message signs, and the 5-1-1 system can also display the warning. Any involved vehicle with an Advanced Automatic Collision Notification system automatically sends important crash data to the 9-1-1 center, which can dispatch emergency responders even if the passengers are unable to respond.NG9-1-1 Examples and Scenarios =Stakeholders and technologies involved= Many pieces of the existing communications and data infrastructure will require modification to make NG9-1-1 a reality. The private companies and public agencies that provide these goods and services will be significantly affected. Chief among these are: *Telecommunications equipment and service providers *Information technology equipment and service providers *Telematics, including Advanced Automatic Collision Notification *Hazmat (Hazardous materials) security alerts to or from commercial motor carriers or rail carriers *Integration of Intelligent transportation systems with public safety communications systems NG9-1-1 technologies *Security alarm notification system providers Other major stakeholders include: *State and local 9-1-1 agencies *Public safety and emergency management agencies *Emergency services industry *Federal departments, including Transportation, Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice and the Federal Communications Commission *National organizations with active interests in 9-1-1 *IT research community *Standards community Major contributors and stakeholders in the standards community include: *Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-Canada (APCO)) *Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO)) *National Emergency Number Association (NENA) *International Academies of Emergency Dispatch (IAED) *Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) *Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) The NENA NG9-1-1 Project and the DOT's NG9-1-1 Initiative look to facilitate the involvement of all these stakeholders going forward in order to develop the architecture and migration plan necessary to make NG9-1-1 a functional reality.NG9-1-1 stakeholder involvement Public network infrastructure impacts In order for a useful connection to be made between the Public Safety Answering Point and person reporting the emergency, a number of changes need to be made to the existing infrastructure. For example, if a user is sending a text message, perhaps with video attached, the data needs to be routed to the PSAP that serves the area where the person is currently, and the location of the wireless device must accompany the message. The person's wireless carrier will receive the message first, then forward the message to the appropriate NG9-1-1 system, which routes to the appropriate PSAP along with the location information. Since several different protocols may be used by the wireless device (SMS or XMPP text messaging, MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) or Wireless Application Protocol for multimedia), translation to a common protocol may be required prior to forwarding. In the case of Advanced Automatic Collision Notification data, the service provider must be able to similarly route this data, along with location data toward the PSAP serving the area where the collision occurred. For the PSAP to be able to send out automatic notifications to all wireless devices currently operating in the area of an emergency, a similar routing mechanism must exist in the opposite (outgoing) direction. Here again, the wireless carrier will be forwarding information.NG9-1-1 Operational Needs PSAP infrastructure impacts=Local PSAP network impacts= A High availability IP infrastructure interface will be needed at the PSAP for it to be able to send and receive all this data. A key element of this will be equipment and software to support IP communications. Internal routing of the emergency communications to the appropriate systems (i.e., text, picture and video data to the Computer-assisted dispatch system, and simultaneously to the communications recording system) will require modifications to the existing PSAP network equipment and software. Some of these changes will be non- trivial. =Local wireless infrastructure impacts= Since some of the emergency communications data will have to be forwarded to field units such as police and fire vehicles, changes will be required to the software running on the terminals that receive the data, and on those that transmit the data. If the existing wireless communications system is Project 25 compliant, little or no change will be required to the transmit/receive equipment itself, since it already supports transmission of any type of data.Telecommunications Industry Association standard \\"TIA.102\\" (series) =Communications recording system impacts= NG9-1-1 requires that these new types of emergency communications (text, pictures, video) be recorded along with the voice communications that have traditionally been recorded. Most existing communications recorders are not capable of recording anything other than audio, and major changes may be required to bring these devices into NG9-1-1 compliance. This may require a significant investment on the part of the PSAPs if the existing equipment cannot be modified to support the new requirements. =Human resource impacts= There will also be significant operational impacts on the PSAP \\"call takers\\", dispatchers (those who dispatch emergency vehicles and personnel), and on their managers. Workloads are expected to increase, and significant new training will be required for those responsible for responding to these new communication types. Similar impacts on both public and private emergency response providers, and on Telematics and medical services providers are also anticipated.Operational Impacts and Needs Accessibility Various features of NG9-1-1, including text messaging and video messaging, provide accessible features for those who cannot use a regular telephone. It is also considered as a long term replacement for the use of TDD/TTY devices for the deaf, currently in use with 9-1-1. TDD/TTY devices are considered legacy systems, and may be replaced by other real-time text technologies that transmit text as it is being typed. In Europe, real-time text is used in Reach 112 emergency service trials. Reach 112 is a European equivalent of the accessible features of NG9-1-1.

Three incorporated villages are served by Meigs Local Schools: Pomeroy, Middleport, and Rutland. Notable unincorporated communities in the district include Darwin and Langsville. History Meigs Local School District was formed through the consolidation of three smaller school districts: Rutland-Northwestern Local, Middleport Exempted Village and Pomeroy Exempted Village school districts in 1965. In 1970, students from the three high schools that represented the former school districts (Rutland, Middleport and Pomeroy) consolidated and were enrolled at the District's new high school, which was built along Pomeroy Pike. Meigs Local then began control over the seven remaining school buildings that were governed by the three former Districts: Bradbury Elementary (built 1925), Harrisonville Elementary (built 1930), Meigs Junior High (built 1936), Middleport Elementary (built 1957), Pomeroy Elementary (built 1961), Rutland Elementary (built 1935), Salem Center Elementary (built c. 1945), and Salisbury Elementary (built c. 1952). In 1999, the Board of Education approved of a school bond measure that would allow for the construction of a new elementary school divided into two wings - a primary school and an intermediate school, a new middle school and renovations to the existing high school. In 2002, renovations to Meigs High School were complete and in 2003, Meigs Elementary and Meigs Middle School opened, which consolidated the seven preexisting elementary buildings and junior high school. After closure of the District's former schools, Bradbury, Middleport and Pomeroy elementary schools began serving the communities in other capacities. Salisbury Elementary was renovated and converted to serve as the District's administrative office building. Harrisonville Elementary and Meigs Junior High were sold.

New-to-air episodes are generally scheduled on a weekly basis, although some episodes from the fifth series were stripped daily across weeknights. Premise The show involves a man or woman guest going for dinner at three different people's houses on consecutive nights. The hosts are shown preparing a meal, usually some kind of interesting dish, and then the guest arrives. Afterward each host gives ratings of the guest, but then it is up to the guest to subsequently choose which of them they would like to go on a date to a restaurant with. The two losing contestants are given ready meals. At the end of the show, the viewers are told whether they are still dating or not. Sometimes updates of the romantic lives of the two unpicked hosts are given as well. Celebrity version A celebrity version of the show has also aired since its move to ITVBe, featuring well-known British media personalities as the date-selecting participant.

Background A descendant of the great Nearco through both her sire and her dam, Eliza was sired by multiple stakes winner, Mt. Livermore, a son of the outstanding sire, Blushing Groom. Her dam was owner Allen Paulson's Daring Bidder, a daughter of the 1966 American Co-Champion Older Male Horse, Bold Bidder. In his 2003 book, Legacies of the Turf, noted race historian Edward L. Bowen wrote that according to Paulson family banter, Madeleine Paulson traded Cigar to husband Allen for Eliza. Racing career Racing in Allen Paulson's name, Eliza was trained in 1992 by the then thirty-year-old Alex Hassinger Jr., who had just obtained his training license. At age two, the filly made five starts. She finished second in the Sorrento Stakes and won the Arlington-Washington Lassie and Alcibiades Stakes en route to the most important win of her career, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. Raced that year at Florida's Gulfstream Park, Eliza set a new stakes record time. Her 1992 performances earned her American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly honors. At age three, Eliza made four starts. She won the Grade I Santa Anita Oaks, ran second to Dispute in the Grade I Kentucky Oaks, and was third against colts in the Grade I Santa Anita Derby. She made four more starts at age four in 1994, her best result a third in the June Darling Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack. Breeding record Retired to broodmare duty, Eliza was bred to Allen Paulson's Theatrical plus important stallions such as Storm Bird, A.P. Indy and Fusaichi Pegasus. The most successful of her foals in racing was Mr. Kent who won four races in Japan and earned the equivalent of US$728,607. References * Bowen, Edward L.

History  The Dowler family was engaged in the brass founding business since the late-18th century and had been making whistles since the early 1860s at least. In 1876, the company was named after William Dowler, following protracted legal fights concerning inheritance between the brothers George and William Dowler. In 1870, a large fire that started at the vesta match-making department destroyed the factory, halting production for over half a year. The tragedy was well-covered by the newspapers at the time, as Dowler was one of only 20 Birmingham companies employing more than 500 workers. The company was located at 91 Great Charles Street and later Graham Street Works (beginning in 1897). The button factory exists to this day as W Dowler & Sons Ltd. 11-15 Brearley Street, Birmingham 19.  Whistles  Dowler was one of four large British whistle makers in the nineteenth century along with T Yates, J Dixon & sons& J Stevens & Son, later joined by J Hudson & Co.  Models and types  Dowler made several kinds of whistles, notably Beauforts & Cased Beauforts, as well as general service whistles (GSWs) and Porteous top GSWs. Dowler also made button whistles: escargot-type whistle with metal buttons or coins at the sides of the barrel. Though Dowler is mostly known such models, rare models attributed to him include the Hiat Registered Design of 1894: a combination of an escargot whistle with button sides and a beaufort with mouthpiece, sometimes referred to as Crest-top Beaufort. The company subcontracted manufacturing to A De Courcy & J Hudson & Co. from about 1904 onwards. = Body Stamps= Dowler was the largest supplier of Beaufort whistles to particular police forces during the 1870s. From 1884 onward, GSWs became the main standard with most police forces after J. Hudson & Co. won the contract for supplying the Metropolitan Police in 1883. With rare exceptions, 19th century stamps bearing a specific Police Force name were either made by Hudson or Dowler (Dowler being much more scarce). Police Forces stamps either on Beaufort or GSWs whistles made by Dowler include *Birmingham Police * Salford Police * Maidstone Police * Bradford Police * Leeds Police * Edinburgh Police * Wakefield City Police * Brighton Police * Hove Police * Leicester Police * Wallacey police * Liverpool City Police * Bristol Police * Lancashire County Constabulary * West Riding Constabulary (WRC Police) * Derby Borough Police * The Knoxcall Police Call * Manchester Police (sometimes numbered or with additional stamp \\" A Inspector\\" and number of \\"Superintendent\\"and letter) Other Stamps on GSWs: * \\"Manchester Highway Department \\" (numbered) * \\" International\\" and \\"International police whistle \\" (brand name for Dowler cheaper GSW model.)

He worked as an attorney, and served two terms in the Ohio House of Representatives, having won election in November 1928 and November 1930 as a Republican candidate representing Hamilton County. In December 1966, Nippert bought into the Cincinnati Reds as part of the ownership group led by Francis L. Dale. He bought majority control of the franchise in January 1973. Nippert was at the helm for the Reds' most successful era, in which they won the World Series of 1975 and 1976.

Founded in 1984 by Yoram Hazony, the magazine has played a role in various controversies, including a national debate about white privilege. Notable alumni include United States Senator Ted Cruz and Wendy Kopp, the founder of Teach for America. Four editors have gone on to be Rhodes scholars. History=Founding= In the early 1980s, there were several failed efforts to create a magazine with a conservative viewpoint at Princeton University, including the Madison Report, which folded due to financial difficulties. In October 1984, a group of students including Yoram Hazony of the Princeton class of 1986, as well as Dan Polisar, Julia Fulton (later Hazony), Evelyn Gordon, Amy Bix, Peter Heineke, Ziv Hellman, Ya'akov Menken, Mark Vargo, and Alan Deutschman, began publishing the Princeton Tory, planning for six issues in the initial year. They felt there was a need for a \\"thinking journal\\" to provide a forum for moderate and conservative viewpoints on a campus that was in their view dominated by left-wing politics. Hazony attributed the failure of the previous attempts at conservative publications to their tendency for sensationalism and mud-slinging. In contrast, the Tory was founded to highlight cogent argumentation with early issues addressing topics such as religion in politics, the composition of the Supreme Court, and the university's endorsement of a nuclear freeze. =\\"Pen over the sledgehammer\\"= In 1986, the Tory found itself in disagreement with future noted conservative Dinesh D'Souza. At Dartmouth College, student staff members of the conservative Dartmouth Review had taken sledgehammers to a shanty town set up by protesters calling for divestment from South Africa over its Apartheid policies. D'Souza, a Dartmouth alumnus, in arguing that Princeton would not see similar political violence, was quoted in the Daily Princetonian as saying, \\"At Dartmouth there is a healthy activism on both the left and the right. At Princeton, politics masquerades as fashion. There are more conservatives who are more confident in their actions at Dartmouth. At Princeton, you only have the Tory, which is too cerebral to be considered.\\" This critique promoted a response from Tory publisher Dan Polisar: \\"D'Souza criticized the Tory for being 'too cerebral.' If that means that we do not favor using sledgehammers as a tool for political debate, then we do not object. We would rather demonstrate that the problems symbolized by shanties are exacerbated by divestment, as we did in our October issue, than to stage an attack on the symbols themselves... Campus conservatives are proud of this restraint, and should receive credit, not blame, for choosing the pen over the sledgehammer.\\" Controversies=Tal Fortgang and \\"White Privilege\\"= In April 2014, Princeton freshman Tal Fortgang penned an essay in the Tory entitled, \\"Checking My Privilege: Character as the Basis of Privilege.\\" Fortgang wrote the essay in response to being told by a classmate, after expressing his views on welfare and the national debt, to \\"check his privilege.\\" He stated, \\"The phrase, handed down by my moral superiors, descends recklessly, like an Obama-sanctioned drone, and aims laserlike at my pinkish-peach complexion, my maleness, and the nerve I displayed in offering an opinion rooted in a personal Weltanschauung.\\" The essay was picked up by Time magazine, led to an appearance on Fox News and caused a firestorm of criticism from the left and support from the right. Fortgang made use of his own family's history, with a grandfather exiled to Siberia, a grandmother sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, and a great-grandmother and five great-aunts and uncles who were shot in an open grave outside their hometown. His grandfather and father built a wicker basket business and emphasized education. Fortgang wrote, \\"While I haven't done everything for myself up to this point in my life, someone has sacrificed themselves so that I can lead a better life, but that is a legacy I am proud of.

Its last assignment was with the 3rd Air Commando Group, based at Chitose, Japan. It was disbanded on 8 October 1948. The squadron was a World War II Air Commando unit, primarily seeing combat during the Philippines Campaign (1944‚Äì45) with the 3rd Air Commando Group. There is no lineage between this unit and the 3rd Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor) which saw combat in the 1941-1942 Battle of the Philippines. History=Origins= The squadron was initially organized as the 3rd Fighter-Reconnaissance Squadron at Lakeland Army Airfield, Florida in May 1944. Many of the squadron's pilots came from the 2d Air Commando Group's 1st Fighter Squadron (Commando), which had been disbanded previously. It took several weeks, however, for the squadron to receive any aircraft, and when it did, it was a mixture of used Curtiss P-40C Warhawks and North American P-51B Mustangs which had been transferred to Lakeland from other training bases who had been re-equipped with newer aircraft. However, aircraft were aircraft and the pilots were happy to get them to fly and gain proficiency.AFHRA Document 00095466 3rd Air Commando Group History, call GP-A-CMDO-3-HI In early August the squadron moved to Alachua Army Airfield near Gainesville to begin training with units of the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT), a part of Air University which specialized in the development of new combat tactics. AAFSAT developed training maneuvers with the 318th Troop Carrier Squadron Douglas C-47 Skytrains, and Stinson L-5 Sentinels of the liaison squadrons of the group. The 3rd ACS liaison aircraft flew reconnaissance over an \\"enemy\\" airfield, and the fighter squadrons conducted simulated bombing and strafing attacks, while the Troop Carrier Squadron carried out a night glider assault. Then the assault troops had to hold out for a few days against \\"enemy\\" forces before being pulled out. With the successful completion of the exercise, the group was judged ready for deployment into combat.AFHRA Document 00095471 3rd Air Commando Group History, call GP-A-CMDO-3-HIY'Blood, William T. (2008): Air Commandos Against Japan: Allied Special Operations in World War II Burma, Naval Institute Press, Excerpted from WWII Air Commandos, Volume II (1994) and from Official History of the 159th Liaison Squadron Commando In October the men of the squadron transferred to Drew Field, Tampa Florida for final preparations. After several weeks, the squadrons began leaving by train on 24 October, heading for Camp Stoneman, Oakland California where the men were issued tropical uniforms, attending more classes and lectures, getting shots and filling out an endless number of forms. On 6 November, the men boarded ferries to board the USS General M. L. Hersey, their transport to the war zone in the Southwest Pacific. A brief stop was made at Guadacanal, which had become a major logistics base, then they proceeded to Finschafen and Hollandia on New Guinea.AFHRA Document 00061652, 3rd Fighter Squadron (Commando) history 05-01-1944-08-31-1945, call SQ-FI-CMDO-3-HI At Hollandia, the pilots were flown by transports to Nadzab Airfield, New Guinea, where they were assigned new P-51D Mustangs, as well as some additional pilots. Many of these replacements had been in the Southwest Pacific for several months and been ferrying P-40s between bases. Although none had any P-51 Mustang experience, they flew checkout flights and were informed they were to fly it. From Nadzab, sixteen Mustangs were flown to a new airfield via Biak on 7 January 1945 in the vicinity of Tanauan on Leyte. The pilots of the squadron broke into flights of four and buzzed the airstrip before turning into their landing pattern, landing two at a time, one on each side of the runway. By landing in pairs, all sixteen fighters were on the ground in less than three minutes. Also, by taking off in pairs, it shortened the time needed to form up in a group and added time over the target.AFHRA Document 00061662, 3rd Fighter Squadron (Commando) history 01-01-1945-09-30-1945, call SQ-FI-CMDO-3-SU =Philippines Campaign= The squadron was immediately tasked with orders for the following day; to bomb and strafe enemy-held airfields on Mindanao, one of them being the former Del Monte Field which was used to evacuate General MacArthur to Australia in 1942. The mission was largely uneventful, with the airfields being put temporarily out of action and two enemy planes destroyed on the ground. For the next several weeks, the squadron flew missions throughout the Philippines.

New Imprint by the Office of Air Force History Washington, D.C., 1983Chapter 15, The Zebras Are Loose, Y'Blood. Air Commandos Against Japan On 9 January 1945, two Corps of the Sixth United States Army landed on the shores of Lingayen Gulf on Luzon, just a few miles south of where the Japanese had invaded the island on 22 December 1941. From the landing beaches, the Corps drove south to the Manila area while maintaining a strong defensive line to the North. In this liberated beachhead, two major airfields plus smaller liaison landing strips were hastily constructed. On 13 January the 3rd flew a reconnaissance mission of southeast Luzon and discovered a concentration of enemy troops and equipment attempting to cross a river using a ferry. The pilots began strafing runs which destroyed the ferry and also leveled a village at the site. The Mustangs then attacked enemy vehicles up and down the road, destroying an estimated twelve to fifteen and damaging an undetermined number of vehicles. Also a sweep over the enemy- held airfield at Bulan destroyed a Mitsubishi A6M Zero in a revetment. The next day, ten squadron aircraft escorted some North American B-25 Mitchells in a strike on some enemy positions in the town of Aparri. After destroying the target, a neighboring airfield was strafed, destroying several enemy aircraft on the ground. On the way back over the Cagayan valley, several two-engine Japanese aircraft were seen heading north. Both enemy aircraft were shot down without loss. On 16 January, the Japanese-held Clark Field was attacked by the squadron. After being captured in 1942, Clark Field became the main Japanese air base in the Philippines. That day, four Air Commando P-51D Mustangs caught a group of enemy aircraft on the parking ramp, with their propellers turning over slowly. Four Nakajima Ki-44s were struck by a 500-pound bomb and were destroyed. Five more enemy fighters were destroyed in strafing runs, and no squadron aircraft were damaged. The same day on Negros Island, other 3rd Fighter Squadron Mustangs discovered some camouflaged enemy aircraft on a landing strip. They were also obliterated by strafing fire, but one Mustang was hit by 20-mm antiaircraft fire and was forced to bail out over the sea. The pilot, Capt. Charles B. Adams, was picked up safely by a Consolidated PBY Catalina the next day and he was returned to the squadron. Shortly afterwards, the squadron moved up from Leyte to Lingayen Airfield on Luzon. The squadron's last mission from Tanaunan hit Baguio, the prewar summer capital of the Philippine Government. It had become the Japanese Commander in the Philippines, General Yamashita's headquarters. Sixteen Mustangs, along with Consolidated B-24 Liberators from the 22d Bombardment Group attacked the Headquarters. The target was obliterated with direct hits on administration buildings, the message center, warehouses, barracks and officer's quarters. Unable to be re-equipped, the Japanese resorted to hiding their remaining aircraft, and few enemy aircraft were being caught in the open. Throughout the remainder of January enemy air activity in the Philippines was minimal, as the Mustangs outclassed the Japanese aircraft thoroughly. The move to Mangaldan Airfield on Luzon meant that much of the time, the Mustangs were used flying close support missions for the infantry. The drive on Manila by the Sixth Army was on a narrow front from the Lyngayen beaches, and the squadron was needed to protect the division's open flanks. The month of February saw the squadron attack a pair of Japanese ships, identified at an Akizuki-class destroyer and destroyer escort being sighted heading south in the Luzon Strait between Formosa and Luzon. Twenty-two Mustangs were assembled from both the 3rd and 4th Fighter Squadrons and loaded with 500-pound bombs. Fighters scored two direct hits on the larger vessel and two on the smaller one. The Japanese defensive gunners were accurate and several P-51s were damaged, with two going down, but both pilots were recovered. =Formosa= Although combat continued on Luzon, the main focus of the squadron was changed to the Chinese island of Formosa, about 230 miles north of Luzon. Formosa was dotted with Japanese airfields and had been the springboard for the Japanese Invasion of the Philippines on 8 December 1941, when Fifth Air Force was largely destroyed on the ground. There would be no close air support missions over Formosa, instead the Mustangs of both the 3rd and 4th Fighter Squadrons flew combat sweeps and anti-shipping strikes, escorting B-24 and B-25 bombing missions over the island. However, Formosa was also well-defended, with attacking American aircraft being lost to flack. On 7 February, the Taakao Airfield was visited by the squadron, with no less than fifteen Japanese fighters being attacked on the ground, along with a number of vehicles. One Mustang was shot down, its pilot recovered by Air-Sea rescue. On another mission, the Mustangs intercepted a Japanese Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" bomber heading for Luzon. Dropping their wing tanks, two squadron aircraft attacked the bomber, one on each side. Their shells went completely through the bomber, shattering its cockpit. The bomber burst into flames and fell into the ocean. =Victory on Luzon= While Formosa continued to be attacked, air support for Sixth Army on Luzon was flown as well. The infantry gave both the 3rd and 4th squadrons high praise for attacking and largely destroying Japanese resistance in places such as Baguio, Antipolo, Balete Pass, and the Villa Verde Trail. The double duty of attacks on Japanese infantry and on Formosa kept the squadron busy. In March, the squadron also began attacks on the East Coast of China against enemy supply dumps, locomotives and other targets of opportunity the long- range Mustangs could find. During early April Fifth Air Force B-24 Liberators began attacking Japanese shipping in Hong Kong harbor. After rendezvousing with the bombers, fighters of the 3rd spotted two Japanese interceptors coming up from an airfield. The P-51s traded shots with the enemy before the Zeros broke off their attack.Chapter 16, Behind Enemy Lines, Y'Blood. Air Commandos Against Japan During April, with the exception of the attack on Hong Kong and some uneventful fighter sweeps over Formosa, the 3rd and 4th Fighter Squadrons flew close support missions for the Army 32d Infantry Division which was working its way to the east and south along the Villa Verde Trail in northern Luzon. However, many times the infantrymen were just yards from enemy positions, and were too close to be supported according to conventional wisdom for air attacks. After sending some squadron members to the front lines to work with the ground commanders of the 32d, the pilots convinced the soldiers that the Air Commandos could do the job. The pilots then returned to the airfield, carefully briefed the other pilots and then proceeded to fly successful close air support missions. In May and during June, with the Japanese retreating and being unable to be reinforced, targets for the Air Commandos became more and more scarce and planes often returned to base with their bombs. When they did find targets, their bombs were usually dropped accurately and the G.I.s then moved in to mop up. Missions to Formosa were flown regularly, although many were flown to cover rescue submarines and PBY Catalinas or to escort B-24 Liberators bombing the island. Nevertheless, P-51 sweeps over Luzon continued to have a devastating effect on the enemy, destroying numerous trucks, bridges and numerous enemy-held buildings and other structures. By the end of June, General MacArthur declared the Luzon Campaign over, however, the Japanese remained active in the Cagayan Valley where their last forces were gathered to make their stand. During July, the fighter squadrons flew numerous missions while the infantry was closing in on enemy units. =Okinawa and postwar activities= By Mid-July 1945, orders were received to begin moving the 3rd Air Commando Group from Luzon to Ie Shima, a small island on the northeast of Okinawa. There the group would prepare for the final assault on Japan. The 3rd and 4th Fighter Squadrons remained on Luzon for the time being flying little. The final fighter sweeps against Japanese forces on Luzon was flown on 25 July, nearly a month after the declared end of the campaign. Then on 6 August news of the Atomic Bomb attack on Japan was received. A second Atomic Bomb attack on the 9th led to the end of the war when on 15 July the Japanese announced they were ready to surrender. When the cease-fire was announced, the fighter squadrons did not move to Ie Shima until 28 August. From the base there they did get a few very long-range missions over Japan before V-J Day, flying some fighter sweeps over Kyushu, but not firing a shot. On 20 September the squadron and a few ground personnel flew to Atsugi Airfield on Honshu, refueled and then flew north to Chitose Airfield on the northern Japanese Island of Hokkaido. There the squadron was assigned an air defense mission against any rouge Soviet fighters that may find their way south. For six months, the squadron performed occupation duty and on 25 March 1946, the squadron received orders to demobilize, its members receiving transportation orders to return to the United States.Epilouge, Y'Blood.

Emergo is an abstract strategy game critically acclaimed for the depth of its strategy and tactics. It was created by Christian Freeling and Ed van Zon in 1986 and belongs to the \\"stacking\\" category of games, or column checkers, along with Bashni and Lasca. The name comes from the motto of the Dutch province of Zeeland: Luctor et emergo meaning: \\"I wrestle and emerge\\". The goal of the game is to capture all of the opponents pieces similar to Checkers/Draughts. Emergo, and all column checkers, differ from most draughts variants because of their unique method of capture. A opponent's piece is added to the capturing player's column rather than being removed. Men can be recaptured from an opponent later on in the game. Christian Freeling considers Emergo one of his six most important games, along with Dameo, Grand Chess, Storisende, Sygo, and Symple.  History  Emergo had its origins in a conversation between Ed van Zon and Christian Freeling when van Zon introduced him to a game called Stapeldammen, which he asserted had \\"very beautiful things\\" happening in it. Freeling had been vaguely familiar with Stapeldammen, although he knew it by the name of \\"Indian draughts,\\" but had never been particularly interested in the concept. Stapeldammen is a column checkers game, alongside Bashni and Lasca, adapted to a 10x10 board and utilizes many familiar concepts from International draughts. It lacks only International draughts‚Äô rules regarding promotion and the prohibition on jumping over the same piece twice. When a man reaches the other side of the board, because pieces are not promoted, it is forced to stay there unless it has a backwards capture available to it. Freeling says that \\"Ed saw what I had failed to see: there was beauty flickering through the chaotic proceedings in the game. Using thin backgammon men he had me convinced in minutes.\\" Freeling, however, was not so convinced that Stapeldammen's lack of promotion served the game well, and had similar reservations about using international draught's promotion rules. He eventually decided that the problem was not the lack of promotion, but the concept of an initial position and forward direction. He says, \\"In checkers terms, all men should be Kings to begin with.\\" This abandonment of forward direction and an initial position was the beginning of Emergo as a concept. Freeling suggested an \\"entering phase\\" to van Zon and they played around with concept creating what they would later call an \\"all kings lasca.\\" In this early rendition of Emergo there were no rules regarding entering a piece other than that capture, if possible, took precedence over entering a man. They began playing this way and immendiately ran into an issue. > \\"So we started putting men on the board in our first game, using no other > rules than entering a man if not obliged to capture, and capturing in all > directions. The movement stage would thus turn into an 'all kings Lasca'. > Soon Ed had sneakily managed an anchorman waiting to capture a particular > piece that he started feeding around the board. It followed his lead > compulsory, like a dog. He eventually liberated a column of ten or > thereabouts, and I was still stuck with a similar pile of men in hand - what > later would be coined the 'shadowpiece'.\\" They decided that a phase where one player had all of their men on the board while the other player still had most of their pieces in hand was \\"unsatisfactory.\\" They decided that if a player had placed all of their pieces on the board, then the other player could enter all the pieces remaining in their hand at once. They played using this entering rule for roughly an hour, but felt that the entering phase still lacked a \\"solidity\\" and was too dominated by tactical considerations rather than long term strategic ones. They decided that the problem was ultimately in the feeding tactics, which prevented strong positions from arising for either side as a result of the entering tactics by the other player. They decided to restrict the freedom of the other player to force feeding and instead let it be the result of the entering decision of the other player. This gave the entering phase the current restrictions on placements that force a player to capture a man, and gave it the strategic solidity they were looking for. The last pieces of the puzzle were the realization that the two players, Black and White had slightly different goals and priorities during the entering phase, resulting in the rule restricting white's first placement, and the board size. They settled on a 9x9 board because of its odd number of squares and elimination of tric-trac corners.  Rules  Emergo has two Players, Black and White. A 'piece' is defined as a column of one or more men. Columns may consist of all white pieces, all black pieces, white with black prisoners, or black with white prisoners. The top man is called the cap, with all the pieces underneath as prisoners. The color of the cap determines the piece's owner. Capture occurs by jumping an opponent's piece and landing on the square beyond, which must be vacant for the capture to take place. When a piece is captured, rather than being removed from the game, it is placed beneath the capturing piece as a prisoner. Over the course of the game this results in a decrease in the total number of pieces in play, while the remaining pieces \\"climb upwards\\" as they grow taller. If an opponent's cap is captured, revealing the prisoner underneath, the prisoner becomes the new cap and the color signifies the owner. Capture may occur in any direction except by making a 180¬∞ turn. Emergo has two phases to the game. The first is the entering phase and the second is the movement phase. = Entering Phase: = The game begins with each player holding their twelve men in hand. White moves first and enters a man on any vacant dark square on the checker board, then turns alternate until all the pieces have been placed on the board. If a capture is possible a player must make a capturing move that captures the largest number of pieces possible instead of entering a man. A player may not enter more than one piece per turn unless their opponent already has all their pieces on the board, then they may enter all of their remaining pieces. This occurs only as a result of obligatory capture. There are only two restrictions during the entering phase. White may not enter a piece in the center square on his first turn, and no player may enter a piece that forces their opponent to then capture it unless that player is already forced to make any capture during their turn. Playing a piece to capture an opponent's piece with your own is legal. = Movement Phase: = Once all pieces are on the field a player may move one of their men diagonally one space in any direction. During the movement phase, as in the entering phase, majority capture is obligatory. This means if a capture is possible the player must make the capture that results in the largest number of pieces being added to the column. Once a player makes a capture their turn ends and they may not move a piece until their next turn. The game ends when a player cannot make a legal move or their pieces have all been captured. Trivia * Emergo initially had two versions, the standard game played on a 9√ó9 square board and a hexagonal variant consisting of 37 hex cells. The latter, known as Hexemergo, was abandoned after play testing because of a winning strategy that was found in correspondence play. The square version does not suffer from a similar problem. * Of all the games he has created, Emergo is Christian Freeling's personal favourite.Freeling, Christian. \\"Geek of the Week #655 Christian Freeling - christianF.\\" BoardGameGeek, edited by W E.

It was once thought that this species occurred in North America as well, but comparative genomic studies indicate the Afro- Eurasian and American populations are discrete and not closely related enough to represent a single species. The North American populations are now treated as a different species, Lasius aphidicola. The queens of this species seek out a Lasius niger worker ant, to first kill in order to gain the worker ant's scent and then to discreetly sneak inside a Lasius niger nest. Once inside the Lasius umbratus queen finds the Lasius niger queen, and kills her. The worker ants will care for the new queen's larvae and slowly the colony will be made up of only Lasius umbratus individuals.

Many altar crosses and religious statuary are traditionally veiled during this period in the Christian year. Lent (Latin: Quadragesima, 'Fortieth') is a solemn religious observance in the Christian liturgical calendar that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends approximately six weeks later, before Easter Sunday. The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer for Easter through prayer, doing penance, mortifying the flesh, repentance of sins, almsgiving, and self- denial. This event is observed in the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, Moravian, Presbyterian, Oriental Orthodox, Reformed, and Roman Catholic Churches. Some Anabaptist and evangelical churches also observe the Lenten season. The last week of Lent is Holy Week, starting with Palm Sunday. Following the New Testament story, Jesus' crucifixion is commemorated on Good Friday, and at the beginning of the next week the joyful celebration of Easter Sunday recalls the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. In Lent, many Christians commit to fasting, as well as giving up certain luxuries in order to replicate the account of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ's journey into the desert for 40 days; this is known as one's Lenten sacrifice. Many Christians also add a Lenten spiritual discipline, such as reading a daily devotional or praying through a Lenten calendar, to draw themselves near to God. The Stations of the Cross, a devotional commemoration of Christ's carrying the Cross and of his execution, are often observed. Many Roman Catholic and some Protestant churches remove flowers from their altars, while crucifixes, religious statues, and other elaborate religious symbols are often veiled in violet fabrics in solemn observance of the event. Throughout Christendom, some adherents mark the season with the traditional abstention from the consumption of meat, most notably among Lutherans, Roman Catholics and Anglicans.This practice is observed in numerous pious Christian countries, although the form of abstention may vary depending on what is customary. Some abstain from meat for 40 days, some do so only on Fridays, or some only on Good Friday itself. By pontifical decree under Pope Alexander VI, eggs and dairy products may be consumed by penitents in Spain and its colonized territories. Lent is traditionally described as lasting for 40 days, in commemoration of the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert, according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, before beginning his public ministry, during which he endured temptation by Satan. Depending on the Christian denomination and local custom, Lent ends either on the evening of Maundy Thursday, or at sundown on Holy Saturday, when the Easter Vigil is celebrated. Regardless, Lenten practices are properly maintained until the evening of Holy Saturday. Etymology Lent celebrants carrying out a street procession during Holy Week, in Granada, Nicaragua. The violet color is often associated with penance and detachment. Similar Christian penitential practice is seen in other Christian countries, sometimes associated with fasting. The English word Lent is a shortened form of the Old English word , meaning \\"spring season\\", as its Dutch language cognate (Old Dutch ) still does today. A dated term in German, (Old High German ), is also related. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, 'the shorter form (? Old Germanic type *la≈ãgito- , *la≈ãgiton-) seems to be a derivative of *la≈ãgo- long ... and may possibly have reference to the lengthening of the days as characterizing the season of spring'. The origin of the -en element is less clear: it may simply be a suffix, or lencten may originally have been a compound of *la≈ãgo- 'long' and an otherwise little- attested word *-tino, meaning 'day'. In languages spoken where Christianity was earlier established, such as Greek and Latin, the term signifies the period dating from the 40th day before Easter. In modern Greek the term is (Sarakost√≠), derived from the earlier (Tessarakost√≠), meaning \\"fortieth\\". The corresponding word in Latin, (\\"fortieth\\"), is the origin of the terms used in Latin-derived languages and in some others. Examples in the Romance language group are: Catalan , French , Galician , Italian , Occitan , Portuguese , Romanian , Sardinian , Spanish , and Walloon . Examples in non-Latin-based languages are: Albanian , Basque , Croatian , Irish , Swahili , Tagalog , and Welsh . In other languages, the name used refers to the activity associated with the season. Thus it is called \\"fasting period\\" in Czech (), German (), and Norwegian (/), and it is called \\"great fast\\" in Arabic (ÿßŸÑÿµŸàŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ®Ÿäÿ± ‚Äì al- ·π£awm al-kabƒ´r, literally, \\"the Great Fast\\"), Polish (), Russian ( ‚Äì vieliki post), and Ukrainian ( ‚Äì velyky pist). Romanian, apart from a version based on the Latin term referring to the 40 days (see above), also has a \\"great fast\\" version: . Dutch has three options, one of which means fasting period, and the other two referring to the 40-day period indicated in the Latin term: , and , respectively. Origin Despite the existence of many fasting traditions before spring festivals, such as Easter, the origin of Lent is not certain. There are three prevailing theories: One, that it was created at the Council of Nicea in 325 and there is no earlier incarnation. Two, that it is based on an Egyptian post-theophany fast. Three, a combination of origins syncretized around the Council of Nicea.https://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/193181.pdf Duration and traditions Various Christian denominations calculate the 40 days of Lent differently. The way they observe Lent also differs. =Roman Catholicism= In the Roman Rite since 1970, Lent starts on Ash Wednesday and ends on Holy Thursday Evening (before the Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper). This comprises a period of 44 days. The Lenten fast excludes Sundays and continues through Good Friday and Holy Saturday, totalling 40 days. In the Ambrosian Rite, Lent begins on the Sunday that follows what is celebrated as Ash Wednesday in the rest of the Latin Catholic Church, and ends as in the Roman Rite, thus being of 40 days, counting the Sundays but not Holy Thursday. The day for beginning the Lenten fast is the following Monday, the first weekday in Lent. The special Ash Wednesday fast is transferred to the first Friday of the Ambrosian Lent. Until this rite was revised by Saint Charles Borromeo the liturgy of the First Sunday of Lent was festive, celebrated in white vestments with chanting of the Gloria in Excelsis and Alleluia, in line with the recommendation in , \\"When you fast, do not look gloomy\\". See paragraph: Duration of the FastThe \\"Secret of the Mass\\" in the First Sunday of Lent ‚Äì \\"Sacrificium Quadragesimalis Initii\\", Missale Romanum Ambrosianus During Lent, the Church discourages marriages, but couples may do so if they forgo the special blessings of the Nuptial Mass and reduced social celebrations.Stuber, Stanley I. (1960). New Revised edition. Primer on Roman Catholicism for Protestants: an Appraisal of the Basic Differences between the Roman Catholic Church and Protestantism. New York: Association Press. p. 57. The period of Lent observed in the Eastern Catholic Churches corresponds to that in other churches of Eastern Christianity that have similar traditions. =Protestantism and Western Orthodoxy= In Protestant and Western Orthodox Churches, the season of Lent lasts from Ash Wednesday to the evening of Holy Saturday. This calculation makes Lent last 46 days if the 6 Sundays are included, but only 40 days if they are excluded. This definition is still that of the Anglican Church, Lutheran Church, Methodist Church, and Western Rite Orthodox Church. =Eastern Orthodoxy and Byzantine Rite= In the Byzantine Rite, i.e., the Eastern Orthodox Great Lent (Greek: ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑ Œ§ŒµœÉœÉŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒøœÉœÑŒÆ or ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑ ŒùŒ∑œÉœÑŒµŒØŒ±, meaning \\"Great 40 Days\\" and \\"Great Fast\\" respectively) is the most important fasting season in the church year. The 40 days of Great Lent includes Sundays, and begins on Clean Monday and are immediately followed by what are considered distinct periods of fasting, Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday, which in turn are followed straightway by Holy Week. Great Lent is broken only after the Paschal (Easter) Divine Liturgy. The Eastern Orthodox Church maintains the traditional Church's teaching on fasting. The rules for lenten fasting are the monastic rules. Fasting in the Orthodox Church is more than simply abstaining from certain foods. During the Great Lent Orthodox Faithful intensify their prayers and spiritual exercises, go to church services more often, study the Scriptures and the works of the Church Fathers in depth, limit their entertainment and spendings and focus on charity and good works. =Oriental Orthodoxy= Among the Oriental Orthodox, there are various local traditions regarding Lent. Those using the Alexandrian Rite, i.e., the Coptic Orthodox, Coptic Catholic, Ethiopian Orthodox, Ethiopian Catholic, Eritrean Orthodox, and Eritrean Catholic Churches, observe eight weeks of Lent. In Ethiopian Orthodoxy, fasting (tsome) lasts for 55 continuous days before Easter (Fasika), although the fast is divided into three separate periods: Tsome Hirkal, eight days commemorating an early Christian figure; Tsome Arba, 40 days of Lent; and Tsome Himamat, seven days commemorating Holy Week. Fasting involves abstention from animal products (meat, dairy, and eggs), and refraining from eating or drinking before 3:00 pm. Ethiopian devotees may also abstain from sexual activity and the consumption of alcohol. As in the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the date of Easter is reckoned according to the Julian Calendar, and usually occurs later than Easter according to Gregorian Calendar used by Catholic and Protestant Churches. Other related fasting periods The season of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday, most notably by the public imposition of ashes. In this photograph, a woman receives a cross of ashes on Ash Wednesday outside an Anglican church. Divine Service on Ash Wednesday. The number 40 has many Biblical references: *Moses spent 40 days on Mount Sinai with God () *Elijah spent 40 days and nights walking to Mount Horeb () * God sent 40 days and nights of rain in the great flood of Noah () * The Hebrew people wandered 40 years in the desert while traveling to the Promised Land () *Jonah's prophecy of judgment gave 40 days to the city of Nineveh in which to repent or be destroyed (). * Jesus retreated into the wilderness, where He fasted for 40 days, and was tempted by the devil (, , ). He overcame all three of Satan's temptations by citing scripture to the devil, at which point the devil left him, angels ministered to Jesus, and He began His ministry. Jesus further said that His disciples should fast \\"when the bridegroom shall be taken from them\\" (), a reference to his Passion. * Since, presumably, the Apostles fasted as they mourned the death of Jesus, Christians have traditionally fasted during the annual commemoration of his burial. * It is the traditional belief that Jesus lay for 40 hours in the tomb, which led to the 40 hours of total fasting that preceded the Easter celebration in the early ChurchLent & Beyond: Dr. Peter Toon ‚Äì From Septuagesima to Quadragesima (web site gone, no alternate source found, originally cited 27 August 2010) (the biblical reference to 'three days in the tomb' is understood by them as spanning three days, from Friday afternoon to early Sunday morning, rather than three 24-hour periods of time). Some Christian denominations, such as The Way International and Logos Apostolic Church of God, as well as Anglican scholar E. W. Bullinger in The Companion Bible, believe Christ was in the grave for a total of 72 hours, reflecting the type of Jonah in the belly of the whale. One of the most important ceremonies at Easter is the baptism of the initiates on Easter Eve. The fast was initially undertaken by the catechumens to prepare them for the reception of this sacrament. Later, the period of fasting from Good Friday until Easter Day was extended to six days, to correspond with the six weeks of training necessary to give the final instruction to those converts who were to be baptized. Converts to Christianity followed a strict catechumenate or period of instruction and discipline prior to receiving the sacrament of baptism, sometimes lasting up to three years. In Jerusalem near the close of the fourth century, classes were held throughout Lent for three hours each day. With the legalization of Christianity (by the Edict of Milan) and its later imposition as the state religion of the Roman Empire, its character was endangered by the great influx of new members. In response, the Lenten fast and practices of self- renunciation were required annually of all Christians, both to show solidarity with the catechumens, and for their own spiritual benefit. Associated customs Statues and icons veiled in violet shrouds for Passiontide in St Pancras Church, Ipswich, England There are traditionally 40 days in Lent; these are marked by fasting, both from foods and festivities, and by other acts of penance. The three traditional practices to be taken up with renewed vigour during Lent are prayer (justice towards God), fasting (justice towards self), and almsgiving (justice towards neighbours). However, in modern times, observers give up partaking in vices and often invest the time or money saved in charitable purposes or organizations. In addition, some believers add a regular spiritual discipline, to bring them closer to God, such as reading a Lenten daily devotional. Another practice commonly added is the singing of the Stabat Mater hymn in designated groups. Among Filipino Catholics, the recitation of the epic of Christ' passion, called Pasiong Mahal, is also observed. In some Christian countries, grand religious processions and cultural customs are observed, and the faithful attempt to visit seven churches during Holy Week to pray the Stations of the Cross and pray at each church's Altar of Repose. In many liturgical Christian denominations, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday form the Easter Triduum. Lent is a season of grief that necessarily ends with a great celebration of Easter. Thus, it is known in Eastern Orthodox circles as the season of \\"Bright Sadness\\". It is a season of sorrowful reflection which is punctuated by breaks in the fast on Sundays. In cultivation of vegetables in a temperate oceanic climate in the northern hemisphere, Lent corresponds partly with the hungry gap. Omission of Gloria and Alleluia The Gloria in excelsis Deo, which is usually said or sung on Sundays at Mass (or Communion) of the Roman and Anglican rites, is omitted on the Sundays of Lent, but continues in use on solemnities and feasts and on special celebrations of a more solemn kind.General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 53 Some mass compositions were written especially for Lent, such as Michael Haydn's Missa tempore Quadragesimae, without Gloria, in D minor, and for modest forces, only choir and organ. The Gloria is used on Maundy Thursday, to the accompaniment of bells, which then fall silent until the Gloria in excelsis of the Easter Vigil.Roman Missal, Thursday of the Lord's Supper, 7 The Lutheran Divine Service, the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, the Anglican Churches, and the Presbyterian service of worship associate the Alleluia with joy and omit it entirely throughout Lent, not only at Mass but also in the canonical hours and outside the liturgy. The word \\"Alleluia\\" at the beginning and end of the Acclamation Before the Gospel at Mass is replaced by another phrase. Before 1970, the omission began with Septuagesima, and the whole Acclamation was omitted and was replaced by a Tract; and in the Liturgy of the Hours the word \\"Alleluia\\", normally added to the Gloria Patri at the beginning of each Hour ‚Äì now simply omitted during Lent ‚Äì was replaced by the phrase Laus tibi, Domine, rex aeternae gloriae (Praise to you, O Lord, king of eternal glory). Until the Ambrosian Rite was revised by Saint Charles Borromeo the liturgy of the First Sunday of Lent was festive, celebrated with chanting of the Gloria and Alleluia, in line with the recommendation in , \\"When you fast, do not look gloomy\\". In the Byzantine Rite, the Gloria (Great Doxology) continues to be used in its normal place in the Matins service, and the Alleluia appears all the more frequently, replacing \\"God is the Lord\\" at Matins. Veiling of religious images prostrates at the start of the Good Friday liturgy at Holy Family Church, in accordance with the rubrics in the Book of Worship. The processional cross is veiled in black, the liturgical colour associated with Good Friday in Methodist Churches. A crucifix on the high altar is veiled for Lent. Saint Martin's parish, W√ºrttemberg, Germany In certain pious Christian states, in which liturgical forms of Christianity predominate, religious objects were traditionally veiled for the entire 40 days of Lent. Though perhaps uncommon in the United States of America, this pious practice is consistently observed in Goa, Malta, Peru, the Philippines (the latter only for the entire duration of Holy Week, with the exception of processional images), and in the Spanish cities: Barcelona, M√°laga, and Seville. In Ireland, before Vatican II, when impoverished rural Catholic convents and parishes could not afford purple fabrics, they resorted to either removing the statues altogether or, if too heavy or bothersome, turned the statues to face the wall. As is popular custom, the 14 Stations of the Cross plaques on the walls are not veiled. Crosses were often adorned with jewels and gemstones, the form referred to as Crux Gemmata. To keep the faithful from adoring the crucifixes elaborated with ornamentation, veiling it in royal purple fabrics came into place. The violet colour later evolved as a color of penance and mourning. Further liturgical changes in modernity reduced such observances to the last week of Passiontide. In parishes that could afford only small quantities of violet fabrics, only the heads of the statues were veiled. If no violet fabrics could be afforded at all, then the religious statues and images were turned around facing the wall. Flowers were always removed as a sign of solemn mourning. In the pre-1992 Methodist liturgy and pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, the last two weeks of Lent are known as Passiontide, a period beginning on the Fifth Sunday in Lent, which in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal is called the First Sunday in Passiontide and in earlier editions Passion Sunday. All statues (and in England paintings as well) in the church were traditionally veiled in violet. This was seen as in keeping with the Gospel of that Sunday (), in which Jesus \\"hid himself\\" from the people. Within many churches in the United States of America, after the Second Vatican Council, the need to veil statues or crosses became increasingly irrelevant and was deemed unnecessary by some diocesan bishops. As a result, the veils were removed at the singing of the Gloria in Excelsis Deo during the Easter Vigil. In 1970, the name \\"Passiontide\\" was dropped, although the last two weeks are markedly different from the rest of the season, and continuance of the tradition of veiling images is left to the discretion of a country's conference of bishops or even to individual parishes as pastors may wish. On Good Friday, the Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches traditionally veiled \\"all pictures, statutes, and the cross are covered in mourning black\\", while \\"the chancel and altar coverings are replaced with black, and altar candles are extinguished\\". The fabrics are then \\"replaced with white on sunrise on Easter Sunday\\". Pre-Lenten festivals The carnival celebrations which in many cultures traditionally precede Lent are seen as a last opportunity for excess before Lent begins. Some of the most famous are the Carnival of Barranquilla, the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the Carnival of Venice, Cologne Carnival, the New Orleans Mardi Gras, the Rio de Janeiro carnival, and the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival. The day immediately preceding Lent is variously called Mardi Gras (\\"Fat Tuesday\\"), Pancake Tuesday, or Shrove Tuesday. Sometimes, it is the peak of the pre-Lenten festival, while sometimes it is largely occupied with preparations for Lent. The observances vary from culture to culture, and even from town to town. Originally, in Lebanon and Syria, the last Thursday preceding Lent was called \\"Khamis el zakara\\". For Catholics, it was meant to be a day of remembrance of the dead ones. However, zakara (which means \\"remembrance\\", in Arabic) was gradually replaced by sakara (meaning \\"getting drunk\\" in Arabic), and so the occasion came to be known as Khamis el sakara, wherein celebrants indulge themselves with alcoholic beverages. Fasting and abstinence Jesus Tempted in the Wilderness (J√©sus tent√© dans le d√©sert), James Tissot, Brooklyn Museum Fasting during Lent was more prominent in ancient times than today. Socrates Scholasticus reports that in some places, all animal products were strictly forbidden, while various others permitted fish, or fish and fowl, others prohibited fruit and eggs, and still others permitted only bread. In many places, the observant abstained from food for a whole day until the evening, and at sunset, Western Christians traditionally broke the Lenten fast, which was often known as the Black Fast. In India and Pakistan, many Christians continue this practice of fasting until sunset on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, with some fasting in this manner throughout the whole season of Lent. For Catholics before 1966, the theoretical obligation of the penitential fast throughout Lent except on Sundays was to take only one full meal a day. In addition, a smaller meal, called a collation, was allowed in the evening, and a cup of some beverage, accompanied by a little bread, in the morning. In practice, this obligation, which was a matter of custom rather than of written law, was not observed strictly. The 1917 Code of Canon Law allowed the full meal on a fasting day to be taken at any hour and to be supplemented by two collations, with the quantity and the quality of the food to be determined by local custom. Abstinence from meat was to be observed on Ash Wednesday and on Fridays and Saturdays in Lent. The Lenten fast ended on Holy Saturday at noon. Only those aged 21 to 59 were obliged to fast. As with all ecclesiastical laws, particular difficulties, such as strenuous work or illness, excused one from observance, and a dispensation from the law could be granted by a bishop or parish priest. A rule of thumb is that the two collations should not add up to the equivalent of another full meal. Rather portions were to be: \\"sufficient to sustain strength, but not sufficient to satisfy hunger\\". In 1966, Pope Paul VI reduced the obligatory fasting days to Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, abstinence days to Fridays and Ash Wednesday, and allowed episcopal conferences to replace abstinence and fasting with other forms of penitence such charity and piety, as declared and established in his apostolic constitution Paenitemini. This was done so that those in countries where the standard of living is lower can replace fasting with prayer, but \\"...where economic well-being is greater, so much more will the witness of asceticism have to be given...\\" This was made part of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, which made obligatory fasting for those aged between 18 and 59, and abstinence for those aged 14 and upward. The Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference decided to allow other forms of Friday penance to replace that of abstinence from meat, whether in Lent or outside Lent, suggesting alternatives such as abstaining from some other food, or from alcohol or smoking; making a special effort at participating in family prayer or in Mass; making the Stations of the Cross; or helping the poor, sick, old, or lonely. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales made a similar ruling in 1985 but decided in 2011 to restore the traditional year-round Friday abstinence from meat. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has maintained the rule of abstention from meat on Friday only during Lent and considers poultry to be a type of meat but not fish or shellfish. Many ELCA Lutheran Churches advocate fasting during designated times such as Lent,What is the holiest season of the Church Year? . Retrieved 3 February 2010. Archived copy at the Internet Archive especially on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. A Handbook for the Discipline of Lent delineates the following Lutheran fasting guidelines: However, Martin Luther criticized the Roman Catholic church of his era for creating new and stricter fasts over the preceding centuries.Commentary on the Sermon on the Mount by Martin Luther, translated by Charles A. Hay Not all Lutherans fast during lent, and churches which hold midweek services often hold dinners associated with the service.Getting the Word Out: The Alban Guide to Church Communications by Frederick H. Gonnerman, 2003. pages 102 and following The historic Methodist homilies regarding the Sermon on the Mount stress the importance of the Lenten fast, which begins on Ash Wednesday. The United Methodist Church therefore states that: Good Friday, which is towards the end of the Lenten season, is traditionally an important day of communal fasting for Methodists. Rev. Jacqui King, the minister of Nu Faith Community United Methodist Church in Houston explained the philosophy of fasting during Lent as \\"I'm not skipping a meal because in place of that meal I'm actually dining with God\\". Many of the Churches in the Reformed tradition retained the Lenten fast in its entirety. The Reformed Church in America describes the first day of Lent, Ash Wednesday, as a day \\"focused on prayer, fasting, and repentance\\" and considers fasting a focus of the whole Lenten season, as demonstrated in the \\"Invitation to Observe a Lenten Discipline\\", found in the Reformed liturgy for the Ash Wednesday service, which is read by the presider: Good Friday, which is towards the end of the Lenten season, is traditionally an important day of communal fasting for adherents of the Reformed faith. During the early Middle Ages, eggs, dairy products, and meat were generally forbidden. In favour of the traditional practice, observed both in East and West, Thomas Aquinas argued that \\"they afford greater pleasure as food [than fish], and greater nourishment to the human body, so that from their consumption there results a greater surplus available for seminal matter, which when abundant becomes a great incentive to lust.\\" Aquinas also authorized the consumption of candy during Lent, because \\"sugared spices\\" (such as comfits) were, in his opinion, digestive aids on par with medicine rather than food. Jousting against Carnival is represented by a fat man on a beer barrel who wears a huge meat pie as headdress; Lent is represented by a thin gaunt woman on a cart (shown here) bearing Lenten fare: mussels, pretzels, and waffles. Oil painting The Fight Between Carnival and Lent by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (circa 1558‚Äì1559). In Spain, the bull of the Holy Crusade (renewed periodically after 1492) allowed the consumption of dairy products and eggs during Lent in exchange for a contribution to the cause of the crusade. Giraldus Cambrensis, in his Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales, reports that \\"in Germany and the arctic regions\\", \\"great and religious persons\\" eat the tail of beavers as \\"fish\\" because of its superficial resemblance to \\"both the taste and colour of fish\\". The animal was very abundant in Wales at the time. In current Western societies the practice is considerably relaxed, though in the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic Churches, abstinence from all animal products including eggs, fish, fowl, and milk sourced from animals (e.g., cows and goats, as opposed to the milk of coconuts and soy beans) is still commonly practiced, so that, where this is observed, only vegetarian (or vegan) meals are consumed for the whole of Lent, 45 days in the Byzantine Rite. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church‚Äôs practices require a fasting period that is a great deal longer and there is some dispute over whether fish consumption is permissible. In the tradition of the Western Catholic Church, abstinence from eating some form of food (generally meat, but not dairy or fish products) is distinguished from fasting. In principle, abstinence is to be observed on Ash Wednesday and on every Friday of the year that is not a solemnity (a liturgical feast day of the highest rank); but in each country the episcopal conference can determine the form it is to take, perhaps replacing abstinence with other forms of penance.Colin B. Donovan, Fast and Abstinence. Retrieved 28 December 2007. Even during Lent, the rule about solemnities holds, so that the obligation of Friday abstinence does not apply on 19 and 25 March when, as usually happens, the solemnities of Saint Joseph and the Annunciation are celebrated on those dates. The same applies to Saint Patrick's Day, which is a solemnity in the whole of Ireland as well as in dioceses that have Saint Patrick as principal patron saint. In some other places, too, where there are strong Irish traditions within the Catholic community, a dispensation is granted for that day. In Hong Kong, where Ash Wednesday often coincides with Chinese New Year celebrations, a dispensation is then granted from the laws of fast and abstinence, and the faithful are exhorted to use some other form of penance. After the Protestant Reformation, in the Lutheran Church, \\"Church orders of the 16th century retained the observation of the Lenten fast, and Lutherans have observed this season with a serene, earnest attitude.\\" In the Anglican Churches, the Traditional Saint Augustine's Prayer Book: A Book of Devotion for Members of the Anglican Communion, a companion to the Book of Common Prayer, states that fasting is \\"usually meaning not more than a light breakfast, one full meal, and one half meal, on the forty days of Lent\\". It further states that \\"the major Fast Days of Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, as the American Prayer-Book indicates, are stricter in obligation, though not in observance, than the other Fast Days, and therefore should not be neglected except in cases of serious illness or other necessity of an absolute character.\\" Christian countries, religious processions during the season of Lent are often accompanied by a military escort both for security and parade. Ceuta, Spain Traditionally, on Sunday, and during the hours before sunrise and after sunset, some Churches, such as Episcopalians, allow \\"breaks\\" in their Lent promises. For Roman Catholics, the Lenten penitential season ends after the Easter Vigil Mass. Orthodox Christians also break their fast after the Paschal Vigil, a service which starts around 11:00 pm on Holy Saturday, and which includes the Paschal celebration of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. At the end of the service, the priest blesses cheese, eggs, flesh meats, and other items that the faithful have been abstaining from for the duration of Great Lent. Lenten traditions and liturgical practices are less common, less binding, and sometimes non-existent among some liberal and progressive Christians. A greater emphasis on anticipation of Easter Sunday is often encouraged more than the penitence of Lent or Holy Week. Some Christians as well as secular groups also interpret the Lenten fast in a positive tone, not as renunciation but as contributing to causes such as environmental stewardship and improvement of health. Even some atheists find value in the Christian tradition and observe Lent. Media coverage During Lent, BBC's Radio Four normally broadcasts a series of programmes called the Lent Talks. These 15-minute programmes are normally broadcast on a Wednesday and have featured various speakers, such as John Lennox. Holy days within the season of Lent Methodist minister distributing ashes to confirmands kneeling at the chancel rails on Ash Wednesday Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Old Jerusalem on Golgotha, Mount Calvary, where tradition claims Jesus was crucified and died There are several holy days within the season of Lent: * Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent in Western Christianity, such as the Lutheran Churches, Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, Methodist Churches, Reformed traditions, etc. * In the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite, there is no Ash Wednesday: Lent begins on the first Sunday and the fast begins on the first Monday. * The Sundays in Lent carry Latin names in German Lutheranism, derived from the beginning of the Sunday's introit. The first is called Invocabit, the second Reminiscere, the third Oculi, the fourth Laetare, the fifth Judica, the sixth Palm Sunday. * The fourth Sunday in Lent, which marks the halfway point between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday, is referred to as Laetare Sunday by Anglicans, Roman Catholics, and many other Christians, because of the traditional Entrance Antiphon of the Mass. Due to the more \\"joyful\\" character of the day (since laetare in Latin means \\"rejoice\\"), the priest, deacon, and subdeacon have the option of wearing vestments of a rose colour (pink) instead of violet. * Additionally, the fourth Lenten Sunday, Mothering Sunday, which has become known as Mother's Day in the United Kingdom and an occasion for honouring mothers of children, has its origin in a 16th-century celebration of the Mother Church. * The fifth Sunday in Lent, also known in some denominations as Passion Sunday (and in some denominations also applies to Palm Sunday) marks the beginning of Passiontide. * The sixth Sunday in Lent, commonly called Palm Sunday, marks the beginning of Holy Week, the final week of Lent immediately preceding Easter. * Wednesday of Holy Week, Holy Wednesday (also sometimes known as Spy Wednesday) commemorates Judas Iscariot's bargain to betray Jesus. * Thursday of Holy Week is known as Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday, and is a day Christians commemorate the Last Supper shared by Christ with his disciples. * The next day is Good Friday, on which Christians remember Jesus' crucifixion, death, and burial. *Saint Patrick's Day (March 17) always falls within Lent. The patron saint of Ireland, his solemnity is often considered a \\"day off\\" for Irish people during their Lenten fast.https://cruxnow.com/commentary/2017/03/time-end-game-st-patricks-day- lent/ =Easter Triduum= In the Anglican, Lutheran, Old Catholic, Roman Catholic, and many other churches, the Easter Triduum is a three-day event that begins Maundy Thursday evening, with the entrance hymn of the Mass of the Lord's Supper. After this celebration, the consecrated Hosts are taken solemnly from the altar to a place of reposition, where the faithful are invited to meditate in the presence of the consecrated Hosts.This is the Church's response to Jesus' question to the disciples sleeping in the Garden of Gethsemane, \\"Could you not watch with me one hour?\\" On the next day, the liturgical commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ is celebrated at 3 pm, unless a later time is chosen due to work schedules. This service consists of readings from the Scriptures, especially John the Evangelist's account of the Passion of Jesus, followed by prayers, veneration of the cross of Jesus, and a communion service at which the hosts consecrated at the evening Mass of the day before are distributed. The Easter Vigil during the night between Holy Saturday afternoon and Easter Sunday morning starts with the blessing of a fire and a special candle, and with readings from Scripture associated with baptism. Then, the Gloria in Excelsis Deo is sung, water is blessed, baptism and confirmation of adults may take place, the people are invited to renew the promises of their own baptism, and finally, Mass is celebrated in the usual way from the Preparation of the Gifts onwards. Holy Week and the season of Lent, depending on denomination and local custom, end with Easter Vigil at sundown on Holy Saturday or on the morning of Easter Sunday. It is custom for some churches to hold sunrise services which include open air celebrations in some places. Vestments The chancel of a Lutheran church decorated with red paraments, the liturgical colour of the last week of Lent, Holy Week, in the Lutheran and Anglican Churches In the Lutheran, Methodist, Reformed, Roman Catholic, and many Anglican churches, the pastor's vestments are violet during the season of Lent. Roman Catholic priests wear white vestments on solemnity days for St. Joseph (March 19) and the Annunciation (March 25), although these solemnities get transferred to another date if they fall on a Sunday in Lent or at any time during Holy Week. On the fourth Sunday in Lent, rose-coloured (pink) vestments may be worn in lieu of violet. Historically, black had also been used: Pope Innocent III declared black to be the proper color for Lent, though Durandus of Saint-Pour√ßain claims violet has preference over black.Kellner, K. A. H. (1908). Heortology: A History of the Christian Festivals from Their Origin to the Present Day Kegan Paul Trench Trubner & Co Limited. p. 430. In some Anglican churches, a type of unbleached linen or muslin known as \\"Lenten array\\" is worn during the first three weeks of Lent, crimson is worn during Passiontide, and on holy days, the colour proper to the day is worn.The Church of England rubric states: \\"The colour for a particular service should reflect the predominant theme. If the Collect, Readings, etc. on a Lesser Festival are those of the saint, then either red (for a martyr) or white is used; otherwise, the colour of the season is retained.\\" See p. 532 here. In certain other Anglican churches, as an alternative to violet for all of Lent except Holy Week and red beginning on Palm Sunday through Holy Saturday, Lenten array, typically made of sackcloth such as burlap and trimmed with crimson cloth, often velvet, is worn, even during Holy Week‚Äîsince the sackcloth represents penance and the crimson edges represent the Passion of Christ. Even the veils that cover the altar crosses or crucifixes and statuary (if any) are made of the same sackcloth with the crimson trim.

He was married to Eva Funck and they have a son Gustav. Early career Funck, who started out writing literature aimed for adults, has claimed to never have had any permanent employment. During the 1940s he primarily worked as a guitar teacher. He performed his original songs in Norwegian radio on guitar. During this time he began to have stories sold, in order to have them read and performed on Swedish radio as well.\\"Svenskfilmdatabas' entry on the animated film with partial biography.\\" (in Swedish) Swedish Film Institute Charlie Strapp and Froggy Ball Charlie Strapp and Froggy Ball had appeared as parts of Swedish radio shows since the mid 40s, but portrayed by regular actors. In the early 50s Funck started to do the voice of Charlie Strapp. The big breakthrough came in 1954, when all voices for the first time were provided by Funck himself, only with help of a guitar for sound effects. The radio performances were followed by several records with the same concept, a cartoon drawn by Nils Egerbrandt and from 1955 a series of books with illustrations by Einar Norelius. In 1956 a musical film also came out of it, Charlie Strap, Froggy Ball and Their Friends (Kalle Stropp, Grodan Boll och deras v√§nner), with actors in costumes miming while Funck provided the voices. Some parts were also animated with dolls.\\"Svenskfilmdatabas' entry on the first film.\\" (in Swedish) Swedish Film Institute After the 1950s, interest allegedly seemed to fade, but then the 1970s saw a revival of the characters after appearing on radio again.

The Tbilisi Marriott Hotel is a luxury five-star Marriott hotel in Tbilisi, Georgia, located in 13 Rustaveli Avenue, the city's main boulevard. It was built as a high-class hotel on the commission of the wealthy Armenian merchant Mikael Aramyants from 1911 to 1915.  History  The hotel, intended to become the best in Tbilisi, then capital of the Russian-ruled Georgia and the larger Caucasus region, was designed by Aleksandr Ozerov in 1911 and later remodeled by Gabriel Ter-Mikelov at the behest of Mikael Aramyants. Its construction was completed in 1915 and named H√¥tel Majestic. During World War I, from 1915 to 1917, the hotel accommodated a military hospital before it could be opened for the public. After the Soviet takeover of Georgia in 1921, the building was transferred to the Trade Unions. Its ground floor was used for multiple purposes, housing a typography and shops, while a basement was turned into a cinema. In February 1939, the refurbished building was restored to its original function as Hotel Tbilisi run by the state-owned travel agency Intourist. Heavily damaged by fire during the December 1991‚ÄìJanuary 1992 coup d'etat, a prelude to the Georgian Civil War, it was reconstructed under the guidance of the architects G. Metreveli and V. Kurtishvili from 1995 to 2002. On 26 September 2002, the Tbilisi Marriott Hotel was opened in the building.  Architecture and facilities  The hotel is a seven-story building, with five stories above ground. Its lavish fa√ßades retain their original design, utilizing elements of the Renaissance and Baroque architecture, such as rustification, massive semi- circular and flat pilasters with Corinthian capitals, and triangular and circular pediments rested upon stone brackets. Large columns accentuate the front entrance, facing Rustaveli Avenue. The main fa√ßade also contains a massive entablature and attic, with a moulded balustrade parapet. The hotel offers 110 rooms and 17 suites, including one vice-presidential and two presidential, as well as 8 conferences halls, lobby bar, restaurants, patio, a wellness centre for fitness, and other facilities.

The Sprague Committee‚Äôs staff included representatives of the White House, Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. Department of Defense, Department of State, and the United States Information Agency. The Committee also employed several consultants. The Sprague Committee held the first of 18 formal meetings on February 29-March 1, 1960, and met for the last time on December 27, 1960. The Committee took over nine months to complete its business and experienced some delays and complications stemming from the 1960 presidential campaign. In October 1960 the White House felt compelled to refute an allegation that the Sprague Committee had drawn conclusions regarding the status of the United States‚Äô prestige abroad, a political issue during the campaign. On December 23, 1960, the Sprague Committee submitted its finished product, \\"Conclusions and Recommendations of the President‚Äôs Committee on Information Activities Abroad,\\" to President Eisenhower. This report called for substantial expansion of the United States‚Äô information efforts, especially in such developing areas as Africa and Latin America. The Committee urged extensive training of government personnel in informational and psychological aspects of policy, recommended increased assistance to educational development abroad, and expansion of exchange programs including those with the Soviet Bloc, and pointed out the need to pay attention to the impact on foreign opinion of U.S. economic, scientific and military programs and activities. It also suggested that United States diplomacy place more emphasis on public opinion during the conduct of negotiations and conferences, the selection of foreign service personnel and in the treatment of foreign visitors. Finally, the Committee also urged that the Operations Coordinating Board be continued and strengthened. The seemingly perpetual cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union was undoubtedly the primary reason for the establishment of the Sprague Committee and clearly influenced the tone of the report and the nature of the recommendations. The Committee was particularly concerned with Soviet influence in underdeveloped countries. Committee members * Mansfield D. Sprague, Chairman * Charles Douglas Jackson * Philip D.

Now it houses the nursing home.  History  First mentioned in 1292 as \\"Castrum Czwickaw\\", it was badly damaged in a fire in 1403, and demolished between 1404 and 1407 under William I, Margrave of Meissen. It was rebuilt during the reign of Christian I, Elector of Saxony in 1587-1590 as a magnificent Renaissance castle. In the 18th century Zwickau Prison (Zuchthaus Zwickau) was established in the castle, which with interruptions, was used until after the Second World War. There were numerous prominent prisoners, including Karl May, August Bebel, Rosa Luxemburg and Martin Hoop. During the Second World War, it was used as a concentration camp.The Brecht yearbook, \\"concentration camp Schloss Osterstein\\" On 31 December 1962, after 187 years, the use of the castle as a prison ended, although a public bathhouse continued to operate in an intermediate wing of modern construction, on the Dr.-Friedrich-Ring. The former arsenal and the cell block were used to house the archives of the local coal mining industry, and for storage by various local businesses. Parts of the premises were demolished. From the 1980s, the castle structure deteriorated rapidly. During the 1990s and into the early years of the 21st century, proposals for its reuse and plans for reconstruction and redevelopment repeatedly came to nothing. The castle became increasingly a blot on the urban landscape of Zwickau town centre, and a cause of civic embarrassment. After 2000 emergency measures were required to secure the building's safety. On 3 November 2006 the foundation stone was laid for the reconstruction of the castle. The work was undertaken by GP Schuppertbau GmbH, who after repair, restoration and rebuilding converted the former castle into a nursing home, with future plans for some parts of the complex for restaurant and museum use. On 9 September 2007 the topping-out ceremony took place. On 7 November 2008 the keys were formally handed over to the Betreibergesellschaft Senioren- und Seniorenpflegeheim GmbH Zwickau, the company that runs the old people's home and nursing home; the first residents moved in on 11 November 2008.

Resistance measurement The boxes were used in the United Kingdom by engineers from then General Post Office, who were responsible for UK telecommunications to trace electrical faults, i.e. to determine where a break occurred in a cable which could be several miles in length. It works on the principle of Wheatstone bridge to identify the resistance of wire connected and then by using wire resistivity and cross section calculating length of wire and thus determining where the cable had broken. Post office boxes were common pieces of scientific apparatus in the UK O-Level and A-Level schools public examination physics syllabus in the 1960s. Construction A typical post office box is in a wooden box with a hinged lid and a metal or bakelite panel showing circuit connections.

Poehlke was a police officer in the German state of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, who murdered three motorists and used their cars in bank robberies across the state. He was dubbed 'Der Hammerm√∂rder' (The Hammer- Killer) because of his use of sledgehammers during the robberies, although his identity would not be revealed until after his suicide. Poehlke had also shot dead his wife and another son, Adrian, before fleeing with Gabriel to Italy; police found their bodies at the family home in Backnang three days prior to Poehlke's suicide.

Currently, the line connects Attaba in east-central Cairo with El-Shams Club to the northeast. The line will eventually extend from the northwest of the Greater Cairo area at Imbaba to the northeast serving Cairo International Airport. The line will cross the River Nile twice at the western branch between Kit Kat and Zamalek and the eastern branch between Zamalek and downtown Cairo. The total length of the line will be approximately 30.6 km of which 28.1 km is an underground section and the rest of the line about 2.5 km shall be on grade and will be implemented in four phases. The project includes a main workshop adjacent to the western terminal of the line and a light repair workshop at the middle of the line at Abbassia station. The line will use trains manufactured in Japan by Kinki Sharyo Co. and Toshiba Corp. When construction began, residents of the historic island of Zamalek suspected a botched and corrupt feasibility study, and were concerned the heritage and embassy buildings of the neighbourhood would be at risk of collapse. A complaint was filed to the European Investment Bank, in whose interest it was to finance the project in order to profit French companies Bouygues, Thales and Vinci , in a clear conflict of interests, who unilaterally dismissed the residents‚Äô concerns as unfounded. Their fears were nevertheless confirmed on 26 July 2020, when the buildings around one of the construction sites began to subside and had to be evacuated immediately. Included in these buildings at immediate risk are the Bahraini, Algerian, and Spanish embassies. This incident had been anticipated by the community following the news of a 10 meter deep sinkhole swallowing a whole street during the very first phase of construction, as early as 2009. Construction Construction began in 2006, with the first section opening on February 21, 2012. The line is planned to compromise of 39 stations, 26 tunnel stations, 11 elevated stations and 2 at-grade stations. The whole line (except for the Heliopolis Square-Cairo International Airport branch) is set to be completed by November 2022. The implementation of Line No. 3 started with the Attaba to Abbasia section, the first phase, followed by the second phase from Abbasia to Heliopolis, which are the most urgent sections for the transportation needs. The design of phase 1 is taking into consideration the safe crossing of two major underground structures; namely, the line 2 bored tunnel at Attaba and the wastewater spine tunnel north of Attaba. It is also planned that some of the underground stations will be extensively used as commercial centres. These stations will be constructed by the cut-and-cover method and the rolling stock will be fed by power through a third rail. Orascom Construction Industries won the tender for 1 billion EGP for the construction of the first phase of the project. The line has trains supplied by a joint venture of Kinki Sharyo and Toshiba and a contactless fare collection system and integrated supervision and communication system supplied by the Thales Group. France provided a 280 million dollar loan for the second phase of the project to French companies involved in the project. Phase 1 was opened on 21 February 2012 which ran from Attaba Station to Abbassia Station. This first phase includes five underground stations (Attaba, Bab El Shaaria, El Geish, Abdou Pasha and Abbassia) and serves the eastern part of Cairo from the city centre. 3,500 people, including 85 expatriate staff, worked on this project, which took 51 months to complete. The project was built by a consortium, led by VINCI Construction Grands Projets, comprising Bouygues Travaux Publics, Orascom and Arab Contractors. The first phase cost a total of 4.2 billion LE ($700 million) and will transport between 250,000 and 300,000 passengers per day. Phase 1 civil engineering contract covered construction of a 4.3 km tunnel section and five stations. Meanwhile, VINCI subsidiary ETF- Eurovia Travaux Ferroviaires led the consortium responsible for the track works package. This included the supply and laying of 11 km of track and the power rail in the tunnel. In September 2009, work on the phase 1 was delayed after a landslide hit the construction site on Al-Gueich Street. Phase 2 was opened on 7 May 2014, and led by consortium with VINCI, Bouygues Travaux Publics, Orascom and Arab Contractors which is 7.2 km tunnel. Construction work on Phase 2 began in mid-2009 and it runs from Abbassiya Station till Al Ahram Station in Heliopolis, with five stations to be constructed, Fair Zone, Cairo Stadium, Koleyet El Banat, Al Ahram and Haroun.http://akhbarelyom.org.eg/news119172_1.aspx The costs of this phase about (498M‚Ç¨) and was financed by French Development Agency(44M‚Ç¨), French ministry of finance (R√âSERVE PAYS EMERGENTS) (200M‚Ç¨) and Government of Egypt (1.5 billion EGP) with French Fund for Global Environment (1M‚Ç¨) grant.

Bats was founded in June 2005, became operator of a licensed U.S. stock exchange in 2008 and opened its pan-European stock market in October 2008. As of February 2016, it operated four U.S. stock exchanges, two U.S. equity options exchanges, the pan-European stock market, and a global market for the trading of foreign exchange products. Bats is now owned by Cboe Global Markets. History The company was founded in June 2005 by Dave Cummings, a computer programmer. Cummings said he was inspired to start the company after observing Archipelago Holdings be acquired by the New York Stock Exchange and Instinet be acquired by NASDAQ within a week of each other in 2005. After the launch of Bats, other brokerage firms, hedge funds, and other clients became involved with the company. Cummings publicized the Bats service by sending emails to companies highlighting the niche that could be carved out by trading on platforms other than the big two‚ÄîNASDAQ and NYSE. The niche that he sought for the company was for it to be \\"a neutral, private, broker-dealer owned, semi-profitable utility\\" with no party owning more than 20 percent. He noted that the consolidation of the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ eliminated competition and they raised prices for their services. The Bats system was intended to charge less. Among the items it did to draw customers was to offer free listings to companies with shares that traded a certain amount each day. Cummings stepped down in 2007 and was replaced by Joe Ratterman who had been associated with the company from the start. Cummings said in his resignation, \\"As Bats prepares to become an exchange, my ownership of a broker-dealer precludes me from serving in management\\". Cummings returned to his position as CEO at Tradebot. =European expansion= Under the leadership of Joe Ratterman, in March 2008, Bats entered the European equities markets by establishing a multilateral trading facility (MTF) to compete on a pan- European basis against the incumbent securities exchanges. Bats Europe was formally launched in October 2008. In February 2011, Bats Global Markets agreed to buy Chi-X Europe, a competitor and largest pan-European MTF at the time, for $300 million. The deal was referred by the Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission in June 2011 for further investigation to \\"determine whether a substantial lessening of competition is probable as a result of the anticipated merger\\". However, the Competition Commission approved the transaction in late November 2011, leading to Bats closing the deal on 30 November 2011. In April 2011, Bats Global Markets confirmed that Mark Hemsley, CEO of Bats Europe, will be appointed CEO of the combined entity following Bats‚Äô acquisition of Chi-X Europe. By April 2012 the technology integration between the two platforms was complete and Chi-X Europe customers were migrated onto the Bats Europe platform. =Initial public offering= Also under the leadership of Joe Ratterman, the company attempted to go public on March 23, 2012, as the first listing on its own exchange, but later withdrew the IPO the same day due to a disastrous glitch in the company's trading systems. The glitch resulted in Bats‚Äô stock price falling from the original $16 offering price to as low as 4¬¢ a share. Three erroneous Apple trades on the Bats exchange triggered a circuit breaker which temporarily halted trading in that stock. Those trades were later canceled. Bats halted stocks on its exchange that were affected by the glitch and included stocks with ticker symbols beginning with letters A to BFZZZ. It later reopened trading in the affected symbols but decided to withdraw the Bats stock offering. Following the failed IPO, the Bats board of directors decided to separate the roles of chairman and CEO. Joe Ratterman had previously held both roles. Ratterman received the ‚Äúunanimous support‚Äù of the directors to retain the positions of CEO and president. In July 2012, Bats named Paul Atkins, a former U.S. Securities and Exchange commissioner, to the role of non-executive chairman of its board of directors. =System issue= In January 2013, Bats admitted that what it called a \\"system issue\\" had generated problems with more than 400,000 trades, going back as far as 2008. Specifically, it admitted that prices had been executed that were ‚Äúequal to or less than the so-called national best bid and offer price‚Äù, in violation of Reg NMS. =Acquisition by CBOE= In September 2016, it was announced that Bats was to be acquired in early 2017 by CBOE Holdings, which will pay about US$3.2 billion for it. The transaction closed on March 1, 2017 Operations=United States= In the United States Bats operated two stock exchanges, the BZX Exchange and the BYX Exchange (The Bats Exchanges), which as of 2012 accounted for about 10-12% of all U.S. equity trading on a daily basis. BZX and BYX are different chiefly because of their pricing structure and the BZX is almost four times bigger than the BYX. At that time, Bats was the third largest stock exchange operator in the United States. In November 2008, Bats converted its ECN to a national securities exchange, BZX, which allowed Bats to participate in and earn market data fees from the United States consolidated tape plans, reduce its clearing costs, and operate a primary listings business. In February 2010, Bats expanded into a new asset class by offering trading of listed equity options on BZX. In October 2010, Bats launched BYX, a second national securities exchange for trading listed cash equity securities. Bats launched a primary listings business in the United States on its BZX Exchange in December 2010 and launched its first listings of seven ETFs in January 2012. With BYX, Bats offered a different pricing model than its larger market, BZX. =Europe= Bats entered the European equities markets in 2008, with the launch of Bats Europe, a pan-European multilateral trading facility (MTF). In 2011 it acquired Chi-X Europe, a competitor and largest pan-European MTF at the time, this was merged with Bats Europe.

It is believed to be the first football club to use United in its name. The club is a full member of the Football Association and, the Amateur Football Alliance and currently play in the ; they are an FA Charter Standard Club. It was named \\"Polytechnic\\" after the former name of the current University of Westminster (The Royal Polytechnic Institution). History The club was originally established in 1873 or 1875, and was originally called Hanover United Football Club The club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1879, entering the First round, where they met Grey Friars but lost 2‚Äì1. In 1892, under the name Polytechnic Football Club, the club became founder members of the Southern Alliance finishing fourth in the league's only year in existence. The FA Amateur Cup was also entered in 1895. The club played in the Southern Suburban League for a few seasons in the early 1900s before joining the Olympian League for the 1909‚Äì10 season. The 1911‚Äì12 season then saw the club become members of the Spartan League. The club stayed in the top division until the end of the 1928‚Äì29 season when, finishing bottom, they were relegated to Division One. However, they were subsequently relegated the next season to Division Two East. The club returned to Division One at the end of the 1935‚Äì56 season, when they finished third in the division and remained there until the Second World War. After the war the club were placed in the Western Division. The league the following season was then returned to a top division with two division underneath and the club was placed in Division One Western after finishing sixth the year before. The 1951‚Äì52 season saw the club finish as runners-up in Division One Western and gain promotion back to the Premier Division. However again they could only last one season in the top division and, after finishing bottom, were relegated. The 1953‚Äì54 season would be their last in the Spartan league with the club leaving at the end of the season to join Division Three of the Southern Amateur Football League, due to the cost of travelling expenses. The club achieved promotion to Division Two in the 1955‚Äì56 as champions of Division Three, and followed up three seasons later to the top division in the league the Senior Division One. The period of time in the top division was short lived, as they only spent the single season there, before being relegated back to Division Two. The club regained promotion back to the top division at the end of the 1961‚Äì62 season but could only survive three seasons in the top division, with one of those seasons being called off due to severe weather disruptions. The club would then spend the next 30 seasons in the lower two senior divisions before it achieved promotion again to the top division of the league at the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season. After nine seasons the club was relegated back to Division Two, but gained promotion again two seasons later at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 campaign. The club remained in the top division until the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, when they were relegated back to Senior Division Two, however gained promotion the same season. The Civil Service, along with the Football Association, celebrated their 150th anniversary. As a result, HRH Prince William invited Civil Service to play a Southern Amateur League home game at Buckingham Palace. Polytechnic FC won the game 2‚Äì1. 2015‚Äì16 and 2016‚Äì17 seasons saw the club reach new heights with the 1st XI winning the treble in each season and finally claim the honour of being the League Champions.

Also on the property are a contributing woodshed, men's and women's outhouses, and two cemeteries. During the Civil War in November 1862, White Oak Church became the center, for seven months, of an encampment of the Army of the Potomac.

Foundation from 1991 to 1994. Since 1994, the Council has been jointly funded by the Nuffield Foundation, the Medical Research Council and The Wellcome Trust on a five-year rolling system. Towards the end of each five-year period, a process of external review is a condition of continued support. Funding has been confirmed until 2022 following the satisfactory completion of the latest funding bid.Nuffield Council on Bioethics: How is the Council funded? Ethical approach The Council takes the view that its terms of reference do not require it to adopt the same ethical framework or set of principles in all reports. The Council is therefore not bound by the values of particular schools of philosophy (for example, utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics) or approaches in bioethics, such as the 'four principles of bioethics' (autonomy, justice, beneficence, non-maleficence), or the Barcelona Principles (autonomy, dignity, integrity, vulnerability).Nuffield Council on Bioethics: How does the Council ‚Äòdo‚Äô ethics? In 2006-7, John Harris, Professor of Bioethics at the University of Manchester, and Dr Sarah Chan carried out an external review of the way ethical frameworks, principles, norms and guiding concepts feature in the Council's publications.Nuffield Council on Bioethics: An external review of the Council‚Äôs ethics The authors found that the ethical frameworks used in the Council's publications had become increasingly explicit and transparent.

History  The DEISA project started as DEISA1 in 2002 developing and supporting a pan-European distributed high performance computing infrastructure. The initial project was funded by the European Commission in the sixth of the Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (FP6) from 2004 through 2008. The funding continued for the follow-up project DEISA2 in the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) through 2011. The DEISA infrastructure coupled eleven national supercomputing centres with a dedicated (mostly 10 Gbit/s) network connection provided by G√âANT2 on the European level and the national research and education networks (NRENs).  Consortium There were 11 principal partners and four associate partners.

Deisa benchmark suite DEISA produced a benchmark suite to help computer scientists assess the performance of parallel supercomputer systems. The benchmark comprises a number of real applications codes taken from a wide range of scientific disciplines. A structured framework allows compilation, execution and analysis to be configured and carried out via standard input files. The codes were chosen as representative of the scientific projects performed on the DEISA supercomputers. The codes and associated datasets were selected for benchmarking systems with peak performances ranging up to hundreds of teraflops, machines which are more powerful than a desktop personal computer by factors of tens of thousands. The suite contained codes relevant to astrophysics, fluid dynamics, climate modelling, biosciences, materials science, fusion power and fundamental particle physics. It has been run by DEISA on a range of its own supercomputers and records of the results are kept for comparison. The DEISA benchmark was used by the EU-funded PRACE project as a starting point for their investigations of benchmarks for the next generation of petaflop supercomputers.

He had a herbarium with about 60,000 fungal specimens, and described over a thousand new species of fungi.Blackwell WH, Powell MJ. (1996). \\"An analysis of works of, and upon, Curtis Gates Lloyd.\\" Mycotaxon 53: 353‚Äì374. Along with his two brothers John Uri Lloyd and Nelson Ashley Lloyd, he founded the Lloyd Library and Museum in Cincinnati. Early life Born on July 17, 1859 in Florence, Kentucky, Curtis Gates Lloyd was the third son of Nelson Marvin and Sophia Webster Lloyd. He and his family moved to Crittenden, Kentucky, in 1867, where Lloyd lived until he was 18. He moved to Cincinnati and was employed as an apprentice in Johnson's pharmacy. This was where he met Dr. John King, physician and editor of the American Dispensatory; the close friendship they formed helped to fuel Lloyd's interest in botany. Lloyd earned his pharmacy certificate while working at the pharmacy. Later, Lloyd was a salesman with Hale, Justice and Co., a drug supply company, and he began accumulating a personal collection of flowering plants. Career Lloyd, together with his brother John Uri, started publishing Drugs and Medicines of North America, a quarterly publication that became popular in the fields of botany and medicine. Two years later, he and his two brothers became owners of Lloyd Brothers Manufacturing Pharmacists; Curtis Lloyd's specialty was researching pharmaceuticals from medicinal plants. Lloyd's interest in mycology was initiated after a meeting with Andrew Price Morgan in 1887. Soon after, Lloyd directed his attention to the study of the Gasteromycetes, taking field trips and forays to various exotic locales, and collecting more specimens for his growing personal herbarium. In the early 1900s, Lloyd established offices in both Kew, London and in Paris, France. He began publishing his mycological findings, and quickly gained a reputation for his views on the use of personal names in the identification of fungi. He became well known for publishing tirades against the convention of citing author's names after the generic name and specific epithet of plants and fungi, a practice he called \\"species- grinding\\".Jorcan DS. (1927). Concerning \\"species-grinding\\". Science 66(1696): 14 15. Because he published privately, Lloyd was free to criticize other mycologists guilty of hastily publishing new species. In the article \\"The Myths of Mycology\\" (1917) he wrote, > ... the mistakes, blunders, and personal foibles of mycological writers have > been my chief source of pleasure. I have never failed to express myself > plainly, and have spared neither friend nor antagonist. I have always tried > to be good-natured in my comments, and as a general thing the parties > affected are taking it more as a joke on themselves and an idiosyncrasy of > myself. ... Nor am I deceiving myself into the belief that I will accomplish > what I am trying to bring about, the abolition of personal advertisements in > mycology. His conservative approach to classification was later criticized by Marinus Anton Donk, who wrote \\"The terror that Lloyd spread among North American mycologists and abroad by ridiculing everything that reminded him of taxonomic innovation in the systematics of fungi ... has not yet been completely overcome. His slipshod taxonomic methods were accepted as standard by some of his correspondents.\\" Lloyd spent much of the latter half of his career working on the polypore fungi, of which he amassed an extensive collection later described by Josiah L. Lowe as \\"undoubtedly the best single source of information on the species of the world.\\" In 1926, plagued by failing eyesight, Lloyd was forced to retire from his mycological work, and returned to Crittenden, where he lived until his death from complications of diabetes, on November 6, 1926. Most of his wealth was placed in endowment with the Lloyd Library and Museum. Publications He published 26 issues of The Bulletin of the Lloyd Library; six of these were written by him on mycological subjects. He also published 75 issues of Mycological Notes over a period of 28 years (1898-1925).Fitzpatrick HM. (1927). Curtis Gates Lloyd. Mycologia 19(4): 153‚Äì159. *(1908).

She is an Australian national champion, an Olympian and two-time World Champion. She contested state representative events (firstly for Queensland and later for South Australia) at nine successive Australian Rowing Championships. Club and state rowing Houston was born in Queensland. Her senior rowing was done from the Toowong Rowing Club in Brisbane, the University of Queensland Boat Club (UQBC) and later when she relocated to South Australia from the Adelaide University Boat Club. Houston began contesting Australian national lightweight sculling events at the Australian Championships in 2001 initially for Toowong. In 2004 in UQBC colours she won the national title in a double scull WLWT2X history at Austn Cships She achieved the national triple in 2005 wearing Adelaide Uni colours winning the single sculls title and at stroke in both the double scull and the quad scull. She repeated the twosome in 2006 and 2007 (the double & quad) with Amber Halliday in the stroke seat. In 2008 Houston won another national title in the lightweight quad. Houston was first selected to represent Queensland in the women's Interstate Youth Eight Championship contesting the Bicentennial Cup at the 2000 Australian Rowing Championships. From 2001 Houston raced in Queensland representative lightweight women's crews who contested the Victoria Cup at the Interstate Regatta. She rowed in those quad sculls successively from 2001 to 2006; at stroke for the last three of those events. By 2007 Houston had relocated to South Australia to train with and aim for world championship success with Amber Halliday. In 2007 she was selected in the South Australian women's lightweight quad and at that year's Australian Championships she saw her first Victoria Cup victory at the Interstate Regatta rowing in the two seat behind Halliday. In 2008 she stroked the South Australian quad to victory in that same event. Notably, from 2005 to 2008 Houston contested all four events available to a female lightweight sculler at the Australian Rowing Championships ‚Äì the single, the double, the quad national title and the quad interstate championship. She was victorious in ten of those sixteen races and twice placed second. International representative rowing Houston made her first Australian representative appearance at the 2002 World Rowing Cup II in Lucerne, Switzerland. That year she was picked in the lightweight quad scull to contest the 2002 World Rowing Championships in Seville. In a crew with Zita van de Walle, Miranda Bennett and Hannah Every- Hall, Houston won the gold, her first World Championship title and set a new world record in the process. At Milan 2003 Houston again raced in the Australian lightweight quad. They won the bronze medal. Australia qualified a lightweight double scull for the Athens Olympics in 2004 being Sally Newmarch and Amber Halliday. There is no lightweight quad raced at the Olympics and Houston missed selection in Australia's boat for the lightweight 2004 World Rowing Championships. Her 2004 international rowing was therefore restricted to that year's World Rowing Cup III at Lucerne where she placed eight in the double-scull with Sally Newmarch. For the 2005 World Rowing Championships at Gifu, Japan Houston raced for Australia in the lightweight double scull with Kirsty Fleming. They placed sixth. Still in the lightweight double-scull for the 2006 World Rowing Championships in Eton, Dorney but now paired with Halliday, Houston had greater success as they won the silver. They stayed together in that same boat the following year for Munich 2007 where Houston and Halliday won the gold bringing Marguerite's second and Amber's third world championship title.Houston at World Rowing References * 1981 births Living people Australian female rowers Olympic rowers of Australia Rowers at the 2008 Summer Olympics World Rowing Championships medalists for Australia People educated at All Hallows' School ","title":"Marguerite Houston"},{"id":"21325484","text":"M√°ria Melov√°-Henkel (born 21 October 1975) is a retired Slovak high jumper.

The bridge crosses the tip of Ada Ciganlija island, connecting the municipalities of ƒåukarica and New Belgrade. The bridge pylon is located on the tip of the island, which has been reinforced with large amounts of concrete and has been slightly enlarged to provide stronger foundations. Construction began in 2008, and the bridge opened on 1 January 2012. Adjoining roads were completed in 2013. Immediately after the design has been announced, it polarized both the professionals and politicians. Those who were in favor of the bridge claimed it is the most beautiful and the most functional of all Belgrade bridges, while those against it called it a megalomaniacal, too expensive and unnecessary. Still, since its opening in 2012, the bridge became one of the symbols of the city and \\"inescapable d√©cor in music videos and movies\\", but also in video cards, commercials, etc. It is referred to as the \\"most representative bridge in the capital\\".  Location  Ada Bridge is the most upstream Belgrade bridge over the Sava river within the urban area. The bridge provides the only direct connection between the New Belgrade (Blokovi) and ƒåukarica (Banovo Brdo) municipalities. The bridge pylon is located on the tip of the Ada Ciganlija island.  History  Ada bridge in front of other Belgrade bridges In 1923, architect ƒêorƒëe Kovaljevski created the first urbanization plan of the area that envisaged a bridge over Ada Ciganlija. The initial idea of what is today known as the Belgrade Inner City Semi-Ring Road, to which the bridge is an important part, were created at that time. This road was part of several plans under different names such as the Main Ring Road, Transverse Road, Eastern Tangent Road, each with slightly different routes. All the plans had one thing in common: the Ada Ciganlija Bridge. In early plans the bridge was placed closer to the Lake while the final project placed the bridge on the very tip of the island due to ecological concerns over the lake. After World War II, when Belgrade was left without any motorway bridges over the Sava, this route had no precedence, as narrower and closer to downtown locations had a priority. The project was pushed aside until the early 2000s.  Name  The name was chosen by the popular vote, though the name Most na Adi (literally, Bridge on Ada) became a colloquial name for the bridge already during its construction. Novi most (New bridge) is a frequently used unofficial name for the bridge. Among the other proposed names was Harfa (the harp), because of its look. Some of the linguists asserted that the only correct version can be only Most preko Ade (Bridge across, or over, Ada) but their other colleagues said that this version is also correct.  Design  Cable-stayed design with a single pylon The competition for the preliminary design of the bridge was held in 2004. Twelve companies submitted bids, with the winning design by the Slovenian company Ponting. The bridge designers were the architects Viktor Markelj and Peter Gabrijelƒçiƒç. The winning conceptual design was unanimously selected by the jury which was chaired by Nikola Hajdin, President of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts and the architect of the New Railroad Bridge. The Belgrade Association of Architects also endorsed the project, assessing it as contemporary and relevant to the future skyline of Belgrade. The design was awarded the first prize by the Hajdin's jury in 2005 and was officially selected in 2006. The bridge is a cable-stayed design with a single pylon. The foundation for the pylon is a circular diaphragm wall with 113 bored piles. The main span is constructed from 8,600 tons of bridge construction steel (grade S355J2+N), supported by 80 stay cables, and is counterbalanced by a post-tensioned, reinforced concrete back span of . The approach towards New Belgrade is constructed as a 388m post-tensioned, reinforced concrete side span as continuous beam box girder with a similar arrangement of deck as the back span. Component parts of the deck were manufactured in China and delivered in transportable units on a sea and river-route via Rotterdam through the Rhine‚ÄìMain‚ÄìDanube Canal to the pre- assembly yard next to the construction site at Mala Ciganlija in Belgrade. The stay cables used to support the bridge deck have a maximum length of approximately , and in total 1280 tons of high grade steel is used for the 80 cables with up to 91 strands. The bridge is designed to significantly reduce traffic passing through the city centre, up to 40%, and the older Gazela Bridge. The traffic over the bridge is projected at 12,000 vehicles per hour. There is also a possibility that it will be used for the future Belgrade Metro lines. It is also planned to be part of the future Belgrade Inner City Semi- Ring Road. It will have three road lanes and a tram (light rail) track in each direction.  Construction = Bridge = Pylon under construction, May 2010 According to the original, \\"most optimistic\\" plans, the bridge was to be finished in 2008. However, it was a year when the construction began. In December 2008 the main works started on the right bank of the Sava, when the testing piers for the first pillar, out of seven in total. The deadline was 40 months and the projected cost ‚Ç¨118 million. It soon became apparent that the price will be higher while the problems showed on the ground. Several constructors went bankrupt and it appeared that the deadline might be extended a lot. However, the construction continued as planned and the two sides of the bridge were connected in August 2011. Later that year the construction ended and the bridge was opened to public traffic on 1 January 2012 at 00:00, when crowds of citizens and tourists gathered, crossing over it. The design envisioned the grid-like cone to be placed on top of the pylon, but as of September 2018 it appears that the idea was scrapped altogether. In May 2012, the placement of the cone carried by a helicopter was attempted, but due to the strong winds the operation was aborted and rescheduled for some other time. After the government change in 2013, it was claimed that the entire new paperwork was needed to install the top, but nothing has been done. = Other parts of the project = Though in use since January 2012, by December 2017 the official exploitation permit still hasn't been issued for the bridge. In the summer of 2017, the bridge was connected to the To≈°in Bunar Street, via the newly constructed boulevard which was named after the combatants in the 1998 Battle of Ko≈°are. As of January 2018 there are still three major construction undertakings for the bridge to become fully functional as projected and to fulfill its intended purpose. The ventures include the tram tracks laying, construction of the road connections towards the neighborhood of Rakovica and drilling of the Topƒçider tunnel. In 2016, city officials announced that the first trams will cross over the bridge in 2017. But a request for tender, concerning the construction of the tram tracks over the bridge, was distributed by the city government only in December 2016, and it failed. It was repeated in December 2017. The project included of a new, dual gauge tracks, with connections to the existing routes in New Belgrade and Banovo Brdo. Deadline for the tender was January 2018, so the trams should become operational in 2019. From the New Belgrade side, the connection was made at the ƒêorƒëa Stanojeviƒáa Street, continuing over the embankment and the northern access road to the center of the bridge. On ƒåukarica side, it was connected to the existing route at the border of Banovo Brdo and Rakovica. Places for the future additional tram stations, right at the ending points of the bridge, were already allocated. Among the other additional works, the already existing elevated track across the Topƒçiderka river, was removed but the pillars were preserved and used for the new track bridge. Some preparatory works began in March 2018 and later that month city signed a contract with \\"Energoprojekt holding\\", which won the bidding. Construction was to last for 420 days. After a month-long testing, the tram traffic across the bridge started on 4 July 2019. Initially, two lines crossed the bridge: No. 11L (Ta≈°majdan-Block 45) and No. 13 (Banovo Brdo-Block 45). However, six months after the opening, works on the tracks continued, while the new tender in December 2019 revealed numerous flaws in the previous project, citing \\"incomprehensible reasons\\".Belgrade's Construction Directory invitation to tender (in Serbian) The construction of the road connection with Rakovica includes the relocation of the Topƒçiderka riverbed for , construction of a new bridge across the Pere Velimiroviƒáa Steeet in Rakovica's neighborhood of Kanarevo Brdo and reconstruction and widening of the Bulevar patrijarha Pavla which is designated to be the most important traffic route in this part of Belgrade. It is envisioned as the main transit corridor which would connect the European route E75 (Belgrade-Ni≈° highway), New Belgrade, Ada Bridge, Patrijarha Dimitrija Street, Ibar Highway, Kru≈æni put and the Belgrade bypass. As of January 2018, the timeline of this project is unknown, as only a partial request for tendering was announced. The works on the relocation of the river began on 1 March 2018, and the road bridge became operational on 22 March 2019. For the Topƒçider tunnel, which would directly connect the bridge with Autokomanda interchange on the European route E75, the detailed regulatory plan and the conceptual design are finished and the tendering for the project was announced for later in 2018. The bridge was finally granted the exploitation permit in December 2019, after already being in use for 8 years. = Contractors = The construction was commissioned by the Belgrade Land Development Public Agency and co-financed by the City of Belgrade, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank and several private financiers. The contract for a Project Manager and Engineer was awarded to Louis Berger Group. Their job was to provide support to the City of Belgrade in all aspects of project cycle management, including design review, preparation of works documentation, procurement, works supervision and contract administration. Engineering and construction of the bridge was awarded to a consortium of three companies, Porr AG from Austria, Slovenija ceste Tehnika from Slovenia and DSD Br√ºckenbau GmbH from Germany. The consortium engaged several subcontractors, including Leonhardt, Andr√§ und Partner from Germany, China Railway Shanhaiguan Bridge Group from China, Vorspann Technik from Germany, BBR from Switzerland, the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Mining and Geology, Eusani-Hortmanns-Zahlten Ingenieurgesellschaft from Germany, Ponting from Slovenia, BBV from Germany and the Institute Kirilo Saviƒá from Belgrade. The North Approach Road's detailed design was by Hidroprojekt ‚Äì saobraƒáaj from Belgrade. the South Approach Road's detailed design was by Centar za puteve Vojvodine from Novi Sad, and the Pa≈°troviceva Street detailed design was by IM Projekt from Belgrade.  Controversies  As soon as the design was revealed, criticism of the project began. Everything about the bridge was disapproved, starting with the location itself, which some labeled as wrong. The environmentalists claimed it will destroy the habitat of the pygmy cormorant, which winters in great numbers on the Ada Ciganlija and the ƒåukarica Bay. The size was also denounced and the bridge was labeled as a megalomaniacal project. The general appearance and the price of the bridge were blasted with questions being asked about the design (why it has a high pylon or the stays) or it has been proclaimed as unnecessary in general. Only when it was open for traffic, it was announced that the total costs of the project, including the access roads and interchanges will be over ‚Ç¨400 million. Also, it was clear that the bridge won't work in its full capacity for a long time as numerous other parts of the projects remained unfinished or just on the paper.  In popular culture  Ada bridge was featured in the fifth episode of season nine of the Discovery Channel documentary television series Build It Bigger. The bridge became one of the symbols of Belgrade. It became a \\"must\\" in the music videos, TV serials or movies shot in Belgrade. It is filmed in numerous commercials, video cards and photo shoots.

It was based upon the novel of the same name by Peter B. Kyne. The film was the last independent picture for Walsh's production company, and the last film he and Cooper would make together. Today it is one of Walsh's earliest surviving features, and is one of only two non-D. W. Griffith features of Cooper's that still is known to survive. Plot As described in a film magazine, upon discovering that her husband is a bigamist with a son, Nan (Cooper) goes back with her infant son to her father. She of course is ostracized by the local church people. When Donald McKaye (Graves) returns from college, he is the first to give her sympathy and understanding. Young McKaye loves Nan and wants to marry her, but his father, The Laird of Tyee (Belmore), has other more ambitious plans for his son and his mother and sisters resent the idea of the mother of a nameless child becoming the wife of the McKaye heir. Nan is ready to give him up, and when Donald yields to his father's wishes and goes to a mountain hut to think it over, she slips away. Donald falls victim to a fever and is taken to a hospital. After resorting to everything else, the mother swallows her pride and sends for Nan, for whom Donald calls constantly. Her presence restores him. The family gives her a cold \\"thank you\\" which drives Donald to the final break with his father. He marries Nan and is disinherited. The old Laird refuses to soften, even when, after the man falls into the river from a motor boat headed for the logging camp when a huge log comes down the chute and hits it, the son plunging into the river and saves the father's life. Reconciliation finally comes after a son is born to Donald and Nan.

The film still exists and was restored in 2004, is one of the few films from Walsh's early years to survive, and is also one of only two surviving films from Cooper's starring years. The film has been screened at a few film festivals since its restoration but has not been released for home video.

It is located in the city center of Jaffa, and it is one of the 7 towers erected in the cities of Palestine in the year 1901 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Sultan Abdul Hamid II ascending the Ottoman throne. It is considered one of the most important Ottoman Islamic architectural monuments in the city and still is today. Its construction was completed in 1906 and the name was taken from the name of Sultan Abdul Hamid. It was built with the contributions of the local residents, Jews and Muslim. The Jaffa Clock Tower is one of seven clock towers built in Palestine during the Ottoman period. The others are located in Safed, Acre, Nazareth, Haifa, Nablus. Jerusalem also had a clock tower built during the Ottoman period, but it has not survived to the present day because the British army, who occupied the area until 1948, demolished it. History The construction of the tower was initiated by Moritz Schoenberg, a Jewish businessman and clockmaker who also built the adjacent Bustrus St. (now Raziel St.) to commemorate the silver jubilee of the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The tower was built with contributions of the residents of the city, Arabs and Jews, headed by Joseph Bey Moyal. The first stone of the tower was laid in September 1900. Within a year two floors were built and the construction of a third floor had begun. In 1903 the clock tower had been erected and Schoenberg designed and installed four clocks at its top. It is similar to the clock tower of Khan al-Umdan in Acre that is dedicated to the same purpose. More than a hundred similar clock towers were built throughout the Ottoman Empire due to this occasion. In 1966 the Jaffa Clock Tower was renovated, new clocks were installed and colorful mosaic windows designed by Arie Koren to describe the history of Jaffa were added. In 2004 the clock tower appeared on an Israeli stamp worth 1.3 sheqels. It was together with the clock towers in Safed, Acre, Haifa and Jerusalem featured in a series of Ottoman Clock Towers In Israel.

The rare book is 200 pages long and is arguably the most detailed history of an evacuation hospital in the European and North African theatres of war. There were over 40 evacuation hospital units in the European Theater of Operations, but few have published unit histories. Book The first printing in 1949, edited by Max Allen, MD was done for the unit members and only 500 copies were produced. The second edition, printed in 2008 was limited to 1,000 copies. Over 200 photographs are included, which does not include the head shots of the majority of the unit members in a \\"yearbook\\" type section filling the last pages of the volume. Early sections of the book include a view of what the injured soldier experienced from arrival through treatment and then until he is evacuated to home, another hospital or back to his unit. Unit The 77th Evacuation Hospital was formed at The University of Kansas Medical Center in 1942. Preliminary organization began earlier, but the actual unit was not drawn up until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Made up of 40 doctors, 60 nurses, and 300 enlisted men, the unit shipped out to England in May 1942. They began active operation in Oran, after the Allies invaded North Africa, and continued there and in Sicily until the surrender of all axis forces in that theatre in 1943. They returned to England and prepared for deployment on the European mainland after the anticipated invasion. On July 7, 1944 the 77th crossed the English Channel and supported the Allied troops through the end of the war. Film The documentary is 72 minutes long, has an original score, over 17 interviews with members of the unit, and never before seen color footage from World War II filmed by Mervin Rumold, MD, one of the surgeons in the unit. The making of the documentary was a four-year process for the director, Dan Ginavan. Beginning at the final reunion of the surviving members of the unit in 2004, he began filming the interviews in a small hotel room not knowing if a film would ever be made or not. Continuing on with the project and completing it with a very small staff the film premiered on Veteran's Day, 2008. The film is expected to compete in film festivals in 2009. The film won a Silver Telly in 2009 in the category of History/Biography.

Sleep Room are a relatively reclusive band whose sporadic and extraordinary live performances have won them much acclaim and a small cult following. To date, Sleep Room have made 3 albums attracting endorsement by Planet Sound and BBC radio, while winning praise for their performance at the charity event Oxjam in Reading. Their influences include a diverse range of bands, most notably Joy Division, Sigur R√≥s, Elbow and Pink Floyd. Sleep Room take their name from the conspiratorial brainwashing technique allegedly used by the CIA in the early 70's Project MKUltra which involved sensory deprivation and sub-conscious behavioural response to sound.

Following a number of gigs in and around Berkshire, Sleep Room embarked on a not so successful recording project at Sound Machine Studio's in Fleet, owned a run by a friend of Griffith's. While the record Rat's May Dream Of Maze was good enough to be given a rave review on Planet Sound, band members Weston, Cook and King felt let down by the quality and effort of the studio, feeling Griffiths and compatriot were more interested in intoxication than recording. Despite this, the record sold well, and Sleep Room began to refine their sound, working hard on new music and gigging in Guildford, Reading and Bracknell. In 2003 however, after an extended period of tension and artistic differences, Sleep Room and Oli Griffiths parted company. Weston, Cook and King overhauled the Sleep Room sound and began developing a more challenging catalogue of sounds while keeping an eye out for a replacement bass player. =Shut Window's, Draw Curtain's, and a New Found Fame (2003-2006)= While drinking in The Hope and Anchor, a pub in Wokingham, Cook came in contact with Griffiths' replacement David Treasure; a talented session musician looking to be part of something more creative than his regular fee-paying cover band work. Treasure joined the band, and following a short live stint in Reading, Sleep Room were ready with their developed sound, and new progressive material. In 2004 Sleep Room once again stepped into the recording studio, this time opting for the professional services of producer and engineer Lewis Childs and Earth Terminal in Odiham. The record, Shut Windows, Draw Curtains, was received to critical acclaim, attracting attention from BBC radio, getting regular airplay on BBC Radio Berkshire and even Gideon Coe's radio show on BBC Radio 6 where their song \\"Patriot\\" won \\"Download of the month\\" With a darker and more complex sound, the record housed some long pieces, notably the outstandingly accomplished tracks \\"Dave & Sarah\\", and \\"Brand New Day\\". Sleep Room were on a roll, and after another successful if sporadic run of live performances, they were back in the studio to record their new collection of tracks, the album - It Still Moves All The Same. This proved to be their breakthrough, and amongst even more critical acclaim, Sleep Room attracted support gigs for then signed Reading act The Cooper Temple Clause among others, and a chance to feature in the national music event the Oxjam Festival and even selling albums in America. The now distinct Sleep Room sound was captured fantastically by Childs once again at Earth Terminal, featuring some strange recording techniques. In their single \\"The Souvenir\\", a song penned in reference to the anxiety suffered by his friend during a break- up, Cook was made to stand in the roof of the barn to sing into the rafters, while Weston had his guitar kicked to spark strange atmospherics. Cook sang the entire lead vocal to the haunting \\"Mechanical Republic\\" standing outside in a field, buffeted by wind and rain. =Lost Treasure & Found Sound (2007-2008)= However, in 2006 Sleep Room were to lose their second bass player. Treasure disappeared off the radar while Cook, Weston and King were only to hear on the grapevine rumours that he had \\"hung up his bass\\" and run off to Australia. Distressed by the disappearance of their friend and colleague, Sleep Room continued to write and perform as a three piece, feeling replacing their troubled bassist was a tough task to face. Re-writing much of their catalogue to incorporate the bass-lines into Weston's and Cook's guitar pieces, Sleep Room's sound began to evolve this time through necessity rather than choice. Weston's usually free guitar was now slightly restrained by bass duties, and Cook's guitar sound was worked on to produce deeper and fuller tones. However, rather than hamper the sound, the band grew stronger for it. Weston was inspired to write razor-sharp and technical riffs as opposed to the liberated atmospherics of previous albums, and Cook managed to engineer a sound for his guitar that ended up more resembling a distorted string section in an orchestra than a guitar. Peculiarly, both Weston and Cook began to swap roles, Weston rooting the songs with rhythmic riffery while Cook provided overdubs of solo-esque instrumental sections and atmospherics. The band continued to exist as a three piece until late 2008, when they finally decided that while it worked without a bass, it would only be better with one. =Three Become Four Again (2008-2009)= Alex Bowen auditioned for the band and the band was instantly impressed, for he learned most of the catalogue in a very short period of time and applied his own unique style to the music. Bowen tightened up the newly written, previously bass-less tracks, and inspired several new songs with music of his own. Bowen made his live debut in The Three Bee's, Reading and the gig was a success. Following a number of gigs around Reading, Bowen and Sleep Room began to write their fourth studio album. Entering Earth Terminal for a third time, Lewis Childs and Sleep Room recorded and mixed the five song EP 'Gone' in three days. The album features a honed Sleep Room style; while the epic and progressive nature is retained, the songs have become more compact. Still experimental in structure, and unique in sound, Sleep Room have produced something which is accessible as well as thought provoking.

During the initial year of putting the band together and working on new material the band wrote and independently released the single, \\"Shock\\" in 1991 which rose to the top of the dance charts. Industrial dance music ruled the charts in Europe along with strong ties to Chicago, Wax Trax Records, and Houston. Subsequent releases of \\"Cut the Skin\\" and \\"Shoot to Kill\\" gained national exposure on the dance charts and club scene. \\"Never Again\\" was self-released as a radio single and quickly rose to the top of Houston Radio Station's 93Q and 96.5 attracting the attention of independent record label Alpha International. Stephen Bogle produced the single of \\"Never Again\\". The band wrote and produced the album \\"Leave Me Alone\\" but due to the bankruptcy of Alpha International the record sat idle. It was released but there were no marketing efforts behind it. After the release of the album, the band sought out drummer Max Schuldberg and they played their first concert as a foursome opening for Peter Murphy at Southern Star Amphitheater. They played concerts in Texas as a foursome for two years. Along with the three founders and newest member Max Schuldberg, the band added producer Stephen Bogle as guitarist to complete the line up. The band recorded and produced \\"Grip\\" under their own start up label, Gut Records. \\"Grip\\" went on to sell 15,000 units with the help of a crafty rework of Bad Company's \\"Feel like Makin Love\\". Universal Records, at the time a brand new start up label, heard of the success of \\"Grip\\" and signed the band as their second artist ever. \\"Devil Thumbs a Ride\\", the 3rd album, had already been recorded and mastered and was about to be manufactured for another self-release when Universal stepped in to sign the band and release the album as-is. The Hunger had a hit song in 1996, \\"Vanishing Cream\\", from the Devil Thumbs a Ride CD, which received heavy airplay on rock stations and reached No. 4 on the Mainstream Rock charts. After two years of constant touring, the band finally stopped to record their second release with Universal Records, \\"Cinematic Superthug\\". After only moderate success with the single, \\"Moderation\\", the band asked to be and was granted a release from their contract from Universal Records. Two songs, \\"Shoot to Kill\\", also from Devil Thumbs a Ride, and \\"If\\", from Grip, reached No. 42 on Billboard's Dance/Club Play chart. The band has released six albums: two on Universal Records and four on independent labels. Former original drummer (1991-2003) Max Schuldberg (voted 2002's Best Drummer by the Houston Press Music Awards) parted with the band after the five albums in 2003 and moved to Los Angeles. Former guitarist and two time Grammy Award nominee http://www.stephenboglemusic.com/index.php?page=remixes(remixer, for his work with D.J. Cubanito) Stephen Bogle now Produces artists in the Metal, Electronic, and Pop genres. In late 2005 Stephen Bogle parted ways with the band, and Tim Huston was quickly picked up. With having only a few practices with the band they headed on tour with Ten Years. Tim Huston stayed with the band from late '05 til 2013. \\"The lifestyle was just getting too overwhelming for me to handle. If I would have stayed, who knows what would have happened to me. There was just no off button\\". In 2013, guitarist Raf Rivera joined the lineup, and the band is currently in the process of recording their first new material in over 8 years.

It was last assigned to the 433d Troop Carrier Group, based at Rhein-Main Air Base, West Germany. It was inactivated on July 14, 1952. History=World War II= Established under I Troop Carrier Command, January 1943. after training deployed to Fifth Air Force in the Southwest Pacific Theater, August 1943 during the New Guinea Campaign. Engaged in combat operations, flying combat cargo resupply missions, troop carrier missions, parachute drops and other missions as necessary in New Guinea, Dutch East Indies; Philippine Campaign and the Battle of Okinawa. Participated in the Occupation of Japan, 1945-1946. =Reserve duty and Korean War mobilization= The squadron was again activated in the reserve in April 1947. In July it again became part of the 433d Troop Carrier Group. It is not clear to what extent the unit was equipped and manned before 27 June 1949, when Continental Air Command (ConAC) reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization system and the 433d Troop Carrier Wing replaced the 12th Air Division as the headquarters organization for reserve flying units at Cleveland. After this date the squadron was manned at 25% of normal strength.Cantwell, p. 74 The wing flew various trainer aircraft and Curtiss C-46 Commandos. The squadron, along with all reserve combat and corollary units, was mobilized for the Korean war.Cantwell, p. 87 It was part of the first wave to be mobilizedThe 452d Bombardment Wing and 437th Troop Carrier Wing were the only reserve units mobilized for the Korean War before the 433d Wing and its components. Cantwell, p. 87. Upon activation in October 1950, the squadron moved to Greenville Air Force Base (later Donaldson Air Force Base), South Carolina; receiving Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar aircraft the following month. The unit began tactical training in March 1951. It airlifted personnel and supplies to United States Army units in the field. It also airdropped personnel and equipment during army exercises. The 67th left Donaldson in July 1952 and arrived at Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany in early August. In Europe, it participated with U.S., British, and French units in field training. In July 1952, the squadron was inactivated and its mission, personnel and equipment were assumed by the 39th Troop Carrier Squadron, which was simultaneously activated at Rhein-Main.See Fletcher, p. 151 (showing activation and inactivation of 433d and 317th Wing units) =Reactivation in the reserve= The Air Force desired that all reserve units be designed to augment the regular forces in the event of a national emergency. In the early 1950s, there were six reserve pilot training wings that had no mobilization mission. These included the 8707th Pilot Training Wing at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas.Mueller, p. 55 On 18 May 1955, the 8707th and its components were discontinued and replaced by the reactivated 433d Troop Carrier Wing (including the 67th Troop Carrier Squadron), again flying Curtiss Commandos.Cantwell, p. 146 In the summer of 1956, the squadron participated in Operation Sixteen Ton during its two weeks of active duty training. Sixteen Ton was performed entirely by reserve troop carrier units and moved United States Coast Guard equipment From Floyd Bennett Naval Air Station to Isla Grande Airport in Puerto Rico and San Salvador in the Bahamas. After the success of this operation, the wing began to use inactive duty training periods for Operation Swift Lift, transporting high priority cargo for the air force and Operation Ready Swap, transporting aircraft engines, between Air Materiel Command‚Äôs depots.Cantwell, pp. 149-150 In 1960, the wing and squadron moved across town to Kelly Air Force Base. =Reassignment to troop carrier group= After May 1959, the reserve flying force consisted of 45 troop carrier squadrons assigned to 15 troop carrier wings.There were an additional four rescue squadrons not assigned to the wings. Cantwell, p. 156 The squadrons were not all located with their parent wings, but were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept. The concept offered several advantages. Communities were more likely to accept the smaller squadrons than the large wings and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning.Cantwell, pp. 156, 169 However, under this concept, all support organizations were located with the wing headquarters.Cantwell, p. 156 Although this was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. To resolve this, at the start of 1962, Continental Air Command, (ConAC) determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed.Cantwell, pp. 189‚Äì191 As a result, the 921st Troop Carrier Group was established at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas on 17 January 1963 as squadron's headquarters. Along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 67th. If mobilized, the group was gained by Tactical Air Command (TAC), which was also responsible for its training. In June 1974, the two reserve airlift groups at Kelly were reduced to a single unit. At the end of the month, the 922d Tactical Airlift Group was inactivated and its 68th Tactical Airlift Squuadron took over the remaining assets of the 67th as it transferred to the 921st Group.See Mueller, p. 284.

Honda sold the Dominator from the factory at $3,500 msrp. The engine was a slightly enlarged version of the tried and proven XR600R, around since 1985, with the 97 x 80mm bore enlarged to 100mm, stroked to 82mm, for a total of 644cc. This generated 44 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, with 53 lb-ft of torque at 5,000rpm. To smooth out vibrations created by the large single cylinder engine, a gear-driven counterbalancing system was installed. A single chain-driven overhead camshaft pushed down on the four valves, and the compression ratio was 8.3:1. Intake was via a 40mm Keihin constant-velocity carburetor, obtaining as much as 45 mpg from the 3.4 gallons in the tank. The Dominator had a dual exhaust that tucked alongside the rear fender. The powertrain was a wet clutch that powered a 5-speed gearbox. The bike featured a dry-sump engine in which the frame carries the oil supply. The non- adjustable fork had 41mm tubes and supplied 8.5 inches of travel; rake was 28.5 degrees, trail, 4.5 inches. A fork brace was built into the underside of the fender. Front wheel was a spoked 21-incher, carrying the standard 90/90 tire. And it had a single brake disc with twin-piston caliper. At the back, the single-shock setup allowed for preload alterations, with the rear wheel travel at 7.5 inches. The rear tire featured a drum brake. The foot pegs had rubber inserts, which appealed to the urban rider. If someone was interested in a more off-road situation, the inserts could be punched out, leaving saw- toothed metal pegs that are useful in slippery situations.The NX650 sold, but not in the numbers that Honda America had projected. The NX650 was off the US market after two short years, while the European version sold well all the way through 2003. In addition to the NX 650, there were also NX125, NX150, NX200, NX250, NX350, NX400 and NX500 variations.

Prior to making politics a full-time career, Schreiner operated businesses that were food-related. He has been a small business advocate, entrepreneur, and food policy expert. Schreiner joined the Green Party of Ontario in 2005 and became leader in 2009, taking over from Frank de Jong. He made history in the 2018 provincial election, becoming the first ever Green MPP, taking 45% of the vote in the riding of Guelph. His election marked the first time that four different parties were elected to the Ontario Legislature since 1951. It was Schreiner's second time running in Guelph, after running in Haliburton‚ÄîKawartha Lakes‚ÄîBrock and Simcoe‚ÄîGrey previously. Background Schreiner is a US-born Canadian. He was born on 9 June 1969, in WaKeeney, Kansas, the son of Barbara and Ronald Schreiner (1949‚Äì2007). He grew up on the family grain farm, helping his parents. This is where his interest in food, agriculture and the environment began. After graduating from Indiana University, Schreiner and his wife moved to Toronto in 1994, and he became a Canadian citizen in 2007. He and his wife Sandy are the parents of two daughters. Education Schreiner earned bachelor's degrees in business administration and history from the University of Kansas (1992). He earned his master's degree in history from Indiana University Bloomington in 1994. While at Indiana University, he met his future wife, Sandy Welsh, later a sociology professor and vice provost at the University of Toronto. Career Schreiner has been an entrepreneur and small business owner whose ventures have focused on sustainable food production and the local food movement. His first business was Toronto Organics that specialized in delivering food to consumers. After moving to the Guelph area, Schreiner continued operating food distribution businesses. One company ‚Äì WOW Foods ‚Äì was awarded the Citizens Bank of Canada Ethics in Action Award for socially responsible business and the Toronto Food Policy Council's Local Food Hero Award. He also co-founded Earthdance Organics, a Guelph-based food production business that supplied area health food stores and farmers' markets in the early 2000s. In 2005 Schreiner he co-founded Local Food Plus, which brought \\"farmers and consumers together to promote financially, socially and environmentally sustainable local food systems\\". According to the Green Party of Ontario, he has served as a volunteer with organizations including FarmStart, the Brewer's Plate, the Toronto Food Policy Council and the Green Enterprise Ontario Steering Committee, the Canadian International Peace Project, and Toronto's Campus Community Co-op Day Care Centre. Political career Schreiner has been actively involved in the GPO since 2004. He co- chaired the 2007 election platform committee and served as policy coordinator from 2008 to 2009. He was acclaimed as party leader in 2009. Schreiner first ran as a candidate for the GPO in the Haliburton‚ÄîKawartha Lakes‚ÄîBrock by- election in March 2009, losing to Rick Johnson. In the 2011 election, Schreiner ran as a candidate for Simcoe‚ÄîGrey, finishing fourth behind Progressive Conservative incumbent Jim Wilson. Schreiner was nominated as the party's candidate for Guelph in the 2014 Ontario general election, where he finished third behind winner Liz Sandals of the Ontario Liberal Party, garnering over 19% of the vote. In May 2018, the Toronto Star editorial board endorsed him as the best candidate in Guelph and said that he was \\"the most forthright leader in the campaign for the 7 June Ontario election\\". He was also endorsed by the Guelph Mercury's editorial board in an op-ed, \\"Mike Schreiner is the candidate most worthy of representing Guelph provincially\\", citing ten reasons to vote for Schreiner. Schreiner's campaign proved successful in a four-party race, becoming the first ever Green MPP in Ontario history. He captured 45 per cent of the vote in the Guelph riding, more than doubling the previous percentage and nearly tripling the actual number of voters for him.  Leadership of the Green Party of Ontario  On 14 November 2009, Schreiner won the Ontario Green Party leadership election, having been acclaimed. According to the GPO, \\"Under Mike‚Äôs leadership the GPO has experienced substantial growth in its voters, fundraising, staff, volunteers and media exposure\\". Between 2009 and 2014 for example, fundraising increased from $50,000 to $500,000, all from individuals. Those achievements did not translate into success in terms of getting a seat until 2018. Despite not holding a seat in the legislature at that time, Schreiner lobbied in favour of the price on carbon, protecting pollinators with a ban on neonicotinoids, and funding for the Experimental Lakes Area. =2018 Election= Schreiner's platform for the Green Party of Ontario included the following, as summarized by the Toronto Star. *Implement more programs to help homeowners with green retrofits to save energy *Offer universal dental care and pharmacare *Set a date to phase out internal combustion engines to reduce greenhouse gas emissions *Introduce carbon pricing to discourage use of greenhouse gas- producing goods and services, with revenues returned to Ontarians as dividends *Focus health system more on illness prevention Schreiner expanded on the platform with this comment: \\"I am fighting for a livable future for my children, I am fighting to tackle climate change and address income inequality, social justice issues and improving our democracy\\". During an interview in May 2018 he added that the Party proposed cutting payroll taxes for some small businesses to be made up for with an increased tax rate on larger businesses. Just prior to the election, he told the CBC that he hopes to see Ontario moving to 100 per cent renewable energy and was in favour of closing the nuclear power plant at Pickering. He also favoured adding mental health coverage into the Ontario Health Insurance Plan and a basic income program. Despite efforts to convince them otherwise, Schreiner was excluded from televised leaders debates, a move the Toronto Star billed as \\"unfair\\". The publication's Ontario Politics Commentator made this comment: \\"This isn't the first time they have conspired to exclude the Greens, but this time the exclusion is more egregious than ever\\". Following his win in the 2018 election, Schreiner was sworn into the Ontario Legislature on 5 July. Although he had been viewed by many as primarily a \\"green\\" candidate Schreiner said that his goal would be broader. \\"I'm going to do politics differently. I campaigned on a promise to create jobs, put people and planet first. I‚Äôm going to keep fighting for that.\\" =42nd Parliament= During the first three months of the 42nd Parliament, he was a frequent critic of Premier Doug Ford. As a party leader, Schreiner has been extensively quoted by the news media on issues such as the government's decisions to cancel the province's cap-and- trade legislation, scrapping the green energy programs and rebates, on the tactics used by Ford to reduce the size of Toronto Council and on the provincial plan to allow marijuana smoking in numerous locations. Personal life Schreiner lives with his wife Sandy and their two daughters in Toronto and in Guelph. He became a Canadian citizen in 2007. During 2012 to 2017, he was a contributor to HuffPost Canada, on topics such as water protection, healthy food systems, recycling, climate change, clean tech, transit, energy and carbon pricing. Schreiner served on the steering committee for Green Enterprise Toronto, an association of over 350 small businesses, and on the Board of Directors of FarmStart, a non-profit that assists new farmers in Ontario, and he is a governor of the Canadian International Peace Project. He is a Rotarian and volunteer on many Guelph initiatives including Hillside Music Festival, Guelph Jazz Festival, Guelph Community Clean up, Guelph Coalition for Active Transportation, and Democracy Guelph.

Numan The Batavian Revolution in Amsterdam refers to the transfer of power in the city of Amsterdam on 18 January 1795 to a Revolutionary Committee of the new Batavian Republic. The same day the stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, William V, Prince of Orange fled the country. Amsterdam was the first city that declared itself in the Batavian Revolution that brought about the Batavian Republic. Background Amsterdam had been a hotbed of Patriot revolutionary fervor during the Patriot Revolution of 1785‚Äì1787. After the Prussian intervention of 1787 and the subsequent Orangist repression, the city reverted to control by the ancien regime of the stadtholder. The Dutch Republic became an Anglo-Prussian client state whose foreign policy was determined in London and Berlin, while the exiled Patriots plotted its overthrow in France. When the revolutionary French Republic declared war on the powers of the First Coalition in 1792, the exiles strongly favored the inclusion of the Dutch Republic. During the early Flanders Campaign, the exiles formed their own \\"Batavian Legion\\" that (like its Belgian equivalent) fought side by side with the armies of general Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez under command of general Herman Willem Daendels. However, despite an incursion into North Brabant (then part of the non-selfgoverning Generality Lands), the attack on the Dutch Republic was unsuccessful in 1793 after the French defeat at Neerwinden.Schama, pp. 116, 131‚Äì135, 138‚Äì160. Dumouriez defected to Austria. In 1794, the campaign was more successful for the French and their Batavian allies. North Brabant was again invaded by the French army under general Charles Pichegru and occupied up to the river Waal. This proved as yet too much of an obstacle for the French. Nevertheless, the French success had emboldened the Patriot partisans that had remained in Amsterdam. Despite the vigilance of the political police of the stadtholder, they had been able to form secret societies, masquerading as \\"reading clubs\\" that spread revolutionary propaganda, and prepared for insurrection by secretly amassing arms in an arsenal on the Roeterseiland. Ringleaders were Alexander Gogel and Cornelis Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff, the latter acting as Military Officer of the Amsterdam Revolutionary Committee.Schama, 172‚Äì175. On 14 October 1794, the stadtholder (aware that something was afoot) ordered the city council of Amsterdam to take measures to ensure that civil order would be preserved. The garrison under General Golowkin was reinforced with 4,000 British troops from the British army of occupation. That same day, however, the Patriot insurrection began. The Patriots presented a petition to the city regents, protesting the billeting of the British troops, and this was supposed to be the signal for the revolt. This did not materialize, due to the intimidation by the garrison troops, that occupied strategic points with cannon and barricades. The petition had inadvertently provided the political police with the names and addresses of the would-be revolutionaries and these were rounded up following 17 October. Gogel and Krayenhoff fled the city; the latter joined the central Patriot Revolutionary Committee at the French headquarters in 's-Hertogenbosch.Schama, pp. 175‚Äì178. The takeover of the city government During the Winter of 1794 French troops had been on the Waal river, poised to advance. Only when the river froze over, in the severe weather that started mid December, were they able to go forward. They advanced very rapidly due to the collapse of the defensive forces of the stadtholder and his British, Prussian and Austrian allies. A number of important cities fell in rapid succession.Schama, pp. 186‚Äì187 On 16 January 1795 general Joseph Souham accepted the surrender of the city of Utrecht after Prussian troops under general Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn had evacuated the province of the same name, and the British occupation troops had left the city \\"taking with them virtually anything that could be moved.\\"As Schama puts it; the British had earlier pillaged Nijmegen before their departure;Schama, pp. 187‚Äì188 The Batavian Revolutionary Committee followed these developments with mixed feelings. Well aware of the French predilection for annexation (as their Belgian neighbors had experienced the previous year) they deemed it necessary that a big Dutch city should be taken by Dutch efforts next, so as to demonstrate that the pretensions of the committee to exercise independent authority could be validated. Amsterdam was the obvious choice. The news of the fall of Utrecht galvanized the remnants of the Amsterdam Revolutionary Committee into action on 17 January. Posters and handbills appeared on every street corner and rumors started to fly that the revolutionaries would seize power the next day.Schama, p. 189 That next day, Sunday 18 January, the Revolutionary Committee met secretly in their haunt, a tavern by the name of Het Wapen van Embden (\\"the Emden Arms\\") on the Nieuwendijk street, near city hall. A substantial crowd gathered and a deputation, led by Gogel, was sent at the head of this crowd to city hall to demand arms \\"so as to be able to maintain public order.\\" As in October of the previous year, burgomaster Straalman refused to be intimidated, and ordered out the garrison. However, differently than in October, general Golowkin now hesitated as he was reluctant to shed blood with the French so nearby. His mind was made up when that same evening Krayenhoff arrived in a French lieutenant's uniform, bearing a commission from the central Revolutionary Committee in Utrecht to remove the \\"illegal\\" Orangist city government.Schama, pp. 189‚Äì190 Golowkin unexpectedly went along with this charade and in effect surrendered the city to Krayenhoff then and there. Krayenhoff next proceeded to city hall at the head of an enormous crowd and demanded the surrender of the city from Straalman. The latter tried to stall, but the crowd became threatening and fearing for his personal safety Straalman transferred command of the garrison to Krayenhoff at midnight. Amsterdam had \\"fallen\\" to an unarmed Dutch revolutionary.Schama, p. 190 The next morning, 19 January, the Amsterdam Revolutionary Committee, with Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck as its president, rode in a triumphant procession of carriages to city hall, where they proceeded to read a proclamation declaring that the incumbent city councillors had forfeited their offices. It also promised democratic elections of a new city government (the first in the history of the city as previously it had always been governed by an oligarchy) in the near future. Meanwhile, a provisional government of 22 members was put in charge of the city. This provisional government had as its first order of business the welcome of the French (who had delayed their advance from Utrecht in happy expectation of the outcome). The first French chasseurs arrived that afternoon to general acclaim. The population had meanwhile erected a liberty tree in Dam Square.Schama, pp. 190‚Äì191 Aftermath The previous night, around midnight of 18 January, stadtholder William V followed his wife Wilhelmina, who had left the previous morning, into exile, boarding a fishing vessel at the Scheveningen beach.Schama, p.191 Much of the Pro-British faction of the city of Amsterdam fled along with the Prince of Orange, so there was very little opposition to the change of power. The British armies made no effort to retake Amsterdam, instead they continued retreating towards Bremen ‚Äì from which they were eventually evacuated in March 1795.Harvey pp. 139‚Äì40 The model of the transfer of power in Amsterdam was soon followed in other Dutch cities not yet occupied by the French. Revolutionary committees sprang up left and right, demanding surrender of the ruling city councils to new provisional administrations and the disarmament of the Orangist civic militias and their replacement with \\"Free Corps\\" companies from the days of the 1785‚Äì1787 Patriot Revolt. In this way Schiedam, Haarlem and Leeuwarden, to mention a few, experienced peaceful revolutions of their own. Only the Orangist stronghold of The Hague held out; its Orangist city government sought its own accommodation with the French and it was only replaced on 26 February.Schama, pp. 192‚Äì193 The Amsterdam Revolutionary Committee took the initiative to convene a constituent assembly of representatives of the cities that constituted the constituencies of the States of Holland and West Friesland on 24 January. This resulted two days later in the abolition of those States and their replacement with the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland.Schama, pp. 190‚Äì191, 212 ReferencesSources * Harvey, Robert.

Jonah Fisher is an experienced BBC correspondent and during an eventful 10 years working for the BBC has been based in Eritrea, Sudan, London, South Africa, Nigeria and most recently, Thailand. He has worked on many features for the BBC including: interviewing Buddhist monk Wirathu and members of Burma's Muslim community who have been caught up in clashes with Buddhist nationalists in 2013, accompanying Greenpeace tracking whales hunted by the Japanese whaling fleet; and violence against journalists by Sudanese security forces outside Khartoum, Sudan where he was attacked. From 2012 to 2014, Fisher was the BBC's correspondent in Bangkok where he covered anti-government protesters in Bangkok as demonstrators try to unseat the Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Myanmar Resident Correspondent Jonah Fisher is the first resident correspondent for the BBC in Myanmar.

Bloomberg - Bond Vigilantes Confront Obama as Housing Falters In the bond market, prices move inversely to yields. When investors perceive that inflation risk or credit risk is rising they demand higher yields to compensate for the added risk. As a result, bond prices fall and yields rise, which increases the net cost of borrowing. The term references the ability of the bond market to serve as a restraint on the government's ability to over- spend and over-borrow. United States=Clinton administration= From October 1993 to November 1994 US 10-year yields climbed from 5.2% to just over 8.0% fueled by concerns about federal spending in what became informally known as the \\"Great Bond Massacre.\\" With some guidance from Robert Rubin, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, the Clinton administration and Congress made an effort to reduce the deficit, and 10-year yields dropped to approximately 4% by November 1998. Clinton political adviser James Carville said at the time, \\"I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.\\" =Obama administration= During the Obama administration some suggest that bond vigilantes were making a return with worries over sustainability and budgetary responsibility. Mark MacQueen, a partner and money manager at Sage Advisory Services Ltd., based in Austin, Texas, said, \\"The vigilante group is different this time around. It‚Äôs major foreign creditors. This whole idea that we need to spend our way out of our problems is being questioned.\\" However, economist Paul Krugman and other New Keynesians pointed out that there was no evidence for bond vigilante activity by pointing out the fact that 10-year yields remained quite low.https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/invisible- bond-vigilantes/ Eurozone During the eurozone crisis that started in 2009, bond vigilantes were blamed for pushing up the government borrowing in the PIIGS countries.

It is known for its coarseness and health benefits. It is popular in Kerala and coastal Karnataka in India and Sri Lanka where it is used on a regular basis for idlies, appams and plain rice; it is different from brown rice. The robust and earthy flavour of Red Matta makes it suitable to accompany lamb, beef or game meats. Origin Palakkadan matta rice was the choice of the royal families of Chola and Chera dynasties of India. The poorer sections of the society had no access to it as this variety was considered very expensive at that time. Kerala matta rice has been historically popular due to its rich and unique taste. It is used in preparations of rice-snacks like Kondattam, Murukku etc. References to chunnila matta can be found in the work Rice in Kerala authored by Sri. P.C. Sahadevan and published by the Government of Kerala in 1966. The rice is mentioned in Tamil classics such as Thirukkural. Rice in the days of the Chera/Chola kingdoms was considered a royal food. The working classes more commonly ate chama (an inferior variety of cereal). Cultivation and trade Kerala matta rice is grown in Kerala and Karnataka in southern India. Matta rice gives Kerala farmers a premium of Rs. 300 for 500 kg of paddy. A three- year ban on the export of matta rice was partially lifted in February 2011, allowing 25,000 tonnes to be exported in 2011. Palakkadan matta rice is cultivated in the dense black cotton soil of Palakkad district in Kerala. The rice has a distinct earthly flavour because of the type of soil in which it is cultivated. These paddy fields are called 'poonthalpadam' and the soil contains a lot of clay and silt. Because of these qualities, this kind of paddy fields can retain more water. Characteristics The grains are yellowish pink (from being parboiled) with reddish outer layers. Rose matta rice maintains its pink hue as well as its flavour on cooking. Like all brown or parboiled rice, red matta has a lengthy cooking time and requires extra water. Kerala matta rice/Palakkadan matta rice =Uniqueness= Palakkadan matta rice is registered under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999 by the Palakkad Matta Farmers Producer Company Ltd. It is a coarse variety of rice with bold grains and red pericarp. The rice has a unique taste. The coarse rice with red pericarp by itself ensures high content of nutrients. Par-boiling of the rice further ensures retention of nutritional value. The grains are grown on unique black cotton or regar soil, derived from rocks rich in lime peculiar to Palakkad, also in Poonthalpadam where the soil is heavy, containing 60‚Äì80% of clay and silt and possess low permeability and high water holding capacity. These soils, the humid weather of Palakkad, easterly winds that blow through the Palakkad gap and the rivers that flow from the Western Ghats. =Preparation= Parboiled rice is harder than white rice and needs some thirty minutes of soaking before cooking. Matta rice is traditionally double cooked. The rice is washed in a large pan and left to soak from 1 hour to overnight. The rice is drained and simmered with 4 to 8 parts water for 30 minutes. It is then covered and left for 15‚Äì20 minutes. The rice is then salted and boiled for another 15‚Äì20 minutes or until cooked. It is finally drained and left covered for a further 10‚Äì15 minutes before serving. Quality Paddy is thoroughly cleaned and destoned prior to boiling and drying process. Final finished rice is graded for removing brokens and again colour sorted in computerised sorting machines and well packed. Nutrition benefits Palakkadan Matta rice is more nutritious than white polished rice because parboiling before milling retains some nutrients. One serving cup of 1/4 size can contain 160 calories and 1 gram of fibre. White rice doesn't contain any fibre. The brown outer layer of the Matta rice contains many nutrients and white rice is made by polishing away this valuable layer. One cup of Matta rice can contain 84 milligrams of magnesium and one gram of calcium. It also contains vitamins.  E-commerce application by farmers  Some farms have adopted technology to ship matta rice from the farm to customers.  Personalisation  An agrarian family in Palakkad introduced a smartphone application to order personalised matta rice. The application allows customers to choose the bran content of the rice that they order. Adulteration A serious health hazard is the wide availability of artificially colored matta rice. The color added for this purpose can be harmful to the body. There are complaints that such varieties are widely distributed through the subsidized public distribution systems on which the poor depend heavily.

Fermanagh"},{"id":"21326322","text":"Deadman (stylized as deadman) is a Japanese rock band founded in Nagoya in 2000. The group gained notoriety for popularizing the nagoya kei subgenre of visual kei, which is a lot \\"darker\\" than most and focuses more on musical composition. Deadman also quickly became known for vocalist Mako's heavily melancholic lyrical themes, with the music itself touching on alternative rock in sound. The group disbanded in 2006 for unknown reasons. Mako and guitarist aie reunited as Deadman in 2019. History Guitarist and leader aie, vocalist and bassist Yukino were all previously in the band Kein. In 2000 they formed Deadman with drummer Toki, whom aie previously played with in Lamiel. They played their first concert on January 6, 2001. Shortly after the release of their first single, \\"Subliminal Effect\\", Yukino left the group and was replaced by Takamasa previously of Lady. Yukino went on to the bands Gullet and lynch..

After 13 years, Mako and aie announced a reunion as Deadman in March 2019. After a performance on June 22 at Nagoya Bottom Line, where aie revealed that the reunion would last until September 2020, they played a one- man live at Ebisu Liquidroom on September 9, 2019. The duo were supported both times by Tetsu (Merry) on bass and Asanao (lynch.) on drums. After two more performances in October and November, Deadman went on a three-date tour throughout December. In February 2020, the duo embarked on a joint tour with Gibkiy Gibkiy Gibkiy. Another joint tour, this time with Cali Gari, was set to take place in March. However, those dates have been postponed until May and June due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Musical style Deadman cites Buck-Tick, Chage and Aska and Kurt Cobain as inspiring them. Their music incorporates several different genres of rock, drawing heavily from alternative rock and indie rock. A style reminiscent of gothic rock, punk and post-punk can also be seen, in what is much of Deadman's musical sporadic-ism. Often incorporated into individual songs are several \\"movements\\" that seem to drift back and forth, with erratic vocals and sounds. =Lyrical themes= Mako's lyrics usually touch on the \\"psychological instability of mankind, the mortality of humans, and religion\\", particularly Christianity and Shintoism references are made often. The title of their album 701125 is a reference to the date author Yukio Mishima died, November 25, 1970.
