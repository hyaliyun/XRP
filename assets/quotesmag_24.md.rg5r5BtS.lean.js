His father was originally a farmer but moved to Brussels in 1852 to become a painting restorer as he had an interest and some practice in art. Frans and his older brother Cornelius were encouraged by their father to practise art.Lucien Solvay, 'Frans Van Leemputten' at the Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 26, p. 446-447 In 1855 the family briefly moved to Antwerp where the young Frans attended classes at the Antwerp Academy. In 1858 the family moved back to Brussels where Frans worked mainly in his father's restoration shop.'Bij Ensor Op Bezoek', Pandora Publishers, 2010, p. 267 Distribution of bread in the village Van Leemputten took evening classes at the Academy of Fine Arts of Brussels from 1865 to 1873. Here he was a student of Paul Lauters. Lauters encouraged Van Leemputten to paint from nature rather than to copy old compositions. Under the influence of Constantin Meunier and the Dutch landscape painter Paul Gabriël who was then living in Brussels and the reading of Hendrik Conscience's novels which extolled the virtues of the peasants of the Campine, Van Leemputten started to devote himself almost exclusively to the depiction of that region and its inhabitants. Frans became a member of the drawing club 'La Patte de Dindon'. In 1872 Van Leemputten made his debut at the salon of La Chrysalide, the group to which also James Ensor, Louis Artan and Guillaume Vogels belonged. He also joined 'L'Essor', a group which mainly promoted realism and assisted its members financially and with the organization of exhibitions and the purchase of materials. Through his membership of these two groups Van Leemputten was closely linked to some of the most progressive Belgian artists of his day. From 1874 he submitted works to the Antwerp salon. Van Leemputten was in 1892 appointed professor of the painting of animals at the Higher Institute of Fine Arts of the Antwerp Academy. He replaced Charles Verlat in that position. Van Leemputten's pupils included Frans Mortelmans, Frans Slager, Jan Van Puyenbroeck, Achille Van Sassenbrouck and Hendrik Jan Wolter.Frans MORTELMANS (Antwerpen 1865 - Antwerpen 1936) at Berko Fine Paintings Work Candle procession in Scherpenheuvel Frans Van Leemputten painted realist landscapes with figures, village scenes and animal scenes. He initially employed a dull palette but gradually started using brighter tones. Van Leemputten worked in oils as well as in watercolors. His work was influenced by the realism of Jean-François Millet. Van Leemputten was part of a group of Belgian painters who took refuge from the complexity of urban life to look for simplicity, purity and naturalness in the pre-industrial countryside. They saw the countryside as a serene world, which stood in sharp contrast to their familiar urban environment. In the countryside they searched for quiet and contemplation and identified themselves with the simple villagers. They had a particular fondness for the Campine region, which was relatively isolated and had been untouched by industrialization. Some of these artists, such as Theodoor Verstraete and Van Leemputten who both worked in the Campine, depicted the rural reality from their own urban background and viewpoint. Theodoor Verstraete was driven by his social consciousness and compassion with the villagers. Van Leemputten, on the other hand, concentrated on sharp observations of the daily life of the peasants, their customs and key life events. In his works he emphasized the dignity of the poor farmers, their mutual connectedness and profound devoutness. This is shown in works such as Distribution of bread in the village (1892, M - Museum Leuven). His compositions are characterized by a clear palette and are executed with photographic precision. Van Leemputten often represented the Campine residents as monumental, immobile figures. Some of his works were thus transformed into still images of the serene country life.Lut Pil, 'Boeren, burgers en buitenlui: voorstellingen van het landelijk leven in België vanaf 1850', Leuven University Press, 1 Jan 1990, p. 27-29 Thanks to their precise and objective observation, his works have documentary value.Jasmina van Kersschaever, 'Kunstcollectie: provincie Antwerpen', Antwerp Province, Departement Cultuur, Dienst Cultuurspreiding en Kunsten, 2006 References Going to church External links Belgian genre painters Belgian history painters Belgian landscape painters 19th-century Belgian painters 1850 births 1914 deaths ","title":"Frans Van Leemputten"},{"id":"48558632","text":"Bertie Joseph Tuckwell (6 October 1882 - 2 January 1943) was an Australian- born cricketer who played first-class cricket in Australia and New Zealand.

He was an allrounder who batted left-handed and bowled left armed slow-medium, able to have the ball break both ways. He was a prominent club cricketer in Victoria, also representing the state in first-class cricket, and later moved to Western Australia where he also played both club and state cricket and became the leading all-rounder in the state. After retiring he coached at public schools, served on the W.A.C.A. executive and as a W.A. selector, and wrote for a newspaper. Cricket career He began his cricket career in 1896 playing for East Melbourne Cricket Club, initially playing for their Second XI side but making the First XI by 1897. He played seven first- class cricket matches for Victoria between 1904 and 1906, with a highlight of his career for the state being a score of 98 made in 80 minutes against New South Wales. He left Victoria to move to Western Australia in May 1906 as he had secured a position on the goldfields in his career as an assayist and metallurgist. Arthur Christian (front right) with fellow Vic cricketers, 1906. As of September 1906 Christian was training for cricket in Western Australia for the Kamballie Club, and he represented them in the Potts Shield in October. By December he was playing for Burbanks. In 1907 he represented Western Australia against New South Wales, and the opposition captain described him as the best of the West Australian bowlers praising his length and variation of pace. In October Christian played in a three day cricket match between a team representing the goldfields and one representing the coastal districts. Later in October 1907, Arthur was the only goldfields cricketer selected to represent West Australia in a tour game against the Marylebone Cricket Club which was part of the 1907-08 Ashes tour. He took five wickets and batted at five in the first innings scoring 3 and opened in the second innings scoring 15. West Australia losing by an innings.Scorecard of Tour Game at Cricket Archive English captain Arthur Jones praised his bowling, expressing that he was likely to improve, and also noted he thought him a capable batsman. In November 1907 Christian moved from the rural goldfields to Perth as he had secured a job with a leading sporting firm, Alcock & Co., and he also joined the Corinthian cricket club, and played his first match for them against Subiaco on 16 November in which he took 5 for 73. In March 1908 Christian was selected to represent Western Australia against the M.C.C. again in the last match of the 1907-08 Ashes tour, and one report called for him to be made captain. He did not captain but did take 3 wickets for 130 runs which included bowling Jack Hobbs, who dragged the ball onto his stumps, in the M.C.C.s only innings with the match ending in a draw.WA v MCC, March 13-16, 1908, Scorecard at CricketArchive By the end of his first club season for Corinthians in 1908 Arthur had topped both the batting and bowling averages, averaging 36.77 with the bat and 11.46 with the ball. He was also named honorary coach of junior players for the club at the Corinthians annual meeting in August 1908. In September 1908 Christian left Alcock & Co. and opened his own sports store called the Perth Sports Depot, with advertising for the new store emphasizing his role in selecting the stock and his reputation as a cricketer. Early advertising targeted cricket clubs as potential clients, and he offered one of the stores bats as a trophy for a local cricket competition. As of October 1908 Arthur had been appointed as Captain of Corinthians for the upcoming club season. Christian had a strong season in club cricket in 1908-09. In the second match of the season, played against Subiaco, he took 3 for 21, 4 for 33, and scored 143 in Corinthians only innings batting. In the third match against West Perth he took 8 for 20 and 4 for 31, also taking a hattrick, and scored 61. In a match against Fremantle Christian criticized the opposition for unsportsmanlike behavior due to an incident where the North Fremantle wicket keeper was hit in the body by the ball and hurt, and Christian's batting partner was run out after leaving his crease to check the keepers well-being. By February 1909 Corinthians was leading the competition and a report credited their success to Christian's allround abilities. By March he had taken 100 wickets at an average of 7.1 in the club season. Corinthians were ultimately premiers of the 1908-09 club cricket season. In April 1909 Christian was selected to captain West Australia against South Australia. In the first interstate game he won the toss and took 5 for 67 in one innings, but the match was drawn. In total South Australia played three games against the West and Christian took 25 out of WA's 46 wickets at an average of 17 in the series. All three games in the series were drawn. One series report noted Christian's performances as an all-rounder were the most notable events in each game. Some of the South Australian players said they thought Christian would have been selected for the 1909 Ashes had he still been playing in Victoria. In 1909 some comments from Christian were published in a Victorian newspaper in which he expressed the opinion that Western Australian wickets were not as good as those in the eastern states and that there were too many clubs competing in WA club cricket, although he positively noted that there were plans to divide the club competition into two grades for the 1909-10 season. The interview was reprinted in a Western Australian newspaper with the headline \\"Western Australian cricket criticised by Arthur Christian\\". By November 1909 he was being referred to as about the best all-round cricketer in West Australia. Christian was re-elected as captain of Corinthians for the 1909-10 club cricket season. In the fourth round he scored 135 not out against South Fremantle, although he was dropped three times. In the same match he also took 8 for 26. In the first match after the Christmas break in the season he took 7 for 26 against Henley Park. By February 1910 he had taken over 60 wickets at an average close to 8 in the season, but after his century his batting had been poor. By the end of the season he had taken 68 wickets at an average of 8.89 and also topped the batting averages for Corinthians, making it the third straight season he had topped both batting and bowling averages for the club. Corinthians merged with the East Perth football club at the end of the 1910 season and played under the name East Perth from the next season. In March 1910 Christian was selected as captain of West Australia for a series of games against Victoria. In November 1910 Christian provided a plan for improving the standard of Western Australian cricket to a local paper. Due to the remoteness of the state he argued that interstate matches could not be frequent, and that instead intrastate matches between sides representing the metropolitan, goldfield, and south-west regions of the state should be regularly played. He also again expressed that there were too many clubs competing in club cricket and stated that they should be separated into different grades. Also in November it was rumored that Christian may be selected to represent Australia against South Africa in the home series, and a newspaper report ranked him as among the top six all-rounders in the country. In December he was serving on the selection committee for a coastal team which was to play a goldfields team but he had to resign due to business commitments before the game. In January 1911 Christian captained East Perth in a novelty match against the Eumarella women's cricket team, where the men had to bat, bowl, and field with their wrong hand and every misfield resulted in two runs being awarded to Eumarella. In the early 1911 grade season the competition was split into two grades, and Christian had the best bowling average in the A grade competition season at 8.16, the most wickets with 92, and also scored 600 runs at an average of 33.05 in addition to captaining East Perth A team to the premiership. In October 1911 he changed teams, moving to North Perth, due to a new district system being introduced to revitalize grade cricket with him falling in the North Perth division. He scored a 122 in 35 minutes and took 6 for 11 in a match for North Perth in the opening game of the season in October 1911. Statistics In his state career Christian played 24 first-class matches. He scored 960 runs at an average of 22.85 with 6 fifties and took 15 catches, and took 102 wickets at an average of 24.43 with 6 five wicket hauls and 2 ten wicket hauls. Of these 793 runs and 82 wickets were scored/taken for Western Australia. In his Victorian club career he scored 2509 runs at an average of 30 with a high score of 145 not out, and took 255 wickets at an average of 13.8. In his Western Australian club career he scored 6655 runs at an average of 38.3 and took 995 wickets at an average of 8.6, taking over 100 wickets in a season twice.

There are two front 5 megapixel cameras for widescreen “groupies” (group portraits). Although the LG V10 features the same camera hardware as the LG G4, the camera software is more sophisticated and richer in functionality that includes RAW photography and manual camera parameter settings (exposure, ISO, exposure value, manual focus) for both photos and videos. An additional feature called “rear curtain sync” allows firing the camera flash at the end of the exposure time instead of the beginning, which supposedly prevents the overexposure of closer subjects.Sample images with “rear curtain sync” in GSMArena review (Page 9) In manual video mode, the LG V10 allows setting the framerate to levels between 1 and 120 frames per second, of which the highest available framerate depends on the selected resolution (e.g. 1080p at 60fps, 720p at 120fps). The bitrate can be set to the three levels of “high”, “medium” and “low” relative to the selected resolution and framerate combination. The LED torch that can be used to illuminate video recordings can be toggled during video recording. A wireless bluetooth microphone can be used for recording the sound of a video. GSMArena review of the LG V10 camera features (Page 8)PhoneArena review of the LG V10 camera (Page 2)Review of the LG V10 by TomsGuide  Reception  CNET gave the LG V10 a 4 out of 5, praising its incorporation of premium features such as a fingerprint reader and wide-angle front-facing camera options, as well as LG's continued inclusion of a removable battery and expandable storage. It was noted that many of its premium features (such as the dual- front cameras and extra message display) felt more like they were \\"nice to have\\" rather than must-have features, concluding that \\"If the V10's goodies aren't essential for you — meaning you don't need a wider view for your selfies or another screen to access your favorite apps and contacts -- it's best to go with something cheaper.\\" Android Authority concluded that the V10 was a more powerful device than the LG G4 due to its additional features and upgrades, stating that \\"if the G4 fell short of your expectations and you were looking for more, a lot more is what you are getting with the LG V10.\\" The V10 was found to be susceptible to hardware failure nearly identical to that of the G4, as both devices suffered from a manufacturing defect that eventually caused instability, and the devices to enter an unrecoverable reboot loop and thus, inoperable.

Prior history Military retirement pay has been characterized as both property and as reduced pay for reduced services, and therefore has been a relevant issue in divorce actions for military retirees.See also: U.S. v. Tyler, 105 U.S. 244, (1881), Lemly v. U.S., 109 Ct. Cl. 760 (1948), and Costello v. U.S., 587 F.2d 424 at 426 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929 (1979). Before the enactment of the USFSPA, former spouses had no statutory right to receive a portion of a member's military retired pay such as they would under later revisions of ERISA;ERISA provides the legal framework for qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs) with respect to civilian pension and retirement plans subject to ERISA's provisions. See 26 U.S. Code §414(p). for example, in the 1981 McCarty case, the U.S. Supreme Court determined there was total preemption of any such right concerning federal military retirement benefits. The interval between the McCarty decision and the enactment of the USFSPA is known by some courts as the \\"McCarty period\\" or the \\"McCarty interval.\\"In the Matter of the Marriage of Flannagan, 709 P. 2d 1247, 42 Wash. App. 214, WA Ct. App., 2nd Div (1985). Accessed 2015-11-15. Enactment effect The USFSPA was enacted in response to the McCarty decision, overturning it, and in the USFSPA the Congress authorized State courts to distribute, with certain limitations, disposable retired pay in a divorce proceeding.USFSPA, 10 U.S. Code §1408 [a][2][C]; [a][4]. The USFSPA specifically allows State courts to treat military retired pay either as the marital property of both the member and spouse (the marital community in community property States) and to allocate it accordingly, or as the property solely of the member, depending upon all the facts and circumstances.S. Rept. No. 97-502, at 1 (1982), 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1596, 1596. Post-enactment application Subsequent to the enactment of the USFSPA, State courts grappled with issues raised by its application in marital dissolution proceedings, such as whether the USFSPA may be applied retroactively to divorce decrees that were final and were not appealed after the Supreme Court decision in McCarty and before enactment of the USFSPA, i.e., during the McCarty interval. The DoDFM regulations implement the USFSPA, and the purpose of the 2009 DoDFM Regulation 7000.14-RDoDFM Regulation 7000.14-R volume 7B, ch. 29, para. 2901, February 2009, (DoDFM regulation, para. 2901). is to explain to former spouses how to apply for payments from military retired pay.Schuller v.

In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed rights under the USFSPA in the Mansell case and further limited the authority of State courts to assign spousal rights to military retirement pay. In Mansell, the court ruled that the USFSPA does not grant State courts the power to treat, as property divisible upon divorce, military retirement pay which has been waived in order to receive VA disability benefits. In other words, a State court is prohibited from distributing in a divorce action disposable retired pay which constitutes that portion of retired pay that has been waived by the retiree under 38 USC § 5305 in favor of receiving VA disability benefits.Dachille v.

Tax treatment The federal Tax Court has noted that there is no law which excludes military retired pay from income, and ruled in 2012 that the purpose of the USFSPA is not to address the tax treatment of military benefits, but rather to permit Federal, State, and certain other courts to consider military retired pay when fixing property rights between parties to a divorce, dissolution, annulment, or legal separation. Retirees whose former spouses receive a shared portion of the retirement pay do not pay income tax on that portion of retirement pay that is transferred to the former spouse, but the share transferred to the former spouse is taxable to the former spouse. In general, States may not tax retirement pay of military retirees if they do not tax the benefits received by retired State and local government employees.Barker v.

Racing career=1982: two-year-old season Katsuragi Ace made a successful racecourse debut by winning a maiden race over 1200 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 19 September. After finishing second to Mejiro Mont Cenis over 1400 metres at the same track on 3 October he won the Rindo Tokubetsu over 1200 metres at Kyoto Racecourse two weeks later. On his final appearance of the year he finished third to Mejiro Mont Cenis over 1600 metres on 27 November. 1983: three-year-old season Katsuragi Ace began his second season by finishing unplaced over 1600 metres at Kyoto in February and then won the Shunran Sho at Hanshin in March. At Nakayama Racecourse in April he contested the Satsuki Sho (the first leg of the Japanese Triple Crown) and finished unplaced behind Mr. C.B.. On 8 May he recorded his most important success up to that point when he won the NHK Hai (the forerunner of the NHK Mile Cup) over 2000 metres at Tokyo Racecourse. Three weeks later he finished sixth behind Mr C B in the Tokyo Yushun. He ended the first half of his season by finishing sixth to Nihon Pillow Winner over 1400 metres at Chukyo Racecourse on 26 June. After a summer break, Katsuragi Ace returned on 2 October and finished second to Suzuka Koban in the Kobe Shimbun Hai at Hanshin. Katsuichi Nishiura took over from Sakiyama when the colt appeared in the Kyoto Shimbun Hai three weeks later and won from Lead Hoyu and Dokan Yashima. Nishiura rode Katsuragi Ace in all of his subsequent races. The colt ended his season by finishing unplaced behind Mr C B in the Kikuka Sho at Kyoto on 13 November. 1984: four-year-old season In 1984 the system of Graded stakes races was introduced in Japan. On his first run as a four-year- old Katsuragi Ace finished fourth in the Naruo Kinen at Hanshin on 11 March and then won the Grade II Sankei Osaka Hai on 1 April, beating the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup winner Long Grace. On 13 May at Kyoto he defeated Sunny Ciboulette (Hanshin Futurity takes) and the mare Global Dyna to win the Grade III Keihan Hai. On his next appearance the colt was moved up to Grade I class for the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres at Hanshin on 3 June. He won by one and a quarter lengths from Suzuka Koban, with Global Dyna taking third place. Three weeks later he ended his spring and summer campaign by finishing fifth in the Takamatsunomiya Cup at Chukyo Racecourse. On 7 October Katsuragi Ace returned in the Grade II Mainichi Okan over 1800 metres at Tokyo and defeated Mr C B by a head. In the autumn edition of the Grade I Tenno Sho three weeks later he finished fifth of the fifteen runners behind Mr C B. On 25 November, in front of a crowd of 112,000 at Tokyo, Katsuragi Ace was one of fourteen horses to contest the fourth running of the Japan Cup and started a 40/1 outsider. The three previous editions of the race had been won by two horses from North America (Mairzy Doates and Half Iced) and one from Europe (Stanerra). The Japanese runners were headed by Mr C B and Symboli Rudolf meaning that the race featured the first showdown between two Triple Crown winners in Japanese racing history. The overseas challengers included Strawberry Road, Kiwi and Bounty Hawk (VRC Derby) from Australasia, Majesty's Prince from America and the British-trained gelding Bedtime. Wearing a distinctive white hood, Katsuragi Ace went to the front soon after the start and opened up a big lead, but appeared to weaken approaching the final turn and faced several challengers early in the straight. He rallied strongly in the closing stages, however, and won by one and a half lengths from Bedtime, with Symboli Rudolf in third, Majesty's Prince fourth and Mr C B unplaced. On his final racecourse appearance, Katsuragi Ace was invited to contest the Arima Kinen at Nakayama on 23 December. He finished second to Symboli Rudolf, with Mr C B in third. Stud record Katsuragi Ace was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. His only Graded Stakes winner was the mare Yamanin Marine who won the Grade II Sankei Sports Sho Yonsai Himba Tokubetsu in 1991. The stallion died of heart failure on 3 July 2000.

The unit was recruited by Colonel William H. Young at Philadelphia during July and August 1861. Company A was formed around a local independent cavalry company, the Merchants' Troop of Philadelphia. As companies were formed, they were immediately sent to Camp Park in Washington, DC, for outfitting and training. Among those who assisted in their training was Lieutenant George A. Custer. The regiment was initially named the Kentucky Light Cavalry in an effort to influence citizens of that border state to remain in the Union. Although the first Pennsylvania cavalry unit formed in response to President Lincoln's call for volunteers, this initial designation caused it to lose its numbering priority to regiments formed later.William Brooke-Rawle, et al., History of the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry, Sixtieth Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, in the American Civil War, 1861-1865.

As well as the plays of William Shakespeare and his contemporaries, TAW produces new work from living artists and develops creative links with theatre-makers. TAW will celebrate its 50 anniversary in March 2016. Foundation and history In December 1963, ten members organized a theatre play and put through a programme – An Evening with Young Actors – which included Edna St. Vincent Millay’s Aria da Capo, scenes from Twelfth Night and Macbeth, The Valiant and a dramatized reading of Hamlet, Eliot, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. Raj Bisaria produced and directed all the plays, and decided to register a theatre group with a managing body and using local talent. A bilingual group theatre (English and Hindi), the central concern the development of a genuine interest in theatre- craft and creating within its scope, a theatre-consciousness, an ability to appreciate the drama of ideas and technique. Bisaria financed the project, selected members for the committee, picked out a group of four English actors and helpers, and established what has since then been called Theatre Arts Workshop. Thus in 1966, Theatre Arts Workshop (TAW) was founded by Raj Bisaria, as a president and artistic director, with the aim of creating interest in dramatic arts among the young, and help them to develop an insight into acting, direction and allied arts. The name ‘Theatre Arts Workshop’ is for theatre and allied performing arts; its members are to be exposed to workshop methods of representation. TAW was to be a training organization and then a performing group, with its motto ‘training before performance’. Its philosophy is \\"your right is to work only, but never the fruit thereof. Let not the fruit of action be your object, nor let your attachment be to inaction.\\" – Sri Krishna to sorrowing Arjuna (The Bhagvadgita, chapter II - 47) A token grant has been given by the Government of India – sufficient to meet the expenditure for one production. Theatre William Shakespeare’s Othello was the first play performed by the group, on 12 February 1966. It was adapted to be played by four actors, all British, and directed by Raj Bisaria, in the English language. TAW has mounted over eighty major theatre productions till now. They have included performances both in English and Hindustani, and have included a range of plays from the US and England, major European plays and Indian plays drawn from various regional languages and Hindi. The productions have been interspersed with workshops, talks, arts shows and exchange programmes. TAW mounted on stage the plays by European, American and Indian playwrights; its repertory including a selection from William Shakespeare, G.B. Shaw, Sartre, Ionesco, Christopher Fry, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Noël Coward, Ronald Duncan, Rattigan, Harold Pinter, Peter Shaffer, Jean Anouilh, Maxwell Anderson, Mohan Rakesh, Badal Sircar, Adya Rangacharya, Dharamvir Bharati, Shesh and Mohit Chatterjee and productions of Ann Jellicoe, Edward Albee and Orton, which proved too radical in the context of existing provincial attitudes which TAW is trying to change. English theatre The TAW started its venture in English language with Shakespeare’s Othello in 1966, Christopher Fry's poetic play A Phoenix too Frequent and Eugène Ionesco’s absurdist play The Lesson in 1967. In 1967 Raj Bisaria decided to produce and direct Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist In Camera, Edna St. Vincent Millay’s Aria Da Capo and Ronald Duncan’s translation of 12th century classic Abelard and Heloise in a three-bill presentation, in November, 1967. These were crucial productions as TAW’s audience wavered between shocked admiration and shocked disgust. Hindi and Urdu theatre Raj Bisaria invited Delhi groups to produce, under TAW’s auspices, plays in Hindi with a view to making local groups conscious of the potentialities and challenges of Hindi theatre. TAW’s first Hindi play was Baqi Itihas, a translation of Badal Sircar’s Bengali play on a thrust stage. It was a non-realistic presentation, using giant slides and specially designed music, the first production of the kind in the country. Baqi Itihas was followed by a wide range of plays in translation from English, Bengali, Marathi, Kannada, in addition to those originally in Hindi; Andha Yug, Suno Janmejaya, Aadhe-Adhure, The Cave Dwellers, Antigone, Garbo, Candida, Father, Sleuth, Barefoot in Athens The Caretaker, The Public Eye etc. Arts Apart from the theatre TAW also introduced other allied performing arts for the very first time, like Irshad Panjatan’s Indian mime in 1967, and modern dance by America’s Murray Louise Dance Company in 1968, Indian classical dance by Sonal Mansingh in 1970, Om Shivpuri’s Hindi theatre group Dishanter in 1973, Richard Schechners’ environmental theatre presentation of Mother Courage and Her Children from New York in 1976, and painting exhibition of R.S. Bisht’s miniatures in 1973 and the Annapolis Brass Quintet in 1981. Workshop With its motto training before performance, TAW has been conducting comprehensive theatre workshops since 1966, for young theatre aspirants. Its training primarily focuses on psychological and realistic acting, with special attention on voice and body. As of 2015 over 100 acting and theatre workshops have been organised by TAW.

The most striking is that of the child to whom Francis threw a firebrand, flying like an arrow, and it landed on the rock wall of a hill owned by a lord of Greccio, the Velita. This same Velita in 1223 pushed Francis to give life to a splendid evocation, with live people, the birth of Christ on Christmas Eve. Legend has it that a little boy, the only character not part of the living re-enactment, came to life during the event, before returning to death. Since then, Greccio and its sanctuary is the country of the first nativity scene in the world. Later it was twinned with Bethlehem. Sanctuary and Chapel The shrine is a Latin cross, characterized by a side wall and an apse hexagonal. The mullioned windows are Gothic style.

Palace is owned by the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts and currently hosts its Institute for the History of Croatian Literature, Theater and Music. History On the site of today's Palace there was a once monastery used by the Order of Saint Clare. After the order was abolished in 1782 the land was abandoned until Count Karlo Drašković bought it in 1835 with intention to build a residential palace for his family. The Palace was complicated in late 1838, and is considered to be the work of architect Bartol Felbinger. This is corroborated by the fact that Felbinger was sued in 1843 because the portico on the east facade of the Palace collapsed. The only question is whether Felbinger built the Palace according to his own plans, because the 3 blueprints which are kept in the Croatian History Museum are unsigned and undated. At the time of construction the Palace was one of the most beautiful palaces on the Upper Town. It was built in the neoclassical style with overdressed facade and impressive classicist interior. Drašković family never fully settled in their newly built home, so they sold it under favorable terms to the members of the Illyrian movement. Specifically, in year 1845 the Illyrians heard that Count Drašković was selling his Palace with more than 30 rooms for 28 thousand silver florins, or 25 silver florins for each room. They intended to place the National Museum with reading room and casino, as well as the Croatian-Slavonian Economic Society into the Palace. On February 27, 1846 they bought the Palace and named it the National Home or National Hall, after the largest room which they used for social gatherings, balls and various assemblies. The original purchase agreement is today kept in the National and University Library. Luxurious hall known as the Casino, National Hall, Hall of Zagreb, Illyrian Hall, and most recently Revival Hall, dominates Palaces interior. In the central part of the ground floor the Croatian National Museum was hosted since 1846, while the wings housed the Husbandry society, reading room and casino. The interior was renovated by architect Aleksandar Brdarić. This Palace became the center of all important cultural, educational and other social events of the 19th century Zagreb, while the hall was used for political gatherings and balls. On March 25, 1848 the Demands of the Nation were adopted on the session of the Grand National Assembly that was held in the grand hall. From 1868 to 1880 the National Home palace was seat of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (today Croatian). In 1878, palace was purchased by the state which turned it into the seat of the Table of Seven, supreme court of the Kingdom of Croatia- Slavonia. The Palace was owned by the state until the end of World War II when it was given to the Academy. Palace lost its original charm over the years because it was redesigned into the office space. It was brought back into its original state in 1994, when the last renovation was completed. Today, Palace hosts the Institute for the History of Croatian Literature, Theater and Music of the Croatian Academy of Science and Arts.

In 1902 he returned to the Agricultural School to assist Andrew Ferguson, BSc in what proved to be the last year agricultural subjects were offered. He joined the Education Department as a student teacher to avail himself of free tuition at the University of Adelaide, where as what the Public Service Review called \\"one of the most talented students which the University of Adelaide has produced\\" he achieved his BA in 1907, BSc (Agric) in 1908 and MA in 1909. His thesis on \\"The milling qualities and chemical properties of flour from high and low grade wheats\\" won praise from Sydney University assessors. He was joint winner of the John Howard Clark Scholarship for English Literature in 1907. His teaching duties took him to Moonta Mines and Port Adelaide Public Schools, after which he joined the University Training College, where he was appointed assistant lecturer. Career In 1908 Richardson accepted the position of Assistant Director of Agriculture, and was involved with the Director, Professor William Angus in research. In 1909 he took up residence at the Parafield Experimental Farm, where he was responsible for the breeding of several new varieties of wheat. He acted as Director of Agriculture for a few months in 1911 between the resignation of Angus and the appointment of Professor William Lowrie. In June 1911 Richardson was appointed Agricultural Superintendent and Chief of the Division of Agriculture in Victoria. He established research stations at Werribee and Rutherglen, and did much to reverse farmers' antipathy to modern farming methods. From 1917 to 1919 he lectured part-time at the University of Melbourne, and was appointed Director of the School of Agriculture then when the Faculty of Agriculture was created, he was appointed inaugural Dean. In 1924 the University conferred on him the honour of Doctor of Science. In 1924 he accepted the position of Waite Professor of Agriculture with the University of Adelaide and returned to South Australia to become the first Director of the Waite Agricultural Research Institute. He directed research into water and nitrogen requirements of different crops. He was Commonwealth delegate to the first Imperial Agricultural Research Conference in London in 1927, and in 1932 was one of the official advisers to the Australian delegation at the Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa. George Julius, Rivett, Richardson In 1938, he was appointed Deputy chief executive officer for CSIR and in 1946 was promoted to chief executive officer, succeeding Sir David Rivett, who had been made chairman. Responding to Federal (Liberal) Opposition claims of Communist influence and leakage of secrets from the CSIR, the Chifley Labor government, through the relevant Minister John Dedman, placed the CSIR under the control of a five-man Executive. Rivett refused to continue under this regime and in March 1949 resigned. Richardson followed, citing health reasons, quite plausible, as he died five months later. But Rivett's son Rohan Rivett was in no doubt both resignations were protests against Government interference in the functioning of the organisation, envisaged by its founder Stanley Bruce as truly independent of both Government and Public Service. Memberships He was in 1923 President of section K (agriculture and forestry) of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science (now ANZAAS). He was, from 1935 to 1936, the first president of the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science. (Prof. J.A. Prescott was the first president of the South Australian branch).

In 1928 he was elected to the national Reichstag, where he sat as a Communist member. In 1933 he escaped with his family to the Soviet Union. The next year he infiltrated back into Germany with false papers. He was arrested in 1935, but survived ten years in detention, re-emerging in 1945 as a leading regional politician in occupied Bavaria. He left the Communist party in 1947. Life Heinrich Schmitt was born into a working-class family in Waldbüttelbrunn, a small town a short distance to the west of Würzburg. While his father went out to work his mother maintained a small-holding. Schmitt trained as a machinist and in 1913, the year of his eighteenth birthday, joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD). He was conscripted into the army in 1915, but his military career was cut short by a head wound, and by the end of 1916 he was working for BASF in Ludwigshafen. In 1917 the SPD split, primarily over the issue of whether or not to continue supporting the country's participation in the war, and Schmitt switched to the breakaway Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD / Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). 1917 was also the year in which he relocated the Dresden region, obtaining work with the giant Leuna plant. He stayed with Leuna until 1930, joining the company's works council. The political left splintered further in the chaotic aftermath of World War I, and in 1920 Schmitt joined the newly formed German Communist Party (KPD). By this time he had married Anna Nawroth, and their son Harry Schmitt had been born in Halle on 17 September 1919. As a political activist, Schmitt became known as a skilled and effective speaker. Having joined the works council at Leuna, he became its president in the mid-1920s, and was re-appointed to that post in 1928 and 1929 despite his increasing level of high-level political engagement outside the factory gates. Between 1928 and 1930, he was in the national Reichstag, representing the Merseburg electoral district. The political left continued to be prone to factionalism, and as a member of the increasingly marginalised Conciliator faction within the German Communist Party, in 1930 Schmitt lost his position on the Leuna works council, and also lost his job with Leuna. At the same time, the party withdrew his Reichstag mandate and he lost his seat there. He nevertheless remained loyal to the party, respecting party discipline. Later in 1930 Schmitt emigrated to the Soviet Union, taking work as a skilled machinist, working initially at the \\"Hammer & Sickle\\" plant in Moscow. However, he soon found himself removed from the factory to the Moscow International Lenin School. He returned to Germany in July 1931, where the Party Central Committee installed him as General Secretary of the \\"Chemicals Industry Workers' International\\" and as General Secretary of the \\"International Rubber Industry Workers' Organisation\\". Early in 1933 régime change came to Germany and the Hitler government lost little time in imposing a one-party government. Membership of the KPD was banned. Schmitt emigrated with his family back to the Soviet Union, where he resumed his employment as a machinist, while also working voluntarily with the \\"Chemicals Industry Workers' International\\". In June 1934 he was sent to Prague, from where he went on to the Saarland as a Party Central Committee instructor, while his wife Anna and their son Harry remained in the Soviet Union (until after the Second World War). Schmitt traveled in Germany during this time with a false passport, using the name \\"Walter Scheublein\\", and was also operating from his Saarland base as a senior consultant to the trade- union movement in the Rhineland. He was also a member of the Berlin-based national leadership team of the illegal trades union movement. On 7 May 1935 Schmitt was arrested in Cologne. Nearly two years of investigative detention followed. On 8 February 1937 he appeared before the Special Court (Volksgerichtshof), created by the government the previous year to handle a wide range of political cases. The court gave him a fifteen-year custodial sentence. Schmitt was released from Landsberg Prison by the United States Army on 27 April 1945 and reactivated his Communist party membership. On 1 September 1945 he took a job as an inspector with the health insurance administration (Krankenkasse) in Würzburg, a position he held only until 22 October 1945, by which time he joined the Bavarian regional government. During the first week of October the Bavarian chief minister, Wilhelm Hoegner, appointed him Bavarian Secretary of State for Special Projects (\\"...für Sonderaufgaben\\"), a newly created post. The creation of the office appears to have resulted from an initiative by the US occupation forces, and responsibilities included \\"denazification\\" (\\"Entnazifizierung \\"). Between 8 March 1946 and 24 June 1946, he was the sole representative of the Communist Party of Germany on the committee (\\"Vorbereitender Verfassungsausschuss\\") convened to prepare a new constitution. Between 30 June 1946 and 26 October 1946, he was a member of the regional assembly that produced the new Bavarian constitution. During this period Schmitt was also a member of the Communist party secretariat in Bavaria, but he came into conflict with the party, which criticised his ministerial conduct. His lifestyle was deemed \\"insufficiently comradely\\".\\"Der Lebenswandel des Genossen Schmitt erscheine zu wenig genossenhaft\\" He resigned his ministerial office in July 1946 and his Communist party membership on 19 October 1947. (Other sources imply that he was excluded from the party, but either way, the decision appeared to have been a mutual one.) Between 1947 and 1949, Schmitt was a member of the Bavarian Senate as a trade union representative. However, this was evidently not a time-consuming responsibility, and during the closing part of the 1940s he also focused on business interests. Schmitt died in Munich on 13 August 1951. Harry Schmitt Heinrich Schmitt's son, Harry Schmitt, known also by his \\"Nom de Guerre\\" as Ralf Forster, achieved notability on his own account, although his role was little publicised until after his death in 1999. During the Cold War, Harry Schmitt led the Ralf Forster Group, a secret military organisation sponsored by the East German party leadership which was seen as the military wing of the Communist Party in West Germany.

Operated between about 1906 and 1991, it is believed to be the last intact early 20th-century herring processing facility in the state. It is now owned by a local preservation group, hosts a museum and other facilities. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The McCurdy Smokehouse is set on a collection of adjacent pile wharves on the Lubec waterfront, near the junction of Water and School Streets. It is an assemblage of nine buildings, some purpose-built, some adapted to the purpose, which were mostly built between 1895 and 1941. All are wood frame structures, one and two stories in height. The oldest building is a c. 1860 Greek Revival retail building, which was adapted for use by the operators of the smokehouse as a warehouse sometime between 1921 and 1933. The history of the smokehouse begins in 1907, when Robert McBridge purchased an unused wharf and built a smokehouse on it. He also acquired several adjacent buildings, that had previously housed other businesses, and adapted them for the specialized activities related to pickling and smoking herring. McBride's was one of thirteen herring smokehouses in Lubec, and the complex, expanded by his successors in the business, operated until 1991. From 1959 to 1995 the complex was owned by members of the McCurdy family. It was sold in 1995 to Lubec Landmarks, dedicated to its preservation. They have adapted the skinning/packing shed to house a museum on Lubec history, and are seeking adaptive uses for the other elements of the complex. During the January 2018 North American blizzard, the facility's former brining shed collapsed. Portions of the structure were found across the Lubec Narrows on the shore of Campobello Island in Canada. Recovery of the remains is complicated in part by legal disputes over Canadian salvage rights.

After his father died, he moved with his mother and her second husband to Portsmouth, where he started his career as a reporter for the Portsmouth Evening News. He began to specialise in show business interviews, before leaving the newspaper to work as a trainee screenwriter and talent booker for Associated London Scripts, where he worked with such stars as Frankie Howerd, Spike Milligan and Eric Sykes.

Retrieved 15 November 2015 As well as writing in a freelance capacity for Weekend, Record Mirror and other magazines, he appeared regularly on Southern TV's sports programmes during the early 1960s. In 1963, after seeing the Rolling Stones perform at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, he recommended them to Andrew Loog Oldham, who became their manager as a result. He actively championed Motown music before it became popular in the UK; John Schroeder, who brokered the first distribution deal for Motown in Britain, said of Jones that he was his only ally in promoting the release of early Motown material. In 1964, Jones was appointed as editor of Record Mirror, at the time one of the three main national music weeklies in the UK, and during the 1960s and early 1970s wrote hundreds of articles on pop music for the journal. He also wrote extensively in The Beatles Book monthly magazine, under the pseudonym Billy Shepherd, and in the Rolling Stones' magazine, as Peter Goodman. He wrote the first book- length biographies of both bands: The True Story of the Beatles (as Shepherd, 1964), and the Stones' Our Own Story (as Goodman, 1965). He supported and encouraged the early careers of such stars as Dusty Springfield, The Who, and, later, Jimi Hendrix. He also wrote biographies of Elvis Presley and Tom Jones, and was the ghostwriter of newspaper columns for many British pop stars in the 1960s, including Sandie Shaw and Dave Dee, and for footballers including George Best and Denis Law. After Billboard purchased Record Mirror in 1969, Jones continued to write for both publications, and for Music Week. He launched another magazine, Easy Listening, in 1972. For Billboard, he was successively news editor for British, European and international coverage and, finally, special issues editor, based in its London office.

Born in London, he was one of five children of Maria (nee Rossi) and Frank Gregori, who was the leader of a dance band that played at the Italian restaurant Quaglino's. Encouraged by his parents, who realised he was exceptionally musical, John studied the violin with the virtuoso teacher Alfredo Campoli and went on to take lessons in counterpoint and harmony at the London College of Music. After a brief stint as a violinist with his father’s band, by the late 1940s he was performing by himself and working as a staff arranger with Philips Records. His first broadcast as an arranger, for the BBC Revue Orchestra, aired in 1944. He was the BBC Radio Orchestra’s principal guest conductor for 17 years and continued to be recognised as one of the best and most innovative orchestral composers and arrangers of his time. He also collaborated with vocalists including Cleo Laine and Nana Mouskouri. In the late 1950s, he recorded Latin-flavoured albums as Nino Rico, and then as Chaquito. In 1960, he began to make his own records, with The Cascading Strings, as part of the Philips record label’s easy listening albums. More unusual was Melodies of Japan (1963), a reworking of the traditional folk music of the far east. He scored several film and TV shows, including Serena (1962), Impact (1963), The Night Caller (1965) and Don't Drink the Water (1974). In the mid-1970s, he regularly recorded under his own name, producing albums such as A Man for All Seasons and The Detectives. He won an Ivor Novello Award in 1976 for \\"Introduction and Air to a Stained Glass Window\\". From 1974 to 1991 he was the conductor of the BBC Radio Orchestra. He composed his last film score in 2002. Gregory died in April 2020 at the age of 95.

Her work addresses contemporary popular culture by interrogating identity and vernacular aesthetics. Much of her works center on hip-hop culture, American politics, black vernacular and gender performance. Education + Teaching Moor received an MFA in printmaking from Tyler School of Art, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 1998 and a BFA in painting and printmaking from Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia in 1995. Moor is presently an Associate Professor in the Department of Printmedia, at School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL. Her prior appointment was at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. With regards to her role as an educator, Moor “would like young artists to trust their own voice more, and not look for their work to be praised by their elders as much. Sometimes it’s disheartening to hear students say they don’t know what to think about something, and always looking for a ‘right’ answer. I want younger artists to recognize their value, and express themselves accordingly“. Artworks She appropriates and revises existing material to invert and expand meaning. \\"My work explores the way popular culture is an articulation of our desires, our fears, our fantasies,\\" Moor has explained. \\"I think I have always been sensitive to the need to self-define, because black people in America have historically been affected by the ways in which others have defined them. For me, to revise: is to act upon a history. It is both an acknowledgement of history, a critique of it, and an alternative view. I am intrigued by the social constructs of race, just as I am intrigued by gender and sexuality. In my work I often play upon notions that we think of as fixed, to invite new definitions.\\" Selected projects She exhibited her work alongside Krista Franklin at the Produce Mode Gallery in Chicago in 2017, in a show entitled Quiet Storm. In 2015, Moor's collaboration with Jasmine Hearn was included in Flow at the Studio Museum in Harlem. Flow was the fourth in the F-Series exhibitions at the Studio Museum. The piece is a performance artwork that translates drawing into sound and sound into movement. Flow is a response to the 1982 collaboration of Bill T. Jones and Keith Haring, Long Distance.

It was founded by the philanthropist George Peabody in 1866 at the behest of his nephew Othniel Charles Marsh, the early paleontologist. Most known to the public for its Great Hall of Dinosaurs, which includes a mounted juvenile Brontosaurus and the long mural The Age of Reptiles, it also has permanent exhibits dedicated to human and mammal evolution; wildlife dioramas; Egyptian artifacts; and the birds, minerals and Native Americans of Connecticut. The Peabody Museum is located at 170 Whitney Avenue in New Haven, Connecticut, United States, and is run by almost one hundred staff members. While the original building was demolished in 1917, it moved to its current location in 1925, and has since expanded to occupy the Peabody Museum, the attached Kline Geology Laboratory and the Class of 1954 Environmental Sciences Center, parts of three additional buildings, and a field station at the Long Island Sound. The museum also owns Horse Island in the Thimble Islands, which is not opened to the public, but used for experiments. The Class of 1954 Environmental Science Center, completed in 2001 and connected to the museum and the adjacent Kline Geology Laboratory, hosts approximately one-half of the museum's 13 million specimens. On August 28, 2018, Yale University announced a contribution of $160 million by Edward P. Bass '67 toward the renovation of the Museum. The landmark commitment ranks among the most generous gifts to Yale and is the largest known gift ever made to a natural history museum in the United States. Bass's contribution will help to fund the renewal and expansion of the acclaimed museum. The full scope and timeline for the renovation are still under development, but the galleries were planned to be open through June 30, 2020 (the Great Hall of Dinosaurs was open through January 1, 2020), but had to close in March due to COVID-19 and did not reopen before July 1, 2020. Fundraising for the project is ongoing. The Peabody has several world-important collections. Perhaps the most notable are the vertebrate paleontology collections, among the largest, most extensive, and most historically important fossil collections in the United States (see Othniel Charles Marsh, R.S. Lull, George Gaylord Simpson, John Ostrom, Elisabeth Vrba, and Jacques Gauthier), and the Hiram Bingham Collection of Incan artifacts from Machu Picchu, named for the famous Yale archaeologist who rediscovered this Peruvian ruin. Also notable are the extensive ornithology collection, one of the largest and most taxonomically inclusive in the world, and the associated William Robertson Coe Ornithology Library, one of the best in the United States. The collection of marine invertebrates is additionally extensive, having benefitted from the work of such prolific invertebrate zoologists as Addison Emery Verrill. Faculty curators for the collections are drawn from Yale's departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Geology and Geophysics, and Anthropology. Because these departments maintain a strong tradition of hiring faculty who will perform collections-based research, especially after the renewed support for organismal biology at Yale under President Richard Charles Levin and in particular former provost Alison Richard, nearly all of the collections are under active internal use and enjoy continuous and considerable growth. The Yale Herbarium is part of the Peabody Museum.  Torosaurus  The museum has erected the first full-scale reproduction of a Torosaurus on Whitney Avenue next to the entrance. The 3 m (9 ft) tall, 7 m (21 ft) long, 3.33 metric ton (7,350 lb) statue was sculpted in clay and cast in bronze, and set on a 4 m (13 ft) tall granite base. The reproduction of T. latus is scientifically faithful of T. latus, and its skin is based on the fossilized skin impressions left by a Chasmosaurus (a closely related ceratopsid).The Torosaurus Project. Exhibits The Great Hall of Dinosaurs Permanent exhibits include: * The Great Hall of Dinosaurs with the skeleton of a Brontosaurus. ** The Age of Reptiles Mural is a long depiction of dinosaurs in their natural habitats. It was painted by Rudolph F.

Staff The current director of the Peabody Museum is David Skelly, a Curator of Vertebrate Zoology and a Professor of Ecology in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology and the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. The Peabody Museum has curators representing Anthropology, Botany, Entomology, Invertebrate Zoology, Invertebrate Paleontology, Vertebrate Zoology (with individual curators for Herpetology, Ichthyology, Mammalogy, and Ornithology), Paleobotany, Vertebrate Paleontology, Mineralogy & Meteoritics, and Historical Scientific Instruments. There are almost 100 full and part-time staff, including curators, assistant curators, curators emeriti, curatorial affiliates, and volunteers. Curators and assistant curators are also faculty members in related departments. History The museum as shown on a postcard mailed in 1909 Othniel Charles Marsh was an undergraduate and later the Professor of Paleontology at Yale University. His education was paid for by his wealthy uncle George Peabody, who began to donate much of his accumulated wealth to various educational institutions at the end of his life. Marsh and his teams discovered dozens of new genera of dinosaurs, including triceratops, stegosaurus and apatosaurus. At the request of Marsh, and to house some of his discoveries, Peabody founded Yale's Museum of Natural History in 1866 with a gift of $150,000. Yale's collection at the time was mostly minerals, collected by the geologist and mineralogist Benjamin Silliman. Marsh was one of the museum's first three curators, and when Peabody died in 1869 he used his inheritance to fund expeditions which greatly increased the museum's collections. His primary interest was dinosaurs, and during the infamous period in paleontological history known as the Bone Wars, he discovered 56 new species of dinosaur and shipped literally tons of fossils back from the American Southwest. His finds also included fossils of vertebrates and invertebrates, trackways of prehistoric animals, and archaeological and ethnological artifacts. The museum officially opened to the public in 1876. In 1917, it was demolished and replaced by the Harkness Memorial Quadrangle dormitory. Due to World War I, most of the collections were put in storage until December 1925, when the current building was dedicated. The new building had a great, 2-story hall designed specifically to hold Marsh's dinosaurs. Some other significant events include: * In 1930, donation of the Harry Payne Bingham Oceanographic Collection, including the work of artist Wilfrid Swancourt Bronson. * In 1931, the mounting of Marsh's Brontosaurus was finished, after 6 years of work. * In 1947, Rudolph F. Zallinger finished painting dinosaurs in their natural habitats in his long mural The Age of Reptiles, after 3-1/2 years of work. * In 1959, Bingham Laboratory was completed. * In 1963, Kline Geology Laboratory was completed. * In 1972, the Birds of Connecticut Hall opened. * In 2001, the interdisciplinary Class of 1954 Environmental Science Center was constructed on the site of the former Bingham Laboratory. It houses collections space for the museum and laboratory space for several curators. * In 2005, the Peabody unveiled its 21-foot life-size bronze sculpture of Torosaurus—one of O.C. Marsh's famed dinosaur discoveries. The 7,350-pound sculpture sits on a 13-foot, 70-ton base of Stony Creek granite. * In 2018, the Peabody announced a $160 million transformative gift toward a redefining renovation that will greatly expand its research capabilities, education and collection centers, and its exhibition galleries.  Popular culture  * The museum was featured in The Simpsons episode \\"Burns, Baby Burns\\". In the episode Mr. Burns has a relationship with Lily Bancroft and produce an illegitimate son played by Rodney Dangerfield. He flashes back to 1939 for his 25th graduation class reunion.

History On November 15, 1504, Pope Julius II issued the Papal Bull Illius fulciti which erected the first ecclesiastical province in the New World consisting of the Archdiocese of Hyaguata (located at Santo Domingo), the Diocese of Magua (located at Concepción de La Vega), and the Diocese of Bayuna (located at Lares de Guahaba). As all the dioceses were located on the island of Hispaniola, the Spanish Crown requested that the Diocese of Bayuna be transferred to Puerto Rico. The Bull never went into effect due to the objection of Ferdinand II of Aragon who opposed that the Bull gave the dioceses the right to receive a portion of the earnings from the gold and precious stones discovered in the territory. On August 8, 1511, Pope Julius II issued a new Papal Bull Pontifax Romanus which extinguished the previously granted ecclesiastical province and its dioceses and reassigned their delegated bishops. Pedro Suárez de Deza, Bishop Elect of Hyaguata, was reassigned to the Diocese of Concepción de la Vega; Father Alonso Manso, Bishop Elect of Magua, was reassigned to the Diocese of Puerto Rico; and Francisco Garcia de Padilla, Bishop Elect of Bayuna, was reassigned to the Diocese of Santo Domingo.

A state of emergency was declared following the November 2015 Paris attacks, which expired, after five extensions, in November 2017. 'Frankrijk trekt onvoldoende lering uit de aanslagen' ('France learns not enough from the attacks'). NRC Handelsblad, 12 May 2016. Retrieved 19 November 2016. François Heisbourg is cited as saying: \\"The state of emergency has now been extended twice, the last time until end of July 2016\\". Four main provisions concern various kinds of \\"states of emergency\\" in France: two of those stem from the Constitution of France, and the other two from a statute: * Article 16 of the Constitution provides the President of France with \\"exceptional powers\\" (') in times of acute crisis. * Article 36 of the same constitution regulates \\"state of siege\\" ('). * The Act of 3 April 1955 allows the president to declare a \\"state of emergency\\". * The Act of 23 March 2020 allows the declaration of a \\"sanitary state of emergency\\", which allows the Prime Minister of France to take measures to protect public health during an epidemic, pandemic or health disaster endangering the country. There are distinctions between article 16, article 36, and the 1955 Act, which concern mainly the distribution of powers. These dispositions have been used at various times, in 1955, 1958, 1961, 1988, 2005, and 2015-2017.  Legal framework  The French constitution, adopted in October 1958, was drafted taking into account the difficulties experienced by the executive in 1940 during the Battle of France and the contemporary state of affairs, namely the Algerian war.  Article 16 of the Constitution – '  Article 16 of the constitutionText of the Article 16 in the French Constitution on Légifrance grants the President of France \\"extraordinary powers\\" in exceptional cases, leading to an effective \\"state of exception\\": The conditions are both that the state is confronted with exceptional circumstances and that the regular institutions are disrupted and cannot govern effectively.Les pouvoirs exceptionnels du président, official governmental website This amendment to the constitution of the French Fifth Republic has been qualified as \\"liberticide\\" by critics. Invoked on 23 April 1961 during the Algerian War; normal functioning of institutions was quickly restored. In the judgment ' of 2 March 1962, the judged that it could not itself invoke Article 16, as that constituted an \\"act of government\\". Furthermore, the State Council considered that it could only pronounce on rulings which were not legislative acts carried out during this period. Thus, a legislative measure (although the role of Parliament is not specified, just that it is not to be dissolved) which breaches fundamental liberties cannot be appealed against before the State Council. In 1972, the Common Programme of the Left (issued from an alliance between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party) proposed to repeal Article 16. However, François Mitterrand's programme for the socialist presidential campaign in 1981, that he eventually won, did not include this proposition. In 1992, the socialist government of proposed to amend this article during a project of constitutional reform; however, the project was not implemented. Also in 1992, the Commission, created by , proposed to give to the ' (Constitutional Council), on the concerted initiative of the president of the Republic and the presidents of both chambers (the ' and the '), the mission to determine that the conditions required for the use of Article 16 were, in fact, met. On 23 July 2008, a constitutional act was passed which, among other amendments, added a paragraph to Article 16 of the constitutionLoi constitutionnelle no 2008-724 du 23 juillet 2008 de modernisation des institutions de la Ve République, Article 6 which stated that after 30 days the Constitutional Council can be requested to determine in a public ruling whether or not the conditions that justified the use of Article 16 are still current. At any time beyond 60 days, the Council rules on this issue without the need for a referral.  Article 36 of the Constitution – '  Article 36 of the constitution is concerned with the state of siege (, which can be decreed by the president in the Council of Ministers for a period of twelve days and which can only be extended with the approval of Parliament. A state of siege may be declared in case of an \\"imminent peril resulting from a foreign war [', or simply \\"war\\"] or an armed rebellion ('). La mise en oeuvre de l'état d'urgence [Putting in place a state of emergency] Military authorities may take police powers if they judge it necessary. Fundamental liberties may be restricted, such as the right of association, legalization of searches in private places day and night, the power to expel people who have been condemned for common law matters or people who do not have the right of residence in the territory, etc.  Statute provisions – '  The state of emergency in France is framed by the Law n°55-385 of 3 April 1955 (pre-dating the constitution of the Fifth Republic) and modeled on the \\"'\\". It was created in the context of the Algerian War, to allow the authorities to manage the crisis without having to declare the \\"'\\", which allows the military to take over a large part of the civilian authorities and which was conceived for wartime. The 1955 statute states that the state of emergency can be decreed by the president in the Council of Ministers. The decision to proclaim the state of emergency can only last for 12 days. To extend the state of emergency for a longer period of time necessitates a law passed regularly through the Parliament. Proclaiming the state of emergency gives exceptional powers to the Minister of the Interior and to prefects. The Minister can pronounce house arrests. The prefects can regulate or forbid circulation and gathering in some areas: the power of curfew, which mayors can pronounce for the territory of their city independently of the state of emergency, is extended to prefects. The Minister and the prefects can, for the part of the territory concerned by the state of emergency, order places of gathering to be closed. Authorities can also order that legally-detained weapons be relinquished to them. There is no need for the administration to motivate its decisions: house arrests or decisions forbidding someone to enter a defined area can be appealed. All of those powers are not enacted by the simple proclamation of the state of emergency but may be decided by the authorities if the need arises. If the decree, or later, the law, says so, the authorities can: * conduct administrative searches and seizures, day and night, without judiciary oversight, * censor the press, radio, films, and theater representations. Article 12 of the 1955 law allows, if a decree specifically provides it, the transfer of some crimes from the judicial jurisdiction to that of the military. This law is modeled after the society of the time, to deal with a specific crisis, and its objective was to prevent a civil war or very severe unrest emanating from a part of the population. Some parts have since become obsolete: * politically, censorship is not as acceptable in the twenty-first century as it was at the time the law (which mentions neither television nor the internet) was passed; * administrative search and seizures must now be submitted to judicial oversight; * the 2012 law on gun control Loi n° 2012-304 du 6 mars 2012 ' [Law number 2012-304 of 6 March 2012 on the establishment of a modern arms control, simplified and preventive] has rendered partly obsolete the possibility of a decree requiring citizens to relinquish legally-owned weapons, which were more common in the aftermath of World War II; * various terrorism laws have strengthened the criminal procedure since the 1980s: the powers available to the police and judges when investigating acts of terrorism are more extensive than those described in the 1955 law.  Sanitary state of emergency  To control the COVID-19 pandemic in France, the Parliament created a sanitary state of emergency (). To protect public health, the prime minister can: * regulate or prohibit the movement of people and vehicles and regulate access to public transport and the conditions of their use; * prohibit people from leaving their homes, except for necessary travel such as for medical or important familial appointments; * order measures aimed at the quarantine of persons likely to be affected; * order measures to place and keep in quarantine, at their home or any other suitable accommodation, the affected people; * order the provisional closure and regulate the opening, including the conditions of access and presence, of one or more categories of establishments open to the public as well as meeting places, guaranteeing the access of people to goods and basic necessities; * place restrictions on the freedom of assembly; * order the requisition of all persons and all goods and services necessary to combat the health disaster; * take temporary measures to control the prices of certain products; * take all measures to make available to patients appropriate medicines for the eradication of the health disaster; * take any other regulatory measure limiting the freedom to conduct business. This state of emergency is framed by the law of 23 March 2020 and can be declared in the Council of Ministers for a period of 2 months. Extensions to this must be voted for by Parliament.  Historical uses  Since 1955, a state of emergency has been decreed six times: * In 1955 during the Algerian War; * In 1958, due to the uprising in Algeria; * In 1961, after the Generals' putsch (invocation of article 16 from 23 April to 29 September 1961); * In 1984, in New Caledonia, amidst calls for independence in the territory; * During the 2005 civil unrest in France, President declared a state of emergency on 8 November 2005. It was extended for three months on 16 November by Parliament, which was dominated by the UMP majority. On 10 December 2005 France's highest administrative body, the Council of State, ruled that the three-month state of emergency decreed to guarantee calm following the unrest was legal. It rejected a complaint from 74 law professors and the Green party challenging the necessity of the state of emergency and stating that it compromised fundamental liberties. In its rejection the council of state declared that the conditions that led to the unrest (which began on 27 October), the rapid spread of violence, and the possibility that it could recur justified the state of emergency. * On 13 November 2015, immediately following the November 2015 Paris attacks. This was due to expire after four extensions in April or May 2017. First decree of 14 November, on LégifranceSecond decree of 14 November, on Légifrance , almost 3,600 houses had been raided under the state of emergency, leading to more than 400 arrests, the seizure of more than 500 weapons including 40 war weapons, and four or five of these raids led to a terrorism-linked judicial investigation. Some Muslim rights groups criticized the raids as unfairly targeting French Muslims, especially those of North African descent, claiming that they are conducted with little concern for civil rights, and pointing out that only one terrorism-related investigation had led to prosecution by August 2016. On 16 November 2016, President François Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced that the state of emergency would be extended until the 2017 French presidential election, stating that the measure would be necessary to protect rallies and other events during the electoral campaign. In the run up to his election as President, Emmanuel Macron stated that he would make a decision regarding the state of emergency once he had been briefed by the security services. On 24 May 2017, following a security meeting held to discuss the situation after the Manchester Arena bombing, he announced that he would ask parliament to extend the state of emergency until November 2017. This was approved by Parliament on 6 July 2017, extending the state of emergency until 1 November. New counter-terrorism legislation was approved on 3 October to supersede the state of emergency, which came to an end on 1 November.  References Further reading *Paye, Jean-Claude (January 2017).

Stony McBride, a young movie director and adopted son of an aging Hollywood star, is writing a film about Marco Polo, in which, it is hoped, his father will make a comeback.

Adding to the rapidly multiplying complications are Stony's mother (a transsexual, as she later confesses); a friend named Frank (who has been in space orbit for the past five years); a maid (who is impregnated astrally by Frank); and another friend, Larry (who is fitted with a set of mechanical legs). There is also an earthquake; the discovery of a planet; and the birth of a new hero (Stony himself?); all coming together, within the bizarre action of the play, to yield some chilling, albeit very funny, glimpses of the future that may await us all.\\" Productions The play was first produced by the Nantucket Stage Company, Nantucket, Massachusetts, in August 1973.

She was a recipient of the L'Oréal-UNESCO Fellowship for Women in Science in 2010, was selected as Colombian biologist of the year in 2012, and in 2013 was named by the BBC as one of the top ten women in science in Latin America. Biography Diana Marcela Bolaños Rodríguez was born in 1981 in Bogotá, Colombia, and grew up there. At the age of 19 she enrolled in the Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano at the campus in Santa Marta on the Caribbean side of Colombia. After completing her undergraduate work with a thesis on flatworms, in 2003, Bolaños continued her education at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in the United States. She received her PhD in zoology from UNH in Durham, New Hampshire, in 2008 with an Award for Excellence in Research from the Department of Zoology. Her research focused on polyclad flatworms, a marine worm which is unique in its ability to generate tissue through stem cells. She married an American, Joseph Dunn, whom she had met while in New Hampshire, and in 2008 returned to Colombia to continue her research, completing a database of flatworm species and their taxonomic groups. Bolaños also took a teaching post as a visiting professor for the University of the Andes (Uniandes). In 2010, she was awarded a L'Oréal-UNESCO Fellowship for Women in Science and she used the award to complete her postdoctoral research at Uniandes. Bolaños then took a post as an assistant professor in the Biology Program at the Universidad de Cartagena. In 2012 she was named Colombian biologist of the year and in 2013 was named one of the top ten women scientists in Latin America by the BBC. Despite the difficulties of finding funding for research, Bolaños has remained in Colombia, in part to inspire others' interests in science and in part to fill the gap because so many post-graduates from Colombia remain part of the diaspora. She has continued her research and is working on comparisons between polyclads, planarians and other types of platyhelminths and their abilities to regenerate. In addition, she has published numerous articles in international, peer-reviewed journals such as Evolution & Development, the Journal of Natural History and Zootaxa in the areas of evolution and biological systematics, as well as continuing her education at courses such as the Society for Developmental Biology short course held in Montevideo, Uruguay.

CranID was created in 1992 by anthropologist Richard Wright of the University of Sydney to infer the probable geographic origin of unknown crania that are found in archaeological, forensic and repatriation cases. Wright created the program to establish uniformity in cranial morphology based on the assumption that there is a high correlation between geographical location and cranial morphology. This was the first standardized program to evaluate the similarity and dissimilarity of cranial morphological characteristics of an unknown cranium and the database.  Software  CranID is a free software program that utilizes multivariate linear discriminant analysis and nearest neighbor discriminant analysis in conjunction with 29 cranial measurements to assess the geographic origin, which can be used to infer the ancestry of an unknown cranium. CranID compares an unknown cranium with 74 geographic samples, from 3,163 crania from 39 different populations.Hughes, S., Wright, R., Barry, M. \\"Virtual Reconstruction and Morphological Analysis of the Cranium of an Ancient Egyptian Mummy.\\" Australasian Physical & Engineering Sciences in Medicine. Volume 28 (2005). The measurements and landmarks used in this program to compare an unknown cranium with the database consist of glabello- occipital length, nasio-occipital length, basion-nasion length, basion-bregma height, maximum cranial breadth, maximum frontal breadth, biauricular breadth, biasterionic breadth, basion-prosthion length, nasion-prosthion height, nasal height and breadth, orbit height and breadth, bijugal breadth, palate breadth, bimaxillary breadth, zypomaxillary subtense, bifrontal breadth, nasio-frontal subtense, biorbital breadth, interorbital breadth, cheek height, frontal chord, nasion-bregma subtense (frontal subtense), parietal chord, bregma- lambda subtense (parietal subtense), occipital chord and lambda-opisthion subtense (occipital subtense). Each cranial measurement and their definitions were taken from W.W. Howells' data set.Cox, Margaret. The Scientific Investigation of Mass Graves: Towards Protocols and Standard Operating Procedures. Cambridge University Press 2008.  Data Set  The program compares unknown crania to 74 geographical samples that are from a collection of 3,163 crania from 39 different populations from around the world. This data set consists of W.W. Howells' 1973 study of cranial variation of 2,524 crania from 28 populations from around the world. This database also consists of measurements from Beduin crania provided by Martha Lahr, samples of measurements collected from Poundbury, a Romano-British 4th century AD site, and measurements from the Iron Age in Palestine and the Indian Subcontinent, provided by London’s Natural History Museum. Wright also added cranial measurements from Australian Aborigines form the Sydney area, which were provided by the La Perouse Aboriginal Land Council in conjunction with the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council. The data set also consists of cranial measurements from India, provided by P. Reghavan and D. Bulbeck, crania from Southern Italy, and Neolithic crania from Denmark, that were provided later by R. Kruszynski of the Natural History Museum, and P. Bennike of the Pranum Institute respectively.Wright R. Guide to Using the CRANID6 Programs CR6aIND: For Linear and Nearest Neighbours Discriminant Analysis. 2010. Available: http://www.box.net/shared/static/n9q0zgtr1y. EXE  Uses  This program is used to determine geographical origin of skeletal remains in archaeological and forensic contexts. Due to the geographical origin of the program and the author of the program, and the many crania included in the data set, this program is mainly used by Australian and British bioarchaeologists and forensic anthropologists. Forensic anthropologists use this software to determine the ancestry of unknown skeletal remains, in medico-legal contexts. The use of this program is designed to aid forensic anthropologists in the determination of the biological profile, which includes factors such as age, sex, stature and race. This biological profile is used to determine personal identification of skeletal remains from crime scenes, car and plane accidents, and mass disasters. Bioarchaeologists use this program in the same way as forensic anthropologists, but in more of an archaeology context. Determining ancestry in an archaeological context allows the researcher to build information on the skeletal remains that are found in archaeological burials, which aids in the development of knowledge of the culture and its practices and customs. This program is also used by many bioarchaeologists to conduct bio distance studies of skeletal remains, by comparing craniometric measurements of found archaeological remains with craniometric measurements of known skeletal remains from medical and legal institutions.  Criticisms  Although the maker of CranID does not explicitly state that this program can infer ‘race’, many forensic anthropologists use this program, and others like it, to determine the race of an unknown individual, even though many biological anthropologists have criticized the use of the concept. A study conducted on the CranID program found that while the program is \\"supposed to allocate an individual skull to a specific population rather than a ‘major race’,\\" the program did not generate persuasive allocations of individual crania to a geographical population. Another criticism is the fact that many of the measurements that are essential to this program are subject to both interobserver error and intraobserver error. Measurements between researchers can vary substantially in size and that this degree of variation in measurements can have a striking effect on the results of CranID. Due to this potential error, the results of CranID should be taken into account when assessing how accurate any findings formed by CranID are.Smith, Martin J. A Study of Interobserver Variation in Cranial Measurements and the Resulting Consequences when Analysed Using CranID. Proceedings of the 12th Annual Conference of the British Association for Biological Anthropology and Osteoarchaeology British Archaeological Reports, International Series 2380, Edited by Buckberry J., Mitchell P.D., 01/2012; Archaeopress. Although the combined data set that CranID utilizes includes many geographical regions, there are still many regions that are not accounted for in this data set. According to Fenja Theden-Ringl and colleagues, the use of CranID and another forensic anthropology software program, FORDISC, were unable to place skeletal remains from two site found in Arnhem Land, Northern Territory of Australia. The researchers believe that both these programs were unable to accurately assign the skeletal remains to any group due to both programs lacking Indonesian data in the databases that are used by these programs.

Early life  Genuth was the son of Isaac Genuth and Elka Kaner (granddaughter of Rabbi Yehuda Modern, head of the Yeshiva in Sighet). He emigrated to the United States in 1922.  Education  Genuth was a student at the Yeshiva of the Grand Rabbi of Viseu before emigrating to the United States in 1922. He continued his studies at the graduate school of Yeshiva University in New York, the Yeshiva in New Haven, Connecticut, and the Yale University Divinity School. Genuth was ordained in 1926.  Professional life  In 1930, Genuth was appointed as the first Rabbi of Beth Israel Synagogue in Norwalk, Connecticut where he was an active supporter of the Norwalk Hospital. In 1931 he moved to Cleveland and in 1933 he was appointed the first rabbi at the Kinsman Jewish Center. At the Kinsman Jewish Center, whose membership included many members of the radical Labor Movement, Genuth created an important congregation by applying a modern view of Orthodoxy. In 1950, after a disagreement with board members, Genuth left the Kinsman Jewish Center with eight families establishing Temple Beth El which described itself as \\"egalitarian/traditional\\" and was particularly notable for its seating of men and women together. The congregation moved into its building on Chagrin Blvd in 1954 - the first synagogue within the city limits of Shaker Heights. Genuth served as Temple Beth El's sole rabbi until his death in 1974. Throughout the 1930s, Genuth was active with the Orthodox Jewish Children's Home and the Mt. Pleasant Consumptive Ladies Aid Society. Genuth was also active in aiding the United Order of True Sisters, the American Jewish Congress and was an organizer of the Jewish Community Council serving as a representative to its delegate assembly. Genuth served as chaplain for Jewish patients at Highland View Hospital. He later served on the hospital's chapel building committee which accepted his recommendation for a revolving pulpit to accommodate Jewish patients. Genuth gave monthly lectures at the Montefiore Home.  Views  A lifelong Zionist, Genuth was a member of the Cleveland Zionist Society, attending their first organizing meeting at the behest of Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver, and was an active supporter of the Jewish National Fund and Israel Bonds.  Personal life  Genuth married Anna Einhorn (daughter of Reverend Chaim Einhorn) on February 2, 1929. They had three children. Saul, Phyllis Genuth and Esther. Genuth's parents and two of his three siblings perished in the Holocaust. Genuth died on February 23, 1974.

It is a savory butter that is used on meats such as steak (including the chateaubriand sauce for chateaubriand steak), fish, vegetables and other foods. It may be used in place of a sauce, and can significantly enhance a dish's flavor. Some variations with a sweet flavor exist. It is usually served cold as sliced disks on foods, and is sometimes served as a side condiment. Etymology The name of Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is derived from the manner in which it was commonly prepared from scratch by a restaurant's maître d'hôtel at diners' tables. It is also referred to as Maître d'Hôtel butter. Preparation Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory butter prepared by mixing softened butter with very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper has also been used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden. Uses Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is usually served cold as sliced disks atop various foods, and sometimes as a side condiment. It is used on grilled meats such as steak and fish, and also on eggs, vegetables, potatoes and breads. Some variations exist, including a few sweet versions that include sugar, which may be used on dishes such as pancakes. When used as a topping, it is typically added just before the dish is served. It has also been served melted atop dishes, whereby it is placed atop foods during the last few minutes of cooking. It may be used in the place of a sauce, and a small amount can significantly add to a dish's overall flavor. In Chateaubriand sauce Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is used as an ingredient in Chateaubriand sauce, which is sometimes used in the preparation of Chateaubriand steak. The butter is used in the last stage of the sauce's preparation, whereby after the sauce is strained, it is finished with Beurre Maître d'Hôtel. Chopped tarragon may also be added to the sauce during this last preparation stage.

Guntzepaula is a Taiwanese indie power trio band from Taipei, formed in 2008. The band currently consists of vocalist/bassist Tze-hao Haung (Black Tze), guitarist Yen-chieh Lien (AGUN), and drummer Ming-yen Lee. Guntzepaula is mostly known for its high technical skills and the bassist’s slap technique. Musical style The music of Guntzepaula is more experimental and progressive with harsher and dissonant sounds; however, their unique approach to explore creative sparks related to music structure makes the audience have more fun when listening to their work. Songs were written during jam sessions, most songs and lyrics are inspired with social and political issues, to explore the darkness in human relationships. History Formation and early years Guntzepaula originally formed in 2008 with Tze-hao Haung, guitarist Yen-chieh Lien, drummer Pao-lin Chen (Paul) and saxophonist Jimmy Lu. Jimmy Lu left the band the same year. 2014-2015 HUOZHONG (debut album) HUOZHONG means to cast spell on people, and to spread rumors to confuse people. Songs from this album are inspired with stories from the news or undefined rumors. One of the hit song“Dr. Chen”is about Chen Wen-chen’s unsolved death in 1981. Dr Chen was an assistant professor of mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University, he was detained and interrogated by police for twelve hours, and his body was found on the campus of National Taiwan University the next day. This album was nominated for six Golden Indie Awards and won Best Rock Album and Best Musician of the year. 2016-2017 BLACK LOTUS BLACK LOTUS It was released on June 1, 2016 in Taiwan. It’s still experimental with three instrumental songs, more focus on the band’s skills and techniques. This album was nominated for two Golden Indie Awards, Best Rock Album and Best Musician of the year. However, drummer Pao- lin left the band due to personal reasons after the release tour. The band stopped performing for a period of time, until Ming-yen Lee joined in 2017 and have brought different influence to the band. 2018-present ESCAPISM (EP) Three years after BLACK LOTUS, the new Guntzepaula finally released new EP “ESCAPISM” with three songs in the end of 2019.

He was a cavalry commander of Umayyad Caliph Marwan II and later the leader of a rebellion against the Abbasid Caliphate in Syria which aimed to reestablish the Umayyad Caliphate in 750. Biography Abu al-Ward belonged to the Banu 'Amir ibn Sa'sa' tribe and was a grandson of the chief, Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi, who had rebelled against the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (r. 685–705). During the Third Fitna, a series of civil wars and uprisings against the Umayyad Caliphate, Abu al-Ward became a strong supporter of Caliph Marwan II (r. 744–750). He was appointed the governor of the Jund Qinnasrin district (in modern northern Syria). In 745 Abu al-Ward was dispatched to the Ghouta oasis near Damascus to aid the governor of Jund Dimashq (Damascus), Zamil ibn Amr and the city's residents counter a siege by Ghouta's inhabitants, led by Yazid ibn Khalid al-Qasri. Later in 745, Marwan dispatched Abu al-Ward with a large army to suppress a revolt in Jund Filastin (Palestine) by Thabit ibn Nu'aym, the commander of the Umayyad army in Palestine. Thabit's army reached Tiberias, the capital of Jund al-Urdunn (the Military district of Jordan), which they besieged. As Abu al-Ward departed Damascus on his way to Tiberias, word of his approach spurred the inhabitants of Tiberias, led by governor Walid ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Marwan, a nephew of the deceased Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik, to break Thabit's siege, oust his army from the vicinity and capture his camp. Abu al-Ward arrived later and pursued Thabit, who had withdrawn to Palestine and assembled his kinsmen and rallied his army. In the ensuing battle, Abu al-Ward defeated Thabit's forces, prompting Thabit to flee once more. Three of his sons, Nu'aym, Imran and Bakr, were wounded and captured by Abu al-Ward. They were sent to Marwan who had them treated for their wounds. Thabit was eventually captured and sent to Marwan, who had him and his sons' limbs chopped off and their bodies hung on the gate of the Umayyad Mosque. Revolt against Abbasids In early 750, following the Abbasids' rout of Marwan's army at the Battle of Zab, Abu al-Ward surrendered to the newly appointed Abbasid governor of Bilad al-Sham (Syria), Abdallah ibn Ali. By surrendering he was able to secure a position for himself and his Qaysi confederation in the Abbasid army. Despite declaring his allegiance to the Abbasids, Abu al-Ward defected and took up the cause of the Umayyads, with whom he had ties of loyalty and kinship. Abu al-Ward made his decision after hearing that the Abbasid army's Khorasani contingent at Balis had allegedly insulted the descendants of Maslama and assaulted their women. He assembled an army of his Qaysi loyalists and kinsmen and attacked the Khorasani officer who was headquartered in Maslama's old fort near Balis, raising the white flag of the Umayyads over the fort and instructed his loyalists at Qinnasrin near Aleppo to raise the Umayyads' flag. Abu al-Ward was soon joined by an Umayyad family member, Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani and his Yamani loyalists. Abu al-Ward assumed command over the revolt's military operations, while Abu Muhammad assumed its political leadership. Abu al-Ward's unification of the Qaysi and Yamani tribal groups, who were traditional rivals, together with Abu Muhammad's cultivated image as a messianic Islamic figure, represented a powerful combination but the revolt was suppressed relatively quickly. After Abu al-Ward's forces defeated Abbasid troops near Qinnasrin, the Abbasid army intercepted his army in the vicinity of Homs.Cobb 2001, p. 48. Abu al-Ward was killed along with 500 of his kinsmen and Qaysi soldiers. The Abbasids proceeded to defeat the rebels at Palmyra and Abu Muhammad fled Syria.

The episode was written by Matthew Negrete and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis. The episode focuses on the survivors fleeing and finding shelter from the gargantuan swarm of walkers that have invaded the Alexandria Safe-Zone. Plot The church tower smashes three panels of the wall, and everyone scrambles for whatever shelter they can find as hundreds of walkers pour inside Alexandria. Eugene (Josh McDermitt) finds a walkie-talkie on the ground and yells \\"Help!\\" into it, before being rescued by Tara (Alanna Masterson) and Rosita (Christian Serratos). Maggie (Lauren Cohan) is forced up the ladder to a lookout post and lies back on the platform, trapped but out of sight from the walkers that surround the lookout post. The home of Jessie (Alexandra Breckenridge) hosts a group of Rick (Andrew Lincoln), Carl (Chandler Riggs), Judith, Michonne (Danai Gurira), Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam), Deanna (Tovah Feldshuh), and her own sons Ron (Austin Abrams) and Sam (Major Dodson). They discover Deanna was bitten while saving Rick. Later, Carl checks on a distressed Ron who blames Rick for what's happening and lashes out at Carl, breaking a garage window and drawing the attention of walkers. Rick breaks down the interior garage door to get the boys out as the walkers enter; Carl covers for Ron but confiscates Ron's handgun. Meanwhile, Carol (Melissa McBride) runs with Morgan (Lennie James) to take shelter in Morgan's house. Carol feigns a concussion in order to have Morgan drop his guard, and she attacks him and breaks into the basement. Denise has been locked down there treating the captured Wolf (Benedict Samuel). Carol bursts in and threatens the Wolf with a knife, but Morgan interposes himself between them. They fight and Morgan defeats her but he is then blindsided by the Wolf. Eugene picks the interior door lock of a garage to gain entry to the attached home. He, Tara, and Rosita end up walking in on the Wolf who holds Carol's knife to Denise's throat, taking her hostage. They surrender their weapons to him, and the Wolf escapes with Denise. Outside the wall, Glenn (Steven Yeun) convinces Enid (Katelyn Nacon) to enter Alexandria and help the others. They climb the wall opposite the breach and spot Maggie trapped atop a lookout post. The damage Ron had caused in the garage allows the walkers to break through into Jessie's house, forcing everyone to retreat to the second floor. Knowing they will soon be overrun, Rick decides to make a desperate attempt at escape: he kills and guts two walkers, hoping they can camouflage themselves with their insides and pass through the herd. They slowly make it to the porch while Deanna, left behind, kills several walkers before letting them kill her off-screen. Holding hands to stay together, the group enters the walker-infested street, quiet but for a frightened Sam who repeatedly calls out for his mother. In a post-credits scene, Daryl, Abraham and Sasha are still headed back to Alexandria, but are stopped by a group of bikers blocking the road. One of the bikers tells them to give up all their supplies and their truck, to which, Daryl asks, \\"Why should we?\\". The biker then claims, \\"Your property, now belongs to Negan\\". Reception The episode marks the death of Deanna Monroe played by Tovah Feldshuh. Critical reception \\"Start to Finish\\" received poor reviews from critics. The episode received a 36% rating with an average score of 6.23 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The critics' consensus reads: \\"\\"Start to Finish\\" fails to live up to The Walking Deads potential with a midseason finale that is both dull and frustrating.\\" According to Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Start to Finish\\" was the worst reviewed episode of the series until it was surpassed by the eight season episode \\"The King, the Widow, and Rick\\". Matt Fowler of IGN gave it a 7.3 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict: \\"\\"Start to Finish\\" gets points for keeping Alexandria around and in the mix, but loses a bunch for dropping us right as things started to get exciting. Especially since the rest of the episode was filled with conflicts we hoped we wouldn't have to see in the midst of a giant walker invasion (Carl/Ron, Carol/Morgan).\\" Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave it a C+ grade and wrote, \\"Sure, a bunch of cliffhangers sounds like a smart way to close things out for the year, but none of this is promising us the sight of anything new. All we have to look forward to now is clean up work, and while I’m sure the back half of the season won’t just be Rick and the others making their way to the armory, precious little in this episode suggests otherwise. The only scene tonight that sets up a new storyline happened after the credits—happened, in fact, ten minutes after “Start To Finish” had actually ended. But judging this hour on its own terms, it’s full of clumsy, stupid people doing clumsy, stupid things.\\" Ratings The episode received 13.98 million viewers, an increase from the previous episode, which had 13.22 million viewers overall.

It connects Estrella Street in Makati on the south bank of the Pasig River, near the Rockwell Center mixed-use development, to Pantaleon Street in Mandaluyong on the north bank, near the site of the Acqua Private Residences. It is one of three bridges connecting Makati and Mandaluyong, the other two being the Makati–Mandaluyong Bridge connecting Makati Avenue and the Makati Poblacion to Mandaluyong, and the Guadalupe Bridge carrying Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) between the two cities, ultimately serving to help relieve chronic traffic congestion on the two other bridges.  History =Construction Originally announced in 2003 by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) as one of several bridges to be built by October that year, construction of the bridge would not be realized until several years later, when it was ultimately made part of the Bridge Construction and Acceleration Project for Calamity Stricken Areas I (BCAPCSA I) program, a three-year program funded by Austria to help the Philippines build nineteen weather-resistant bridges, building on a similar program executed by the Austrian and Philippine governments between 2001 and 2005. Austrian firm Waagner-Biro provided the modular steel components for the bridge, while actual construction work was performed by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The ₱303.655 million bridge was inaugurated on February 12, 2011 by Vice President Jejomar Binay along with the mayors of Makati and Mandaluyong (Jejomar Binay, Jr. and Benjamin Abalos, Jr. respectively), DPWH Secretary Rogelio Singson, and Austrian ambassador to the Philippines Wilhelm Donko. Expansion In June 2017, DPWH Secretary Mark Villar announced the expansion of the Estrella–Pantaleon Bridge. The new bridge, to be built using Chinese funds, would have 4 lanes and will be a 560-meter Twin Spine steel box girder bridge with concrete deck slabs. It will utilize the existing approaches while modifying the abutment and piers to accommodate the new bridge superstructure. The bridge was briefly closed in September 2018 preparation of expansion works but was shortly reopened due to the anticipated heavy traffic situation due to the holiday season. Plans for expansion works were moved to January 2019. The closure of the bridge started on January 19, 2019. Traffic regulation In September 2015, Cabinet Secretary Jose Rene Almendras announced that the government was looking into implementing a one- way traffic scheme on the Estrella–Pantaleon and Makati–Mandaluyong Bridges.

Biography  Modern was born in Pressburg, Kingdom of Hungary (today Bratislava, Slovakia) on December 26, 1819 (8 Tevet 5580) and was circumcised by that city's rabbi, the famed Chatam Sofer. Modern was a child prodigy, and by the age of eight was attending the Chatam Sofer's lectures - sitting on the great master's lap as his beloved student. As a teenager, his knowledge of the Gemora was so thorough that he could state how many times the name of the sage Rava appeared on each page of Tractate Bava Batra (the longest Talmudic tractate). At the age of 18, Modern decided to travel to a yeshiva where he was not known, and he set out for Ungvár (today Uzhgorod, Ukraine) to study in the yeshiva of Rabbi Meir Asch. Arriving there, and finding that Rabbi Asch was not at home, Modern decided to visit the great chassidic rebbe, Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum (the \\"Yismach Moshe\\") in nearby Sátoraljaújhely (Ujhel). Rabbi Teitelbaum was impressed with the young Modern and proposed him as a husband for Chaya Rachel Kahana, the daughter of Rabbi Shmuel Kahana, one of the leading citizens of the town of Máramarossziget (today Sighetu Marmației, Romania). Modern and Chaya Rachel Kahana were married that year in 1837. Modern lived the rest of his life in Máramarossziget devoted entirely to Torah study and the performance of acts of kindness (chessed). In particular, he was known for visiting the sick, often spending entire nights by their bedsides. At the same time, he declined all offers of rabbinic positions and all other honors. Modern is buried in the Kahana family ohel in the Sighet Jewish Cemetery - built into the cemetery wall with a window to the outside so that kohanim can pray at the graves of those buried inside. Modern's great grandson was Rabbi David L. Genuth.

Frish Brandt, president of the gallery, joined in 1985. Fraenkel Gallery has presented more than 350 exhibitions, with a focus on photography and its relation to other arts including painting, drawing, sculpture, and video. The gallery’s mission is to expand the conversation around photography by bringing together work by artists across all media. Fraenkel Gallery’s exhibitions have spanned photography's history while exploring the medium’s role in the evolution of art, highlighting links between early photographic pioneers and multi-disciplinary artists of today. The gallery works to build personal connections in diverse arts communities, and emphasizes its commitment to the pleasures and rewards of viewing art in person. The gallery maintains a robust publishing program, producing more than 66 books and a wide range of posters to date, including titles that accompany specific exhibitions and coincide with anniversaries. History Jeffrey Fraenkel opened Fraenkel Gallery on 11 September 1979 at 55 Grant Avenue, San Francisco. Frish Brandt joined Fraenkel Gallery in 1985, and became a partner in 1989. In 2015, Brandt was named president of the gallery. Fraenkel Gallery’s inaugural exhibition featured 19th-century photographs of California by Carleton Watkins. In the gallery’s first decade, it brought new attention to under-recognized photographs by seldom-exhibited 19th-century artists including Watkins, Timothy O’Sullivan, Anna Atkins, and Eadweard Muybridge. Fraenkel Gallery’s second exhibition featured Lee Friedlander, and the gallery soon began showing work by other significant 20th-century artists, including Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Helen Levitt, Diane Arbus, Robert Adams, Garry Winogrand, and Bruce Conner. Two years after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, Fraenkel Gallery moved to a larger space at 49 Geary Street, one block from their first location. The gallery expanded the range of artworks and media featured in exhibitions and books, and presented solo shows by artists including Nan Goldin, Hiroshi Sugimoto, Sophie Calle, Richard Avedon, Sol LeWitt, Gilbert & George, Jay DeFeo, and Bernd and Hilla Becher, as well as group shows encompassing sculpture, drawing, and mixed media. In the 2000s, Fraenkel Gallery began to feature more artists working outside of photography, and exhibitions during this decade included Edward Hopper & Company, Nothing and Everything: Painting, Photography, Drawing & Sculpture 1896–2006, and Not Exactly Photographs. The gallery also added Katy Grannan, Peter Hujar, Christian Marclay, and Ralph Eugene Meatyard to its roster, and began participating in international art fairs including Art Basel and Paris Photo. In the 2010s, Fraenkel Gallery exhibited an increasingly wider swath of multi- disciplinary work, as well as video, sculpture, paintings, film posters, and record albums. The gallery added younger artists to its roster, including Alec Soth, Richard T. Walker, Wardell Milan, Elisheva Biernoff, and Richard Learoyd, as well as those working in a range of media, such as Janet Cardiff & George Bures Miller and Mel Bochner. The satellite space FraenkelLAB, at 1632 Market Street in San Francisco, ran from 2016 through 2017 with a diverse and experimental program. The inaugural exhibition, Home Improvements, was curated by John Waters, and subsequent exhibitions included the work of Richard T. Waker, David Benjamin Sherry, Sophie Calle, Katy Grannan, Alec Soth and others.

In some cases, these laws may also restrict the ability of physicians to counsel their patients about gun safety. The term was first used to describe the \\"Firearm Owners' Privacy Act,\\" a law that was supported by the National Rifle Association and passed in Florida in 2011, which prohibited doctors from “making written inquiry or asking questions concerning the ownership of a firearm or ammunition by the patient or by a family member of the patient.” The law passed in Florida was later challenged by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and was blocked in 2012 when judge Marcia G. Cooke, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, issued an injunction against its implementation. In 2014, Cooke's decision was reversed by a three judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled to uphold the law. The plaintiffs petitioned the court to be heard by the full panel of judges. In 2017, the court found the law to violate physicians' 1st Amendment Rights. Since 2011, twelve other states besides Florida have introduced similar laws, and although Florida's is the most restrictive in the country, similar (albeit watered-down) laws have been enacted in Minnesota, Missouri and Montana. Reactions A 2012 \\"sounding board\\" article in The New England Journal of Medicine criticized Florida's gag law for the same reason Cooke issued an injunction against it, which is that, as Cooke said, “The State, through this law, inserts itself in the doctor–patient relationship, prohibiting and burdening speech necessary to the proper practice of preventive medicine, thereby preventing patients from receiving truthful, non- misleading information.\\" Medical organizations that are opposed to these laws include the American Medical Association, as well as the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Emergency Physicians, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Physicians, American College of Surgeons, American Psychiatric Association, and the American Public Health Association. These eight organizations (not including the AMA) released a joint statement in 2015 which stated that \\"our organizations oppose state and federal mandates that interfere with physician free speech and the patient–physician relationship, including laws that forbid physicians to discuss a patient's gun ownership.\\" References Firearm laws Medical law Social problems in medicine ","title":"Physician gag law"},{"id":"48560389","text":"James Henderson Kyle (29 May 1879 - 11 January 1919) was an Australian cricketer.

She was also one of the ships that assisted with sending out survivors names following the 1912 disaster.  Construction  Minnewaska was constructed in 1908 at the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast, United Kingdom. She was launched on 12 November 1908 and completed in 1909. The ship was long, with a beam of and a depth of . The ship was assessed at . She had 2 quadruple expansion engines driving a two screw propellers and the engine was rated at 1,222 nhp. She had five sister ships:   Accidents  In her career as an ocean liner and transport ship, Minnewaska had a few accidents. In late April 1911, 19-year-old seaman J. W. Browning fell overboard when his lifeline broke while he was working on the lifeboats. According to the New York Times he fell 18 meters from the speeding liner and had to swim desperately in his sea boots to avoid being drawn into her screws. Within a few seconds after the alarm Minnewaska had cut a wide circle to port and was heading back over her course. A boat under the command of Chief Officer James Grant Hutchison was soon lowered and Browning was brought back on board, thirteen minutes after his fall, but without his sea boots. In October 1914, while Minnewaska was taking on cargo in New York when a fire developed in hold number two, where a consignment of sugar had been loaded. The blaze was extinguished only when the hold was flooded. The fire destroyed sugar worth $120,000 and there was some concern that it may have been deliberately set by German agents. But it seems to have been an accident and was blamed by Captain Thomas F. Gates on spontaneous combustion. Minnewaska was not materially damaged and sailed on schedule without any further incident. On 28 April 1915, Minnewaska was present at the Gallipoli landings and was involved in a minor collision with SS Derfflinger off ANZAC Cove.  World War I  Minnewaska had made 66 voyages from London to New York between May 1909 and January 1915. She was requisitioned by the British Government for service in World War I as a troopship. She sailed the Avonmouth - Alexandria route during this period in her career. She was defensively armed with a gun mounted on her stern and made five voyages ferrying troops and artillery to the Dardanelles. She had some narrow escapes involving submarines.  Sinking  On 29 November 1916, while she was travelling from Alexandria, Egypt to Saloniki with 1,600 troops. She struck a floating mine southeast of Dentero Point, Suda Bay, Crete which tore a large hole in the hull. The ship took on a rapidly increasing list and threatened to capsize after the explosion but Captain Gates, who ordered everyone into their life belts and had lifeboats and rafts at the ready, managed to keep control of the ship and decided to steam at full speed to the nearby shore. He successfully ran her aground 46 meters west of Cape Deutero at the entrance to Suda Bay where she came to rest. It took about two hours to evacuate the ship and the men were rescued without loss by the trawler Danestone, the drifters Principal, Trustful and Deveronside, and the destroyer HMS Grampus. Due to his prompt action, there was no loss of life from the 1800 soldiers and 200 sailors on board at the time. He was subsequently awarded the Order of the British Empire for his actions.  Aftermath  Minnewaska′s bottom had been torn away by the mine and she had to be abandoned on the beach where she lay for two years until in 1918, when she was sold to Italian shipbreakers for scrap. She was broken up on site and some parts of the wreck remain on the site to this day.

KortlangWisden 1962, p. 987.The Cricketer, 1961, No. 2, p. 26. (12 March 1880 – 15 February 1961) was an Australian cricketer. He played 17 first-class cricket matches for Victoria between 1910 and 1912, and 15 matches for Wellington in New Zealand between 1922 and 1927. He also played for an Australian XI in 1911 and for a New Zealand XI in 1924. Life and career Bert Kortlang travelled widely around the world, playing cricket wherever he found himself from the 1890s to the 1930s, although the reasons for most of his travels and his means of financing them remain obscure.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, p. 292. Sir Pelham Warner once wrote of him: \\"We hear of him here; we hear of him there; the beggar pops up everywhere.\\" Early life and the Americas Kortlang was a sturdily-built man of middle height, a sound and patient batsman, difficult to dismiss, who could also hit hard and use his strong wrists to pull short balls to the boundary. After playing club cricket in his native Melbourne, he left home at the age of 15 after a disagreement with his father, who had chastised him for playing cricket for his school when he should have been helping at home. He went to Sydney, where he played three seasons for Balmain in the late 1890s. He then left for the Americas, where during his travels he took part in an impromptu game of cricket on the frozen sea during the Klondike Gold Rush. He played cricket in New York City then went to Bermuda, representing the Hamilton Cricket Club on their tour of the eastern United States in 1905. He was also a skilled billiards player, winning the New York amateur championship in January 1906. He spent some time in California, and was living in San Francisco at the time of the earthquake in April 1906. He lost his belongings when his hotel, the Winchester, was destroyed, but with the help of friends he was able to return to New York. Back to Australia Kortlang returned to Australia in 1909. An Australian newspaper said of him at the time: \\"He might well be described as an Americanised Australian, for he has the accent, the ease, the mental alertness, and, one may say, the entire atmosphere of the American who is a good sport.\\" Living in Melbourne, he gained Sheffield Shield selection for Victoria in 1909-10, although he was most successful against the non-Shield teams Queensland and Western Australia, scoring centuries. In one of the matches against Western Australia he scored 197, and with Colin McKenzie, who scored 211, added 358 for the second wicket, an Australian second-wicket record. He was the leading scorer in the Australian first-class season, with 656 runs at an average of 131.20. In 1910-11, the national selectors gave him a trial in an Australian XI against the touring South Africans, but he was unable to break into the Test team. In Sydney in March 1912 he rescued the daughter of the New South Wales state politician Dr Richard Arthur from drowning in heavy surf off Manly. Kortlang himself was almost drowned, but was rescued by the lifesaver on duty and resuscitated. Return to the Americas and World War I Kortlang went to Argentina in 1912, playing in the series of matches between North and South, representing South in 1912 and 1913. In 1914 he was employed by the Spalding sports equipment company, which sent him on a business trip to Central America. In April 1916 an Australian newspaper reported that he was in Barbados and playing cricket there. It went on: \\"Kortlang, who is known as 'The Globe Trotter Cricketer', has played cricket in Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, Chili, Argentine, Singapore, Bermuda, Barbadoes, West Indies, Canada and the United States.\\" During World War I he fought in Europe with the 6th Field Company of Canadian Engineers with the rank of sergeant-major. After being gassed he was invalided back to Canada. In early 1918 he was conducting a party of recruits on a ship from Los Angeles to Victoria, British Columbia, when he discovered two German agents aboard who were planning to incite the recruits to desert. With the help of some colleagues Kortlang arrested the two men, who were subsequently tried and imprisoned for espionage. Although the effects of the poison gas stayed with him for years, he was able to continue playing cricket. In 1919, playing for Manor Field, he was the leading batsman in the Halifax Cup competition in the eastern United States for the third time, scoring 601 runs at an average of 66.77, with three centuries. New Zealand Kortlang returned to New Zealand in September 1922, \\"to represent a motor firm of New York\\". He told a Dunedin newspaper, \\"I may play in Wellington or Christchurch, as that is where my business will keep me most.\\" By this stage he had added Britain, South Africa, India, Fiji, Ceylon and China to the list of countries in which he had played cricket. He began playing club cricket in Wellington, and after only one match he was selected to play for the provincial side. At the age of 42 he played his first first-class match since 1912 when he made his debut for Wellington in the first match of the 1922-23 Plunket Shield season. He scored a century in the first innings, the former New Zealand captain Tom Cobcroft reporting: \\"There was hardly a stroke in the repertoire of any batsman that was not cleverly used by him. His driving, late cutting, glancing, hooking and pulling all were made in the most artistic style.\\" He was the highest scorer in the Plunket Shield that season, with 288 runs at an average of 72.00. In the 1923-24 Plunket Shield he scored 318 runs at an average of 53.00, and Wellington won the trophy by winning all three of their matches. He and Wiri Baker added 227 for the second wicket in the match against Otago, a Plunket Shield second-wicket record that stood for many years. Later in the season a strong New South Wales team toured New Zealand, including in their itinerary two matches against the full New Zealand team. Kortlang played in the second match and was New Zealand's highest scorer with 39 (in 132 minutes, of New Zealand's first-innings total of 89) and 14 in an innings defeat.Don Neely & Richard Payne, Men in White: The History of New Zealand International Cricket, 1894–1985, Moa, Auckland, 1986, p. 66. Wellington won the Plunket Shield again in 1925-26, Kortlang scoring 305 runs at 76.25. Most of his runs came from an innings of 214 not out in the final match against Auckland. Wellington needed to win the match to secure the championship, and won by 512 runs. He played his last first-class match in the 1926-27 season. He then spent three years in Canada until 1930, still playing cricket. He reported on the Australian tour of England in 1930 for the Toronto Star. Back to Australia again Bert Kortlang in 1935 After another visit to Bermuda, Kortlang returned to live in Australia. He had a business in Manly in 1934, and was coaching there. He finally settled in Perth in 1935, when The West Australian wrote: \\"B. J. Kortlang looks, and is, a wanderer tired of wandering. He is Canadian in accent, American in mannerism, and Australian at heart.\\" In 1935 he was one of the founders of baseball in Western Australia, after advocating the sport to help the local cricketers develop their fielding skills. He persuaded his former employer, the Spalding company, to donate two sets of baseball gear to get the project going. Participation was so enthusiastic that Western Australia was able to compete in the Claxton Shield interstate competition for the first time in 1937.Joe Clark, A History of Australian Baseball, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, 2003, pp. 53–54. He came to be regarded as the father of Western Australian baseball. Kortlang and his wife Berna had a daughter, Jan, who was born in Perth in January 1937. Don Bradman, a good friend of Kortlang, was Jan's godfather. Kortlang died suddenly in Perth in February 1961, aged 80.

The pitch is most often used as a measurement of font size of typewriters as well as printers. The relation between pitch font size and typographic font size (points) is usually inverse: a 12-pitch typewriter font is equal in height to 10-point typographic font, while a 10 pitch- typewriter font is equal in height to 12-point typographic font. However, this relation is not obligatory, e.g., a 12-pitch font with a smaller x-height can have the same body height as a 10-pitch font, thus creating a text with increased line spacing. The most widespread fonts in typewriters are 10 and 12 pitch, called pica and elite, respectively. There may be other font styles with various width: condensed or compressed (17–20 cpi), italic or bold (10 pitch), enlarged (5–8 cpi), and so on. In typography a similar concept is applied in the process of copyfitting: a number of characters per pica (cpp), a pica being a sixth of an inch. As books are most often printed with proportional fonts, cpp of a given font is usually a fractional number. For example, an 11-point font (like Helvetica) may have 2.4 cpp, thus a 5-inch (30-pica) line of a usual octavo-sized (6×8 in) book page would contain around 72 characters (including spaces).

Hamilton. Novels= Greg Mandel trilogy (1993–1995)  #Mindstar Rising (1993), #A Quantum Murder (1994), #The Nano Flower (1995), Confederation universe (1996–2000) # The Reality Dysfunction (1996, published in two volumes in the US: Emergence and Expansion), # The Neutronium Alchemist (1997, published in two volumes in the US: Consolidation and Conflict), # The Naked God (1999, published in two volumes in paperback in the US: Flight and Faith; the US hardback was one volume), * The Confederation Handbook (2000, a guide in non- fiction style to the universe of the Night's Dawn trilogy), After the Greg Mandel novels, Hamilton wrote a space opera in three volumes, known collectively as The Night's Dawn Trilogy. The three books are each well over a thousand pages long and are not standalone novels, totalling 1.2 million words. The trilogy is set in a universe with a wealth of worlds and artificial orbiting colonies. The plot is centered on the souls of the dead coming back from a hellish \\"beyond\\" to possess the living, and the latter fighting back. It was followed by a companion to the series, The Confederation Handbook, an informational book containing data about the universe of the Night's Dawn trilogy. Hamilton re-set several earlier short stories set in the Confederation timeline, published as the collection A Second Chance at Eden (see \\"Short story collections\\" below), including the newly written title novella. Commonwealth universe (2002–present)Misspent Youth= Misspent Youth is much shorter than either the Night's Dawn novels or Fallen Dragon, and again depicts a near-future version of Britain (but different from that in the Greg Mandel trilogy). This was his least well received book critically. The author Graham Joyce has a cameo part in the book. Misspent Youth is placed in the same universe as the Commonwealth Saga, though it is not integral to the storyline of those novels. Much of the technology used in those novels (rejuvenation and low-cost/high-capacity memory storage) is established within this book. =Commonwealth Saga= # Pandora's Star (2004), # Judas Unchained (2005), The Commonwealth Saga is published in two halves, Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained. Set approximately 300 years later in the same universe as Misspent Youth, it explores the social effects of the almost complete elimination of the experience of death following widespread use of the rejuvenation technique described in Misspent Youth. In somewhat similar style to Night's Dawn, Hamilton also outlines, in detail, a universe with a small number of distinct alien species interacting essentially peacefully and who suddenly become faced with an increasingly ominous external threat. =Void Trilogy= # The Dreaming Void (2007), # The Temporal Void (2008), # The Evolutionary Void (2010), Set in the same universe as the Commonwealth Saga, the Void Trilogy is set 1200 years after the end of Judas Unchained. The release date for the first book, The Dreaming Void, was 3 August 2007. A time line that links the Commonwealth Saga with the Void Trilogy, filling in the 1200-year gap, has been written by Hamilton. The second book in the trilogy, The Temporal Void, was published in 2008. The third book in the trilogy, The Evolutionary Void, was published in August 2010. =The Chronicle of the Fallers= # The Abyss Beyond Dreams (2014), # Night Without Stars (2016), (UK), (US) Hamilton announced in 2011 that he is developing a new trilogy. He later cut this down to two books titled The Chronicle of the Fallers. It is a return to his Commonwealth Universe, set in the same time-frame as the Void Trilogy, and tells the story of Nigel Sheldon and what happened when he broke into the Void. On 19 March, both the cover art and release date for the first book, The Abyss Beyond Dreams, was unveiled. The book was published on 21 October 2014. The second book, Night Without Stars, was published 22 September 2016. The Queen of Dreams (2014–present) # The Secret Throne (2014), # The Hunting of the Princes (2016) # A Voyage Through Air (10 August 2017) A children's fantasy series also known as Book of the Realms. Taggie and Jemima are summer holidaying on their dad's farm. They know just what to expect—a tumbledown cottage, sunshine and strawberry-picking. But then Jemima sees a white squirrel wearing glasses… And things become even more extraordinary when their dad is captured and whisked away to a faerie world. The Salvation sequence (2018–present) * Salvation (2018), * Salvation Lost (2019) * Saints of Salvation (forthcoming in 2020) Hamilton's Salvation sequence involves two concurrent story lines. One is set during the year 2204. In this period humanity has developed near- instantaneous space travel via 'trans-dimensional gates,' and are using them to begin spreading out into the galaxy. As a consequence of this technology, crewed spaceships are unnecessary. When an unknown vessel is found on a recently explored world, a team of specialists are sent out to investigate both the craft and the astonishing contents therein. The other story line is set much farther in the future. It follows a genetically engineered team of special forces designed to confront and destroy an enemy who are following their religious agenda of harvesting all sentient species in the galaxy. Standalone novels * Fallen Dragon (2001), His full-length novel, Fallen Dragon, is in many ways a condensation of the ideas and styles (and even characters) of the Night's Dawn trilogy, if rather darker in tone. The stand- alone book describes a bleak corporatocratic society dominated by five mega- corporations which wield almost unlimited power. It describes the troubled military campaign by one of these companies to \\"realise assets\\" from a minor colony, through the eyes of a veteran mercenary. One of the more interesting aspects of the book was its unconventional description of a spacefaring society which has developed interstellar travel but only at vast expense, putting it out of the reach of many people and a one-way trip for most of the rest. * Great North Road (2012), Set in Newcastle upon Tyne in 2143, the Great North Road is a futuristic murder-mystery.

The school can trace its ancestry to the 1600s, and has changed name several times throughout its existence. Its current building was completed in 1910, and it has remained there ever since. History Östermalms läroverk in 1910 The current Östra Real school has its origins in the very primitive school that was started within the St Jakobs church congregation in 1672. Unfortunately most records from this period are missing. The oldest record that remains dates to the 12 May 1731, and is a matriculation record of the students at the school. The school has existed under various names, including Ladugårdslands lägre elementarläroverk (from 1857), and Högre allmänna läroverket å Östermalm between 1903-1906 and 1926–1971. In the time period 1906-1926 the name was Högre realläroverket å Östermalm, with the short form of Östra Real. After 1971 the school was called Östermalms Gymnasium and since 1990 it has been known by its current name. Despite the many different names, in common usage the school has been referred to as Östra Real for most of these periods. Today the school has over 1170 students and about 100 employees, of which 70 are teachers. It offers the national study programmes in Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Economy. The school has figured in popular culture, being referenced in books by Peter Mosskin, Per Wästberg, Kar de Mumma and Gustav Öberg. The first scenes in the 2003 film Ondskan are filmed at Östra Real. Several members of the Swedish Academy have been students at the school. Building The current building of Östra Real was completed in 1910, but it was not officially inaugurated until January 1911 by King Gustav V. The building was designed by Ragnar Östberg in the National Romantic style. The inside of the building has undergone many renovations, with many of the original characteristic features being changed. The most thorough renovation was started in 1976. In the music hall there are murals by Georg Pauli and the decoration in the staff room is by the artist Filip Månsson. The school also has sculptures by Carl Eldh and Carl Milles and frescos by Axel Törneman and Prince Eugen.

It is part of one of Sweden's largest student union events Läroverksfejden, an academic and sports competition between Södra Latin, Kungsholmens Gymnasium and Norra Real. The student union at Östra Real is characterised by a coat of arms, with the letters 'Ö' and 'R' as well as two lions as the charges in the escutcheon.

The battalion moved through several locations in the United States until leaving for England on May 13, 1944 and arriving in England on May 25, 1944. The 789th was directly involved in four campaigns: Northern France, Antwerp, Ardennes, and the Rhineland. Organization The 789th AAA Battalion was composed of four batteries (A, B, C, and D) which consisted of roughly 200-250 individuals. Each battery contained ten 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft artillery guns. The 789th AAA Battalion also contained a headquarters, or HQ, battery which managed the administrative responsibilities of the battalion. Training After completing basic training, members of the 789th AAA Battalion were sent to Fort Stewart in Liberty County, Georgia for their training as an artillery unit. The majority of this training focused on developing battalion members' skills and understandings of operations as an anti-aircraft artillery battalion. Following the 789th AAA Battalion's training at Fort Stewart, the battalion moved to Fort Pickett in Blackstone, Virginia. This training at Fort Pickett differed significantly from the training at Fort Stewart and instead focused on developing proficiency and understanding of basic infantry tactics and operations. While the 789th AAA Battalion was not intended to act as an infantry unit, anti-aircraft artillery units could be attached to a variety of other units, including infantry units. Deployment to England The 789th AAA Battalion departed for England on May 13, 1944 and arrived on May 23, 1944. While in England, the 789th AAA Battalion was honored with the assignment of providing the air-aircraft protection for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in Bushy Park, London. In addition to protecting the SHAEF in Bushy Park, the 789th AAA Battalion also spent time in Poole Harbour, where they were one of several AAA battalions responsible for protecting the invasion force from German V-1 flying bombs. Northern France The 789th AAA Battalion remained in England for several months before departing for Northern France in the late-summer of 1944. After moving to mainland Europe, the 789th AAA Battalion provided protection for allied forces which were stationed in Northern France. During this time, members of the 789th AAA Battalion earned their first campaign star and were awarded credit for the Northern France Campaign. Antwerp X After the Allies had secured France and were advancing Westward, the need to efficiently re-supply the forces was becoming more dire. The Port of Antwerp was in a perfect position to allow the Allies to quickly get supplies to the front lines. Knowing the importance that the port played, the Germans began a fierce bombing campaign of the entire city of Antwerp in an attempt to destroy the port. The Allies rushed the 50th AAA Group, which included the 789th AAA Battalion, to Antwerp in an effort to protect the city from the German buzz bombs. Beginning in October 1944, Brigadier General Clare H. Armstrong commanded the Antwerp X campaign which sought to protect Antwerp and its residents. The 789th AAA Battalion was one of the first units to set up its guns on Antwerp's outskirts in the city of Lier, Belgium. The 789th AAA Battalion held this position from late-October through mid-December. During this time, the 789th shot down more than 250 buzz bombs and its members earned their second campaign star for the Antwerp Campaign, or unofficially Antwerp X. The launch of the German surprise attack in the Ardennes, or the Battle of the Bulge, temporarily drew the 789th AAA Battalion away from Antwerp.

Green Bibliography Most of Green's works take place within the same fictional realm, encompassing multiple realities which characters inhabit, or in some cases move between. Although cross-series use of characters or settings is frequently limited to passing mentions or brief cameo appearances, a number of Green's stories have prominently featured characters from other works in a manner that is significant to the plot. Despite this, Green's works can, with some exceptions, be separated into several distinct series and standalone novels. Series Deathstalker = # Deathstalker (London, Gollancz 1995). # Deathstalker Rebellion (London, Vista 1996). # Deathstalker War (London, Gollancz/Vista 1997). # Deathstalker Honour (London, Gollancz/Vista 1998). # Deathstalker Destiny (London, Orion/Millennium 1999). # Deathstalker Legacy (2003) # Deathstalker Return (New York, Roc 2004). # Deathstalker Coda (2005) The Deathstalker series is partly a parody of the usual space opera of the 1950s, told with sovereign disregard of the rules of probability, while being at the same time extremely bloodthirsty. = Forest Kingdom = # Blue Moon Rising. New York, Penguin/Roc, May 1991; London, Gollancz, September 1991. # Blood and Honour. London, Gollancz, June 1992; as Blood and Honor, New York, Penguin/Roc, May 1993. # Down Among the Dead Men. London, Gollancz, September 1993; New York, Penguin/Roc, December 1993. # Beyond the Blue Moon (2000). # Once in a Blue Moon. Roc, USA, January 2014; . This series focuses on characters and events in the northern areas of the Low Kingdoms, the same kingdom which encompasses the southern city of Haven (the setting of the Hawk and Fisher series). It largely deals with the events and aftermath of the Demon War, focusing on multiple characters and plot arcs. The series serves as a companion to the Hawk and Fisher series, Blue Moon Rising taking place before the first Hawk and Fisher novel, and Beyond the Blue Moon being a followup to both Blue Moon Rising and the Hawk and Fisher series as a whole. = Ghost Finders = # Ghost of a Chance (August 2010) # Ghost of a Smile (August 2011) # Ghost of a Dream (August 2012) # Spirits From Beyond (August 2013) # Voices From Beyond (26 August 2014) # Forces From Beyond (25 August 2015) The Ghostfinders of the Carnacki Institute are here to \\"Do Something\\" about ghosts, and live by the motto \\"We don't take any shit from the Hereafter\\". This series follows a team of three Ghostfinders: the leader, JC Chance, who was touched by something from Outside in a recent case and is still trying to determine what all that means; Melody Chambers, girl geek and computer expert; and \\"Happy\\" Jack Palmer, Class Eleven telepath and official gloomy bugger. They are joined by JC's ghost girlfriend, Kim. JC's motley crew is now considered an \\"A Team\\" at the Institute, and are slowly putting pieces together of a greater threat facing humanity. The Ghost Finders series was ended when the sixth book was released in August 2015. The Ghostfinders series takes place in the same world as the Nightside, Secret Histories, and various other Simon R. Green novels, with frequent references to characters and places between them. = Hawk and Fisher = # Hawk & Fisher.

New York, Penguin/Roc, Nov 1999; as Fear and Loathing in Haven (omnibus; contains Vengeance for a Lonely Man, Guard Against Dishonour, and Two Kings in Haven), London, Millennium, Apr 2000. Hawk and Fisher are a husband and wife team on the City Guard, an order which functions rather like a modern police force in a fantasy world of mixed Medieval, Renaissance, and Industrial Revolution stylings. They live in the port city of Haven, a city-state so corrupt that they can justly make the claim of being the only guards who have never taken a bribe or looked the other direction. They deal with everything from pickpockets to wide-scale destructive magic. = Ishmael Jones = # The Dark Side of the Road (May 2015) # Dead Man Walking (May 2016) # Very Important Corpses: An Ishmael Jones mystery (March 2017) # Death Shall Come (September 2017) # Into the Thinnest of Air (March 2018) # Murder in the Dark (August 2018) # Till Sudden Death Do Us Part (August 2019) # Night Train to Murder (January 2020) # The House on Widows Hill (July 2020) Ishmael Jones is someone who cannot afford to be noticed, someone who lives under the radar, who drives on the dark side of the road. He is employed to search out secrets, investigate mysteries and shine a light in dark places. Sometimes he kills people. = Nightside = # Something from the Nightside (New York, Ace, 2003) # Agents of Light and Darkness (New York, Ace, 2003) # Nightingale's Lament (New York, Ace, 2004) # Hex and the City (New York, Ace, 2005) # Paths Not Taken (New York, Ace, September 2005) # Sharper than a Serpent's Tooth (Ace, 28 February 2006) # Hell to Pay (Ace, 27 December 2006) # The Unnatural Inquirer (Ace, 2 January 2008) # Just Another Judgement Day (Ace, 6 January 2009) # The Good, the Bad, and the Uncanny (Ace, 5 January 2010) # A Hard Day's Knight (Ace, 4 January 2011) # The Bride Wore Black Leather (Ace, 3 January 2012), * A Walk on the Nightside (Ace, 5 September 2006) (A collection of the first three Nightside novels.) A series of fantasy novels centering on the protagonist, John Taylor, and based in the \\"Nightside\\", a hidden area within London in which magic and advanced technology exist. This series also ties into the Hawk and Fisher series (i.e. mentioning the Street of the Gods, a prominent setting in the second and third novellas, Winner Take All and God Killer). Indeed, Hawk and Fisher appear drinking at Strangefellows Pub in the Nightside as an unnamed but clearly recognizable couple in A Hard Day's Knight, and the Deathstalker series is often referenced: Haceldama, Hadenmen, and the Darkvoid Device are all mentioned in passing. Razor Eddie, Punk God of the Straight Razor, is rumored to have gone to the Street of the Gods to make a deal with some unknown deity for all the evil he had done, and came back changed. The Nightside series was completed when the twelfth book was released in January 2012. = Secret History = # The Man with the Golden Torc (UK: 17 May 2007; US: 5 June 2007) # Daemons Are Forever (US: 3 June 2008) # The Spy Who Haunted Me (UK: 12 April 2009; US: 2 June 2009) # From Hell with Love (US: 1 June 2010) # For Heaven's Eyes Only (US: 7 June 2011) # Live and Let Drood (US: 5 June 2012) # Casino Infernale (US: 4 June 2013) # Property of a Lady Faire (3 June 2014) # From a Drood to a Kill (2 June 2015) # Dr. DOA (US 7 July 2016) # Moonbreaker (6 June 2017) # Night Fall (12 June 2018) This book series was supposed to be a trilogy, but due to the great popularity of the books Green decided to continue with the series, until finally ending it with Night Fall. Being all from the same universe, the Deathstalker series has had a member of the Deathstalker family in the Secret Histories novel. Along with this comes a meeting with John Taylor, a cameo appearance of Walker (both from the Nightside series), and an appearance of the Carnacki Institute's boss (from the Ghost Finders series). = Twilight of the Empire = (Prelude to the Deathstalker series) # Mistworld. New York, Ace, Sep 1992; London, Gollancz, Nov 1992. # Ghostworld. New York, Ace, Mar 1993; London, Gollancz, Sep 1993. # Hellworld. New York, Ace, Sep 1993; revised, London, Gollancz, Dec 1995. # Twilight of the Empire (omnibus; contains Mistworld, Ghostworld, and Hellworld). New York, Penguin/Roc, Aug 1997; as Deathstalker Prelude (with revised version of Hellworld), London, Gollancz/Vista, Nov 1998. Set in the Deathstalker universe. Mistworld tells the tale of the Empire's attack on the free planet of Mistworld, haven of outlaws and rebels, using Typhoid Mary. Ghostworld introduces Captain Silence and his crew as they respond to an emergency on the (supposedly) dead planet of Unseeli. Hellworld finds Captain Hunter and his scouts stranded on a nightmarish planet. All three novellas either introduce characters that later appear in the main Deathstalker epic series, or concern events that are later referred to in the main Deathstalker epic series.  Standalone books  * Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (film novelization) * Shadows Fall The Shadows Fall novel takes place in the same world as the Nightside series and is mentioned as a destination via subway in several of the Nightside novels. Characters mentioned in the Shadows Fall novel have appeared in the Nightside including Father Time, Bruin Bear, and Sea Goat as well as the building Time Tower, which is the residence of Father Time. * Drinking Midnight Wine An audio version of Drinking Midnight Wine was released in 2013, read by English actor Dikran Tulaine. Short stories Green plans to release all his short stories in two separate anthologies. The second will be a collection of Nightside shorts featuring a new novella, and the first anthology will contain his other works, also including a new novella. * \\"Awake, Awake, Ye Northern Winds\\" (1979), Swords Against Darkness V * \\"Soulhunter\\" (1982), Fantasy Macabre 3 * \\"In the Labyrinth\\" (Winter 1983), Fantasy Tales, v6 #12 * \\"Death is a Lady\\" (1997), Dancing with the Dark * \\"Richard Evans - Remembered\\" (January 1998), The Alien Has Landed #5 * \\"Manslayer\\" (2000), Swords Against the Millennium * \\"The Nightside, Needless to Say\\" (October 2004), Powers Of Detection * \\"Razor Eddie’s Big Night Out\\" (July 2006), Cemetery Dance #55 * \\"Lucy, at Christmastime\\" (October 2008), Wolfsbane and Mistletoe * \\"Appetite for Murder\\" (December 2008), Unusual Suspects * \\"The Difference a Day Makes\\" (January 2009), Mean Streets * \\"Some of These Cons Go Way Back\\" (June 2009), Cemetery Dance #60 * \\"Food of the Gods\\" (August 2009), Dark Delicacies III: Haunted * \\"He Said, Laughing\\" (September 2010), Living Dead 2 * \\"Street Wizard\\" (November 2010), The Way of the Wizard * \\"The Spirit of the Thing\\" (March 2011), Those Who Fight Monsters * \\"It's All In the Rendering\\" (August 2011), Home Improvement, Undead Edition * \\"Jesus and Satan Go Jogging in the Desert\\" (September 2011), The Monster's Corner * \\"Hungry Heart\\" (October 2011), Down These Strange Streets * \\"Down and Out in Dead Town\\", 21st Century Dead: A Zombie Anthology (July 2012) * \\"How Do You Feel\\", Hex Appeal (June 2012) * \\"Dorothy Dreams\\", Oz Reimagined: New Tales from the Emerald City and Beyond (February 2013) The first anthology, Tales from the Hidden World, was released on 8 July 2014.

Plot Carol Lambert is a cigarette girl in a posh Florida hotel. A note is delivered to the resort's bandleader, Gene Ritchie, requesting that Carol get a chance to sing. Gene already has a singer, Mona St. Clair, so the note causes resentment and Carol is fired. Mrs. Whitmore, the hotel's owner, likes Carol and rehires her. Meantime, a con artist who calls himself \\"Colonel\\" Morgan turns up and, with partner Billy, begins scamming the hotel's guests. An embarrassed Carol tries to cover for him. Morgan uses his charms to persuade Mrs. Whitmore to let Carol sing. She's a great success, but when an irate Mona reveals that Morgan's a con man who has even promised to deliver a new benefactor for the band, the musicians walk out.

He moved to Washington, D.C. to become a reactor engineer for the United States Atomic Energy Commission. In 1953 he was sent to Livermore, California to develop and test the first thermonuclear weapons. In 1956, he was called back to Washington to work on the NS Savannah as Project Director. Bechtel In 1961, Godwin was hired at Bechtel and moved his family to California. At Bechtel, Godwin held a plethora of positions, starting as an executive engineer, then manager scientific development department from 1962 to 1965, executive assistant to the chairman, Bechtel Group of Companies from 1965 to 1967, manager research and scientific development, corporate planning, executive services, and computer departments from 1967 to 1971, elected vice president Bechtel, Inc., and manager of division operations in the hydro and community facilities division from 1971 to 1973, deputy division manager and division manager from 1974 to 1976, Director Bechtel Group, Inc. from 1976 to 1978, senior vice president from 1978 to 1979, and executive Vice President and member of the executive committee from 1979 to 1980. Among the many accomplishments for which he was responsible at Bechtel was the development of Jubail Industrial City in Saudi Arabia. Richard P. Godwin with President Ronald Reagan Department of Defense When news surfaced that The Pentagon was paying vastly inflated prices for spare parts & everyday items as toilet seats, nails, and hammers. Hewlett-Packard chairman David Packard was tasked by President Ronald Reagan to head a commission to look into the situation. The panel found that there was a big problem. A statute was created by Congress asking for single bureaucrat responsible for what the Pentagon orders. They believed that under a centralized system various chiefs of each branch of the service would lose their authority to decide what weapons systems would be purchased. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan selected Richard Godwin to become the first Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics third-ranking official in the department under Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, also a former Bechtel executive, and Deputy Secretary William Howard Taft IV. Richards simple goal of employing commercial business practices instead of military or bureaucratic ones to improve and simplify acquisitions turned out to be fruitless. A year later he resigned, stating his superiors Weinberger & Taft didn’t give any executive powers beyond being able to “Sign a Paper”. Most of the Packard Commission reforms he pushed were eventually enacted.http://www.whs.mil/library/Key47-04/22.pdf Broadway Godwin was executive producer of two successful Broadway musical revivals: “Crazy For You” (1992), which won a Tony & Olivier Award, and “Kiss Me, Kate” (1999) which won Tonys and Oliviers awards as well.

It involves summons from the governor general on behalf of the monarch and a ceremony based on the same in the United Kingdom, though less elaborate and now evolved to include uniquely Canadian elements. Summons At the same time as the Governor General of Canada drops the writ for a federal election, he or she also issues a royal proclamation summoning parliament—setting the date for the opening of the next parliament following the election (though, the date may be amended by subsequent proclamations, so long as parliament eventually meets as required by the Constitution Act, 1867). These read as follows: A later proclamation gives the precise time for parliament to open: Of the governor general's deputies, only the justices of the supreme court can summon parliament (though they, like the other deputies, may not dissolve it). Opening of parliament Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at the opening of parliament, 14 October 1957. The justices of the supreme court sit at centre, in front of the monarch. The Mace Bearer stands at far right. The Prime Minister (John Diefenbaker) sits to the sovereign's immediate right. Canada has two types of opening for the federal parliament, differentiated by scale: Larger openings, called bench openings, require the seating of the Senate (where the monarch, governor general, or another delegate reads the Throne Speech), which is rearranged to accommodate the number of official guests—the justices of the supreme court, lieutenant- governors, former prime ministers, members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, and members of the diplomatic corps, and any spouses—and the galleries are reserved for other guests. Smaller openings, called desk openings do not require the removal of senators' desks, as guests are limited to the justices of the supreme court, invitees of the governor general and prime minister, and the deans of the diplomatic corps. The Speaker of the Senate establishes the guest list, though the size of the ceremony is determined by the prime minister. The opening of the first session of a parliament takes place over two days (the opening of a subsequent session of the same parliament requires only one day). On the first, routine business is conducted. After such is concluded, the Speaker of the Senate commands the Usher of the Black Rod (usually called simply Black Rod) to summon the members of the House of Commons to the Senate. Once assembled, the speaker addresses the congregation, stating \\"Honourable Members of the Senate, Members of the House of Commons: I have it in command to let you know His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General does not see fit to declare the causes of his [or her] summoning of the present Parliament of Canada, until a Speaker of the House of Commons shall have been chosen, according to law; but tomorrow, [date], at [time], His [or Her] Excellency will declare the causes of his [or her] calling this parliament.\\" The Members of Parliament then return to the commons to elect the speaker for that chamber. The speech itself is delivered the following day. As the Queen's representative, the governor general attends parliament to deliver the Speech From the Throne, although this can and has been done by the sovereign themselves or another representative, for example the Queen gave the Speech from the Throne in 1977. Accompanied by four officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, he or she usually rides in the State Landau, often accompanied by the viceregal consort, between Rideau Hall and Parliament Hill, where the governor general inspects a Canadian Armed Forces guard of honour. Once the viceroy is in the parliament building, the Usher of the Black Rod is again sent to call the members of the House of Commons to the Senate. Upon his or her arrival at the bar of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Commons addresses his counterpart in the Senate, asserting the rights and privileges of the commons and its members. The Speaker of the Senate, on behalf of the governor general, responds that the Crown will \\"recognise and allow their constitutional privileges\\". The governor general then reads the Throne Speech, during which the Senate's mace is held by the Mace Bearer, who stands to the side of the throne. Debate The address is followed by a debate and vote in both houses of parliament. Formally, the motion merely calls on parliament to thank the monarch or viceroy for the speech via an Address in Reply. Until 1897, this was a more detailed message, covering the content of the Throne Speech point by point. Today, in the Senate, takes the form of simply: The debate is, however, often wide-ranging, exploring many aspects of the government's proposed policies, and spread over several days. When the Address in Reply is eventually voted on, the poll is held to constitute a motion of confidence in the government, which, if lost, would result in the end of that government's mandate. This discussion and vote follows a symbolic raising of other matters, designed to highlight the independence of parliament from the Crown; a practice that originated after King Charles I was tried and executed by the Parliament of England. In the Senate, it is Bill S-1, an Act Relating to Railways.

Situated on the southern shore of the Katonga River, Bigo is best described as having two elements. The first consists of a long, irregular ditch and bank alignment with multiple openings that effectively creates an outer boundary by connecting to the Kotanga River in the east and the Kakinga swamp to the west. Toward its eastern end the outer ditch branches further to the east to encompass a nearby crossing of the Katonga River. The second element consists of a central, interconnected group of four irregularly shaped ditch and bank enclosures that are connected to the Katonga River by a single ditch. Three mounds are associated with the central enclosures; two within and one immediately to the west. When combined, the Bigo earthworks extend for more than 10 kilometers. Resulting from radiometric dates collected from archaeological investigations conducted in 1960 and additional investigations undertaken at the Mansa earthworks site in 1988, 1994, and 1995, the Bigo earthworks have been dated to roughly AD 1300-1500, and have been called Uganda's \\"largest and most important ancient monument.\\"  Investigations  Bigo was first documented in 1909; initially by Colonial District Commissioner D. L. Baines and then followed by Major C. R. Hall who also completed the first map of the earthworks. A more comprehensive map of the earthworks was completed for the Uganda Protectorate Geological Survey by A. D. Combe in 1921. Following this, P. L. Shinnie excavated a series of trenches at Bigo in 1957 in order to investigate the purported connections between Bigo and Bacwezi legends as well as to identify the material culture of the people who built the earthworks. In the fall of 1960, M. Posnansky conducted further investigations at Bigo with the intent to \\"make as complete a survey as possible ... to establish the cultural sequence [of the site] and to obtain charcoal samples for Carbon 14 dating.\\" During his investigation of Bigo, Posnansky spent over 7 weeks excavating more than 20 trenches (with a total volume of 781 cubic feet) at four locations (three within the main enclosure area and one at the outer ditch). From these trenches Posnansky prepared sidewall illustrations characterizing the site's soils and exposing the construction history of the mounds and ditches. Also recovered from the trenches were four charcoal samples that were submitted for radiometric dating and over 4,200 pottery sherds.  Layout  Bigo is situated on the south shore of the Katonga River and is composed of an arcing, branched ditch and bank alignment encompassing both a smaller collection of enclosure as well as a crossing of the Katonga River.The outer ditches have a maximum width of more than 10 meters, range in depth from 1.5 to 4 meters, and altogether, contain approximately 20 breaks. Combined, the outer ditches run for more than 6 kilometers and encompass over 300 hectares with topography ranging from lowlands to a hilly area rising more than 4,000 feet. Situated on high ground within the outer boundary are four connected enclosures (1-4). Enclosures 1 and 2 are the largest of the group and share a northwest-southeast aligned ditch having two openings and that is only partially banked on the north side. Enclosures 3 and 4 are smaller and connected to the eastern ends of 1 and 2 (respectively) with a single opening between the large and small enclosures. Enclosures 1, 2, and 4 each have two external openings, while enclosure 3 only has one external opening. When measured from the base of the ditch to the top of the adjacent bank, the inner enclosures measure from 4 to 7 meters high. Three mounds, ranging from 2 to 3 meters tall, are found within (Mounds I and II) and adjacent to Enclosure 2 (Mound III). Of note, Mound III is positioned such that the western ditch of Enclosure 2 was constructed to avoid it. The lack of an embankment for much of the ditch between Enclosures 1 and 2 suggests the upcast soil was used to create one or more of the mounds. A single ditch and bank originating at the northwest corner of Enclosure 2 runs in a northeasterly direction and terminates at the Katonga River.  Function  Beginning in the colonial period when they were first discovered by Europeans and continuing through to the 1960s, the Bigo earthworks have been interpreted as defensive fortifications constructed to protect from invasion; however this interpretation most likely resulted from the experiences of war stemming from the Bunyoro-Buganda conflicts of the 1800s, British forts constructed elsewhere in western Uganda, and World War I. This functional interpretation was also supported by Bunyoro oral tradition from the colonial period in which claims were made that the Bacwezi and Babito dynasties invaded the region from the north. A number of factors contradict the interpretation that the earthworks were constructed to protect from human invaders, foremost among them is the fact that the overall great length of the outer ditch system is such that it would be logistically impossible to guard. Rather than protect from human invaders, it has been suggested that Bigo's outer earthworks were constructed to keep elephants from damaging agricultural crops, while the central earthworks were constructed to protect the site's rulers from attack, while serving as places where trade goods were redistributed, as well as being demonstrations of organizational skills and having a symbolic function related to the power associated with those who lived within the earthworks.  Artifacts  The 1960 excavations at Bigo recovered more than 4,200 pottery sherds from both jars and pots, as well as six hearth kerbs, one pottery bead, and iron artifacts consisting of a tanged arrowhead, part of a bracelet, a spear ferrule, and a broken knife most likely used for reaping grain. The pottery is noteworthy for decorative styling consisting of knotted grass roulette band on or just below the rims while some vessels were also painted using a red ochre slip. The pottery vessels predominantly consisted of coarse ware with fewer examples of fine ware recovered.

At the end, accept if we reached Accept node, reject if we reached Reject node, and fail otherwise. Each distinct path will be counted equally -- while some paths are more likely to be taken, this is exactly compensated by reduced likelihood of continuing along that path.  Probabilistic logspace without a time limit  If time is unlimited, the machines can run in expected exponential time -- for example, keep a counter and increment it with probability and zero it otherwise; halt when the counter overflows. If zero error (alternatively, one-sided error) is allowed, the class equals NL -- the machine can simulate NL by trying random paths for an exponential amount of time and using NL=coNL. If bounded error is allowed, a complete promise or approximation problem is estimating stationary distribution for an ergodic Markov chain. The complexity class is not known to equal PL, and an attempt to simulate PL through blackbox probability amplification fails: Despite unbounded time, bounded error logspace machines cannot distinguish a random coin from one that lands head of the time where grows superpolynomially. For unbounded error logspace machines, unbounded time can be reduced to polynomial time as follows. Computing acceptance probability can be reduced to solving a linear system. For each state , add a variable -- probability of acceptance if current state is i. If there is no path from i to Accept, set , and otherwise express in terms of states immediately reachable from state i. The system can be solved using determinants, and testing whether A>2B is in PL.A denotes determinant of One complication is that the coefficients are in NL (using NL=coNL). We address it by guessing a 'proof' for each coefficient value, failing if the guess does not work, and ensuring that all paths make the same number of guesses for each coefficient.

Biography Ludwik Paszkiewicz was born in 1907, the son of Ludwik and Janina. He studied at the Warsaw University of Technology then at the Lviv Polytechnic. In 1931 after his graduation he began military service. After completing Cadet Reserve course in Mołodeczno, Paszkiewicz entered the Polish Air Force Academy. On 4 August 1934 he was promoted to second lieutenant (podporucznik). Then he was assigned to the Polish 112th Fighter Escadrille. In 1937, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant (porucznik). The same year, he married Maria Piwnicka, and one year later their daughter was born. In 1939, he became commander of his unit. In August, he went to France with a military mission in order to buy aircraft, where the outbreak of the World War II found him. On 18 May 1940, Paszkiewicz became commander of the new formed section of the Groupe de Chasse II/8. In the Battle of Britain, the section made 33 flights, but never met the enemy. On 21 June 1940, Paskiewicz arrived in the UK. On 2 August, he was posted to No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron. On 30 August, during a training flight, he disobeyed orders and shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter. He was officially reprimanded and unofficially congratulated by his superior officer. After S/L Kellet's personal recommendation, the squadron was declared operational next day by No. 11 Group RAF. His victory was portrayed in the movie Battle of Britain. On 6 September, he became the commander of Flight B, when Wacław Łapkowski, the previous commander was wounded. The next day, Paszkiewicz downed two Dornier Do 17 light bombers. On 11 September, he shot down another Bf 110 and on 15 September he became an ace shooting down a Bf 109 fighter. On 26 September, during the visit of King George VI, No. 303 Squadron was scrambled towards a large enemy raid over Hampshire, Paszkiewicz claimed a Heinkel He 111 bomber. On 27 September, Paszkiewicz was hit by a Bf 109 and died in a crash-landing in Borough Green. His only daughter died of diphtheria in 1941. His widow took part in the Warsaw Uprising. In 1960, she entered the convent of the Immaculate Conception in Szymanów, where she was named Augustyna. She died in 1995.

Founded in 2012, it plays in the Italian basketball first division Lega Basket Serie A (LBA) since the 2019–20 season. For past club sponsorship names, see sponsorship names. History Following the Benetton family's planned withdrawal from professional basketball that would occur in July 2012 and see Benetton Treviso without backing, the Universo Treviso consortium was launched in March 2012 with the goal to assure the club's continued presence as a professional outfit. Former players, chief of which Riccardo Pittis who served as the consortium's guarantor, were at the basis of the initiative. After overcoming some hurdles thanks to the efforts of the like of Pittis, Claudio Coldebella and Paolo Vazzoler (named president), the consortium managed to obtain enough funding to create a new club on 4 July 2012, with funds from five local businessmen and the sixty-seven firms involved in the consortium. The new company managing the club, Treviso Basket s.r.l., was given Benetton Treviso's sporting rights for free, though the latter had earlier withdrawn from the first division Serie A in order to apply for the amateur leagues (as a youth club). However, the Italian Basketball Federation, who decide which clubs are admitted into the national leagues, refused Treviso Basket's application to join the Serie A, a decision upheld by the Federal Court on 2 August 2012. The explanation by Federation president Dino Meneghin was that admitting the newly created organisation would go against league rules and create an unsustainable legal precedent (indebted clubs - not the case of Benetton Treviso - forming a new organisation to stay in the league), Meneghin also bemoaned the lack of reaction since Benetton announced its withdrawal eighteen months beforehand and the fact that the two entities did not merge. The club reacted slowly, integrating the amateur Promozione (seventh division) thanks to support from Benetton Treviso transferred them their Under 19 squad and personnel. Treviso Basket earned promotion to the Serie D by winning the 2012-13 Promozione championship playoffs. It then considered a number of options to reach a higher level immediately, of which buying sporting rights from indebted clubs (requiring to service the debt as well). The side would earn a wild card to the fourth-division Divisione Nazionale B, finishing the regular season in fourth place before being eliminated in the promotion playoff quarterfinals. After buying the sporting rights of B.N.B. Corato, Universo Basket Treviso, the renamed Treviso Basket 2012 (the 2012 having been added earlier at the Italian federation's request), moved into the Serie A2 Silver, the nominal third division but soon to be merged with the second division Serie A2 Gold. Treviso would go on to win a shock 2014-15 Serie A2 Silver title in regular season, moving on to the joint Gold/Silver playoffs where they lost in the first round. On June 17, 2019, after beating Benfapp Capo d'Orlando in Game-3 of the Serie A2 Playoffs, Treviso achieved the promotion to the LBA. Arena During the first two years of its existence, Treviso Basket played in the Centro Natatorio and PalaCicogna (in Ponzano Veneto) respectively. In 2014 it moved into the PalaVerde (capacity: 5,144), the state of the art former home of Benetton Treviso.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 21 January 2013. Duttine had previously appeared in the soap between February and June 2010 as D.S. Carr, the police officer that arrested Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) for the murder of her husband, Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale). Tim is introduced as Faye Windass' (Ellie Leach) biological father. His storylines initially focused on his relationship with his long-lost daughter Faye and her adoptive family - mother Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) and her partner Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies). Tim's storylines have since revolved around his relationship to Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor)  whom he illegally married, and the birth of his granddaughter Miley (Erin, Eilah and Elsie Halliwell). Storylines Tim arrives in Weatherfield, after his biological daughter Faye Windass (Ellie Leach) makes contact with him over the internet. Faye begins sneaking out to see Tim, which her adoptive mother, Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) puts a stop to. Tim clashes with Anna's boyfriend Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) but after Faye's insistence, they allow her to visit Tim. Faye becomes growingly infatuated with her father, which escalates when Tim gets a job and moves into 15a Coronation Street, and Faye's constant pushing makes Anna let her live with Tim, to his initial delight. However, Tim soon realises the independence he has forgone in order to become a full-time father. After Faye lies to Tim about staying with Anna while he was away at a job in Newcastle for a few days, he agrees that Faye should move back in with Anna again. Owen tells Tim to leave and Tim agrees after deciding Faye would be better off without him. However, Tim has a change of heart after Faye refuses to speak to him and decides to stay in Weatherfield for good. Soon afterwards, he begins a relationship with Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor), but hides from her in his flat above the Corner Shop when she plans for them to go on a romantic weekend break to Paris together. After talking to his boss Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), Tim decides he wants a relationship with Sally and commits to her. Tim is angry when Sally leaves Faye and her friend Grace Piper (Ella-Grace Gregoire) on their own, although Grace manipulated the situation to try and cause trouble. Tim becomes concerned when Faye is questioned by the police for bullying Simon Barlow (Alex Bain). He later confides in Sally that he blames himself for being a bad father. In January 2014, Tim decides to turn over a new leaf and set up his own window cleaning business, and he leaves the building trade. He also moves in with Sally and her daughter, Sophie (Brooke Vincent). Maddie Heath (Amy James-Kelly) breaks into the house while Tim is there and when he tries to stop her, Maddie punches him. Embarrassed by what has happened, Tim lies to police and tells them a man broke in and he confronted him. Maddie tells Sophie what she did and she tells Tim that she knows Maddie punched him, but agrees to not tell Sally. Weeks later, Maddie accidentally lets slip to Sally what really happened. In May 2014, Tim and Sally realise that their relationship is not working, so Tim decides to move out and rearranges a letting agreement with Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin), so that he continue seeing Faye. The couple later realise they were wrong to split after one argument and redeclare their love. Sally is delighted when Tim proposes, but both realise they are not ready for marriage. Upon the return of Sally's ex-husband, Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) from Frankfurt, Tim decides to buy his 50% share of their house so he and Sally can have a proper future together. In April 2015, Tim is left shocked when Faye gives birth to a baby girl, who she names Miley (Erin, Eilah and Elsie Halliwell). Tim loves the idea of having a grandchild, seeing it as a second chance to be a father figure, but Faye does not want to be a mother. Tim, Anna and Owen question Faye about the baby's paternity and Owen leaves after attacking Faye's teenage friend, Craig Tinker (Colson Smith), thinking that he is the father due to him spending a lot of time with her. Anna becomes Miley's primary carer while trying to persuade Faye to take an active role in Miley's life. Tim enjoyed the time he spent with Miley and is pleased when Miley's father, Jackson begins taking responsibility; but is upset to realise Miley will spend less time with Faye. Tim suggests Faye and Jackson Hodge (Rhys Cadman) register her birth and have Miley christened. At Miley's christening, Faye breaks down and admits to Tim that she is not ready to be a mother. Seeing that Faye is unable to cope, Jackson's wealthy parents, Greig and Josie, suggest Miley live with them, leaving Tim devastated. Tim comes round to the idea, thinking it would be best for everyone. Despite Anna's reservations, Miley goes to live with Jackson and his family and the Windasses say a tearful goodbye. Weeks later, Tim admits to Anna and Faye that they, most likely, will never see Miley again, as the Hodges have emigrated to Canada. Tim and Anna discuss it with Faye and Tim promises he will get Miley back but Faye decides Miley will have a better life over there. In July 2015, Tim goes to Underworld and publicly asks Sally to \\"not marry him\\". Tim becomes close friends with her ex-husband Kevin, sometimes even irritating him. On Kevin's birthday, Tim buys Kevin a friendship bracelet, which Kevin secretly dislikes. On the same day, Sally kisses Kevin, but they decide to keep it secret. Months later, Anna discovers the truth and whilst drunk, tells Tim in front of everyone in the Rovers. A furious Tim ends his engagement to Sally, leaving her devastated. Sally becomes depressed and stands firm that the wedding will take place, despite Tim's refusal to acknowledge her. Kevin and Anna try to convince Tim to reconcile with Sally, with Kevin finally getting through to him. Sally stands at the altar with Sophie, Faye and Rita Tanner (Barbara Knox) and refuses to leave until Tim joins her. Tim eventually arrives and they get married. Tim and Sally then go on their honeymoon and when they return, it is clear they are happy together. In early-December 2015, Tim is overwhelmed with guilt when he accidentally runs over Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) in his new van, however Sally and other residents of the street attempt to convince Tim that it was not his fault. Sally later buys Lloyd Mullaney's (Craig Charles) share of the StreetCars taxi firm for Tim, with Tim working alongside co-owner Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), sparking a new friendship. Sally is elected a local councillor for Weatherfield but her snobbish behaviour puts a strain on her and Tim's marriage, so he begins to brew his own beer, which becomes very successful with the residents. When Steve discovers that Will Chatterton (Leon Ockenden) kissed his wife Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh), Tim fights with Will for Steve as his arm is in a sling. In March 2018, Tim becomes instrumental in exposing the crimes perpetuated by Anna's rapist and Eileen's husband: Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre). He first manages to entrap Phelan in admitting to his role in the \\"Calcutta Street\\" flats scam project, though is unable to get Phelan to confess to framing Anna for pushing their daughter's boyfriend - Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) - off a ladder as well as killing both Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis) and Luke Britton (Dean Fagan). However, the truth about Phelan is publicly revealed when Gary and Seb - while seeking to uncover the gun Phelan used to kill Luke - end up unearthing the bodies of Phelan's two other murdered victims: Michael's surrogate son Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) and Phelan's ex-business partner Vinny Ashford (Ian Kelsey). Upon learning from Gary about this, Tim alerts Eileen about Phelan's crimes and he along with her best friend Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) race over to the cottage where the pair are stating at - where they are relieved to find Eileen safe and that Phelan is presumed dead. The following day, Tim informs most of the residents about Phelan's crimes as the police descend into Weatherfield. In December 2019, Tim discovers he is a bigamist as he is already married to a woman named Charlie Wood (Siân Reeves) following a wedding in Las Vegas in 2004, making his marriage to Sally invalid. Casting The character was revealed to be entering the show in August 2012 by series producer, Phil Collinson. He stated \\"We know that Faye's mother is dead, but there's a father out there somewhere and he's going to come along and challenge things for Anna.\\" On 13 January 2013, it was announced that Joe Duttine had been cast in the role of Tim. Tom Eames from Digital Spy reported that Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) would become concerned for her adoptive daughter, Faye, when she makes contact with Tim online. A spokeswoman commented that Anna is hurt when she learns that Faye has contacted Tim and warns him to stay away. Development=Relationship with Sally Webster In 2013, Tim began a relationship with the snobby Sally Webster, portrayed by Sally Dynevor. Talking about Sally and Tim's new relationship, Dynevor said: \\"He's a bit of a commitment-phobe so I'm not sure [what will happen], but he's nice and Sally really likes him. She's trying to change him - manipulate him into what she wants! But he's not having it and he wants to go off down the pub, and doesn't want to spend any romantic weekends with her or anything. He's a real bloke - he wants his tea on the table!\\" Dynevor later spoke out on the relationship, stating she thought the relationship was doomed to fail: \\"I didn't really want Sally to find someone at first, but I like this relationship because she's not found 'Mr Perfect'. All the other men Sally's been with, I could easily have seen her having long term relationships with them. With Tim, you know there's no way they're going to live happily ever after, they're going to drive each other insane. I like the drama that has to offer.\\" In an interview on ITV chat show, Loose Women, Duttine said that he does not want Tim to change his unreliable ways, but said he thought Tim \\"does really love\\" Sally. However, Dynevor was ultimately wrong as Tim and Sally's relationship became popular with viewers and therefore, continued from strength-to-strength. In November 2013, show producer Stuart Blackburn teased that Tim and Sally's relationship could be tested by the return of Sally's ex-husband, Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) the following year: \\"Kevin left at a point when he really thought he wanted to get back with Sally. Kevin loves Sally and seeing her with another man will be heartbreaking for him, but he’s going to have to man up and deal with it.\\" In January 2014, OK! reported that Tim would become involved in a love triangle with Sally and Kevin following his impending return to the show. In September 2014, as Kevin was set to return, Blackburn told Digital Spy that they would not be reuniting Kevin and Sally, \\"Kevin will always regret what he did in the past and there'll always be a 'What if?' when it comes to Sally. His love for Sally won't go away, but I think it's time for him to move on and he will do that. Kevin has figured out now that Tim and Sally are for real. If there is going to be any type of affair, it's more likely to be Tim and Kevin heading off for a pint behind Sally's back!\\" In May 2014, Tim decided his relationship with Sally should come to an end and dumped her. Discussing Tim's reason behind his actions, Duttine said: \\"She was getting a bit judgmental about Tim’s opinion of Maddie, and she wasn’t very sympathetic about Maddie’s situation with Ben. Plus, she was being a bit snobby about his window cleaning job. She lost her sense of humour, and I think when Tim tried to lighten the mood, it didn’t go down very well. He just thought she was being too much of a nightmare and bailed out. For Tim, it’s all about having an easy life and not wanting too much conflict or confrontation.\\" They quickly reunited and when Sally spots Tim in a jewellers, she jumps to the conclusion he is going to propose. This makes Tim consider proposing to Sally. Talking to Lynn Connolly of Unreality TV, Duttine said: \\"He goes in there to buy Faye a watch, but then Sally jumps to the conclusion that he’s going to propose to her. He then goes to buy a ring with the intention of proposing to Sally because he feels it’s what she wants, not because he wants it. So I guess he does love her, and he’s putting her first and trying to please her.\\" Duttine continued to say how after Tim proposes, they discuss their relationship and realise neither of them want to get married, before revealing he \\"un-proposes\\" to Sally in the Rovers Return Inn. Duttine said he thought this was \\"sweet\\". Duttine also went on to say how he felt Tim and Sally were a \\"good, fun couple\\". In May 2015, Duttine and Dynevor discussed Tim and Sally's relationship with Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on ITV daytime programme, This Morning, with Dynevor saying how she initially thought Tim and Sally would not go well as a couple: \\"I was like, 'Tim Metcalfe and Sally Webster – how is that going to work?' but as soon as they put us together and we got the script and starting working together we found things hilariously funny.\\" Duttine commented that Tim is \\"just pleased to be here and glad somebody will have him.\\" and Dynevor agreed, saying that Sally \\"feels the same – she’s just glad she has a boyfriend!\\" Live episode (2015) Coronation Street announced their plans for a live episode in September 2015 to mark the sixtieth anniversary of ITV on 19 November 2014. The show's producer, Stuart Blackburn, said: \\"We’ve a reputation to uphold after the success of the tram crash and I’m going to enjoy working with the storyliners and writers as we plot stories for our live episode in 2015. We’ll be doing all we can to eclipse what’s gone before.\\" In August 2015, a new storyline began airing which saw Sally and Kevin share a small kiss, behind Tim's back and then choose not to tell him. Michael Le Vell (who plays Kevin) told Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy that Kevin would be left \\"in total shock and disbelief\\" and is \\"genuinely shocked\\" when Sally kisses him. Despite Kevin and Sally agreeing to not tell Tim, Le Vell said he thought the kiss would be revealed to Tim: \\"I don't think it will stay a secret, no. I'm not sure who will tell who but I do know Sophie is quite suspicious - whether anyone else close to Sally or Kevin will be brought into the loop I don't know. But if Tim finds out, he's not going to be happy.\\" Annie Price of the Daily Express revealed the storylines that would be featured in the live episode as to be: the Platt family's feud with Callum Logan (Sean Ward) reaching its climax; the beginning of Roy Cropper's (David Neilson) relationship with Cathy Matthews (Melanie Hill); and the comedic element to the show, Tim's discovery that Kevin and Sally shared a kiss. Le Vell later revealed that the secret would be exposed in the live episode by a character that is drunk: \\"I think that someone spills the beans in a very drunken stupor in the live [episode]. I don't know what the consequences are going to be but there's something very exciting.\\" On 9 September 2015, Coronation Street announced that the live episode would air for an hour on 23 September in a 19.30 timeslot. The cast gathered for their first read through of the live episode script on 8 September. On 13 September, Le Vell and Brooke Vincent (who plays Sally's daughter, Sophie) told STV that the storyline involving Sally, Tim and Kevin would \\"inject a little bit of humour\\" into the live episode. Vincent went on to say how viewers will \\"have to keep watching\\" to find out if the wedding will commence. Describing the role Sally, Kevin and Tim's storyline plays in the live episode, Le Vell said: \\"It’s all linked to Tim and Sally’s wedding and I think someone lets the cat out the bag – we don’t know who that is – about the kiss on their wedding day, but we don’t know the full impact of Tim finding out.\\" Duttine spoke to Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, insisting that Tim should not become aggressive when he discovers Sally and Kevin's kiss: \\"I don't really want to see Tim become aggressive or become a player either. I just think that he's a decent bloke who likes his creature comforts and a simple life.\\" Duttine continued to talk about the fallout of the revelation: \\"I think Tim will be heartbroken when he finds out the truth. It's definitely not going to be plain sailing. As for whether Tim will punch Kevin, I don't think Tim's the fighting type.\\" Duttine and Dynevor later discussed their thoughts on going live with Katie Fitzpatrick from the Manchester Evening News, with Duttine admitting that going live is one of \\"the scariest thing you’ve ever done because you don’t want to be the first one to mess up Coronation Street after years and years.\\" Dynevor admitted she was worried she would break into uncontrollable laughter, \\"My fear, working with Joe, is corpsing for me. Once you start laughing you can’t stop.\\" In the build-up to the live episode, Anna overheard Sally discussing her kiss with Kevin to Sophie, leaving her intrigued. The episode aired on 23 September and featured a drunk Anna telling Tim that Sally had kissed Kevin a matter of weeks before. Despite Sally's best efforts to convince Tim that Anna was lying, he realised Anna was not lying and left the pub in shock and upset. Tim then packed his bags and stayed with Anna and Faye, leaving Sally crying into the arms of Sophie. The episode was met with positive reviews with many Twitter users tweeting their views on the live episode and Duttine's acting. Family In May 2014, Dianne Bourne, reporting for the Manchester Evening News, said producers were looking to cast a disabled actor in his 40s. The character, named Howie, was branded a \\"cheeky chappy\\" by Bourne. Later, in September, it was revealed that Howie would be the cousin of Tim, with show producer Stuart Blackburn teasing Tim and Howie's relationship: \\"There is also going to be a new character called Howie arriving. He is Tim's cousin and will be providing much more fun for the Websters. In the past, Tim's relationship with Howie has been incredibly fragile. They never see eye to eye, and Howie loves winding up Tim.\\" Despite Blackburn also mentioning that the show were in the final stages of auditioning and that Howie would begin appearing in early 2015, Howie never appeared. In March 2018, Ian Bartholomew joined the cast as Geoff Metcalfe, Tim's father. Geoff's relation to Tim was not revealed until transmission on 30 March, although viewers of the show guessed the twist beforehand. In July 2020, after the introduction of Geoff's ex-wife Elaine Jones (Paula Wilcox), fans began theorising that she is Tim's biological mother, despite Geoff telling Tim that his mother, whom he named Tessa Metcalfe, is dead. Producers later confirmed the theory to be correct. Reception James Brinsford of the Metro praised Coronation Street for highlighting the issue of illiteracy through Tim, stating that less than one per cent of adults are completely illiterate and said \\"Bravo Corrie!\\" for showing that despite the low statistics, it is still possible. Radio Times David Brown praised the pairing of Tim and Sally, commenting: \\"Tim and Sally have been comedy gold since they got together\\". Dan Martin of The Guardian also praised Sally and Tim's relationship, calling it \\"the best story in Corrie of recent months.\\" He went on to say: \\"If they can play the serious emotional stuff as well as they have done the comedy, they’ll surely seal their place in the Corrie Couples Hall of Fame\\". Duttine and Dynevor won the award for Best On-Screen Partnership at the 2015 British Soap Awards. They were nominated for the same award at the Inside Soap Awards of the same year. Duttine was also nominated for Funniest Male in the award ceremony. Duttine made the shortlist, eventually winning the award. However, Duttine and Dynevor did not make the shortlist and Emmerdale Charlie Hardwick and Chris Chittell (who play Val and Eric Pollard) won the award.

The lordship of Wrentham Northall, or Poinings, belonged to Sir Thomas Radcliffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, until 1567, when he sold it to Arthur Choute, who sold it to Humphrey Brewster in 1577.Copinger, Manors of Suffolk, II, pp. 213-17 (Internet Archive); citing a Fine levied in Michaelmas Term, 19-20 Elizabeth. The Hall was built to a conventional Elizabethan E-plan. It passed down in the Brewster family from Humphrey to his son Francis (1566-1644) and from Francis to his son Robert Brewster (1599-1633), a Parliamentary commissioner during the Civil War and MP for both Dunwich and Suffolk.

A bastille is a fortification located at the principal entrance to a town or city; as such it is a similar type of fortification to a barbican, and the distinction between the two is frequently unclear. While today found in a variety of cities, such as Grenoble and Lübeck, the word bastille is associated above all with the famous bastille in Paris, the Saint Anthony Bastille, which played a prominent part in the history of France under its monarchy. Bastilles were often forts, but could be more similar to gatehouses in smaller settlements.

It produced several officials and military commanders, as well as one emperor, Constantine IX Monomachos (). The first occurrences of the name are unclear, and may refer to sobriquets rather to members of the family. An iconoclast bishop of Nicomedia with the name is alluded to in the 9th-century hagiography of St. Joannicius, whereas a fervently anti-iconoclast official was Niketas Monomachos during the early 9th century, who was later declared a saint. An obscure functionary named Monomachos is attested in , but the family did not really come to the fore until the 11th century, when Constantine IX became emperor. The contemporary family members, including Constantine's own father Theodosios, were chiefly judges active in the imperial capital of Constantinople. The sole exception was George Monomachos, doux of Dyrrhachium under Nikephoros III Botaneiates (), but dismissed by Alexios I Komnenos (). A female relative of Constantine IX married Vsevolod of Kiev. Their son Vladimir II Monomakh adopted his mother's surname. The family fell into obscurity during the Komnenian period, and only reappears at the end of the 12th century. From the turn of the 13th century and until the loss of the region to the Turks in the early 14th century, family members are also recorded in Asia Minor, e.g. John Monomachos (), a friend of the statesman Nikephoros Choumnos, and the general Alexios Philanthropenos. His contemporaries, the brothers George Atouemes Monomachos and Michael Senachereim Monomachos, became senior officials and generals.

Career He formed his political consulting firm Informe confidencial (Confidential report) in the late 1970s. He studied sociology under the guidance of Manuel Mora y Araujo. During the 90s he was a consultant in Colombia, of the Liberal Alternative Party of Pablo Escobar, having to leave the country after the arrest of Escobar. From 1998 to 2000 he was Secretary of Public Administration in Ecuador under the presidency of Jamil Mahuad, who months later was dismissed from his duties in January 2000 and is currently a fugitive from justice in his country for embezzlement. He has advised Mexican president Felipe Calderón and Ecuadorian politician Álvaro Noboa. Since 2005, he ran successive campaigns for Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri. In October 2011, the Front for Victory's attorney, Juan Manuel Olmos, denounced him before the federal electoral judge of Buenos Aires, María Servini, for an alleged electoral crime consisting of a covert campaign against the candidate of that front, Daniel Filmus. The campaign would have consisted of automatic telephone calls with a message falsely linking Filmus's father to Sergio Schoklender. In September 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that, due to a matter of competences, the case must be brought before the justice system of the City of Buenos Aires. Duran Barba and his associates were investigated and prosecuted in the case. Tag Continental, Connectic SRL and Opinión Confidencial, the company created at the end of 2008 by Rodrigo Lugones and Guillermo Garat, the two favorite students of the star consultant of the PRO, were searched for that investigation. He published El Arte de Ganar (\\"The Art of Winning\\"), a book on the use of attacking strategies for political campaigns, in 2010. In his book, Durán Barba was singled out for promoting dirty campaigns and praised his own strategies by remembering in his tactics in a chapter of his book where he declared: \\"Sometimes, the attack of a politician was so brutal that his adversary psychologically annihilated, and even came to suicide.\\" In 2015 he was denounced before the National Electoral Directorate in a complaint for \\"defamation\\" against the candidate of the Frente para la Victoria; rival of Cambiemos that Mauricio Macri leads, whom he accuses of launching a \\"dirty campaign\\" by using social networks for photographs and false images to damage the image of Scioli. \\"The defamation campaign includes photos of catastrophes that occurred in Central American countries, editions of false images of Daniel Scioli and Karina Rabolini in paradisiacal places. In 2017, Vice President Gabriela Michetti and counselor Jaime Durán Barba, among other officials, were criminally charged in the federal courts for mounting a network of official trolls financed with public funds from the Senate with the aim of intimidating opponents. According to the complaint, the vice president would have set up a network of pro-government tweeters, and to finance this device would have diverted at least 1.5 million pesos from the Senate. In the complaint, Eduardo Cura, ex-husband of the president of the Senate and director of the Canal Ciudad, and Paula Schuster, spokesperson for Michetti, were also included. In 2018, in the Official Gazette on Monday, January 22, the allocation of 247 million pesos to 10 consultants was revealed to carry out 67 surveys in the next 6 months for the government of the City of Buenos Aires. As a result of them, a Buenos Aires newspaper revealed that two of these companies are closely linked to Jaime Durán Barba, Inversora Boroca SA and Green Consult SRL. Together, they received benefits for almost 71 million pesos from the government of Rodriguez Larreta. Parallelly according to the News Magazine that same month, between 2016 and 2017, Inversora Boroca SA billed the Buenos Aires Government directed by the PRO, around 7 million pesos. \\" The IGJ observed the papers presented for the capital increase and demanded the presentation of the balance owed. It has a department in Recoleta, registered in the name of Trabulsi Management INC, a company created in 1999 in the British Virgin Islands - one of the largest tax havens on the planet, of which Durán Barba and his partner were directors and even had a general power of attorney to operate on his behalf when he settled in Panama. Trabulsi Management INC has no offices or activity in Argentina, but was registered in the AFIP, according to official records, in November 2015, ten days before the triumph of Macri over Daniel Scioli in the presidential ballotage.  Political views  Durán Barba has expressed pro-choice views regarding the abortion debate. In an interview published by La Nación in November 2014, Durán Barba said, referring to Cambiemos: \\"We are in favor of freedom; [...] if a woman wants to have an abortion, let her have an abortion\\".

King Alfonso died a year earlier. Background Infante Juan originally supported the Francoist regime, which matched with his political beliefs, since he was a long-time supporter of Spanish Action—in fact, Eugenio Vegas Latapié, one of his founders, was one of his closest advisers. He tried to join the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War, though he was stopped by Emilio Mola and Francisco Franco twice, respectively.

During śmiergust young men are dousing young unmarried women with water. The celebrations take place on the Market Square of Wilamowice on Wet Monday (Easter Monday), and in or near the women's homes on Easter Sunday. Śmiergust participants are groups of dressed-up men, wearing special patchwork costumes.Gara, Józef. „Wilamowscy Śmirguśnicy”, in: „Zbiór wierszy o wilamowskich obrzędach i obyczajach oraz Słowniku języka wilamowskiego”, Bielsko-Biała 2004, p. 31  Historical outline  Traditionally, at Śmiergust, groups of dressed-up men walk from house to house, visiting homes and dousing girls with water. The custom is sometimes observed on Easter Sunday – mostly in the area surrounding Oświęcim; specific locations include Kozy and Wilamowice.„Koziańskie wiadomości”, in: „Spotkania z historią - Śmirguśnicy”, B. Jurzak, p. 21 The custom was first described by Józef Latosiński in his 1909 book entitled Monografia miasteczka Wilamowice (): \\"(…) On the second day of Easter, in the afternoon, young men dress up as girls and adult girls as men. Some of them wear masks; they visit houses, play accordion music and douse passers-by with water; this procession is called \\"smirgust\\" (…)\\".Latosiński, J. „Monografia miasteczka Wilamowic”, Kraków 1909, p. 253  The ritual and participants  Śmiergustnicy dousing water on a girl in front of her house. The participants of Śmiergust have dressed up as various characters: \\"(…)doctors, Jews, chimney sweeps, cart drivers or (…) women. At a certain point they began creating their costumes from patches of old items of women's clothing, which resulted in a colourful, motley effect\\".Majerska, J. „Wymysiöejer fibl”, Warsaw 2013, p. 20 They also wear hats decorated with crepe flowers which symbolise the coming spring, as well as hand-painted paper-mâché masks, worn to conceal the owner's identity. The Śmiergust group is made up form young men (aged 16–25), who walk from house to house throughout the night and – after dousing girls with water – receive food and drinks.„Europejskie i regionalne instrumenty ochrony języków zagrożonych”, red. L. M. Nijakowski, Warsaw 2013, p. 84 Jolanta Danek, an ethnographer living in Wilamowice, recalls that \\"(…) on Sunday evening the men gather in a house of one of the participants.\\" The group usually includes an accordion player, who accompanies the conduct on Easter Sunday and Monday. Śmiergust characters \\"walk into every house in which a single young woman can be found. Quite often they have an opportunity to visit a home they wouldn't dare enter otherwise. They douse girls with water, dance and sing.\\" The women on whom a lot of water has been poured during Śmiergust could be certain of their popularity and – possibly – marriage. A group of Śmiergust participants with a bath on wheels filled with water; Wilamowice, PolandJózef Gara wrote in his poem titled \\"Dy Wymysöjer Śmiergüśnika\\" (): \\"(…) Śmiergust boys have to know and take care / not to miss a house where girls live / not to upset a girl (…)\\". Śmiergust participants continue dousing people with water on Easter Monday. They gather on the market square and when the women leave the church, they are caught and doused with water. The characters also stage impromptu shows and play tricks on their hosts (such as carrying a cart onto a barn's roof). The arrival of Śmiergust men is announced by the noise of dragged cans, whistles, trumpets and the ensuing singing and music. The noise and music perform a symbolic function – to awaken \\"the sleeping life of nature\\".  Forgotten tradition  Mask used by Śmiergust participant Two elements of the Easter customs in Wilamowice – or with the participants' costumes – are no longer practised. The custom of dousing with water was supposed to bring good fortune and luck to the young women. Sources mention that on Easter Monday it was customary to support the hopes of a good harvest: \\"(…) On Palm Sunday they bless Easter palms, which they later keep in houses, stuck under the roof. From these palms they then fashion crosses, and on Easter Monday place those crosses in the fields, so that the Lord allows a good harvest. This custom is called \\"holy śmirgust”. In Wilamowice, Śmiergust costumes used to be worn on the third day of a wedding: \\"(…) Best men and bridesmaids, as well as other young guests, would dress up on the last day of the wedding – men as women, women as men, best men as the bridegroom, etc.; they would hide behind indistinguishable make-up and travel around on decked-out carts, play music, and join a second round of celebrations. They collected bottles of spirits in their baskets or even snatch a hen and then gift it to the young couple for good luck(…)”.  The past and the present times  The tradition of Śmiergust and pouring water on young women continues to be a vibrant element of immaterial cultural heritage in Wilamowice. The custom is also kept alive by folklore groups: the group Wilamowice-Fil performs \\"A Wedding in Wilamowice\\", \\"Pastorale\\" and \\"Śmiergust\\".Kurpierz, C. „Wilamowice – zagadka i tajemnica.

He is suspected of being the only surviving member of the group directly involved in the attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015 (in which 130 people were killed and 683 others were injured) through providing logistical support for the assailants, driving them to their target locations, and having some involvement in the manufacture of the explosives used. Having evaded authorities, he became the target of one of the largest manhunts in modern European history. Europol had Abdeslam as first in a list of wanted criminals out of 57 individuals listed publicly by the organisation in January 2016.. Abdeslam is known to have had contacts or social links to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), as ISIL subsequently made a claim of responsibility for the attack. Of the men known to be involved in the attacks, he and Mohammad Abrini are the only two still alive - all others involved either having killed themselves or having been killed by French police officers. After about four months on the run, Abdeslam was apprehended on 18 March 2016, following a shootout that occurred during a police raid conducted in the Molenbeek area of Brussels. On 23 April, Salah Abdeslam was sentenced in Brussels to 20 years in prison for the shootout. Personal background Salah Abdeslam was born on 15 September 1989 in Brussels, Belgium. His parents are immigrants who were living in Bouyafar, a small village in northern Morocco, before emigration. Though the Abdeslams lived in Belgium from the 1960s, they were all French nationals, having acquired French nationality from the time the parents lived in Algeria. Abdeslam and Abdelhamid Abaaoud were friends as children, when both were living in Sint-Jans-Molenbeek. Another childhood friend stated that Abdeslam liked football and motorbikes. According to a woman to whom Abdeslam was briefly engaged in 2011, he and Abaaoud continued to be close friends into adulthood. Following his arrest, Abdeslam claimed he met Abaaoud on only one occasion. Abdeslam was employed by STIB- MIVB as a mechanic from September 2009 to 2011. His employment was discontinued in January 2011, one source states his employment was terminated due to his repeated absences, but Abdeslam's ex-fiancée stated that his employment was terminated due to an act or multiple acts of crime, for which he was subsequently sentenced to one month in jail. From December 2013, Abdeslam was the manager of a bar named Les Béguines in Molenbeek, located west of Brussels, after his brother Brahim took over the license. Most of the bar's customers were of Maghrebian origin. The bar was closed when authorities discovered that hallucinogenic substances were being used there. He and his brother sold the bar about six weeks before the attacks. Abdeslam was already known to police authorities as a person involved in petty crime. Another source claimed both he and Abaaoud were imprisoned for armed robbery in 2010. According to a lawyer representing Abaaoud, his client and Abdeslam were arrested in December 2010 for attempting to break into a parking garage. In February 2011, Abaaoud and Abdeslam were convicted at a Nivelles court for two acts of theft committed in December 2010 at Ottignies and Rixensart. Their respective sentences were both suspended. At the same time, Abdeslam was convicted for breaking and entering. Abdeslam was convicted of theft again in February 2014 and fined €250, relating to an act he committed in 2012. In February 2015, he was arrested by Dutch police and charged for possession of cannabis. He was subsequently fined €70. Abdeslam collected €19,000 in unemployment benefits from the Belgian government until a few weeks before the Paris attacks. Because he was gainfully occupied at the time, he should have been ineligible for those benefits. After Abdeslam was tied to the attacks, various newspapers visited bars in Brussels's gay village, and reported that some bartenders there identified him as a frequent patron. The Sunday Times published a widely quoted comment from \\"Julien\\", a bartender who recognized Abdeslam as a patron; he said that he and his colleagues had speculated he was a \\"rent boy\\". Other reporters speculated that Abdeslam wasn't necessarily gay, and that his visits to the gay bars may have been to gauge when and where the bars were most vulnerable as potential targets for bombing attacks. Preceding the attacks A woman Abdeslam was engaged to at the time of the attacks stated that he became radicalized from the influence of Abaaoud, after Abaaoud had returned from a period of terrorist activity in Syria sometime in 2014. According to a number of sources, several months before the attacks, both Salah and Brahim Abdeslam had quit drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes and began to pray devoutly. Abdeslam was questioned by police sometime during the first few months of 2015, after a terrorist plot was foiled in Verviers. The plot involved contacts of Abaaoud. Ahmet Dahmani was with Abdeslam in August 2015, when the two travelled from Italy to Greece and back using a ferry service. Dahmani was arrested on 21 November in Antalya, Turkey, as a member of an ISIL-affiliated Belgian-French network. Within the nine months preceding the attacks, Abdeslam traveled to six countries, including Germany and Austria, which he visited in October 2015, according to the German Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Maizière. After his arrest and subsequent questioning, the French public prosecutor stated that Abdeslam was traveling throughout the countries as an effort to transport individuals, who would later be involved in the attacks, into Europe. In October 2015, Abdeslam purchased twelve remote detonators and a number of batteries from a fireworks shop in St-Ouen-l'Aumône, Val d'Oise, as well as 15 litres of peroxide. Abdeslam was named on a list of people suspected of involvement in terrorist activities, which was provided to the mayor of Molenbeek by the intelligence services of Belgium on 26 October. The mayor later stated that she did not use the list to track down possible terrorists, adding that it was the responsibility of the federal police. Le Point reported that Abdeslam used the website booking.com to rent rooms 311 and 312 of the Apart'City hotel in Alfortville, two days before the attacks. Police found, among other things, syringes, pizza, and chocolate cake in the room. DNA traces indicated Abdeslam shared the room with others. According to another source, the rooms were apparently booked from 11 November to 17 November. A man named Mohamed Abrini was seen with Abdeslam on video footage recovered by police from 11 November. In the footage, the two had stopped a black Renault Clio at a petrol station. Abrini drove Abdeslam to Paris on 11 November. According to statements made to France 2, Salah Abdeslam and his brother Brahim were seen arguing on the night of 12 November. Involvement in Paris attacks Abdeslam was allegedly involved in assisting the attackers by hiring cars, flats, and hotel rooms. An unconfirmed source, said to be an associate of Abdeslam, testified that he heard Abdeslam claiming he had shot people in Paris, while he and Abdeslam were driving away from the city after the attacks. Abdeslam rented a black Volkswagen Polo, which he allegedly used to drive the Bataclan theatre attackers. Both Salah and Brahim Abdeslam were traced to two vehicles, a SEAT and the Volkswagen rented by Salah. Occupants of the car also shot individuals at the Casa Nostra pizza restaurant and the La Belle Équipe cafe. Three male passengers, one of whom was Brahim Abdeslam, killed a number of people using machine guns while they were on terraces of bars in the 10th and 11th arrondissements of Paris. The SEAT León model car was later recovered; Kalashnikov automatic rifles and magazines were found inside. Another report stated that five full and eleven empty magazines were found in the vehicle, along with fingerprint evidence. Later, forensic analysis of a discarded suicide belt found at rue Frederic Chopin in the Paris suburb of Montrouge found traces of sweat. The DNA of the sweat was matched to DNA samples held by police services for Abdeslam. DNA reportedly found on the discarded belt did not match a sample of Abdeslam's DNA obtained by police. Escape Abdeslam bought a SIM card at the Place Albert Kahn in the 18th arrondissement at about 22:00 hours. He phoned a detainee at Namur prison, Abdheila Chouaa, who was closely acquainted with Mohamed Abrini. Abdeslam then made a phone call to associates in Brussels, requesting they drive to him in order to help him escape. He was heard crying at the time of the call. He wandered the streets for a period of approximately seven to nine hours until he was collected at approximately 07:00 hours. A data trace of the aforementioned call shows Abdeslam was in Montrouge at the time, and that the call was transmitted by a cell tower in Châtillon, likely either Châtillon-la-Borde or Châtillon, Hauts- de-Seine. Salah was subsequently collected while he was near the Boulevard Barbès in the 18th arrondissement of Paris; Hamza Attou and Mohammed Amri were subsequently arrested because they drove Abdeslam after the shootings, and were charged with participating in a terrorist act by the Belgian authorities. The vehicle carrying Abdeslam, Attou, and Amri was stopped by officers at Cambrai en route to Belgium, but allowed to continue because there was no evidence of Abdeslam's involvement in the attacks at the time. According to the Belgian interior minister, Jan Jambon, a database at the police checkpoint began showing details on Abdeslam fifteen minutes after his departure from the checkpoint. The officers at the checkpoint were also distracted by the smell of marijuana, which had earlier been smoked by Attou and Amri. They dropped Abdeslam at a shopping centre where he bought a new pair of jeans, a jacket and cap, stuffing his old clothes into a rubbish bin. He then bought a new phone and got a new hairstyle from a barbershop. An acquaintance, Ali Oulkadi, dropped him off in Schaerbeek. Abdeslam was believed to have briefly stayed at the flat of Ayoub Bazarouj at some point after arriving in Belgium. Bazarouj was arrested on 16 November and his flat was searched; the search recovered ten mobile phones. Ali Oulkadi, who was detained by Brussels police, provided assistance to Abdeslam by driving him to another part of Brussels on 14 November. Oulkadi claimed he received a phone call from someone requesting him to drive someone to an unspecified location. He stated he was unaware at the time the person was Abdeslam. Oulkadi drove to Laeken, where he found Abdeslam and the caller. Oulkadi and Abdeslam went to a café where a brief verbal exchange ensued on the events of Paris. Afterwards, Abdeslam was given directions to Schaerbeek. Manhunt French and Belgian authorities released Abdeslam's photo and name on 15 November 2015. Abdeslam's brother Mohammed gave a televised message to his brother, urging him to turn himself in if he was involved in the attacks. On 9 or 10 December, police entered an apartment at 86 Rue Berge in the Schaerbeek district of Brussels, which had been rented under a false name. Police found, among other things, a fingerprint belonging to Abdeslam, traces of an explosive known as TATP, and three handmade belts. Abdeslam journeyed to the Henri Bergé flat on 14 November, and later departed apparently after two searches were made by police within the area on 4 December. In December 2015, a police dossier was made on a person suspected of having been radicalized and living in the same Rue des Quatre Vents flat. However, it was not passed to the relevant authority because, according to the Mechelen chief of police, an officer of his team had forgotten to do so. The Mechelen police had previously received information from Abid Aberkan, a nephew of Abdeslam, who told officers that he thought his uncle might be hiding in Mechelen. The flat Abdeslam was discovered in was occupied by members of Aberkan's family. At 10:00 on 16 December, Belgian police entered a location where Abdeslam was believed to have been hiding. It was reported that the authorities were unable to enter the location during the previous day because of a Belgian law that prohibited officers from forcibly entering a home between the hours of 21:00 and 05:00, except for situations where services were acting to apprehend criminals suspected of specific crimes. In addition, the authorities had to wait in order to eliminate the risk towards children at a school and 200–300 worshipers at a mosque, both close to the location. New images of Abdeslam were released by the French media on 11 January 2016. The images were taken from a petrol station located at Trith- Saint-Léger and dated to the morning after the attacks. On 25 January 2016, it was reported that ISIL videos released to the public showed footage of nine persons involved in the attacks, all of whom are now deceased. No footage of Abdeslam was featured. On 15 March 2016, police conducted an anti-terrorist raid a flat in Forest where Abdeslam was believed to have been staying at one point. Though they expected the flat to be empty, they were fired upon by Mohamed Belkaid, an accomplice of Abdeslam's. Before being shot and killed by a police sniper, Belkaid provided suppressive fire while Abdeslam and another accomplice escaped the flat through the rooftops. A trace of DNA belonging to Abdeslam was later found in the apartment, as well as detonators an automatic rifle, eleven rifle magazines, and a book of Salafism, a so-called fundamentalist movement of Islam. The Forest flat had been rented by Khalid El Bakraoui, one of the suicide bombers involved in the 2016 Brussels bombings, under a false name. Following their escape from the flat, Abdeslam and the other man phoned an associate who was being monitored by Belgian police, allowing authorities to make preparations for a second raid. Capture On 18 March 2016, Abdeslam was arrested in an anti-terror police raid on a flat occupied by the Aberkan family, located at 79 Rue des Quatre Vents of Molenbeek in Brussels, close to the location of his childhood home. The raid started at approximately 16:30 hours (CET), about an hour after Belgian prosecutors confirmed that they had found Abdeslam's fingerprint in an apartment in the Forest area of Brussels. He was captured at about 19:00 hours (CET). On 16 April, the Interior Minister of Belgium, Jan Jambon, stated that protesters \\"threw stones and bottles at police and press\\" during Abdeslam's arrest. During the raid, Abdeslam was shot through the leg and captured. Sources conflict as to whether he was shot while fleeing from police officers or charging towards them in an apparent attempt to commit suicide by cop. He was subsequently taken to Saint Peters Hospital in Brussels for treatment, where he was kept for a little under eight hours. He had managed to evade capture for approximately 126 days. Abdeslam was unarmed at the time of his arrest. According to a reporter based in Brussels, a spokesman for the Paris prosecutor's office stated Abdeslam's capture was made due to a combination of \\"telephony and surveillance\\". A second source stated that suspicion was apparently aroused to the location after a person in the flat made an unusually large pizza order. When officers arrived at the scene, they found the woman who made the food order with two other adults, children, and Abdeslam. Another suspect, identified as Monir Ahmed Alaaj, was injured during the raid. Several other people were arrested, including Alaaj and three of Abdeslam's relatives. A third suspect, identified as 24-year-old Belgian citizen Najim Laachraoui, escaped. Laachraoui's DNA was found on a piece of cloth and a suicide vest found inside the Bataclan theatre, as well as a device detonated at the Stade de France. Laachraoui was later identified as a suicide bomber at Brussels Airport. Abdeslam later stated during questioning he had driven the vehicle to the Stade de France attacks. Detention and legal proceedings Abdeslam was moved from hospital to Brussels' police headquarters and charged, and subsequently transferred to maximum security imprisonment in a Bruges jail on the night of 19 March. According to a spokeswoman for prisons of Belgium, he was placed into an area of the prison known as the \\"Individual and Special Safety\\" wing. The area of the prison was built for those \\"people who pose an escape risk and those with behavioural problems in the normal prison\\". The French government made a request for Abdeslam to be extradited from Belgium, which Abdeslam did not oppose. A Belgian federal prosecutor charged Abdeslam with \\"participation in terrorist murder and participation in the activities of a terrorist organization\\". He was due to appear in a Belgian court on 24 March. Abeslam was initially interviewed at 07:00 hours (GMT) on the day after his arrest. He confessed to planning new operations in Brussels and having access to several heavy weapons. A second interview was made on 22 March following the Brussels bombings, as it was believed by some that Abdeslam may have intended to take part in them. Abdeslam claimed he had no prior knowledge of the attacks or anyone who intended to be involved in them. During questioning, Salah Abeslam confirmed that he had rented the cars and hotels used before the attacks, and that he had driven the three suicide bombers who attacked the Stade de France. He stated that his brother Brahim had asked him to become involved in the Paris attacks, and had provided the funds that Salah used to rent the rooms and vehicles for himself and other members of the terrorist cell. In addition, he stated that Brahim gave him a suicide belt in Bobigny. However, he appeared to try to diminish his actual role in the attacks. When presented with a photograph of Ibrahim and Khalid El Bakraoui, two brothers involved in the Brussels bombings, and asked if he knew who they were, he denied knowing them. However, public prosecutors in Belgium stated Ibrahim and Khalid El Bakraoui had provided a safe house for individuals involved in the Paris attacks. In total, Abdeslam was interrogated for less than two hours between the time of his arrest and the Brussel bombings, because \\"[h]e seemed very tired and he had been operated on the day before\\", according to a senior Belgian security official. Sven Mary, Abdeslam's lawyer, reportedly will try to have his sentence reduced on the grounds of his client being willing to act as an informant. The office of the Belgian prosecutor stated that Abdeslam will be transferred to France. Some time after his arrest, Abdeslam was represented by a second lawyer, who reported that his client confirmed his willingness to be transferred, but otherwise refused to speak on any other subject. On 5 April 2016, Mary stated that he had received instructions from the Dutch Brussels Bar Association to cease making any communications to the press regarding Abdeslam, unless he had been given permission to do so by the Associations president. On 21 April 2016, Abdeslam was charged with attempted murder in relation to the shootout during the 15 March police raid that he escaped from. The shootout had left four police officers injured. On 27 April 2016, he was secretly extradited to France and transported to Paris, where he was charged with participating in a terrorist organization, terrorist murder and attempted murder, attempted terrorist murder of public officials, hostage-taking, and weapons and explosives possession. He was imprisoned at Fleury-Mérogis Prison and reappeared in court on 20 May 2016 When he arrived in the prison, other inmates applauded and cheered in support. In October 2016, Abdeslam's lawyers, including Frank Berton, announced they had resigned due to their client, Abdeslam, refusing to speak to them. Participating in a subsequent court hearing on 29 November 2016, Abdeslam refused to speak in court. Because of his continued refusal to speak, Judge Christopher Teissier decided to enter into the record a letter Abdeslam wrote from prison to a fan on 13 November 2016. The letter is considered his first statement to the court. In it, he described himself as \\"a Muslim subject to Allah.\\" Abdeslam reportedly receives \\"incessant\\" mail, with the senders including \\"French and Belgian women who profess their love and want to bear his child\\", as well as offers for legal services. In August 2017, Belgian authorities reportedly wished to have Abdeslam stand trial on the grounds of his alleged involvement in the shooting at police officers during March 2016. In September 2017, Abdeslam wished to aid proceedings in a trial in Brussels, which was set for December. Verdict In a court hearing in Brussels during February 2018, a latest date for a verdict in the trial on the 15 March 2016 Forest (Brussels) shootout was given as being 29 April 2018. Abdeslam and his Tunisian co-defendant Sofien Ayari face 20 years in jail for terror and attempted murder charges. The prosecution found Abdeslam's DNA or fingerprints at five locations in Belgium used by the Brussels ISIL terror cell behind both the November 2015 Paris attacks and 2016 Brussels bombings. Sven Mary, Abdeslam's lawyer, pleads that his client's DNA was not found on the weapons used in the shootout nor did he engage police.julien-boudisseau (8 February 2018) Revivez la deuxième journée du procès de Salah Abdeslam Le Figaro Accessed 9 February 2018James Crisp (8 February 2018) Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam 'must be acquitted' after court papers issued in wrong language the Telegraph Accessed 9 February 2018 On 23 April 2018 Salah Abdeslam was sentenced in Brussels to 20 years in prison after being found guilty of the attempted murder of police officers in a shootout in Brussels in March 2016.

They are located on internal European Union borders, since Austria, Italy, and Slovenia are members of the EU and the free travel Schengen Area with a common visa policy. The barrier on the Slovenian border is several kilometres long, located near the busiest border crossing, Spielfeld-Šentilj, and includes police facilities for screening and processing migrants. Another migration management facility with barriers located on Austria's Italian border near Brenner, South Tyrol was constructed in 2016. History In November 2015, during the European migrant crisis, Austria announced its intention to begin construction of a border barrier on its border with Slovenia. The stated aim of the barrier is to help control the flow of refugees and migrants. Both Austria and Slovenia are within the Schengen Area. The fence will initially be built along at the busiest crossing from Slovenia into Austria, near Spielfeld. According to Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner, the barrier will be 2.2 metres high. However, preparations will be put in place to enable the construction within 48 hours' notice of a fence along a stretch of the border, if needed. Construction began in early November.

Constructed during the Late Woodland period, the mound is the only surviving anthropomorphic effigy mound in North America. The mound depicts a horned humanoid figure and may have held religious or ceremonial significance to its builders. The mound was preserved as a county park in 1908, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016. Description The mound is a large humanoid figure, with its head to the south and its feet originally pointed westward. The figure's head features two horns, which may have been part of a headdress. When it was built, the figure was long and raised from the ground. The legs and feet of the figure were destroyed by the construction of Man Mound Road and a cow pasture across the road, leaving the modern mound roughly shorter than its original length. . The legs have since been repainted across the road, and plastic cutouts of the feet were added to the cow pasture. The mound is one of five anthropomorphic effigy mounds known to exist in North America, all of which were found in Wisconsin, and is the only one which still stands. The other mounds included the La Valle Man Mound, also in Sauk County, and the Eagle Township Man Mound and Twin Man Mounds in neighboring Richland County. A small number of other possible humanoid mounds have been noted, all of them also in southern Wisconsin, though none of these have been confirmed. History The mound was built between 750 and 1200 AD by Late Woodland peoples. It was part of a tradition of effigy mound building which began in 750 and declined in 1000-1200; these effigy mounds were defined by a central zoomorphic or anthropomorphic mound, often surrounded by smaller geometric mounds. The mounds were often used as burial sites and often held religious significance for their builders; while the Man Mound has not been excavated, it has been hypothesized to be a burial site as well, and the figure it represents may have been a shaman or a god. As the mound is still relatively intact, it has significant potential to shed light on the religious and cultural significance of effigy mounds in Late Woodland culture. In 1859, William Canfield became the first European settler to identify and survey the mound. His findings generated some interest due to several ongoing surveys of Wisconsin mounds, but the mound faded from academic attention in the late 19th century. After two of its archaeologists rediscovered the mound, the Wisconsin Archaeological Society worked with the Sauk County Historical Society to purchase the site in 1907. The following year, the two societies designated the mound as a county park to ensure its continued preservation. The mound was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1978, and designated as a National Historic Landmark on October 31, 2016.

Commencement of the siege The Persian siege train had been much improved and augmented since Nader's earlier campaigns as a Safavid general and included hundreds of heavy cannon and mortars. However, due to Nader's illness and impatience with the progression of the siege works, a premature assault was ordered with 40,000 Persian soldiers mounting the city walls using ladders. The city was heavily defended by her Wali Hussain Pasha al-Jalili. The attack was beaten back with heavy casualties. Nader sent a delegation into the city and the garrison commander received them warmly, agreeing to forward their terms to Istanbul and offering gifts to be taken back to the Shah. Istanbul sent a part of plenipotentiaries to negotiate a peace treaty predicated on Nader withdrawing to the border. Conclusion The Persian army lifted the siege of Mosul, although the siege of Basra in the south continued nonetheless. The peace treaty was negotiated and signed by both parties, however, the Ottoman Sultan would later renege on the terms of agreement, thereby sanctioning the resumption of hostilities which eventually led to the Battle of Kars (1745).

The event usually takes place on Easter Sunday or Easter Monday. The map of Polish Easter processions devised by Andrzej Brencz demonstrates that similar processions take place in areas where villages are close to each other. The area where the Easter Greys tradition is observed stretches between Międzychód, Wolsztyn and Poznań in Poland's region of Greater Poland.Andrzej Brencz, Siwki - zwyczajowe pochody przebierańców na Wielkanoc, map and commentary no. 854, in: Atlas Języka i Kultury Ludowej Wielkopolski, t. 11. Poznań: Wydawnictwo Naukowe UAM, 2005, p. 95. The Greys are an example of immaterial cultural heritage of the region.  The origins of the custom and the name  The origins of the custom are not clear: the name suggests parades of grey horses. Siwek in Polish means a grey horse or mare. The procession is named after the Grey Horse – the main character in the procession. In the past, the procession was led by a rider on a grey horse (or a man leading two grey horses). Stanisław Błaszczyk suggested that the horse and the bear are an allegory of departing winter. However, Andrzej Brencz invalidated this theory: the procession takes place in spring only because the time of the celebration has been shifted, as often happens with rituals. It has been proven that similar processions of riders ()In German, Schimmel means \\"gray horse\\". See: Langematz R., Nedo P., Sorbische Volkskunst, Bautzen, 1968, p. 164. on grey horses took place in the region of Pomerania (as mapped by Zofia StaszczakZofia Staszczak, Pogranicze polsko-niemieckie jako pogranicze etnograficzne, map no. 16, Poznań: Wydawnictwo UAM, 1978, pp. 13-14.), as well as in the regions of Warmia and Masuria, except there they took place around Christmas, often on Christmas Eve. Today the people participating in the custom dress up in white clothes and face masks with holes for eyes and mouth, while puppets of horses are tied to their waists. Andrzej Brencz suggests that the ritual refers to old Slavic rituals, connected with the cult of the horse, and supposed to bring good harvest and wealth.Andrzej Brencz, Wielkopolski rok obrzędowy. Tradycja i zmiana. Poznań: Wydawnictwo Poznańskie, 2006, p. 210.  The Greys as celebrated in Chobienice  In Chobienice, the Greys are recalled by the oldest community members, who know the tradition from pre-war sources. A Greys procession had been photographed by the first cameras available in the region. Although the custom's origins differ from those of Western and Central Greater Poland, a number of similarities can be noticed in the procession's line-up and characters' functions. Today this traditional procession draws a crowd of participants, followers, residents and their families. The group has an informal leader, often drawn from the community's leaders: members of the communal council, cultural centre staff, volunteer firefighters or the Farmers' Wives Association members.  The characters  The _Bear_ and the Chimney Sweep, Chobienice, 2015 The procession is composed of various characters – some of them are key figures and are present each spring. Each year those are the greys (usually half a dozen or so), a group of chimney sweeps, the old man and woman, policemen and musicians. = The Bear = The colourful procession borrows motifs from similar carnival events: the bear was traditionally tied with a straw rope, typical for ber, a traditional procession popular across Greater Poland.Andrzej Brencz, Wielkopolski rok obrzędowy. Tradycja i zmiana. Poznań: Wydawnictwo Poznańskie, 2006, pp. 120-122. Today the bear wears fluffy, brown clothes and a mask. A chain is tied around the bear's waist and its jangling alerts residents about the Greys' approach. = The Police Officer = The police officer is another indication of the syncretic way of selecting procession characters: this character resembles the leader of similar żandary parades from Poznań.A. Jarmuż, Poznań, Polska i świat usłyszą o żandarmach, in: Głos Wielkopolski, 11.03.2014, p.4 The police officer leads the procession, marches in the front and chooses the route. Police officers stop cars passing by to give the drivers \\"holiday fines\\" and knock on the doors of nearby houses so the hosts admit the procession and offer the participants some refreshments. The police officer collects donations offered by passers-by, drivers or other people. The person playing this role must be sociable and able to integrate the group and make people laugh. = The Chimney Sweep = A Chimney Sweep smearing a girl's face with tar Chimney sweeps are a popular ludic element and appear every year. Their task has been to smear people with soot (nowadays replaced by shoe polish). It is usually applied with a gloved or naked hand on the targeted person's face, or by pretending to shake hands. In recent years the chimney sweeps have also used whips made from short pieces of rope to whip the legs of the passers-by. These characters enliven the procession and chase the children. The custom of smearing is well known in Polish ethnography – for example, in the customs observed in Greater Poland a similar role is played by Green week procession characters called \\"dirtiers\\" (, lit. tar-makers). Stanisław Błaszczyk observed: “they pelt children with mud, but kids still return to be chased away screaming, only to come back again”.S. Błaszczyk, Wielkopolscy smolarze, in: LUD, Polskie Towarzystwo Ludoznawcze, t. 74, 1991, pp.71-88 = The Grey Horse = Each year there are about half a dozen Greys in Chobienice. The character is dressed up in white clothes, often made from bed linen or a first communion alb. The Greys' heads and necks are covered with white balaclava-like head coverings featuring openings for eyes and mouth. The symbolic horse is the most important element of the outfit. It takes the form of a horse's puppet, made from two plastic hoops and covered with white fabric. The hoops are usually cut out from plastic buckets (earlier – flour sieves). Red accents appear on shoelaces, as mask contour lines, on the top of the balaclava, or as symbolic drawings of a horse's head and tail. One of the roles of the Police Officer is to stop passers-by and fine them with \\"holiday tickets\\". The Greys' task is to chase children and smack passers-by with whips: willow twigs were commonly used for this purpose, which is a reference to the tradition of whipping with green twigs on Easter Monday. Oskar Kolberg mentioned the custom: \\"On the second and third day of Easter in the Chełm region the custom of dyngus, or whipping, takes place... In Michałów and Dobrzyń they do the same, but also spill water over each other. Each of the shepherds walks from house to house and whips others with twigs”.Oskar Kolberg, Dzieła wszystkie, t. 23: Pomorze, Wrocław-Poznań, 1962-1967, p. 66. Andrzej Brencz notes: “Probably the custom of Easter whipping and the other custom of whipping people with twigs on Good Friday are connected to old, ritualized magical rites, which were supposed to transfer the strength of the green twigs to the person being hit with them”.Andrzej Brencz, Wielkopolski rok obrzędowy. Tradycja i zmiana. Poznań: Wydawnictwo Poznańskie, 2006, p. 190. = The Old Man and Old Woman = The old couple is an inseparable pair who carry together a large, wicker, straw-lined basket. The characters' task is to sing and dance for the visited hosts and collect donations into the basket: eggs, alcoholic drinks, sweets. The woman dressed up as the 'old woman' wears strong makeup, since in the past men took this role and the makeup had been a playful way of impersonating the other gender. The old woman's clothes are kitschy and multicoloured, she wears an apron and a headscarf. The old man wears loose clothes and a hat. = The Musicians = The musicians usually – but not always – come from the local community. Dressed in colourful clothes, they march along with the others, sometimes for hours, singing and playing folk or popular melodies. The music had a number of functions: it provided a rhythm for the procession; integrated the procession members with the audience (popular melodies allow the onlookers to feel involved). Finally, it gives a host entertaining the Greys an opportunity to dance or sing.

The character of Siuda Baba is performed by a local man who dresses up as a shabbily clothed woman whose face is blackened with soot. Siuda Baba walks from house to house, accompanied by other characters – a Gypsy and Krakowiacy (men dressed in traditional outfits). The group visits houses, collecting donations and smearing girls' faces with soot.  The custom's origins  The tradition calls upon Slavic spring rites of banishing winter.Barbara Ogrodowska, Zwyczaje, obrzędy i tradycje w Polsce. Warsaw: Verbinum, 2001, p. 190. Legend tells of a pagan temple that once was active near Lednica Górna. The temple stood near a stream in the holy grove on a hill named Kopcowa Góra. Once a year, in early spring, the priestess protecting the holy fire left the temple walls to search for a successor. The girl she chose could not buy herself out; girls would therefore hide wherever they could. Siuda Baba symbolises the priestess; soot is used to blacken Siuda Baba's face, as the priestess was not allowed to wash or leave the temple. Another interpretation suggests the new priestess' face had been blackened to mark her as the successor. The inhabitants of Lednica Górna name different locations for the holy spring and temple: most frequently the sources of the Leda stream.K. Targosz, Korzenie i kształty teatru do 1500 roku w perspektywie Krakowa, Secesja, Kraków, 1995, p. 22. The springs, located in the village, are shrouded in mystery and rarely shown to strangers.Julian Zinkow, Krakowskie podania, legendy i zwyczaje (oraz wybór podań i legend jurajskich). Kraków: Wydawnictwo Platan, 2004, p. 216-218. The custom survived only in villages and towns surrounding Kraków. Christian elements have later been added to the legend, and as a result the Siuda Baba enactment is presented on Easter Monday in Lednica Górna and in the nearby city of Wieliczka. The role of Siuda Baba is performed by a local man who dresses up in rags and blackens his face. He also wears a necklace made of chestnuts or potatoes and a large basket on his back. The same character in Wieliczka carries a large cross in one hand and a soot-dipped whip in the other, and is alone. Siuda Baba walks from house to house accompanied by another man, dressed up as a Gypsy, and four young men wearing traditional Krakowiak costumes, although this requirement is not always met. Siuda Baba (in Wieliczka) or one of the men (in Lednica Górna) is equipped with a cart and collects donations. The group chases passers-by, blackens their faces with soot and sometimes douse them with water.  The ritual  Siuda Baba and the Gypsy get ready to visit local residents A procession of Krakowiacy, Siuda Baba and the Gypsy visiting residents A Siuda Baba procession is made up of eight or six people – young men aged 20–24: six (or four) Krakowiacy, the Gypsy and Siuda Baba. Before they start on their route, preparations are made. The group meets at the Gypsy's home, where they don their costumes: Krakowiacy wear traditional regional folk attire; Siuda Baba – an old, dirty skirt, a necklace made of potatoes, chestnuts, or wooden beads, a scarf used as a pouch for a box with the soot-lotion mixture. The Gypsy wears black trousers with small, black scraps sewn on, a black shirt and hat. The Gypsy's whip is an important accessory: the Gypsy cracks it when entering someone's yard. The faces and palms of both the Gypsy and the Siuda Baba are thoroughly covered with soot. They carry a supply of pre-prepared mix of lotion and soot used for smearing passers-by. The regional costumes worn by Krakowiacy used to be handmade, but since the 1970s have been replaced with factory-made outfits. The current ones have been financed by European Union's rural development funds. The group lugs a cart adorned with a statue of Jesus – a place for donations. The cart is prepared by local girls. The conduct usually follows a pre-planned route and is led by the Gypsy, who usually runs in front to reach the next house as soon as possible. A Siuda Baba's visit begins with the Gypsy cracking his whip. Depending on the level of acquaintance between the visitors and the host, the visit can begin in two ways – if the hosts are close friends, the boys don't hesitate to enter without explicit permission. Whip used by the Gypsy during Easter Siuda Baba celebrations, Lednica Górna 2015 If they go to people they don't know, the Gypsy, after cracking his whip, politely asks the hosts to allow the group to enter. Refusing them might result in minor negative consequences: marking the door handle, mailbox or other household items with the soot/lotion mixture. If the hosts agree for Siuda Baba to enter, the Krakowiacy begin singing. Sometimes the proceedings take place in the yard, on the porch or at the door. After the opening query: \\"Will you receive the resurrected Christ?\\" and if the answer is affirmative, the Krakowiacy sing Easter-themed songs, shaking the cart and the jingles attached to their belts. Then suddenly a line about Siuda Baba is inserted in the song lyrics in an unexpected moment. Suddenly Krakowiacy sing \\"Where's Siuda Baba...\\" and Siuda Baba barges into the house and with the Gypsy's help, smears everyone (especially girls, who should be found first) with the soot mix. The hosts give the departing group a piece of Easter cheesecake or some other refreshment and place some money in the cart. The procession continues until late in the evening. Children and onlookers follow her, shouting:  Siuda Baba celebrations in modern times  Siuda Baba and the Gypsy as handcrafted toys The men who participate in the proceedings are usually aged 20–24 and motivated by the prospect of fun, visiting friends and collecting donations. They follow a number of rules – the roles of characters are clearly defined, the ones participating for the first time usually carry the cart. The Gypsy is often a hereditary role and the secret of manufacturing the whip is passed down the generations, as is the skill to crack it well. Only unmarried men can be members of the Siuda Baba procession. When an older brother, who performed the role of Gypsy gets married, the younger brother inherits the role and learns how to crack the whip. Due to population migration, some of the new inhabitants of Lednica Górna are unfamiliar with the ritual. Some are very enthusiastic when visited by a Siuda conduct, treating it as a tourist attraction; others clearly dislike it and do not open the door. Local residents who are well acquainted with the tradition believe that having one's face blackened by Siuda Baba brings good luck for the coming year; a smeared girl may expect to get married soon. Anyone spotted attempting to clean the soot off will be smeared again. \\"Ledniczanie\\" – the Lednica Górna Association – supports the tradition and encourages young people to keep it alive. Siuda Baba is the symbol of Lednica Górna and frequently appears on local handmade items.

It lasted from October 1869 until a formal peace accord was signed on 11 January 1870. The rebels managed to defeat the Austro-Hungarian army detachments sent against them and in the end the government conceded on all points of dispute. In 1869 it was announced that conscription, in accordance with the Wehrgesetz (Defence Act) of 1868, would be extended to the Krivošije, a tribe and its mountainous region in the north of the Kotor district, the southernmost district of the Kingdom of Dalmatia, north of the Bay of Kotor. The region had been under Austrian rule since 1814. The local population was Serb, Orthodox and tribal. Although the men traditionally bore arms and some had volunteered in the Austrian Navy—there being a major naval base at Kotor—they had never been obligated to serve in the army. Despite the opposition raised by the new order, in his initial reports the Dalmatian governor, Feldmarschalleutnant Johann Ritter von Wagner, insisted that the situation was under control. In September, he ordered the population disarmed and conscription enforced. Immediately fighting broke out between his troops and the tribesmen. On October 7, in order \\"not [to] besmirch the honor of our arms or damage the prestige of the government\\", Wagner asked for reinforcements. With help from their compatriots in independent Montenegro and some bands from Ottoman Herzegovina, the Krivošije rebels defeated the first detachments sent against them. By November, the number of Austro-Hungarian battalions in the field had increased from five to eighteen. Artillery had been brought up and a naval squadron lay offshore. Because the Kotor district was cut off from the rest of the empire by Ottoman Sutorina, and because of the poor state of its roads, the Austro-Hungarian navy had the large task of ferrying all 10,000 reinforcements. The Krivošije rebels were only about 1,000 in number. The inspector-general, Archduke Albrecht, blamed the \\"colossal\\" blunders of Wagner for the failure to subdue the insurgents. In December, a meeting of the Common Ministerial Council (the Austro-Hungarian cabinet) was held to discuss the problem. The Minister of War, Franz Kuhn von Kuhnenfeld, downplayed it, believing the troops could \\"deal with a few hundred bandits\\", while Feldzeugmeister Gavrilo Rodić and the Chef der Militärkanzlei, Friedrich von Beck-Rzikowsky, urged a compromise with the rebels, support for whom was increasing in other south Slavic areas. Rodić suggested that Wagner be dismissed and that he himself replace him with the discretionary power to grant an amnesty. This was done and, on 11 January 1870, a peace treaty was signed at Knežlaz. The rebels surrendered to General Rodić and were allowed to keep their weapons. Conscription was abandoned and a general pardon was granted to all insurgents. The result of the uprising was an embarrassing setback for the Austro-Hungarian government. The Compromise of 1867 with the Hungarians was \\"widely considered as a sell-out of the South Slavs\\" and the Krivošije revolt engendered sympathy among the empire's Croats. Beck was convinced that the rebels were encouraged by foreign elements. Friedrich von Beust, Chairman of the Ministerial Council, blamed the Italians for smuggling arms to the rebels, although no evidence of such trans-Adriatic shipments was ever found. During the uprising, an article was published in Italy urging the annexation of Albania, which did little to allay Austria-Hungary's concerns. In 1881, after the incorporation of Bosnia and Herzegovina into Austria- Hungary in 1878, the government introduced conscription into the new provinces and renewed its claims in Krivošije. This provoked a new uprising which quickly spilled over into the new provinces. This was perhaps the intention: to create an opportunity to remove the stain of the defeat of 1869.

PlotProduction Méliès, acting in a wig and false beard, appears in the film as the photographer. The photography studio set, constructed from a painted backdrop and a wooden flat, closely reproduces the typical architecture of a contemporary photographer's studio; Méliès had drawn upon many elements of this architecture, including the use of a shuttered glass ceiling, in designing his film studio. The small statue of a dancer had previously been used in his 1904 film The Ballet-Master's Dream, while the lamppost prop was recycled from his 1905 film Unexpected Fireworks. The posters on the outside wall, ostensibly campaigning for political candidates, are in fact private jokes: the candidates' names are given as \\"Claudel\\", the name of Méliès's set painter; \\"L. Micho\\", i.e. Méliès's cameraman Michaut; and \\"Salmon\\", the name of an actor at Méliès's studio. Close watching of the scene when the camera falls reveals that the prop camera had difficulty fitting through the window: Méliès, in character as the photographer, had to push it. Substitution splices are also in evidence in the film. Themes Méliès's characterization of his role reflects a common depiction of professional photographers as mercenary salespeople. The janitor \\"becoming\\" a bull is the comic centerpiece of the film, with the staging of the scene designed to parody a bullfight. The chain-reaction of the fall itself also contributes to the comic nature of the film. With its juxtaposition of artificiality (in the photographer's posed shots) and realism (in the urban action outside), culminating in the comic bullfight in which the two are inextricably blended, the film may be a satirical comment on the naturalistic actuality films made by the Lumière brothers and other early filmmakers. Méliès himself made many actuality films early in his career—all told, 93 films, or 18% of his output, were filmed as actuality material—but he gradually abandoned the genre in favor of more innovative fiction-based films. Release and reception A Mix- up in the Gallery was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 789–790 in its catalogues. The film was deposited at the Library of Congress for American copyright on 21 February 1906. Brian Jacobson, in a study of early film studio architecture, argues that the film displays a \\"canny awareness of the changing qualities of modern spaces and materials\\", including a mise en abyme in which the photography studio stands in for Méliès's own film studio.

It was established in Champaign, IL in 1923. Today the organization serves around 3,500 Jewish students and their peers at The University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign and Parkland College. History Hillel: it was created in 1990 The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life was founded at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1923. In 1921, a small group of college students at the University of Illinois came together under the wing of a local rabbinic student named Benjamin Frankel. The 24-year-old, who was interning at Temple Sinai in Champaign, described his Jewish peers as being in a state of \\"intellectual flux.\\" As the children of recent Jewish immigrants, many were struggling to strike a balance between being American and being Jewish. Mrs. Hattie Kauffman, a prominent woman in the local Jewish community, encouraged Benjamin Frankel to reside in Champaign-Urbana as Sinai's part-time rabbi.Sinai Temple He accepted this part-time pulpit and a small stipend to remain in the area. Frankel worked closely with the university's Jewish student population of approximately 300 students to strengthen their dual identities. Frankel proceeded to organize the foundation with no financial support at first, beside his modest salary he received from Sinai. When he was ordained in 1923, the group began meeting more formally – in a rented room above a barbershop on the south side of the 600 block of East Green Street in Champaign.Sinai Temple Rabbi Frankel and his students were ready to expand but they needed resources... and a name. Frankel reached out to the local B'nai B'rith for support and campus leaders started to pay attention. In 1924, Frankel attended the national B'nai B'rith convention to appeal support for Hillel. Edward Chauncey Baldwin, a non-Jewish professor of English at the university, famously challenged Chicago Jewish leader Rabbi Louis Mann, asking: \\"Don't you think the time has come when a Jewish student might educate his mind without losing his soul?\\" From there, Frankel, Baldwin and Mann began working together and their fundraising efforts quickly developed the part-time student program into a full-time organization. Impressively, the men raised the entire first-year budget – $12,000 – in a single luncheon. The as-yet- unnamed Hillel was off and running. It didn't take long for Frankel and a board of lay leaders to assign the name Hillel, a tribute to one of Judaism's greatest teachers. One year after agreeing to take the foundation under its wing, B'nai B'rith allocated $1 million for the expansion of Hillel throughout the country. Frankel was appointed as Hillel's first national director. The social impact of Hillel was felt on the University of Illinois campus soon after the foundation's creation. Only 100 of 350 Jewish college students in 1923 were willing to identify as Jews during fall registration. In 1928, a mere four years later, almost all of the 650 Jewish students enrolled identified themselves as such.Sinai Temple Rabbi Frankel's friend and successor, Dr. Abram L. Sachar, came to Champaign-Urbana in 1923. Until his resignation in 1929, Dr. Sachar served in the History department at the University of Illinois, specializing in modern English history. During that time, he also served as faculty advisor in Hillel and obtained a license to perform marriages at Sinai Temple and Hillel, because he was not an ordained rabbi. In February 1928, Dr. Sachar became permanent director of the Illinois Hillel chapter. In 1933, he became the first full-time national director, and continued until 1947. Under his leadership, Hillel grew from 9 chapters to 157 chapters throughout the United States and Canada.Sinai Temple By the time of his tragic and untimely death in 1929 at age 30, Rabbi Frankel had helped establish chapters at University of Wisconsin, The Ohio State University, University of Michigan, University of Southern California, and Cornell University, as well as the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Today, Illini Hillel serves approximately 3,000 Jewish undergraduate and 500 graduate students. Building From 1923 until 1950, Hillel used several buildings to host programs and events. Those same buildings served not only as the home of the UI Hillel, but as the national Hillel headquarters as well. The first building built solely for Hillel, designed by Max Abramovitz, the architect who designed the Assembly Hall and Krannert Center for the Performing Arts on campus, was erected in 1950–1951. After construction, the building was named the Benjamin Frankel Memorial in honor of the late Rabbi Frankel, who was the first director of the local Hillel Foundation. Among those attending the building's dedication was the former first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. The building was well-equipped to provide event opportunities to the Jewish student community, as the old building seated 100 for religious services in the chapel and the auditorium accommodated 300 for lectures, dramatics, social gatherings, and recreation. The library, seminar rooms, and social rooms were used by both students and the community. Kitchens were included, as well as the caretaker's and administrative suites. To cater to the student's needs, the original Hillel Foundation offered more than twenty courses, for both graduate and undergraduate students, concentrating in Hebrew studies and Jewish culture and society. After talks of expanding and building renovation, Hillel's new facility: The Margie K. and Louis N. Cohen Center for Jewish Life, opened on December 4, 2007. The state-of-the-art building, designed by the Chicago firm of Amstadter Architects, has 800 more square feet than the old building. The Margie K. and Louis N. Cohen Center for Jewish Life includes a large and comfortable student lounge, an upper level deck for BBQs and the Hillel Sukkah, Wireless internet access, dairy and meat Kosher kitchens, drop- in coffee bar and program space of varying sizes. On May 15, 2018, the Champaign City Council unanimously approved putting up an honorary street name on the John street block between 5th and 6th street, where Hillel's buildings have been standing since 1949. The Honorary Rabbi Ben Frankel Way sign was installed on July 7, 2018 and will remain up for 10 years. Mission Hillel's mission is to enrich the lives of Jewish undergraduate and graduate students so that they may enrich the Jewish people and the world. Hillel seeks to create a pluralistic, welcoming and inclusive environment for Jewish college students: an environment where students are encouraged to grow intellectually, spiritually and socially. Hillel helps students find their own balance in being distinctively Jewish and universally human. It does this by providing opportunities to pursue tzedek (social justice); helping students to engage with critical Jewish issues in the US, Israel and around the world through experiences in Israel, Eastern Europe and helping to \\"repair the world\\" (tikkun olam). Hillel encourages Jewish learning and celebration and provides students with an opportunity to explore culture and the arts. Hillel creates a variety of ways that students can advocate for and support Jews in Israel and around the world. Hillel seeks to inspire every Jewish student to find their own approach to making an enduring commitment to Jewish life.

Friday evenings are a particularly special time at Hillel. Following the separate Reform, Conservative and Orthodox minyanim, the community comes together for a traditional Shabbat meal. Saturday mornings provide another opportunity for students to pray with minyanim. Hillel's Conservative community, also known as the Jewish U of I Conservative Egalitarian (JUICE), offers 3–4 Saturday minyans per semester. Hillel's Orthodox Minyan is offered daily at Hillel. On Saturday afternoons, free kosher lunch is offered to all students and in the evening, Hillel hosts a free kosher dinner for the third meal, following which students sing seuda shlishit songs. One of Illini Hillel's most beloved weekly programs is Sandy's Bagel Brunch. From 11am-1pm every Sunday, students come together for bagels, lox, cream cheese, coffee cake, and orange juice to recharge for the week ahead. The Bagel Brunch has been named in memory of Sanford \\"Sandy\\" Takiff, who served on the boards of the Chicago Bulls and White Sox. In addition to these standard weekly programs, Hillel offers many other opportunities for students to get involved. Illini Public Affairs Committee, or IlliniPAC, is a student organization focused on strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship through education and advocacy. They work closely on lobbying and working with up and coming leaders on campus and in the local community. Illini Students Supporting Israel (ISSI) is an organization for Israel-related dialogue, engagement, and education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ISSI seeks to accomplish these goals though discussions, speakers, and innovative, student-run programs. Every summer break and winter break, Hillel also sends a group of University of Illinois students on a Taglit-Birthright Israel trip. This free, 10-day trip sends Jewish students ages 18–26 to Israel for the first time. Illini Hillel works closely with the organization, Shorashim, to connect students to Israeli participants for the entire 10-day trip.

The 1936 county highway map showed a church, a cemetery, an industrial site, several other businesses, and numerous homes in the community. Only one business was reported in the community in 1987. In the first quarter of the 20th century, Mendoza had a population of 200 residents. During the Great Depression, its population fell to 100, and remained at that number until the mid-1960s when it dropped to 50 residents. It was that same number in 1990, and grew back to 100 in 2000. Geography Mendoza is located on U.S. Route 183 north of Lockhart in the north central part of Caldwell County. Education In 1905, Mendoza had a school with one teacher and 47 students. It also had a school featured on the 1936 county highway map.

The school population continued to increase in size along with the parish, so in 1910 two-story cream brick addition was added to the back of the building, designed by Herman J. Esser.

Daughtry was an outfielder in the minor-league system of the Seattle Mariners organization between 1987 and 1989. Shortly after returning to Brooklyn in 1990 with the hopes of pursuing a law enforcement career, Daughtry was arrested in connection with a shooting in which a bullet fatally struck a nine-year-old girl. Convicted of manslaughter, Daughtry was imprisoned until he was granted parole in 2005. Early life Daughtry was born in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School, located in a rough part of Brooklyn, graduating in 1986. He then attended Miami-Dade College and then Kingsborough Community College, where he studied criminology. In college, he attracted the attention of scouts from the Seattle Mariners. Professional baseball career He was drafted by the Seattle Mariners as the first pick in the 19th round of the 1987 Major League Baseball Draft, one selection ahead of future major league pitcher Mike Fyhrie. He was signed by scout Joe Nigro. He played in the minor leagues from 1987 to 1989 for the Bellingham Mariners (1987–89) and San Bernardino Spirit (1989).

Rather than continuing in professional baseball, he hoped to pursue a law enforcement career like his sister, an officer in the 77th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. In the meantime, he worked as a security officer and as an employee at a home for the developmentally disabled. On July 22, 1990, for reasons that were not initially clear, Daughtry fired bullets several bullets on a Brooklyn street. One of the bullets went through a car door and hit a sleeping nine-year-old girl, Veronica Corales, in the head. The child later died at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center. Police and prosecutors said that Daughtry had yelled toward a group of people before the shooting, and that one of those people was a man with whom he had an unsettled argument. Bystanders attempted to subdue the gunman after the shooting, but he got away. Daughtry later turned himself in. At trial, Daughtry's attorney said that his client did not have a firearm and that police had pursued the wrong suspect. Daughtry was acquitted of murder, but he was found guilty of manslaughter and first-degree reckless endangerment.Hevesi, Dennis (June 16, 1991).

Since mid-19th century the ritual has become a part of Midsummer Eve, Whit Sunday or Corpus Christi celebrations. After all the residents have gathered, the village elder and village council publicly condemned the captured kite, blaming it for evil deeds, and sentenced it to death by beheading. Whenever a kite could not be captured alive, a hen or a crow could be used instead.  The Ritual  The ritual had most likely been meant as a warning, since the village elder reading the sentence would always allude to current events in the village and warn his people that doing the same deeds for which the kite was punished might bring similar punishment. The kite's bad reputation might be related to the fact that it is a bird of prey and was known for decimating poultry. Another hypothesis suggests that the bird was a harbinger of drought, since its cry was similar to the words \\"pi, pi\\" which mean \\"drink, drink\\" (cf. ). To prevent this disaster, the bird had to be killed. Nowadays the beheading of a kite is a public event, and an effigy is used instead of a live kite. Occasionally the bird is replaced with a red flower.  Name and origins  The Executioner is supposed to behead the kite with three blows. The red kite (Milvus milvus) is a medium-large bird of prey in the hawks and eagles family, Accipitridae. Although found across Poland, it is relatively the commonest in the Pomerania region. The bird feeds on small rodents, frogs, young and infirm birds and carrion. The kite's cry resembles \\"hee-ye\\".Piotr Schamndt: Sobótka, ścinanie kani, ogień i czary na Kaszubach. Gdynia: 2014, s. 25-27. Kashubian folk tradition considered the bird to be antagonistic towards humans and their possessions; it was also associated with laziness. If a kite couldn't be procured for the ritual, a hen or a crow would be used instead. Today in Polish villages (e.g. in Łączyńska Huta) the kite is symbolized by an effigy stuffed with feathers. The ritual was first mentioned in an 1851 text by Florian Ceynowa, who described the custom as it was in his home village. Also Jan Patock writes about the ritual in Dzień św. Jana na Kaszubach [St. John's Day in the Kashubia region] (1932).Jan Rompski: Ścinanie kani. Kaszubski zwyczaj ludowy.. Toruń: 1973, s. s. 35. Today the custom takes place in summer, usually in June. Local activists, actors and volunteers perform in a number of Kashubian villages (Łączyńska Huta, Wdzydze Kiszewskie, Szymbark, Strzelno). Red kite, the name-sake of the ritual There are several legends concerning the rite's origins: * Dr. Bernard Sychta, in Zbiór podań, opowieści i baśni kaszubskich [A collection of Kashubian tales and fables]Bernard Sychta. Zbiór podań, opowieści i legend kaszubskich. \\"Lud\\". 8:19. s. 280. writes about drought in the region so severe that lakes and rivers had dried out. God took pity on the birds dying of thirst and ordered them to dig wells. When all the birds began the work, the kite refused because it didn't want to get dirt on its legs. For this deed, the bird was punished and since then it can only drink water droplets from cracks in stones. * In the northern part of the region the kite was identified with a woman: a local tale related to this belief is about Christ travelling with St. Peter and asking a woman for some water. When she refused to share it, she was punished by being turned into the bird. * A story from the Kościerzyna area explains that the kite is an enchanted wizard, who possessed great knowledge and treasures. His spells stopped rains in the region. When he had been transformed into the kite, he was allowed to drink water only from cracks in stones. In summer he is very thirsty and cries: \\"pi, pi\\" which means \\"drink, drink\\".  Characters  Individual roles are assigned randomly by drawing lots or asking for volunteers (before or on the ritual day) and assigning the following roles: * The Village Leader and his wife: Village leaders are usually the show's organisers – they are supposed to welcome and say goodbye to the guests. The leader announces the death sentence; he wears a hat adorned with flowers and ribbons. Together with the Executioner they are the most distinctive characters of the event. * The Executioner and his wife: The Executioner beheads the kite, sometimes also announces the sentence. He wears red (sometimes white or black) clothes. He is armed with a sabre. * The Judge and his wife: The Judge only appeared in the early 20th century. During the ritual the Judge demands information about the characters and the conduct of the other characters' wives. He wears white robes, sometimes with a cape. A chain made from gilded paper hangs around his neck. * The Hunter and his wife: The Hunter is responsible for catching the kite and tying it to the pole. The Dog Catcher and the Hunter are sometimes described as the Executioner's help. * The Game Warden and his wife: Helps the Hunter. * The Dog Catcher and his wife: The Dog Catcher removes the dead kite. In some variations he may be replaced with the Digger and the Carrier with stretches. * The Jew: A character wearing typical Jewish clothes, carrying a bag of cats on his back. He provides comic relief towards the ritual's end.  The course of the ritual  The original tradition was upheld until the 19th century. After Florian Ceynowa's publications in the mid 19th century (two articles in \\"Nadwiślanin\\" magazine), the ritual was resurrected by activists, members of pro-Kashubian organizations, employees of ethnographic and open-air museums. Today the tradition is based on Edmund Kamiński's text found in Jan Rompski's \\"Ścinanie kani. Kaszubski zwyczaj ludowy\\" [Beheading a kite. A Kashubian folk tradition]. The ritual usually takes place on a meadow, possibly near water. A podium decorated with plants is placed there. Local women bring high men's hats decorated with colorful strings. Each woman aims for her hat to be the prettiest. The hats are to be worn by the future \\"husbands\\" during the ritual. A pole to which the kite will be tied is placed in the centre. The village leader or the executioner begin to circle around the pole, driving the audience away with a sabre to make room. Then, wives are selected for the actors. Women approach a box with tickets and draw one, and the selection is confirmed by the village leader. Having selected the husbands, the women form a circle and sing together. The village leader gives a speech; this is a solemn moment. The executioner accuses the kite of various crimes and the judgement begins. The prosecutor – village leader – points out all the crimes the kite had committed. In addition to the damage done to poultry and cattle, there are also allusions to young women. The village leader addresses the community and pronounces the kite guilty of all the sins, and sentences it to death. The people applaud. After securing an agreement to proceed with the execution, the executioner attempts to kill the kite with three strikes (the Executioner who does not manage to kill the kite with up to three strikes will be laughed at). The Executioner wraps the beheaded bird and its head in white cloth and carries it to a grave, where the catcher buries it. Finally the village leader thanks the audience for attending; the actors and all participants make a bonfire and celebrate.

It is a third- generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Osimertinib was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2015, and in the European Union in February 2016. Medical uses Osimertinib is used to treat locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), if the cancer cells are positive for the T790M mutation in the gene coding for EGFR or for activating EGFR mutations. The T790M mutation may be de novo or acquired following first-line treatment with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and afatinib. In the US, EGFR exon 19 deletions, exon 21 L858R mutations or the T790M status of the patient prior to treatment with osimertinib must be detected by a federally approved companion diagnostic test. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved FoundationOne CDx as one available companion diagnostic test for this purpose. In Europe and elsewhere, activating EGFR mutations or T790M mutations may be determined by a validated test. In people treated with osimertinib, resistance usually develops within approximately 10 months. Resistance mediated by an exon 20 C797S mutation accounts for the majority of resistance cases. It can cause fetal harm, so should not be used in women who are pregnant, and women who take it should avoid becoming pregnant. Caution should be taken in people with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), as they were excluded from clinical trials, since the drug can cause severe ILD or pneumonitis. Caution should also be taken in people with a predisposition to long QT syndrome as the drug can provoke this. Adverse effects  Very common (greater than 10% of clinical trial subjects) adverse effects include diarrhea, stomatitis, rashes, dry or itchy skin, infections where finger or toenails abut skin, low platelet counts, low leukocyte counts, and low neutrophil counts. Common (between 1% and 10% of clinical trial subjects) adverse effects include interstitial lung disease.  Interactions  Osimertinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, so substances that strongly inhibit either enzyme, like macrolide antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals may increase exposure to osimertinib, and substances like rifampicin that activate either enzyme may decrease the effectiveness of osimertinib. Pharmacology Osimertinib binds irreversibly to epidermal growth factor receptor proteins expressed by EGFR with a T790M mutation; it also binds irreversibly to EGFR with a L858R mutation and with an exon 19 deletion. It exhibits linear pharmacokinetics; the median time to Cmax is 6 hours (range 3–24 hours). The estimated mean half-life is 48 hours, and oral clearance (CL/F) is 14.3 (L/h). 68% of elimination is by feces and 14% by urine. Chemistry Osimertinib is provided as the mesylate; the chemical formula is C28H33N7O2·CH4O3S, and the molecular weight is 596 g/mol. The chemical name is N-(2-{2-dimethylaminoethyl- methylamino}-4-methoxy-5-{[4-(1-methylindol-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl]amino}phenyl)prop-2-enamide mesylate salt. History The drug discovery program that led to osimertinib started in 2009 and yielded the drug by 2012; the process was structure-driven and aimed to find a third generation EGFR inhibitor that would selectively target the T790M form of the EGFR receptor. Osimertinib was designated as a Breakthrough Therapy in April 2014, based on Phase I trial results, and the drug was provisionally approved under the FDA accelerated approval program with a priority review voucher, in November 2015. In February 2016, the EMA provisionally approved osimertinib under an accelerated process—the first approval under the program.

Deterioration of frescoes  Hades abducting Persephone Frescoes can be found in places of worship such as churches, ancient temples and tombs, as well as private residences and commercial establishments used for public entertainment. It is these environments and their pollutants that interact with the chemicals, both organic and inorganic, utilized to create the frescoes and the pigments used that contribute to their aesthetic and structural deterioration. Additionally, wall paintings such as frescoes depending on the technique used, possess a layered structure consisting of support, ground or paint layer. These constituents of wall paintings undergo deterioration physically, chemically or biologically. Although factors like moisture, salts, and atmospheric pollution have generally been the main contributors to the deterioration of wall paintings in most cases, many in the field believe the growth of biological agencies like fungi and microbial flora is also responsible for decay.  Chemical degradation  The presence of pigment discoloration, stains and the formation of bio-film are indicative of chemical degradation. Given the variety of organic and inorganic molecules present in frescoes, many type of micro-organisms may grow on the substrate of the fresco provided that environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, light, and pH) are fostered. Chemical deterioration can be attributed to fungi through their metabolites either by assimilation or dissimulation processes. In the assimilation process, the fungi use the components of frescoes as a carbon source through enzyme production, whereas in the dissimulation process, the decay is mainly by the excretion of waste products or secretion of metabolic intermediates including acids and pigments which can damage, stain or disfigure the surface. Physical degradation Fresco in the terrace houses in Ephesus Signs of cracking and disintegration of paint layers and the formation of paint blisters is indicative of physical/structural degradation. Industrial pollutants contain gases and burning fossil fuels which react with oxygen and water to produce sulfuric acid and nitric acids. These acids convert calcium carbonate (limestone) to calcium sulfate which becomes soluble in the water and it forms large crystals within the surface layer causing the fresco to blister and flake off.Gardinali, Piero R. \\"Chemistry and Fresco Painting\\". Florida International University. Retrieved 19 November 2015. Aside from the adverse effects of environmental pollutants, fungal growth either on or below the surface can cause the dislodging of the paint layers further contributing to the physical and structural degradation of frescoes.  Preventive care  Frescoes that have been removed from their original context and relocated to cultural institutions have the benefit of being in a more stable environment that is consistently monitored, even though they are at low risk. However, for frescoes still at their place of origin, such as cultural heritage sites, are at high risk because they are vulnerable to environmental elements due to a high volume of tourist traffic in conjunction with other pollutants. Therefore, as with any similar object, data loggers are useful to monitor ambient conditions such as temperature and relative humidity, as well as thermohygrometric sensors for micro-climate monitoring for fresco paintings in indoor, outdoor or semi-confined environments.  Cleaning methods  Cleaning aims to restore artworks to how the artist intended them to look; however, how an artwork is cleaned will depend on the nature of the material to be removed. With paintings, a variety of organic solvents are used, but the most common solvent is water, often with chelating agents, surfactants or salts to control pH. Applying solutions through tissues, gels and sponges is becoming the norm, due to the level of control offered by holding the cleaning system at the upper surface of the art. Such gels, introduced in the late 1980s, are usually water-based emulsions thickened with cellulose or synthetic polymers. By slowly releasing the solvent, they prevent some of the swelling damage that free solvents cause to paint layers. During the 1960s, it became popular to use synthetic polymers to consolidate and stabilise frescoes – plaster-based wall paintings. They seemed like the perfect replacement for the wax coatings previously used, but over time it became clear that this was not the case. Their presence drastically changed the paintings’ surface properties, causing mechanical stresses and crystallisation of salts beneath the painting leading to accelerated disintegration. In addition, the polymers themselves became discoloured and brittle. By the mid-1990s, laser cleaning was established for stone and started to be used for other materials such as gilded bronzes and frescoes. A major breakthrough came when an Italian physicist at the National Research Council Institute of Applied Physics in Florence, Salvatore Siano, developed a method that used even shorter pulses, of only micro- to nanosecond duration. Another major innovation in the last decade is the use of colloid science and nanotechnology in conservation. In the mid 1990s colloid scientist Piero Baglioni came up with a microemulsion: a clear mixture of organic solvent and water, stabilised with a surfactant that sits at the interface between the water and organic phases. Another unusual method of cleaning frescoes is with the use of specific types of bacteria to remove inorganic crusts and animal glues from frescoes. Because bacteria can produce a whole host of enzymes they can deal with complex cleaning problems, metabolising organic and inorganic matter into hydrogen sulfide, molecular nitrogen or carbon dioxide.  Repair and restoration techniques  IMG 6172 - MI - Sant'Eustorgio - Sottocoro - Restauratrice - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 1-Mar-2007 During the 18th century, new techniques were perfected for the restoration and conservation of ancient works of art, including methods of detaching fresco paintings from walls. Detachment involves separating the layer of paint from its natural backing, generally stone or brick, and can be categorized according to the removal technique used. The oldest method, known as the a massello technique, involves cutting the wall and removing a considerable part of it together with both layers of plaster and the fresco painting itself. The stacco technique, on the other hand, involves removing only the preparatory layer of plaster, called the arriccio together with the painted surface. Finally, the strappo technique, without doubt the least invasive, involves removing only the topmost layer of plaster, known as the intonachino, which has absorbed the pigments, without touching the underlying arriccio layer. In this method, a protective covering made from strips of cotton and animal glue is applied to the painted surface. A second, much heavier cloth, larger than the painted area, is then laid on top and a deep incision is made in the wall around the edges of the fresco. A rubber mallet is used to repeatedly strike the fresco so that it detaches from the wall. Using a removal tool, a sort of awl, the painting and the intonachino attached to the cloth and glue covering are then detached, from the bottom up. The back of the fresco is thinned to remove excess lime and reconstructed with a permanent backing made from two thin cotton cloths, called velatini, and a heavier cloth with a layer of glue. Two layers of mortar are then applied; first a rough one and then a smoother, more compact layer. The mortars make up the first real layer of the new backing. The velatini cloths and the heavier cloth serve only to facilitate future detachments, and are therefore known as the strato di sacrificio, or sacrificial layer. Once the mortar is dry, a layer of adhesive is applied and the fresco is attached to a rigid support made from synthetic material which can be used to reconstruct the architecture that originally housed the fresco. After the backing has completely dried, the cloth covering used to protect the front of the fresco during detachment is removed using a hot water spray and decoloured ethyl alcohol. Piero Baglioni has also pioneered the use of nanoparticles for repairing deteriorating frescoes. Artists generally painted directly onto wet calcium hydroxide plaster, which reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate (calcite). Over centuries, pollution and humidity causes the carbonate layer to break down and sulfate, nitrate and chloride salts within the walls recrystallize, leading to deterioration of the painted surface. Baglioni was sure that nanoparticles would improve on conventional conservation methods. His treatment injects calcium hydroxide nanoparticles dispersed in alcohol and their small size, just 10–100 nm, allows them to penetrate several centimetres into the frescoes and slowly reform the depleted calcite. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin can be used to treat strains of bacteria living in a fresco's natural pigment which can turn them into powder. Another method of fresco repair is the application of a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses, and the wall and pictorial layer are strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with lime putty and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.  Fresco restoration projects  The Sistine Chapel  Sistine Chapel  The Sistine Chapel was restored in the late 1970s and through the 1980s. This was one of the most significant, largest and longest art restoration projects in history. The entire project took twelve years to complete, not taking into account the inspections, planning and approval of the project. Among the many parts of the chapel that was restored, what drew the most attention were Michelangelo's frescoes. The restoration sparked controversy. A number of experts criticized the proposed techniques, claiming that the restoration procedure would scrape off the layers of various materials on the frescoes, which would lead to damage beyond repair, and that the removal of the materials would expose the pigments on the frescoes which were fragile and dated to artificial light, temperature variations, humidity and pollution. Such exposure, they feared, would cause massive damage to the original artwork. Villa of Mysteries in Pompeii Fresque des mytères, Pompéi For the frescos of Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii, early conservation efforts sometimes involved removing frescoes, rebuilding or reinforcing the walls, and then reattaching the paintings. The first conservators also applied a coat of wax mixed with oil to clean the paintings’ surfaces, preserve the ancient pigments, and stabilize the fragile works, giving the frescoes a glossy appearance the ancient artists never intended them to have. At the same time, the wax filled in cracks in the surfaces, sealing moisture inside the walls, further weakening them by compromising the strength of the mortar holding the walls together. By 2013 the villa, like most of Pompeii, was in dire need of modern conservation, as was a protective covering that had been constructed in different phases throughout the years. Parts of paintings were crumbling from unstable walls and the mosaics had been severely damaged by millions of visitors’ feet. Repeated applications of wax had caused the pigments to oxidize and darken, and the frescoes to yellow, significantly altering their appearance. All the surface decorations of the villa, both mosaics and frescoes, had been conserved before, but in irregular ways. Some of the methods currently being employed have been used by decades of conservators at Pompeii. Frescoes have been cleaned by hand using a scalpel or a chemical solution. Painted surfaces have been consolidated with an acrylic resin diluted with deionized water and then injected into cracks, as well as the use of antibiotics for the removal of bacteria. The teams today also have more high-tech tools at their disposal, including lasers to clean the frescoes, and ultrasound, thermal imaging, and radar to evaluate the level of decay of the walls and paintings. Drones are being used to examine the entirety of the villa's protective covering.

Barta (2015). \\"Revisiting Sabath's \\"Larger Avian Eggs\\" from the Gobi Cretaceous\\" Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 60(1):11-25. History The eggs of Styloolithus were first discovered in 1991 by Karol Sabath in an assemblage of fossil eggs in the Gobi desert, and were described as \\"larger avian eggs\\".Sabath, K. (1991). \\"Upper Cretaceous amniotic eggs from the Gobi Desert\\". Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 36: 151–192. They were considered classified as Gobioolithus major in 1996 by Mikhailov. In 2015, Varracchio and Barta redefined G. major, and reclassified the \\"larger avian eggs\\" into an entirely new oogenus, Styloolithus. Description Styloolithus egg next to two Gobioolithus The type specimen of Styloolithus is a fossil clutch of at least four eggs and associated adult remains (probably representing the parent). Several other fossil eggs are also known. The egg clutches are tightly packed together, like Prismatoolithus and Troodontid eggs, in contrast to the loosely scattered nests of enantiornithine birds. However, the eggs themselves are quite different from Troodontids, and the associated skeletal remains are similar to the enantiornithine Gobipteryx minuta (=Nanantius valifanovi). S. sabathi eggs are quite different from all other known fossil eggs of the Cretaceous. At 70 mm long and 32 mm across, they are larger than both oospecies of Gobioolithus, and more elongated. It can be distinguished from all non-avian dinosaur eggs by the thick third layer of the shell (possibly representing an external zone). It lacks shell ornamentation, unlike Elongatoolithus and Macroelongatoolithus. The eggs are interesting because of the possible presence of an external zone, the outer layer of the eggshell which is rare outside of bird eggs. Laura E. Wilson, Karen Chin, Frankie D. Jackson, and Emily S. Bray. II. Eggshell morphology and structure. UCMP Online Exhibits: Fossil Eggshell If correctly interpreted, this would prove that Styloolithus in fact represents bird eggs. However, it cannot be proven to have an external layer until its shell is examined by scanning electron microscopy. Parataxonomy When they were first discovered in 1991, Styloolithus eggs (then unnamed) were described as bird eggs. The three phylogenetic analyses performed by Varracchio and Barta (2015) were inconclusive as to whether it represented a bird or a non-avian theropod. However, it is most likely avian because it has an unornamented, thin shell that probably has three structural layers, a combination of characters unique to bird eggs. Also, the bones found associated with the eggs seem to be avian. Palaeobiology The association of adult bones with Styloolithus eggs suggests intense parental care. The tight egg clutches show that the incubation methods differed from that of Gobipteryx. Like Troodontids, the parents of Styloolithus probably sat on top of largely buried eggs. It is unknown whether S. sabathi was incubated by the father or the mother of the eggs.

The planted clique problem is the algorithmic problem of distinguishing random graphs from graphs that have a planted clique. This is a variation of the clique problem; it may be solved in quasi-polynomial time but is conjectured not to be solvable in polynomial time for intermediate values of the clique size. The conjecture that no polynomial time solution exists is called the planted clique conjecture; it has been used as a computational hardness assumption. Definition A clique in a graph is a subset of vertices, all of which are adjacent to each other. A planted clique is a clique created from another graph by adding edges between all pairs of a selected subset of vertices. The planted clique problem can be formalized as a decision problem over a random distribution on graphs, parameterized by two numbers, (the number of vertices), and (the size of the clique). These parameters may be used to generate a graph, by the following random process:. #Create an Erdős–Rényi random graph on vertices by choosing independently for each pair of vertices whether to include an edge connecting that pair, with probability 1/2 for each pair. #Decide whether or not to add a clique to the graph, with probability 1/2; if not, return the graph formed in step 1\\\\. #Choose randomly a subset of of the vertices and add an edge (if one is not already present) between each pair of the selected vertices. The problem is then to determine algorithmically whether one of the graphs resulting from this process contains a clique of at least vertices. With high probability, the size of the largest clique in an -vertex random graph is close to . And when is larger than the square root of , the vertices of a planted clique can be recognized as having unusually large degrees, making a planted clique easy to find. Therefore, the most interesting range of values for the parameter is between these two values, :2\\\\log_2 n \\\\ll k \\\\ll \\\\sqrt n. Algorithms=Large cliques For sufficiently large values of the parameter , the planted clique problem can be solved (with high probability) in polynomial time. observes that, when k=\\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt{n\\\\log n}) then almost surely all vertices of the planted clique have higher degree than all vertices outside the clique, making the clique very easy to find. He describes a modification to the random process for generating planted clique instances, that makes the vertex degrees more uniform even for large values of , but shows that despite this modification the planted clique may still be found quickly.. prove for k>10\\\\sqrt n a planted clique can be found with high probability by the following method: #Compute the eigenvector of the adjacency matrix corresponding to its second highest eigenvalue. #Select the vertices whose coordinates in this eigenvector have the largest absolute values. #Return the set of vertices that are adjacent to at least 3/4 of the selected vertices. They show how to modify this technique so that it continues to work whenever is at least proportional to some multiple of the square root of the number of vertices. Large planted cliques can also be found using semidefinite programming.. A combinatorial technique based on randomly sampling vertices can achieve the same bound on and runs in linear time.. Quasipolynomial time It is also possible to solve the planted clique problem, regardless of the choice of , in quasi- polynomial time.. Because the largest clique in a random graph typically has size near ,. a planted clique of size (if it exists) can be found with high probability by the following method: #Loop through all sets of \\\\min(k,3\\\\log_2 n) vertices. #For each choice of , test whether is a clique. If it is, and S = k, return . Otherwise, find the set of vertices that are adjacent to all vertices in . If T\\\\ge k, return . The running time of this algorithm is quasipolynomial, because there are quasipolynomially many choices of to loop over. This method is guaranteed to try a set that is a subset of the planted clique; with high probability, the set will consist only of other members of the planted clique. As a hardness assumption The planted clique conjecture is the conjecture that there is no polynomial time algorithm that takes as input graphs produced by the planted clique process and distinguishes the ones with planted cliques from the ones that don't have planted cliques with probability significantly better than random chance.. used the assumption that finding planted cliques is hard as a computational hardness assumption to prove that, if so, it is also hard to approximate the best Nash equilibrium in a two-player game. The planted clique conjecture has also been used as a hardness assumption to show the difficulty of property testing -independence of random distributions,. finding clusters in social networks,. and machine learning..

Leighton held faculty positions at Cornell University and the University of North Carolina and she was the founding president of the Society for Medical Anthropology. She and her husband, Alexander Leighton, wrote The Navajo Door, which has been described as the first written work in applied medical anthropology.  Early life and education  Born Dorothea Cross in Lunenburg, Massachusetts, on September 2, 1908, she attended Bryn Mawr College, where she studied chemistry and biology. She graduated in 1930, and went to work at the Johns Hopkins Hospital as a technician. After two years, she matriculated at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and graduated with her MD in 1936. She married a classmate, Alexander Leighton, in 1937 (she did not receive an appointment at Johns Hopkins; he did) and had two children, then divorced in 1965.  Career and research  After earning a medical degree, Leighton studied anthropology at Creighton University. She was a resident physician in psychiatry at a clinic in Baltimore. In 1940, Leighton did fieldwork with Navajo people in Arizona and New Mexico, affiliated with the University of Chicago. She and her husband also did fieldwork in Alaska; both studies were part of an effort to incorporate anthropological methods into psychiatric interviews. In 1942, Leighton published a book that compared the Navajo philosophy of health with that of whites. She then served as a physician with the Indian Personality Research Project from 1942–1945. During this time, she worked with Clyde Kluckhohn and John Adair. Her 1944 book The Navajo Door, with Alexander Leighton, is considered \\"the earliest example of applied medical anthropology\\". She was a professor of child development and family relations at Cornell University from 1949 to 1952. While at Cornell, she studied psychiatry in a rural context, via fieldwork in Stirling County, Nova Scotia. Around 1960, she traveled to Nigeria to do similar fieldwork with Yoruba people, and also did similar studies in Sweden. Leighton then became a professor of public health and anthropology at the University of North Carolina, a position she held from 1965 to 1974, when she retired. She moved to Fresno, California, and continued to be somewhat involved in academia. In 1977, she was a lecturer at the University of California, San Francisco, and from 1981 to 1982 she was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, her last academic position before her death on August 15, 1989.

The film features unscripted vignettes of Oliver Masucci as Hitler interacting with ordinary Germans while in character, interspersed with scripted storyline sequences. It was listed as one of eight films that could be the German submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards, but it was not selected. Plot The film begins in Berlin, 2014. Adolf Hitler wakes up in the park where his former wartime bunker once stood. As he wanders, disoriented, through the city, he interprets modern situations and things from a wartime perspective. Everyone he meets assumes he is an actor impersonating Hitler. Attempting to ask directions to the Reich Chancellery, Hitler is told by a mime to find his own spot and pepper-sprayed by a terrified young mother. Arriving at a newspaper kiosk and reading that it is 2014, he becomes dizzy and faints. Meanwhile, moviemaker Fabian Sawatzki is fired from the television station MyTV and despondently watches the documentary he had been filming in the park where Hitler awoke. Seeing Hitler in the background, Sawatzki begins searching for him in hopes of getting his job back. Waking at the kiosk, Hitler begins to read about modern Germany. Through the newspapers he discovers a completely different nation from the one he left and not one agreeable to him. Lamenting that Poland still exists on formerly German soil, Hitler says the whole war was a waste. He decides that destiny has resurrected him for a reason and vows to continue his work. After finding the kiosk, Sawatzki proposes to travel across Germany with Hitler and film him for YouTube. Hitler agrees, and the two leave together. Travelling from the North Sea Coast to Bavaria, Sawatzki films Hitler interacting with ordinary Germans and promising to solve their problems with immigrants and guest-workers. When a Bavarian tells Hitler that he will never follow him, Hitler demands his name and address, saying that it's for \\"the first wave of arrests\\". The Bavarian responds that he isn't worried. Sawatzki's idea for an animal-centred film clip ends when Hitler shoots a dog with a concealed FN Model 1910 pistol. Sawatzki is outraged, but Hitler calls him a weakling and vows to make a man out of him. While their videos gain over a million hits, Sawatzki and Hitler return to Berlin. Sawatzki introduces both Hitler and his program idea to the MyTV station chiefs. The new MyTV chairman, Katja Bellini, decides to use Hitler in one of MyTV's comedies. Before the show, Hitler learns about the Internet and uses the Web to prepare his return to politics. On air, Hitler presents his old plans for an ethnically homogeneous fascist state, and unintentionally becomes a big comedy hit. As his success in comedy increases, Christoph Sensenbrink, one of MyTV's executives, discovers the unedited footage of Hitler shooting the dog. Sensenbrink broadcasts the footage, ruining the burgeoning careers of Hitler, Sawatzki, and Bellini, and resulting in his own promotion to station chief. With the help of Bellini and Sawatzki, Hitler publishes an autobiographical book about his new life in the 21st century, Er Ist Wieder Da (\\"Look Who's Back\\"), and it becomes a bestseller. Soon after, Sawatzki turns the book into a film. Without Hitler, MyTV's ratings and ad revenue drop precipitously and Sensenbrink, after a fit of rage (parodying Hitler's breakdown scene in the German drama film Downfall), decides he must rehire Hitler. Hitler plays himself in the movie. After a night of filming, he is beaten by two Neo-Nazis who believe him to be a fraudulent impersonator mocking their beliefs. Hitler is hospitalized, but the news of his beating generates sympathy and he returns to high standing with the German people. While Hitler is recuperating, Sawatzki reviews his old footage and discovers a ball of energy (based on The Terminator) in the background before Hitler first appeared. Returning to the site, he finds burnt leaves. With horror, he realizes that the Hitler he encountered was the real person all along. He rushes to the hospital to confront Hitler, but finds only Katja, who says Hitler is at the movie studio. Katja doesn't understand Sawatzki when he says Hitler is real and he trashes the hospital room before running for the exit pursued by two hospital orderlies. Sawatzki arrives at the movie studio, where he forces Hitler to the roof at gunpoint with his own pistol. Calmly, Hitler replies that he was elected by the German people, and if he is a monster, then so is everyone who voted for him. Enraged, Sawatzki shoots Hitler in the face and watches him fall off the roof to his apparent death. Suddenly Hitler reappears behind Sawatzki, claiming he cannot be killed, as he is a part of every German. This entire scene is revealed to be a part of the film, and Sawatzki is a body double wearing a silicone mask. The real Sawatzki has been committed to a mental hospital following his previous outburst that Hitler still lives. Once the work for his film finishes, Hitler senses that he is on the path to a political comeback. He is more popular than ever, and nationalist Germans give him hope that Germany may be ready for his return to power. With Hitler and Bellini riding in the back seat of an open Mercedes-Benz W31 convertible, and among images of actual nationalist demonstrations, the film ends with Hitler's voice-over: \\"I can work with this\\".

Invasive species in Mexico are a major cause of biodiversity loss, altering ecosystems, affecting native species, damaging environmental services and public health, and causing economic losses. An invasive species is one native to a particular area that has been introduced into a new habitat, adapting and altering to suit its new conditions. Due to its geography, a convergence of Nearctic and Neotropical regions, Mexico is a megadiverse country, with a high number of species. This has favored the existence of a considerable number of habitats with diversely distant species which inhabit various aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Economic, social and cultural exchange between Mexico and other countries has facilitated the entry of exotic and invasive species. Invasive fauna In Mexico the effects of invasive species has been documented since the arrival of the Europeans. Colonization brought about the systematic introduction of animals for economic purposes, but also the occasional arrival of unwanted visitors that became pests (Challenger, 1998). On account of these problematic intruders, many ecosystems were being impoverished and many species driven to extinction. There are three divisions: *Exotic species (introduced or non-native): a species established outside its natural area in differing timescales and potential spread, outside the area it occupied naturally, or that could not continue without human intervention (CBD, 2009 area; IUCN, 2000;) *Invasive exotic species: a non-native species or population outside its natural range, which is able to survive, reproduce and become established in natural habitats and ecosystems and threaten native biodiversity, economy and public health (DOF, 2010) *Invasive species: an exotic species is established in natural or semi-natural habitats or ecosystems, an agent of change that threatens native biodiversity (CBD, 2009) Not all exotic species become invasive immediately, and potential effects of a non-native species are unpredictable (DET). The problems related to invasive exotic species are complex and vast, the biggest obstacle being that it is a little-known and underestimated topic. On Mexican islands Island biodiversity is vulnerable to introduced species, because in these environments there is a high proportion of endemic species that lack defense mechanisms against exotic species with which they did not co-evolve. In particular, for island birds the risk of extinction is forty times higher than for continental species. It is the leading cause of biodiversity loss in that region. 62% of mammals, 88% of birds, 54% of amphibians, 86% of reptiles and 68% of mollusks that have been reported extinct are island species. On Mexican islands 12% of endemic birds and 20% of endemic mammals have become extinct because of introduced species. Over the last decade forty populations of introduced mammals have been eradicated on 28 islands, a step toward the conservation of over a hundred endemic species and subspecies that inhabit the islands. One exemplary result is the Gulf Islands of California, where the initiative of some individuals and civil society organizations is supported by an inter-institutional collaboration and international cooperation. Guadalupe Island Guadalupe Island is a volcano with a height of 5800 m. Its surface area is approximately 250 km². It is a center of endemism with 34 species of plants, including two classes (Redman and Moran, 1997); eight land birds; one sea bird; eleven land snails;Pilsbry, H. A. (1927). Expedition to Guadalupe Island, Mexico, in 1922: Land and Freshwater Mollusks. and at least 18 species of insects (Gonzales, 1981). The island is an important breeding site for marine mammals such as the Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus townsendi), elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), and numerous species of birds, including the Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis). In the nineteenth century, goats were introduced, reducing tree coverage of pine, cypress, juniper and oak palm to only 6% of their original coverage. Feral cats caused the extinction of six bird species, and threaten the permanence of large populations of native birds. Eradication of goats started in 2003, concluding successfully in 2006. Confirmatory monitoring took place from 2007-2009. Following the eradication, for the first time in over 150 years germination and survival of tree species was recorded, more than 130,000 in 2009, as well as observation of six native species believed extinct or extirpated from the island. The project for environmental restoration of Guadalupe Island, coupled with advances in other islands, has national and global significance, placing Mexico as an international leader in the conservation of ecosystems. Feral cats as an invasive species Cats are associated with humans as a communal species, and impact an area of 5 km around each center of human population. Their presence is particularly important in oceanic islands (CONABIO, 2008), where they are the predator with the greatest impact on seabird populations. Some examples of species that have been reduced almost to extinction are the Mexican shearwater (Puffinus opisthomelas), Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), and Xantus's murrelet (Synthliboramphus hypoleucus). Extinct species include the Guadalupe storm petrel (Oceanodroma macrodactyla), the Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni) and an endemic sparrow of Todos Santos Island (Aimophila ruficeps sanctorum). Cats are a risk factor for the populations of many endemic rodents, like the Chaetodipus anthonyi and Peromyscus interparietalis mice, as well as the Neotoma bryanti rat, and the extinction of the Neotoma anthonyi and Neotoma martinensis endemic rats. It is possible that Peromyscus guardia has become extinct due to the introduction of cats in Ángel de la Guarda Island (, CONABIO 2008). The feral cat has also reduced the rabbit population (Sylvilagus bachmani cerrosensis) on Cedros Island. Cats are one of the most important risk factors for waterfowl populations of Ángel de la Guarda Island, San Marcos, Carmen, Santa Catalina and Cerralvo (Velarde and Anderson, 1994). Cats also carry and transmit numerous diseases and parasites, some of which can be transmitted to humans (CONABIO, 2008). Introduction of non-native bees The introduction of pollinating bumblebees (Bombus) significantly affected native pollinators and both native and introduced plants. The introduced bees are highly pollinating, are abundant in invaded areas, and in some cases, dominate the communities in which they live. In general, they acquire resources more efficiently than native species, despite using the same flowers; they are mutually exclusive both spatially and temporally, suggesting potential competition with native species. Colonies of B. impatiens, originally from the northeast United States, have been imported to Mexico. B. terrestris, a species native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia was introduced in other areas as a pollinator of commercial crops. Introduction of geckos The common house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus) (Dumeril & Bibron 1836) synonymous with H. nigriventris, also known as house gecko or bridled house gecko, is native to the islands of the Pacific Ocean. It is currently found throughout the tropics of the Old World and is distributed discontinuously in Central America. Its introduction was probably accidental and repeated, as a stowaway on commercial cargo ships coming from the Pacific Islands. This gecko could potentially have a negative effect on local populations of other gecko species, either because their nocturnal eating habits may be similar, or because adult geckos can prey on juveniles of other lizards and even their own kind. Under specific conditions, they may be vectors of disease or parasites to the native fauna.Alvares et al. (2008). Animales exóticos en México: una amenaza para la biodiversidad. Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad, 12, 41, 277- 280 Revisado en: http://www2.inecc.gob.mx/publicaciones/download/590.pdf Invasive amphibia The American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is native to Canada and the eastern United States, and was introduced in the early 1900s to Colorado and California. The first records of the species in Mexico date from 1853. It is a very aggressive species and an unspecialized predator, which has a negative impact on the populations of virtually any animal it can capture or ingest. Its introduction has caused the extinction of native amphibians. One can anticipate a negative effect on native vertebrate and invertebrate populations, aquatic and terrestrial, in any location. This problem has been known for thirty years. The species is considered among the 100 most important invasive exotic species at a global level. The main concern is due to the potential it has to compete with and prey on other species. Invasive reptiles Japanese and red-eared turtles (Trachemys scripta) are native to the country and sold in many pet stores, in most cases released when the owners see the size at which they reach adulthood. The turtle is considered one of the 100 most dangerous invasive species by the Specialist Group on Invasive Species of the IUCN for its omnivorous diet and being inclined to compete with other species of turtles for basking places, besides being an important vector of potentially harmful pathogens for humans and other species (Bringsoe, 2006). Trade of this species should be regulated more effectively to urge the public not to release their pets in nature when they no longer want to be responsible for them. Invasive species in urban environments Several invasive bird species are found in urban areas. The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) was originally distributed in the Middle East to the Mediterranean region, and was introduced in 1850 in North America. It competes for food and nesting sites with other species. The rock dove (Columba livia) is native to Europe and has been introduced worldwide. It causes damage to buildings and transmits diseases to other species. Similarly, the monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) is native to Argentina and Uruguay and is a recognized pest of crops. It is easily adapted to urban environments so it has high demand as a pet in Mexico. People unaware of the potential damage liberate and help feed them, as well as pigeons and house sparrows. Invasive terrestrial plants Invasive plants are fast-growing pioneer species that take advantage of disturbed areas to colonize bare soil. Once established, they inhibit seed germination or development of native species, and can dominate the vegetation, preventing the disturbed ecosystem from restoring itself. In Mexico there are various efforts to identify and monitor invasive plants. CONABIO (2015) listed 145 species and established a monitoring network. It also created a hierarchy of species' invasiveness according to their ability to spread, their establishment, and their impact on biodiversity (UNIBIO, s.a.). Subsequent date produced by the network UNIBIO (s.a.) listed 226 invasive species across Mexico, of which 2% have a degree of \\"extreme invasiveness\\", 46% \\"high invasiveness\\", and 15% \\"moderate invasiveness\\". Combining these three categories, there are a total of 184 species identified as invasive plants. Invasive species with an extreme degree of invasiveness identified by the Network are: #Eucalyptus globulus #Ricinus communis #Pennisetum clandestinum #Eragrostis lehmanniana #Cenchrus ciliaris #Rhynchelytrum repens #Tamarix ramosissima Of these 7 species, 4 belong to the grass family (Poaceae). This group contains the largest number of invasive plants in Mexico, with 82 species of 226 total registered so far. The family with the second highest number of invasive species is the Asteraceae with 14 species, and joint third and fourth are the Fabaceae and Brassicaceae, containing 12 species each (UNIBIO, s.a.). Distribution According to monitoring conducted by the UNIBIO (s.a.), there are invasive species in all states of the Republic. Significantly, all of them except Guerrero, Tabasco and Baja California Sur have at least one species classified as extremely invasive, and all of them have highly invasive species. Related to that geographic distribution, ecosystems have also been identified that have a higher number of invasive plant species. The most affected ecosystem is the Tropical Deciduous Forest, followed by Ripario and the Aquatic. Less affected ecosystems are Sarco Scrub, Misty, and Savannah, followed by Low Evergreen Forest (UNIBIO, s.a.). Causes of increased invasive species Today the threat has increased and incidences of invasive plants in Mexico is caused by two factors. Firstly, the increase of invasive plants is attributed to a parallel increase in disturbed areas in the country, caused by logging and a growing number of abandoned pastures. The second is the introduction of exotic species to the territory by human activity, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Of the exotic species in Mexico, only a small percentage becomes invasive, which occurs when the plant is a \\"free niche\\", or \\"a type of habitat that was not used by a native plant\\". Introduction of Eucalyptus globulus Eucalyptus globulus Eucalyptus globulus was introduced to Mexico for various reasons, one of which was as a strategy of \\"cleaning up\\" the valley of Mexico and reducing cases of Malaria. Eucalyptus globulus was brought to Mexico since it had a history of being successfully employed for this kind of sanitation in Spain and Italy in the last third of the past century, as well as for its possible medical uses. The high distribution of Eucalyptus in Mexico dates from the 1990s, when the government of Mexico, along with large companies, promoted large-scale tree plantations in order to promote a domestic paper industry. For these purposes, and because of its rapid growth, high adaptability, and quality of cellulose fibers, plantations of several species of eucalyptus have been encouraged, including Eucalyptus globulus in Mexican territory. The case of Eucalyptus globulus is a clear example of how human action contributed to the presence of invasive species in Mexico. According to data produced by the UNIBIO Monitoring Network (s.a.), it is one of the 7 extremely invasive species in Mexico. Invasive aquatic species The ecosystems most affected by the presence of invasive marine species are islands and inland waters. Freshwater ecosystems are very rich in plants and animals relative to the extent of the habitat. They can be considered the most threatened ecosystems in the world due to the much faster rate at which biodiversity is lost. By the end of the 19th century, 123 species had been declared extinct in North America. In reality many species of fish, mollusks, crustaceans and amphibians are considered threatened at some level, and it is calculated that half of freshwater mussels, a third of prawns, a fourth of amphibians and a fifth of fish will have disappeared by the year 2100. Today approximately 39% of freshwater fish in the American continent are threatened to some degree, including 230 vulnerable species, 190 threatened, 280 in danger, and 61 extinct or removed from their natural habitat. ¨Biological invasions are so extensive in the marine environment that only 16% of the marine eco-regions of the world have no report of invasive species¨ (Molnar et al., 2008). The ecological impacts depend on the type of species, the magnitude of the invasion, and the vulnerability of the invaded ecosystem.Ciruna, K., L. Meyerson y A. Gutiérrez. 2004. The ecological and socio-economic impacts of invasive alien species in inland water ecosystems. Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity on behalf of the Global Invasive Species Programme, Washington. Loss and degradation of biodiversity can occur from a genetic level to a systemic one, causing alterations to habitats, fundamental ecological properties of the ecosystem, chemical characteristics of the water, biogeochemical processes, and trophic nets. These impacts vary in the time lapse between the initial introduction and the subsequent dispersion of the invasive species, the severity of the impact, feasibility of synergistic interactions with other threatening processes and the potential for starting a cascade of ramifications in the whole ecosystem. Oftentimes invasive species increase rapidly because of the absence of natural predators, which leads to a loss of native species. They have caused the extinction of 48-62% of the species of fish in the world (Pimentel et al., 2000). In Mexico, of 506 species of freshwater fish, 169 are at risk and 25 are extinct. The states most affected are Nuevo León and Coahuila, and the principal causes are the reduction or alteration of habitat, loss of water, and introduction of foreign species. On occasion, foreign species are introduced by the government. In Mexico, carp and tilapia were introduced by the Secretary of Fishing (; Contreras Balderas, 1999). In addition to the danger they pose to native fauna, these species bring impacts on the structure and function of the ecosystem. The registry of coypu (Myocastor coypus) in the Bravo River, the same species that has caused damage to the agriculture and riverbeds of the rivers in Italy, reaches 2.8 million dollars each year. Some invasive species can distinctly affect fisheries, as with lampreys, the control of which caused losses of more than 500 million dollars per year. The Salvinia molesta and the water lily (Eichhornia crassipes) can impede navigation. Some invasive species bring sanitary problems to human health. Species that are pathogens or parasites that cause direct harm, or that act as carriers for such species, can have serious consequences. Pathogen carriers are species like the snail Melanoides tuberculata, which has displaced native species in Nuevo León (Contreras-Arquieta y Contreras-Balderas, 1999). Due to its high reproductive potential (as a parthenogenic species), it modifies the conditions of the habitat, and it carries trematoda such as Clonorchis sinensis, a parasite that can damage the human liver. Pathogens that cause direct harm include the harmful algal bloom (HAB) and the red tides that have intensified in frequency and duration in aquatic environments across the world. The proliferation of HABs creates dead zones that use up all available oxygen. Certain species even produce toxins that damage the digestive and nervous systems of humans and many animals. For example, lionfish (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles) are predators that affect species of fish and invertebrates in reefs and mangrove swamps of the Gulf of Mexico, such as the grouper and the northern red snapper that are of great economic importance. These species of lionfish are also venomous, making them dangerous to many species including humans. The displacement of native charal (genus chirostoma) by two species of centralized foreign invaders, the black bass (Micropterus salmoides) and the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), is the subject of a case study on prey in the Bravo Valley, State of Mexico. Fish of the family Atherinopsidae and genus chirostoma are known as charal and silversides. Charal are a small fish while silversides are much larger (up to 20 cm). All chirostoma are endemic to the Mexican plateaus and are freshwater species. It is estimated that 18 to 20 species and various subspecies exist in the central mesa of Mexico. Charal have economic, cultural and environmental importance for Mexicans. They have been consumed in this area since pre-Spanish times, but are noticeably shrinking in the last decades, as overexploitation of bodies of water, overfishing, and the introduction of foreign species such as the black bass and bluegill are permitted in their habitats. In reality charal are in danger of extinction from a conjunction of factors. Since 1900 the extent of lakes in central Mexico has notably decreased, degrading habitats (Alcocer y Escobar 1996). High demand has caused overfishing, excessive exploitation has focused on all classes and sizes. Species introduced in freshwater systems exert pressure on other species.Contreras Balderas, S., R. Mendoza Alfaro y C. Ramírez Martínez (2008). Distribución espacial de las especies de peces. En: J. Soberón, G. Halffter y J. Llorente-Bousquets (comps.). Capital natural de México Vol. I Conocimiento actual de la biodiversidad. J. Sarukhán (coord. gral.). Conabio, México, pp. 323–364 Native species are displaced by direct competition, predators, transmission of illnesses, modification of the habitat and trophic alterations to the community. The black bass is considered one of the top 100 most damaging invasive species, targeting native species of small fish as prey and resulting in the decline of populations or even their extinction. The black bass and the bluegill coexist in their natural distribution as predator and prey in Mexico and both have been introduced in bodies of water inhabited by charal (Lacepède, 1802 y Lepomis machrochirus, Rafinesque, 1819). When the black bass reaches 120 mm it preys upon the charal. In the reservoir of Bravo Valley, smaller bass and bluegills eat the same food as the charal, and with the rate at which the bass grows, the charal becomes their main diet. Although the bass and bluegill play a predator-prey role elsewhere, the black bass prefers other species that are not prepared to face it, as is the case with the charal (Gallardo-Torres. et al., s/a). Therefore, charal have been hunted intensely by the black bass while having to face the competition of the bluegill to obtain food, which has led to a noticeable dwindling of their population. One of the principal forms in which invasive aquatic species are introduced is the ballast water of boats. The ballast water is contained in tanks within boats with the purpose of stabilizing the ship during a voyage. This water is later unloaded by the boat before arriving at its destination. Experts agree that 10 to 14 billion tons of ballast water are transferred from one place to another and around 7,000 species are transported every day. Numerous experts believe that the ballast water used in voyages is key to the introduction of these species globally.Bergmans, W. y E. Blom. (2001). Invasive plants and animals: is there a way out? Proceedings of a Conference on Alien Invasive Species on the 26th of September, 2000 in the National Museum of Natural History Naturalis in Leiden, Holanda, 80 pp. Public policies for control and management The States utilize diverse mediums toward the creation of specialized legislation, environmental institutions, and global strategies, toward the celebration of an accordance or national conventions. Legislation and international standards Within the international context there has been a series of accords signed that bring to light the prospects of invasive species. On one side is the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, 1993), and its derivative the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (2003), which were not signed by the United States. On the other side, within the background of the CBD, is the International Plant Protection Convention, administered by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, 1983). The Convention on Wetlands signed in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES, 1992). The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures from the World Trade Organization. The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments was adopted in 2004 by the International Maritime Organization and defines in Article 1 the management of ballast water. In North America the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation is relevant, derived from the parallel environmental agreement of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is important in promoting the investigation and development of inventories of invasive species, in the generation of directives for risk analysis of aquatic invasive species, as with the analysis of paths of invasion (CCA, 2013). There exists a diversity of legal instruments for health, natural resources, or environments, of organic and fiscal character, from which some can contribute to resolving the problem of invasive species in the legal field with the essential participation of non-governmental participants. Nevertheless, there also exist two great legislations that construct the international status quo: *The European Union (commission of European communities, 2008) has a number of directives such as the Directive of Plant Health (2000/29/CE) charged with the prevention of the introduction of invasive species; directives about protection of nature (79/409/CEE and 92/43/CEE) that prohibit the introduction of species that could constitute a threat to indigenous species; the directive setting the framework for water (2000/60/CE) that calls for the member states to maintain a good ecological state in the waters to which it applies; and the directive setting the framework for marine strategy (2008/56/CE). It has a veterinary legislation that can apply to the vectors of illness in animals. There also exists a law about the commerce of wild fauna and flora (CE) advice number 338/97, the law (CE) advice number 708/2007 about the use of exotic species. In addition the LIFE Program provides help to projects for the control and eradication of invasive species. *The Convention on Biological Diversity has established priorities and directives, recompiled information, and helped coordinate international actions related to foreign invasive species. It is governed through these guiding principles: A. General :# focus on precaution :# hierarchic focus in 3 steps :# focus on ecosystems :# responsibility of the state :# investigation and supervision :# education and public consciousness B. Prevention :# border control and quarantine measures :# information exchange :# cooperation, including the creation of capacity C. Introduction of Species :# deliberate introduction :# involuntary introduction D. Reducing Impact :# reducing impact :# eradication :# contention :# control Mexican legislation International treaties celebrated by Mexico in agreement with the Constitution are signed by the executive, approved by the Senate, and published in the Diario Oficial de la Federación (DOF), the Official Journal of the Federation, which along with the Constitution and the federal laws is the Supreme Law of the Union. They have full force and can be applied directly to the interior rights of the country (Segob 2014: art. 133 y 76 en Herrera, et al., 2014). The institutional federal view on the topic of invasive species in Mexico consists of: SAGARPA (the Secretariat of Agriculture and Fisheries) through General Coordination of Livestock, Undersecretary of Agriculture and Undersecretary of Rural Development, SINASICA, CONAPESCA (the National Aquaculture and Fishing Commission), Inapesca (a division of SAGARPA), and INIFAP, the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias (National Institution of Forest, Agriculture, and Fish Investigations). SEMARNAT (the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources) works alongside the DGVS, DGGFS and DGIRA, CONAFOR, INECC, CONANP, PROFEPA and CONABIO. Other dependencies with direct participation in the topic are the Secretary of Communication and Transportation, the Secretary of National Defense, and the Secretary of the Marine. Mexican legislation comprises a series of legal instruments related to invasive species: the Federal Law of Animal Health, the Federal Law of Plant Health, the General Law of Ecologic Equilibrium and Environmental Protection, the General Law of Wildlife, the General Law of Federal Development, the General Law of Fish and Sustainable Aquaculture, and the Law of Biosecurity of Genetically Modified Organisms. Since 2010 the Mexican government has promoted the National Strategy of Invasive Species, which provided a guide for different social actors to confront invasive species, although barely consolidating the strength to monitor the goals and achievements it raised, since within the components of the National Strategy emerging factors such as hybridization and climate change still have not been considered. Within the given strategies, CONABIO has established the Invasive Species Program, which represents a national database on the foreign species with invasive potential, as much for those that are established as those that have yet to settle and represent a risk to the country. Combating invasive aquatic species Invasive aquatic species are considered an important challenge because of their destructive capacity and negative effect on biological diversity, particularly in the marine world. International law, through international agreements and global institutional strategies, searches to lessen this problem. National, regional, and international organisms combine efforts to carry out the application of the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments adopted in 2004, that to date has been ratified by 30 countries. This represents only 35% of the global fleet. Its ratification would facilitate prevention with respect to the organisms introduced as stowaways in the body or ballast water of ships. The International Accords treat the challenge of invasive aquatic species in parts, which occasionally overlap. Even if the international strategies of the CCA, the code FAO, and the UICN represent important efforts and have the potential to direct the United States and support them, technically to identify and combat invasive aquatic species, they lack obligation. With respect to the implementation of the CBD toward invasive aquatic species, in the last report Mexico indicated that a group of intersectoral work had been formed to address the topic. In addition, it demonstrated that they were working on a program to identify the marine and coastal species. The fourth Mexican national report (CONABIO and Semarnat 2009) also informed that they had identified a total of 811 species, including vascular and terrestrial plants with invasive potential as well as aquatic and marine plants. This figure could be underestimated. With respect to the impact of regional efforts in North America in the forum of the CCA, these are not centered specifically on controlling and combating aquatic invasive species. However, it has taken directives for the evaluation of risk of foreign aquatic invasive species, with the objective to serve as support in high level decisions of each member country of the agreement, essentially focused on reverting the complication that brought invasive species into the aquatic ecosystem. Between the normative adjustments that could serve to enforce and harmonize the most relevant provisions of force to attend to the problem of invasive species in an aquatic environment is the publication of a secretarial accord with the list of foreign invasive species predicted in the General Law of Wildlife, as in the elaboration of a draft of secretarial accord for the formalization and organization of work in a technical committee, for publication in the official journal of the federation.

History Medieval Lucca, like many medieval cities in Italy abounded with private towers, built for protection, exemplified best today by the remaining towers of San Gimignano. This tower, the tallest in Lucca, was acquired by the government in the 14th century, and in 1390, it was decided to house a clock. In Lucca, the nearby Torre Guinigi with the scenographic tree- scape at the top is more visited. It is now owned by the Comune of Lucca. The present mechanism of the clock dates to the 18th-century. It is unclear what the face of the clock and the mechanism consisted in 1390. Earlier clock towers did have hour markings. In 2015, it is possible to climb to the tower and view the mechanism. There is a legend associated with a young woman who sold her soul to the devil, but was captured by the devil trying to stop the time of the clock.Comune of Lucca, entry on clock.

During his playing days, he was a midfielder, and played for clubs in Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. As a coach, he worked mainly with Atlético Mineiro, but also coached many other clubs in Brazil and the Indonesia national under-23 team. Career=Player Barbatana first played in a club in his hometown Ponte Nova as a condition to work in the city's sugar refinery. The team was called Sport Club Ana Florentina, but soon he was seen by and went to play for Metalusina, a club from Barão de Cocais. After a friendly between Metalusina and Atlético Mineiro played in the city, Barbatana moved to the latter in 1950, taking part in that year's Campeonato Mineiro and the 1950 Atlético Mineiro European tour. He was not under contract, and was sent back to Metalusina with the promise of being signed. However, Bangu also noticed Barbatana and signed him. He spent two seasons with Bangu, before returning to Minas Gerais to play for Villa Nova in 1953, where he was coached by Yustrich. The manager moved to Porto in 1955 and wanted to take the player with him, but Barbatana chose to sign with América Mineiro. He spent two seasons at América, before returning to rivals Atlético Mineiro, where he ended his career. Manager After retiring from playing, Barbatana spent nine years away from football, until he was called up by an Atlético Mineiro director, who invited him to coach the club's youth squads. Barbatana agreed, initially to a three-month experience period, but remained in the position for years, discovering players like Lola, Humberto Ramos, Marcelo Oliveira, Toninho Cerezo, Paulo Isidoro and Reinaldo, who would become an Atlético Mineiro legend. Barbatana then had stints as Atlético's caretaker manager in the 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1975, he coached Goiás and CEUB. He became manager of Atlético Mineiro's first squad in 1976, where he was reunited with former youth squads graduates Oliveira, Cerezo, Isidoro and Reinaldo, leading the team to an undefeated runner-up season in the 1977 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. He left the club in 1978, and spent a period managing Atlético's rivals Cruzeiro in 1979. Barbatana then manager Sport Recife in 1981, and returned to Atlético in 1982. He also managed the Indonesia national under-23 team, Náutico, Al-Hilal FC, Nacional (AM) and América Mineiro during his career, which ended in 1992 once again with Atlético Mineiro. He is the fourth manager with most matches for Atlético, with 227.  Death  Barbatana died on 29 June 2011, in Belo Horizonte, aged 82, victim of Alzheimer's disease.

The term implies a combination of avant-garde sensibilities with existing elements from popular music in the service of novel or idiosyncratic artistic visions. Definition \\"Avant-pop\\" has been used to label music which balances experimental or avant-garde approaches with stylistic elements from popular music, and which probes mainstream conventions of structure or form. Writer Tejumola Olaniyan describes \\"avant-pop music\\" as transgressing \\"the boundaries of established styles, the meanings those styles reference, and the social norms they support or imply.\\" Music writer Sean Albiez describes \\"avant-pop\\" as identifying idiosyncratic artists working in \\"a liminal space between contemporary classical music and the many popular music genres that developed in the second half of the twentieth century.\\" He noted avant-pop's basis in experimentalism, as well its postmodern and non-hierarchical incorporation of varied genres such as pop, electronica, rock, classical, and jazz. Paul Grimstad of The Brooklyn Rail writes that avant-pop is music that \\"re-sequences\\" the elements of song structure \\"so that (a) none of the charm of the tune is lost, but (b) this very accessibility leads one to bump into weirder elements welded into the design.\\" The Tribeca New Music Festival defines \\"avant-pop\\" as \\"music that draws its energy from both popular music and classical forms.\\" The term has elsewhere been used by literary critic Larry McCaffery to describe \\"the most radical, subversive literary talents of the postmodern new wave.\\" History In the 1960s, as popular music began to gain cultural importance and question its status as commercial entertainment, musicians began to look to the post-war avant-garde for inspiration. In 1959, music producer Joe Meek recorded I Hear a New World (1960), which Tiny Mix Tapes Jonathan Patrick calls a \\"seminal moment in both electronic music and avant-pop history [...] a collection of dreamy pop vignettes, adorned with dubby echoes and tape-warped sonic tendrils\\" which would be largely ignored at the time. Other early avant-pop productions included the Beatles's 1966 song \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", which incorporated techniques from musique concrète, avant-garde composition, Indian music, and electro-acoustic sound manipulation into a 3-minute pop format, and the Velvet Underground's integration of La Monte Young's minimalist and drone music ideas, beat poetry, and 1960s pop art. In late 1960s Germany, an experimental avant-pop scene dubbed \\"krautrock\\" saw influential artists such as Kraftwerk, Can, and Tangerine Dream draw inspiration from free jazz, German academic music, and Anglo-American pop- rock. According to The Quietus David McNamee, the 1968 album An Electric Storm, recorded by the electronic music group White Noise (featuring members from the U.K.’s BBC Radiophonic Workshop), is an \\"undisputed masterpiece of early avant-pop\\". In the 1970s, progressive rock and post-punk music would see new avant-pop fusions, including the work of Pink Floyd, Genesis, Henry Cow, This Heat, and the Pop Group. More contemporary avant-pop artists have included David Sylvian, Scott Walker, and Björk, whose vocal experimentation and innovative modes of expression have seen them move beyond norms of commercial pop music. Others who have been credited as avant-pop's pioneers include the Velvet Underground's Lou Reed, singer Kate Bush, performance artist Laurie Anderson, art pop musician Spookey Ruben, and Black Dice's Eric Copeland.Pitchfork Staff \\"Eric Copeland: avant-pop pioneer\\", Guardian Music Blog, November 18, 2008, accessed March 22, 2011.

The fountain contains statues based on Greek mythology. The surrounding area, once the location for Montgomery's bustling slave trade, has seen most of its historical buildings torn down; the fountain's statues were replaced with aluminum ones in the 1980s. Location, history The fountain was built on top of an artesian well, a watering hole already for the native Alabamians long before the coming of whites. By June 1853 the well was 475 feet deep and flowed at two gallons per minute. The location is also the place where two communities, Alabama Town and New Philadelphia, had grown together to form what would be called Montgomery. Later, the area was the central location of the Montgomery slave trade. Description The fountain was long believed to have been the work of Frederick MacMonnies; the director of the Alabama Archives and History in 1935 asked him if it was his design, and he denied. On top of the fountain is a statue of Hebe, the Greek goddess of eternal youth. The fountain itself is made of cast iron. The statues came from a catalog of zinc iron statues: on top, a \\"Canova's Hebe\\", one layer down four \\"Seated Boys\\" holding towels, one layer down four \\"Narcissus\\" figures, and at the bottom a \\"Stem Bitterns\\", \\"a group of three free-standing birds around the base stem of a cast-iron fountain\\". All these statues were replaced in 1984 by aluminum versions; those, however, were corroded by chlorine in the water only twenty years later. The historical buildings around the fountain, which was known as the \\"romantic center\\" of the city, have mostly been demolished, one entire block of them in the 1960s to make way for a Pizitz department store, which opened in 1972. Across from the fountain on Court Square is the Winter Building, whence the telegram giving the order to fire on Fort Sumter was given. Also across from the fountain, is the bus stop that Rosa Parks famously refused to give up her seat thus starting the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a crucial part in the early Civil Right Movement. Rosa Parks refused her seat not at Court Sq. but further up the street where the Empire Theater was. Section 486 of the Montgomery City Ordinance (1888 version) forbids the interfering with fish and fowl in the basin of the statue, or the disposing of liquids or solids in it; violators could be fined $100. The sculpture of Hebe at the top of the fountain was likely modeled on a sculpture by Antonio Canova. Nearly identical fountains can be found at Fountain Square in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and Court Square in Memphis, Tennessee, all cast by J.L. Mott Ironworks of New York. In art Montgomery-born painter Anne Goldthwaite depicted the fountain with a cotton wagon running along in front of it in her painting Bringing Cotton Bails to Market. Zelda Fitzgerald played here as a child, and poet Andrew Hudgins located one of the poems in A Clown at Midnight (2013) at the fountain.

The script was written by Wan Fang. At the time of filming, Tao Hong was a third-year student at the Central Academy of Drama, acting in her second film role. She was chosen for the lead role mainly because of her athletic background, as she had been a professional synchronised swimmer for 10 years. To prepare for the film, Tao also spent time among disabled people. Her performance in this film won her some of the highest honors in China, as well as awards in Syria and France. A number of real-life Chinese Paralympians appeared in small roles, such as Wang Juan. Plot If not for attending a school for the blind, Ding Lihua (Tao Hong) is just like any other young, silly girl. The chirping of canary or the touch of snow will bring out a big smile from her. She hates it, however, when people mention her disability especially out of sympathy, and when her brother (Zhang Wankun) and sister-in-law (Ding Jiali) try to matchmake her with an older blind musician, she takes offense. One day, running after her brother's bicycle on the rural road, Ding is spotted by Li Mingsheng (Jiang Kai), a dedicated Paralympic coach who trains a group of disabled track athletes. Ding joins his team, though she quits not long after due to a disagreement with his harsh training method. Realizing that running under Li is her best bet to become something, she returns to the team, and Li quickly sees the potential and the competitive spirit in her. They train hard and Ding wins the 100-metre dash in her first official competition. Ding develops feelings for Li, even though she is also aware that he is fully healthy with a beautiful girlfriend Yu Su (Cui Qianmei). Around this time, Liu Yi (He Bing), a rich ex-classmate, visits her frequently with the intention of dating her. Though not interested in him, Ding borrows money from Liu to try to help Li mend his failing relationship with Yu, but Li and Yu still break up for good. Li thanks Ding, but rejects her love. Ding becomes sullen, and leaves the team again after an argument with Li. Li gains more understanding of blind people that they wish to be treated normally more than they need sympathy, while Ding also realizes that she needs to accept the reality that she is blind and different from others. After winning a gold medal at a Paralympic Games for China, Ding returns home and becomes a masseuse. It is through sports that she becomes a confident human being, and she begins to see colors in her dreams.

Along with Gilbert Seldes, Mitchell’s editorship of The Dial magazine signaled a pivotal shift in content from political articles to aesthetics in art and literature.  Early life  Mitchell was born November 25, 1892, in Cincinnati, Ohio. After graduating from Harvard University in 1916 he taught English literature at the University of Wisconsin. He resigned his position for political reasons, frustrated that he was forced to give a “politician’s son who should have been flunked” passing grades.C. K. S. “Stewart Mitchell.” Obituaries: American Antiquarian Society (1958): 13-14. Print. Mitchell enlisted in the army, serving in France until he was discharged as a private two years later.  Involvement with The Dial  Mitchell returned to the United States and was hired by Scofield Thayer and James Sibley Watson as managing editor of their joint project, The Dial. Mitchell, in association with Gilbert Seldes, was managing editor from 1919-1920. His appointment as editor marked a shift in the influential, modernist little magazine’s focus on politics to an artistic, literary theme. Mitchell’s work for The Dial involved not only editing but, as was common with the majority of The Dial’s editors, active involvement with and submissions to the creative or literary content.  Literary works  Mitchell’s associating with The Dial proved advantageous and profitable to his own literary career. He completed and sold a volume of poetryMitchell, Stewart. Poems. New York: Dufield & Co., 1921. Print. that was published in 1921. Several of the poems in his collection were first printed in The Dial. These were reprinted with permission from Scofield Thayer. Following Mitchell’s resignation as editor Mitchell continued to submit book reviews as well as poetry.  Further education, The New England Quarterly, and the Massachusetts Historical Society  His desire to travel led Mitchell to give up editorship of The Dial and pursue further education abroad. In 1922, following two years’ study at the University of Montpellier and Jesus College, Cambridge, he returned to the States and lived with his elderly aunt in New York. Mitchell privately studied foreign language and literature, focusing on French and Greek, before returning to Harvard and graduating with a Ph.D. in Literature in 1933. While completing his degree he also worked as editor for the New England Quarterly in 1928. The following year he gave up his position to become editor for the Massachusetts Historical Society. It was as a historical editor that Mitchell, according to his associates, truly excelled. His \\"naturally keen memory and sharp eye, coupled with a sure ear for words and an occasionally brilliant wit, permitted him to excel.\\" After eleven years' service he resigned but was recalled in 1947 as Director and editor. Personal life and death Mitchell's long-time partner was Richard David Cowan (1909-1939), a student of Cornell University in the 1920s who met Mitchell in the 1930s and they lived together since then. Mitchell died in Brookline, Massachusetts on November 3, 1957 and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts, alongside Richard Cowan, who preceded him in death.Freiberg, Malcolm. “Stewart Mitchell.” Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society 72 (1960): 361-363\\\\.

Several apartment complexes and houses were wiped out, and at least 156 people lost their lives. The landslides had been caused by waterlogged soils in the area, a result of Typhoon Rose bringing unusually heavy rainfall in August 1971 as well as heavy rainstorms hitting Hong Kong on the days preceding the landslides.  Background  Po Shan Road in the Mid-Levels was the site of the largest major landslide to occur in June 1972. The area in general had long been susceptible to landslips and rockfall since it was developed; several other major landslides had occurred at or near Po Shan Road before 1972. These included a large landslip in 1925, which caused many deaths, as well as large but relatively undamaging landslides in 1941, 1950 and 1966. Most of these had been caused by heavy rainstorms, in a similar manner to the 1972 landslides. Shiu Fai Terrace, another site of landslips, had been leased in 1920 and the number and height of buildings that could be built on it had been restricted, probably decreasing the death toll of the 1972 disasters. On 18 June, to cope with the disasters, all British Forces in the colony were mobilised, all police and fire services leave was cancelled, and the Civil Aid Service and Auxiliary Medical Services were called to assist in rescue operations.  Shiu Fai Terrace  Multiple landslides also occurred at Shiu Fai Terrace in Wan Chai. In total, three large landslips occurred over a continuous area on June 16. They were not as large as the Po Shan Road disaster but altogether affected a greater area. Several were killed by the landslips. Throughout June 1972, multiple incidents of landslides occurred throughout Hong Kong, especially in Wan Chai. In total, combined with the Po Shan and Shiu Fai landslides, the landslips killed around 148 people. While they severely crippled infrastructure and emergency services through Hong Kong, the landslides of 1972 have led to improved guidelines for hillside excavation and safety and rescue procedures, and no such disaster has caused such a large loss of life in Hong Kong since. Sau Mau Ping landslide At midday on 18 June, a landslide buried a squatter village at the Sau Mau Ping licensed area, killing 71. The mud spilled over Tsui Ping Road into the Kwun Tong Resettlement Estate. Resettlement Department staff and fathers of the adjacent Kwun Tong Maryknoll College launched the rescue operation. They were joined by 600 personnel from the army, police, fire services, Civil Aid Service, and Auxiliary Medical Service. Many of those killed were children. Survivors were billeted at the Kun Tong Police Station and the Sau Mau Ping Resettlement Estate. The collapsed hill slope was reconstructed with a gentler grade. The disaster site is now home to the Sau Mau Ping Memorial Park, opened 1976.  Po Shan Road landslide  On June 16, 1972, several minor slips of mud were noticed along Po Shan Road. The road was blocked off by falling mud at a construction site and several cracks started to appear in a retaining wall. Inspections were performed on many structures but as it was raining, ultimately no major evacuation or alert measures were undertaken. On June 17, a slip had occurred over the whole width of the cut slope at the southern face of Inland Lot 2260 on Po Shan Road, carrying away nearly all the bamboo framing and metal sheet covering. In addition, authorities noticed severe subsidence of several buildings around IL 2260. Residents were then urged to leave their houses and apartments as a precaution. On June 18, it was still raining, and the situation had gotten worse. Cracks continued to appear in retaining walls, and mud had started to fall on nearby Conduit Road. Po Shan Road was cordoned off to the public and nearby apartments were evacuated as it quickly became apparent that a large landslide would soon occur. A little after 5 p.m. that day, a huge mass of rocks, mud and vegetation suddenly broke free and slid down the side of IL 2260, breaking through a retaining wall on Kotewall Road and completely blocking Conduit Road. There were no deaths directly resulting from this slip, however. Then, some time after 8 p.m., an even larger landslip occurred starting at IL 2260 and, in less than ten seconds, cleared a path from Po Shan Road to Kotewall Road, destroying several houses and retaining walls in the process. Upon hitting Kotewall Road, the slip knocked Kotewall Court (the only well-lit building in the area at the time) completely off of its foundation and collapsed several flats at Robinson Road and Babington Path. 67 people were killed and 20 were injured in less than a minute Because of the lack of lighting and the rain, as well as the fact that much of the transportation network had been destroyed, rescue efforts were initially sporadic and hampered. Some landslips continued to occur, causing withdrawals of emergency personnel. More than an hour had passed when the first survivors were pulled from the rubble, at 9:24. Eventually, however, most known survivors had been rescued in the next several days.

She flees from her smuggler, Shing (Shum Wai), after she injures him when she was harassed by him. Meanwhile, police detective Ho Ting- pong (Chow Yun-fat) is an upright and virtuous police officer who was assigned with his partner, Long Man (David Lui), to arrest drug dealer Addict Hung (Ng Hong-sang) in a supermarket.

It consists in a quadrant based matrix which evaluate companies’ performance and is intended to do for organisational design what SWOT analysis does for strategy. The analysis is based on the assumption that companies consist of four managerial disciplines – directorship, leadership, management and assurance – in competitive tensions between each other. The tool provides a solid framework to analyse the effects of such strain on business performances.  Contents  The acronym “DLMA” origins from the four systems of thought and action that create a company: directorship, leadership, management, and assurance (also known as corporate governance). Whilst the last three concepts are familiar, directorship represents a new notion which identifies the way boards create value within corporations. The integrity of a company is determined by the balance of these four management disciplines and their cohesion creates stability within the business and leads to success. However, accordingly to the DLMA argument, the four management disciplines are pulling the scare attention of the company in different directions: “Think of a company like a forest. While leaders focus on the forest, managers focus on the trees. And while a board in its assurance role is focused on protecting the firm from what is hiding behind the trees, in its directorship role the board is focused on the value that lies beyond the forest”  The matrix  The DLMA analysis is illustrated through a 2x2 matrix structured on three levels: * Horizontal. The quadrants above the line are focused on value creation: risk taking, people-centric, about innovation and commercialization. Below the line represents the quadrants that focus on value protection: risk oversight, process-centric, about control and financialization. * Vertical. The left side of the matrix represents the board perspective, whilst the right side provides the executive role. * Diagonal. Assurance and leadership represents attitudes that can be practiced throughout the organisation without formal authority; whilst within directorship and management there are positions that demand the acquisition of their authority.  The analysis  The DLMA analysis is a framing tool aimed to create a simple but complete profile of the company. It consists in few questions which determine where the company sits in the value creation/value protection matrix. The information is then transformed into the company profile. The model provides detailed information with regards to the aspirational and present structure of the company and identifies the individual and collective attitude toward it.

At its inception, the firm was heavily influenced by historic styles such as Renaissance style and Art Deco as is seen in St. Cecilia's Cathedral and The Ivy Tower Hotel and Residence. Their largest project, the Old Federal Building, located in Omaha, Nebraska, exhibits a bridge between these historic styles and the brutalist style that their later work was done in, as is seen in its use of both historic materials such as granite and limestone and modern materials of steel and reinforced concrete. Their brutalist style was fully realized in the 1950s and 1960s in their design of campus buildings for the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and is especially present in the exposed concrete construction and fortress-like structure of Behlen Laboratory.

Early life  Born in Morristown, New Jersey, Naegle was raised in Succasunna, New Jersey, in a Roman Catholic home with six siblings. During high school in the 1960s, he became interested in the African-American struggle for civil rights and social justice, particularly with its commitment to nonviolence as the means to bring about democratic change.  Civil rights work  After attending the University of Bridgeport (CT) for one year, he left to join VISTA (Volunteers In Service To America), and worked for a year in the Hilliard Houses Senior Center (Chicago, IL) an agency of Hull House Association. As his interest in nonviolence and pacifism grew, he decided to confront the selective service system, writing a letter to his draft board stating that he could not cooperate with the Selective Service and would refuse induction where he called. He was immediately summoned to report for induction, did not appear, but was never indicted because the local draft board had acted improperly in his case. He moved to New York City in January 1970 and found a studio apartment in Spanish Harlem. He worked as a psychiatric technician at the New York State Psychiatric Institute until September 1972, both in the children's ward and on a unit researching bipolar disorder. During this time he also attended night school at the Germain School of Photography in lower Manhattan and began taking photographs with a medium format camera (Rolleiflex, Bronica, Yashica).  Relationship with Bayard Rustin  He met Bayard Rustin in April 1977. > The day that I met Bayard I was actually on my way to Times Square. We were > on the same corner waiting for the light to change. He had a wonderful shock > of white hair. I guess he was of my parents' generation, but we looked at > each other and lightning struck. After a few months, the two became steady partners. Naegle returned to school in the fall of 1977, studying at Fordham University, where he was hired to work in the Development Office and in the Graduate School of Education. He was graduated summa cum laude in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in Studio Art. He moved in with Rustin who resided in the Mutual Redevelopment Houses (Penn South). In 2016 Rustin's residence was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Because same-sex marriage was illegal at the time, Rustin legally adopted Naegle in 1982 (an instance of same-sex adult adoption). The two were together for 10 years until Rustin's death in 1987. On November 20, 2013, Naegle accepted the Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in honor of Rustin's work of 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

It was his seventh visit to the United States and his first visit after succeeding the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012. During the period of the visit, Xi attended the US–China Internet Industry Forum, visited the White House and met US President Barack Obama, and attended the 70th anniversary of the United Nations. Background Xi's visit occurred at a time of high tensions in China-US relations. The Wall Street Journal quoted experts who said Xi's US visit was to promote local technology companies and to ask the US government to not retaliate in response to accusations regarding the People's Republic of China having engaged in hacking activities, but Beijing has repeatedly denied the allegations of the United States. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi's visit was to promote trust between the two countries. Before this visit, the United States Congressional-Executive Commission on China held a hearing on human rights. Experts and members of Congress in attendance called on President Obama to ask Xi Jinping to stop the persecution of Tibetans, Uyghurs, religious groups, non-governmental organizations, intellectuals, democracy advocates, and supporters of \\"universal suffrage\\" in Hong Kong. Xi had previously visited the United States six times. His first visit was as part of a corn industry delegation to the state of Iowa in 1985. His most recent visit in 2013 was informal, in which he went to Sunnylands in California, and met with US President Barack Obama. Process=September 22: Arrival at Seattle and Speech Giving On September 22, 2015, Xi Jinping, and his wife, Peng Liyuan, arrived at Paine Field and stepped off an Air China aircraft at about 9:30 am (Pacific Daylight Time). Before his arrival at the Westin Seattle Hotel, protesters gathered downtown to highlight the Chinese government's human rights abuses and to voice other concerns, including Falun Gong practitioners. Supporters of Xi were also present with Chinese flags. The protesters dispersed by 6:00 pm. In the evening, Xi attended a banquet speech at the Westin Seattle Hotel, meeting with Governor of Washington State Jay Inslee, Mayor of Seattle Ed Murray, Senator Patty Murray, Congressman Rick Larsen, and former US Ambassador to China Gary Locke. In his speech, he mentioned several contentious issues in China–US relations, including on cybersecurity and China's economy. Xi's speech cited elements of American culture, included Sleepless in Seattle and the poet Walt Whitman. He also talked about his teenage years working on a farm in Yanchuan County, Shaanxi, China, during the Cultural Revolution. He linked this to the Chinese Dream, an individual work ethic which would strengthen the Chinese nation as a whole. Xi reiterated that China is against currency wars and will not lower the renminbi rate to boost exports. On the topic of his anti-corruption reforms, Xi said, \\"It has nothing to do with a power struggle. In this case, there's no House of Cards\\" - a reference to the Netflix political drama, which tops the list of most illegally downloaded shows in China. September 23: Visiting and meeting business executives in Seattle Xi announced China will buy 300 Boeing aircraft. On the second day of his trip, Xi visited Boeing Everett factory and viewed the final assembly lines for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Boeing 777 and Boeing 747-8. Xi announced China will buy 300 Boeing aircraft, included 250 single-aisle Boeing 737s and 50 widebody jets for US$38 billion and build its first factory in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China. It will be Boeing's first non-US factory. The Chinese company Inspur and Cisco Systems said they will jointly sell networking technologies and products in China. After his Boeing visit, Xi attended an Internet industry forum held at the headquarters of Microsoft, located in Redmond. He said China would prioritize Internet security and defended self-governance at the country level with respect to Internet regulations. Thirty US and Chinese technology executives attended this forum and posed for a photo with Xi and Chief of the State Internet Information Office Lu Wei, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, Amazon.com's CEO Jeff Bezos, Alibaba's CEO Jack Ma, and Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella. Executives from Google and Uber, did not appear in this photo. Before photographing, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg spoke to Xi in Mandarin. On September 21, The Washington Post reported that technology executives were recommended to attend this forum, or risk their companies facing greater regulatory scrutiny in China. Xi also visited Microsoft, where he met with Bill and Melinda Gates as well as senior executives and board members of the company. He had the opportunity to preview new technologies being developed by Microsoft. Nadella gifted him a 3D printed model of the Liulinhai, the first Chinese ship to dock in the United States, in Seattle, in 1979 after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and the People's Republic of China. In the afternoon, Xi Jinping visited Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Washington. He provided opportunities for students to experience Chinese music, government and culture. Lincoln's football players presented Xi with a Lincoln Abes jersey emblazoned with the number \\"1\\". Xi reciprocated with gifts of books and ping-pong equipment. He also invited 100 Lincoln High students to visit China in 2016.

The White House invited Anita Lo, an Asian-American chef, to serve as a guest chef and to design the menu with Chinese elements. This state dinner's guests included US technology executives like Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and Larry Ellison, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

Read was taken prisoner by Confederate partisans from Mosby's Rangers during a surprise raid on the town on October 18, 1864 and executed later that day near Vienna, Virginia. Early life and prewar activities John Read was born in Lisbon, Connecticut, on February 6, 1814 to a family of prominent Baptist ministers. The family moved to Oswego, New York, and eventually John and his brothers Caleb and Hiram Read, and his sister Miranda Read Chappell, settled in Fairfax County, Virginia in the 1850s. The Read brothers, their sister, and their families were original founding members of the Columbia Baptist Church, the first Baptist congregation in the village. Hiram Read, John's younger brother and an ordained minister, served as the church's first pastor from its founding in 1856 to the onset of the Civil War in 1861. Columbia Baptist Church, Falls Church, Virginia. Taken 1862 by Matthew Brady, photographer. Although John Read is frequently referred to in local histories as \\"Reverend\\", he had no formal seminary training and likely served as a lay minister, preaching on occasion. The 1860 United States Census for Fairfax County, Virginia lists his occupation as that of a farmer, living with his wife and five children on land near Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia. Wartime activities John Read and his family fled Northern Virginia in July 1861 after the disastrous Union defeat at the Battle of First Manassas and moved to the safety of Washington DC. He returned to Falls Church in 1862 once federal forces had occupied the town and lived in his brother's house on Broad Street.Gernand, p. 205. Read remained an outspoken abolitionist and Union supporter in a small Virginia village where many residents had strong secessionist sentiments and family members fighting with Confederate forces. Along with his daughter Betsy, Read established a school in Falls Church to educate the local African American population and the large number of former slaves crossing into Union lines from further south. The father and daughter established both a \\"Sabbath school\\" to teach Scripture along with a \\"day school\\" where instruction in basic reading and arithmetic were taught to classes as large as fifty to sixty people. Obtaining outside funding for the school was very difficult, and Read appealed to Emily Howland, a Quaker philanthropist and abolitionist, for financial assistance: \\"I have made a number of applications, but have not been able to get anything toward sustaining a school among them...Here is a work for somebody to do. The door is open. Men wimmen [sic] and children are anxious to learn. But as they are cut off from all help from the government and the charitable societies it depends up individual alone if an thing is done...I believe these people should not be forgotten or neglected...I am willing to put shoulder to the wheel and the thing rolling so far as I can...\\"Emily Howland papers, reproduced courtesty Dept. of Manuscripts and University Archives, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. Read's activities during the war were not confined to education. There is evidence that he provided military intelligence to Union forces in the area regarding the activity of Confederate partisans under the command of John S. Mosby. A Union dispatch dated August 10, 1863 reported the following incident: \\"It is reported that one of our cavalry pickets was fired on last night while on duty near Falls Church. A Mr. Reed, resident of that place, says he knows that Mosby's headquarters are only about 5 miles from Falls Church, where he had about 40 men. My cavalry force is not sufficient to send out a large enough party to verify this information and keep up the regular nighly patrols. Very respectfully, G.A. DeRussy, Brigadier-General, Commanding.\\"The War of the Rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies. Series 1, Vol.XXIX, Part 2, p.26.

The Home Guard was drawn from the male civilians of the town and integrated significant numbers of African Americans in the force. These armed and unarmed men patrolled the town at night to protect against raids from Confederate forces, and developed a system of signal horns to alert the regular Union forces in the event of an attack. The raid on Falls Church Colonel John S. Mosby, CSA The forces of Colonel John Singleton Mosby's 43rd Battalion, Virginia Cavalry conducted an extensive guerrilla campaign behind Union lines in Northern Virginia from 1863 to 1865. In 1864, towns and Union outposts in Fairfax and Loudon Counties were frequent targets of surprise attacks from mounted cavalry from Mosby's Rangers seeking to capture Federal horses, supplies, and prisoners. Captain Montjoy, wood engraving 1867 On the early morning of October 18, 1864, Captain Richard Montjoy led a contingent of at least 75 men from Company D of Mosby's command on a nocturnal raid into Falls Church.OR, Series 1, Vol. XLIII, Part 2, p.414.

Montjoy and his men made a hasty retreat and headed west up the Alexandria Turnpike (current Leesburg Pike) toward present day Tysons Corner and Vienna. Read and Jackson were taken to a pine grove near where the Washington & Old Dominion railroad crosses the Piney Branch tributary of Difficult Run, and shot in the head at close range. Read was killed instantly, with the official Union army report stating that: \\"There is no doubt concerning the murder of Mr. Reed, the surgeon, who has made an examination of the body, states the skull at the base of the brain is blown to atoms, and the flesh about the wound is filled with powder, as if the pistol had been placed close to the head.\\"OR, p.415. Jackson miraculously survived the attempted execution with the loss of an ear, and was able to walk back to Falls Church to notify the Read family. Read's daughter and sister in law were forced to retrieve the body themselves when Union troops declined to do so for fear of encountering Mosby's forces that may have remained in the area.Evans, p. 51. Aftermath of Read's killing The gravestone of John D Read, at the Falls Church Episcopal Church. John Read was buried in the graveyard at the Falls Church Episcopal Church, where he lies next to his wife and daughter. After her father's execution, Betsy Read closed her school for freedmen. She wrote to Emily Howland on October 23, 1864, informing her that, \\"I have before me three letters from you addressed to My Father. Who is no more in this world. Miss Howland it is sad news to tell but My Dear Father has been shot yes cruely murderd by the Rebels. As to the school I had concluded to take, I do not now feal as though I wanted to have any thing to do with it...I do not think it would be advisable at this present time for any one to commence a school that is a colord School for at this time the Rebs are looking down on us And I should not be surprised if they should come down here again tonight...\\"Emily Howland papers. Emily Howland herself wrote a tribute to John Read, stating that, \\"He was much interested in the improvement and elevation of the colored people, which marked him for the hatred of the misguided wretches who rob and murder in the interest of slavery.\\" Read's death was reported in both local and Northern newspapers. The Evening Star in Washington, DC proclaimed his killing as an example of \\"Rebel Diabolism\\" and accused Mosby's men of committing \\"some of the most devilish deeds of cold blooded murder ever recorded\\" by \\"cutting his throat from ear to ear.\\" A Columbus Ohio newspaper lamented that \\"the guerrillas of Mosby's gang are becoming bold in their depredations\\" and \\"these outrages so near to Washington are beginning to be regarded as a serious disgrace.\\" Modern memorials to John Read Historical marker on W+OD Park at site of Read execution. The events of Read's killing are commemorated in a historical marker at mile marker 13.6 on the Washington and Old Dominion Regional Park entitled \\"Terror by the Tracks\\" which relates the details of his life and execution. A plaque describing the raid on Falls Church by Mosby's men, entitled \\"Living in Fear\\" was placed at 440 West Broad Street as part of the Virginia Civil War Trails system. Read family Read’s brother, the Rev. Benjamin L. Read, a Baptist Missionary, lived in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois. He and his wife Sarah Read later relocated to Trading Post, Kansas. In 1858 the Rev. Benjamin Read was rescued by Sarah after being shot and left to die by Missouri slave catchers in the \\"Marias Des Cygnes Massacre\\". Rev. Read survived and later served as the Chaplain of the Kansas 15th Cavalry under Charles Jennison. He later became a Justice of the Peace in Osawatomie, Kansas, and was listed as an honored guest from Kansas at the Colored People’s Convention in Boston, Mass, in 1865. The Rev. Benjamin L. Read is listed on the \\"Marias Des Cygnes Martyrs Memorial\\" monument near Trading Post, dedicated to those both wounded and killed there. References=Sources * Evans, Thomas, and Moyer, James.

Originally conceived as a city beautification project to clean up the city's waterfront in the 1850s, the street was taken over by the coming of the railways to Toronto in 1850. The railway eventually moved to an elevated viaduct, leaving only the eastern section of the street today. The area, east of Yonge Street, was dominated by industrial uses until the second half of the 20th century. As the harbour declined as a transfer point, the railway and industrial uses left the area. The Esplanade was redeveloped into a residential area, known as the \\"St. Lawrence Neighbourhood\\" in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This neighbourhood consists of generally low-rise and mid-rise housing - condominiums, public housing, cooperatives and some town homes between Jarvis and Parliament Streets south of Front Street. In the blocks between Jarvis and Parliament, the southern part of the street (and the former rail tracks) were converted to a long strip of park and recreation space for the residents - David Crombie Park. The stretch between Scott Street and Market Street is a popular restaurant area. Description The Esplanade now begins as a two-lane street at Yonge Street, south of Front Street, north of the railway viaduct. To the north is the Sony Centre for the Arts with the \\"L Tower\\" condominium tower wedged in behind. Going east, both sides of the street are lined with late 20th-century or early 21st century mid-rise and high-rise condominium projects. On the ground floors are numerous restaurants and retail stores. The north side of the street has a wide enough sidewalk that the restaurants have patios. Further to the east, along the north side, are older industrial buildings, such as the Greey's Toronto Mill Furnishing Works Factory at #70, which have been repurposed into commercial space. The street continues as a two-lane with wide north-side sidewalk east of Church Street as far west as Market Lane. Between here and Jarvis Street is the south building of St. Lawrence Market on the north side and the temporary location of the Market's farmer's market building. From the east of Jarvis, The Esplanade is primarily residential, and primarily low-rise. The street is a two-lane road, with a large open space along the south side, used for park and recreation space. On the south side of the open space is the St. Lawrence housing development. Along the north side are various late 20th century low- rise apartment projects. The St. Lawrence Recreation Centre is located along the north side of the street, east of Sherbourne, next to Market Lane Public School. This street form continues east to Berkeley Street, one block west of Parliament Street. On the north-west corner is the Berkeley Castle, the former 1871 Toronto Knitting & Yarn Factory, repurposed as commercial space. History View of Wholesale Fruit Market, former GWR rail station In the 1840s, Toronto's waterfront was a combination of wharves and squatter buildings. The area where The Esplanade is today was then part of the harbour, south of the shoreline. The Esplanade, a -wide road, was proposed, just south of Front Street, with new water lots made from cribbing and filling of the shore to the south. The waterfront was extended to a survey line from the point of the Gooderham windmill west to a point due east of the old Fort Rouillé. The new Esplanade was built in the 1850s at a cost of £150,000. Ostensibly for carriages and carts, the roadway eventually became primarily the route for rail lines in the central core. In exchange for of the Esplanade, the railways underwrote the infilling of the harbour. The Esplanade and infill project was complete by 1865. The project was the start of the railways taking over the entire Esplanade to the west of Yonge Street, and almost all of the harbour area. Gates were added to hold traffic as trains ran past each intersection. The Grand Trunk Railway built its first station at Bay Street and The Esplanade before building the first Union Station at York Street and The Esplanade. The Union Station would be replaced by a new Union Station in 1873 at the same location. The current Union Station was built in the 1910s and 1920s, and the new viaduct took over the Esplanade course permanently. By then, landfill had extended the waterline further south. The Esplanade once ran west from Yonge Street to Spadina Avenue with rest lost to re-development: Metro Toronto Convention Centre from John Street to Lower Simcoe Street; SkyWalk from Lower Simcoe Street to York Street (former CNCP Building and Canadian National Express Building and partially by old Union Station); Union Station built over section from Bay Street to York Street; Union Station Bus Terminal (previous CP Express and Transport Building) covers area from Yonge to Bay and uses old section of road as an internal roadway for buses. A new section of the Esplanade West (west of Bay Street to Spadina) emerged in the 1990s but renamed as Bremner Boulevard in honour of former Toronto Public Works Commissioner Ray Bremner (died 2004).https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2019/06/19/stretch-of-bremner- blvd-renamed-raptors-way-to-commemorate-championship.html. Portion from east of York Street was renamed as Raptors Way in 2019.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/raptors-way-bremner- toronto-1.5182215 The Great Western Railway built its rail station at the intersection of Yonge Street and The Esplanade. After the viaduct was built and passenger rail operations moved to the Union Station to the west, the building was converted to a freight office, then to the Toronto Wholesale Fruit Market. The location became part of the site for the new O'Keefe Centre for the Performing Arts (now the Sony Centre) in 1960. The Fruit Market and the wholesale market west of the St. Lawrence Market moved out of downtown to the Ontario Food Terminal by the Humber River to the west.

Raja, while waiting by his disabled car, for a tow truck, in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Raja, who was in plainclothes and in an unmarked white van, approached Jones, who was waiting by his disabled vehicle on a highway exit ramp. Within seconds, Raja fired six shots at Jones, striking him three times. After the shooting, Raja falsely claimed to investigators that he had identified himself as a police officer and shot Jones in self-defense; both assertions were disproved by an audio recording of the fatal shooting. On June 1, 2016, Raja was charged with manslaughter by culpable negligence and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm. He was convicted of the charges on March 7, 2019, following an eight- day jury trial. Raja was sentenced to 25 years in prison on April 25, 2019.  Corey Jones biography  Jones was born to father Clinton Jones, Sr., who renovated houses, and mother, Anita Banks, a guidance counselor, who died from cancer in 2006. Jones' older brother, C. J. Jones, was a football player at University of Iowa and from 2003 to 2009 played as a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). Jones' sisters are Melissa Jones-Elliott and Chanda and Cevon Jones; his stepmother is Katie Jones. Jones was black, and had a very large extended family; among his cousins are NFL defensive tackle Vince Wilfork and NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin. He lived in Lake Worth, Florida. Jones attended Christa McAuliffe Middle School in Boynton Beach, Florida, where he played the French horn. His entire family was musical, and played instruments at home and at church. Jones graduated from Santaluces Community High School in Lantana, where he played football.Lulu Ramadan, Boynton man killed by Gardens police was former NFL player's brother, Palm Beach Post (October 20, 2015). Jones then graduated from the University of Akron with degrees in business administration and music. He worked as a youth mentor at My Brother's Keeper, a nonprofit organization that helps African- American youths. Jones worked at the Delray Beach Housing Authority for eight years. He was an inspector/assistant property manager, a job that involved inspecting housing units to make sure they were livable. The position also required assisting tenants and landlords with communication. Jones also worked part-time as a drummer. He played in a band at his church, the Bible Church of God in Boynton Beach, where his grandfather, Sylvester Banks, Sr., is a bishop. He also played with a band called Future Prezidents with bandmates that included Boris Simeonov and Mathew Huntsberger.

His grandfather was a police chief in Pakistan. He worked for a small Florida police department for several years prior to joining the Palm Beach Gardens police. Raja is married with two children .  Death  On Sunday, October 18, 2015, at about 3:15 am, a plainclothes police officer in an unmarked white van with tinted windows wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and a baseball cap, stopped by what he said was an abandoned vehicle. The Palm Beach Gardens police officer, Nouman K. Raja, approached the vehicle at the southbound exit ramp of Interstate 95 and PGA Boulevard. Raja, on duty doing burglary surveillance, said he was confronted by an armed subject, so he discharged his weapon and killed the man later identified as Jones, a musician and local housing authority worker. In total, Raja discharged his weapon six times and hit Jones with three shots. One bullet entered the side of Jones' body, went through his aorta, killing him, and ended up in the top part of his torso, while the other bullets went through his body, hitting his left elbow and right shoulder. Jones' arm was broken from the impact of one of the bullets. Raja was not wearing a body camera and his vehicle was not equipped with one. Jones, who was driving a Hyundai Santa Fe, had car trouble and first called his brother, C.J. Jones, who offered to come help him. Jones was due in church the next morning and needed his car so he told his brother not to come pick him up. Jones' bandmate, Huntsberger, came to help, bringing oil, but they were not able to get the car running. Jones called for a tow truck and with that assurance, Huntsberger left. Jones had been returning home to Boynton Beach, after playing a show in Jupiter, Florida, at Johnny Mangos Tiki Bar and Grill. He had been playing with his band, the Future Prezidents. Jones was on the phone with AT&T; roadside assistance when he was approached by the police officer. He had also called Florida Highway Patrol's line for assistance and AT&T; #HELP multiple times trying to get help. Jones was using his government-issued work phone, so the records are available under state law. Jones' body was found a good distance – – away from the vehicle, from which he appeared to have run. Jones had a .380-caliber gun, which he had purchased three days prior to the shooting and for which he had a concealed carry license. It was found on the ground between Jones' body and his car and had not been discharged. Investigation and response  The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office conducted an independent investigation of the incident. The Palm Beach Gardens Police Department released a 90-page personnel file on Raja. The FBI assisted the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office in its investigation. Raja was an adjunct police academy instructor at Palm Beach State College, where he taught part-time. He was put on administrative leave from the college, as well as the police department, which is normal policy when an officer-involved shooting occurs. Raja previously worked at Atlantis Police Department in Atlantis, Florida, from 2008 to 2015. On November 11, 2015, Raja's employment with the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department, which was in a six-month probationary status from hire date April 13, 2015, was terminated. Around the same time, Raja's employment with Palm Beach State College ended, as a condition of his employment was his job working in the criminal justice system. Jones' family is represented by Benjamin Crump, who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, as well as attorney Daryl D. Parks. On October 31, a funeral for Jones was held at Payne Chapel AME Church in West Palm Beach. Apostle Sharon Walker delivered the eulogy. Reverend Al Sharpton delivered words to the family. Criminal conviction of Raja On June 1, 2016, a grand jury charged Raja with manslaughter by culpable negligence and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm. Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg announced that the grand jury concluded Raja had no justification to shoot Jones, and the charging documents \\"allege that Raja never identified himself to Jones as a police officer as he drove up to the stranded motorist, yelled commands, and then opened fire.\\"Wesley Lowery, Plainclothes officer who killed Florida church drummer is charged with manslaughter, attempted murder, Washington Post (June 1, 2016). Raja was arrested and his bond was set at $250,000. After making bail, Raja was released from the Palm Beach County Jail and placed under house arrest. A variety of conditions of pretrial release, including GPS monitoring and surrender of Raja's passport, were imposed.Michelle Quesada, Jason Hackett, & Christina Noce, Nouman Raja's makes $250K bail, remains in jail, will be on house arrest after release, WPTV (June 2, 2016).Christina Noce & Alyssa Hyman, Nouman Raja now under house arrest after release from jail: Arraignment scheduled for June 14, WPTV (June 4, 2016). On January 17, 2017, investigators publicly released evidence in the case, including \\"more than 3,000 pages of documents and 50 video and audio recordings,\\" in response to a public records request made by the Palm Beach Post and nine other news outlets. Included in the evidence were audio tapes from the phone calls to AT&T; Roadside Assistance and 9-1-1 were released. Although Raja had told investigators previously that he had called 9-1-1 before shooting Jones, the audio recording of Jones' roadside assistance call showed the final shot had been fired 33 seconds before Raja dialed. The recording also showed that Raja never identified himself to Jones as a police officer. In a State Attorney's Office report released on January 17, 2017, prosecutors state that Officer Raja lied to investigators, giving an account of events that contradicted the evidence. On January 18, 2018, defense attorneys for Raja filed a motion to dismiss all charges citing Florida's \\"stand your ground\\" laws. In the motion, Raja claims that he identified himself as a police officer as he exited the van, that Jones \\"immediately jumped out, saying 'I'm okay, man'\\" as he approached the vehicle, and that Jones then \\"immediately drew a gun and pointed it at Officer Raja.\\" Defense attorneys claim that Raja \\"repeatedly yelled for [Jones] to put his hands up and to 'drop the gun.'\\" Raja further stated he saw the silver muzzle pointing at him, and that he believed the gun was equipped with a red laser. On March 7, 2019, Raja was found guilty of manslaughter by culpable negligence and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm, following an eight-day jury trial. On April 25, 2019, Raja was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Raja's scheduled release date is February 27, 2044, but under Florida Parole and Probation guidelines his minimum release date is May 29, 2040. As of September of 2019, Raja was being held at the Wakulla Correctional Institution in Crawfordville, a minimum- to medium-security-level prison southeast of Tallahassee. Civil suit against City and Raja On July 6, 2016, the family of Corey Jones filed a wrongful death suit, naming the City of Palm Beach Gardens and Raja as defendants.

Background  In December 2010, the Kohler Company and United Auto Workers Local 833 reached agreement on a new five-year labor contract, that covered approximately 2,300 union workers at the company's two Sheboygan County, Wisconsin manufacturing locations. The contract passed 1,152 to 717, with 62 percent of union members voting to ratify the deal and 38 percent voting no. Throughout negotiations, Kohler Company officials insisted labor concessions were needed as the company's Sheboygan County manufacturing plants are easily the company's most expensive to operate, and products produced there are no longer competitive. The deal included a five-year wage freeze, higher health care premiums and the creation of a two-tiered wage and benefit system. It also allowed for the limited use of temporary workers.  Past strikes  The first Kohler Company strike, which began in 1934, lasted seven years and resulted in the shooting deaths of two strikers during a riot outside the company’s factory. The second strike was in 1954 and lasted 6 years. It was marred by acts of violence and vandalism. The third strike, which occurred in 1983 and lasted several weeks, saw car windows smashed by demonstrators and two union members injured by a motorist who drove his vehicle through a picket line.  Timeline = Before the strike  The Board of Directors of the Kohler Company elected David Kohler the company president and CEO on April 29, 2015, passing leadership of the family business to Herbert Kohler, Sr. grandson. The 76 year old Herbert Kohler, Jr. would continue as company chairman and would oversee the company's hospitality and real estate group. On November 11, 2015, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported negotiations between the company and the United Auto Workers were continuing, but with a deadline laid down by the union approaching, the two sides were \\"not even close to an agreement,\\" said Tim Tayloe, president of UAW Local 833. On November 13, workers held an informational picket outside the Kohler Company owned-and-operated The American Club ahead of a possible strike. On November 14, the Kohler Company released its \\"last, best and final offer.\\"  The strike begins  On the morning of November 15, 2015, an estimated 1,800 UAW Union members attended a meeting at Sheboygan South High School. 94 percent voted down the proposed Kohler Company proposal and approving a strike. The second day of the strike on November 16 began with workers marching 1.58 miles from Emil Mazey Hall in the Town of Sheboygan to the Kohler Company Headquarters. Closed entrances to the company campus caused traffic congestion for morning commute with traffic backed up into nearby cities of Sheboygan and Sheboygan Falls. About 150 union employees were blocking the only company entrance as of 6 a.m. and preventing non-union employees from entering. Three days into the strike on November 17, Sheboygan County Judge James Bolgert issued a temporary injunction barring picketers from interfering with traffic near Kohler Company property. The temporary injunction issued Tuesday bars demonstrators from interfering with traffic on public roads and with vehicles entering or leaving Kohler Co. property. It also restricts picketers from seizing and occupying Kohler property, including driveways. On the fourth day of the strike, UAW Local 833 told Wisconsin Public Radio that the company has not responded to a request for more contract talks. During the first week of the strike, the Village of Kohler has also asked for help from the Sheboygan County Sheriff's Office and the neighboring Sheboygan Falls Police Department with traffic control. On the seventh day of the strike, union members and supporters held mass picket in support of striking Kohler Company workers on November 21 during company's American Club hosts its popular Wisconsin Holiday Market. The street in front of the American Club and the Kohler Company headquarters was closed to traffic during the picket.  Resolution  After 32 days, the strike ended as UAW Local 833 and Kohler struck a deal which was ratified by 91% of the union. The deal secured wage increases for Tier A and B employees, narrowing the pay gap between new hires and older workers. Pension benefits were improved and healthcare premium increases were minimized. http://archive.jsonline.com/business/kohler-employees-vote-on-new-contract- proposal-b99635971z1-362701091.html  References  External links  * Photos and video of 2015 Kohler Strike Kohler Company Sheboygan County, Wisconsin Kohler family of Wisconsin 2015 labor disputes and strikes Labor disputes in the United States Labor disputes in Wisconsin 2015 in Wisconsin History of Wisconsin ","title":"2015 Kohler strike"},{"id":"48564120","text":"This was a new event on the ITF Women's Circuit.

Built in the 1840s, this Neoclassical house was the residence of internationally recognized Puerto Rican scientist Agustín Stahl (1842–1917) from 1865 until his death. The house was not only his home, but also his medical office, laboratory, and storehouse for his collections in natural history and anthropology. The house has been acquired and partially restored by the municipal government of Bayamón, which has long-term plans to establish a museum in the building.. Trained as a physician in Germany and maintaining only a modest income as a local doctor, Stahl nevertheless received honors in anthropology, natural sciences, and medicine by 1877. In the late 1870s, he entered the agricultural sciences in response to a sugarcane plague in Puerto Rico. In the 1880s, he published massive and well regarded reference texts on the zoology and botany of the island, and later important works in ethnology and demography. In the latter part of his life, he became a leader in public health efforts in Puerto Rico and published works in Puerto Rican history. Stahl is also remembered for his advocacy of Puerto Rican independence. His liberal political views led to suspicion from Spanish colonial authorities and his arrest and brief exile to the Dominican Republic during the Spanish–American War.

It was added to the South Australian Heritage Register on 23 September 1982; it was also listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. The Town Hall circa 1897 It was built in 1886-87 to a design by Alfred Barham Black and H. E. Hughes, after an earlier design by James Hill was condemned by architects. The design featured a large central auditorium, 75 feet by 45 feet with a stage. It was built by R. Honey from stone quarried at Quorn. The foundation stone was laid in June 1886 by the wife of the mayor, J. C. Knipe, and it was officially opened in May 1887 by Knipe's successor as mayor, David Drysdale. The building was severely damaged by fire in 1944, with the main hall, gallery, mayor's parlour, supper room, stage, dressing and cloak rooms, and mothers' and babies' association all destroyed. The facade, council chamber and town council office were saved. It suffered a further wall collapse while being used as an open-air entertainment venue in 1945 while awaiting reconstruction. It was rebuilt in 1946 at a cost of £30,000, and opened that August by Governor Willoughby Norrie. The original facade was retained as part of the rebuilt town hall. In 1983, the City of Port Augusta vacated the building when the new Port Augusta Civic Centre was completed. It was subsequently used by community groups for many years, but much of the building remained disused and it became increasingly derelict over time. In 2007, a teenage boy was injured after falling through the building's roof. In June 2015, it was placed up for sale by the state government; it was reported the previous month that the community tenants had been given one month's notice. At that time, the building was reported to have structural problems, including issues with asbestos and \\"substantial cracking in the walls due to movement of the original footing\\"; it had previously been reported to have problems with subsiding side walls and a crumbling facade, which had necessitated the erection of a verandah to protect pedestrians. Local state Liberal MP Dan van Holst Pellekaan has supported removing the heritage listing from all of the site except the facade, supporting retaining only the facade of the town hall amidst a general redevelopment of the site. It was reported in March 2016 that contracts for the sale the building had been signed, with the contract to require development within two years of purchase, but that settlement had not yet occurred. As of 2019, the building had been partially renovated by new owners Gulf Group, with the Port Augusta Boxing Club returning to a renovated space in the building, with a wider masterplan still in negotiation.

Shek qualified to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the United Kingdom via the Olympic Test Event in January that year. There, he finished 12th in the all-around qualification with a score of 86.482.
